I tried Manny ’s for the first time last week and was impressed .
It ’s one of the best Pale Ale ’s I ’ve had based in the Pacific Northwest along with Alaska ’s Sleeping Lady ’s Urban Ale .
The odd thing about Manny ’s ( and Urban Ale ) is that it ’s not available in bottles or cans .
You have to order a draught at a bar .
That ’s a problem when it comes to introducing the beer to new people – I did n’t even know it existed .
I had to ask a coworker who ordered it what it was all about .
I ’m definitely looking forward to trying other offerings from Georgetown Beer – I hear their seasonals are great .
Manny ’s description from Georgetown Beer ’s website : A careful selection of Northwest hops , premium barley , and our unique yeast give this ale a rich and complex malty middle with a snappy hop finish .
It ’s truly a micro that finishes crisp , clean , and smooth .
“ We have set it up like the Dead Sea Scrolls , to protect them but also to give the feeling of entering a kind of holy of holies , which is how we view it , ” said Hanoch Guttfreund , a physics professor , former president of the Hebrew University and curator of the exhibition .
“ And you can actually see Einstein work as you look at the pages . ”

Einstein ’s wife Elsa donated the manuscript to the Hebrew University on the occasion of its opening in 1925 and in a letter he thanked her for doing so .
A founder of the university and a member of its board , he donated all his papers to it upon his death .
And there , outside the room where the theory of general relativity is on display , are a few more of his papers , including a postcard he sent to his mother in 1919 after a British astronomer confirmed during an eclipse one of Einstein ’s key predictions .
It too offers a poignant mix of the celestial and personal .
“ Dear Mother ! ” it begins , “ Today some happy news .
Lorentz telegraphed me that the British expeditions have verified the deflection of light by the sun . ”
So sorry , he adds , to hear that you are not feeling well .
Einstein ’s relationship to Israel was complex .
A self - described universalist , he became a Zionist when he witnessed anti-Semitism in Europe .
Chaim Weizmann , Israel ’s first president , was a key influence on him .
Walter Isaacson , who wrote a 2007 biography of Einstein , said by telephone that Einstein wanted Jews to move here but did not back a separate Jewish nation - state until after it was declared in 1948 .
Alan Kohler had an interesting column in The Business Spectator recently ( " The cars that ate Australia " ) warning that as our car fleet transitions from the internal combustion to electric vehicles , local car manufacturers need to start looking to manufacture EV's or they ( and all their suppliers ) will end up shutting down .
Yesterday ’s announcement of an electric car trial by the WA government means that at least some politicians in Australia are at last taking seriously what is shaping up as the next great industrial revolution .
But unless something changes on the east coast , electric cars will be a disaster for Australian manufacturing .
At this stage it looks like no electric cars will be made here – Ford , GM , Toyota and Mitsubishi are all gearing up rapidly to make them somewhere else .
Yesterday the man in charge of the Perth trial , Professor Thomas Brauni , said : “ It ’s quite likely that you have a significant percentage of all cars being electric in 10 - 20 years time ” .
If he ’s only half right , Australia has a big problem .
Manufacturing industry rests on the car industry and is already in trouble because China ’s demand for raw materials is pushing the currency higher .
If Australia does n’t make electric cars , and there is a big switch from petrol to electricity over the next decade or two , manufacturing in this country will shut down .
While Australian manufacturing might not completely disappear along with the car industry ( even if globalisation has made much of it vanish already ) there would n't be much left in South Australia and Victoria - so those states may well decide to try and tempt the multinationals into upgrading their plants to produce EV 's once they start to gain significant market share .
Kohler also points out that there will be accompanying booms in clean energy generation and both lithium and copper production - which provides a number of opportunities for local companies .
Kohler had an article in a similar vein at The Eureka Report ( " Wheels of fortune " ) recently , looking at both clean energy companies linked to Better Place and lithium producers that could benefit from the electric vehicle revolution , like Talison Minerals , Galaxy resources and Haddington ( another Australian miner - Greenland Minerals And Energy - is hoping to develop a uranium / lithium deposit in Greenland ) .
It would be quite pointless to generate the electricity for the new era of transportation with brown coal , or even black coal .
The emissions would still be lower than petrol exhausts , but the gains from using renewable energy instead would be enormous .
In fact , electric cars can underpin the development of viable renewable energy industries in most countries .
Better Place plans to buy only renewables and expects to become Australia ’s largest buyer of wind power .
This is likely to a boon for Origin , AGL and Infigen from about 2013 .
Seventy percent of the world ’s mineral lithium comes from the Greenbushes mine in Western Australia , owned by a Canadian company called Talison Minerals .
The company announced in November last year that it planned to list in both Canada and Australia during 2010 but nothing has happened yet .
Another local producer is Galaxy Resources , an ASX listed company that owns a lithium / tantalum deposit near Ravensthorpe in WA .
Galaxy is currently at $ 1.18 and market cap of $ 178.4 million .
The stock was 25 ¢ a year ago and peaked at $ 2.21 in September last year because of a flurry of interest in lithium batteries around the time that A123 Systems Inc listed on Nasdaq , becoming the hottest new listing in 2009 .
Australian lithium mines are n't the only ones looking to increase production - The New York Times recently had an article on the surge of interest worldwide in the metal ( " The Lithium Chase " ) .
Toyota Tsusho , the material supplier for the big Japanese automaker , announced a joint venture in January with the Australian miner Orocobre to develop a $ 100 million lithium project in Argentina .
That deal came only days after Magna International , the Canadian car parts company that is helping develop a battery - powered version of the Ford Focus , announced that it was investing $ 10 million in a small Canadian lithium firm that also has projects in Argentina .
...
About 60 mining companies have begun feasibility studies in Argentina , Serbia and Nevada that could lead to more than $ 1 billion in new lithium projects in the next several years , while dozens of smaller projects are being proposed in China , Finland , Mexico and Canada .
...
In the meantime the four biggest current producers , which mine and otherwise gather lithium in Chile , Argentina and Australia , say they are planning to expand long - running projects as future demand warrants .
In Bolivia , which has almost half of the world ’s reserves , the leftist government is building a pilot production plant and is drilling exploratory holes .
That Bolivia is a remote , unstable country often hostile to foreign investment has helped spur interest in producing lithium in neighboring Argentina and Chile , in Australia , and in the United States .
Several Canadian and American companies are making claims about future production prospects in Nevada , though few analysts foresee large - scale production from that state .
While most experts are skeptical that meaningful amounts of lithium can be produced domestically , they maintain that adequate supplies will be available from sources outside of Bolivia for many years to come and note that the biggest producer , Chile , is a dependable American ally .
While the NYT is dubious about increased lithium production within the US , one american company which has garnered attention for its potential to is Simbol Mining , which is looking to extract lithium from the water flowing through geothermal power plants .
Most of the attention for large scale future production of lithium tends to focus on Bolivia , which has the world 's largest lithium resource soaked into the coating on the world 's largest salt flat , the Salar De Uyuni .
The subject of Peak lithium has been raised from time to time ( with recent commentary at Seeking Alpha and The Oil Drum ) with Jack Lifton ( author of the Seeking Alpha article ) arguing that lithium supplies will be insufficient to meet our needs while Keith Evans argues there is more than enough resources available .

“ We found , frankly , the industry was n’t ready to do much pre-foreclosure , ” she said .
“ But once it was either on the cusp of foreclosure or had been taken into the bank portfolio , banks really do not want to hold on to these properties because they do n’t know how to manage them , do n’t know what to do with them . ”
Working with borrowed money , Boston Community Capital buys homes after foreclosure and sells or rents them to their previous owners , providing new mortgages and counseling to the owners , who typically have ruined credit .
During the process the families remain in their homes .
Since late fall it has completed or nearly completed deals on 50 homes , with an additional 20 in progress , Ms. Hanratty said .
The organization is now trying to raise $ 50 million to expand the program .

Steve Meacham , an organizer at City Life / Vida Urbana , is one reason banks may be willing to sell their foreclosed properties to Boston Community Capital .
When families receive eviction notices , his group holds demonstrations or blockades outside the properties , calling on lenders to sell at market value .
It also connects the residents with the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau , whose students work to pressure lenders to sell rather than evict by prolonging eviction and “ driving up litigation costs , ” said Dave Grossman , the clinic ’s director .
“ So they ’re being defended legally , and we ’re ramping up the pressure publicity - wise , ” Mr. Meacham said .
“ And B.C.C. came in ; they had a part that buys properties and a part that writes mortgages .
It would n’t work without all three . ”
A focus of the program has been the working - class neighborhood of Dorchester , where home prices dropped 40 percent between 2005 and 2007 , compared with a 20 percent drop statewide , according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston .
Foreclosures and delinquencies there are more than twice the state average , the bank found .
In such neighborhoods , lenders and residents are hurt by evictions , which often leave vacant properties that invite crime and drive down values of neighboring houses , Ms. Hanratty said .
“ So it ’s in the lenders ’ interest to get fair market value as quickly as possible , and in the interest of the community to have as little displacement as possible . ”

I feel devastated .
Every time I think about it , I feel sick .
Mark Owen of Take
That is a love rat .
Speaking to the Sun – always the best way to confront your intimate problems – married Owen has confessed to multiple affairs .
In his defence he says that the final tryst happened before he was wed to his partner of five years .
Except that they were married only five months ago .
It always tickles me to hear liars ' justifications , the sliding scale of the cheat 's charter of values : cheating on girlfriend , wonderful ; cheating on wife , awful .
Yes , Owen looked virginal , but he was not .
Expelled from Cupid 's embrace , perhaps he can visit a gentlemen 's club ?
There , he and other serial , simultaneous - multiple - victim cheats such as footballer Ashley Cole and golfer Tiger Woods can cry big fat crocodile tears while fiddling with abject women so far beneath them in status , power and confidence that should their stories ever come to light , they wo n't have any leverage .
They say that only the insecure cheat .
That 's probably true .
But then insecurity lies behind most human endeavour , from an artist striving to create a masterpiece to a man so eaten up by jealousy that he murders his ex .
The expression of the insecurity is gendered , played out through the power dynamic that already exists in the world .
Insecure women harm themselves and slander and betray other women .
Insecure men abuse women .
They are not punished either by the mysterious forces of karma or by the people they are surrounded by , the employers , supporters , colleagues , friends .
Mark , Tiger and Ashley – and what a great team of roving provincial strippergrams they 'd make , with names like that – do n't " love " women , as compulsive male cheats are often forgivingly said to do .
They hate them .
If you spend years playing women , tricking women , duping women , lying to women , you are an abusive man .
It 's hardly a complicated issue .
If you 're a famous chap and want to sleep with many women , stay single .
Life will provide countless opportunities for sexual adventure .
Take every one , it sounds fun !
But do n't , at the same time , pretend to be a really nice decent guy , or let your partner live her life thinking happily that she got a great catch .
I 've met dozens of philanderers and they 're all the same .
They 're always the " really nice guys " who pay lip service to feminism in public and viciously betray women in private .
Their abusiveness is protected by their reputation for niceness .
There 's the bestselling novelist who namechecks his partner and mother in interviews .
The writer who often pens cute columns about his wife and kids .
The street poet with the soulful eyes and funky trainers .
They all use the same line : " I would n't mind if my partner was shacked up with some guy right now . "
Always , that partner is at home tending the kids , the house and her own career and would be devastated to discover what her one true love was doing .
At least this kind of deliberate , serial , mass , long - term cheating makes the perpetrator 's true nature obvious when it finally comes to light .
Why would any woman seek to salvage something from the final dregs of this pathetic game ?
Having been tricked by someone who lied throughout , she would naturally realise that his apology and pledges of future fidelity were lies too .
Having pretended to be devoted , he would then pretend to be remorseful , when in fact he was merely embarrassed .
A traitor 's gifts are nothing more than lavish bribes , his promises weightless confetti cut from a tissue of lies .
No doubt a woman who 's been played finds her adoration change instantly to disgust and sheer gratitude that he 's out of the picture .
The yearning to see him , no doubt , becomes overwhelming relief that he is no longer in her life .
No doubt ?
Owen and Woods have children .
What do their partners do now ?
Cheating is not just a betrayal but a type of blackmail , the ultimate lose - lose .
Walk , keep your dignity and principles , break up the family home ?
Or stay , lose your pride , sleep beside the one who backstabbed you , but keep the hearth - fire burning for the bairns ?
What would I do ?
Would I stand by my man , as the song goes ?
Hell no .
Cheats do n't change .
I 'd write a new ditty and the chorus would go : take out the trash , ladies .
Just take out the trash , because it stinks .

What is really the best timing for building a network marketing business ?
Is there really a “ best time ” to work your business ?
I believe there is .
Work your network marketing business on a DAILY or CONSISTENT basis .
I see a lot of people sign up with network marketing opportunities , but never seem to get anything going .
They do a little here and there but never begin to achieve what they started out to do .
It is not lack of ability or prospects , but a lack of consistent effort that costs them their success .
The best plan is to work your business every day .
There will be some days where you are totally buried in other things , and finding time will be nearly impossible .
On those days , make it a point to take at least a small action toward building your business .
It is n’t so much that this small action will make a world of difference by itself , but rather the impact it will have toward building a habit of daily action in your business .
What you are seeking is consistency .
Try to establish a habit of working your business daily .
If you prefer , work on it six evenings a week and take Saturday or Sunday off .
Pick a schedule that fits your lifestyle .
Just strive for a consistent pattern , otherwise it will be very easy to slip and go for days without doing anything at all .
If you are serious about building a real business , you ca n’t let that happen .
I ran into this quote which sums up a key truth for success in network marketing .
“ When nothing seems to help , I go and look at a stone cutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it .
Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two , and I know it was not that blow that did it , but all that had gone before . ”
— Jacob August Riis
For me , I found that organizing a daily schedule in advance helps me stay focused and on top of things .
When you wake up each day , if you know you have scheduled actions for your network marketing business , it is much easier to be consistent and stay on track .

WASHINGTON — With the Obama administration looking to score another major legislative victory , an array of pro-business groups and fiscal conservatives are mounting a well - financed campaign to scale back or block altogether the Democrats ’ plan to overhaul regulation of the financial industry .
By the time the campaign is over , opponents of regulation plans will probably have spent tens of millions of dollars to lobby Washington lawmakers , run advertisements and start petition drives .
It is an effort that many of the players , from the United States Chamber of Commerce down to smaller splinter groups , see as vital to their economic survival .
“ This is a re-ordering of our financial institutions for generations to come , ” Paul Schott Stevens , president of the Investment Company Institute , said last week at a meeting hosted by the chamber .
Wall Street executives say that although they support increased regulation , the changes sought by Democrats could exacerbate the problems that emerged in the 2008 economic crisis rather than fix them .
Among the targets of their criticism are the creation of a consumer fiscal protection agency , the establishment of a multibillion - dollar fund to head off bailouts of companies deemed “ too big to fail , ” and the regulation of derivatives as well as other high - risk trading instruments .
Terra preta means " black earth " .
More importantly , if less literally , it means fertile soil — created 1000s of years ago out of nutrient - starved rainforest dirt by the strange alchemy of charcoal .
No one knows exactly how Amazonian natives made terra preta , but that is n't stopping modern agriculture scientists from attempting to recreate , and build on , the successes of this ancient farming technique .
Using biochar — charcoal created in an oxygen - free environment — they 're hoping to improve soil quality and sequester carbon .
But first , they have to deal with that pesky little thing called evidence .
Biochar really is a promising product , but we 're only beginning to understand how promising it might be , where it would be most useful and , even , how it works .
The best biochar is made by pyrolysis , according to Kurt Spokas , Ph.D. , a USDA - ARS soil scientist and adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota .
Pyrolysis takes plants , animal manure or any other kind of organic biomass , traps it in an oxygen - free environment and heats it to around 550°C .
At the end , you 're left with biochar , and a mixture of hot gases and some liquids .
Condense the vapors and collect the liquids and you get liquid fuel and enough combustible gas to fire up the next batch of biomass .
Advocates have long hoped that biochar — spread over farm fields — would improve soil quality and crop yields , while simultaneously trapping carbon in the soil .
The science on the second goal is a little more clear - cut than the first .
Biochar definitely does imprison carbon , and does it better than normal charcoal , said John Bonitz , a farm outreach and policy advocate with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy .
The charcoal left behind by a campfire , for instance , is chemically made up of carbon joined to lots and lots of oxygen molecules , but is primarily ash and has lost most of its carbon to burning .
Like sorority girls in a slasher film , the oxygen is easily picked off by bacteria , which speeds up the process of decomposition , breaking the chemical bonds and leaving the carbon that does remain to drift back into the atmosphere .
Subtract the oxygen , however , and the carbon molecules get tough — forming ring structures that do n't easily shatter and are more resistant to microbial attack , Spokas said .
Lab research , done by him and others , suggests that these bonds have the potential to hold fast for anywhere between hundreds to hundreds of thousands of years .
That means less carbon in the atmosphere .
It 's also good news for anyone who'd like to see carbon neutral , or even carbon negative , biofuel production .
Of course , that 's in a test tube .
" There 's a whole suite of caveats that come along with those estimates because we can't mimic the natural environment in the laboratory , " Spokas said .
In fact , most of what we know about biochar comes from the lab .
Spokas ' team is one of the first in the United States to start running tests in the ( literal ) field , as part of the USDA - ARS multi-location biochar and pyrolysis research initiative .
However , they 've only been at that for two years .
Not long enough , he says , to make definitive statements , particularly when it comes to biochar 's impact on soil quality .
The key question — " Does biochar - infused soil lead to more crops and better soil fertility ? " — is still wide open .
But there is some tantalizing data coming out of those lab tests .
It seems that , by putting microbial life on slow - mo , biochar also works to trap nitrogen in the soil .
Not only does that mean less nitrous oxide — another greenhouse gas&mash ; in the atmosphere , it could also mean less nitrogen fertilizer applied to the ground , and less excess nitrogen leaching away into the water supply .
Spokas says field trials will make it clear what types of soil benefit the most from biochar — right now , it looks like the Midwest might not get that much of a boost , compared to , say , the sandy soils of the Southeast .
Researchers also want to find out whether biochar alone will do the trick , or if a successful soil stew needs more ingredients .
" Terra preta research indicates that there was kitchen garbage discarded with the charcoal , " said Bonitz .
" And that would increase the bacteria and fungi activities in the final product . "
Ultimately , the lack of information centers around the fact that terra preta is old and biochar , well , is n't .
" Currently all ongoing biochar research is on short time periods , maybe 10 years at most .
Whereas , with terra preta , we 're looking at the residual effects of 1000s of years , " Spokas said .
" It 's a good inference that we could see some positive benefits from biochar , but we 're still trying to figure it out .
And if there are any short - term negative effects , we would n't see those in the terra preta research . "

Constance McMillen unwraps a Super Sonic Burger from a bag full of tater tots at her kitchen table in Fulton .
Her long , dark hair is curled , and her face is made up .
She 's wearing a new black T - shirt that reads " I ( Heart ) NY . "
" Do you mind if I eat ? "
She is tired and hungry and has at least two more interviews with reporters on this Sunday evening , and it 's already 5 p.m .
It 's been a busy day for the 18 - year - old lesbian and a crazy week ever since Itawamba County Agricultural High School canceled her prom because she wanted to bring her girlfriend as her date .
She also wanted to wear a tux .
A media frenzy had Constance in New York City Friday , March 12 , taping for three national shows .
She and her family got back to town late Saturday night .
Photographers and stylists from People magazine came to her home Sunday for a photo shoot .
Her dad lies on the couch , trying to get a little rest before another heavy bout of media attention Monday morning -- they are supposed to be in Memphis to tape appearances on the " Joy Behar Show " and " Countdown with Keith Olbermann . "
She has more than 4,000 new friend requests on Facebook and almost as many messages that she has n't had time to return .
She 's hoping she can take a couple days off over spring break to relax .
For those who say she wanted all this attention , she says it 's the school district that created this circus , not her .
" They would rather cancel the prom because of the media coverage , " Constance says .
" That caused more media attention .
All this media is good .
People going through this will know to contact the ACLU or Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition .
Maybe it will encourage people to stand up for themselves . "
" This would n't have happened if you had the right last name , " Dana Stewart , Constance 's aunt , says .
Her grandparents nod in agreement .
" It 's always been this way here , " says David McMillen , Constance 's grandfather .
He went to the same high school and remembers which kids were allowed to get away with anything and those who were n't .
" It 's about being different or outside of being the norm , " Constance says .
Inspired by Ceara
Constance first challenged the school policy back in December .
She went to the vice principal and told him it was unfair .
She says he essentially agreed with her .
" I had heard about the Ceara Sturgis case .
She really inspired me , " Constance says .
Sturgis , who attends Wesson Attendance Center , wore a tux for her senior portrait .
Her school decided not to include her picture in its yearbook .
Sturgis challenged the policy .
With that encouragement , Constance started making her case at the school level first .
" I went through the chain of command , " she says .
Constance ran into a brick wall .
By January , she had learned that besides not being allowed to bring a same - sex date , she could n't wear a tux to the prom .
No girls would be allowed to wear pants .
" I do n't think you have to dress feminine if you are a girl , " Constance says .
Besides , she 's just not as comfortable in a skirt .
She also challenged this prom policy .
" Girls wear dresses , and boys wear pants , " the vice principal told her .
" That 's the definition of formal . "
" No , " Constance countered , " that 's your definition . "
" Formal dress " at her prom would allow girls to show cleavage and have skirts slit high up the thigh .
The tux Constance planned to wear would have covered her whole body .
Constance talked to Teresa McNeese , superintendent of Itawamba County Schools , about her desire to go to prom .
" What if I want to slow dance with my girlfriend ? " Constance asked McNeese .
" I 'm going to ask you not to push buttons , " McNeese said , according to Constance .
" I do n't like a lot of attention , " Constance says in between bites of her burger .
" I have a lot of respect for others .
I have a right to slow dance .
I 'm not asking people to be gay . "
When Constance took her complaint to the school - board attorney in January , the lawyer told her , " The prom is elective . "
Frustrated and upset , Constance went home crying that day .
She called her mom , Denise McMillen , who lives in Wiggins .
After a heart - to - heart talk , her mom put Constance in touch with gay - rights activists in Hattiesburg .
They put Constance in direct touch with the American Civil Liberties Union .
Her family supports Constance 's fight .
" A lot of people do n't like gay people , " Constance says .
" Our school promotes hiding who you are . "
In February , a freshman boy at Itawamba County Agricultural High School came to school dressed like a girl and was kicked out , Constance says .
He 's a home - school student now until he can take his GED exam .
To protest his treatment , 18 girls including Constance went to school dressed like boys in baggy pants , men 's shirts , boots and put their hair up in hats .
Constance wants school officials to see the pain that boy experienced .
" I want to help them understand , and maybe they can have compassion , " Constance says .
It baffles her why posters at school encourage kids to " Be Yourself " when it 's not school policy .
Tattooed right above her left wrist is a circle with the inscription " To thine own self be true . "
" That 's a Shakespeare quote .
I love Shakespeare , " Constance says .
On her left wrist are bunches and bunches of skinny bracelets .
One is a black - and - white braid of thin threads .
One is a yellow plastic band with hearts and the word " Princess . "
She has several skinny Silly Bandz , thin and squiggly , almost transparent little rubber bands .
" This one is a girl , " she says , pulling at a pink band .
She takes it off and rolls it around on the kitchen table .
" It 's not doing right . "
She fools with it some more , and then it magically takes the shape of the international woman 's silhouette on every rest - room door .
" See ? "
Classic American
Fulton is a small town controlled by a small group of conservatives , Constance says .
" This whole town wants to be like a Utopian type of place , " she says .
Coming into Itawamba County on U.S. 78 , a sign proclaims " Itawamba : Native American Name , Classic American Community . "
The high school sits on top of small hill and the neat campus looks more like a private school than a public one .
Nearby , houses under construction have solar panels on the roofs .
Banners around town welcome home the 155th Brigade of the Mississippi National Guard .
Joggers wearing Ole Miss sweatshirts run along the paved path along the Tombigee River .
While some at school and in town have been hostile to Constance , a lot of people have her back .
" For the most part , there 's good people here , " says David McMillen , Constance 's grandfather .
He says several boys who go to school with Constance called and offered to walk her to class if she wanted their protection .
" Yeah , " says Dana Stewart .
" I work at Shell , and a lot of people come in and say , ' It 's 2010 - - good grief . '
A lot of them are parents . "
Dale McMillen , Constance 's grandmother , says she is proud .
" I 've always told my children , you are no better than anyone else .
But you are just as good as anyone else , " she says .
" I raised them to stand up for what they believe in and not for being something they are not .
I love them unconditionally .
I 'll always stand behind them .
There 's nothing you can do so I 'd turn my back on you . "
Standing out on the carport now , the women in the family take a cigarette break .
" Did you tell her about your community service ? " Dale McMillen asks her granddaughter .
" No , I do n't want to be bragging , " Constance says , a little irritated and looking away .
" Well , you should . "
Dale McMillen is happy to brag about how Constance worked with the local food pantry and how she takes care of stray animals .
Constance goes inside the house .
" She stands up if boys hit or tease dogs .
She 'll speak up , " says her aunt Dana Stewart .
" I want people to know not Constance the gay girl , but Constance the person . "
Constance wants to stay in Fulton after graduation .
She 's planning on going to Itawamba Community College here in her hometown .
After that , she wants to transfer to the University of Southern Mississippi and get a degree in psychology and continue at USM for a graduate degree .
She wants to go into family counseling and do work with drug rehabilitation .
Her family jokes maybe she should run for office , maybe governor .
That does n't interest her too much .
" I just want a normal life , " she says .
As for the plans floating around to sponsor an alternative prom -- and there are at least four different groups proposing four different alternative proms -- Constance thinks that 's really nice , but it is just not the same as having the prom she planned to attend April 2 sponsored by the school .
" I want to go to my prom , " she says .

German scientists have discovered a new human species that lived in Siberia around 30,000 to 50,000 years ago .
The evidence changes the picture of pre-human habitation on Earth .
The species lived at the same time as modern humans and Neanderthals and shared a common ancestor with them .
Scientists found the fossilised remnants of a tiny finger bone that probably belonged to a small child .
Dr Johannes Krause from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany is the author of a paper on the finding which has been published in Nature .
He says the fossil was like nothing he had seen before .
" I did several analyses to make sure that this DNA is authentic , that this DNA is really old and that this DNA is what had seemed to be a new hominine lineage , " he said .
" A new discovery , different from human DNA and different from Neanderthal DNA , for example . "
His colleague and co-author , Professor Svante Paavo , was not initially convinced .
" It was of course absolutely amazing and I first really did n't believe him .
I thought he was pulling my leg , " he said .
The discovery crucially suggests the species were living at the same time and in the same place as modern humans and Neanderthals .
The deputy director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide , Dr Jeremy Austin , says it is a very significant find .
" They 've found this hominine lineage .
It 's not a modern human .
It 's not a Neanderthal .
It 's not a chimpanzee .
It 's something sort of halfway in between , at a time period when no - one thought that these sorts of ancestral human forms were still alive , " he said .
Professor Paavo says the new species shared a common ancestor with Neanderthals and modern humans .
The common ancestor left Africa about 1 million years ago .
" Maybe it is oversimplification to think about particular migrations out of Africa , " he said .
" There might have been more or less continuous flow , and the picture that 's going to emerge in the next years might be a much more complex one . "
It was only a few years ago that the ' Hobbit of Flores ' was discovered and proclaimed a new species .
Dr Austin says with the discovery of this new human in Siberia , scientists are adjusting to the possibility that four species were living at the same time when previously it was thought there were only two .
" If all this paper does is say there 's a whole pile of diversity out there , essentially there 's more human species we do n't know about , then that 's a really important finding . " he said .

It seems too much to hope for -- I mean , it
March 24 , 2010  --
The mysterious case of the missing heir to an Alabama potato chip fortune took another bizarre turn after investigators determined that the man found floating in a golf course pond , bound , gagged and shot in the head had committed suicide and tried to make it look like a murder .
The Jefferson County coroner determined that Major Bashinsky , a 63 - year - old lawyer from Mountain Brook , Ala. , had loosely bound his hands and taped his mouth shut , before wading into a pond at the Highland Park Golf Course in Brimingham and shooting himself in the head last month .
Inside Bashinsky 's mouth the coroner found a label off a Golden Flake chip bag , and attached to his body was a bottle that contained a " disjointed and threatening note , " said Jefferson County Chief Deputy Coroner Pat Curry .
Bashinsky 's hands were loosely bound with rope and his mouth was covered with duct tape " to make it appear he had been murdered , " said Curry .
The gun used in the suicide was found by divers in the pond , where Bashinsky 's body was discovered on March 15 , two weeks after he disappeared .
The coroner determined the gunshot wound to the head was self inflicted and the letter found on Bashinsky matched a similar note found in his car and a threatening letter sent to the Golden Enterprises , make of Golden Flake potato chips .
" We take all the evidence in toto and come to a ruling .
That ruling supports our finding that this was a suicide , " Curry said .
He said there were no signs of struggle against the rope or tape .
The Bashinsky family is the majority shareholder in the investment company that owns Golden Enterprises , a regional chip manufacturer that had $ 122 million in sales in the last fiscal year .
His late father , Sloan Bashinsky , was the former CEO of the company .
Bashinsky was last seen at a Birmingham office building on March 3 .
His car was found several days later , just two miles from the Highland Park Golf Course where the body was discovered .
On March 4 , Golden Enterprises received an anonymous letter critical of the Bashinsky family for making millions of dollars at the expense of the company 's workers .
The letter compared the family 's business practices to " vampires . "
Police Baffled by Motive in Potato Chip Suicide
Investigators said the note found on Bashinsky 's body was similar to those found in his car and the one sent on March 4 to the company .
" We believe right now that he drafted all of those notes himself , " said Sgt. Johnny Williams , spokesman for the Birmingham Police Department .
In a move reminiscent of a scene from the thriller " Silence of the Lambs , " Bashinky planted fake evidence on himself , police said .
" The piece of bag and the notes make it appear as if he wanted investigators to assume this was murder by a person angry about business , " said Curry .
Through an investment company controlled by Bashinsky 's stepmother , the family owns a majority 44.5 percent stake of Golden Enterprises stock , or 5.2 million shares , which amounts to dividends of $ 624,000 annually , according to the Birmingham News .
Bashinsky had no direct involvement with Golden Enterprises ' business operations .
Investigators said they had not yet determined a motive , and were looking to determine if Bashinsky had a life insurance policy .
" Now we know how he did it , " said Williams , " but we have n't quite figured it out why . "
Restoring vision to the blind is one of the epic promises of technology , sort of like flying cars , ray guns , and a lovable robot side kick .
Yet artificial sight is n’t a far off dream , it ’s getting much closer to reality with the Argus project .
Funded by the US Department of Energy and lead by Lawrence Livermore National Labs , Argus seeks to create an epiretinal prosthesis , a device that will take the image from a camera and send it to your brain via your optic nerve .
The first two phases of Argus ( which we call Argus I and Argus II ) have had extraordinary success with implants in more than 30 patients .
Now , LLNL is getting ready to launch Argus III – the third phase that will expand the number of patients , the quality of vision provided , and ease in which the device is implanted .
The Argus project has already restored sight to a few blind people , but given enough time , it could change the lives of millions .
There are other epiretinal prosthesis in development .
The one at MIT is particularly promising .
Yet Argus is at the forefront of the field .
It should be considering the resources : 5 US national labs , four major universities , a growing private company , and millions in funding .
With all this effort , the DOE hopes that retinal implants will be a meaningful solution for the 25 million people around the world who have lost their vision due to retinal problems ( such as macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa ) .
Right now Argus ( and all such projects ) are struggling just to match human capabilities .
Beyond that point , however , artificial retinas open the prospect of cybernetic vision .
Giving sight to the blind is just a few steps short of improving the vision of the sighted , or even giving everyone eyes that put Superman ’s to shame .
Of course , we ’re not there quite yet , and no one ’s even talking about cybernetic vision at LLNL .
Argus III is a meaningful step along the same path established by Argus I and Argus II .
In Argus I , it took patients about 15 seconds to recognize objects using the retinal implant .
In Argus II that was down to 2 - 3 seconds .
Argus I had implants that provided 16 pixels of resolution .
Argus II got up to 60 , enough for the edges of doors , or the shape of a building .
According to images from the LLNL site , the current implants prepared for Argus III will have 200+ pixels .
The DOE eventually wants 1000 pixels , at that point you could reliably make out someone ’s face .
Improving the pixel count is n’t easy as it depends on the number of electrodes that get attached to the retina .
The Argus device works by taking a thin - film electrode array and surgically implanting it onto the retinal tissue .
These electrodes communicate wirelessly with an external camera through a biocompatible electronics package that is attached to the array .
The entire assembly is smaller than it sounds and fits within the ocular cavity .
Increasing the resolution of Argus means placing more electrodes on that array , as well as developing the electronics package that can handle the signal and processing .
Not easily done , but every phase of Argus has improved in that direction .
At the moment , LLNL and associated researchers are focusing on getting the electronics of Argus III up to snuff .
Human trials have n’t started yet , but we ’ll let you know when they do .
Considering the size of Argus I and Argus II , you can bet that dozens of patients will receive a chance to try the newest retinal implant .
Which does bring up an important issue about this entire line of research .
Artificial retinas require surgery .
As we discussed with the MIT implant , there are ways of minimizing the risks associated with such surgeries , but they ca n’t be brought to zero .
Placing a thin film electrode array on the retina has some chance of causing it further damage .
There are non-surgical solutions to producing a retinal implant , we ’ve even seen a device that places the electrode array on the tongue !
Still , for those wishing to replicate human vision , a device permanently embedded in the eye would seem like the ultimate solution .
Looking at the improvement in resolution ( 16 pixels to 60 to 200 + ) it ’s hard not to hope for a geometric trend .
At this rate , Argus IV may reach the DOE ’s 1000 pixel goal , and Argus V could vastly exceed it .
However , I would rather be cautiously optimistic than wildly hopeful .
The Argus project is a remarkable scientific endeavor and I am really encouraged by the steady work done at LLNL and partnered facilities .
Still it ’s relatively early in the development of the prosthesis and it could be many more years before such technology is widely available to the general public .
But you know , looking at that implant , knowing the exponential growth of processing speed and transistor technology , I ca n’t help but think that we ’re just a few short steps from cybernetically enhanced vision .
How many decades ( if that long ) before we have to choose between keeping our natural eyes and opting for superior machine vision ?
It ’s just an epic promise of technology at this point … but some of those promises could be fulfilled .
One step at a time .
The majority of victims knew their attacker , the research suggests
One in seven female students has been the victim of a serious sexual or physical assault , a study suggests .
But few women report attacks to the police , according to a poll of more than 2,000 female students in the UK .
More than four in 10 said they thought they would be blamed , the study on behalf of the National Union of Students ( NUS ) found .
It said not enough was being done to get students to report incidents to their institutions or the police .
A total of 14 % of those polled in the online survey said they had been the victim of either a serious sexual assault or serious physical violence or both .
It is vital that universities create an environment where women feel confident to speak out against abuse
Sandra Horley , Refuge
One in four women ( 25 % ) said they had been subjected to an unwanted sexual experience while at university or college .
Some 7 % said they had been seriously sexually assaulted - 5 % said they had been raped while 2 % were the victim of attempted rape .
A total of 11 % said they had been subjected to a serious physical assault .
Only 4 % of female students who were sexually assaulted reported it to the university and only one in 10 reported it to the police , according to the poll .
Half of those surveyed said they felt ashamed or embarrassed while 43 % said they thought they would be blamed if they went to the police .
Attacks ' by students '
In the majority of cases in which a student had been attacked , assaulted or stalked , the victim knew the offender , it found .
NUS women 's officer Olivia Bailey said the report was a " wake - up call " .
She said : " It is extremely disturbing that so many women students are assaulted and harassed while at university or college , and it is particularly worrying that the perpetrators in many of these cases are fellow students . "
She called on universities and colleges to work with police , victim support and health services to give victims the confidence to come forward .
Sandra Horley , chief executive of the charity Refuge , said she was " deeply saddened " to hear so many women were experiencing violence or harassment during their studies .
" It is vital that universities create an environment where women feel confident to speak out against abuse .
" Women students need to know where they can seek help , and must feel sure that their reports will be taken seriously .
" Women have the right to enjoy university life , focus on their studies and plan for their futures , without fear of intimidation of violence . "
The survey questioned 2,058 current female students between August 2009 and March 2010 .

The withdrawal of a popular painkiller from the market in the United Kingdom has led to a dramatic decrease in the number of suicides and accidental overdoses in that country , according to a study conducted by researchers from Oxford University 's Centre for Suicide Research and published in the The drug in question is a combination of the narcotic painkiller dextropropoxyphene ( in the opioid family ) with the over - the - counter painkiller acetaminophen , also known as paracetamol or Tylenol .
In the United Kingdom , the drug was marketed as co-proxamol , but it is also known as Darvon with APAP , Capadex , Di-Antalvic , Di-Gesic and Lentogesic .
In 2005 , the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) decided to remove co-proxamol from the market after statistics emerged suggesting that the drug was particularly dangerous , causing between 300 and 400 self - poisoning deaths every year .
Approximately 80 percent of these deaths were intentional suicides .
The agency instructed doctors to phase out use of the drug by 2007 , and over that period prescriptions of co-proxamol fell 59 percent and deaths from the drug fell 62 percent .
This translated into 295 fewer suicides and 54 fewer accidental overdoses from the drug .
Significantly , there was no concurrent increase in suicides or accidental overdoses from other painkillers , even though use of those drugs increased correspondingly .
" This marked reduction in suicides and accidental poisonings involving co-proxamol during this period , with no evidence of an increase in deaths involving other analgesics , suggests the initiative has been effective , " lead researcher Keith Hawton said .
" Co-proxamol is extremely dangerous in overdose -- only a small overdose can be fatal , and death can occur very rapidly -- before medical attention can be sought , " an MHRA spokesperson said .
" [ In addition , ] there is no robust evidence that co-proxamol offers any advantage over paracetamol or ibuprofen at normal doses .
" The FDA is currently considering whether to withdraw the drug from the U.S. market .

According to new data , it would appear that people tend to be fair and trusting in strangers for reasons that are different than the initially - suspected ones .
In previous studies , it has been proposed that individuals tend to trust people they 've just met on account of the fact that they unconsciously transferred feelings of kinship to them .
The previous work established that , as society grew , this habit evolved to the point it reached today .
But the new work proposes that existing market places and the major religions play a much larger role in this phenomenon than they are credited for .
The paper also seems to suggest that deviant individuals – including thieves , pick - pockets and shoplifters – are not the norm , but the exception to the rule .
For millions of years , our ancestors have lived in foraging groups made up of only a few individuals , most likely an extended family .
It was therefore natural for everyone to know everyone , and contacts were easily established .
With the emergence of the world 's major religions , each of them promoting love for other people , these interactions were placed inside a new framework , which facilitated their development .
In other words , changes in the way societies were set up promoted a pro-social type of behavior , which eventually developed into our propensity for entertaining in conversations with strangers .
“ Measures of fairness toward anonymous others , in terms of motivations and beliefs , vary dramatically across human societies .
And we can explain most of the variation between groups by the degree of market incorporation and the presence of a world religion , ” says University of British Columbia ( UBC ) anthropologist Joseph Henrich , who was also the author of the new study .
The work analyzed some 2,000 participants , pertaining to 15 different types of societies around the world .
“ One of the things that might have occurred through cultural evolution to help build these larger groups , is the evolution of religious systems with supernatural agents that were in some sense police , concerned about those elements of behavior that would facilitate exchange and trade and harmonious groups , allowing groups to get larger and larger , ” the author says .
Details of the work appear in the March 19 issue of the respected publications Science , LiveScience reports .

Understanding the RDP
This section will introduce ( or re-familiarize ) you with the PADI Recreation Dive Planner ( RDP ) .
The dive table is used to gauge how much excess nitrogen you have in your body , so you can determine your maximum safe time and depth limits .
The RDP has three parts , Tables 1 , 2 and 3 .
Table 1 tells you the maximum amount of time you can stay at a certain depth on your first dive , and it tells you how much nitrogen you have in your body after a dive ( letters A through Z , Z meaning you have plenty of it , A very little ) .
To use the dive table , on your first dive , determine your depth .
Anything under 35 feet is considered 35 , and anything above 35 should be rounded UP to the nearest 10th , ie : 46 feet would round UP to the 50 foot column .
Go down the selected depth column until you find your bottom time ( again , rounding up ) , ie : if you dived for 38 minutes , under the 50 foot column , you would end up an ' L ' diver .
Note , that since there was no 38 minute row , we had to round up to the next ( 39 minutes ) .
Looking to the right on the bottom time row , you get your end of dive designation .
In this case , an ' L ' .
The letter ' L ' means you have a quantity of nitrogen in your system .
Turn the table over , and note on table 3 , on the L column how much residual nitrogen you have at the different depths .
Okay , back to the front of the table .
Table 2 ( on right ) is concerned with the surface interval time ( SIT ) .
It determines the time it takes to move from letter to letter .
For example , if you were an L diver ( as in the example above ) , and waited 1 hour ( move right on the L line until you get to the column within your SIT ) , you would be a C diver .
Now , knowing your ending designation , you can determine your safe diving limits on the next dive .
As an example , we plan the second dive to 40 feet and 40 minutes .
On table 3 , going down the C column until we find the 40 foot row , we can see our maximum safe bottom time ( in blue ) for 40 feet is 118 , so we know we safely dive our 40 minutes .
We still need to determine our ending letter designation , like the first dive , but now we have to add the residual nitrogen to our minutes .
This number is in the white part of the 40 foot row on table 3 .
In this example the residual nitrogen is 22 . 22 added to 40 is 62 .
Returning to table 1 , we compute our ending designation on the 40 foot column , moving down to the 62 minute row ( rounding up to 64 ) .
We are now an O diver .
Repeat the above steps for subsequent dives .
It is recommended that you draw a diagram ( Figure 1 ) , just like the one below to record , compute , and to determine you dive profile .
Figure 1
Example # 1
Finding your ending dive letter designations
Now we will work a 3 dive profile together ( Figure 2 ) .
The first is to 70 feet for 30 minutes , then a surface interval ( SIT ) of 1 hour and 10 minutes , then a dive to 60 feet for 35 minutes , then a surface interval of 1 hour and 35 minutes , then a final dive to 50 feet for 40 minutes .
Figure 2
Referring to Figure 3 , to finish we have to find out our ending dive , letter designations ( in blue ) , whether a safety stop is required ( the brown dots ) , and the residual and total bottom times ( in pink )
Figure 3
With the RDP in hand , go to the 70 foot column and work your way down to 30 minutes .
You have to round up to the 31 minute row which corresponds to a letter designation of ' O ' .
Since this was the first dive , there was no residual nitrogen factors to consider , and a safety stop was not required since we did not end our dive in the gray or black ( near the no decompression limits - NDL ) .
Move right on the ' O ' line until you reach a column that includes 1 hour and 10 minutes .
It is the ' D ' column .
1 hour and 10 minutes falls between the 1 hour and 4 minutes and 1 hour and 12 minutes .
Now follow the ' D ' column down and over to the next side ( table 3 ) , then continue down the ' D ' column until you get to the 60 foot row .
There are 2 numbers here , one in white , one in blue .
The blue number is the maximum allowed bottom time you could stay down at this depth and letter designation , but we need the white number because it is our residual nitrogen time ( RNT ) .
The RNT is 16 and added to the actual bottom time ( ABT ) of 35 gives us a total bottom time ( TBT ) of 51 minutes .
Turning the table back to the front , we can now compute our ending dive letter designation by going down the 60 foot column until we get to the 51 minute row ( rounding up to 52 ) , which is the letter ' U ' .
Note that we ended our dive in the gray area of the table .
That means we are required to make a 3 minute safety stop .
Computing the last dive is done just like our dive 2 .
After waiting on a SIT of 1 hour and 35 minutes , our ending dive letter designation is a ' C ' .
On table 3 we find the RNT of 17 on the 50 foot row , and adding that to the ABT we get a TBT of 57 minutes .
On the front of the RDP , table 1 , going down the 50 foot column until we get to the 57 minute row , we end up with a letter designation of ' R ' , and no required safety stop .
That completes this dive profile .
The only other total you might want to compute is the total bottom time .
The total bottom time is the sum of the ACTUAL bottom times , including required safety stops , ie : 30+35+3+40=108 minutes .
Figure 4
Example # 2
Finding safe bottom times
Draw the dive profile diagram like Figure 1 , and fill the following , given data :
First dive to 90 feet , surface interval of 30 minutes , then a dive to 80 feet .
What is a safe bottom time for the 1st and 2nd dive that does NOT required a safety stop after the first dive ?
With the given information we can create a profile like the following Figure 5 :
Figure 5
Using Table 1 on the RDP , we simply run down the 90 foot column until we get to the gray area and we find that we can dive without a safety stop for 21 minutes and we end up with a letter designation of ' M '. Using Table 2 , after 30 minutes we are a ' H '. Turning to the back , Table 3 , we go down the ' H ' column until we get to the blue number on the 80 foot row .
That number is 13 minutes ( see Figure 6 )
Figure 6
Example # 3
Exceeding the no decompression limit
First dive to 80 feet for 20 minutes , surface interval for 1 hour , then 70 feet for 29 minutes , then you determine the surface interval before the 3rd dive to 33 feet for 15 minutes ( Figure 7 ) .
This is a tricky problem and the right answer would be that it was unsafe , but do the profile using the Emergency Decompression rules on the back of the RDP .
Figure 7
Using the front of the RDP , Table 1 you find you are a ' K ' diver by moving down the 80 foot column until you get to the 21 minute row ( rounding up ) and the ending dive designation of ' K ' .
After 1 hour , moving right on the ' K ' line , using Table 2 , you stop at column ' C ' , 1 hour .
Moving to the back of the RDP , Table 3 , and down the ' C ' column until you get to the 70 foot row , you find the RNT is 12 minutes .
You also note a maximum bottom time of 28 ( the number in blue ) .
This means that this dive was unsafe , but we are going to continue the profile .
You were certainly not plan a dive like this .
On Table 1 , you run down the 70 foot column until you get to 41 minutes and find it exceeds the no decompression limit by 1 minute .
Reading the special circumstances rules on the back of the RDP , we find we must do a safety stop for 8 minutes , and a required surface interval of 6 hours before diving again ( Figure 8 ) .
Figure 8
Example # 4
Finding your minimum surface interval
Your dive plans include a 120 foot dive for 12 minutes , then a 90 foot dive for 18 minutes , then end the day with a 60 foot dive for 41 minutes ( Figure 9 ) .
Figure 9
Running down the 120 foot column , on Table 1 , you stop at 12 minutes and ending letter ' J ' row .
Since you are in the gray area , you are required to do a 3 minute safety stop .
Looking on the back of the RDP , Table 3 , you move right on the 90 foot row until you find a column where it is safe to dive for 18 minutes ( in blue ) and find it in column ' B ' .
Moving back to the front of the RDP , Table 2 , you move right across the ' J ' row until you get to the ' B ' column .
The top number there , 1 hour and 12 minutes is the minimum surface interval .
Back to Table 3 on the RDP , the ' B ' column and 90 foot row , you find the RNT is 7 minutes .
This added to the actual bottom time of 18 minutes gives you a total bottom time of 25 minutes at 90 foot .
Running down the 90 foot column on Table 1 , to the 25 minutes row , you find your ending dive letter as ' Q ' .
Now , like between dives 1 and 2 , you move to the back of the RDP , Table 3 , and move right , across the 60 foot column until you find a column where the blue number is greater than or equal to 41 minutes .
You find this column to be ' C ' .
Back on the front of the RDP , on Table 2 , move right across the ' Q ' line until you get to the ' C ' line and you find the minimum SIT to be 1 hour and 21 minutes .
Figure 10

Below is a table marking the stats of the " average player " for each Major League Baseball season since 1876 .
The statistics were determined as follows :1 ) Use league AVG , OBP , SLG and OBP;2 )
Find average rate of other cumulative stats by dividing total stat by total plate appearances ;3 )
Find the average player 's plate appearances ( details below ) ; 4 ) Find average player 's stats by applying rate as determined in # 2 to plate appearances in # 3 .
The average player 's plate appearances are found by :1 ) Multiply number of offensive players in a starting lineup by number of teams to get total starting offensive positions ( for example , ( 8 X 16 ) + ( 9 X 14 ) for 2009 ( this is the total number of starting offensive positions that season -- we 'll call it ) ; 2 ) Sincerefers to the total number of starting offensive positions , we 'll want to find the average plate appearances for the topplayers .
Back to the example in 2009 , there were a total of 254 starting positions .
We would then list the top 254 players in plate appearances for that season and find the average of that number .
Once we apply the league average rate for cumulative stats to this number , we will get a much more realistic number for what to expect from the average player during that season .
DETROIT --
The San Jose Sharks and Chicago Blackhawks were the class of the Western Conference most of the season , separating themselves from the pack .
After his team 's 1 - 0 shootout victory at Nashville on Saturday , Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock revisited that notion , posing the question , " Who 's the best team in the West ? ' '
That no longer is an easy question to answer .
The standings say the Sharks and Blackhawks still are the top teams in the conference .
The Red Wings ' recent play suggests they should be in the conversation .
" I think Chicago 's probably been the best team in the West , San Jose maybe , '' Babcock said .
" Who knows who the best team in the West is ?
That 's what I 'm trying to say .
" I do n't know if you interview 10 people if they 'd all give you the same three .
That 's how tight the league is now .
With our experience , if you can get into the tournament , we feel we have a chance . ''
Barring a collapse , Detroit will make the playoffs , possibly as the fifth seed in the West .
The Red Wings have won a season - high five consecutive games and are 12 - 2 - 1 in their past 15 .
They trail the Predators by one point but have a game in hand and a favorable schedule ( four of their remaining seven games are against non-playoff teams Columbus and Edmonton ) .
As inconceivable as it seemed a month ago , if the Red Wings gain nine of a possible 14 points , they will finish with their 10th consecutive 100 - point season .
" Buffalo's had a heck of a year , they 're at ( 92 ) points ; New Jersey 's had a great year ( with 93 points before Sunday ) , '' Babcock said .
" We 're at ( 91 ) and think we 've been no good .
" So a little perspective . ''
Nashville coach Barry Trotz said he never doubted the Red Wings would make the playoffs , even when they were riddled by injuries .
" They got exceptional players , '' Trotz said .
" You go down the list , that 's not a poor team .
That 's not an eighth - place team , that 's a team that has a lot more . ''
Others in the West surely would agree .
The Red Wings , even with a depleted roster for most of the season , have assembled a 14 - 4 - 4 record against the five teams ahead of them : San Jose ( 3 - 0 - 1 ) , Chicago ( 2 - 2 - 1 ) , Vancouver ( 3 - 1 - 0 ) , Phoenix ( 2 - 0 - 2 ) and Nashville ( 4 - 1 -0 )
" I look at the West , I do n't know who 's going to be the favorite , because there 's not going to be much ( difference ) from 1 to 8 , '' Trotz said .
Babcock lauds Howards
After watching Jimmy Howard stop all 33 shots he faced in regulation and overtime and then turn aside 10 - of - 11 shootout attempts to earn his second career shutout , Babcock said , " I think this is as good a goaltending we 've had since I 've been here . ''
Babcock said he would not be concerned about Howard 's lack of experience in the playoffs .
" He 's a guy who 's done a good job for us , gotten us to the point we 're at , '' Babcock said .
" The test of time is what he 's got to survive .
" To me he 's showing real good signs .
He 's given our team confidence .
He looks like a real goalie to me .
I 'm real comfortable ( using Howard in the playoffs ) . ''
Odds & ends
The 22 shots needed to decide the shootout equaled an NHL season - high .
... The Red Wings improved to 5 - 9 in shootouts this season .
... Defenseman Niklas Kronwall scored what proved to be the winning goal on his first career shootout attempt .
... Center Darren
Helm was the only forward Babcock did not use in the shootout .
... Patrick Eaves stumbled and fell during his attempt , failing to get a shot off .
He laughed about it .
A large scale study of children between the ages of 2 to 19 finds that a growing number of young children are extremely obese — or have a body mass index greater than 35 kg / m .
According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , children who are in the 85th up to 95th percentile ( or have a BMI higher than 25 kg/ m , and greater than 85 – 94 % of their same - age peers ) are categorized as overweight .
Children whose BMI is equal to or greater than the 95th percentile , or higher than 30 kg/m , are categorized as obese .
And children whose BMI is higher than 99 % of their peers are categorized as extremely obese , according to Dr. Amy Porter , a pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente and co-author of the study published online today in the Journal of Pediatrics .
The study included 710,949 children , who had an average of 2.6 doctor ’s visits per year between 2006 –2007 , during which height and weight were measured .
Analyzing that data , researchers found that 7.3 % of boys and 5.5 % of girls were extremely obese , a figure that suggests as many as 45,000 children between the ages of 2 to 19 are extremely obese across the U.S .
As with previous study into childhood obesity , this latest study , conducted by Porter and colleagues at Kaiser Permanente Southern California ’s Department of Research and Evaluation , found ethnic discrepancies in obesity rates among children .
While black teenage girls and Hispanic boys included in the study were the most likely to be extremely obese — with 12 % and 11.2 % respectively meeting the clinical criteria for extreme obesity — white , Asian and Pacific Islander children were the least likely to be extremely obese , researchers found .
This latest research adds to a growing movement to begin obesity prevention efforts among younger children by , among other things , educating parents and disrupting cultural norms that may set minority children up for a greater risk for obesity .
Finding a way to overcome childhood obesity — and reduce the associated increase in risk for diabetes , heart disease and other health ailments — is becoming an increasingly urgent public health issue , as Michelle Obama ’s recent Let ’s Move campaign underscores , and distinguishing between the battle against obesity and discrimination against overweight children is going to be a central issue in any successful efforts , Porter emphasizes .
In a video discussion of the study findings ( below ) , Porter stresses the point : “ Extremely obese children can be anything they want .
But what you ca n’t be , if you ’re extremely obese , is healthy . ”

Videos of the 3D Engine on the Google Android Nexus One Uberphone
The new 3D features are demoed with the upcoming Google Earth app for Android .
These 3D features will surely bring along many 3D graphics applications and even games ( Androlib free ) – much like on the iPhone .
Google also has teamed up with Cooliris to bring the 3D experiences to the Android Nexus One user .
Now watch these videos and comment in our comment area
3D Engine on Google Android Phone – Nexus One
Even complex 3D engines seem to run fine on flash 10.1
Flash Player 10.1 , 3D content on Google Nexus One
After you have watched these videos , do you still think flash is too CPU intensive and is slowing down mobile phones ?
In a blink of the eye , a lot can happen .
A lot of astonishing things happen in a split of a second , but they are moving too quickly for us to see .
High - speed photography is the art of photographing a rapidly occurring event .
Depending on the event to be photographed , methods range from the use of ultra-short time flash exposures to producing lots of exposures in a split - second .
Seemingly frozen in time , a lot of photographers have their particular method of doing high - speed photography .
The usual photographic flash component offers a flash that lasts around a thousandth of a second ( a millisecond ) .
But the photographic flash component used in high - speed photography is so much quicker than this , and it creates a flash of light around a microsecond ( a millionth of a second ) .
This lets you freeze time through pictures that are happening tremendously fast .
It ’s not easy to come up with a perfect shot while capturing a rapidly occurring event ; photographers that specialize in this type of photography are masters of patience .
Below are some incredibly fresh images that show the beautiful combination of artistic expression and technical precision .

Mr. Adelson told the crowd that the site was " five years in the making . "
While the company did n't reveal much about the new website , it seems that there will be a cleaner interface , more personalization options , the ability to submit news items with one click , and a leaderboard for top users .
Digg 's famous website buttons are also getting revamped .
In fact , if you Digg an article on Mashable , you will see the new buttons in action , as we are currently helping test them .
We 're going to try to put up a video of the announcement , along with more details on the new version of Digg as soon as we can .
In the meantime , I 've put up screenshots from New .
Digg.com and enhanced the brightness to make viewing the new interface easier .
Update : Digg 's Steve French left some more interesting information in the Digg comment thread for this post .
Here it is in its entirety :
" Top to bottom , the entire company has been in overdrive for this project .
There are amazing things coming , and I 'm glad the screen shots and presentation did n't spill everything we have in the works for you guys .
My favorite new feature ... it 's * blazing * fast .
There has been a lot of effort that 's gone into the architecture and monitoring of performance . "

The United States Secretary of Education and the founder of a non-profit organization will speak at the spring commencement ceremonies , University of Wisconsin officials announced Wednesday .
U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Youth Speaks founder James Kass were chosen among other potential speakers , Secretary of the Faculty David Musolf said .
According to a UW press release , Duncan will speak at a Saturday ceremony and Kass will speak at the remaining ceremonies Saturday and Sunday .
“ It ’s always nice to have people that there ’s name recognition , and certainly there ’s broad recognition for Arne Duncan , ” Musolf said .
He added he is also excited for Kass , saying he thinks Youth Speaks seems like a very exciting and engaging organization .
Associated Students of Madison Secretary Kurt Gosselin , who was a member of the committee selecting the officers , said they were hoping they would be able to get a speaker high up in President Barack Obama ’s administration .
Gosselin said Chancellor Biddy Martin helped the officers by drafting a letter to the Obama administration , asking them to send a speaker for commencement .
He said he was very excited by their acquiescence .
“ I think it ’s great that the Secretary of Education ’s coming to speak here , ” Gosselin said .
“ That the Obama administration was willing to … dispatch him to come speak is indicative of the fact that we are sort of ‘ on the map ’ so to speak in terms of our quality of education . ”
Kass , a UW graduate , said he is very excited to be coming back for commencement .
“ I ’m completely honored ; I ’m a huge fan of the UW , ” Kass said .
“ I absolutely said ‘ yes ’ right away . ”
Gosselin said though he thinks Kass is also a very impressive speaker as one of the first recipients of the UW Forward Under 40 award , he recognized some students graduating on Sunday may still want to hear Duncan speak as well .
He said the senior class officers are working with Martin and Dean of Students Lori Berquam to find a way for those students and their guests to see Duncan speak .
Musolf added UW sometimes has to have two speakers to accommodate the large amount of ceremonies .
He said he did not think it is a problem that one is more broadly recognized .
“ I think what matters is the content of the speech , ” he said .
UW senior Maren Maland , who will graduate on Sunday , said even though Kass is not as broadly recognized as Duncan , she is still excited to hear Kass speak .
Maland said she is familiar with Youth Speaks and wants to go into non-profit work after graduation .
Maland added , however , she thinks it is unfortunate she may not get to hear what Duncan has to say to the graduates .
“ It ’s a little disappointing because I would have liked to have heard what he had to say , ” Maland said .
” I ’m excited for [ Kass ] as well , but I would have loved to have heard [ Duncan ] . ”
The number of millionaires in the US jumped by 16 per cent last year after slumping by 27 per cent in 2008 , a report shows .
Last year , about 7.8 million US households had a million dollars or more in investable assets - not counting capital invested in their primary residence , the report released on Tuesday by the Spectrem Group shows .
That was up by 1.1 million from the year before , when the number of US millionaires fell to its lowest point since 2003 , hitting 6.7 million as the US economy stumbled .
" While still well short of its all - time high of 9.2 million in 2007 , this year 's growth in the millionaire population is nevertheless welcome news for an economy still working to recover , " said George Walper , the group 's president .
The number of quintuple - millionaire households - with assets worth more than $ US 5 million ( $ 5.49 million ) - was also up last year , climbing by 17 per cent to 980,000 from 840,000 in 2008 .

Adam is the mild - mannered Prince of Eternia .
Unbeknownst to many around him , when he holds aloft his magic sword and speaks the magic words , he and his pet Cringer are transformed into Battlecat and He -Man , the most powerful man in the universe !
He leads a fearless group , sworn to protect the realm and secrets of Castle Greyskull .
Along with Man-at - Arms , Teela , and the Sorceress , he defends against the evil onslaught of Skeletor and his army .
While Skeletors magic sword was formed of the same mold as He -Mans , it is the pure heart of the wielder which makes him the more powerful , something evildoers learned every weekday for three years !
The show also spun off into a cartoon called She - Ra : Princess of Power , intended to draw little girls into the realm of Eternia , but didnt do quite so well for obvious reasons .
Other heroes included Orko , Stratos , Mekaneck , Ram Man , Fisto , and Zodiak
Other Villains included Beast Man , Trap Jaw , Mer Man , Evil Lynn , and Hordak
He -Man actually had his beginnings in Hollywood .
What was originally to be a Conan The Barbarian cartoon & toy line after the 1982 Arnold Schwarzenegger film was eventually deemed to be too violent and sexual for children back in the day , so it was re-packaged as He - Man in 1983 .
salutation in parting , also goodbye , good bye , good - by , 1590s , from godbwye ( 1570s ) , a contraction of God be with ye ( late 14 c. ) , influenced by good - day , good evening , etc .
As a noun from 1570s .
Intermediate forms in 16 c. include
God be wy you , God b'uy , God buoye , God buy , etc .
RIO DE JANEIRO —
She is the Shirley Temple of samba , a 7 - year - old named to a coveted Carnival role normally reserved for barely clad models who have undergone more plastic surgeries than little Julia Lira has seen birthdays .
Naming the girl drum corps queen for the Viradouro samba group is raising eyebrows even in a city that has seen everything during the annual mega - party that begins next week .
A judge is considering blocking Julia ’s participation .
A state agency that defends children ’s rights says she ’s too young to take on a traditionally sexy role .
But the girl ’s father , who happens to be the president of the Viradouro group , says Julia is a natural who can easily samba through the 80 - minute parade route in Rio ’s sweltering summer heat .
“ Any man who looks at a 7 - year - old child and feels any sort of excitement should go see a doctor , ” Marco Lira said before rehearsal this week .
“ She has the aptitude to be a drum corps queen — you ’ll see it tonight .
She has a seriousness inside of her when she is on the stage . ”
At the delicate core of Julia ’s case is the queen ’s traditional role in Rio ’s Carnival : that of sexy muse .
Unlike other participants , she is usually not bare - chested and wears more than just glitter .
But queen costumes would be considered revealing by any estimation .
Brazil has long had a problem with sexual exploitation of children , especially in the lawless Amazon region .
Allowing Julia to be a drum corps queen “ would increase the treatment of children as sexual objects in Brazilian society , ” said Carlos Nicodemos , director of the Rio de Janeiro state Council for the Defense of Children and Adolescents .
“ We ’re not against kids participating in Carnival ; it ’s part of Brazilian culture , ” Nicodemos said .
“ What we ca n’t allow is putting a 7 - year - old girl in a role that traditionally for Carnival has a very sexual focus . ”
The competition among the 12 top - tier samba groups is fierce , and the winners are hailed by fans across Brazil .
Viradouro , which won the title in 1997 , is no stranger to controversy .
In 2008 , a judge blocked the group ’s use of a dancer dressed as Hitler on a float loaded with naked people representing Holocaust victims after the display caused an international outcry .
Julia ’s fate is now in the hands of a family court in Rio .
The judge examining the case , Ivone Ferreira Caetano , has declined to comment or say when she will make a decision .
Marco Lira said the judge requested information about the girl ’s role , what time the group was scheduled to makes its presentation — now slated for just after midnight on Feb. 14 — and what Julia would be wearing .
At practice this week , Julia danced in a poofy , white miniskirt , sequined halter top and silver - heeled sandals , a tiara atop her head .
While the details of parade themes and costumes are closely guarded secrets in Rio ’s Carnival , a Viradouro artistic director said Julia ’s outfit would be suitable for a child .
“ We ’re taking the necessary precautions because she is n’t going to be a muse , ” Edson Pereira said on the group ’s Web site .
“ We ca n’t transform a girl into a woman , much less explore any sensuality . ”
Just before Tuesday ’s rehearsal , Julia was roughhousing with two other girls inside her dad ’s office .
She stopped playing only when her mother , Monica , told her it was time to get dressed for practice .
A gregarious girl with a toothy grin , she declined to say much , despite the coaxing of her parents and samba instructor .
She did n’t like how her mother had fixed her hair and was in no mood to talk to a reporter .
Asked why she wanted to be the drum corps queen , Julia would only say quietly : “ I ’m happy because I like to dance . ”
That much is clear .
When she took the stage in front of more than 1,000 people at the rehearsal , she lit up as she presented a bouquet of roses to 30 - year - old Juliana Paes , a top Brazilian actress who served as Viradouro ’s drum queen for five years .
Once the beats from the drum corps erupted , Julia dove into her samba routine .
Beyond the question of appropriateness is whether a 4 - foot - tall ( 1.2 - meter ) girl weighing about 55 pounds ( 25 kilograms ) can physically withstand the dancing during Viradouro ’s parade .
At the rehearsal , she was handed cups of water within 10 minutes of taking the stage and in 20 minutes started to look tired .
Her father emphasized that several people would be watching after her during the parade , that she would be able to rest and that every precaution would be taken to safeguard her health .
Regardless , some Carnival fans do n’t see how Julia could be considered for the role .
“ She is way too young to be parading down the avenue , ” said Jaquelene Oliveira , a 19 - year - old college student .
“ The role of the drum corps queen is to inspire the drummers to play hard for 80 minutes .
It is an innately sexual role and to put a child in that position is wrong . ”
This past week , I wrote a short blog entry about the international atheist convention to be held in my homeland , Australia , this year , and commented that atheism is ultimately a meaningless philosophy .
Well — that hit a touchy spot with many atheists , many of whom went ballistic on their blogs over my statements .
So let ’s just consider the down - to - earth practicalities of an atheist philosophy .
If one is an atheist , and does not believe in the supernatural , and believes ( and yes , it is all belief — blind - faith belief ) that the universe and life can be accounted for by natural processes ( this is what is now by and large taught in the public education system to millions of students , where Christianity was thrown out and replaced with the religion of naturalism ( atheism ) ) — then what happens when this atheist dies ?
Well — from his or her perspective , they cease to exist and wo n’t know they knew anything — they wo n’t ever be conscious that there was anything , is anything , or will be anything — they cease to think .
Total non-existence !
Then from this atheistic perspective , those who knew them when they were alive , when they die , they wo n’t know each other existed and it will be total non-existence for all of them .
Most of them believe that eventually the whole universe will die a heat death , so ultimately there will be non-existence for all .
So , what is the point of anything one does now anyway , when there will be a time ( from their perspective ) when no consciousness will exist to even know anything or remember anything ?
It will all be nothingness .
Atheists may subjectively claim they make their own meaning and purpose right now — but so what !
And it is just their opinion anyway !
They may claim ( as some have ) that we should follow the “ golden rule ” — but why ?
And even if some agree with this concept , that is just their subjective opinion — why should n’t others have different “ rules ’ ?
After all , there is no absolute authority , so everyone is free to make up their own rules if they want — and if they can get away with it .
Just as it states in the book of Judges 21:25 : “ In those days there was no king in Israel ; everyone did what was right in his own eyes . ”
If an atheist was consistent ( and they are not — they have to be inconsistent with their own philosophy to live in this world and to even claim purpose and meaning ) , why bother trying to force their views on others ?
Why get upset with Christians / creationists ?
What ’s the point ?
Why bother — ultimately no one alive today will know they ever existed — so why bother ?
Why bother trying to help people in earthquake - devastated Haiti , for example ?
Yes , I totally agree with helping such people ( my biblical worldview based on a absolute authority , the Bible — not just opinion — dictates that : love your neighbor , help people in need , help the poor , etc. ) — but why should an atheist ?
They can say it is important , or that we need to help our fellow man — but from a consistent atheistic philosophy — WHY ?
We are just matter — just molecules , and our consciousness one day will cease to exist ( from their perspective ) .
Ultimately all people will cease to exist , so what ’s the point of doing anything — including people meeting in Australia to discuss something they do n’t believe in ?
They may say it is important they have quality of life while alive — but ultimately they will cease to exist and wo n’t know they were ever alive anyway , so why does it ultimately matter ?
Why ?
They can answer with whatever subjective opinions they want — but ultimately , WHY does it matter ?
Only Christianity and the fact that there is an absolute authority explain the purpose and meaning of this world — and gives the basis for right and wrong , good and evil , etc .
Ultimately , these atheists are shaking their fist against God .
They refuse to be accountable to anyone .
They do n’t want to recognize their sinful nature , and that they are in rebellion against God .
And they do n’t want to acknowledge they are in need of salvation .
Essentially , they want to be their own “ gods . ”
And this is exactly what happened in Genesis 3 where Satan came to Adam and Eve and tempted them with “ you can be as gods . ”
In other words , do n’t obey God — you become your own god .
That is humankind ’s basic problem — people want to be their own god and continue to rebel against the true God .
Answers in Genesis is an organization dedicated to taking the message of salvation to all ( including these atheists ) — and to declaring that God Himself stepped into history to pay the penalty for our sin so our relationship with our Creator can be restored and we will live with our Creator for eternity .
That is the true purpose and meaning of life .
And as the Bible reminds us in Romans 1 , we are all “ without excuse . ”
These atheists are “ without excuse . ”
And for all their ravings and rantings and name calling ( which is how they usually respond against blogs like this ) , they will stand before God one day — and they will exist for eternity , but so so sadly , separated from God , unless they repent and receive the free gift of salvation .
One day , all will be brought to light .
Death has a way of “ leveling the playing field . ”
By the way , to really understand logic and the right way to think — and how to argue with a non-Christian , I encourage you to obtain Ultimate Proof by Dr. Jason Lisle of our staff , and also the DVD set Ultimate Apologetics that presents the material in his book .
You can obtain both these items from the AiG online bookstore .
Birds on the Brain !
Greg West is a friend of the Creation Museum who lives in our area .
Greg has a great collection of pigeons .
Last week , he showed off some of his pigeon breeds with staff members and also gave a short talk .
Greg is developing a presentation called “ Birds of a Feather , ” which will use Bible verses related to birds and fascinating information about the amazing ability of pigeons ( e.g. , the incredible homing pigeon , the tumbling pigeon , etc. ) .
Can you believe that the two pigeons here in this photo are of the same “ Genesis kind ” made by God on Day 5 of the creation week ?
It just shows how much incredible diversity there must have been in the original two pigeons !
Greg ’s first workshop at the museum is scheduled for January 30 – 1:00 pm and 3 pm . See CreationMuseum.org/events /.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has released its draft news media bargaining code , announced today by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg .
The draft code allows commercial news businesses to bargain – individually or collectively – with Google and Facebook , in order to be paid for news the tech giants publish on their services .
According to ACCC chair Rod Sims , the code aims to address the bargaining power imbalance between news publishers and major digital platforms , to bring about fair payment for news .
As Frydenberg said :
We want Google and Facebook to continue to provide these services to the Australian community which are so much loved and used by Australians .
But we want it to be on our terms .
The ACCC has previously found Google and Facebook ’s failure to pay for news content is eating into the advertising revenues which fund journalism .
But what ’s ‘ news ’ ?
The code is set out as exposure draft legislation and an explanatory memorandum .
These set out the rules for who can bargain .
To be eligible , a news business must have employed journalists , earn more than A$ 150,000 per year in revenue and be registered with the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) .
And they must provide “ core news ” , defined as :
journalism on publicly significant issues , journalism that engages Australians in public debate and informs democratic decision making , and journalism relating to community and local events .
How will bargains be struck ?
The code does not specify how much news businesses should be paid .
Instead , it provides a negotiating process in which Google and Facebook must take part .
The negotiating phase lasts three months and includes at least one day of mediation .
If there is no agreement at the end , the process moves to compulsory arbitration ( by an ACMA appointed panel ) which both parties pay for .
The arbitration panel will then select one of the final offers in a process sometimes called “ baseball determination ” .
Their decision will be binding .
The range of Facebook services subject to arbitration include Facebook News Feed , Instagram and the Facebook News Tab .
The Google services are Google Search , Google News and Google Discover .
WhatsApp ( owned by Facebook ) and Youtube ( owned by Google ) are not included .
But if both parties agree , arbitration under the draft code could include other relevant digital platform services , too .
The ACCC will also be able to make submissions in the arbitration process ( which the arbitrator can decide to consider or not ) .
Under limited and unlikely circumstances , the arbitrator may adjust the more reasonable of the final two offers .
Algorithmic change notices
The draft code introduces a series of “ minimum standards ” for digital platforms to meet in their dealings with news businesses .
These include a requirement for Google and Facebook to give 28 days ’ notice of any algorithmic change that will affect either referral traffic to news or the ranking of news behind paywalls .
This gives news businesses the opportunity to adapt their business models to ensure their content retains its prominence .
More importantly , it means their negotiated revenue will not drop .
It may also help in decisions about what content stays behind paywalls .
The same notice period is required for substantial changes to the display and presentation of news and advertising directly associated with news .
There will be an obligation on Google and Facebook to give businesses clear information about the nature and availability of user data collected through users ’ interactions with the news .
This does not mean Google or Facebook must share the data itself — only that news businesses will be informed of what kind of data are being collected .
More moderation opportunities
There are also obligations on the tech giants to publish proposals which appropriately recognise the media business ’ original news on their platforms and to provide those businesses with flexible tools for user comment moderation .
In addition , Google and Facebook must allow news businesses to prevent their news from being included on any individual platform service .
For instance , they may choose for an article to appear on Google Search but not Google News .
News businesses will be able to moderate comments more easily .
This is important considering they can be sued for comments published on their posts via platforms such as Facebook .
ABC and SBS lose out
The ABC and SBS only benefit from the minimum standards imposed on digital platforms under the code .
They are excluded from the remuneration process .
The government said this is because advertising revenue is not the principal source of funding for public broadcasters .
Anti-discrimination provisions are expected to prevent Google and Facebook from prioritising publicly - funded news to take advantage of this .
Not a windfall , but still good news
The draft code wo n’t result in a A$ 600 million payday for news businesses , as Nine ’s chair proposed in May .
However , the negotiation and arbitration process does provide certainty of a positive commercial outcome for news providers relying on advertising .
There will also be more work required for Google and Facebook to give notice of algorithmic changes , which are managed in the United States .
This obligation will mean adjustments to both the tech giants ’ business models .
Google has already taken steps down this path by successfully negotiating revenue sharing with some Australian news businesses .
In effect , it has created a benchmark for its position in the new negotiation framework .
Meanwhile , Facebook has argued “ news does not drive significant long - term commercial value ” for it .
However , it said it was committed to following “ sensible regulatory frameworks for digital news ” .
Penalties for breach
A breach of the code by Facebook or Google could have a few potential outcomes .
The first is an infringement notice which has a penalty of A$ 133,200 for each breach .
If the ACCC takes one of the tech giants to court , the maximum penalty is the higher of A$ 10 million , 10 % of the digital platform ’s turnover in Australia in the past 12 months , or three times the benefit obtained by the tech giant as a result of the breach ( if this can be calculated ) .
The ACCC has previously had success against franchisers for breaches of the mandatory Franchising Code .
It will likely be just as vigilant in policing the news media bargaining code .
The draft code is open for public comment until the end of August .
The final version will likely be considered by parliament in September .

Since its introduction in 1995 Blue Moon Belgian
White has steadily grown in popularity , becoming one of the most popular Belgian style beers in America .
Despite its popularity the beer also has many detractors who are weary of its corporate ownership and misleading labels .
Many do n’t realize that although it says “ Blue Moon Brewing Company ” on the label , Blue Moon is actually made by Molson Coors , one of the biggest beer companies in the world .
Because of this there are many in the craft beer community who are apprehensive about the beer ’s popularity .
They see it as an attempt by corporate America to infiltrate the craft beer scene under false pretenses and steal the profits from small , independently owned breweries .
They fear that big beer corporations like Molson Coors might one day even be able to drive these small craft breweries out of business thanks to their size and strength from a business stand point , forever damaging the craft beer scene .
At the same time there are many who see the surprising popularity of Blue Moon as nothing but a good thing .
Thanks to the massive reach and distribution channels of Molson Coors , Blue Moon is available throughout the US and has introduced countless casual beer drinkers to a Belgian style beer who might otherwise have never tried anything but light lagers like Coors and Budweiser .
As a result many more are taking an interest in quality craft beer , helping the craft beer movement a great deal .
These folks argue that a beer should be judged on taste , not who brews it , and to do otherwise is nothing but petty snobbery .
Personally I have mixed feelings on the beer .
While I too am suspicious of a big corporation like Molson Coors , there is no question it has helped spark an interest in craft beer among many who previously could n’t have cared less .
When people new to craft beer ask me to recommend something for them the number one comment I hear is “ I like Blue Moon , what else should I drink ? ” I usually tell these folks to give other Belgian whites a try .
Hoegaarden is perhaps the second most popular in the US of this style .
While the Hoegaarden Brewery has been around since the 15th century , it ’s currently owned by Anheisher - Busch , which makes it similar to Blue Moon ’s current ownership status .
Hoegaarden ’s corporate ties are n’t as well known as the Coors / Blue Moon connection so it tends to elicit less of a reaction among craft beer enthusiasts .
There are however some great craft wits out there , including the Ommegang Witte , Allagash White and Blanche De Chambly from Unibroue .
What do you think of Blue Moon ?
Has it helped or hurt the craft beer movement ?

PITTSBURGH —
On a cold , wet afternoon not long ago , Aron Reznick sat in the lounge of a home for the elderly here , his silver hair neatly combed , his memory a fog .
He could not remember Thanksgiving dinner with his family , though when he was given a hint — “ turkey ” — it came back to him , vaguely , like a shadow in the moonlight .
Two years ago , Mr. Reznick , who has early - stage Alzheimer ’s disease and is now 82 , signed up for an experiment intended to help people with Alzheimer ’s and other memory disorders .
The concept was simple : using digital pictures and audio to archive an experience like a weekend visit from the grandchildren , creating a summary of the resulting content by picking crucial images , and reviewing them periodically to awaken and strengthen the memory of the event .
The hardware is a little black box called the SenseCam , which contains a digital camera and an accelerometer to measure movement .
Worn like a pendant around the neck , it was developed at Microsoft ’s research lab in Cambridge , England .
Vicon , a British company that has licensed the technology , is selling its version of the SenseCam only to researchers .
For the elderly , though , it could herald a new kind of relationship between mind and machine : even as plaque gets deposited on the brain , everyday experience is deposited on silicon , then retrieved .

You ’ve most likely experienced some examples of jargon out there in the ‘ how to get a girl ‘ realm .
Sometimes it can seem that some dudes try to come up with the most amazing sounding terms just for the hell of it .
Do n’t get me wrong , jargon has it ’s place , but sometimes they fly in the face of simple , understandable principles , and just compound confusion .
This is one of my pet peeves .
Let ’s have a look at what I think are the top 7 worst culprits :
7. pAImAI – Quick Defintion : pAImAI is short for “ pre-Approach Invitation male Approach Inviation ” .
Basically , it takes the concept of AI and reverses it to work to the man ’s advantage .
This term is totally ridiculous to say or write which is why it ’s on the list .
However , the concept can be very useful .
You are trying to get a girl to initiate IOI ’s that give you a clear indication that a girl likes you .
If you get an AI ( Approach Invitaion ) then you know it ’s on like Donkey Kong , because you know know she wants you to approach her and talk to her .
So it can be useful but the term is just ridiculous .
Sounds more like a Chinese takeaway dinner than a useful technique .
6. Hot Babe ( HB ) – Quick Definition : A beautiful woman , or any woman , rated on a scale of beauty from 1 - 10 .
Can also stand for “ Hunny Bunny ” .
The hot babe scale rubs me the wrong way sometimes .
Guess what ?
Every guy has a different opinion of which girls are hot , and which are not .
One guy might think blondes are the hottest women in town whereas others thinks Emo girls are where it ’s at .
Also it can be an ego thing , to brag about how hot the girls are you approached .
Who really cares ?
This has no place when trying to meet women .
I say leave your ego at the door and just go out and have a good time with women .
If someone thinks the girl you are with is not that attractive then f*ck em .
If you like the girl then that ’s the most important thing .
Also if a girl overheard you having a conversation saying “ Whoa she was a HB9 ” then surly they will be kinda creeped out .
Whereas saying , “ She is really hot ” is a lot more ‘ normal ’ .
Your choice .
5. Sarge –
The act of going out in field , usually with other PUAs , with the explicit intention of picking up girls .
When you go out you should be looking to have a good time first and foremost .
Going out just to meet women is kinda weird on it ’s own .
Surely you would be better off going out to have an awesome time and whilst out approaching a few women .
I believe that going out just to meet women puts a lot of un - wanted external pressure on you , which can make it even harder to talk to women .
This word makes me chuckle every time I hear it , so it does have some positive qualities .
4. 3 Minute rule – Quick Definition :
The concept of avoiding sets that could be easily interrupted within the first 3 minutes .
What ’s the problem with this term ?
Well , it gives guys another reason / excuse not to approach a girl they like .
Imagine you are about to approach a group when you get a little doubt in your mind .
It would be very easy for you to think back to this term and say , “ If I do approach the group , it ’s probably going to get interupted in the next 3 minutes or so .
Probably best I do n’t bother at all ” .
Not good …
3. Way Below Average Frustrated Chump ( WBAFC ) –
An AFC that is significantly below average in terms of skills with women .
As if ‘ Average Frustrated Chump ’ ( AFC ) was not enough .
If the poor guy was not already in such a bad place because he thinks he is bad with women , then he sure would be after you label him a ‘ Way below average frustrated chump ’ .
We need to be helping these guys , not finding new terms to make them feel even more inadequate about themselves .
Some people may just want to use the term to describe others in a negative way .
The only reason you would ever need to do this is to make yourself feel better about your own shortcomings .
If that ’s the case , then you have issues which you need to work out instead of making yourself feel better at other peoples expense .
2. Dick Crack – Quick Definition : Pickup related gossip and hero worshipping .
It defines something that is a complete waste of time and therefore it makes the term a complete waste of time .
PUA Lingo ’s own definition says it all : ‘ Stop taking dick crack and let ’s talk about something more productive . ’
1. Secret Underground Internet Seduction Community ( SUISC ) – Quick Definition : Another name for the Seduction Community .
Firstly that ’s a mouthful .
Secondly , I hope it is n’t that secret because I actually want people to find this stuff so that I can help them :-) .
Why do we feel the need to have this ‘ secret community ’ ?
We are trying to become more and more social so that are interactions with women improve .
However being part of a secret community is actually taking us further away from being normal , attractive , funny and sociable .
It makes us sound like a bunch of weird internet nerds out to trick women into bed .
Meeting women is normal and natural , not something that ’s secretive and manipulative .
So there you have it , the seven worst culprits in crimes against understanding women and dating .
Jargon has its place , and although I ’m not a huge fan of using it , I realise it can be useful when you need to explain a specific situation or technique .
The thing is , if we all spent as much time just getting out there and talking to women as some guys seem to spend sat in front of a PC dreaming up jargon , we ’d all be MPUAs ;-) ( but that ’s another story … ) .
Would love to hear what your pet hates are when it comes to jargon about how to get a girl .
Post a comment below and let me know …
Speak soon ,

Thirty years ago this month , Clive Sinclair launched a computer that he hoped would change the world .
In the majority of cases it only changed the way people played primitive computer games , but it also turned a bespectacled , prematurely balding man into a hero for our times .
In those dark days before Windows 7 and the iPad , the Sinclair ZX80 represented the pinnacle of affordable domestic computing .
It was a flat box without a screen or proper keyboard , it had the memory of a hamster and at the back of it was something that looked like a radiator grille but was actually a strip of plastic designed to look like a radiator grille .
It promised it could do " quite literally anything , from playing chess to running a power station " , which was good value for something costing £ 79.95 in kit form and £ 99.95 assembled , about one fifth of the price of other home computers .
Sir Clive , who was knighted for services to industry at the age of 43 , will be 70 later this year .
He lives in an apartment overlooking Trafalgar Square , and from his adjacent office he has a magnificent view of tourists and lions ( recently he also had a view of people performing on Antony Gormley 's fourth plinth , but that " got a bit boring really " ) .
He was a household name before Sir Alan Sugar , and for a while was the unlikely future of modern electronics : a bright , hi-tech uncle rejuvenating British industry blighted by decay , unions and Thatcher .
Sinclair helped transform Cambridge into the computing capital of the world , a homegrown version of Silicon Valley and Taipei , and for a couple of brilliant years he made the bestselling computers in the world .
And then the competition took him on , and his great machines went the way of the Spinning Jenny , and here he is in his carpet slippers nursing a heavy cold .
He says his recollections may be a little blurry , but he is clear on one thing .
Before his other inventions made him poor , the ZX80 and its successor the ZX81 made him rich .
" Oh my lord , yes , " he says as he settles on a sofa .
" Oh good God , yes .
Very much so .
I 'm just speaking from memory here , but within two or three years we made £ 14 m profit in a year .
That would be a lot today . "
He says that the ZX80 computer was named after the year it appeared , and because the letters sounded cool and futuristic .
He is keen to credit the rest of his small team at Cambridge , not least Nine Tiles , the company that made the Basic operating software .
But he is a little hazier about what the machine could actually do .
" We had several routines you could be doing within minutes , " he says .
" People could tap in a few keys and make the display do some strange things .
All very exploratory .
We had a little printer , and one guy , right at the start , came out with the program that generated hypothetical dinosaurs .
It invented their names , and printed out their pictures , and it could go on doing this indefinitely .
Then very soon a huge number of games came out and the whole thing exploded . "
" Not literally ? "
" No . "
The ZX80 sold about 50,000 units , and the ZX81 which replaced it cost £ 69.95 and sold 250,000 .
The brochure promised that a child of 12 would soon be mastering " decimals , logs and trig " , although the trig would have to be saved to a cassette recorder .
The average 2GB laptop of today has 2,000,000 times more memory than that offered by Sinclair 's first machines , although he is keen to stress that computing ability is n't everything .
" Our machines were lean and efficient , " he says .
" The sad thing is that today 's computers totally abuse their memory – totally wasteful , you have to wait for the damn things to boot up , just appalling designs .
Absolute mess !
So dreadful it's heartbreaking . "
Sinclair , who is not an especially tall man , has always been a great one for the smallness of things .
He made those little pocket calculators , he made black digital watches , and also those pocket televisions on which the newsreader Kenneth Kendall looked like Angela Rippon .
Later he would make the little C5 ( 1985 ) , way ahead of the game in the quest for an electric car , so long as you did n't actually try to take it on the road .
He says the important thing about his computers was not only their ability to help with domestic chores ( when WH Smith sold them it stressed you could " flummox your bank manager " ) , but also their capacity to expand the user 's intellectual horizons .
But it was the male hobbyists who had the most fun : adverts depict fathers programming train timetables with their sons while mum brought in the Victoria sponge .
Things really took off when the ZX became the Spectrum in 1982 , and colour games such as Jet Set Willy became the second major activity in teenage bedrooms .
Like the Chopper bike , these amusements are now retrospectively popular again , although Sinclair sees none of the rewards .
When did other companies such as Atari and Commodore begin to catch up ?
" I do n't think they did catch up .
We never had any serious competition in the sense of making machines that were cost effective by comparison .
The BBC machine Acorn was quite expensive , and only succeeded because the BBC put its name to it , which was quite outrageous .
Then the IBM machine took over .
Not because it was a good machine – it was a completely appalling design , but it was IBM , so you know … "
And what computer does he now use himself ?
" I do n't use a computer at all .
The company does . "
" So you do n't do email ? "
" No . I 've got people to do it for me . "
" If friends and family want to communicate ? "
" They can do that .
We 've got a computer in the front office , but I get someone to do it for me . "
" That seems odd to me .
Why is that ? "
" Sheer laziness I think .
I can't be bothered . "
" Do you not know how to operate it ? "
" I do know how to , but I do n't . "
" Sorry to press , but it seems the simplest thing in the world to do your own emails . "
" Well I find them annoying .
I 'd much prefer someone would telephone me if they want to communicate .
No , it 's not sheer laziness – I just do n't want to be distracted by the whole process .
Nightmare . "
When he's not not doing his emails , Sinclair occasionally appears in the tabloids pictured with a blonde former lapdancer 36 years his junior ( " He 's actually incredibly attractive to women , " his intended , Angie Bowness , whom Sinclair met in Stringfellows , has said . ) .
The rest of the time he continues in his attempt to reinvent the wheel .
He walks across the corridor to his office , where one section is given over to the A - Bike , his miniature lightweight folding bicycle .
He launched this in 2006 , and it costs £ 199.99 .
He says it 's selling well , and that he 's just solved some manufacturing problems .
I pull one out to sit on it .
" They 're not necessarily working models , " he says , " so I 'd rather you did n't . "
I ask him how it folds up .
" I wo n't go into that now if you do n't mind – I 'm not feeling too well . "
I ask him what else he is working on .
" A little electric car . "
" And what can you tell me about that ? "
" Not much . "
" When might it be viewable ? "
" I hope within a year . "
" Any resemblance to previous efforts ? "
" No , it does n't look like anything we 've done before . "
" But obviously all the big companies are doing their own electric cars . "
" But they wo n't be doing what I 'm doing , I 'm sure .
As usual I hope I 'll sell lots of them .
But who can tell ? "
Revealed :
The shocking truth about Tasers
A commuter in a diabetic coma , an 89 - year - old man and children as young as 12 - just some of the targets of British police armed with skin- piercing 50,000 - volt Taser guns .
As the Home Office investigates bringing an even more powerful rifle version to Britain , Jason Benetto reports on the slow creep of arms onto our streets .
The smartly dressed sales executive travelling on the number 96 bus across Leeds did n't notice his body descending into a state of severe hypoglycaemia .
He did n't have time to ask his fellow passengers for help , or press the bell .
Instead he slumped back in his seat in a diabetic coma , his head lolling from side to side .
This was why he wore a special tag and chain around his neck : it advertised his diabetes .
His mother and father , both retired GPs , had encouraged their son to wear it ever since he had started having to take insulin 20 years earlier .
Target practice : A Met Territorial Support Group Office with a holstered Taser
Nicholas Gaubert had been looking forward to a drink with friends in the suburb of Headingley after work .
Instead he was critically ill , unconscious on the top deck of a bus continuing its route north through the early evening rush - hour traffic .
Some 40 minutes later , it terminated at the Holt Park depot and the driver checked his vehicle .
He was used to turfing drunks off the night bus at weekends , but it was Wednesday and the man apparently fast asleep on the top deck was far from dishevelled .
On another evening , the driver may have reacted differently , but the timing tonight was bad for Gaubert : just six days after the July 7 , 2005 London bombings and one week before the fatal shooting of the Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes by police firearms officers .
Paranoia and suspicion , especially on public transport , were rife .
And Gaubert had a rucksack .
So the driver kept his distance and shouted at him to wake up and leave .
When Gaubert failed to stir , the driver climbed off the bus and told his superiors , who cleared the depot and called the police .
The nearby Asda supermarket was evacuated and an armed unit was called .
Eight firearms officers were sent ; three entered the bus .
The white male did n't look like a textbook terrorist and the bus was empty and far from the city centre .
But he was sweating profusely , would n't respond to their shouted orders and they could n't see his hands , so an officer pulled his X26 Taser stun gun out of its holster , flicked on the 50,000 - volt electric gun 's red dot laser sighter and pointed it at him .
It was the first time a West Yorkshire officer had deployed a Taser .
The man was well within the 21ft range so , when he still failed to respond , the officer shouted a final warning and squeezed the trigger .
Nicholas Gaubert was ' Tasered ' while he was in a diabetic coma
Two 20 mm - long metal barbs attached to plastic - coated copper wires shot instantly and noiselessly from the barrel .
The barbs penetrated Gaubert 's cotton shirt and embedded themselves in his skin .
For five seconds there was a crackling noise as the electricity shot down the wires and discharged into his body .
Gaubert 's body went into uncontrollable muscle spasms and he fell from his seat .
He landed face down on the floor with one hand under his body .
The police shouted again for him to show his hands but he still did n't move ; so the officer pulled the trigger for a second time .
Another wave of electricity surged down the copper wires and tore into him .
( At the subsequent inquiry , the officers would claim they had to stun Gaubert again to make sure it was safe to approach him ) .
Finally they got hold of him , put on handcuffs and put him into the back of a police van - which is when he regained consciousness and was able to shout that he needed urgent medical attention .
He was taken to Leeds General Infirmary .
' I shudder to think what could have happened if I had n't come round , ' says Gaubert .
' They would have put me in a cell and I would probably have died .
I was in a diabetic coma , and all they were bothered about was whether I was going to blow up an empty , stationary bus .
' I showed no aggression - I was unconscious and unable to respond to their demands .
I think they just saw it as an opportunity to try out their toys . '
Gaubert has since become what is believed to be the first person in the UK to obtain compensation for being shot with a Taser .
West Yorkshire Police has confirmed that it made an out - of - court settlement - thought to be tens of thousands of pounds - and an apology , after a civil action brought against them .
No such apology was received by the 89 - year - old war veteran who last year became the oldest person in the UK to be stunned with a Taser .
Three weeks before this incident , the retired carpenter had gone into a residential home for the elderly in Llandudno , North Wales .
But the confused man , who has not been named , was determined to return to his family home , just a few minutes ' walk away .
As the sun rose on a chilly Saturday morning in January he climbed out of a window at the care home and wandered the empty residential streets clutching a shard of glass .
At 6.30 am a police officer knocked him to the ground with a 50,000 - volt Taser charge .
North Wales police later said their officers feared he would commit suicide using the broken glass .
But the pensioner 's sister - in - law told Live : ' He was frightened to death and was hiding behind cars .
He told us that he held a piece of glass to his throat because he was afraid of the police - he wanted to keep them away .
' He said afterwards : " I would never have cut my throat . "
And that when he was hit by the Taser the pain was terrible .
' He fell to the floor and was handcuffed .
It 's awful that the police should end up shooting an old gentleman of his age . '
' The red target dot is pointed at the centre of the hooligan 's chest .
I shout a warning .
I 'm ignored .
So I pull the trigger and yell : ' Taser !
Taser !
Taser !'
His daughter - in - law adds : ' They treated him like an animal .
They should have talked him out of it .
That 's what they would have done in the past : talked to him , not shot him . '
The family complained , but the Independent Police Complaints Commission backed the decision to use the Taser .
In most cases it is enough for an officer to draw the Taser out of its holster or to point the laser red dot at the offender to gain control .
On other occasions officers intimidate a target by switching on the electricity so the end of the weapon sparks - known as ' arcing ' .
But Tasers were fired , or as police chiefs prefer to call it ' deployed ' , 1,765 times between April 2004 and June 2009 .
Stun gun officers have a less PC term for firing their weapon - they call it ' sparking up ' .
Since being introduced in April 2004 Tasers have been used in more than 5,400 incidents in England and Wales .
The number of people being targeted is increasing all the time , and their use can now only rise further since the decision in 2008 by then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith to fund an extra 10,000 Taser guns .
Up to 30,000 front - line officers will be armed with the new weapons .
Some forces will only let fully trained officers use them , but many will give them to officers after 18 hours ' training .
Amnesty International says 334 people in the US died between 2001 and 2008 after the stun guns were used on them .
Taser International , the Arizona - based manufacturer , dismisses these findings .
Taking aim : The XREP projectile ( far left ) and opened up to show the conductive wire and the XREP in flight ( far right )
A spokesman claims : ' In only a couple of disputed cases has a Taser been listed as the " cause " of death . '
Nonetheless , Taser International issued guidelines last October warning police to avoid shooting a suspect in the chest ' where possible ' , and acknowledging the heart - attack risk from stun guns , although they still claim the danger is ' extremely low ' .
But perhaps of greater concern than increased numbers of X26 guns is the expectation that the police will soon be armed with a new long - range model .
The more powerful weapon can immobilise a suspect for 20 seconds from 100ft away and is being tested by Home Office scientists .
The eXtended Range Electronic Projectile ( XREP ) , the size of a shotgun cartridge , is designed to pierce the target 's skin and then deliver a 500 - volt shock from its battery - powered circuits ( the lesser voltage makes no difference to the pain and paralysing effect ) .
Senior officers believe the XREP could be used in riots and other serious public order confrontations .
The Home Office says the new weapon is still under consideration , but a police source told Live : ' It is not a question of if , but when we get the go - ahead on this .
This is an extremely useful bit of kit . '
The XREP round has three fins that pop out as it rotates through the air to increase its accuracy .
It is fronted by four barbs designed to pierce clothing and skin , securing the projectile to the target 's body .
Six more electrodes fan out at point of impact , distributing the shock over a greater body area than the X26 .
Prongs to the fore : A TSG officer on a police raid
It can be fired from any 12 - gauge shotgun , but Taser has developed a custom - designed shotgun , in conjunction with American firearms company Mossberg .
It uses ' ammunition key ' technology to prevent accidentally using normal shotgun cartridges , and comes with a distinctive yellow stock and forearm .
There is also a special mount that allows a Taser X26 to be attached to the underside of the barrel , so police could carry both weapons at the same time .
The possibility of this very different kind of Taser weapon coming into widespread use has provoked great concern among human rights organisations .
Oliver Sprague , the UK's Arms Programme Director of Amnesty International , says : ' Because it 's a projectile weapon it's much more likely to cause injury and damage if it hits someone in the face or head . '
He adds : ' The key concern , however , is instead of Tasers being used in genuinely life - threatening cases , you start to see it creep into mainstream policing .
It is disturbing to consider that a Taser could be in the hands of every police officer in a matter of years . '
' I'm walking down a long room in the dark .
I know there 's a violent thug lurking somewhere in the shadows ; I 've been warned .
It 's nerve - racking , even though I 'm armed with a Taser .
' Suddenly a huge man wearing a motorcycle helmet leaps out in front of me .
He starts slamming a baseball bat on the ground and shouting threats .
My heart goes into overdrive .
' I manage to pull my stun gun out of its holster and turn it on , all without electrocuting myself .
The red target dot is pointed at the centre of the hooligan 's chest , and I shout a warning .
I 'm ignored .
So I pull the trigger .
' What happens next reminds me of firing an old - fashioned spud gun ; there is hardly any resistance or noise .
The lightweight weapon looks and feels like an item from Lego's Star Wars range , but the comparisons with child 's play end there .
' The metal prongs shoot out too fast to see .
Amazingly , they are on target and lodge into my target 's chest .
For five seconds there 's a crackling noise as the electricity flows and I yell ' Taser !
Taser !
Taser !'
The burst of 50,000 volts is automatically sent down the wires , but this shock can be repeated at the pull of the trigger .
The Taser can also be held against a person and the electric charge activated .
This is known by officers as a ' drive - stun ' .
Because this is a Metropolitan Police Taser refresher training day in west London , my would - be assailant , who is now lying flat on his back , is heavily padded and wearing a protective vest .
Pulling the trigger felt like a no - brainer , but in real life most encounters involving Tasers are nowhere near as straightforward , and require officers to think fast under pressure .
Critics do acknowledge that , when used properly , the Taser provides the police with an invaluable addition to their arsenal .
The weapon has undoubtedly saved lives , prevented hundreds of serious injuries to both the police and suspects and reduced the number of times officers have had to open fire with more deadly conventional handguns and semi-automatic rifles .
They have also proved an effective deterrent against violent offenders .
Sergeant Andy Harding is the Met's Territorial Support Group 's lead Taser instructor and a national police stun gun adviser .
Since being introduced in April 2004
Tasers have been used in more than 5,400 incidents in England and Wales
He says , ' A few years ago you would have had doors being splintered , hand - to - hand fighting , and people getting injured .
' The huge difference now is that you do n't need to get up close and personal .
People are aware of what a Taser can do and are terrified of the red dot . '
But while the Metropolitan Police 's TSG public order unit has won plaudits from around the world for their Taser training and deployment , there is growing concern that other British police forces and squads are far less stringent when it comes to using the weapons .
National police guidelines state that a Taser should only be used in situations where an officer is ' facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public , themselves or the subject . '
There also appear to be alarming differences between police forces as to how guidelines are interpreted .
You might think London 's Metropolitan Police , as the biggest force in England and Wales , should logically be the ' Taser capital ' of Britain .
But the title goes to a force 250 miles north - Northumbria .
Despite having only 4,100 officers ( compared with the Met 's 32,600 ) Northumbria comes top of the Taser league table , having used a Taser 797 times from April 2004 to June 2009 , compared with 751 by the Met .
Third place goes to West Yorkshire with 378 .
Comparisons with other forces further highlight this Taser postcode lottery .
For example , in Merseyside , whose police force is slightly bigger than Northumbria , Tasers have only been used 80 times since April 2004 .
The new long - range Taser rifle , which can immobilise a suspect for 20 seconds from 100ft away , with an X26 pistol mounted beneath it
And as Live has discovered , not only are they being used more often , but increasingly police forces are deploying them against children .
Records obtained using Freedom of Information requests show that the police in England and Wales fired or threaten to fire Tasers against at least 142 under - 18s in the 20 months up to the end of August 2009 .
The youngest case disclosed involved a 12 - year - old boy who was threatened with a Taser after West Mercia police were called to a school in Kidderminster in February 2008 .
The boy had threatened staff with a pair of scissors .
After officers with Tasers were deployed he surrendered his weapon and was arrested .
Northumbria officers used Tasers against under - 18s 33 times , including stunning four 16 - year - olds and a 15 - year - old , in the 20 months up to August 2009 .
This compares with 24 incidents in the Met during the same period .
North Wales Police
Tasered three 16 - year - olds in the first eight months of 2009 ; the force will reveal only that the incidents involved boys ' threatening self harm ' .
In another incident in North Wales in February 2008 an officer Tasered a 15 year - old boy who was smashing up furniture at his home in Gwynedd .
Experts warn against Taser use on children because of the risk of a heart attack .
The Government advisory body , the Defence Scientific Advisory Council , notes ' children and adults of small stature [ are ] at potentially greater risk from the cardiac effects of Taser currents than normal adults of average or large statue . '
National police guidance stresses that officers should be ' vigilant ' in considering whether to stun a child or small person .
But a Home Office spokeswoman counters : ' The latest statement from independent medical advisors states that the risk of death or serious injury from the use of Tasers is very low . '
America , by virtue of its numbers and longer experience , has the most extreme anecdotes about Tasers .
One of the most disturbing incidents took place last November , after local police were called to a home in Ozark , near Little Rock , Arkansas , to investigate a reported domestic - disturbance .
According to the report by Sheriff Dustin Bradshaw , when he arrived , a ten - year - old girl was curled up on the floor and screaming .
The officer wrote in his official report : ' Her mother told me to " Tase " her if I needed to . '
The officer tried to take the girl , who has emotional problems , into custody .
But she was ' violently kicking and verbally combative ' and kicked him in the groin .
So Sheriff Bradshaw delivered ' a very brief drive stun to her back , ' his report said .
The girl 's father did n't approve of his daughter being shocked with 50,000 volts .
Anthony Medlock told a local newspaper : ' My daughter does n't deserve to be Tasered . '
No disciplinary action is to be taken against the officer after his boss defended his action .
Liberal Democrat shadow home secretary Chris Huhne believes the UK should learn from the US experience of Tasers .
He says : ' Given the serious concerns about the safety of Tasers , which have killed more than 300 people in the US , they should not be used on children .
' Ministers should not be putting Tasers in the hands of any more police officers until they really know how dangerous they are .
A full inquiry into their use must be conducted before they are rolled out any further . '
Not all forces agree with the decision to arm nonspecialist officers .
Sussex Police and the Metropolitan Police are among those which are refusing to extend the use of Tasers to the rank and file .
Northumbria Police , however , defends its use of the weapons .
Assistant Chief Constable Steve Ashman says , ' Far from endangering the public I would contest that such usage of this tool has resulted in less risk to the public and police officers alike . '
This positive view is not one shared by Nicholas Gaubert , who accused police of using him for ' target practice ' when they stunned him twice while he was unconscious in a diabetic coma .
Gaubert 's solicitor Ifti Manzoor is equally scathing : ' The question remains - why did n't it cross the police 's mind that this man might be ill ?
Instead they opted to hit an innocent man with 50,000 volts .
My client believes he is fortunate to still be alive .'
With increasing numbers of guns , the danger of them being used as a first resort and the potential arrival of a powerful new weapon , fears will only grow that too often the response appears to be to stun first , ask questions later .

See the following pages for Haskell Hackathons in Zurich , Switzerland :
That 56 percent of all Americans " think the federal government ’s become so large and powerful that it poses an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens " is n’t really all that surprising .
After all , ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the government ’s " right " to read our e-mails , seize our property , hold us as " enemy combatants , " and otherwise trample on the Constitution has been expanding at an exponential pace .
What ’s really shocking , however , is that , according to this CNN - Opinion Research Corporation poll , released on Feb. 28 , most of the people who believe this are overwhelmingly … Republicans .
That is , they are self - described supporters of the very same party which impaled the Constitution on the sword of the " war on terrorism . "
According to the poll , " only 37 percent of Democrats " believe this , as opposed to " 63 percent of Independents and nearly 7 in 10 Republicans . "
Is it just me , or was it only yesterday that the Democratic base was outraged by " Bushitler , " and the " Cheney - PNAC " alleged neo -fascists who were taking over the country and driving dissent underground ?
How quickly they turn !
Adding to the irony , the poll was taken on the same weekend the extension of the PATRIOT
Act passed the Democratic –controlled Congress – without debate , without a peep of protest from the " progressives " in Congress , and disguised as a vote in favor of a Senate amendment to the Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act .
Bravery is not something we see much of in Washington , D.C.
As one blogger put it :
" So , if you heard the news of a Patriot Act vote , and went looking for the roll call , you would n’t find it .
You ’d see roll call # 67 for this year , but would reasonably conclude that the vote is thoroughly unrelated to the Patriot Act .
If you had n’t heard of the Patriot Act extension , and just wanted to see what legislation had been voted on yesterday , you would come away still ignorant of what the House of Representatives had actually done . "
The shamefaced Democrats are too cowardly to openly acknowledge their contribution to the destruction of the Constitution : instead , they ’re hoping we do n’t notice more Democrats than Republicans voted for the extension of this odious Act .
At one point , the Dems were hinting that they might want to " reform " the Act , and put in certain " privacy protections , " but they soon gave that up and now their media amen corner is busy demonizing " anti-government zealots " who dare to question the ongoing government takeover of … practically everything .
Keith Olbermann is still going on about how many days it ’s been since George W. Bush declared " Mission accomplished ! " in Iraq – even as President Barack Obama ’s generals warn that we ’ll still be stuck in that particular quagmire well beyond the withdrawal date supposedly set by their commander - in - chief .
Not only that , but Obama is fighting a secret war in Pakistan , continuing the previous administration ‘s war on our civil liberties , and extending its tentacles into every aspect of American life – yes , even our health care .
The " PATRIOT " Act , all several hundred pages of it , was passed in the dead of night without being read , without being adequately debated , and with the full official approval of both parties , who unhesitatingly wiped out two - hundred years of constitutional law in a procedure that lasted for less than an hour .
“ The president ’s reversal on Patriot Act reform is a major travesty , ” says Michelle Richardson , the ACLU ’s legislative counsel , a bit of phraseology that just about sums up the first year of Obama ’s reign .
All those liberal hearts , broken by that seductive love - ’em - and - leave - ’em Chicago smoothie – except no one ’s complaining .
The Associated Press reported the vote in terms that can only be described as odd :
" Democrats have retreated from adding new privacy protections to the nation ’s primary counterterrorism law , stymied by Senate Republicans who argued the changes would weaken terror investigations .
The proposed protections were cast aside when Senate Democrats lacked the necessary 60 - vote supermajority to pass them . "
The Democrats have … retreated ?
Since most of them voted for the " PATRIOT " Act to begin with , I would n’t exactly phrase it that way .
As the Democratic majority gets ready to ram an immensely unpopular " health - care reform " bill through the Congress without a " super- majority , " one can only wonder at their priorities .
Is it really more important to force poor Americans to buy insurance they can’t afford than it is to save our constitutional liberties from being crushed underfoot ?
Apparently so .
Passed in a time of " emergency , " and touted as a temporary measure , the " PATRIOT " Act has , like all such measures , become routine : part and parcel of the legal - political landscape , which no one really questions .
The " right " of the government to impound our records , seize our property , jail us , fine us , and haul us before a military tribunal – all of this has now become " normal . "
Did you know that a recipient of a " National Security Letter " – say , your Internet provider – must not only hand over all records , documents , and what - have - you to the Feds , but must also refrain from talking about or otherwise revealing the existence of the letter ?
Just like they can simply take you in the dead of night , throw you in a cell– and , yes , even torture you , if they feel like it – and no one need ever know .
Accepting this as a fait accompli is now " normal " in Washington , D.C.
No wonder the majority of Americans consider the federal government a dangerous enemy – and they ’re all too right about that .
The question is : what do we do about it ?
Here ’s where the confusion comes in .
While there are many indications that Americans are waking up to the main danger to their liberty and livelihoods – a danger that does n’t reside in a cave somewhere , overseas , but right here in the good ol ’ US of A – the political class in this country is deeply ensconced , and wo n’t be pried out of power with a crowbar .
It will take something with a lot more explosive power .
No , I ’m not talking about an ordinary bomb – violence would only embolden them .
I ’m talking about the debt bomb , which is scheduled to go off in the very near future .
We wo n’t have to defeat the army of federal occupation militarily – because they ’re about to go bankrupt .
Just wait until they can’t pay their SWAT teams , their Homeland Security goons , their multitudinous minions in every snooping federal agency : do they imagine that these people will stay on out of loyalty or ideological fervor ?
Or out of " patriotism " ?
Well of course they do n’t imagine that , which is why , these days , they ’re notably nervous .
This nervousness pervades elite circles in this country , and is expressed in a peevish impatience with any sort of dissidence , on any subject : if you fall out of line , they swat you – and you stay down , if they can help it .
The tea-partiers , the antiwar protesters ( such as they are ) , the stray politician who dares speak truth to power – anyone who expresses an opinion deemed outside the very narrow range of the permissible is automatically attacked as a " extremist , " a dangerous " radical , " and very possibly a potentially violent person whose every move is rightfully being mapped by the authorities .
Intersecting with this skittishness is an impending sense of economic and social crisis .
Real fear , such as we have n’t experienced in a mass way since 9/11 , pervades the air : an entirely justified fear of an economic collapse .
Last year , when the banks trembled on the edge of a very steep precipice , lawmakers were told " in private " that if the bank bailout was n’t passed , " there would be martial law in America , " as Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - California ) revealed on the House floor .
" Now that ’s what I call fear - mongering , " said Rep. Sherman , but in my view this was n’t a bluff .
In the midst of an economic collapse , an " event " in which the stock market drops by , say , 5,000 points , and there ’s a run on the dollar , as Ron Paul predicts , I do n’t think there ’s any question but that the authorities would immediately impose martial law .
In Ayn Rand ’s classic novel of American decline , Atlas Shrugged , a giant oak tree stands on the property of the heroine ’s family estate : it had been there as long as she could remember , towering over the landscape like a living monument to stability and continuity .
One night during a thunderstorm the tree – an oak – was struck by lightning .
When she came out to the charred scene in the morning she saw that the tree had split open , revealing nothing but a hollow shell .
I ’m afraid this is precisely what will happen if – or , rather , when – economic lightning hits our brittle society : it is likely to shatter and reveal the vast emptiness that has taken over where the American character once resided .
As Rep .
Paul points out in this video , rather than resisting martial law , the American people in their majority will probably demand it .
That will mark the end of the American experiment , as we knew it .
The vision of the Founders will go down in history as a tragic failure – one that took an awful lot of people down with it .
If this is not to be the future , then where are the mass protests against the reauthorization of a totalitarian
Act such as has n’t been seen in this country since the Alien and Sedition Acts ?
Where are the liberals ?
Where are the old - style conservatives ?
Where is the America I once knew – the America of the Founders , a cantankerous and quarrelsome lot , whom no tyrant could tame ?
I fear we have become a decadent and fatally corrupted people , for whom the Founders are those guys with funny wigs , slave - owners who would n’t let women vote , with a lot of strange , anti-social ideas , like Jefferson ’s Tim McVeigh - ish belief that " The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time , with the blood of patriots and tyrants . "
A few liberals , like Glenn Greenwald , have spoken out , but their numbers only underscore the underlying silence : a few conservatives of the old school have raised their voices in protest , but they , too , are isolated , and are , in any case , ignored by their fellows on the right , at least those in the GOP , who vehemently support the " PATRIOT " Act and all the rest of the Bush - Cheney era legislation aimed at subverting the Constitution .
" Oh Obama , you silly neocon ! " japed Ryan Mauro over at Frontpage , and for once I have to agree with ( yikes ! ) David Horowitz :
" Sometimes partisanship and heated debates makes us forget how little has changed and how little really divides the two parties when it comes to national security .
The rhetoric was changed and the policies had to be repackaged , modified a little bit to better fit the administration ’s own beliefs and political promises , but what ’s actually being done has changed very little .
Policies , like celebrities , need to be reinvented to stay with the times .
" Case in point : President Obama has just signed a one - year extension of the Patriot Act .
" The entire legislation was n’t preserved , though — so surely it was refined to limit its violations of civil liberties , right ?
Think again .
As The Associated Press reports , ‘ Thrown away were restrictions and greater scrutiny on the government ’s authority to spy on Americans and seize their records . ’
Oh , snap ! "
I ’m unsure as to whether " Oh , snap ! " is meant approvingly , but no matter .
The point is that this is " change " the neocons can believe in .
And while the anti-Obama market is too lucrative for Horowitz to give it up , others are not so " principled . "
David Frum , whose own security prescriptions go way beyond the " PATRIOT " Act , has lately been urging his fellow conservatives to go a little easier on Obama , and urging compromise on economic matters – because what the neocons really care about is foreign policy and civil liberties questions .
As long as we have an all - powerful surveillance state , which is waging war on multiple fronts at all times , the David Frums of this world are happy .
I hope the folks over at the David Horowitz Center for Freedom , or whatever it is his outfit is called these days , are confident that the power they would grant the Obama administration will never be used in a way they would come to regret – say , against them .
But do n’t worry , David : when they come for you and lock you up in a reeducation camp , we ’ll spring you – you know , like your former buddies in the Weather Underground sprang Timothy Leary .
Aside from neocon loons like Horowitz , I think a lot of " progressives " would readily support the imposition of martial law in an " economic emergency " – as Rahm Emanuel would say , " Rule one : never allow a crisis to go to waste . "
Ca n’t you just hear certain self - righteous " progressives " ( not liberals ) justifying censorship , a ban on public gatherings , or other assaults on our constitutional rights , on the grounds that certain speech and nonviolent action is " divisive , " " hateful , " and a threat to public order ?
I certainly hope conservatives do n’t learn to value civil liberties the hard way , but if that ’s what it takes , then so be it .
By then liberals will have already forgotten that particular lesson – and the ideological spectrum will undergo yet another re-polarization , where left becomes right , right becomes left , and the cycle starts all over again … .
A very unpleasant little amendment to the Licensing Act ( 2003 ) is in front of Ministers for approval as a Statutory Instrument ( SI ) .
If you ’re not familiar with the process , a SI is a delegated legislation made under the powers of a parent Act , and it is very rare for a SI to be amended or changed – it is generally either approved or rejected when presented to Parliament .
The SI in question is there to address binge drinking by restricting licensees ’ abilities to offer discounted booze and encourage heavy drinking .
Part 4 ( 2 ) of this particular SI refers to a licensee ’s policy , and reads as follows :
(2) The policy must require individuals who appear to the responsible person to be under 18 years of age ( or such older age as may be specified in the policy ) to produce on request , before being served alcohol , identification bearing their photograph , date of birth and a holographic mark .
I ’d like to think that this is simply a bit of shoddy text drafted by a junior civil servant who has n’t thought it through properly , but that seems unlikely .
The only acceptable proof of age in a licensed premises will be either a passport , a driving license or an ID Card .
Licensees will no longer be able to use common sense , or to accept other forms of ID even where they are credible beyond doubt .
Young drinkers wo n’t dare go out without one of those forms of ID on them , and that will inevitably lead to a rise in the number of lost passports – something that Identity Minister Meg Hillier has been banging on about as almost the sole justification for the National ID Service for a long time now .
It seems probable that this move is an attempt by a government that has almost no understanding of ID technology , and an active interest in undermining privacy , to force yet another justification for ID Cards through without proper scrutiny .
What this will do is create a fresh market for false ID cards .
A card with a photo , hologram and date of birth is still relatively trivial to put together , and is the average member of bar staff really going to challenge someone who is in possession of what looks like it is probably a legitimate card ?
I doubt it .
Just over a year ago I warned the BBC of the dangers of ‘ flash and dash ’ fraud that will arise from the misuse of ID Cards , and this is the first stage in making that situation come to pass .
For a long time those who have given more than the briefest of thought to the challenge of proof of age have understood the potential of ID technologies to be used in a zero disclosure way : to respond to a challenge without providing any information about the data subject .
The relying party asks the system ‘ is the individual 18 years of age or over ? ’
The system responds ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no ’ .
No other information is released .
Innovative organisations such as Touch2ID have put the concept into practice , and offer contactless proof of age cards that simply contain a biometric hash of the bearer ’s fingerprint .
The licensee ’s reader asks the card ‘ is the bearer 18 years of age or over ’ ?
The bearer puts their finger on the reader , the biometric is compared with the hash on the card , and a positive or negative response is given .
The card does n’t need a photo , or a date of birth , so the individual retains their privacy .
The card is issued for free .
If the card is lost then it ’s useless to anyone else , ca n’t be used for identity fraud , and can be replaced for £ 2.50 .
This ridiculous SI , which is another back - door attempt to undermine civil liberties and bolster the National ID Service , will pass on 6 April unless it is sent back by Parliament .
You need to write to your MP to make them aware of what ’s hidden in the small print , and demand that the SI is redrafted before it ’s accepted .

{ March 7 , 2010} Activities and Context , again
So I promised I ’d write about all the activity / context stuff we discussed at tokamak , did n’t I ?
I was hoping to have something to show first , some pretty screenshots – but that ’s going to take a little longer , it seems .
In the meantime , I guess words will have to do .
So … where shall I start ?
Well , let ’s go over the pieces involved .
The most visible part of Context will probably be the workspace UI – plasma and kwin .
Plasma will , of course , have the UI for managing Activities .
Kwin ( KWin ? ) will filter out the windows that should n’t be shown , and allow you to manually associate windows with activities ( after all , in the beginning few applications will be context - aware ) .
In plasma we ’re starting simple , with something that ’s sort of a much prettier Activity Bar , sharing some UI code with the widget explorer ( which means I ’ll probably clean up some widget explorer code while I ’m in there , too ) .
From there I can add features and make it something that actually allows management of the activities , based on the mockups one of our designers drew at tokamak .
( uhm , anyone got photos of that ? )
There ’ll probably be a behaviour change too : when there are multiple screens , they ’ll still have one containment each but they ’ll be treated as one “ activity ” , switching together and being closed and opened together .
That means we ’ll have to provide a sensible way of dealing with ‘ orphan ’ containments when a screen ’s disconnected , though .. aw fuck , I completely forgot to bring that up at tokamak .
grr .
Anyways , it looks like I ’m going to be doing most of this plasma / kwin stuff ; the only part I can guarantee will be in 4.5 is the most essential features of the plasma actvity UI .
Still , it ’s looking like I ’ll have more hacking time soon , so hopefully I ’ll get a lot more done . :)
Then there ’s the plumbing : all the behind - the - scenes stuff that makes things actually work .
Nepomuk will store associations , since that ’s what it ’s good at ; connecting all the related documents and contacts and things with the activity ’s UID .
Then there ’ll be a simple little kded module that handles activity management : something that apps can easily query to know what activities there are and which one the user is in right now n’stuff .
We ’ll also have some convenience code in kdecore for talking to that kded module – that way kde apps do n’t have to mess around with dbus to be activity - aware .
Oh , and there ’ll be another API for workspace , for actual management of the activities ( creating / destroying them , etc ) .
One neat thing that we ’re doing in the backend is that windows can advertise what documents they ’re working on – that can be used to associate them with activites automatically , but may also lead to other interesting stuff , like kwin knowing what tabs are open in your browser …
Ivan ’s doing this work – in fact he ’s already done a lot of it ( and blogged about it ) , but it ’s been hiding in playground .
You ’re going to get that into kdereview now , right , ivan ? :)
Another backend bit coming later will be session management – when you close an activity all the windows that belong only to that activity should close too ( and then come back again when you open it , of course :) .
I * think * I can make that happen with XSMP , but I need to look into a couple of things to make sure it ’s actually possible , and I still have n’t got around to that .
XSMP is n’t the nicest of protocols ( lubos told me some scary things about it at tokamak ) , but it has one huge advantage : apps are using it already .
And applications are the third piece of the puzzle .
Once we have the backend in place , and workspace programs using it , we need apps to use it too .
If they advertise their content , they can be associated automatically with activities .
They could offer other cool features too , adapting to the current activity …
I ’m sure people will think of cool stuff to do with it once we ’ve got a few apps to serve as examples . :)
So we have workspace stuff to let the user manage their activities , a few things in the back holding it all together , and apps adapting to the activity ( and perhaps other contextual info someday ) .
The activities serve as a sort of anchor for your context – a way to say clearly ( to both you and your computer ) “ I ’m working on this project now ” or “ I ’m just gonna read comics and surf the web ” .
The context behind that activity gives it meaning – associations with the documents you use for that project , tools you use , contacts who are involved … that sort of thing .
And the apps are , usually , where the actual work gets done . :)
I ’m really looking forward to the day when I can just start a new activity , drag some windows ( or tabs ? ) over there and go work on it without getting it all tangled up with whatever I was working on earlier . :)
Bernard Madoff , who is serving a 150 - year sentence in North Carolina for running a fraud scheme that cost investors billions of dollars , was physically assaulted by another inmate in December , according to three people familiar with the matter .
After the attack , Mr. Madoff , who pleaded guilty a year ago and was sent to a federal prison in Butner , N.C. , was moved on Dec. 18 to the prison 's low - security medical center for treatment .
At the time , the Bureau of Prisons said that rumors of an assault were false and that Mr. Madoff ...

2010 Porsche 911 Turbo GTStreet R by TECHART
The ban on refuelling gave the race a very different structure to what we saw in 2009 , with almost every car one - stopping .
For several drivers that meant a frustrating day stuck behind rivals , unable to get close enough to try a pass .
The start
The oil - belching Mark Webber initially lost places to Jenson Button and Michael Schumacher – but a canny pass around the outside of turn nine got Webber ahead of Button again .
Robert Kubica and Adrian Sutil collided while distracted by Webber ’s smoke , and fell behind all the other cars except the HRT duo who started their race in the pit lane .
The biggest benefact was Kubica ’s team mate Vitaly Petrov , who made up six places with a clean start .
Hamilton stuck behind Rosberg
Lewis Hamilton ’s attempt to pass Felipe Massa at the start ended up with him losing a place to Nico Rosberg .
That cost him dearly , as the lap times above show .
Despite being able to lap 0.5 - 1 seconds faster than Rosberg , the aerodynamic wake from the Mercedes prevent Hamilton from getting close enough to try to pass .
After his pit stop , where he ’d got ahead of Rosberg , Hamilton was more or less able to keep pace with the Ferraris .
Towards the end of the race Fernando Alonso let rip and set a series of fast lap that neither Hamilton nor Felipe Massa , who seemed to have some kind of problem , could keep up with .
Vettel ’s problem
I ’d only just Tweeted that the race was “ coming to the boil nicely ” when it all fell apart .
Alonso and Massa had been slowly catching Sebastian Vettel but suddenly his lap times increased and it became clear he had a problem .
As the graph shows Vettel coped admirably well with his exhaust fault and brought his lap times back down again .
So much so that while it looked at first like he might drop out of the points completely he was able to stay ahead of Nico Rosberg for fourth .
It ’s a long season and the points Vettel salvaged today could prove highly valuable later on .
New teams
As expected , new teams Lotus and Virgin were very closely matched for pace and we saw some good racing between them .
But they were a couple of seconds off the pace of the slowest of the established runners .
They were not a close match on reliability , however .
Both Virgins were gone within 16 laps , both Lotuses were classified , although Trulli experienced some hydraulic problems which ended his race early .
They were lapped a lot , which is what the spikes towards the end of Kovalainen ’s line are .
HRT F1 were further off Lotus and Virgin ’s pace than these two were off the rest of the field , but that is to be expected when they ’ve had no testing .
Pit stops
The standard strategy at Bahrain was a single pit stop around the lap 15 mark followed by a long 30 - plus lap stint to the flag .
Generally it was the drivers who made their pit stops earliest who gained places – Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher for example .
The crucial calculation being made on the pit wall is how early a driver can make his pit stop and come out in clean air without a slower car in front .
Race and lap charts
The Bahrain Grand Prix was a processional affair – more on that later .
Most of the pit stops happened on laps 15 and 16 as the field spread out and the front runners found themselves able to pit and resume racing in clean air .
Given how most of the front runners were able to get to the end of the race without any obvious tyre problems we could see even early first stops in future races .
Unless the ‘ option ’ tyre has a significant performance advantage , one - stopping could be the way to go at many races this year .

Google 's partners are getting a stern warning from Chinese authorities over Google 's decision to ditch censorship in the country , which some believe has already begun .
An " industry expert " speaking anonymously to the New York Times said that a notice went out to Google 's biggest online partners on Friday , telling them to be prepared to continue censoring search results no matter what Google does .
As we covered on Friday , Google is on the verge of either ending its censorship of search results or pulling its business out of China , although insiders say that Google is trying to work out an agreement with a handful of agencies so it does n't have to leave altogether .
China 's Minister of Industry and Information Technology , however , has made it clear that if the company does n't respect Chinese laws with regards to censorship , " the consequences will be on you . "
According to the Times , the government 's warning to Google 's partners is primarily meant to avoid confusion if China is forced to flip the switch on the Great Firewall to block Google 's results .
Like other parts of the world , there are numerous Chinese portals that use Google - powered search boxes on their sites , and readers might be a little more frustrated when it's not just Google .
cn that 's being blocked , but also sina.com.cn or ganji.com .
Implementing a last - minute switch to another search service could be difficult for those sites , though , so it seems reasonable to expect that there will be some downtime for one and all .
According to some , however , Decision Day has already arrived : Silicon Alley Insider notes that Beijing resident Bill Bishop is already pulling up uncensored results for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 , which were previously blocked within China .
Other taboo subjects remain inaccessible , however , meaning that the Tiananmen Square results are either a bug or evidence of Google testing the waters before going whole hog .
Given the company 's commitment to standing by its original word , we 're going to guess the latter .
You be the judge , is this chart the scariest of all time ?
Here 's how Nathan A. Martin explains it :
This is a very simple chart .
It takes the change in GDP and divides it by the change in Debt .
What it shows is how much productivity is gained by infusing $ 1 of debt into our debt backed money system .
Back in the early 1960s a dollar of new debt added almost a dollar to the nation ’s output of goods and services .
As more debt enters the system the productivity gained by new debt diminishes .
This produced a path that was following a diminishing line targeting ZERO in the year 2015 .
This meant that we could expect that each new dollar of debt added in the year 2015 would add NOTHING to our productivity .
Then a funny thing happened along the way .
Macroeconomic DEBT SATURATION occurred causing a phase transition with our debt relationship .
This is because total income can no longer support total debt .
In the third quarter of 2009 each dollar of debt added produced NEGATIVE 15 cents of productivity , and at the end of 2009 , each dollar of new debt now SUBTRACTS 45 cents from GDP !
Quinnipiac confirms what Democratic strategists have banked on : tea party candidates could hurt the Republican Party at the polls this November .
Tea party candidates , running as third - party candidates or incorporated under state - registered Tea Parties , would siphon votes from Republican candidates in congressional elections this fall , Quinnipiac finds .
From Quinnipiac 's release :
While voters say 44 - 39 percent that they will vote for a Republican over a Democratic candidate in this November 's Congressional elections , if there is a Tea Party candidate on the ballot , the Democrat would get 36 percent to the Republican 's 25 percent , with 15 percent for the Tea Party candidate ...
That 's exactly what could be happening in Nevada , where Tea Party candidate Scott Ashjian could upset the GOP 's chances of defeating Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in his reelection race .
Self - identified tea partiers are actually just Republicans and Republican - leaning independents , Quinnipiac finds :
• 74 percent are Republicans or independent voters leaning Republican ;
• 16 percent are Democrats or independent voters leaning Democratic ;
• 5 percent are solidly independent ;
• 45 percent are men ;
• 55 percent are women ;
• 88 percent are white ;
• 77 percent voted for Sen. John McCain in 2008 ;
• 15 percent voted for President Barack Obama .
A caveat about this set of data : the sample size of tea partiers is small .
Quinnipiac surveyed 1,907 registered voters nationwide , and 253 self - identified as tea partiers .
The margin of error among tea partiers was +/-6.2 % .

Advertisement Voters in Iceland have overwhelmingly rejected proposals to pay the UK and the Netherlands in the wake of collapse of the Icesave bank .
With a third of results counted , 93 % of voters said " No " in a referendum .
The British and Dutch governments want reimbursement for the 3.8bn euros ( £ 3.4bn ; $ 5.2 bn ) they paid out in compensation to customers in 2008 .
Speaking to the BBC , Chancellor Alistair Darling said the UK would get its money back , if not for many years .

" It 's not a matter of whether the sum should be paid .
There is no question we will get the money back but what I am prepared to do is to talk to Iceland about the terms and conditions of the repayment , " he told the BBC's Politics Show .
Asked about how long it would take for the UK to be repaid , Mr Darling said it would take " many , many years " .
The referendum followed the breakdown of talks on Friday between Iceland , the UK and the Netherlands .
Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir refused to vote in Saturday 's poll and said her government was seeking to continue the negotiations .
Have Your Say Why should I become financially liable for British councils ' debts because of the actions of a few greedy people ?
Akureyi - geitunger , Iceland
With a third of votes counted , 93 % of Icelanders have voted " No " , less than 2 % back the deal , and the remaining votes are invalid .
Johanna Sigurdardottir said that her government would stay in office , despite the " No " results .
" This has no impact on the life of the government , " she said .
" Now we need to get on with the task in front of us , namely to finish the negotiations with the Dutch and the British . "
During voting on Saturday , hundreds of protesters outside parliament in the capital Reykjavik banged pots and waved banners reading " Icesave No! No! No ! " .
As results came in , Foreign Minister Ossur Skarphethinsson said talks with the UK and the Netherlands would continue , adding that the referendum result was good for his government 's position .
" It certainly does n't weaken our hand , " Ossur Skarphethinsson said .
Referendum defended
The government had hoped to avoid the vote by agreeing a new repayment plan before the weekend .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Ossur Skarphethinsson told Reuters news agency he expected a new Icesave deal " in the next weeks , perhaps sooner " .
Britain and the Netherlands want the money as repayment for bailing out customers in the Icesave online bank , which folded in 2008 due to the global financial meltdown .
President Grimsson rejected suggestions the vote was meaningless .
" It 's not a pointless exercise because the referendum , according to our constitution , is on whether the deal which the British and the Dutch insisted on at the end of last year , should remain in force as a law in this country , " he told the BBC .
The rage and the feeling of unfairness here is overwhelming
Ingveldur Eiríksdóttir , Selfoss , Iceland
Icelanders react to ' No ' vote " It is encouraging that in the last few weeks the British and the Dutch have acknowledged that that deal , on which the referendum takes place , is an unfair deal and that is by itself a tremendous achievement by the referendum ... we will be able to continue the negotiations . "
Many Icelanders believe the plan should be rejected because they feel they are being penalised for the mistakes of the banking industry .
" I will vote ' No ' simply because I disagree very strongly with us ... having to shoulder this burden , " Ingimar Gudmundsson , a lorry driver , told AFP news agency .
" We want to pay our debts but we want to do it without going bankrupt , " Steinunn Ragnarsdottir , a pianist who voted in Reykjavik City Hall , told Reuters .
Britain accused
There is also anger against the UK for using anti-terrorist legislation to freeze Icesave assets in the country .
Some 230,000 Icelanders were eligible to vote on Saturday
Arni Gunnarsson , a former Icelandic MP , told the BBC News website : " We have not forgotten how Britain used battleships against Iceland during the cod wars .
" We find this a very strange method of thanking the Icelandic people for sacrificing the lives of their seamen during World War II .
" The colonial attitude is still going strong .
The UK should come to its senses . "
The Reykjavik government approved the repayment plan last December but it was blocked by President Grimsson in January , which led to the referendum being called .

The recently discovered Anglo - Saxon treasures known as the Safforshire Hoard are to form part of a new West Midlands heritage trail tracing the history of Mercia
When just some of the Staffordshire Hoard went on display at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery , hundreds of people waited for more than four hours at a time to stand in awe at the glittering gold and silver artefacts .
Over the past few weeks , these objects , including a stunning gold filigree horse 's head , never previously shown , have been wowing visitors again at The Potteries Museum in Stoke on Trent , where they are on display until 7 March .
Now , the collection of Anglo - Saxon treasures , discovered in a field near Lichfield last July – probably the most important find ever from the era and of national and international significance – will stay in the region as the centrepiece of a new West Midlands heritage trail , celebrating the ancient kingdom of Mercia .
But first they have to be bought for the nation .
In January , a public appeal was launched by the Art Fund on behalf of the two museums to raise £ 3.3 m to purchase the hoard .
The money will go to the metal detectorist and the farmer who discovered the haul .
There is very little doubt that the money will be raised – £ 60,000 has already come through public donations , while the two museums have contributed £ 100,000 each .
Once the hoard is secured , it will be on permanent display at the two museums .
The planned heritage trail would run between the two main museums but may also possibly take in the site where the hoard was found – a field near the town of Burntwood .
The trail would also encompass nearby Tamworth , where a Norman castle sits on what was once the seat of the kings of Mercia , the Anglo - Saxon kingdom that occupied the middle part of England and Lichfield , its religious centre .
Rita McLean , head of museums and heritage at Birmingham city council , says : " We are confident this would become a major tourist attraction , allowing visitors to learn not just about the hoard itself , but also about the historical background and the area from which it originates . ''
Experts are still debating the exact nature of the hoard , which consists of more than 1,500 gold and silver objects dating from the late 6th or early 7th century , from between the reigns of the two famous kings of Mercia , Penda and Offa .
Since they are overwhelmingly military in nature – with nothing resembling female jewellery – they are believed to be some kind of spoils of war , buried for later recovery .
Detailed study is expected to reveal much about the Anglo - Saxon ancestors of today 's Midlanders .

I really feel the debate on head shops is lacking a couple of vital insights which I think must be highlighted , particularly in light of the holier - than - thou organisations seeking to have them closed , lock , stock and barrel .
Firstly , the fact that head shops are opening at all indicates that there is a significant demand for such products , and it would be wise to acknowledge this .
People who wish to alter their minds -- be it with alcohol , herbs , or chemicals -- will always find someone to satisfy their needs .
It is clear to me that the clandestine culture of drug supply that has developed over the past decade or so has had an entirely negative social impact .
Drug users have become marginalised , while drug suppliers have become incredibly vicious and violent , to such an extent that they now , in some cases , pose a threat to the state .
I believe the State has a duty to acknowledge the wishes of a significant proportion of the citizenry who wish to experiment with these substances .
Taking control of the problem is far more effective than trying to wish it away .
Anecdotally , there has been a reduction in Dublin 's north inner city in the rate of contraband sold over the past few months , and surely this is to be welcomed ?
A proper and mature approach to this issue could improve thousands of lives , by taking substance abuse out of the underworld and into the plain light of day .
Information and assistance would be more readily available to those who experience difficulty , and organised crime would lose a major source of its income .
Further , the allure of such substances would be dulled by the fact that it was no longer a subversive act ; no longer a rebellious act to indulge .
That is a major factor in a lot of early drug use .
The wholesale banning of head shops as called for by those naive marchers will also have knock - on effects in society .
They are effectively calling for a Napoleonic code of law to be introduced , where substances can only be sold once granted a licence .
Thus , you can say without a shadow of a doubt that that will be the end of natural health stores , too .
I would call on those who would march against head shops to consider the opportunity we have here to bring huge numbers of our youth out of the underworld of drug dealing and allow them to make choices , for right or wrong , on what they put into their bodies .
For the most part they will do it anyway ; the only question is who supplies .

A top US Special Forces commander visited the village of Khataba in eastern Afghanistan today to apologize for a night raid that went terribly wrong .
It was here on Feb. 11 that a Special Forces team gunned down an Afghan police chief , a prosecutor , and three unarmed women , infuriating locals and drawing a sharp rebuke from politicians in Kabul .
Flanked by dozens of Afghan soldiers , Vice Adm. William McRaven , head of Joint Special Operations Command , spent an hour at the scene of the killings .
“ I am the commander of the men who accidentally killed your loved ones , ” Admiral McRaven told Haji Sharabuddin , the family patriarch .
“ I came here today to send my condolences to you and to your family and to your friends .
I also came today to ask your forgiveness for these terrible tragedies . ”
It was a remarkable turnabout for the US military , which for two months after the killings declined to say what units had been involved or otherwise take responsibility for the deaths .
Afghan investigators have claimed that Special Forces tried to cover up their involvement in the Afghanistan deaths , though that 's a charge the US has denied .
But Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the commander of US forces in Afghanistan , is grappling with a counterinsurgency ( COIN ) doctrine that calls for US troops , trained to be aggressive and assertive , to protect Afghans and win friends and allies that way .
Since taking command last year , General McChrystal has issued tighter rules of engagement and kept a constant stream of communication about the need to keep civilian casualties as low as possible .
In a video conference taking questions from troops earlier this year , McChrystal said with some frustration " we 've shot an amazing number of people " who were not , in fact , threats .
In February , McChrystal apologized to the Afghan people after a NATO airstrike killed 27 civilians .
Admiral McRaven gave his apologies in the same room where 25 relatives had gathered the night of Feb. 11 to celebrate the birth of a newborn child , shortly before the Special Forces raid took place .
NATO admitted responsibility for all five deaths for the first time on April 4 , paving the way for Thursday ’s visit .
Sheep offering
Arriving in a cavalcade of trucks and armored vehicles , three Afghan soldiers pinned down a sheep and held a blade to its throat in a traditional Afghan gesture seeking clemency .
Then an elder summoned them inside and McRaven offered his condolences .
“ Sir , I know that you are a good man and that your family are good people , ” he said .
“ We did not come here to any harm .
The American soldiers came here to protect the Afghan people , not to hurt them .
This was a terrible mistake . ”
“ Sir , you and I are very different , ” he said .
“ You are a family man with many children and many friends .
I am a soldier .
I have spent most of my career overseas , away from my family .
But I have children as well .
And my heart grieves for you . ”
Rising from among the dozens of soldiers and family members seated on the floor , Mr. Sharabuddin said he knew that “ foreign troops came to Afghanistan to help us , to protect us , to bring security ” and were “ not here to kill the civilians . ”
But , he said , justice would only be served when the Americans gave up the informant who sent the Special Forces squad to raid a house full of civilians and government officials .
“ We want that spy who gave the false information to the Americans , ” Mr. Sharabuddin said .
“ I do n’t want the spy for myself , I want him to face justice or be handed over to the commander of the [ Afghan army ] corps . ”
Commander Abdullah , a member of the provincial council of elders , warned US forces not to “ accept information too readily .
Because the enemies of Afghanistan are always trying to trick them this way …
During the 30 years of war in Afghanistan , everyone made some enemies , and everyone is trying to get their enemies killed like this . ”
After McRaven left , the conversation followed the same theme .
“ I ’m happy these people came here .
High - ranking generals came here , ” Sharabuddin said .
“ They used our tradition of bringing a sheep .
I ’m very happy … but I have n’t forgotten the spy . ”
Editor 's note : Roland S. Martin , a CNN political analyst , is a nationally syndicated columnist and author of " Listening to the Spirit Within : 50 Perspectives on Faith , " and the forthcoming book , " The First : President Barack Obama 's Road to the White House . "
He is a commentator for TV One Cable Network and host of a one - hour Sunday morning news show .
( CNN ) -- Civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer made famous the phrase , " I 'm sick and tired of being sick and tired . "
For me , I 'm sick and tired of Democrats having power and being unwilling to use it .
I 've always respected Republicans when they had power because they were willing to use it and maybe apologize later .
Today , President Obama walked into the White House briefing room and took some questions , and one of them revolved around recess appointments .
He has watched Republicans block many of his appointments , and now he says he made it clear to them that he will " consider " making some when the U.S. Senate goes into recess .
" One senator , as you all are aware , had put a hold on every single nominee that we had put forward due to a dispute over a couple of earmarks in his state , " President Obama said .
" In our meeting , I asked the congressional leadership to put a stop to these holds in which nominees for critical jobs are denied a vote for months .
Surely we can set aside partisanship and do what 's traditionally been done to confirm these nominations .
If the Senate does not act -- and I made this very clear -- if the Senate does not act to confirm these nominees , I will consider making several recess appointments during the upcoming recess , because we can't afford to allow politics to stand in the way of a well - functioning government . "
This is where the president needs to show his toughness and just do it .
Forget the threats .
The actions of Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Alabama , and other Republican obstructionists will continue if President Obama allows them to run roughshod over him .
When you 're the top dog , you do what you have to do to govern .
Allowing Republican senators to continue to deny your appointments is nonsense .
If all of them choose to support a filibuster , then you take it to the American people and show the obstructionists for what they are .
You get your grass - roots movement fired up to stand up and do something .
The political right used its base to go after Democrats who blocked appointments to the federal bench and other positions .
So why not be just as aggressive ?
If there are members of your own party who stand in the way , such as Sen .
Ben Nelson , D - Nebraska , then you also blast them and make them pay for acting so foolishly .
This president got rolled by the Senate over health care .
His team made some boneheaded mistakes , and now they are paying for them .
Continuing to play footsie with opponents will only get him into more trouble .
He should set a deadline to have his folks confirmed .
If not , appoint them all during the recess and go on about your business .
Obama 's critics keep blasting him for Chicago - style politics .
So , fine .
Channel your inner Al Capone and go gangsta against your foes .
Let 'em know that if they are n't with you , they are against you , and will pay the price .

Bowing to economic pressures , ABC News is launching a top - to - bottom restructuring that will shrink the staff by as much as 25 % and dramatically reorient the way it gathers and produces the news .
ABC News President David Westin laid out the plan in an e-mail to employees Tuesday , saying the network “ will undergo a fundamental transformation that will ultimately affect every corner of the enterprise . ”
The emphasis in the pared - down news division will be on “ digital journalists ” who can both produce and shoot their own stories , a model increasingly being adopted in television news .
Executives seek to cut between 300 and 400 staff members , about a quarter of the 1,400 - person news division .
All nonunion employees are being offered the opportunity to apply for voluntary buyouts , an unusual move that Westin backed as a way to cushion the dramatic changes in store .
If not enough staff seek to leave on their own , layoffs will follow .
The areas hit the hardest will be the special events staff , which will be disbanded , as well as the newsmagazines “ 20/20 " and “ Primetime , ” which will see many full - time employees replaced with freelancers .
The weekday and weekend staffs of “ World News ” and “ Good Morning America ” will be combined and the London bureau is expected to be substantially scaled back .
Westin said the cuts were not mandated by ABC ’s corporate parent , the Walt Disney Co. , but he concluded they were necessary during long - term strategy discussions that followed “ a very tough year financially . ”
“ We have managed to keep our heads above water financially but not by much , ” Westin said in an interview .
“ It was a sobering experience for all of us .
It made us think long and hard to make sure we have a successful and thriving future going out over the next five to 10 years . ”
The news division president said he “ would never want to pretend that this is going to be easy for anyone . ”
But , he added , technology offers the network the ability to generate the news more nimbly , without compromising quality .
With hand - held digital cameras , one or two people can now cover a story that once required a correspondent , producer and two - person crew .
Westin said the network ’s experience with its eight foreign correspondents who work as “ one - man bands ” persuaded him that the model produces strong journalism .
“ Nightline ” has also found success in paring costs by relying on producers who produce , shoot and edit stories , he said .
But after decades of a labor - heavy approach to newsgathering , it will not be easy for ABC to reinvent the process .
Camera operators and engineers are protected by union contracts , and will have to get leave from the union if they want to apply for the buyouts .
“ I do n’t see this is a light switch you flip , ” said Westin , adding that the news division would still retain some traditional approaches to news production .
Still , nearly all producers are going to be asked to be “ digitally fluent , ” he said , and the current practice of signing producers to contracts guaranteeing their employment will be reexamined on a “ case by case ” basis .
The changes are poised to be the most dramatic reshaping of ABC News since Roone Arledge revolutionized the division by recruiting a team of high - wattage anchors and launching new franchises during his 20 - year tenure as news president .
Staffers are not only fearful about losing their jobs , but are apprehensive about how the restructuring will affect their ability to chase big stories and swarm major news events if they remain .
Richard Wald , a former top ABC News executive who teaches journalism at Columbia University , called the size of the cut “ startling ” on its face .
“ But it is not a startling number when you consider the entire industry has changed , ” he said .
“ The wind is blowing all of these ships into a different kind of water . ”
Indeed , news organizations large and small have been forced to slash staff to cope with a drop in advertising revenue caused by the global economic slowdown and the siphoning of audiences by online media .
Last month , CBS News cut at least 90 positions , shuttering its Moscow bureau and significantly shrinking its staff in Washington , London and Los Angeles .
The industry - wide financial troubles have been felt keenly at ABC , whose flagship morning and evening newscasts remain in second place in the ratings behind NBC .
“ Good Morning America , ” the main revenue generator for the network , has fallen 10 % this season in the 25 - to 54 - year - old advertising demographic , though has seen a recent uptick with its new anchor team .

Reliable Identification of Bounded - length Viruses is NP - complete Diomidis Spinellis , Member , IEEE
Keywords : buffer - overflow , complexity , detection , identification , mutation , NP - complete , security , virus
Introduction
An often - used defence against computer viruses is the execution of an anti-virus program that detects and cleans programs that appear to be infected .
Virus writers respond to this defence by trying to thwart anti-virus software through targeted attacks , mutations , or social engineering .
Mutating viruses are a particularly insidious threat , because detection algorithms need to be constantly updated and to spend increasing processing time to identify new mutation types .
The question of whether complexity theory is on the side of virus writers or the protection vendors could have important practical implications .
In this paper we will prove that there exist realistic viruses whose reliable detection is of np- complete complexity 1 and that therefore the general problem of reliable bounded - length virus identification is np- complete .
Viral Software
Intentionally created malicious software 2 — often termed malware — is typically classified into Trojan horses , viruses , and worms 3 .
A Trojan horse is a program that exploits the rights of its user to perform an action its user does not intend , a virus is a Trojan horse that replicates itself by copying its code into other program files 4 , while a worm is an independently - running program that replicates through a network exploiting security weaknesses to invade other computers .
A number of virus prevention and detection methods have been proposed and are commonly implemented 5 , [ 6 ] .
Reference 7 contains an annotated bibliography of malware analysis and detection papers .
Prevention methods involve limiting the flow of information between programs through the use of appropriate hardware and software protection domains , coupled with self - defence mechanisms , instrumentation , and fault - tolerance .
Since the above methods will typically interfere with many legitimate operations ( such as the installation of new software or the correction of an existing version ) they need to be coordinated through carefully designed and executed security procedures .
Unfortunately current practice in system administration often renders these methods useless .
A large percentage of users typically administer their personal workstations on their own , in most cases exercising the full rights of the system administrator , without sufficient training and diligence .
Therefore , as a secondary line of defence , detection measures are often employed to locate virus instances and infections .
Two often used detection measures involve either the comparison of the system ’s programs against known - good versions ( typically condensed in the form of a checksum or a cryptographically secure signature 8 ) or the comparison of files against patterns of known viruses .
Since the first method depends on a known - clean system and can not be used to check software of unknown origin , the second , scanning , method is the one most commonly employed .
A number of software vendors provide virus - scanning software that can search new and existing system files for patterns of all known viruses .
The vendors regularly distribute updated versions of the virus patterns to keep the virus detection process up - to - date .
Virus writers however , have developed a series of countermeasures .
Even early academic examples of viral code were cleverly engineered to hinder the detection of the virus 9 .
Since the actual task of writing a virus is relatively simple 10 , [ 11 ] modern virus code focuses on employing platform independence , stealth , effective replication , and detection countermeasures .
Three pattern - matching detection countermeasures typically employed are the encryption of the virus body with a variable cryptographic key , the polymorphic generation of the decryption routine using equivalent code instructions , and , more recently , the metamorphic generation of the whole virus body through the addition , removal , permutation , and substitution of code sequences .
Viruses that employ these techniques , such as W32 / Simile 12 can be very difficult to identify .
In the following section we establish that reliably detecting instances of such viruses is a problem of np- complete complexity .
Identification Complexity
A virus is formally defined 13 by reference to a Turing Machine 14 \[\begin{array}{ll} M:( &S_M , I_M , O_M : S_M \times I_M \rightarrow I_M , \\ &N_M : S_M \times I_M \rightarrow S_M , D_M : S_M \ times I_M \rightarrow d) \\ \end{array}\ ] with a given set of states \ ( S_M\ ) , set of input symbols \ ( I_M\ ) , and maps \ ( ( O_M , N_M , D_M ) \ ) that , based on its current state \(s \in S_M\ ) and input symbol \ ( i \in I_M\ ) coming from a semi-infinite tape , determine : the output symbol \ ( o \ in I_M\ ) to write on the tape , the machine ’s next state \ ( s ' \ in S_M\ ) , and the tape ’s motion \(d \in \{ -1,0,1\}\ ) .
Given the machine \ ( M\ ) , a sequence of tape symbols \( v : v_i \ in I_M\ ) can be considered as a virus for that machine iff , processing the sequence \ ( v\ ) at time ( sequence point ) \ ( t\ ) implies that at a future time point \ ( t'\ ) a sequence \( v'\ ) — not overlapping with \ ( v\ ) — will exist on the tape , and that the sequence \ ( v'\ ) will have been written by \ ( M\ ) at a point \ ( t ''\ ) lying between \ ( t\ ) and \ ( t'\ ) :
\ [ \begin{array}{ll} \forall \ Box_M \ : \forall t \:\forall j :\\ \;\ ; S_M(t ) = S_{M_0} & \wedge \\ \;\; P_M (t ) = j & \wedge \\ \;\ ; \{ \Box_M(t , j ) \ldots \ Box_M (t , j + |v| - 1 ) \} = v & \ Rightarrow \\ \exists v' \:\exists j' \:\exists t' \:\exists t'' : \\ \;\ ; t < t'' < t' & \wedge \\ \;\ ; \{j ' \ldots j' + | v' |\} \cap \{j \ldots j + |v|\} = \emptyset & \wedge \\ \;\ ; \{ \Box_M (t' , j' ) \ldots \ Box_M ( t ' , j ' + |v'| - 1 ) \} = v' & \wedge \\ \;\ ; P_M ( t'') \ in \{j ' \ldots j' +|v'| - 1\} \end{array} \ ]
where
\ (t \in \ mathbb N\ ) stands for the number of times the machine has performed its basic operation — “ move ”
\( P_M(t ) \ in \ mathbb N\ ) represents the machine ’s tape cell position number at time \ ( t\ )
\( S_{M_0}\ ) is the machine ’s initial state
\( \Box_M (t , c ) \ in I_M\ ) represents the content of cell \ ( c\ ) at time \ ( t\ )
Note that in the original seminal reference 13 the above virus definition appears in the context of a viral set \( VS = ( M , V ) \ ) : a tuple consisting of a Turing Machine \ ( M\ ) and a set of symbol sequences \( V : v , v' \in V\ ) .
From the virus definition it is clear that the notion of a virus is intimately associated with its interpretation in a given context — environment .
It has been shown 13 that “ any self - replicating tape symbol sequence is a one element \( VS\ ) , that there are countably infinite \( VS\ ) s and non \( VS\ ) s , that machines exist for which all tape sequences are viruses and for which no tape sequences are viruses , and that any finite sequence of tape symbols is a virus with respect to some machine . ”
The same reference also proves that in the general case determining whether a given tuple \(( M , X ) : X_i \ in I_M\ ) is viral is an undecidable problem ( i.e. that there is no algorithm that can reliably detect all viruses ) through a reasoning similar to that employed to prove the undecidability of the Halting Problem 14 .
Other researchers have shown that there are also virus types ( viruses that evolve to contain an instance of the virus detection program ) that can not be detected by any error - free algorithm 15 .
As is often the case , current practice differs from theory .
Typical pattern based virus detection software scans a ( relatively ) known environment ( processor architecture and operating system ) to locate one of several ( thousands in practice ) a - priori known viruses .
In the following paragraphs we will therefore establish the complexity of the more restricted problem of locating an instance of a known finite length virus in a given execution environment .
For instance , the virus programs we provide in the appendices are only viral in the context of compilation and execution following the rules of Haskell and ansi C / posix , respectively .
The complexity of detecting a known fixed virus pattern of length \ ( M\ ) in a program of length \ ( N\ ) is harnessed by the Boyer - Moore string - searching algorithm 16 which never uses more than \ ( N+M\ ) steps and under many circumstances ( a small pattern and a large alphabet ) can use about \ ( N / M\ ) steps .
Unfortunately , as we saw in the previous section , virus writers are seldom thus accommodating ; fixed search patterns are not any more a viable virus detection method .
We will prove that the problem of reliably identifying a bounded - length mutating virus is np- complete .
Our proof is based on showing that a virus detector \ ( D\ ) for a certain virus strain \ ( V\ ) can be used to solve the satisfiability problem , which is known to be np- complete 17 .
( This approach works in the same way for any similar np - complete problem ; the satisfiability of the problem we are examining is not a special case . )
The virus \ ( V\ ) is a mutating self - replicating program .
We assume that the virus detector \ ( D\ ) can reliably determine in p-time whether a given candidate program \ ( C\ ) is a mutation of the virus \ ( V\ ) .
We will use the virus detector as an oracle for determining the satisfiability of an \ ( N\ ) - term boolean formula \ ( S\ ) of the following type : \[\begin{array}{lll} S = & ( x_{a_ { 1,1}} \vee x_{a_ { 1,2}} \vee
eg x_{a_ { 1,3}} \vee \ldots ) & \wedge \\ & (
eg x_{a_ { 2,1}} \vee x_{a_ { 2,2}} \vee
eg x_{a_ { 2,3}} \vee \ldots ) & \wedge \\ & ( x_{a_ { 3,1}} \ldots ) & \ wedge \\ & \vdots & \\ \end{array}\ ] \ [ 0 \leq a_{i , j} < N\ ] and thereby show that a p - time reliable virus detector is equivalent to a p- time solution to the satisfiability problem .
We will use the satisfiability formula \ ( S\ ) to create a virus archetype \ ( A\ ) and a possible instance of a virus phenotype \ ( P\ ) .
The virus is a triple \ [ ( f , s , c ) \ ] where
\ ( f\ ) is the virus processing and replication function
\ ( s\ ) is a boolean value indicating whether an instance of the virus has found a solution to \( S\ )
\ ( c\ ) is an integer encoding the candidate values for \( S\ )
The function \ ( f\ ) maps a triple \( (f , s , c ) \ ) into a new triple \( ( f , s ' , c ' ) \ ) and is defined as follows : \[ \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , {\rm if} c = 2 ^
N\ {\rm then} \ c\ {\rm else}\ c + 1 ) \]
Each \ ( S\ ) term \ ( x_n\ ) is calculated from \ ( c\ ) through the expression \[ \left\lfloor \ frac{c} {2^n} \right\rfloor \bmod 2 = 1 \ ]
A new generation of the virus is generated by applying \ ( f\ ) to the current generation .
Expressed in words , each new virus generation
evaluates \ ( S\ ) by extracting successive boolean value combinations from \ ( c\ ) increments \ ( c\ ) until it reaches \ ( 2^N\ ) passes the result of the \ ( S\ ) evaluation to the next generation
We can now ask \ ( D\ ) whether the virus archetype \ ( A\ ) \ [ ( f , {\rm False} , 0 ) \ ] will ever result in a virus mutation phenotype \ ( P\ ) \ [ ( f , {\rm True} , 2 ^ N ) \ ] that is whether one of the virus mutations will satisfy \ ( S\ ) .
We have thus proven that a reliable virus detector \ ( D\ ) operating in p- time can be used as a p- time satisfiability oracle and that therefore reliable virus detection is np- complete .
As an example for the operation of the virus consider the satisfiability of the formula \ ( S\ ) \ [ ( x_0 \vee x_1 ) \wedge
eg x_0 \ ]
The virus replication function \ ( f\ ) — after omitting for simplicity of expression the conditional , which only serves to limit the number of virus mutations — will be : \[ \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee ( x_0 \vee x_1 ) \wedge
eg x_0 , c + 1 ) \ ] the corresponding archetype \ ( A\ ) : \[( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee ( x_0 \vee x_1 ) \wedge
eg x_0 , c + 1 ) , {\rm F} , 0 ) \ ] and the phenotype \ ( P\ ) indicating satisfiability : \ [ ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee ( x_0 \vee x_1 ) \wedge
eg x_0 , c + 1 ) , {\rm T} , 4 ) \ ]
This particular virus will generate a mutation \ ( P\ ) — and thereby indicate that \ ( S\ ) is satisfiable — in four generations through the following sequence : \[\begin{array}{l@{}l} f f f f A & \rightarrow \\ f f f \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee ( x_0 \vee x_1 ) \wedge
eg x_0 , c + 1 ) \\ \;\ ; ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm F} , 0 ) & \stackrel{\beta}{\rightarrow} \\ f f f ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm F} \vee ( {\rm F} \vee {\rm F} ) \wedge
eg {\rm F} , 0 + 1 ) & \stackrel{\delta}{\rightarrow} \\ f f f ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm F} , 1 ) & \rightarrow \\ f f \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee ( x_0 \vee x_1 ) \wedge
eg x_0 , c + 1 ) \\ \;\ ; ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm F} , 1 ) & \stackrel{\beta}{\rightarrow} \\ f f ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm F} \vee ( {\rm T} \vee {\rm F} ) \wedge
eg {\rm T} , 1 + 1 ) & \stackrel{\delta}{\rightarrow} \\ f f ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm F} , 2 ) & \rightarrow \\ f \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee ( x_0 \vee x_1 ) \wedge
eg x_0 , c + 1 ) \\ \;\ ; ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm F} , 2 ) & \stackrel{\beta}{\rightarrow} \\ f ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm F} \vee ( {\rm F} \vee {\rm T} ) \wedge
eg {\rm F} , 2 + 1 ) & \stackrel{\delta}{\rightarrow} \\ f ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm T} , 3 ) & \rightarrow \\ \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee ( x_0 \vee x_1 ) \wedge
eg x_0 , c + 1 ) \\ \;\ ; ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm T} , 3 ) & \ stackrel{\beta}{\rightarrow} \\ ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm T} \vee ( {\rm T} \vee {\rm T} ) \wedge
eg {\rm T} , 3 + 1 ) & \stackrel{\delta}{\rightarrow} \\ ( \lambda ( f , s , c ) . ( f , s \vee S , c + 1 ) , {\rm T} , 4 ) \equiv P \end{array} \ ]
Implications
The creation of metamorphic viruses is a relatively recent phenomenon that places a considerable threat on our information system infrastructures .
From a theoretical point of view , the viruses bear remarkable similarities to the virus we have examined and the examples depicted in this paper ’s appendices .
Virus detection programs however need not be 100 % correct .
Users can tolerate the ( typically remote ) possibility of some “ noise ” ( false positives ) , because in practice it is quite rare for a non-viral program to match the detection pattern of a known virus .
As an example , a virus detector that detected this paper ’s viruses and also detected as a virus all triplets of the form \( (f , s , n ) : \ forall s \ \ forall n\ ) ( even cases where \( f\ ) is a non-satisfiable formula and \ ( s\ ) is true ) would probably be tolerated as a functioning “ good - enough ” virus detector , although strictly speaking it detects some false positives .
Such a virus detector can be implemented to terminate in linear time and is not np- complete .
Thus , given the difference between the theoretically perfect detection ( which is in the general case undecidable , and for known viruses , as we demonstrated , np- complete ) and the practically sufficient identification ( which is the basis for a number of working virus scanner implementations ) two questions arise .
How can the notion of “ sufficiently good detection ” be formalized in information theory terms ?
Can the increasing ability of metamorphic viruses to mutate move the identification threshold currently used by virus detection programs to the point where either numerous legitimate data sequences are falsely detected as viruses , or real viruses fail to be detected ?
An interesting phenomenon affecting the above topics concerns the currently permeable boundary between code and data .
Buffer overflow attacks 18 are based on data that overwrites a carelessly written program ’s return stack address lying at the end of a data buffer to cause the program to execute part of that data .
This renders all data files ( documents , images , music , video — many of them highly compressed ) stored on a computer potential carriers of viral code and dramatically increases the data a virus detector has to scan and discriminate .
Few viruses currently propagate through buffer overflows ; these weaknesses have traditionally been mainly exploited by worms and Trojan horses 19 .
However , once such viruses are released , the current virus detection approach will come under increasing strain , faced with the short pattern vectors of mutating viruses and orders of magnitude more data to scan ; as an example a 18 GB disk filled with mp3 files is likely to contain any 4 - byte ( virus ) pattern .
In the medium and long term , hardening our security defences and developing software , procedures , and work practices that will stem the spread of malware seem to be the only reasonable alternatives .
Virus Code in Haskell
The following code defines the virus replication function and the respective archetype and candidate phenotype , for determining the satisfiability of the expression \[ \label{egs} ( x_0 \vee x_3 \vee
eg x_4 ) \wedge (
eg x_1 \vee x_5 ) \wedge ( x _ 2 ) \ ]
The satisfiability function candidate values are encoded using Haskell ’s arbitrary precision integers .
module Virus where replicate :: ( replicate , Bool , Integer ) -> ( replicate , Bool , Integer ) replicate ( v , b , i ) = ( v , b || ( ( ( bit 0 i ) || ( bit 3 i ) || not ( bit 4 i ) ) && ( not ( bit 1 i ) || ( bit 5 i ) ) && ( ( bit 2 i ) ) ) , if i == 64 then i else i +
1 ) -- Extract bit b out of the Integer n bit :: Integer -> Integer ->
Bool bit b n = n `div` ( 2 ^ b ) `rem` 2 == 1 virus_archetype = ( replicate , False , 0 ) virus_phenotype = ( replicate , True , 64 )
Virus Code in C
The following code is the virus archetype , again for determining the satisfiability of the expression ( [ egs ] ) .
The satisfiability function candidate values are encoded as elements of the array x .
#include < stdio.h > # include < ctype.h > /*
Number of variables to satisfy */ # define N 6 int x [ N ] = { 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , } ; void advance ( void ) { int i , j ; for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i++ ) if ( x [ i ] == 0 ) { for ( j = 0 ; j < i ; j ++ ) x[j ] = 0 ; x[ i ] = 1 ; return ; } } void print_vector ( FILE * f ) { int i ; for ( i = 0 ; i < N ; i++) fprintf (f , " % c , " , x [ i ] ? ' 1 ' : ' 0 ' ) ; fputc ( '
' , f ) ; } main ( ) { char buff [ 1024 ] ; FILE * fi = fopen ( __FILE__ , " r " ) ; FILE * fo = fopen ( " new " __FILE__ , " w " ) ; if ( ( x [ 0 ] || x [ 3 ] || ! x [ 4 ] ) && ( ! x [ 1 ] || x [ 5 ] ) && ( x [ 2 ] ) ) fprintf ( fo , " /* Satisfied */
" ) ; advance ( ) ; while ( fgets ( buff , sizeof ( buff ) , fi ) ) if ( isdigit ( buff [ 0 ] ) ) print_vector ( fo ) ; else fputs ( buff , fo ) ; fclose ( fi ) ; fclose ( fo ) ; system ( " cc new " __FILE__ ) ; return 0 ; }
The candidate virus phenotype begins as follows :
/* Satisfied */ [...] int x [ N ] = { 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , } ;

Differing agendas ahead of talks India says three of its soldiers have been killed in clashes with militants in Indian - administered Kashmir .
Clashes began early on Tuesday morning in the Chinkipora area in Sopore town , 54 km ( 33 miles ) north of Srinagar city .
Indian border guards in Kashmir said they came under fire from Pakistan on Wednesday , a claim denied by Islamabad .
The two nuclear - armed neighbours are due to meet for talks in Delhi on Thursday - the first formal discussions since the 2008 Mumbai ( Bombay ) attacks .
The Kashmir dispute has been at the centre of decades of hostility between India and Pakistan and the cause of two of their three wars since independence from British rule in 1947 .
' Tough fight '
Thousands of Indian troops are fighting a two decade - old separatist insurgency in Kashmir .
The BBC's Altaf Hussain in Srinagar says these are the highest casualties suffered by Indian forces in an operation in the disputed territory so far this year .
Hundreds of thousands of troops are based in Kashmir A police officer told the BBC that the militants were armed with grenade launchers and other sophisticated weapons and were putting up a tough fight in Sopore .
Fighting continued until late on Tuesday and the military operation resumed on Wednesday morning , although there have been no reports of firing so far .
Wednesday 's shooting further south in Indian - administered Kashmir is alleged to have taken place in the Samba area .
" The firing from across the border started early morning .
A BSF [ Border Security Force ] personnel was injured , " Vinod Sharma , a spokesman for the border guards , told Reuters news agency .
Nadeem Raza , a spokesman for Pakistan 's paramilitary Rangers , told Reuters : " Our troops were not involved in any firing .
There may be some problem on their own side . "
Talks
The foreign secretaries of the two countries will meet on Thursday in the Indian capital .
SOUTIK BISWAS'S INDIA India and Pakistan are not two ordinary sparring neighbours - they are nuclear - armed estranged siblings with a history of three wars , brinkmanship and endless sniping
Read Soutik 's blog Correspondents say the talks could eventually pave the way for the resumption of the formal peace process broken off after the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which 174 people were killed , nine of them gunmen .
India says that the attacks were carried out by Pakistan - based militants .
There has been a spate of clashes in the past few months along the Line of Control that separates Indian - and Pakistani - administered Kashmir .
Pakistan wants to discuss a range of issues , including water and boundary disputes , as well as Kashmir .
But Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao said on Monday that Indian concerns about militant groups based in Pakistan would form the main focus of the talks with her Pakistani counterpart .

NAIROBI , Kenya —
In the remote northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo , a notorious group of rebels has laid claim to the title of most crazed and murderous in Africa , killing at least 321 civilians and kidnapping hundreds more during a methodical rolling four - day attack on a string of villages .
Regional military officials had largely written off the Lord ’s Resistance Army ( LRA ) , convinced that the rebel group , which first emerged in Uganda in 1987 , had been scattered into small ineffective units by a series of harassing assaults in late 2008 and early 2009 .
Over three months Ugandan and Congolese armies with U.S. support joined forces to hunt down the LRA and its elusive leader Joseph Kony .
It was said that the LRA ’s subsequent disarray made them a less lethal fighting force , no longer a threat to the stability of this fragile region , a borderless forested badlands where Congo , Central African Republic , Uganda and Southern Sudan blend into one another .
But the revelation this week by investigators from the New York - based advocacy organization Human Rights Watch of the scale and brutality of the December 2009 attack made it clear the LRA remain a force to be reckoned with , at least by helpless civilians .
It was the bloodiest attack in a while and went unreported for months because of the sheer remoteness of the territory .
Survivors in the Makombo area of Haut Uele district told of being tied up in human chains and marched through the forest , their fellow captives randomly
picked to have their heads smashed open with axes or to be hacked to death with machetes .
One witness who had fled to the nearby town of Niangara , where there is a small detachment of United Nations peacekeepers , known as MONUC , spoke of the “ stench of death ” that clung to his clothes and hung over his village for weeks following the attacks .
Most of the dead were men but amongst them were 13 women and 23 children , including a 3 - year - old girl who was burned to death .
“ The Makombo massacre is one of the worst ever committed by the LRA in its bloody 23 - year history , ” said Anneke Van Woudenberg , senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch .
“ The four - day rampage demonstrates that the LRA remains a serious threat to civilians and is not a spent force , as the Ugandan and Congolese governments claim . ”
Horrific as they are such attacks by the LRA are nothing new .
Kony , a Christian mystic from northern Uganda launched his rebellion in 1987 .
He wanted to force out Yoweri Museveni — himself a rebel leader who took power in 1986 and still leads Uganda 24 years later — and rule
the country according to the Ten Commandments .
Kony ’s rebellion soon turned maniacal .
Feeling betrayed by his own Acholi people , whom he accused of failing to adequately support him , Kony unleashed his forces on civilians in northern Uganda .
Soon child abduction , rape , murder , mutilation and pillage became the group ’s
signature style .
To pick just a couple of examples :
In 2004 , LRA fighters attacked Barlonyo , a camp of people made homeless by the war , and killed well over 300 ; in 1996 , a contingent of rebels raided a girls ’ school , kidnapping almost 140 to become sex slaves , fighters , porters and cooks .
The list goes miserably on year after year .
In 2005 , the LRA was pushed out of northern Uganda and soon afterward peace talks seemed to offer a chance of an end to the killing , but they finally petered out in April 2008 after Kony killed the deputy who had been attending the talks and stopped turning up .
Moves are being made to end the LRA scourge .
The International Criminal Court in The Hague has issued arrest warrants for Kony and some of his key lieutenants while in the United States a draft anti-LRA law was passed by the Senate in March .
The Lord ’s Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery
Act calls on President Barack Obama to help protect the region ’s civilians , stop Kony ’s attacks and help rebuild the areas damaged by the conflict .
In February , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations : “ I have been following the Lord ’s Resistance Army for more than 15 years .
I just do n't understand why we cannot end this scourge .
And we ’re going to do everything we can to
provide support we believe will enable us to do that . ”
In the past the U.S. has been willing to offer actions as well as words in trying to deal with the LRA .
Operation Lightning Thunder was launched in December 2008 with U.S. intelligence , air and logistical support to a joint Congolese - Ugandan fighting force .
The aim was to decapitate the LRA but the offensive failed to kill Kony and the LRA responded with deadly revenge attacks on Congolese civilians .
Hundreds more civilians died , hundreds more civilians were abducted .
Why not just kill Kony ?
Most observers agree that his death would mean the end of the LRA whose fighters would be lost without their charismatic leader , but it is not an easy thing to do .
In spite of their seemingly cowardly attacks on unarmed civilians , the LRA is an impressive fighting force , its skills honed during decades of fighting on the run in hostile environments .
A common suggestion is that some kind of jungle - ready special forces unit should be deployed to track and kill Kony , but that was attempted by the U.N. in 2006 .
In an LRA ambush , eight members of a Guatemalan special forces unit were killed by the very fighters they were hunting .

William Wallace Monument , Scotland
Current Pull - Up Numbers Workout Reps 1 - 5 50 6 - 10 75 11 - 15 100 16 - 20 150
One of my all - time favorite movies is Braveheart .
In case you 're unfamiliar with the story , it 's about the Scottish hero , William Wallace , who fought for freedom from the English .
While I wo n't vouch for the historical accuracy of the movie , it is a dramatic , entertaining tale of great physical prowess and the warrior way .
In one of the final scenes , as our hero is tortured ( including disembowelment and emasculation ) in defiance he shouts out freedom !!
The theme in the movie that 's always resonated with me is the hero 's continued quest for freedom from tyranny and oppression .
In my own life , I 've always rubbed wrong with authority and the status quo .
Consequently , I 've shunned the typical life path by becoming a full - time RV - er , which allows me a great deal of liberty in that I can pick up and go where -- and when - - ever I wish .
Like a nomadic Mongol , except I do n't travel with a horde !
A downside to this ( or upside , depending on your point of view ) is that I 'm unable to carry a lot of stuff but the few items I do keep with me are top-quality and highly functional .
My personal quest for freedom includes first - class workouts independent of gyms and health clubs .
As most of you probably know by now , I love training outdoors in beautiful , natural settings ; I find this utterly soul - soothing .
One of my favorite exercises is the pull - up .
I consider the pull - up a foundational movement for several reasons : A high strength - to - weight ratio provides major advantage in many sports , particularly in grappling .
In other news , studies have shown a high correlation between grip strength and longevity .
No matter what you do in life , strong hands and fingers are an asset -- and hanging from a horizontal bar is one of the best ways to get them !
The weight of the lower body pulling down upon the spine creates traction .
Even when I 've suffered from debilitating low - back injuries , I was still able to hang from a bar and do pull - ups .
The simple act of hanging , on its own , is very therapeutic .
If you 're physically weak , it 's very difficult to overcome a wall , scale a cliff , or climb through a high bedroom window - - all skills I 've had to employ through the years !
The pull - up does not lie !
For certain , if your numbers decrease , you can bet you 've gained some fat , lost some muscle -- or both .
I 'll say it again :
You never see fat boys doing pull - ups and people doing lots of pull - ups are never fat !
So our objective is clear : freedom to do our pull - up workouts outdoors -- and preferably in nature .
But where to find a decent pull up bar ?
Most gyms do n't even have decent pull - up bars !
Playgrounds are a good -- though unreliable - - source of pulling devices .
Some playgrounds have actual pull up bars or monkey bars that afford a pulling workout .
In California , I found plenty of pull up bars on playgrounds and in schoolyards but in many other states , a good outdoor pull - up bar is harder to sight than the elusive Sasquatch .
I 've used my trusty Lifeline Jungle Gym and even -- in a pinch -- tree limbs for a variety of pulling movements .
But what I 've needed is a dependable straight - bar for pull - ups and chin-ups ... enter the center - pull , pull - up system
The center - pull system is n't new .
Torque Athletic introduced one a few years ago , but the design was flawed .
Not only was it heavy and awkward , it was difficult to hang .
Their version also featured a rotating thick - bar on the handle which made gripping a real challenge .
This was touted as an advantage in that if you could master pulling yourself up on this rolling bar , it would improve your regular pull - ups .
I did n't find that to be true .
In fact , the weak point in pull - ups , for most people , is the grip and by making the grip more difficult , you 've further limited your limiting factor , thus lowering your pull - up efficiency .
But all that aside -- what do I mean by a center - pull , pull - up bar anyway ?
A center - pull , pull - up bar is hung by a rope or cable , from the middle of the bar , so that it teeter - totters back and forth .
This action forces you to pull evenly with your both right and left sides .
With a typical straight pull - up bar , likewise a barbell , you can compensate for a one - sided weakness , often without even knowing it .
Enter my new center - pull system by way of that mad , mad genius of the Carolinas , C.Ray !
C.Ray , a phenomenal martial artist and exercise nut , has been coming up with some amazing inventions out in the garage .
Rather than making the grip more difficult or treacherous , this bar diameter is absolutely perfect for good palm purchase and the bumpy , powder coat finish is sticky enough to provide adequate friction for the palms -- even in the rain !
This center - pull is much , more than just another pretty pull - up bar !
For one , it has straps -- similar to the Jungle Gym - - which clip onto metal carabiners , allowing you to do center - suspension dips .
If you think it 's hard to find an outdoor pull - up bar , try finding a decent set of dip bars !
The dip exercise is the perfect foil to the pull - up and many old - time great physical culturists considered it one of the finest exercises for all - around upper body development .
Certainly , gymasts are visible proof of the effectiveness of the pull - up / dip combination , as these movements form the mainstay of a gymnast 's exercise program .
This new center - pull system is a complete upper body gym .
With it , you can perform : Chin-UpsSuspended Push - UpsBody Weight RowsAb Roll - OutsPec
Flyesand even Leg Curls -- with the uniquely designed foot loopsPretty much any exercise you can do on rings , you can do with this , plus much , much more !
One of the best features is the ease in hanging .
Really , all you need is a tree limb or swing set and your workout is a go .
C. Ray designed a self - locking mechanism on the bar - - a little peg -- which is puro ingenioso !
No complicated knots required .
I find it much easier to hang up than even my Jungle Gym -- and even easier to take down again .
In touting this new system , you must understand something : I could have any system .
All the time , people send me things to test and try .
Further , there 's little out there I have n't already tried .
In fact , when I first received this thing , because of my negative experience with the Torque unit , I was somewhat skeptical .
Uncharacteristically , I left it laying there , in the box , for months .
I 'd had it shipped to maxwellsc but never bothered to test it out since at the time I had ready access to good pull - up bars .
Reluctantly , when I left Philly , I took it with me and noticed how easily it packed up with my other gear .
This was exactly what I 'd been looking for but it was n't until I arrived in San Diego that I began to put it to good use .
Though there were plenty pull - up bars around Mission Bay , where I was staying , getting to them involved running or biking a few miles .
The RV park had plenty of trees and most of the time I preferred to stay near my little home - on - wheels , putting myself through a good , old - fashioned butt kick without commuting .
It was at this time I came to truly appreciate to qualities of my center - pull system ... and even fell in love with it .
Now do n't get me wrong !
While this system is n't as difficult to master as the Torque bar , it 's still much harder than standard pull - ups and dips .
Do n't expect to get the same numbers you would get on a normal , straight bar .
What my system does best is allow you to perform some of the most productive upper body exercises anytime , any place , anywhere -- as long as there 's still a tree growing .
You might wonder how this center - pull system compares to the TRX and the answer is this system is superior .
The TRX does n't permit the most productive upper - body exercises ( at least effectively ) namely , pull - ups , chin-ups and dips .
Because the TRX strap attaches to an anchor strap , it 's very difficult to hang it high enough to effectively perform these three moves .
Additionally , the TRX straps are n't spaced wide enough to effectively utilize the wider grip necessary for vertical pulling and dips .
The split Jungle Gym does allow for various pulls and dips , since it can be spaced wide enough .
Hanging it high enough is n't a problem , as it hangs easily ... BUT getting it back down from that high spot is another thing , because you 've got to climb UP to get it back down .
With this center - pull system , all of these problems are eliminated .
( At this point in my diatribe , I asked my assistant , " should I give them a workout ? " and she said , " yes " so here it is .
What follows is an effective strength - endurance workout to build your pull - up numbers and give you the conditioning required to excel in all variety of sports -- and this will work whether or not you use a center - pull bar . ) 1 .
Do a max set of pull - ups .
Rest 60 - seconds .
2. Continue at the number you left off and do another max set .3 .
Do n't stop until you hit your workout target number .
4 .
Do this every other day for one month .
5 .
Take 4 days off and start again .
So , if you 're ever up in the area of the Olympic peninsula and you see a guy suspended from a strange bar hang from a tree limb , no , you 're not witnessing William Wallace 's latter - day disembowelment , it 's the Coach out there doing what he does best !

In Strength & Health , Steve
That “ normal ” is gone .
One way or another , a “ new normal ” will emerge to replace it .
Can we build a different , more sustainable economy to replace the one now in tatters ?
It ’s an uncomfortable idea , but one that cannot be ignored :
The “ normal ” late - 20 th century economy of seemingly endless growth actually emerged from an aberrant set of conditions that cannot be perpetuated .
In late 2009 , the economy showed some signs of renewed vigor .
Understandably , everyone wants it to get “ back to normal . ”
But here ’s a disturbing thought :
What if that is not possible ?
What if the goalposts have been moved , the rules rewritten , the game changed ?
What if the decades - long era of economic growth based on ever - increasing rates of resource extraction , manufacturing , and consumption is over , finished , and done ?
What if the economic conditions that all of us grew up expecting to continue practically forever were merely a blip on history ’s timeline ?
In 2008 the U.S. economy tripped down a steep , rocky slope .
Employment levels plummeted ; so did purchases of autos and other consumer goods .
Property values crashed ; foreclosure and bankruptcy rates bled .
For states , counties , cities , and towns ; for manufacturers , retailers , and middle - and low - income families , the consequences were — and continue to be — catastrophic .
Other nations were soon caught up in the undertow .
Let ’s be clear : I believe we are in for some very hard times .
The transitional period on our way toward a post - growth , equilibrium economy will prove to be the most challenging time any of us has ever lived through .
Nevertheless , I am convinced that we can survive this collective journey , and that if we make sound choices as families and communities , life can actually be better for us in the decades ahead than it was during the heady days of seemingly endless economic expansion .
Four Propositions
The following summary statements are fundamental both to grasping our current situation and managing our way toward a desirable future :
1 . We have reached the end of economic growth as we have known it .
The “ growth ” we are talking about consists of the expansion of the overall size of the economy ( with more people being served and more money changing hands ) and of the quantities of energy and material goods flowing through it .
The economic crisis that began in 2008 was both foreseeable and inevitable , and it marks a permanent , fundamental break from past decades — a period in which economists adopted the unrealistic view that perpetual economic growth is necessary and also possible to achieve .
As we will see , there are fundamental constraints to ongoing economic expansion , and the world is beginning to encounter those constraints .
This is not to say the U.S. or the world will never see another quarter or year of growth relative to the previous year .
Rather , the point is that when the bumps are averaged out , the general trend - line of the economy ( measured in terms of production and consumption of real goods ) will be level or downward rather than upward from now on .
2 . The basic factors that will inevitably shape whatever replaces the growth economy are knowable .
To survive and thrive for long , societies have to operate within the planet ’s budget of sustainably extractable resources .
This means that even if we do n’t know exactly what a desirable post - growth economy and lifestyle will look like , we know enough to begin working toward them .
3 . It is possible for economies to persist for centuries or millennia with no or minimal growth .
That is how most economies operated until recent times .
If billions of people ( cumulatively ) through countless generations lived without economic growth , we can do so as well — now and far into the future .
The end of growth does not mean the end of the world .
4 . Life in a non-growing economy can be fulfilling , interesting , and secure .
The absence of growth does not imply a lack of change or improvement .
Within a non-growing or equilibrium economy , there can still be a continuous development of practical skills , artistic expression , and technology .
In fact , some historians and social scientists argue that life in an equilibrium economy can be superior to life in a fast - growing economy : while growth creates opportunities for some , it also typically intensifies competition — there are big winners and big losers , and ( as in most boom towns ) the quality of relations within the community can suffer as a result .
Within a non-growing economy it is possible to maximize benefits and reduce factors leading to decay , but doing so will require pursuing appropriate goals : instead of more , we must strive for better ; rather than promoting increased economic activity for its own sake , we must emphasize whatever increases quality of life without stoking consumption .
One way to do this is to reinvent and redefine growth itself .
The transition to a no - growth economy ( or one in which growth is defined in a fundamentally different way ) is inevitable , but it will go much better if we plan for it rather than simply watching in dismay as institutions we have come to rely upon fail , and then try to improvise a survival strategy in their absence .
In effect , we have to create a desirable “ new normal ” that fits the constraints imposed by depleting natural resources .
Maintaining the “ old normal ” is not an option ; if we do not find new goals for ourselves and plan our transition from a growth - based economy to a healthy equilibrium economy , we will by default create a much less desirable “ new normal ” whose emergence we are already beginning to see in the forms of persistent high unemployment , a widening gap between rich and poor , and ever more frequent and worsening financial and environmental crises — all of which translate to profound distress for individuals , families , and communities .
Journey to a New Economy
The propositions described above are the starting points for a search that can be summarized in a single question :
What are the guideposts toward a livable , inviting post - growth society ?
This search has in many instances entailed a literal , geographic journey .
During the past few years , as I traveled the lecture circuit , I met thousands of people who had already concluded on their own that the global stage was being set for an economic crash of epic proportions .
They had passed through the psychological stages of grief — denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and acceptance .
They were thinking creatively , building new lives , and experimenting with a wide range of strategies for meeting basic human needs while using much less of just about everything .
Some of these folks , like me , had been thinking along these lines for a long time — since the 1970s .
Many were much younger , though , had learned about Peak Oil or climate change just within the past few years , and had recently decided to devote their lives to building a post - hydrocarbon world .
Some were clearly members of what was known in the 1970s as the “ counterculture . ”
Others were mainstream citizens — investment bankers , real estate sellers , high school teachers , small business owners , corporate middle managers — who had chanced upon information that awakened them forcibly from their routines .
Many of these folks lived in large cities , but others in small towns or on farms ; some were rich , some poor ( a few by choice ) ; some were devout , others agnostic or atheist ; some were working alone on survivalist projects , while others were building community organizations ; some saw the transition as a business opportunity while others were working through non-profit organizations .
Here are just three examples that stand out .
In 2005 , while on a lecture tour in Ireland , I met a young college teacher named Rob Hopkins who believed that life could be better without fossil fuels .
He had led his students in developing an “ Energy Descent Action Plan ” for their town , and believed he had the seed for something larger and more significant .
He soon moved back to his native England to earn his Ph.D. , and designed his thesis project around helping the village of Totnes begin a cooperative , phased process of transitioning away from its dependence on fossil fuels .
This project in turn led to the start of a series of Transition Initiatives in villages , towns , and neighborhoods throughout the U.K .
In 2007 , a version of Rob ’s written Ph.D. thesis was published as a book ( The Transition Handbook ) that quickly began inspiring others to take up this strategy .
Today there are hundreds of Transition Initiatives at various stages of development in a dozen countries ( including about 60 in the U.S. ) .
While in Montana for a speaking engagement at the University of Montana in Helena in spring 2009 , some local Peak Oil activists drove me to the town of Ronan and introduced me to Billie Lee , who had helped start Mission Mountain Food Enterprise Center .
The Center is housed in a fairly small , non-descript building and features medium - scale food processing equipment that local small food producers can rent at reasonable rates .
This enables small farmers to produce value - added products ( everything from canned soups to herbal tea bags ) that are profitable and are price - competitive with those made by industrial food companies located hundreds or thousands of miles from Ronan .
Local food has become an obsession for the sustainability - minded during the past few years , and local food systems will be a necessary pillar of post - growth economies .
Yet aspiring small - scale farmers often have a hard time getting started because they cannot afford the equipment to enable them to produce profitable value - added products .
Here in the tiny hamlet of Ronan was an ingenious solution to the problem , and one that deserves to be replicated in every agricultural county in the nation .
On a trip to New England in 2007 , I met Lynn Benander , a community energy activist and entrepreneur who had started a project called Co-op Power to bring renewable energy to low - income and multi-ethnic communities throughout the Northeast .
Typically , renewable energy projects cost more to get going than conventional coal or gas power projects , and so they tend to be found in wealthier communities and regions .
Conversely , the most polluting energy projects tend to be sited in or near poor neighborhoods or regions .
Co-op
Power aims to change that imbalance of power — in a way that any community can copy .
A typical project :
You help four people put up a solar hot water system and everyone comes to help you put up yours ; you save 40 to 50 percent off your total system price , get to know your neighbors , and learn how your system works .
Co-op Power had also pioneered a cooperative financing method that cuts through the usual roadblocks to renewable energy projects in poorer neighborhoods by leveraging member equity .
Individually , these initiatives and projects may seem to be on too small a scale to make much of a difference .
But multiplied by thousands , with examples in nearly every community , they represent a quiet yet powerful movement .
Few of these efforts have gained national media attention .
Most media commentators who address economic issues are focused on the prospects — positive or negative — of the existing growth - based economy .
These projects do n’t seem all that important within that framework of thinking .
But in the new context of the no - growth economy , they may mean the difference between ruinous poverty and happy sufficiency .
The trends are already in evidence : as the financial crisis worsens , more people are planting gardens , and seed companies working hard to keep up with the demand .
More young people are taking up farming now than in any recent decade .
In 2008 , more bicycles were sold in the U.S. than automobiles ( not good news for the struggling car companies , but great news for the climate ) .
And since the crisis started , Americans have been spending much less on non-essentials — repairing and re-using rather than replacing and adding .
Many economists assume these trends are short - term and that Americans will return to consumerism as economic crisis shifts into recovery .
But if there is no “ recovery ” in the usual sense , then these trends will only grow .
This is what the early adopters are assuming .
They believe that the nation and the world have turned a corner .
They understand something the media either ignore or deny .
They ’re betting on a future of local food systems , not global agribusiness ; of community credit co-ops rather than too - big - to - fail Wall Street megabanks ; of small - scale renewable energy projects , not a world - spanning system of fossil - fuel extraction , trade , and consumption .
A future in which we do for ourselves , share , and cooperate .
They ’re embarking on a life after growth .
* * *
The realization that growth is at an end raises many questions .
Will the financial impact be inflationary or deflationary ?
Will some nations fare better than others , leading to protectionist trade wars ?
Will the “ down - sizing ” of social and economic complexity lead also to a substantial die - off of the human species ?
How quickly will all of this happen ?
There simply are no hard and fast answers to such questions .
The financial , energy , food , transport , and political systems on which we rely are complex , so it is almost impossible to reliably model their response to a shock such as a resource limits - imposed end to economic growth .
The only reasonable response , it seems to me , is to act as if survival is possible , and to build resilience throughout society as quickly as can be , acting locally wherever there are individuals or groups with the understanding and wherewithal .
We must assume that a satisfactory , sustainable way of life is achievable in the absence of fossil fuels and conventional economic growth , and go about building it .

The government 's tough budget went unopposed by other parties Portugal 's credit rating has been downgraded from AA to AA - by leading credit rating agency Fitch over concerns about its high levels of debt .
Earlier this month , Portugal passed an austerity budget aimed at cutting its budget deficit .
The downgrade heightened concerns about the health of some of Europe 's heavily indebted economies , forcing the euro lower against the dollar and the pound .
The euro slid against the dollar to its lowest point since May 2009 .
It dropped 1.5 cents , or 1.1 % , to $ 1.3346 .
Against the pound , the euro fell 0.2 pence to 89.55 p .
The downgrade also sent major European stock markets into negative territory .
European impact " A sizeable fiscal shock against a backdrop of relative macroeconomic and structural weaknesses has reduced Portugal 's creditworthiness , " said Douglas Renwick from Fitch Ratings .
Although the agency said Portugal 's austerity budget was " credible " , it said the government would need " to implement sizeable consolidation measures from next year " , as well as reverse stimulus measures this year , in order to get its debt levels under control .
The Portuguese Minister of Finance , Teixeira dos Santos , said it was key to maintain efforts to cut the budget deficit in order to differentiate the country from Greece .
" I am worried because we know that markets overshoot sometimes in their reactions , " he said .
" The risk exists , I can not ignore that . "
The downgrade could mean Portugal has to pay higher yields on government bonds to attract investors , making it more expensive for the country to borrow money - even though other leading ratings agencies may not necessarily follow Fitch 's lead .
Analysts stressed the wider European impact the downgrade could have .
" The downgrade has more impact on the wider sovereign debt crisis , rather than on Portugal at the moment , " said Peter Chatwell at Credit Agricole .
There have been widespread concerns about the high levels of debt of a number of European countries , most notably Greece .
At the end of last year , Fitch and Standard & Poor 's , the second of the three major international credit ratings agencies , downgraded Greek government debt .
European leaders are currently discussing how best to deal with Greece 's debt crisis .

They flew in from California and Oregon , from Virginia and Boston .
They came with siblings and children ; our old quartet ’s cellist , Miriam , took her seat with 13 other family members .
They came because Mr. K. understood better than anyone the bond music creates among people who play it together .
Behind his bluster  and behind his wicked sense of humor and taste for Black Russians  that was his lesson all along .
He certainly learned it the hard way .
As a teenager during World War II , he endured two years in a German internment camp .
His wife died after a long battle with multiple sclerosis .
All those years while we whined that he was riding us too hard , he was raising his daughters and caring for his sick wife on his own .
Then his younger daughter Stephanie , a violin teacher , was murdered .
After she vanished in 1991 , he spent seven years searching for her , never giving up hope until the day her remains were found .
Yet the legacy he had left behind was pure joy .
You could see it in the faces of the audience when the curtain rose for the performance that afternoon .
You could hear it as his older daughter Melanie , her husband and their violinist children performed as a family .
You could feel it when the full orchestra , led by one of Mr. K. ’s protégés , poured itself into Tchaikovsky and Bach .
It powered us through the lost years , the lack of rehearsal time  less than two hours  and the stray notes from us rustier alums .
Afterward , Melanie took the stage to describe the proud father who waved like a maniac from a balcony in Carnegie Hall the first time she played there .
At the end of his life , when he was too ill to talk , she would bring her violin to his bedside and play for hours , letting the melodies speak for them both .
The bonds of music were as strong as ever .
In a way , this was Mr. K. ’s most enduring lesson  and one he had been teaching us since we were children .
Back when we were in high school , Mr. K. had arranged for Melanie and our quartet to play at the funeral of a classmate killed in a horrific car crash .
The boy had doted on his little sister , a violinist .
We were a reminder of how much he loved to listen to her play .
As the far - flung orchestra members arrived for Mr. K. ’s final concert , suddenly we saw her , that little girl , now grown , a professional musician herself .
She had never stopped thinking about her brother ’s funeral , she told me , and when she heard about this concert , she flew from Denver in the hope that she might find the musicians who played in his honor .
For 30 years , she had just wanted the chance to say , “ Thank you . ”
As did we all .
This morning , near Paris , French police arrested Agathe Habyarimana — the former first lady of Rwanda — on a seven - count international arrest warrant issued by the Rwandan government .
The charges : genocide , complicity in genocide , conspiracy to commit genocide , creation of a criminal gang , murder and conspiracy to commit murder , extermination , and public incitement to commit genocide .
Madame Agathe , as she was known in Rwanda when she had power there , has long been closely identified with the hard - core of Hutu Power extremists who planned and orchestrated the genocide of Rwanda ’s Tutsi minority in 1994 .
Le Clan de Madame , her court within the court , was known as the akazu — the little house .
The members of the akazu were the masterminds of the extermination campaign , and before , during , and after the killing they enjoyed the patronage and protection of France , whose role in the genocide was as unambiguous as its official denials over the years have been unconvincing .
When the slaughter broke out , after the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana , in April of 1994 , French soldiers whisked Agathe Habyarimana into exile , and for the past decade she has lived unbothered in France — although French courts have consistently denied her bid for political asylum , on account of her reputation as the Lady Macbeth of the Rwandan genocide .
Rather than owning up to its disgraceful past in Rwanda , successive French governments have always — until now — preferred to accuse Rwanda ’s post - genocide government of having instigated the genocide , when in reality it brought it to a halt .
That is what makes France ’s arrest of Madame Agathe such “ huge news ” — as a press officer for Rwanda ’s President Paul Kagame described it today .
When Rwanda issued the warrant for Madame Habyarimana ’s arrest , on October 19th last year — and delivered it to Interpol and to French authorities — Rwanda and France were officially in a state of diplomatic hostilities .
There had never been any love to lose between the two governments since 1994 , but the rupture came three years ago , when a French judge had accused President Kagame of assassinating President Habyarimana , and had indicted a number of Kagame ’s associates for the crime .
Kagame ’s response to the French indictments was to break off relations with France , and to prepare a series of reports showing how , in fact , the French political and military establishments had a great deal to answer for and a great deal to hide in their Rwandan pasts .
Beneath the legal and diplomatic combat , however , Kagame opened the back - channel contacts with President Sarkozy that led , late last year , to a restoration of relations and a reopening of embassies , followed , five days ago , by a visit to Rwanda by Sarkozy himself , making him the first French president to do so since the genocide .
( Listen to the press conference . )
French statesmen are not in the habit of travelling to small African countries that they used to run as puppet regimes to eat fistfuls of crow .
But that is precisely what Sarkozy did last week when he stood beside Kagame in Kigali and declared that France had made mistakes during the genocide , and had to reckon with them .
Afterwards , commentators made much of the fact that Sarkozy had not issued a full apology .
But in a country whose history is still bloodily contested , Sarkozy ’s frank acknowledgment of the truth of his former antagonist ’s reality sent an unmistakable message .
Without France ’s cover , the pretense that Rwanda ’s genocide is an open question is stripped barer than ever .
With this morning ’s arrest , we can see that France ’s change of attitude toward Rwanda was at least partly influenced by the facts presented in the case against Madame Habyarimana .
In November of last year , a pair of French judges went to Kigali to study the evidence assembled by Rwanda ’s Genocide Fugitives Tracking Unit .
Meanwhile the French case against Kagame ’s coterie appeared to be crumbling .
Whether France will extradite Madame Agathe to Rwanda remains to be seen .
She has already been released on bail .
But such is the warm mood between the two governments that Rwanda ’s prosecutor general , Martin Ngoga , declared today that he had every confidence in the French judiciary — a statement that was simply unimaginable from a Rwandan official six months ago .

Asilisaurus kongwe was a very close relative of the dinosaurs Scientists have discovered a dinosaur - like creature 10 million years older than the earliest known dinosaurs .
Asilisaurus kongwe is a newly discovered herbivore that lived during the middle Triassic period - about 245 million years ago .
The scientists say that its age suggests that dinosaurs were also on the Earth earlier than previously thought .
They described their findings in the journal Nature .
The study was led by Dr Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas at Austin in the US .
He said : " This new evidence suggests that [ dinosaurs ] were really only one of several large and distinct groups of animals that exploded in diversity in the Triassic period , including silesaurs [ like this one ] , pterosaurs , and several groups of crocodilian relatives . "
Dr Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History in the US was also involved in the study .
He said that this group of creatures - the silesaurs - were the " closest relative of the dinosaurs " .
" It was to dinosaurs much like chimps are to humans - kind of cousins , " he told BBC News .
Asilisaurus stood up to 1 m tall and walked on all fours " Since we have one line of the family tree , the other branch must have existed at the same time .
So this suggests there are other very early dinosaurs that we have n't found yet . "
He also said that the creature was not what the researchers expected an early dinosaur cousin to look like .
" It was a weird little creature , " he said .
" We always thought the earliest relatives were small , bipedal , carnivorous animals .
" These walked on four legs and had beaks and herbivore - like teeth . "
' Failed experiment ' Dr Paul Barrett , a palaeontologist from the Natural History Museum in London said that the finding provided scientists with important information about how dinosaurs evolved .
" The creatures share a lot of features with dinosaurs , " he said .
" They show us an intermediate step between more primitive reptiles and the more specialised dinosaurs . "
The fossil record indicates that this group of primitive creatures went extinct approximately 45 million years after they emerged .
The dinosaurs , on the other hand , were far more successful and walked the Earth for about 165 million years .
Dr Barrett said : " [ Silesaurids ] were like a failed experiment in how to build a dinosaur . "

Among those who quickly bought tickets on Wednesday was Steve Coats , a member of the Friends of Lincoln Center .
He ’s a theater director in Saratoga Springs , N.Y. , who is a fan of the Dostoyevsky novel and of the production ’s director , the German auteur Peter Stein , and an even bigger fan of what he called theater as an adventure .
Mr. Coats said on Thursday that he relished the idea of trekking out to Governors Island and testing his stamina with the marathon performance ( which will be broken up by meal and bathroom breaks ) .
In Mr. Coats ’s view “ The Demons ” will be a relief from the onslaught of films , music and television shows that clutter American culture .
“ This will be like going on an adventurous foreign trip without needing a passport , ” said Mr. Coats , who will attend with his wife , Alma Becker , a guest artist at Skidmore College .
“ We ’ve been to Berlin and just missed a Stein production there .
We were in Moscow and just missed Stein there .
Our colleagues and other theater people have spoken so highly of Stein , so we want in on the conversation . ”
Another ticketholder , Rajika Puri , a dancer and choreographer , said she yearned for theater and art that aspired to a fresh aesthetic , rather than the Broadway fare that rarely impresses her .
What makes New York important to her , she said , is the pleasures that can be found in taking a Saturday morning subway ride to a Lower Manhattan ferry and then walking to a warehouse that will be transformed for a dozen hours by 26 European actors and a director known for his uses of timing , perception and space .
“ I know my friends , and I will be asking each other : ‘ Are you going ?
And what did you think of it ? ’ because it ’s that sort of communal , unique experience , ” Ms. Puri said .
“ You talk about the play , about plays as literature , about the sets , about the ideas .
I look around me in those audiences and see people who crave being stimulated by art .
I do n’t want to be elitist , but the fact is there ’s an elitism to self - education . ”

“ The Demons ” is different from most other popular multihour shows like “ The Orphans ’ Home Cycle , ” now at the Signature Theater Company , and Tom Stoppard ’s “ Coast of Utopia ” at Lincoln Center Theater in 2006 - 7 , in that the Stein production will be performed only in its entirety ; those other two shows could be seen in parts or as a marathon .
Marathons tend to be the toughest ticket to come by , yet they also yield the mathematical impossibility of squaring the number of people who claim to have witnessed great cultural events with the number of seats available .
A software licence that was modified to become ' perpetual ' did not necessarily last forever and could be terminated , the High Court has ruled .
The term ' perpetual ' referred not to the fact that it was incapable of being brought to an end , but to the fact that it had an unlimited term so long as neither party chose to terminate it , the Court said .
Mr Justice Sales was presiding over a dispute between an animal feed maker and the publisher of a piece of software that it used to operate the milling of its feed .
BMS made MillMaster software and J Bibby , which later became AB Agri , was a customer .
They agreed a contract for the use of the software in 1994 , which gave AB Agri use of the software and tied it to a support agreement .
In 2000 they revised the software licence and support contract with a variation agreement .
It contained this clause : " The Program Licence will be extended to be a UK - wide perpetual licence . "
AB Agri gave the 12 months notice required in the contract to exit the agreement because it was developing its own milling software .
It wanted to be able to use the MillMaster software for archive purposes without continuing to pay for the ongoing technical support of the product .
AB Agri argued that this variation agreement replaced the clause in the previous contract which forced it to take BMS 's support services for as long as it used its software .
It said that this was not possible with a ' perpetual ' licence , ie one that could not be broken .
Therefore , it said , the new agreement supplanted that part of the old contract and it would have a continuing licence to use the software .
BMS disagreed and asked the High Court for a summary judgment on the meaning of the contract terms .
Mr Justice Sales allowed a summary judgment , ruling that the factual background and context to the contract , which would need a full hearing , were irrelevant .
" That evidence is inadmissible or irrelevant to the question of contractual construction before the court , " he said .
He had to decide , he said , which meaning of ' perpetual ' applied in this case .
" The word ' perpetual ' can carry different shades of meaning .
It can , for example , mean ' never ending ' ( in the sense of incapable of being brought to an end ) or it can mean ' operating without limit of time ' , " he said .
He said that the latter interpretation in this context would mean that the software licence went on without time limit until either party exercised its rights set out in the previous contract to terminate the agreement .
" I consider that this latter interpretation of the word ' perpetual ' in the context of … the Variation Agreement is the correct one .
On that interpretation … there is no incompatibility between … [ it and the ] Licence Agreement , " he said .
" Therefore , when the Defendant terminated the Support Agreement it also terminated the licence for it to use the MillMaster software . "
The judge said that the term ' perpetual ' in the new agreement was meant to refer to the licence from the old agreement , not to create a new one .
This meant , he said , that " the parties intended the licence referred to in ... the Variation Agreement to be subject to the same termination provisions as in the Licence Agreement .
" In light of these modifications to the licence terms , the best sense that can be given to ... the Variation Agreement is that the termination provisions governing the licence as set out in the Licence Agreement continue to operate , " he said .
He also said that if the variation agreement was meant to create a new licence , then it would have to have had its own termination clauses , otherwise the new contract would not have made commercial sense .
" The termination provisions in both those agreements were very important terms of those agreements , " said Mr Justice Sales .
" They dealt with important commercial matters such as termination for breach of the agreement or in circumstances of insolvency of the other party . "
" It is reasonable to think that any parties to licence and support agreements of this kind would wish such important commercial matters to be dealt with by such terms .
Accordingly , if the parties in this case had indeed intended that those provisions should be deleted , it is natural to suppose that they would have referred to them in terms to make that intention clear rather than leaving it to be inferred from the use of a term ( ' perpetual ' ) of uncertain meaning in the particular context in which it was used and a vague , unspecific provision like Clause 11 of the Variation Agreement , " he said .

Medical expenses include the premiums you pay for insurance that covers the expenses of medical care , and the amounts you pay for transportation to get medical care .
Medical expenses also include amounts paid for qualified long - term care services and limited amounts paid for any qualified long - term care insurance contract .
Medical care expenses must be primarily to alleviate or prevent a physical or mental disability or illness .
They do n't include expenses that are merely beneficial to general health , such as vitamins or a vacation .
Medical expenses are the costs of diagnosis , cure , mitigation , treatment , or prevention of disease , and for the purpose of affecting any part or function of the body .
These expenses include payments for legal medical services rendered by physicians , surgeons , dentists , and other medical practitioners .
They include the costs of equipment , supplies , and diagnostic devices needed for these purposes .
If you and your spouse live in a community property state and file separate returns or are registered domestic partners in Nevada , Washington , or California , any medical expenses paid out of community funds are divided equally .
Generally , each of you should include half the expenses .
If medical expenses are paid out of the separate funds of one individual , only the individual who paid the medical expenses can include them .
If you live in a community property state and are n't filing a joint return , see Pub.
555 , Community Property .
If you and your spouse live in a noncommunity property state and file separate returns , each of you can include only the medical expenses each actually paid .
Any medical expenses paid out of a joint checking account in which you and your spouse have the same interest are considered to have been paid equally by each of you , unless you can show otherwise .
You can't include medical expenses that were paid by insurance companies or other sources .
This is true whether the payments were made directly to you , to the patient , or to the provider of the medical services .
If you did n't claim a medical or dental expense that would have been deductible in an earlier year , you can file Form 1040 - X , Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return , to claim a refund for the year in which you overlooked the expense .
Do n't claim the expense on this year 's return .
Generally , a claim for refund must be filed within 3 years from the date the original return was filed or within 2 years from the time the tax was paid , whichever is later .
You can include only the medical and dental expenses you paid this year , but generally not payments for medical or dental care you will receive in a future year .
( But see Decedent under Whose Medical Expenses Can You Include , later , for an exception . )
This is not the rule for determining whether an expense can be reimbursed by a flexible spending arrangement ( FSA ) .
If you pay medical expenses by check , the day you mail or deliver the check generally is the date of payment .
If you use a " pay - by - phone " or " online " account to pay your medical expenses , the date reported on the statement of the financial institution showing when payment was made is the date of payment .
If you use a credit card , include medical expenses you charge to your credit card in the year the charge is made , not when you actually pay the amount charged .
Generally , you can deduct on Schedule A ( Form 1040 or 1040 - SR ) only the amount of your medical and dental expenses that is more than 7.5 % of your AGI .
If you paid medical expenses for your deceased spouse or dependent , include them as medical expenses on your Schedule A ( Form 1040 or 1040 - SR ) in the year paid , whether they are paid before or after the decedent 's death .
The expenses can be included if the person was your spouse or dependent either at the time the medical services were provided or at the time you paid the expenses .
What if you pay medical expenses of a deceased spouse or dependent ?
John properly filed his 2018 income tax return .
He died in 2019 with unpaid medical expenses of $ 1,500 from 2018 and $ 1,800 in 2019 .
If the expenses are paid within the 1 - year period , his survivor or personal representative can file an amended return for 2018 claiming a deduction based on the $ 1,500 medical expenses .
The $ 1,800 of medical expenses from 2019 can be included on the decedent 's final return for 2019 .
Form 1040 - X can be filed for the year or years the expenses are treated as paid , unless the period for claiming a refund has passed .
Generally , a claim for refund must be filed within 3 years of the date the original return was filed , or within 2 years from the time the tax was paid , whichever date is later .
What if the decedent 's return had been filed and the medical expenses were n't included ?
Qualified medical expenses paid before death by the decedent are n't deductible if paid with a tax - free distribution from any Archer MSA , Medicare Advantage MSA , or health savings account .
The survivor or personal representative of a decedent can choose to treat certain expenses paid by the decedent 's estate for the decedent 's medical care as paid by the decedent at the time the medical services were provided .
The expenses must be paid within the 1 - year period beginning with the day after the date of death .
If you are the survivor or personal representative making this choice , you must attach a statement to the decedent 's Form 1040 or 1040 - SR ( or the decedent 's amended return , Form 1040 - X ) saying that the expenses have n't been and wo n't be claimed on the estate tax return .
Medical expenses paid before death by the decedent are included in figuring any deduction for medical and dental expenses on the decedent 's final income tax return .
This includes expenses for the decedent 's spouse and dependents as well as for the decedent .
You and your three brothers each provide one - fourth of your mother 's total support .
Under a multiple support agreement , you treat your mother as your dependent .
You paid all of her medical expenses .
Your brothers repaid you for three - fourths of these expenses .
In figuring your medical expense deduction , you can include only one - fourth of your mother 's medical expenses .
Your brothers can't include any part of the expenses .
However , if you and your brothers share the nonmedical support items and you separately pay all of your mother 's medical expenses , you can include the unreimbursed amount you paid for her medical expenses in your medical expenses .
Any medical expenses paid by others who joined you in the agreement can't be included as medical expenses by anyone .
However , you can include the entire unreimbursed amount you paid for medical expenses .
If you are considered to have provided more than half of a qualifying relative 's support under a multiple support agreement , you can include medical expenses you pay for that person .
A multiple support agreement is used when two or more people provide more than half of a person 's support , but no one alone provides more than half .
For whom you provided over half of the support in 2019 .
But see Child of divorced or separated parents , earlier , Support claimed under a multiple support agreement next , and Kidnapped child under Qualifying Relative in Pub .

You may be able to take a credit for other expenses related to an adoption .
See the Instructions for Form 8839 , Qualified Adoption Expenses , for more information .
But if you pay the agency or other person for medical care that was provided and paid for before adoption negotiations began , you can't include them as medical expenses .
If you pay back an adoption agency or other persons for medical expenses they paid under an agreement with you , you are treated as having paid those expenses provided you clearly substantiate that the payment is directly attributable to the medical care of the child .
You can include medical expenses that you paid for a child before adoption if the child qualified as your dependent when the medical services were provided or when the expenses were paid .
A legally adopted child is treated as your own child .
This child includes a child lawfully placed with you for legal adoption .
Did n't provide over half of his or her own support for 2019 ; and

You , or your spouse if filing jointly , could be claimed as a dependent on someone else 's 2019 return .
He or she filed a joint return for 2019 ; or
He or she received gross income of $ 4,200 or more in 2019 ;
You can include medical expenses you paid for an individual that would have been your dependent except that :

If your qualifying child was adopted , see Exception for adopted child , later .
The person was a qualifying child ( defined later ) or a qualifying relative ( defined later ) .
You can include medical expenses you paid for your dependent .
For you to include these expenses , the person must have been your dependent either at the time the medical services were provided or at the time you paid the expenses .
A person generally qualifies as your dependent for purposes of the medical expense deduction if both of the following requirements are met .
This year , John paid medical expenses for his wife Louise , who died last year .
John married
Belle this year and they file a joint return .
Because John was married to Louise when she received the medical services , he can include those expenses in figuring his medical expense deduction for this year .
If Mary had paid the expenses , Bill could n't include Mary 's expenses on his separate return .
Mary would include the amounts she paid during the year on her separate return .
If they filed a joint return , the medical expenses both paid during the year would be used to figure their medical expense deduction .
Mary received medical treatment before she married Bill .
Bill paid for the treatment after they married .
Bill can include these expenses in figuring his medical expense deduction even if Bill and Mary file separate returns .
You can include medical expenses you paid for your spouse .
To include these expenses , you must have been married either at the time your spouse received the medical services or at the time you paid the medical expenses .

You can add these fees and tolls to your medical expenses whether you use actual expenses or the standard mileage rate .
Example .
In 2019 , Bill Jones drove 2,800 miles for medical reasons .
He spent $ 400 for gas , $ 30 for oil , and $ 100 for tolls and parking .
He wants to figure the amount he can include in medical expenses both ways to see which gives him the greater deduction .
He figures the actual expenses first .
He adds the $ 400 for gas , the $ 30 for oil , and the $ 100 for tolls and parking for a total of $ 530 .
He then figures the standard mileage amount .
He multiplies 2,800 miles by 20 cents a mile for a total of $ 560 .
He then adds the $ 100 tolls and parking for a total of $ 660 .
Bill includes the $ 660 of car expenses with his other medical expenses for the year because the $ 660 is more than the $ 530 he figured using actual expenses .

Greater Manchester police officers ' treatment of suspect was ' little short of torture ' , says judge
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Two policemen were jailed for 18 months today for inflicting " deliberate cruelty " on a 19 - year - old woman in custody in an incident described by a judge as a " little short of torture " .
PC Jason Hanvey , 37 , and Sergeant Andrew Kennedy , 51 , were said to have shown " appalling and inexcusable conduct " at a police station in Collyhurst , Greater Manchester .
CCTV from the station 's custody room caught Hanvey pressing Amy Keigher face down on a desk as he screamed : " Move and I 'll rip your fucking skull off . "
Hanvey grabbed her hair , pulled handcuffs over her head for more than a minute to fix her hands in a pain - inducing position , and then asked her to say " pretty please " to be released .
While Keigher sobbed in pain , Kennedy stood nearby showing " complete indifference " and appeared to condone Hanvey 's actions .
Sentencing the pair at Manchester crown court , Judge Anthony Gee QC told Hanvey , from Dukinfield , Greater Manchester , that his behaviour was " little short of torture " .
He added : " You took hold of her by the hair and brought her head down by the desk .
You brought the handcuffs over her head [ from behind ] while she sobbed and begged to be released .
" You held her in that cruel position for a very substantial period of time .
It was done to simply punish her under the guise of lawful restraint .
This was deliberate cruelty and quite appalling and inexcusable conduct , " he said .
The judge said to Kennedy that although Hanvey was the principle offender , he regarded his culpability " just as high " .
" You could , and should , have stopped what was happening ...
You allowed Hanvey to act in the way he did and moreover you appeared to approve what he did , " he said .
The incident began after Keigher was arrested in Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester in October 2008 .
What followed next was " outright thuggery " , said the judge .
Hanvey taunted Keigher , who was in handcuffs , that he earned more money than her and that she was on benefits .
She was then roughly held by the neck by an officer which caused her to complain the officers were " pathetic " .
Hanvey then began to manipulate her arms , the court heard .
The officers ' actions were brought to light after Keigher complained about her treatment and CCTV footage was reviewed .
Detectives passed the matter on to the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
The court heard Hanvey , who has now left the police , had a previous conviction in 1999 for assaulting a man at another police station in Manchester .
He was allowed to remain a serving officer after a disciplinary hearing treated the matter as a " one-off " .
Kennedy , of Atherton , Greater Manchester , retired after being convicted of failing to prevent such force .
Both men were found guilty of misconduct in a public office following a three - week trial last month .
Gee said the men had failed to show any remorse or regret .
" In the witness box you sought to justify what you did in what I regard as an arrogant fashion . "

Printer Friendly ... Compiler Optimizations for Reverse Engineers Author : RolfRolles # Views : 20648
I 've decided to release the part of my training material relating to compiler optimizations .
I created this back in January of 2007 ; for a while I was teaching classes very often , and so it made sense to keep it private .
Nowadays I only teach a few classes a year , and so this presentation is sort of languishing away on my hard drive , which is a shame since it 's my favorite part .
I think people will enjoy reading it , so I have decided to make it public .
Since I made this in early 2007 , it lacks some of GCC 4's optimizations , and from time to time I realize that I forgot an optimization or two .
But for the most part , it 's fairly complete .
If you have any specific suggestions for optimizations that I missed , please either email me or respond via comment with a link to a binary exhibiting said optimization and the address at which I can find it .
Proper compiler - theoretic names for the optimizations , if applicable , are also appreciated .
Here it is .
Enjoy .

Rolf ,
Thanks tremendously .
I really enjoyed reading through your slides and really appreciate the sharing of knowledge .
I just gave an RE primer to some co-workers and this is a great resource to talk about the challenges optimizations cause when REing .

A subject that is often ignored within discussions of who Christ is involves Covenant theology , specifically , the theology of the Torah .
How exactly does Christ relate to the Covenant that God made with the people of Israel ?
N. T. Wright discusses this very issue in his book , The Climax of the Covenant .
First , what is the Torah ?
The Torah , in Wright ’s usage , is not just the Mosaic books of the Bible or the Law , but the promise of God to His people , Israel .
The problem was , of course , that God demanded perfect obedience to the Torah , to the Law .
As His covenant people , Israel was to keep the Torah and to cherish it .
But Israel constantly strayed .
Thus , the power of the Torah became death , the consequence of sin ( 209 ) .
So how could Israel fulfill the Torah ?
The short answer is that Israel simply could not .
It demanded perfection , and the people of Israel could not be perfect .
God had to intervene directly in history in order to accomplish
His covenant with His people , and to open this covenant up to all people .
Finally , how could God keep this promise in light of the failure of Israel ( and mankind at large ) to keep the Torah ?
Christ , argues Wright , is the “ Climax ” of the covenant .
“ The Messiah is the fulfillment of the long purposes of Israel ’s God ” ( 241 ) .
How does this happen ?
Wright argues that the “ … answer must be that sin , by causing death , stood in the way of the divine intention of giving life ; when , on the cross , God condemns sin… then sin is powerless to prevent the gift of life ” ( 209 ) .
God ’s plan of salvation “ always involved a dramatic break , a cross and a resurrection written into the very fabric of history ” ( 241 , emphasis his ) .
Thus , Torah and Covenant Theology can be summed up by saying that “ Christ on the cross is thus the goal of the Torah ” ( 243 , emphasis his ) .
It is in Christ that we become the people of God .

In other studies by Goldin , women without children have about the same rates of name keeping .
Goldin has n’t repeated her study with more recent numbers .
And that means she has n’t examined the practice of Massachusetts women who , since 2004 , have married other women .
A study of Massachusetts birth records showed that only 13 percent of white , married , college - graduate women , age 30 to 34 , and having their first child in 2000 kept their given name , down from 17 percent in 1995 and 20.8 percent in 1990 .
( Name - hyphenators were a minuscule percent of the total . )
Claudia Goldin , the Harvard economics professor who coauthored the study , found that among 25 - to 29 - year - old white , married women with no college degree having their first child in 2000 , only 3.1 percent kept their given name after marriage ; it was 4.6 percent in 1995 and 4.3 percent in 1990 .
Black , married , college - graduate women , age 30 to 34 , having their first child between 1996 and 2000 , however , kept their names 34.2 percent of the time .
Goldin notes that black women without a college degree kept their names at about the same rate as college - educated black women .
Conventional wisdom holds that Del Genio ’s choice is typical for modern , heterosexual women who have a college degree and marry several years or more into a successful career .
But the truth is that a married woman who keeps her original name is rare , and getting rarer .
She did , however , plan on changing it when they had kids .
They had kids .
The name stayed .
She planned on changing it when the kids started school .
Kids started school , name stayed .
Eventually , she remembers , her husband said to her , “ ‘ Who are you kidding ?
You ’re never going to change your name . ’
In the end , I ’m glad I kept my name .
I like my name . ”
Growing up , Jessica Del Genio hated her last name .
Surrounded by Smiths and Robertsons and Mitchells , she felt her Italian surname branded her family as immigrants .
She could n’t wait until the day she got married and could change it .
But somewhere between her discontented youth and the day she married her husband ( who , although he did n’t want it used in this story , has a last name “ I would have killed for when I was a kid , ” she says ) , Del Genio developed a very successful business as a color and material stylist .
When the big day came in 2002 , Del Genio decided not to change her name , after all .
“ The primary reason I kept it was for professional reasons , ” says Del Genio , a 42 - year - old living in West Roxbury .
“ I ’m a specialist .
If I changed my name , people would be like ‘ Who ? ’ ”
As a woman who did it , I can honestly say that I ’m not sure .
I made the decision standing in line at Boston City Hall , filling out our marriage license application .
I did n’t realize until that moment that I would have to declare my name intentions on that document , and I felt ambushed .
I thought I ’d have time to figure it out once we got married .
So I punted .
My last name became my middle , and I took my husband ’s last name .
I still use my maiden name professionally -- it ’s my brand .
( Goldin says female journalists are among those most likely to keep their given name at marriage . )
I love my husband ’s last name , but after nearly seven years , it still does n’t feel like mine .
I do n’t use it very often .
If I had to do it over again , I would not have changed it , because it caused more headaches than it cured .
Even after I explain my situation , some clients continue to put the wrong name on paychecks and hotel and flight reservations .
My friends are never sure how to introduce me .
Name changing is a nice tradition .
I felt that my husband and I created a family unified under a single flag , but if I ’m brutally honest , changing my name made no sense for me .
But it made a lot of sense for Christine Valutkevich and her husband , Mark .
“ I did n’t ever consider not taking his name , ” says the 41 - year - old Hopkinton woman , who married in 2006 and has two daughters .
“ I felt it was one more concrete thing on paper that made us a couple . ”
Nor do some women who take a husband ’s name feel they ’re damaging the cause of feminism or having their identity subsumed .
“ I feel very confident that I am my own person , ” says 33 - year - old Patricia Sheedy of Boston , who has a Harvard MBA and married RJ in 2007 .
The couple have a son .
“ I do n’t see my name as my identity .
I see who I am as my identity , ” she says .
“ My name was just a label , and it did n’t bother me at all . ”
INSTEAD of killing off cancer cells with toxic drugs , scientists have discovered a molecular pathway that forces them to grow old and die .
Cancer cells spread and grow because they can divide indefinitely .
But a study in mice showed that blocking a cancer - causing gene called Skp2 forced cancer cells to go through an aging process known as senescence - the same process involved in ridding the body of cells damaged by sunlight .
If you block Skp2 in cancer cells , this process is triggered , Pier Paolo Pandolfi of Harvard Medical School in Boston and colleagues reported in the journal Nature .
And Takeda Pharmaceutical
Co's experimental cancer drug MLN4924 - already in early - stage clinical trials in people - appears to have the power to do just that , Dr Pandolfi said .
The finding may offer a new strategy for fighting cancer .
" What we discovered is if you damage cells , the cells have a built - in mechanism to put themselves out of business , " Dr Pandolfi said .
" They are stopped irreversibly from growing . "
For the study , the team used genetically altered mice that developed a form of prostate cancer .
In some of these , they inactivated the Skp2 gene .
When the mice reached six months of age , they found those with an inactive Skp2 gene did not develop tumours , while the other mice did .
When they analysed the tissues from lymph nodes and the prostate , they found many cells had started to age , and they also found a slow rate of cell division .
This was not the case in mice with normal Skp2 function .
They got a similar effect when they used the Skp2 - blocking drug MLN4924 in lab cultures of human prostate cancer cells .
To see if this would work in mice , they transplanted the cells and treated the mice with the drug .
" We put human cancer cells into mice .
We fed them with a drug and these cells do senesce ( age ) , " Dr Pandolfi said .
" The same mechanism of damage caused by the sun can be evoked pharmacologically in cancer cells . "
He said this Skp2 - related aging pathway appears to be active in cancer , and not other cells .
" We have no intention of ageing the patient ... only the cancer , " he said .
It 's unclear exactly what 's going on at the moment , but it appears that the PlayStation Network is down and causing a whole host of related problems for PS3 systems , including 8001050 F error codes , game crashes , corrupted trophy info , and even the complete inability to launch certain titles .
There 's no ETA on when things will get back to normal -- looks like it 's gonna be a Blu-ray kind of evening for PS3 owners out there .
Sony 's tweeted that it's " looking into it , " and our boys at Joy say that owners of original PS3s are seeing their clocks reset and even data loss in some cases .
We 'll keep you updated . :
Given that issues started to appear as February 28th became March 1st , it 's being speculated that the PSN woes are related to an improper handling of leap years .
Similar to the issue that bricked those Zunes back in 2008 .

Children of 10 should have at least 10 hours of sleep , experts say Pupils at schools in Glasgow are being given lessons in how to sleep .
The sessions , run by the charity Sleep Scotland , aim to teach pupils tips such as the importance of a bed - time routine and avoiding late - night television .
Experts say teenagers who seem grumpy and uncommunicative could actually be sleep deprived because they go to bed after midnight - even on week nights .
The advice for pupils is that they should be sleeping for more than nine hours a night .
Researchers found that after going to bed at 2300 or midnight , teenagers were staying awake for hours watching television , playing on games consoles , or browsing the internet .
Some pupils were getting as little as four or five hours sleep a night .
' Shocking '
One of the schools taking part in the project is Bellahouston Academy in south - west Glasgow .
Fiona Patterson , head of health and wellbeing , said the survey results were " absolutely shocking " .
" It does n't surprise .
They can't function on so little sleep , " she said .
I went to my bed at ten-ish rather than eleven , and I do feel a little bit more awake
Teenage boy Sleep Scotland says getting enough sleep boosts academic performance and sporting prowess .
However going without can be linked to obesity and a greater risk of depression .
Jane Ansell , director of Sleep Scotland , said : " You would n't send somebody to school without having the right amount of food , so why would you send them without enough sleep ? "
The charity hopes to use the pilot project to develop a pack which could then be offered to schools across Scotland .
Scotland 's largest teaching union , the EIS , have welcomed the study but say teachers already watch out for all aspects of their pupils ' welfare .
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said : " We are committed to providing guidance to young people so they can get the right amount of sleep and maximise their learning potential . "
One 15 - year - old who has attended the first of a series of sessions said he had tried going to bed early as a result of what he had been taught .
" I went to my bed at 10 - ish rather than 11 , and I do feel a little bit more awake , " he said .
" I was n't sleeping in French , as I usually do , " he added , " so my French teacher is pleased anyway . "

Of all the pictures I saw from the Iraqi elections last weekend , my favorite was on nytimes.com : an Iraqi expatriate mother , voting in Michigan , holding up her son to let him stuff her ballot into the box .
I loved that picture .
Being able to freely cast a ballot for the candidate of your choice is still unusual for Iraqis and for that entire region .
That mother seemed to be saying :
When I was a child , I never got to vote .
I want to live in a world where my child will always be able to .
God bless her .
This was a very good day for Iraq .
To say that mere voting or an election or two makes Iraq a success story would obviously be mistaken .
An election does not a democracy make  and Iraq ’s politicians still have yet to prove that they are up to governing , nation - building and both establishing and abiding by the rule of law .
But this election is a big deal because Iraqis  with the help of the U.N. , the U.S. military and the Obama team , particularly Vice President Joe Biden  overcame two huge obstacles .
They overcame an array of sectarian disputes that repeatedly threatened to derail this election .
And they came out to vote 
Shiites , Sunnis and Kurds  despite the bombs set off by Al Qaeda and the dead - end Baathists who desperately want to keep the democracy project in Iraq from succeeding .
This latter point is particularly crucial .
The only way Al Qaeda , Baathism and violent Islamism will truly be defeated is when Arabs and Muslims themselves  not us  show they are willing to fight and die for a more democratic , tolerant and progressive future .
Al Qaeda desperately wanted the U.S. project in Iraq to fail , but the Iraqi people just keep on keeping it alive .
And how about you , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran ?
How are you feeling today ?
Yes , I am sure you have your proxies in Iraq .
But I am also sure you know what some of your people are quietly saying : “ How come we Iranian - Persian - Shiites  who always viewed ourselves as superior to Iraqi - Arab - Shiites  can only vote for a handful of pre-chewed , pre-digested , ‘ approved ’ candidates from the supreme leader , while those lowly Iraqi Shiites , who have been hanging around with America for seven years , get to vote for whomever they want ? ”
Unlike in Tehran , Iraqis actually count the votes .
This will subtly fuel the discontent in Iran .
Brian Reynolds Myers is contributing editor to the Atlantic and professor of international studies at Dongseo University in Busan , South Korea .
In his new book , The Cleanest Race : How North Koreans See Themselves and Why it Matters , he examines North Korean propaganda meant for both internal and external consumption and through it constructs the closed country ’s view of itself , its relationship to other countries and the Kim dynasty that has controlled it for 60 years .
Colin Marshall originally conducted this conversation on the public radio program and podcast The Marketplace of Ideas . [ MP3 ] [ iTunes link ]
It 's easy for a Westerner to get the impression that everything a North Korean citizen might see or read or hear , every piece of culture they might encounter — paintings , stories , sitcoms — is , in some way , propaganda .
How true is that notion ?
I think it is true .
Of course , the information cordon that used to isolate the country from the outside world has deteriorated steadily since the mid-1990s , when North Koreans began to leave the country to look for food .
You have a lot of people who are smuggling into the country things like South Korean DVDs or Chinese TV sets — even cellphones , which can be used to call people outside the country .
Average citizens now have some access to unorthodox sources of culture and information , but for the average North Korean on a daily basis , everything they encounter really is propaganda .
Is it all , in some sense , state - produced , or is it simply subject to the state 's sensibilities and thus going to conform to them ?
It is actually state - produced .
You could contrast it , say , to South Korea under the military dictatorships , when you did have private people creating culture which was then subject to very strict censorship .
In North Korea , on the other hand , everything is conceived by the party , so to speak commissioned by the party , and then it has to go through another rigorous censorship process anyway .
By the time it gets into the hands of individual citizens , the regime has made very sure that there 's nothing in there that contradicts the view it wants to spread .
One of the most fascinating angles you take in the book is to explore a somewhat unexplored facet of this , which is that the propaganda the North Korean state gives to its own people and the propaganda it designs for outside consumption are different , and substantially so .
What is the core of that difference ?
The main difference is that North Korea has always tried to convey the impression to the outside world that it is a kind of communist state which seeks integration into the world community , which is very fearful of its own security on the world stage , which wants nothing more than a peace treaty with the United States so that it can get back to its own business of improving the standard of living for its people .
Now , the impression given to the North Korean people themselves , the propaganda they get which most people in the outside world never really learn about , gives a very different impression : that North Korea is a country that will forever be hostile to the United States , which some day will wreak revenge on America — a country that is not afraid of any other country in the world .
Rather , the rest of the world is terrified of North Korea .
You can read books , for example , about North Korean diplomats barging in on U.N. officials , laying down the law , telling the U.N. what to do and so on .
In other worlds , North Korea 's depiction of itself is strikingly close to , say , the American right wing 's depiction of North Korea as a rogue state .

You mention the stories about North Korean officials that are read within the country .
How much of the culture that a North Korean consumes actually revolves around those that govern them ?
A lot of stories are , of course , about Kim Jong Il , about Kim Il Sung .
It 's odd , in a way , for a Westerner to read that so many stories one might read are about figures in the state .
Right , because that is really the way ideology is taught in North Korea .
North Korea 's ideology is , as I say in the book , a very , very crude and simple race - based nationalism .
The leader is praised for being the perfect embodiment of Koreanness , the perfect embodiment of ethnic virtues .
So the leader does not have to teach very much himself .
Instead , the people learn the official ideology by learning about the leader ; in other words , by reading these fantasy biographies or by reading these completely fictional stories about things the leader might have done while traveling around the country .
That is the way the regime gets the message across .
It 's fascinating because , if I 've read your book correctly , you say the North Korean people know a lot of these stories to be untrue — that 's how they approach them , as fiction about , say , what Kim Il Sung did in his youth — but nevertheless , they treat it as , in a sense , true .
As I say in the book , you can perhaps compare this to non-biblical tales of Jesus .
I grew up in a Christian family , and at Christmas time , or when you read children 's books , you do find stories about Jesus which are not in the Bible .
You know — or your parents know , as they 're giving you these stories to read — that they 're not grounded in the Bible , and therefore , in all likelihood , they are simply products of the imagination of a writer .
But the important thing is that these stories be true to the essence of Jesus .
This is how the North Koreans approach those stories .
When they read a story about Kim Jong
Il having visited , I do n't know , a fishery or a shoe factory , they know that they 're not true , but they believe the essence of Kim Jong
Il is properly reflected in the story .
To go back a little bit to a point you made about the race - based nationalism of North Korea , this is not something much talked about , I find , even in material about the ideology of North Korea .
Why have so few before you focused on the specific racial element of North Korean ideology ?
It 's an undiplomatic point to make , but the inconvenient truth is that most North Korea - watchers in the United States do n't speak Korean and do n't read Korean .
They 're not able to read even the legend on a North Korean propaganda poster .
So they , for decades , have had to depend on secondary sources of information , primarily in English .
When they read North Korean materials , they have to read the so - called Juche Thought , because the regime has been careful to put this pseudo - ideology , this sham ideology , into English .
So when foreigners want to read about North Korean ideology , they have to turn to these books on Juche thought , which really decoy them away from the true ideology .
Juche
Thought is a jumble of humanist cliches like “ Man is the master of all things . ”
This fake doctrine has absolutely no bearing on North Korean policymaking .
While people are wasting their time trying to make sense of Juche Thought , the regime is propagating this race - based nationalism .
Another problem we have in the United States , a little bit , is political correctness , inasmuch as we are uncomfortable attributing racist views to non-white people .
It seems , in the book , you talk about it as designed to be un - figure - outable , to an extent , just kind of a vortex someone hopeful to understand North Korea in the West can fall into and fail to figure out ?
That is exactly what the point is .
The regime does not want to confuse its own people either , by having two ideologies on the intellectual marketplace , so to speak .
It deliberately writes this Juche Thought in as unreadable , as repetitive and as dull as way as possible so that nobody actually bothers slogging through it .
If you talk to your North Korean minders and guides and people like that when you go to North Korea , they know as little about Juche Thought as anybody else does .
Yet the outside world , even very respected Korea scholars like Bruce Cumings , have taken these Juche Thought claims at face value and simply concluded that Juche Thought is incomprehensible to a foreigner .
In face , it 's incomprehensible to the North Koreans too , but it serves its function very well .
The main function of Juche is to enable the claim that Kim Il Sung is a great thinker , that he 's just as great a thinker as Mao Tse Tung was .
In that sense , it has been a success .
I was going to ask you about that line in the book about how , if you ask your minders in North Korea , they 'll be confused and try to sort of hedge the issue .
Do you speak from experience there ?
What do they say back to you ?
The last time I was in North Korea was in 2008 .
I went to visit the city of Kaesong , which is near the DMZ .
I got into a conversation with my minder — they 're always very curious when a white man is able to speak Korean — and I started to talk to him about Juche Thought .
At first he was very proud and very pleased that I had heard about Juche Thought , but as soon as he realized that I had actually read those texts and that I expected him to answer some questions about them , he said , “ Is n't it time for you to get back on your bus ? ”
He was very uncomfortable .
This is in stark contrast to what I experienced as a young man in East Germany , when I traveled from West Germany .
If you talked to a member of the communist party there , he was able to give you a pretty good summary of Marxism / Leninism .
He knew what he was talking about .
The North Koreans are able to tell you the race - based nationalism also very well .
It 's this fake ideology which they do n't understand either .
How accurate would it be for me to say that a lot of United States - based North Korea - watchers get confused by what they think of as the North Korean ideology not because it's too complicated for them to understand but because the real ideology is , in fact , so simple that they do n't believe that it could be the real ideology ?
Right .
That really is what I see .
When I talk to North Korea - watchers , they tend to find North Korean propaganda , the stuff that I 've spent the past five years researching , actually too ridiculous , too immature , too puerile to take seriously .
Instead , they believe that North Korea must be ruled by this incomprehensible Juche doctrine which we simply have n't figured out yet .
It 's a shame , really , because if you look at the history of North Korea , how it has acted over the decades , it has not behaved at all like a Stalinist country .
It has not behaved like any of our adversaries in the Cold War .
It is quite obvious that it has been impelled in its actions by something very different from Marxism / Leninism , and actually , the North Korean regime has taken all the fun out of it for me , in a sense , because it has recently deleted the word “ communism ” from the constitution .
The onus of proving that North Korea is a certain country is no longer on me ; it 's for those people who say this is a Marxist / Leninist country , a Stalinist country , to explain to the rest of us why they think so .
The evidence is just not there .
Indeed , it does n't seem like North Korea fits anywhere on the standard left - right political spectrum that , say , someone in the U.S. would think about .
Is that the case ?
If we have to posit it anywhere on the ideological spectrum , we have to say that it 's more of a far - right country .
This is a country with a race - based way of looking at the world .
It does have a command economy , but the far - right national defense states of the 1930s and 1940s , namely imperial Japan and Nazi Germany , also had a command economy .
It was perhaps not quite as extreme as the one you see in North Korea , but a command economy is by no means incompatible with a far - right state .
But we have to keep in mind that this left - right scale should really be envisioned more as a kind of circle .
In other words , the further you get to the extreme left , the closer you get to the extreme right .
I would see North Korea as being right there where the extreme right and the extreme left meet .
The fact of the military - first government , as they call it , would make people think as well of the far right .
When you hear that “ military , ” that 's kind of where your mind goes .
You write in the book of this military - first government being an installation of specifically the Kim Jong Il era .
Did it precede him at all , or was it literally the case that the military - first idea came after Kim Il Sung passed ?
It did come after he passed , although I think it was conceived maybe a year or two before Kim Il Sung died .
It was really a reaction to the economic crisis , and the North Korean regime must have see that crisis coming .
It started as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 , and by the early 1990s , when the Eastern bloc collapsed , China told North Korea that it would have to start paying hard currency for imports .
At that time , the regime knew that it would have to disassociate the leader from economic matters .
The logical way for them to do that in 1995 was to tell the people that the threat from the United States was now so big that their leader would not have time for economic matters anymore , that he would have to be a military - first leader and occupy himself completely with military issues .
The irony , of course , is that 1995 was actually the best time ever in relations between America and North Korea .
The agreed framework had just been signed , and economic aid from the United States was actually coming into the country .
It 's really ironical , because on the one hand Kim Jong
Il had to make the Americans believe that North Korea was ready to change , and at the same time Kim Jong Il was trying to whip up anti-Americanism on the home front .
I can't stress often enough that this military - first policy was not a reaction to , say , George W. Bush 's “ axis of evil ” reference , which I think was a very unfortunate reference myself , but it was by no means the things that pushed the North Koreans into this military - first policy .
This act that we 've talked about , the North Korean state having to balance projecting one image to their own people and projecting another image to the outside world .
What level of cognitive dissonance , for the North Korean public , are we currently at ?
How close is it getting to , say , an East German situation , where people would profess one belief but secretly believe whatever they wanted to about the rulers ?
There 's very little of that sort of cognitive dissonance in North Korea .
The conflict that exists exists between the externally oriented propaganda and the domestic propaganda .
The average North Korean citizen is not aware or particularly interested in what the regime says to the outside world , not least because the regime is using English or Spanish or foreign languages to convey that external - oriented propaganda .
Inside North Korea , you have very little disagreement with the basic official line .
Even the North Koreans who escape from the country — and they are very small in number , those who choose to stay outside North Korea — still subscribe broadly to this racially - based way of looking at the world .
They are still fans of Kim Il Sung , even if they think that Kim Jong Il is a bad man .
It 's extraordinary , really , that you do n't have intellectual opposition to the regime in North Korea .
We have very few refugees from North Korea who can be described as being political dissidents .
This surprising degree of actual support for the North Korean regime that you see on the part of the people — can we call it a function of how little outside information they get alone , or how well the propaganda functions internally ?
Is it that they can't get the outside stuff , or simply that the inside stuff is so powerful to them ?
I would say the inside stuff is so powerful to them ; that 's really the reason .
North Korea is a nationalist state , and nationalism is generally much more impervious to outside or conflicting sources of information than , say , Marxism / Leninism was .
You only need to look at South Korea , really .
South Korea is a completely open state where citizens can access news from around the world any time on the internet or through their media , and yet South Korea is the second most nationalist country in the world , North Korea being the first .
Nationalism , especially this kind of race - based nationalism which we see so little of in the rest of the world these days , is , psychologically speaking , an enormously appealing doctrine .
It is just as well suited to good economic times as to bad ones , because when things go well you can say it 's because your race is so great , and when things go badly you can blame them on foreigners .
This worldview gives every North Korean citizen a role to play in this sacred racial mission of kicking the Yankees out of South Korea and reunifying the peninsula .
And I do suppose we should get a little clearer on the specific nature of the race - based nationalism : Koreans , in this view , are the “ child race ” who are so pure - blooded and so virtuous that they have to be protected from the evil world that surrounds them , specifically by the likes of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il .
Does that about get it ?
That is pretty much the ideology .
As I say , it 's something that a nine - year - old child in North Korea would have no difficulty understanding , so it 's a shame that , after having fought a war with North Korea and losing 54,000 Americans in the process , having come very close to fighting another war in 1993 and 1994 , our policymakers remain as ignorant of this very simple ideology as always .
Do the people of North Korea believe that the people of South Korea are essentially on an almost equal purity footing with them , and that they 're just another branch of the child race but have unfortunately fallen victim to the Americans ?
That 's what they believe .
Because the Korean people are racially , inherently good , it follows that the South Korean people are born just as good as the North Korean people are .
But the North Korean propaganda apparatus makes a lot of the contaminating influence of the American presence in South Korea , the contaminating influence of American morals .
The media in Pyongyang is also very critical of intermarriage between South Korean citizens and foreigners , especially between South Koreans and Americans .
The North Koreans believe that South Koreans ' racial purity is in danger .
One of the interesting things about the state media in North Korea 's view of the South is that they do not conceal the wealth of South Korea , which is just staggeringly greater than that of the North .
It 's revealed without the population hemorrhaging to the South .
How is that ?
It 's because they have a very good way of spinning that wealth .
The North Korean government says that the South Koreans are wealthy because Kim Jong
Il 's military - first policy has kept the Americans from launching another devastating war on the peninsula .
That 's one way in which they spin it , and they of course claim that the South Korean masses , for all their wealth , are deeply ashamed of living in a Yankee colony and want nothing more than to live under Kim Jong Il .
I think that line has been quite successful so far , but since the election of an anti-Pyongyang conservative South Korean president in 2007 , this propaganda line has come into some difficulties .
If the average South Korean wants nothing more than to live under Kim Jong Il , why then did he elect the anti-Pyongyang presidential candidate ?
This is something that the North Korean regime has had enormous problems with in the past two or three years .
I think the awareness is spreading in North Korea that the South Korean people are perfectly happy living in their own state .
I think it 's the North Korean regime 's efforts to counter that awareness which are behind these military provocations that we 've seen in the past year .
Is the greatest threat to the North Korean regime that exists not the U.S. , not the outside world , but this fact the South does not , in fact , want to live under Kim Jong Il ?
I believe so , yes , because North Korea has flouted the United States for decades now with impunity .
You can go back to the capture of the U.S.S. Pueblo in 1968 , the Pamunjom axe murders in the mid-1970s , and North Korea has really crossed every line in the sand that American has drawn in regard to the nuclear program .
I do n't believe the North Koreans are particularly afraid of the United States , and their own propaganda does not reflect any fear of the United States .
Rather , what the North Koreans are worried about is this rival state next door .
That 's always been problem number one for North Korea : how do you justify your existence as a separate Korean state when the state next door is thriving economically ?
I really do n't believe that the North Korean regime will ever feel completely secure until it has eliminated South Korea as a competitor .
And that does not seem particularly probable , does it ?
It does n't seem particularly probable , and I do n't believe that the regime thinks that it can invade South Korea and get away with it .
But I do believe that the regime wants to perhaps bully South Korea into some kind of power - sharing agreement .
These are things that I think are conceivable .
We know from North Korean refugees that they are building ever more tunnels to South Korea in order to make it easier to invade South Korea should the time come .
I do n't subscribe to the view that North Korea would never dream of invading South Korea .
I think it 's crazy enough to try it , and we need to be better prepared for that .
Part of the problem that I find with American policymakers is the belief that this is a Cold War kind of state , and we never had to worry about outright aggression during the late Cold War , and we do n't have to worry about it here .
I think a time may well come when North Korea really is so desperate , and has no other way in which to rally its people around it , that it will actually look for a military confrontation with South Korea .
The North Korean state , though , has to know that there 's simply no chance of ultimate victory with a military maneuver like that ?
I would n't be so sure .
If you look at our own president Bush , we went into that Iraq war in 2003 firmly convinced that the Iraqi people would come out and welcome us with open arms .
We believed this although we really had no evidence to speak of .
Now if you 're Kim Jong
Il sitting in Pyongyang , you have a lot of evidence that some South Korean people , or at least a significant part of the South Korean population , would welcome a North Korean invasion .
There are routinely opinion polls in South Korea which say that more South Koreans regard America as the number one enemy than regard North Korea as the numer one enemy .
In addition to that , you have the two southwestern Jeolla provinces where sympathy for North Korea is very strong .
It even extends to sympathy for Kim Jong Il himself .
What worries me , really , is that there is enough evidence on paper , at least , to make the North Korean leader , who is of course surrounded by yes - men anyway , to think that he might be able to get away this , that the South Koreans might indeed lack the will to fight .
There 's a line in the book that very much intrigued me , where you say that some South Koreans feel a twinge of guilt that the North is somewhat morally superior , or made the morally superior choice .
How widespread is that actual feeling ?
It 's not as widespread anymore , I think .
Ever since the conservative president Lee Myung Bak took power , that kind of sympathy for the North seems to be receding , because the news media have become much more critical under his rule than they were under the Sunshine Policy years from 1998 to 2007 .
But there is still a strong element of that .
South Koreans are also nationalists , and they have a sort of sneaking respect for this country to the north which has thumbed it nose at the rest of the world with impunity .
My own South Korean students at the university where I teach , many of them are quite happy that North Korea is pursuing a nuclear program , because they believe that , should unification ever come , those nuclear weapons would then become the possession of the Republic of Korea and Seoul .
This is probably the biggest issue to ask about , but how widely is it believed that unification is on the way , in the South ?
They do n't believe that it's on the way , and they like it that way .
The South Korean people really have no interest in reunifying the country .
Young people I talk to say they want it to happen some time in the future , but when I ask them when , they 'll say things like ten , 20 , 30 years in the future , which is really the same as saying they do n't want it at all , in my opinion .
I want to ask a bit about your own trips to North Korea .
How many times have you been ?
I 've been there twice , both for very short visits .
Unfortunately , it 's very difficult for an American who has been publishing routinely and quite critically about North Korea to get a visa to the country .
It 's becoming easier now for Americans to get into the country through certain tours that are associated with the Arirang Mass Games that take place in Pyongyang .
But my visits were to the Kŭmgangsan mountain resort and to the city of Kaesong , which is perhaps not as interesting to many foreigners as Pyongyang would be .
But I feel I know Pyongyang so well already from the propaganda materials I 've been studying that it was interesting to see an average North Korean city .
All of the regime 's resources are basically focused on Pyongyang , so if you want to see how most North Koreans are living , you 've got to get out of that city anyway and go to a city like Kaesong , which is really just crumbling .
It looks like a South Korean city must have looked in the 1960s .
Kaesong — correct me if I 'm wrong , but that region has a different set of economic policies that allow outside investment .
Am I right about that ?
There is what you call the Kaesong Industrial Zone , but that is a compound of South Korean factories which is located quite far outside the city of Kaesong itself .
That Kaesong Industrial Zone is right smack on the DMZ ; you go through the passport formalities and things like that , and then this Industrial Zone is pretty much right under your nose .
To go into the city of Kaesong itself , you 've got to take a bus for well over half an hour , 40 minutes .
The people who live in Kaesong itself are working in the same kinds of factories and collective enterprises as the people in the rest of the country , and as a result , of course , they are not earning a lot of money .
You can see , as soon as you enter the city , that people there are much , much shorter than they are in South Korea .
The average North Korean man is shorter than the average South Korean woman .
I do often hear , when people talk about having gone to North Korea , they will talk about having gone to Pyongyang and that it is something of a Potemkin village up there .
The scenes you describe , these are completely behind the props .
They actually let you see what is essentially really going on in the country , then ?
They drive you in the bus — they try to keep the buses going as fast as possible , of course — and a guide gets onto the bus as soon as you cross the DMZ , and the guide never stops talking .
He 's constantly trying to distract you from what you 're looking at outside the window .
You are taken to certain sites in Kaesong which are hidden from the street by a wall , but if you walk up the wall and look over it , as I did , you can see people going about their business on their bicycles , very cold , and the guides will always come over and try to get you away from the wall .
It really is a conflict for the North Koreans because , on the one hand , they want money from tourists , and they realize that tourists do n't just want to look at statues of Kim Il Sung .
On the other hand , they really are embarrassed to led the outside world see just how bad the conditions are there .
That word you mention , “ crumbling . ”
Whenever I 've seen a picture of North Korea , and they 're usually pictures of Pyongyang , the showcase city , even that appears to be crumbling or at least crumbly .
It 's sounds substantially more crumbly in a place like Kaesong .
We have to keep in mind that most of the buildings in cities like Pyongyang or around the country were build in the Soviet - subsidized heyday of the 1960s and 1970s .
These buildings are in desperate need of repair .
Many of them do n't have water pressure enough to convey water up to the top floors , so if people want to take a bath or a shower they have to come down to the ground floor and get buckets of water .
Many of the buildings — even in Pyongyang , as you say — lack windows and just have sheets of plastic over them .
The country really is in desperate need of money , and this is a problem for the government because it has recklessly , in my opinion , begun a propaganda campaign according to which the country will become strong and prosperous by the year 2012 .
That 's just not realistic .
The government is spending a lot of money on showcase projects , on putting new coats of paint on especially prominent buildings .
But I think it 's raising expectations in the minds of the people that they 're not going to be able to fill .
That 's dangerous , because the regime is going to look for some kind of diversionary military spectacle with which to inspire the people with pride .
To go a little further with the Potemkin Village metaphor , it is often read here in rumors about North Korea that , say , the Pyongyang subway does n't really work , that it 's full of actors who pretend to be on their way somewhere when , in fact , the lines are not operational .
Do we know that things like that are actually going on , or is that speculation ?
That sounds to me a little bit farfetched .
I do n't think the regime really can afford to have thousands and thousands of people simply standing around as extras on the off chance that a foreigner might come by and want to see the subway in operation .
I really do n't believe that .
Because so many resources are concentrated on Pyongyang , I do believe that they really are doing what they seem to be doing .
You were studying North Korea for quite some time before you visited , or did you visit and then begin studying it ?
No , I had been studying North Korea on and off since the late 1980s , and I never actually got around to visiting the country until 2003 .
The interesting thing is that it does n't really contradict what you 've read about .
There 's nothing in that country that conflicts with the image of the country that you get from reading propaganda .
If people want to understand the country better , they should n't be trying to find the “ real ” North Korea that is behind the propaganda .
It 's not as if there are two North Koreas there .
This is not like East Germany , where you had a first society of people paying lip service to Marxism / Leninism and then you would go to their homes and they would lock the doors and bring out their foreign books and their Beatles music and things like that .
It is n't that kind of a society , really .
There is a certain disagreement with the regime , but there is widespread consensus that the North Koreans really are the purest race in the world , and that the Americans really are inherently evil and so on .
How much useful information do you get as a scholar of North Korea by actually visiting the country , other to confirm that “ this is the place I 've read about ” ?
I would say very little , actually .
This is one of the reasons why I 'm not particularly intent on spending five or six thousand dollars every year to take a trip to Pyongyang to see the same sights that I 've seen so often and to hear the same speeches that I 've read about so often .
The problem in North Korea is that it 's virtually impossible to have unmonitored contact with North Korean citizens .
That would be more interesting for me , to find out just to what extent they believe everything , what things they disagree with .
But you 're never going to get that kind of contact with North Korean citizens , because somebody is pretty much stuck on you all the time .
It must be much more useful to talk to refugees from that country .
The problem with the refugees is that most of them come from the northeastern corner of the country , which is the poorest part .
So many of these refugees are from the least educated sector of that society , from the least propagandized sector of that society .
These are people who are not really accurate sources of information about how the official culture functions .
You could compare it to , say , a situation if you imagine all the people who left the United States were from Montana who had lived maybe three or four years in Canada before you got to them .
That 's the situation we have with these refugees .
They are North Koreans , true , but they 're not representative of the North Korean population as a whole .
They are from one part of the country , and they 've lived too long in the outside world before you get a chance to talk to them .
I want to go back to this fact that what you see in North Korea is not in conflict with what the propaganda says .
You write in the book that the North Korean state is actually quite careful to not contradict an average North Korean 's experience of their country .
That 's fascinating to me , because does that mean they can acknowledge any sort of way in which life in North Korea is bad , but can go back to , “ Well , America 's evil , and we 're pure ” ?
They can acknowledge a lot more than a Marxist / Leninist state could acknowledge .
They can acknowledge that South Korean people have a much higher standard of living .
On the other hand , there are things they really can't acknowledge precisely because of their racialism .
They cannot , for example , acknowledge the prevalence of crime in North Korea , because that is incompatible with the image of the Korean people as being uniquely pure .
If your read North Korean newspapers , there is no mention at all of any kind of crime in North Korea .
There are no real villains in North Korean popular culture either , because how could you have a North Korean villain ?
The kind of conflict you have in North Korean narratives is between a perfect character and a character who has perhaps some minor character flaws .
There is a lot that they can't talk about , but as I say , nationalism really goes with the grain of human nature .
We really want to believe that we are special and that the out group is bad .
The people are kind of working with the regime .
It 's not as if this is a very hard sell .
Those average North Korean citizens have no desire to find out they have been working their whole lives just to keep one family in Pyongyang happy .
That 's a truth , I think , that would devastate them , and they do n't want to find that out .
I was reading a book — it was actually more of a nonfiction graphic novel — by a Canadian animator who worked in North Korea for a while on some animation projects .
He was describing himself with his minder .
It occurred to him that he was looking around the streets of Pyongyang and did n't see any disabled people .
He turned to his minder and said , “ You know , there 's no one in a wheelchair or anything here , no one even on crutches , and on average , ten percent of the population will have some sort of physical disability . ”
The minder says , “ Yeah , but every North Korean is born perfectly healthy . ”
Is that a branch of this line of thought ?
Sure .
You can see this in Nazi Germany as well .
Whenever you have a state that professes belief in the purity of the race , you have a state that has a very hard time acknowledging the existence of people who are physically challenged or perhaps mentally handicapped .
The North Koreans do n't know even how to explain things like that .
Traditionally , Koreans on the peninsula for hundreds of years have had special problems acknowledging birth defects and things like that .
If you wanted to be a village elder in Confucian Korea , for example , you could n't even have a scar on your body .
This is why the North Korean regime had such a hard time with Kim Il Sung 's tumor .
For most of his adult life , Kim Il Sung had quite a sizable tumor on the back of his neck , and the North Korean propaganda apparatus had to photograph him from one angle so that this tumor would never be known to the North Korean population .
Right now , of course , Kim Jong
Il is increasingly infirm .
He 's probably not walking very well .
This is one reason why the people tend to see just still shots of him and not videos .
With the poverty among the North Korean people — I 've never read much about the state of medicine in North Korea , but considering the poverty of the country , I can't imagine it 's particularly effective — there must be a fairly high incidence of physical problems of various kinds .
That does n't contradict anything about how healthy they all are ?
Oh yeah , it does obviously contradict it .
One German aid worker I know worked in the medical field , and he said the conditions in the hospitals are just mind - boggling .
They 're using liquor bottles for IVs and stuff .
Of course , we can assume that there is a high degree of children born with birth defects .
We saw that in South Korea when South Korea was still a poor country .
But those people are probably kept at home .
Even if you go to South Korea , keep in mind , you 're not going to see very many physically challenged people on the street , because the shame that they feel is such that those people are usually kept at home .
In your book you describe five years of research in the Unification Ministry 's North Korean Information Center in Seoul .
How extensive an archive is that to work with ?
It is enormous .
It does n't go back as far as I wish it would .
If I want materials from the late 1940s and early 1950s , I 'm better off going to the National Archives in Washington , D.C. or going to the Library Congress .
But they are very good with up - to - date materials , and newspapers get there from Pyongyang maybe one week or two weeks late .
You can monitor North Korean propaganda in that way .
How many types of propaganda are available there ?
You talk about children 's books , you talk about various types of media .
It 's pretty much all there .
You can sit down with headphones and you can watch North Korean TV dramas , you can watch North Korean news broadcasts .
This is actually quite a new development , because for a long time it was completely illegal for a South Korean to access any kind of North Korean propaganda .
For a few years , you needed government approval to be able access this .
Now , the place is open to everybody .
Any South Korean high school student , for example , can just walk in there and start watching a North Korean movie .
Now what we do n't get , unfortunately , is the kind of propaganda that is disseminated at party meetings in North Korea .
These materials have been smuggled out occasionally , but we still do n't have regular access to them .
This is frustrating for me , because I 'm quite sure that the personality cult of Kim Jong Il 's successor is being propagated in these party meetings .
You talk about how a South Korean high school student could go in there and look at North Korean films or what have you .
How much did you see South Koreans making use of this resource ?
Unfortunately , not very often .
Whenever I got to the Resource Center , there 's a lot of free seats , a lot of elderly people there looking at the materials , a lot of academics looking at them .
I do n't sense any great interest on the part of the South Korean public as a whole , which is not surprising , really .
These materials are so thoroughly censored , so formulaic and conventionalized .
There 's no real conflict in North Korean narrative .
To a young South Korean who 's been raised on this very dynamic South Korean popular culture , the stuff is just deadly dull .
When you describe some of the plots of North Korean stories , of North Korean dramas , I imagine the experience , as you had , of sitting through them .
You were working hard for the fee on this book , it sounds like .
It 's dull reading .
I have a background n Soviet studies , and I remember Soviet literature , which I thought was very dull at the time but which was really exciting in comparison to the North Korean stuff .
I tried to vary it by accessing as many different sources of propaganda as possible : I would read women 's magazines , children 's magazines , children 's books , encyclopedia , dictionaries .
I would watch war movies and read women 's novels .
I just tried to vary it in that way , but always the same message is being conveyed .
With things like women 's magazines and children 's books — these are not what one would normally think of outside North Korea as a vehicle for propaganda .
Are any of these things reasonably propaganda - free , or is there some strain of it in all of them ?
Part of the problem now is that the North Korean government has to compete with these outside sources of information .
They know that people would rather watch a South Korean DVD when they get home than a North Korean movie , so they 're trying to make their own propaganda more accessible .
They 're toning down the overt propaganda in it .
You can find romances , for example , which are , I would say , 80 percent ideology free .
You find silly romantic farces about people trying to find a mate and meeting the wrong person and so on .
Some of this stuff is actually quite entertaining ; I 've shown it to my South Korean students and they laugh too .
But always there 's a propaganda message there at the end .
One of the interesting things you can find out from reading things like women 's magazines — you can get , indirectly , some kind of information on how things are changing in the country .
I read a women 's magazine recently which warned housewives against what they called “ the housewife disease , ” and if you read the description of the housewife disease , it 's quite obvious that they 're talking about an STD .
That article makes you realize that these diseases are spreading in North Korea , and this is something the regime is worried about .
That in turn makes you realize that certain social changes are underway as well .
These sources of information really are quite useful .
That is fascinating .
They 've bannered STDs as “ housewives ' disease ” ?
Right , they give the disease that name to make it sound more harmless , but when you look at the symptoms which are described in the article , it 's very clear what kind of diseases they 're referring to .
And of course , we are seeing a rise in prostitution in North Korea .
We are seeing a lot of women going back and forth across the border who are meeting , perhaps , Chinese men for liaisons .
These diseases are obviously becoming a problem for a country which lacks penicillin and lacks the medicines needed to treat them .
You talk about how the lack of skills with the Korean language , reading and speaking , which are no problem for you but stop a lot of other North Korea - watchers from truly understanding the country .
How hard is it beyond that to read between the lines in theis propaganda and get some genuine information like what you describe ?
It 's not hard to read between the lines with North Korea .
If you read Soviet newspapers — and I remember doing that back in the eighties , back during the Cold War — you had to read between the lines , because a lot of information was written in a cryptic way : information about which functionaries were on the way up and which functionaries were on the way down , for example .
But North Korean propaganda really is n't like that .
There are n't any hidden messages or coded messages in there , but occasionally you come across things like the articles about the diseases that I just mentioned , which give you an insight which perhaps the government in North Korea does not want you , as a foreigner , to have .
They'd be perfectly happy if no foreigners ever read their internal propaganda materials , I think .
At the point when you began this research into North Korean propaganda , could anything have surprised you about North Korea , given the amount of time and energy you 'd put into studying the country thus far ?
Did anything surprise you ?
What surprised me was a novel I read once about a courtesan , basically a geisha - type woman in medieval Korea .
I was surprised by that because it was a very , very raunchy story .
It spoke explicitly about sex .
There were jokes about male sexual organs and all that kind of thing .
That really did surprise me , and I refused to believe for a while that this novel really could have been bought and read by any North Korean .
I found out that I was wrong , that it really was quite a popular novel up there .
People explained it to me by saying that it 's okay to acknowledge sexual decadence if you attribute it to a time in the distant past .
So that surprised me , but generally speaking , I go back to the Resource Center in Seoul every few weeks to look at the materials there , and it 's pretty much what I expected .
The rise of kamikaze slogans , the rise of this sort of suicide campaign propaganda that I 've seen in the past few years was surprising to me , because it is so obviously derivative of Japanese propaganda during the Pacific War : all this talk about how everybody has to be ready to sacrifice their life for the leader .
That surprised me , the degree with which they were propagating that stuff .
And given the direction the country as a whole is going , that 's quite chilling , to see that start becoming a theme .
It is chilling .
I think that one of the reasons that Washington always puts North Korea on the back burner when the Middle East flares up is because Americans tend to think , “ Well , the Communists had nuclear weapons for decades ; they never actually used them .
These people do n't believe in an afterlife , so they 're not going to want to commit suicide through a nuclear war . ”
But if you look back at imperial Japan during the Pacific War , the Shinto religion does not have a very developed concept of an afterlife either , and yet thousands and thousands of people chose to commit suicide for the glory of the race .
They did so so that fame and glory would go to the family members they left behind .
We need to be aware that a similar dynamic could very well be at work in North Korea too .
You do n't need to believe in an afterlife to be ready to commit suicide .
Given that we 've talked so much about North Korea and that we 've also mentioned your study of the Soviet Union , I have to ask : how did your interests in what we might call closed societies like this develop ?
They developed when I was a high school student in South Africa .
I went to school in South Africa during the apartheid years , and every few days a teacher would come in and tell us more propaganda about apartheid .
That was a time when the government was setting up these so - called “ homelands ” for black people which were supposed to be independent countries : places like the Transkei and Bophuthatswana .
These homelands , basically glorified ghettoes for black people , were being presented as independent countries , and I was fascinated by the extent to which my classmates believed all this stuff and allowed themselves to be manipulated by what was very preposterous propaganda , in my view .
That 's what really made me interested in this sort of thing , and that 's what made me decide to study the Soviet Union as well .
Unfortunately , I got my MA in Soviet Studies a few months before the Berlin Wall came down and rendered that degree completely useless .
I had no choice but to start focusing on North Korea instead , which , at that time in the early 1990s , was just not a subject of much interest to people in the rest of the world .
Indeed , not just North Korea but the entirety of Korea at that time must have certainly been not a very popular subject for a Westerner to be studying — or am I wrong about that ?
No , you 're right .
When I was taking Korean Studies in Germany at the university , we had maybe 300 or 400 students studying Japanese , maybe 600 studying Chinese , and we had five or six studying Korean .
As a subject of interest , it still lags quite far behind Japan and China , but the peninsula is much more prominent on the world stage now than it was even ten years ago .
I do get feeling , though , that , especially in this last decade , the 2000s , interest in Korea , North and South has , if not exploded , then certainly grown to a surprising degree .
Have you also seen that ?
I 've seen that .
For North Korea , of course , it 's these provocative actions the regime has been undertaking that have put it on the map , so to speak , and with South Korea it 's the popularity of South Korean culture .
Not just in southeast Asia but also in America too ; I meet a lot of Americans now who have seen one or two Korean movies , and that would have been unthinkable ten years ago .
The country really does seem to be getting more and more prominent .

Fox Home Video held a global media day this week in honor of the April 22 release of Avatar on DVD and Blu-ray ( just four months after its theatrical premiere ) .
Journalists from all over the world were invited to check out scenes from the Blu-ray disc and talk with filmmaker James Cameron and producer Jon Landau about the process of putting it together .
At an airy mansion in the Hollywood Hills ( rumored to be owned by the creator of Rock Star energy drinks ) , a blue carpet led up to an open patio where a plushly furnished tent served as a temporary theater , complete with dark blue curtains , comfy black couches and potted greenery .
Cameron and Landau themselves hosted a presentation in which they showed off four clips from the film on a 103 " monitor ( flanked by two smaller 50 " screens on each side of the audience ) .
In his introduction , Cameron expressed his love for the " spectacular " Blu-ray format and explained that in order to keep the image quality as high as possible , no space was allotted on the disc for ads , promos or trailers .
It will just be " pure movie . "
" If you have to make room for a lot of other content it 's just going to degrade the image quality , " Cameron told the audience .
" That 's part of it .
Also , by the way , I have this kind of unwritten deal with Fox that anytime one of my movies makes more than a billion dollars we leave all the crap trailers off the disc .
It 's a little service we pass on to the viewer , because I can't stand watching them anymore than you can .
" The April 22 edition wo n't come with any special features either , although it will have a link to a portal where limited bonus content will be available .
A special edition will follow in November with more extensive extras , including behind - the - scenes and making - of content as well as additional scenes available via an interactive branching feature .
" I think what we can expect in terms of extras in November is a documentary that really chronicles the filmmaker 's journey through the four - plus - year odyssey of making this movie , " Landau told us .
" That really starts back from the inception of bringing on five artists to start working with us to start creating the world and culminates in the release of the film and what we went through there .
I think we can look towards a behind - the - scenes look at how some of the visual effects were done , and revealing some of that .
You know , going into the release of the movie , we felt that it was important to keep the wizard behind the curtain .
And not to talk before the release about how the movie was done and let people just go experience the movie .
I think the Blu-ray really affords the opportunity to delve deeper and give people choices about how they want to experience the film .
" Cameron and Landau explained the inspiration for the film 's April 22 release date , coinciding with the 40th anniversary of Earth Day and an initiative to plant one million trees all over the world .
" So many people have responded , and different groups and different causes that are attempting to deal with environmental issues and issues on indigenous rights have come to us and really seen Avatar as a kind of focusing lens for all of these issues , " Cameron said .
" And I think the public has really felt kind of an emotional outpouring around the movie for these issues .
So Earth Day is exactly the right time for us to premiere the discs . "
As we 've been hearing for months , 2010 is going to be a year of belt - tightening for NASA .
But it still has some cool technologies on the way : inflatable space stations , research into mid-orbit refueling , and new autonomous space vehicles .

Inflatable space station modules rank high on NASA 's wish list for an important reason : they 're cheap .
However , do n't let the price fool you .
Despite costing less , the modules can be larger than current models for the same weight , provide just as much protection , and even be tested with the currently deployed ISS .
Plus , private sector companies have already started developing the technology .
NASA also wants to automate many of the tasks currently performed by humans , essentially replacing the Space Shuttle with unmanned autonomous spacecraft .
This new budget dedicates money for a remote rendezvous and docking system , as well as an autonomous precision landing and hazard avoidance system .

And , like every American who 's getting hit at the gas pump , NASA wants to spend less on fuel .
In the new budget , they approach that problem in two ways .
The first is by paying for the development of an in - orbit refueling system .
This could significantly increase the lifespan of currently existing satellites , and save NASA the time and money required to launch a new mission every time something runs out of gas .
Additionally , NASA is allocating more funds to programs that would make fuel out of materials already found on the Moon and Mars .
By only having to bring half the fuel for the trip , and gassing up with material found at the destination , NASA hopes to significantly cut the cost of interplanetary exploration .
The new budget contains a number of other interesting programs , some of which seem like reactions to the new age of lower cash flow , and others that appear to signal a true coming of age in automation technology .
Either way , it 's as interesting as any 517 - page government report can be .

Popular Science is your wormhole to the future .
Reporting on what 's new and what 's next in science and technology , we deliver the future now .
Freddie Peacock of Rochester , New York , was convicted of rape in 1976 .
Last week he became the 250th person to be exonerated by DNA testing since 1989 .
According to a new report by the Innocence Project , those 250 prisoners served 3,160 years between them ; 17 spent time on death row .
Remarkably , 67 percent of them were convicted after 2000 — a decade after the onset of modern DNA testing .
The glaring question here is , How many more are there ?
Calculating the percentage of innocents now in prison is a tricky and controversial process .
The numerator itself is difficult enough to figure out .
The certainty of DNA testing means we can be positive the 250 cases listed in the Innocence Project report did n't commit the crimes for which they were convicted , and that number also continues to rise .
But there are hundreds of other cases in which convictions have been overturned due to a lack of evidence , recantation of eyewitness testimony , or police or prosecutorial misconduct , but for which there was no DNA evidence to establish definitive guilt or innocence .
Those were wrongful convictions in that there was n't sufficient evidence to establish reasonable doubt , but we can't be sure all the accused were factually innocent .
Most prosecutors fight requests for post - conviction DNA testing .
That means the discovery of wrongful convictions is limited by the time and resources available to the Innocence Project and similar legal aid organizations to fight for a test in court .
It 's notable that in one of the few jurisdictions where the district attorney is actively seeking out wrongful convictions —
Dallas County , Texas — the county by itself has seen more exonerations than all but a handful of individual states .
If prosecutors in other jurisdictions were to follow Dallas D.A. Craig Watkins ' lead , that 250 figure would be significantly higher .
If the numerator is tough to figure , the denominator is even more controversial .
One of the more farcical attempts at writing off the growing number of DNA exonerations came in a concurring opinion that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the 2005 case Kansas v. Marsh .
Scalia began by dismissing the idea that an innocent person may have been executed in America , explaining that if such a tragedy had occurred , " we would not have to hunt for it ; the innocent 's name would be shouted from the rooftops by the abolition lobby . "
Scalia has probably since become acquainted with the name Cameron Todd Willingham , the Texas man executed in 2004 who was likely innocent .
But the justice 's pique also betrays an unfamiliarity with how death penalty opposition organizations work .
While Scalia is right that proof of an executed innocent would be good rhetorical fodder for death penalty abolitionists , legal aid groups are n't about to waste their limited resources hunting down mistaken executions when there are living , breathing innocents still to be discovered .
Moreover , in many jurisdictions , prosecutors destroy the case files after an execution , making any post - execution investigation rather difficult .
That we do n't know for certain about more executed innocents does n't mean they have n't happened .
Scalia then cited some absurd math from Josh Marquis , an Oregon prosecutor who has held various executive positions for the National District Attorneys Association .
According to the Marquis formula Scalia endorsed , at the time there had been about 200 DNA exonerations .
For posterity , Marquis then arbitrarily multiplied that number by 10 , to come up with 2,000 wrongful convictions .
Marquis then took every single felony conviction over the previous 15 years as his denominator , to come up with a meager .027 wrongful conviction rate .
Move along , America .
Nothing to see here .
Your criminal justice system 's performing just fine .
The figure is absurd .
First , the subset of cases for which DNA testing can prove guilt is exceedingly small .
It 's generally limited to most rape and some murder cases .
You can throw out the entire body of drug charges and nearly all burglary , robbery , assault , and other classes of felonies .
As University of Michigan Law Professor Samuel L. Gross wrote of Marquis in a 2008 article ( PDF ) in the Annual Review of Law and Science , " By this logic , we could estimate the proportion of baseball players who 've used steroids by dividing the number of major league players who 've been caught by the total of all baseball players at all levels : major league , minor league , semipro , college and Little League — and maybe throwing in football and basketball players as well . "
If the aim is to calculate the percentage of people who claim they 're innocent and who actually are , you might throw out all cases decided by a guilty plea , too .
But this can also get tricky .
According to the Innocence Project , more than a quarter of DNA exonerations included a false confession or guilty plea .
The plea bargaining process can also induce innocent people to plead guilty to lesser crimes to avoid charges with more serious prison time , particularly in drug cases .
The Innocence Project cites a study by Seton Hall 's D. Michael Risinger that puts the percentage of innocents in prison at 3 to 5 percent .
But that study looked only at capital crimes , and there 's yet more debate over whether data gleaned from those accused of crimes that are eligible for the death penalty would translate into higher or lower wrongful conviction rates for those accused of lesser crimes .
( Those who argue that it would be higher note that there 's more pressure on prosecutors and jurors to hold someone accountable in murder cases .
On the other hand , defendants tend to have better representation in capital cases . )
But even dropping below the study 's floor , using the 2008 prison population , a 2 percent wrongful conviction rate would mean about 46,000 people incarcerated for crimes they did n't commit .
Whatever the percentage , DNA testing has exposed some gaping flaws in the system , calling into question traditional assumptions on the value of eyewitness testimony , forensic evidence , confessions , and the appeals process .
( In several cases in which a defendant was later exonerated by DNA testing , appeals courts not only upheld convictions , but noted the " overwhelming evidence " of the defendants ' guilt . )
Scalia stated in Marsh that an exoneration " demonstrates not the failure of the system but its success , " but it would be naive to believe the same systemic flaws exposed by these exonerations in the small subset of cases for which DNA testing is available do n't also exist in the much larger pool of non-DNA cases .
Put another way , if we now know because of DNA testing that misconduct by police and prosecutors produced a wrongful conviction in a high - profile murder case , it 's probably safe to assume that the same problems led to the wrongful conviction of a number of routine drug suspects over the years , too .
The difference is that there 's no test to clear those people 's names .
So these 250 DNA exonerations are n't proof that the system is working .
They 're a wake - up call that it is n't .
Instead of falling back on groups like the Innocence Project to serve as unofficial checks against wrongful convictions , lawmakers , judges , and law enforcement officials should be looking at why there 's so much work for these organizations in the first place .

Police forces in England and Wales are failing to take antisocial behaviour seriously and urgent action must be taken to improve understanding of the toll it takes on communities , the head of the police inspectorate has said .
The chief inspector of constabulary , Denis O'Connor , said police forces ' recording of information about harassment , criminal damage and verbal abuse was " inadequate " and must be improved immediately .
More than half the 43 forces in England and Wales could not automatically identify people who were repeat victims of antisocial behaviour , leaving police officers ignorant of vulnerable people in need of help .
Other damning results of a survey by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary ( HMIC ) included the finding that officers failed to turn up to almost one in four ( 23 % ) of complaints about antisocial behaviour .
The survey comes in the aftermath of the case of Fiona Pilkington , who killed her severely disabled 18 - year - old daughter and herself after they were ongoing victims of antisocial behaviour by gangs near their home in Leicestershire .
" I certainly think , on the basis of what we have got here , we should take antisocial behaviour seriously , " O'Connor said .
" Because one of the tests we do in the background is how does this impact in terms of crime ?
It is constant and in their face , personalised , and people like a sanctuary .
If they can not go home in peace , imagine how unnerving it is .
I think this undermines confidence if it is not dealt with seriously – confidence not just in the police , but in general . "
Sir Hugh Orde , president of the Association of Chief Police Officers , said forces faced " hard choices " in prioritising their time and needed to work better on securing responses to reports of antisocial behaviour from other agencies such as local councils and housing associations .
" There are certainly cases where we could , without question , do better , and every chief constable in the country will be talking about this today to their communities , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
" But you can't actually say we are only talking about antisocial behaviour because the police can't just focus on one thing , we have to deal with the whole complexity of policing from antisocial behaviour ... right through to organised crime and international terrorism because that 's what keeps communities safe in the totalities .
We have to make hard choices . "
O'Connor said antisocial behaviour was a deeply troubling issue for the public , but that there was no agreed framework among forces on how best to record and deal with it .
" An awful lot of police forces have real problems , " he said .
" There is a lot of it [ antisocial behaviour ] , a lot of it is under - reported and there is a problem with nailing the intelligence around it .
It is like going back to the doctor 's surgery but you see a difference doctor every time .
The more times they suffer , the less confidence people have .
There are some heartrending stories . "
The home secretary , Alan Johnson , said the government expected all local agencies to prioritise antisocial behaviour : " Antisocial behaviour is to be tackled not tolerated - police and other agencies must protect victims and punish perpetrators . "
But the shadow home secretary , Chris Grayling , blamed the prevalence of antisocial behaviour on " Labour 's culture of bureaucracy " which he said forced police officers to fill in " endless forms " and limited the time they spent on the streets .
Officials at HMIC have begun further research to draw up a framework to assess the performance of police forces in tackling antisocial behaviour .
The West Mercia assistant chief constable , Simon Edens , the national leader on tackling antisocial behaviour , said officers must work closely with councils , housing providers and parents .
" Chief officers recognise that what people want most for the community in which they live is to feel safe in the homes they live in , and on the streets they walk , " he added .
" We know that antisocial behaviour matters to the public and that the police service is the only 24 - hour , 365 day per year resource that the public can turn to .
Of the 3,600 neighbourhood policing teams across the country , most – if not all – of them will have antisocial behaviour as a top or high priority . "
The vulnerability of many of the victims of antisocial behaviour was underlined in the HMIC research , which found that one in five repeat victims classed themselves as disabled in some way .
COLUMBUS , Ohio -
The Ohio House Insurance Committee chairman has begun investigating the firings of a trio of state employees who say they were fired for objecting to their boss 's attempts to force her Christian beliefs on them .
In a Thursday letter , Rep. Dan Dodd , a Hebron Democrat , wrote that the Feb. 16 firings by Virginia McInerney , director of the little - known Workers ' Compensation Council , were " very troubling . "
" I have started gathering information on this matter and plan to utilize all available options to investigate this matter fully , " Dodd wrote to Sen .
Steven Buehrer , a Delta Republican who chairs the legislative board that oversees the council .
Dodd , who also serves on the board , also urged the GOP chairman to formally convene the council to look into the firings .
Dodd 's investigation will focus on allegations from the employees -- executive assistant Stephanie Irwin and staff attorneys Kim Finley and Shadya Yazback -- that McInerney fired them after they objected to her repeated attempts to bring religion into the state office .
The three were McInerney 's entire staff .
The women complained that McInerney declared to the staff that she was sent by God to her job , inquired about their religious beliefs , called them in to pray aloud , cited scripture in her reprimands and said Satan was to blame for obstacles the staff encountered in their jobs .
They accused her of wrongful discharge , religious discrimination and harassment , retaliation and age discrimination .
McInerney , 52 , on Thursday disputed the employees ' claims .
" I certainly deny the wrongdoing they are alleging , " she said .
However , she declined to discuss the circumstances that led to the firings because the trio may bring a future lawsuit .
" It 's not advisable for me to go into details about the personnel matters that led up to it , " she said .
McInerney did say the women told her on Feb. 10 that they could n't work for her anymore , but asked for terms in a separation agreement that she could n't grant under state law .
Those included eight weeks severance pay and a confidentiality pact that McInerney said would have violated Ohio 's open records law .
McInerney said her counter offer was rejected by the women , leaving her no choice but to fire them on Feb. 16 .
Finley on Thursday would n't discuss the terms sought by the staffers but said McInerney was n't interested in trying to reach a settlement .
" Instead of trying to negotiate in good faith , she fired us , " she said .
Dodd 's letter also questions whether McInerney had any " undue influence " on the legislative analyses produced by her staff , noting that one staff member attributed her firing to her inability to recognize McInerney 's " divine gift for editing . "
McInerney denied ever " authorizing or looking for anyone to modify a document based on partisan lines . "

A major wildlife survey has today confirmed the worst fears of birdwatchers : the coldest winter for 30 years was disastrous for small birds .
Sightings of small species such as the goldcrest , coal tit and long - tailed tit were dramatically down compared to after the previous year 's mild winter , the RSPB 's Big Garden Birdwatch found .
The survey , which was conducted by over half a million people in January and is the world 's largest public participation wildlife event , also showed a significant rise in hungry countryside birds such fieldfare and redwings visiting gardens in search of food .
Sarah Kelly , the survey 's co-ordinator , said : " We were particularly concerned for small birds over the winter , asking people to make sure they kept feeders topped up and supplied with fresh water to help them .
Smaller birds have to eat for more of their waking time as the temperature drops , and during hard frosts and snow cover often have to feed 100 % of the time from dawn until dusk .
Many smaller birds will be in trouble if they fail to find food even for a day . "
The survey saw 530,000 people take part and their records showed the average number of birds per garden for already rare goldcrests were down 75 % on January 2009 , being seen in only about 5,300 gardens .
Long - tailed tits were down 27 % to an average of one bird per garden , and coal tits down 20 % .
The long - tailed tithad been thriving due to a succession of mild winters and was one of last year 's big success stories .
This winter 's bitter weather had a greater impact because the cold spell was national Kelly explained .
Most previous drops in small bird populations caused by cold weather - such as the death of all the Cetti's warblers in Kent after two successive cold winters in the mid-1980s - were only regional .
The snowy winter also led to a huge rise in sightings of countryside birds such as thrushes and finches in the UK 's gardens .
The number of fieldfares was up 73 % on last year , redwings up 185 % and song thrushes up 51 % , though their numbers are still relatively low compared to garden stalwarts such as blue tits and chaffinches .
Kelly said snow on the ground and frozen berries had led the rural birds to look further afield for food , venturing into gardens .
Modern farming methods , where fields are no longer left to seed during winter , have also been cited as a cause by the British Trust for Ornithology .
Another species apparently doing well was the blackcap , which was up 47 % against 2009 levels .
The RSPB believes many may have been migrants sheltering from even harsher weather in mainland Europe , though it also speculates that the increased sightings may simply be a result of the blackcaps getting used to eating from bird feeders and becoming more visible .
However , the long - term picture painted by the survey is still one of a general decline in garden sightings of birds since its inception in 1979 .
House sparrows ( the most - spotted bird ) and starlings ( down from number two to three for the first time in over 10 years ) have seen numbers drop respectively 62 % and 79 % since the survey began .
Aside from blackbirds moving up the list from third to second , the top ten list is otherwise similar to previous years , featuring wood pigeons , robins and great tits .
Garden birds were also assisted by an enthusiastic public response to conservationist 's calls to put out feed .
Two in three people in the UK feed garden birds and the rush to help birds through the cold spell also helped businesses such as the Garden Centre Group , which saw sales of wild bird feed rise 8 % in the five weeks to the end of 2009 .
The freezing weather has delayed breeding too , said Tim Harrison , development officer for the year - round garden birdwatch run by BTO : " On Valentine 's Day 2010 there were nine species recorded as having active nests - ie eggs and / or young - compared with 16 - 17 species in milder winters . "
The RSPB survey involved participants counting birds in their garden over one hour on the weekend of 30 - 31 January .
Guardian readers submitted hundreds of photos of their sightings to a dedicated Flickr group and took part in a ' live ' birdwatch on theguardian.com .
Ups and downs , compared to the 2009 survey
Blackbirds - up 16 % , 3.28 birds per garden in 2010 , up from 2.84 in 2009
Reed buntings - up 140 % , 0.03 birds per garden
Song thrushes - up 51 % , 0.37 birds per garden
Bullfinches - up 54 % , 0.18 birds per garden
Robins - up 10 % , 1.49 birds per garden
Goldcrests - down 75 % , 0.01 birds per garden
Long - tailed tits - down 27 % , 0.97 birds per garden
Coal tits - down 20 % , 0.60 birds per garden
Siskins - down 31 % , 0.09 birds per garden
Greenfinches - down 18 % , 0.88 birds per garden
Tips to help birds survive the cold
• Put out a variety of feed - seeds , fatballs and peanuts
• Break ice , and leave out fresh water daily .
Never put add anything , especially salt , as it can kill birds .
• Clear snow from lawns to help ground - feeding species such as blackbirds
• Create homes for birds with nestboxes , and preserve old trees that have holes

After years of defeats , fragmentation and doubt even by its own clerics about its prospects in this election , the movement has embraced the political process , while remaining steadfast in opposition to any ties with the United States .
It was never going to be easy to form a new postelection government — and the Sadrists ’ unpredictability , along with a new confidence , may now make it that much harder .
“ As our representation in Parliament increases , so will our power , ” said Asma al - Musawi , a Sadrist lawmaker .
“ We will soon play the role that we have been given . ”
A worshiper at a Friday Prayer service put it more bluntly .
“ Today is our day ! ” he shouted to hundreds of supporters gathered outside the movement ’s office in a ramshackle neighborhood that bears its name , Sadr City , where electric wires are tangled like cobwebs and discontent surges forth from a furnace of poverty , anger and frustration .
The results of the election are not yet conclusive , and under a complicated formula to allot seats , the percentage of the vote will not necessarily reflect actual numbers in the 325 - member Parliament .

But opponents and allies alike believe the Sadrists may win more than 40 seats .
In all likelihood , that would make them the clear majority in the Iraqi National Alliance , a predominantly Shiite coalition and the leading rival of Mr. Maliki .
If the numbers are borne out , the Sadrists could wield a bloc roughly the same size as the Kurds , who have served as kingmakers in governing coalitions since 2005 .

Stonehenge may have been surrounded by a " Stonehedge " that blocked onlookers from seeing secret rituals , according to a new study .
Evidence for two encircling hedges — possibly thorn bushes — planted some 3,600 years ago was uncovered during a survey of the site by English Heritage , the government agency responsible for maintaining the monument in southern England .
The idea that Stonehedge was a shield against prying eyes is n’t yet firmly rooted , but it 's archaeologists ' leading theory .
For instance the newfound banks are too low and unsubstantial to have had a defensive role .
" The best [ theory ] we can come up with is some sort of hedge bank , " said English Heritage archaeologist David Field , whose team discovered the two landscape features in April 2009 .
" We think they served as some sort of screen to filter access to the center [ of Stonehenge ] . "
( See Stonehenge pictures . )
The shallow earthworks — each runs inside a ring of known Bronze Age pits — are just visible to an expert eye , " but you need to get down on your hands and knees " to see them , Field added .
The archaeologists did n't find any physical evidence of vegetation , but the shallow features resemble former hedge banks that are seen around formerly hedged fields .
Early Gardeners ?
While there ’s no firm evidence for a British prehistoric landscape - gardening tradition , there 's evidence for tree cultivation at the time Stonehenge was in use .
" It seems standard - size trees were being cultivated and looked after in order to provide straight , telegraph - pole - like features for the construction of palisades [ fences of defensive stakes ] and so on , " Field said .
With that in mind , Stonehedge 's " vegetation screens are quite feasible , " Field said .
" Something like thorn bushes … or small trees . "
Past archaeological investigations at Stonehenge have tended to focus chiefly on the stones themselves , he noted .
" To date nobody has really considered the vegetation around the stones . "
The latest finds , reported in the March / April edition of British Archaeology magazine , come " completely out of the blue , " according to editor Mike Pitts , an archaeologist and Stonehenge expert .
The magazine , a publication of the Council for British Archaeology , often publishes archaeologist - written reports on new finds .
While Pitts thinks the hedge theory is " a perfectly reasonable explanation … there have been no excavations of these features , so until that happens we wo n’t really know what ’s going on . "
Mystery Mound
The April 2009 landscape survey employed advanced equipment , such as high - resolution surface lasers , to discern shapes invisible to the human eye .
" Believe it or not , it 's the first earthworks survey of the monument since 1919 , " Pitts added .
" Unsurprisingly , all sorts of things were found . "
Those include a flattened mound near the center of Stonehenge , which may be a burial .
The Stonehenge area is littered with prehistoric burial mounds , and the monument itself likely served first and foremost as a cemetery , experts say .
Partially concealed by fallen stones , the forgotten mound had been previously recorded in 18th - and 19th - century watercolor paintings .
" There ’s a good chance it 's prehistoric , " said English Heritage 's Field .
The suspected burial mound possibly dates to the earliest phases of the monument , as early as 5,000 years ago , Field said .

I 've watched a lot of porn and I have to say this is one of the hottest amateur videos I 've ever seen .
Video quality is lacking , but these two make up for it in dialogue and pretty good camera work for one cam either handheld or on a tripod .
They do use a remote camera control to pan in and out ( no pun intended ) and they do an excellent job of keeping the action in mid screen .
I think there 's a fairly good chance they are brother and sister .
They do look alike and are definitely in tune with each other .
I just love the way he throbs his cock to get it into his sister 's pussy several times when she 's riding him on top .
I also love the way she asks him to cum in her pussy and yes , he gives her a wonderful cream pie at the end .
In all well worth the time to watch the whole video .
Excepting video quality I give it a 10 out of 10 .
Please guys , if you read this , do it again in HD ...
Nissan Leaf electric car to be built in Sunderland
Nissan 's Leaf is expected to guarantee employment for hundreds Nissan is to build its new electric car - the Leaf - at its Sunderland plant , the Japanese company has announced .
Hundreds of jobs are expected to be safeguarded once production begins in 2013 - part of a £ 420 m investment in electric cars .
The investment is backed by a £ 20.7 m government grant and up to £ 220 m from the European Investment Bank .
Ministers have also backed Ford 's planned £ 1.5 bn investment in cleaner engines with £ 360 m in loan guarantees .
' Vote of confidence ' About 50,000 Nissan Leaf hatchbacks , which run entirely on lithium - ion batteries , will roll off the Sunderland production line a year .
Lord Mandelson said the development was a " fantastic vote of confidence " in the plant and its " excellent workforce " .
ANALYSIS
By Jorn Madslien , business reporter , BBC News Nissan had already said that it would invest some 200 m euros in a battery factory near its Sunderland manufacturing plant , yet it was never a given that the company would produce its Leaf electric car here too .
Its investment in the region is now set to double .
The North East 's efforts to gear up its electric motoring infrastructure and the UK government 's recent decision to subsidise buyers of electric cars to the tune of £ 5,000 obviously helped the Japanese automotive giant make up its mind .
But in the end , the right to produce the car and thus secure thousands of jobs in an otherwise economically depressed region was earned by the Nissan factory 's management and workers .
Why Sunderland got the Leaf The North East eyes low carbon future Trevor Mann at Nissan said the government had played " quite a significant role " in the carmaker 's decision to build the Leaf in Sunderland .
" Not just in monetary terms , but also setting its stall out in terms of the infrastructure [ needed to power electric cars ] . "
Sunderland had already been named as the site to produce Nissan 's electric car batteries , creating 350 new jobs .
About 60,000 batteries will be made there when production begins next month .
Lord Mandelson said : " By working together we can achieve our aim of making the UK a world - leader in ultra - low carbon vehicles . "
Nissan said the Leaf hatchback would be the world 's first affordable , mass - produced , zero-emission car .
Nissan senior vice president Andy Palmer said the car would go on sale later this year and the UK was the third country to produce the car after Japan and the United States .
Nissan 's Sunderland plant is the UK's largest car factory , employing 4,000 people and producing about a third of the cars made in the UK .
It was founded in 1984 and built its five millionth vehicle in June 2008 .
The car battery programme has already seen Nissan invest £ 179 m there .
Last year , Nissan 's chief executive Carlos Ghosn underlined his company 's commitment to its electric cars programme .
" The electric car will account for 10 % of the global market in 10 years , " he told BBC News .
The firm has not yet revealed how much the Leaf will cost .
' Major investor '
Ford 's plans involve an investment of more than £ 1.5 bn in six projects across four sites .
They will safeguard about 2,800 skilled jobs at its research centre in Dunton , Essex , and its factories in Dagenham , Essex , Southampton and Bridgend in South Wales .
About a quarter of all Ford engines worldwide and over half of its diesel engines are produced in the UK .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said : " Ford is a major investor in research and development in the UK .
The government stands ready and willing to support these innovative R&D projects backed by a highly skilled workforce . "

Just over a year ago , and spurred by an article in Time , I wrote a post on the possible global supply of lithium , which is used in renewable batteries , and a major choice for use in the batteries of electric vehicles , such as the Chevy Volt .
Since the story has acquired more recent interest this week , and with new information , it is worth re-visiting the topic .
I began the original post by noting that our first introduction to these batteries was in our role as an Explosives Lab when we found out - in a series of experiments a long time ago - that they can blow up if handled wrongly .
And it turns out that such a risk is still around , though not that common .
But to put the event in context :
Fifteen incidents in the last two decades were serious enough to warrant a decision to re-route a plane or perform an emergency landing , according to FAA data .
For instance , in 2008 , there were nine battery accidents resulting in two minor injuries .
To put that figure in perspective , that year 3.3 billion lithium batteries were transported on 77 million flights , including 56 million passenger and combination passenger / cargo flights .
Based on that data , one 's chances of being on the same flight with someone who suffers a minor injury because of a malfunctioning battery was about 1 in 28 million in 2008 .
In comparison , the one - year odds of dying from a car accident in the U.S. are 1 in 6,584 , according to the National Safety Council .
Since we also look at processing , I became curious about where and how the lithium is mined .
Recently , however , h/t to JoulesBurn , there was an article by Jack Lifton explaining some additional production issues .
So what I thought I ’d do is to integrate some of this additional information into a more up - to - date post .
It turns out that most lithium comes from salt lake deposits such as those in Chile and Bolivia .
The biggest deposit in the world lies in the Salar de Uyini , Bolivia , which is also the world ’s largest salt flat .
A quick look through Google Earth gives the location , with the white in the picture being the salt flat , and not snow .
La Paz , the capital of Bolivia is at the top .
The world ’s largest lithium deposit is at Salar di Uyuni ( Google Earth )
The lithium is found in the crystallized salt , and in the brine that underlies the crust .
As the world gears up to demand more , Bolivia is determined to keep as much of the “ value added ” part of the processing to itself .
Thus the intent has been that the state would initially act alone in industrializing their deposits , and not look for foreign partners until 2013 .
Unfortunately its attitude has not drawn a lot of excitement from the world press , since there appears to be more than enough for current demands available from elsewhere .
Chile provides 61 % of lithium exports to the US , with Argentina providing 36 % , says the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) , with Chile having estimated reserves of 3 m tonnes , and Argentina about 400,000 tonnes .
. . . . .
Lithium production via the brine method is much less expensive than mining , says John McNulty , analyst at global bank Credit Suisse .
Lithium from minerals or ores costs about $ 4,200 - 4,500 / tonne ( €2,800 - 3,000 / tonne ) to produce , while brine - based lithium costs around $ 1,500 - 2,300 / tonne to produce .
Melting snow from the Andes Mountains runs about 130 feet ( 39.6 meters ) underground , into lithium deposits , then gathering into pools of salt water , or brine .
The brine is pumped out from under salt flats such as Chile 's Salar de Atacama , and spread among networks of ponds where the desert sun and high altitude provide a beneficial environment for evaporation .
It takes about a year for the brine to reach a lithium concentration of 6 % , when it is shipped to a plant to be purified , dried and crystallized into lithium carbonate , which then is granulated into a fine powder for battery makers .
Lithium stores a very large amount of energy for its volume , which makes it perfect for electronics .
Unfortunately for those who are expecting electric cars to spring out of the woodwork in the next few years ( remembering that the President ’s plan calls for 1 million plug - in hybrids by 2015 ) Mitsubishi estimates that the world will need 500,000 tons per year at full ramp up .
The Salar di Uyuni deposit in Bolivia holds at least 9 million tons , although the country has , in total , perhaps as much as 73 million tons .
The only progress to date is a pilot plant that was intended to produce some 40 tons by the end of last year , as it geared up to full production , with the product coming from brine processing .
The world supply of lithium itself is considered to be 28.4 million tons , equivalent to 150 million tons of lithium carbonate .
The USGS has estimated that the deposit can produce about 5.4 million tons of lithium , relative to a total US reserve base of 410,000 tons .
With the slump in the world economy last year demand dropped , and so lithium producer SQM SA has recently dropped the price 20 % since there is more than enough to go around .
Source USGS
Of course that all depends on how Chinese demand changes in the next short while .
Source Research in China
In terms of how much lithium goes into a battery , it is about 20 lb for an EV , and about 0.1 oz for your cell phone .
However there are other industrial uses for lithium , so that at present only about 25 % of world production ends up in a battery .
Part of the problem with the Bolivian deposit , as Jack Lifton noted is that the deposit is contaminated with magnesium , which is also true at the Atacama deposit in Chile , except that while the Mg / Li ratio there is 6.4 to 1 , the deposit is 0.15 % Lithium .
At Hombre Muerto the Argentinean deposit , the Mg / Li ratio is down to 1.37 to 1 , making it easier to produce , even though the grade is lower , at only 0.062 % Li. Unfortunately the Bolivian deposit has only a 0.028 % lithium , while an Mg / Li ratio of 19.9:1 so that it has both a poorer grade , and a higher Mg content .
To add to these disadvantages , being high in the Andes means that evaporation is not as fast , and so processing costs go even further .
This is especially true since the lake apparently floods every year , slowing evaporation even further .
So put it all together , and , for the moment , the production of much lithium from Bolivia might be a bit further in the future than they currently expect .
Which is perhaps why the plant gets being pushed further and further into the future .
By November last it had been put back to 2014 .
( And the claim that the technology will all be homegrown is a little more suspect . )
. . . companies like Japan 's Sumitomo and Mitsubishi , and South Korea 's state - run Kores -- Korea Resources Corporation , are helping the government find the best way to extract lithium from Uyuni " free of charge , " but will be the preferential buyers of Bolivia 's lithium carbonate .
Lithium is also produced from coarse grained igneous rocks called pegmatites , with spodumene being the most common .
American mines were in the Carolinas , but closed since brine processing is cheaper than the mining and processing of the hard rock .
Geothermal power plants draw hot brine from underground as a power source , and these brines can contain dissolved minerals .
Thus , for example the seven Geothermal plants at the Salton Sea are reported to be able to produce up to 16,000 tons of lithium per year .
The facilities are better known as a source of zinc ( pdf ) .
However the potential as a source of lithium is becoming increasingly recognized .
Theme parks are being flooded with applications from job seekers , as unemployed mortgage agents , sales clerks and construction workers who ca n’t find work elsewhere seek temporary positions that often pay little more than minimum wage .
A job fair at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia last weekend drew 1,600 people -- in the rain .
Universal Studios Hollywood took in more than 1,100 job applications on just one day last month .
Disneyland in Anaheim and Knott ’s Berry Farm in Buena Park have received so many job applications that they put off plans to hold jobs fairs this year .
In the past , summer jobs at theme parks were often the path for teenagers and college students to get their first paycheck , doing such tasks as playing Goofy , Snow White and other costumed characters at Disneyland or running roller coasters at Magic Mountain .
But with the unemployment rate in California at 12.4 % , the parks are now getting applications from people with years of work experience .
Dominick Muniz , 27 , used to drive a forklift and work in construction .
But this week , he showed up at Knott ’s Berry Farm ’s employment center in hopes of landing a temporary job that pays $ 320 to $ 380 a week .
And he ’s not picky about what kind of job .
“ I ’ve got a family to feed , ” the Whittier man said as he filled out the forms .
“ I just want to get whatever comes along . ”
The new wave of theme park job seekers increasingly includes white - collar workers , such as office managers , loan processors , sales associates and restaurant managers , according to hiring supervisors at several parks .
Being overqualified does n’t rule people out for getting hired , they said .
“ We are getting a lot of people who , in a normal economy , would be considered overqualified , ” said Joe Selph , manager of staffing and training at Universal Studios Hollywood .
Not just for teens
The trend is playing out across the country .
“ Last year , we started to see the numbers pick up , and they included people who are not the traditional theme park workers , ” said Colleen Mangone , a spokeswoman for the International Assn. of Amusement Parks and Attractions .
“ We are seeing more seniors , teachers and people with more experience . ”
Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky , Ohio , one of the nation ’s most popular theme parks , drew nearly 30,000 applications last year to fill up to 4,500 positions and is on pace to receive just as many this year , said park spokesman Robin Innes .
“ Traditionally , we get high school and college students , ” Innes said .
“ Now a lot more are experienced workers and some senior citizens . ”
In Southern California , which has been a trend setter for the modern theme park since Disneyland opened in 1955 , the jobs are abundant and provide another avenue for the unemployed to find work .
Employment at the region ’s 35 theme parks and arcades , large and small , peaks at nearly 24,000 workers annually , according to the Southern California Assn. of Governments .
“ It helps the economy to have those jobs and to have the parks open year - round too , ” said Jim Futrell , a historian with the National Amusement Park Historical Assn .
But the vast majority of theme park jobs are temporary , filled during the peak tourist seasons : spring break , the whole summer and Halloween .
Most of those jobs pay only slightly more than minimum wage , making them ideal for teenagers and college students .
Bran Danke , 31 , a former pizza restaurant manager who has been out of work about a month , said the job market in Los Angeles is so weak that he had no choice but to apply for a temporary position at Universal Studios Hollywood .
The park hopes to hire about 200 people this spring for such positions as cooks , food stand attendants and ticket sellers .
“ I just need a job to get by until I can get a steady job , ” he said after an hourlong interview session at the park .
Claire Colby , 50 , a former floral designer who has been out of work since June , said she applied for a temporary position at Knott ’s Berry Farm because she could n’t find work in her field .
“ I ’m looking for something to get me in the door , ” she said .
“ I have skills they could really use here . ”
Job fairs canceled
Both Knott ’s Berry Farm and Disneyland typically hold job fairs in the spring and early summer to hire workers for peak tourist seasons .
But both parks are forgoing plans for fairs this year because the flow of applicants is so strong .
Knott ’s Berry Farm said it is getting up to 300 job applications a week , easily enough to fill about 800 seasonal positions needed for the summer .
In addition , the turnover rate at the park has recently dropped significantly , a sign that employees are staying longer because they know it would be difficult to find a new job .
“ That ’s unfortunate for the outside world , but for us in the park that ’s good , ” said Jaime Coria , the park ’s employment manager .
On the first day that Universal Studios Hollywood began to accept applications to fill 200 positions for spring break , the park received 1,100 applications .
That ’s about twice the number that came in two years ago , according to park officials .
At Magic Mountain , the stream of job applications has increased as the recession has deepened .
Last year , the park ’s job fair attracted 1,100 job seekers , twice as many as in 2008 , park spokeswoman Sue Carpenter said .
At Saturday ’s rainy job fair , 1,642 people stood in line for up to 3,500 summer jobs .
The park will continue to accept applications until all the positions are filled .
“ You definitely can see the numbers peak when the economy went south , ” Carpenter said .
Unique perks
Despite the low pay , theme park jobs often offer unique benefits , such as free admission and discounted tickets for family and friends , said Robert Niles , editor of Theme Park Insider , a website that keeps track of trends and news at theme parks .
“ It looks like theme parks will again this year have their pick of applicants , rather than having to go begging to fill jobs , like many did a few years ago , ” he said .
Knott ’s Berry Farm seemed to have liked what it saw in Muniz , the unemployed forklift operator .
A few minutes after he submitted his application , he sauntered out of the employment center grinning widely .
“ I got an interview , ” he said .
“ They want me to come back for an interview . ”

I usually do n’t like making grandiose statements ahead of myself , like “ Astrology is totally unscientific ” , because I prefer leaving the benefit of the doubt until I check the claim .
In the case of Astrology , however , there ’s no use pretending .
Astrology is n’t science .
It makes baseless predictions , relies on overly - generalized statements and has a false basic premise * .
You can read this online from various other sources , and there is n’t much use for me to reiterate the points made .
What I am going to do is test the basic premise .
* Phil Plait , “ The Bad Astronomer ” , has a great analysis of Astrology that goes over all the above , and more , as does the skeptic dictionary and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific among many , many others .
You can also watch Australian Skeptics ’ Richard Saunders brief live argument with an Astrologer .
Note :
For your convenience ( and due to popular demand ) , I added an automatic tool where you can measure the force applied by any object at any distance .
Test it yourself !

( opens as a new window ) .
The basic premise of astrology
Astrologers claim that the positions of the planets and “ Zodiac ” signs ( constellations of stars ) at the moment of our birth – and generally throughout our lives – affect our personality , mood and affairs .
I will not get into the so - called “ metaphysical ” effects , a mishmash of misunderstood physical theories ( quantum physics , dark matter , dark energy , etc ) with some pseudoscientific new - age unfalsifiable claims ( from “ fate ” and “ luck ” to “ planetary energies ” , whatever that means ) .
What I will do is treat the claim that astrology has merit in science .
Many astrology - believers think that since the planets exert gravity , they might affect our brains , and therefore our moods .
Many people give the moon as an example .
The moon ’s gravity is known to affect tides – a powerful force we can witness .
Many take this as proof that the planets ’ gravity is affecting our bodies .
On its face , the claim makes sense .
We are going to examine it .
Gravity , the force of masses
Any two objects with mass exert gravitational force on one another .
That force is related to the masses of the objects and the distance between them by the formula :
\( F= G \ frac{M , m}{r ^2}\ ) \( left ( G=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{ - 11} \ frac{\mbox{m}^3}{\mbox{kg} \ cdot \ mbox{s} ^2} right ) \)
Where G is the universal constant of gravitation , M and m are the masses of the objects and r is the distance between them .
Since we think of planets as incredibly big objects , the idea that their gravity affects our bodies sounds reasonable .
But to a newborn , there are other “ massive ” objects around that exert the same type of force as the planets .
They might be much smaller than the planets , but they are much closer , too .
If the position of planets at the moment of our birth defines our personality , so should the positions of objects in the delivery room .
This is a testable claim .
The test : planets vs. delivery room
We are going to compare two forces , those coming from the planets and those coming from objects in the delivery room , to reach a conclusion :
If the forces from the objects in the delivery room outweigh those from the planets , then astrologers should , at the very least , ask the weights and positions of the people in the delivery room when they calculate your chart .
If , however , the forces of the planets are substantial , then astrology might have some scientific merit .
This is what we are about to check .
OMG !
Math !
Panic !
Relax .
We are about to calculate physical forces so there is some math involved , but you can choose if you want to see it or not .
Yes , I ’m that considerate .
If you want to go over my math so you can repeat it yourself , add to it ( items I missed ? ) or criticize me ( peer - review away , mathematicians ) you can reveal the calculations by clicking the “ Show the Math ” links .
Otherwise , just continue reading the solutions only .
Those are useful too .
kthxbai !
One more note : Forces are directional ( vectors ) , but in this case , since we want to calculate the maximum possible force , we will treat them as if they are “ lined up ” , and therefore calculate them numerically .
What about the mother ?
Right , the mother is also in the room , and her body also exerts a gravitational force on the baby .
However ,
The baby is inside the mother , and in her midsection .
He is , almost literally * , in her center of mass .
For all intents and purposes the mother ’s gravity “ cancels out ” from all directions and there ’s no use adding her into the calculation .
* Physicists , stay calm , think “ spherical chicken in a vacuum ” and bear with me here .
On we go .
The delivery room
Since my intent is to calculate the most basic hospital delivery room , I put in the most basic items that should be found in one .
There are likely many more people and pieces of equipment in and outside the room , but the goal of these calculations is a “ conservative estimation . ”
Therefore , I will ignore the size of the hospital , other people walking by and other large machines that exist in the building .
See “ Conclusion ” for more about those .
Here ’s a list of what should be the most basic elements in a delivery room :
People :
A doctor ( obviously )
A nurse
OB tech ( whose job is to help the doctor and nurse during the actual birth )
The partner ( assuming the mother has one )
Objects
The Calculation
In the following section I will calculate the force exerted on the baby from each of these elements by estimating their weight and mass and their relative distance .
I will assume average - sized staff ( 75 - 85 kg ) , leaning towards the thinner side , to keep my estimate conservative .
I will also assume that the baby is level with their midsections ( i.e. , their centers of mass ) which will allow me to ignore their height in my calculation .
Show the Math
The Doctor
The doctor stands directly in front and above the baby before it is born .
If anything affects the baby , he is it .
Mass = 82 kg
Distance from baby = 0.3 m ( 30 cm ) \( F_{doctor}=G\frac {82 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{( 0.3 m) ^2}=( 6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kgcdot s^2} ) \ frac{295.2 kg^2}{0.09 m^2}=2.19 \cdot 10 ^{ - 7} \ frac{m\cdot kg}{s ^2}\ ) \( F_{doctor}=G\frac {82 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{( 0.3 m) ^2}=( 6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kgcdot s^2} ) \ frac{295.2 kg^2}{0.09 m^2}=2.19\cdot 10 ^{ - 7} \ frac{m\cdot kg}{s ^2}\)
The force exerted by the doctor ’s gravity = \( 2.19 \cdot 10 ^ { - 7} N\ ) The Nurse Mass = 75 kg
Distance from baby = 1 m \( F_{nurse}=G\frac{75 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{ ( 1 m) ^2}=( 6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg\cdot s^2} ) \ frac{270 kg^2}{1 m^2}=1.8\cdot 10 ^{ - 8} \ frac{m\cdot kg}{s ^2}\ ) \( F_{nurse}=G\frac{75 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{ ( 1 m) ^2}=( 6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg\cdot s^2} ) \ frac{270 kg^2}{1 m^2}=1.8\cdot 10 ^{ - 8} \ frac{m\cdot kg}{s ^2}\)
The force exerted by the nurse ’s gravity = \( 1.8 \cdot 10 ^ { - 8} N\ ) The OB Tech
This person will be standing next to the instruments , monitoring the delivery .
He will likely be a bit further away than the doctor and nurse .
Mass = 80 kg
Distance from baby = 3 m \( F_{OB Tech}=G\frac{80 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{ ( 3 m) ^2}=( 6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg\cdot s^2} ) \ frac{288 kg ^2}{9 m^2}= 2.13 \cdot 10^{-9}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\ ) \( F_{OB Tech}=G\frac{80 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{ ( 3 m) ^2}=( 6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg\cdot s^2} ) \ frac{288 kg ^2}{9 m^2}= 2.13 \cdot 10^{-9}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\)
The force exerted by the OB Tech ’s gravity = \( 2.13 \cdot 10 ^ { - 9} N\ ) The Partner Mass = 80 kg
Distance from baby = 0.5 m \( F_{Partner}=G\frac{80 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{( 0.5 m) ^2}=( 6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg\cdot s^2} ) \ frac{288 kg^2}{0.25 m^2}= 7.68 \cdot 10^{-8}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\ ) \( F_{Partner}=G\frac{80 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{( 0.5 m) ^2}=( 6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg\cdot s^2} ) \ frac{288 kg^2}{0.25 m^2}= 7.68 \cdot 10^{-8}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\)
The force exerted by the partner ’s gravity = \( 7.68 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8} N\ ) Bed or Birthing Chair Estimated mass : 276 lbs = 125.19 kg
Estimated distance : 0.05 m ( 5 cm ) ( Source : http://www.spinlife.com/Drive-Medical-600-lbs.-Bariatric-Full-Electric-Frame/spec.cfm?productID=82578 this is n’t a birthing bed , but it ’s close enough for an estimate ) \( F=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \cdot 125.19 kg}{( 0.05 m) ^2}= 1.2\cdot 10^{-5}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\ ) \( F=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \cdot 125.19 kg}{( 0.05 m) ^2}= 1.2\cdot 10^{-5}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\)
The force exerted by the bed ’s gravity = \( 1.2 \cdot 10 ^ { - 5} N\ ) Heart Monitor Estimated mass : 25 kg
Estimated distance : 1 m \( F=6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \ cdot 25 kg}{ ( 1 m) ^2}= 6 \cdot 10 ^{ - 9} \ frac{m\cdot kg}{s ^2}\ ) \( F=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \ cdot 25 kg}{ ( 1 m) ^2}= 6 \cdot 10 ^{ - 9} \ frac{m\cdot kg}{s ^2}\)
The force exerted by heart monitor ’s gravity = \ ( 6 \cdot 10 ^ { - 9} N\ ) Scale ( to weigh the baby ) Estimated mass : 3.6 kg
Estimated distance : 3 m ( source : http://www.egeneralmedical.com/detecto-digital-baby-scale-scale-71170.html
this is a small version , good enough for our calculation , but it ’s worth noting most hospitals will carry a much larger one , on wheels , obviously weighing much more ) .
\( F=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{ ( 3 m) ^2}= 9.6\cdot 10 ^{ - 11} \ frac{m\cdot kg}{s ^2}\ ) \( F=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \cdot 3.6 kg}{ ( 3 m) ^2}= 9.6\cdot 10 ^{ - 11} \ frac{m\cdot kg}{s ^2}\)
The force exerted by the scale ’s gravity = \( 9.6 \cdot 10 ^{ - 11} N\ )
Blood pressure monitor , Stethoscopes and other random small items
There are a LOT of items in a delivery room , and I am very likely to forget a whole bunch of them .
We will estimate , though , a total of 5 kg of extra random items like more chairs , the blankets and sheet , stethoscopes , blood pressure monitors , picture frames , and anything else that might exist in a room and did n’t add into the calculation .
This is a very very conservative calculation .
I will take the average distance of all of those random items as 4 meters .
Mass = 5 kg
Average distance from the baby = 4 m \( F=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \cdot 5 kg}{ ( 4 m) ^2}=7.5\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\ ) \( F=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \cdot 5 kg}{ ( 4 m) ^2}=7.5\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\)
The force exerted by the random items ’ gravity = \( 7.5 \cdot 10 ^{ - 11} N\ )
Total Maximum Force
So , to summarize ( and , for those of you who cared not for the mathematics , to state in the first place ) :
The Doctor = \( 2.19 \cdot 10 ^{ - 7} N\ )
The Nurse = \( 1.8 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8} N\ )
The OB Tech = \( 2.13 \cdot 10 ^{ - 9} N\ )
The Partner = \( 7.68 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8} N\ )
The Bed = \( 1.2\cdot 10 ^{ - 5} N\ )
Heart Monitor = \ ( 6\cdot 10 ^{ - 9} N\ )
Scale = \( 9.6\cdot 10 ^{ - 11} N\ )
Other Small Objects = \( 7.5 \cdot 10 ^{ - 11} N\ )
Show the Math
From people : \( 2.19 \cdot 10 ^{ - 7}N + 1.8 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8} + 2.13 cdot 10 ^{-9}+7.68 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8} N = 3.1593 \cdot 10 ^{ - 7} \ )
From objects : \( 1.2 \cdot 10 ^{ - 5}N + 6 \cdot 10 ^{- 9}N + 9.6 \cdot 10 ^{ - 11}N + 7.5 \cdot 10 ^{-11}N=1.2006171\cdot 10 ^{ - 5} \ )
Total Force : \( 1.232cdot 10 ^{ - 5} N\ )
The Planets
EDIT : I have recalculated the forces from the planets .
It seems that during the initial calculations I made a rather small ( but recurring ) conversion error , and due to vigilant commentors , it was properly corrected .
You should note , though , that the total force after this re-examination did n’t change .
My calculation was fine , I just had a problem with how I wrote it out in the process ( in the math part ) .
Apologies .
Now , astrology claims that the planets exert a force on the baby , and their different locations change that force ever - so - slightly to somehow affect the baby ’s personality traits .
The idea that the planets exert a force , even on the baby , is true .
Whether or not it is canceled out or overwhelmed by other forces is a different issue .
Our next step , then , is to calculate the maximum force that can be exerted from the various planets , and combine them to get the maximum possible force exerted by the planets .

Minimum Distance from Earth : 4,200,000,000 km ( \( 4.2 \cdot 10 ^ { 12} m\ ) ) \( F=6.67\cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \cdot 0.0125 \cdot 10 ^{24} kg}{( 4.2\cdot 10 ^ {12} m) ^2}=1.7\cdot 10 ^{-13}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\ ) \( F=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \cdot 0.0125 \cdot 10 ^{24} kg}{( 4.2\cdot 10 ^ {12} m) ^2}=1.7\cdot 10 ^{-13}\frac{m\cdot kg}{s^2}\ ) Maximum Force by Pluto = \( 1.27 \cdot 10 ^{ - 13} N\ )
The force from all the planets combined
All of the forces above were calculated as if the planet is in its closest position to the Earth .
The chances that all planets together will be in such positions are incredibly small .
This does n’t usually happen , and the resultant combined force is much smaller .
However , we can still calculate the maximum theoretical force that can be produced by all planets combined on the newborn baby .
Here they are :
Mercury = \( 1.21 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8} N\ )
Venus = \( 8.06 \cdot 10 ^{ - 7} N\ )
Mars = \( 5.17 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8} N\ )
Jupiter = \( 5.72 \cdot 10 ^{ - 7} N\ )
Saturn = \( 9.55 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8} N\ )
Uranus = \( 3.13 \cdot 10 ^{ - 9} N\ )
Neptune = \( 1.27 \cdot 10 ^{ - 9} N\ )
Pluto = \( 1.27 \cdot 10 ^{ - 13} N\ )
( Before you protest about Pluto , read this : there are many problems with including Pluto in the calculation of gravity – the least of which is his “ partner ” Charon , who ’s of similar mass .
However , Astrologers calculate Pluto into their maps , and so I thought it would be appropriate to include the force it exerts , too . )
Show the Math
\( 1.33 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8}N + 8.06 \cdot 10 ^{ - 7}N + 5.17 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8}N + 5.72 \cdot 10 ^{ - 7}N + 9.55 \cdot 10 ^{ - 8}N + 3.13 \cdot 10 ^{- 9}N + 1.27 \cdot 10 ^{- 9}N + 1.27 \cdot 10 ^{-13}N=1.5442\cdot 10 ^{- 6}N\ )
Total Force = \( 1.54297\cdot 10 ^{- 6}N\ )
Comparison
So , what do we have ?
The combined forces of the delivery room = \( 1.232\cdot 10 ^{ - 5} N\ )
\( 1.232\cdot 10 ^ { - 5} N\ )
The combined forces of the planets = \( 1.544\cdot 10 ^{ - 6} N\ )
Difference =\( \frac{1.232\cdot 10 ^{ - 5} N} {1.544\cdot 10 ^{-6}} = 8.01 \)
The forces from the delivery room are 8 times bigger than the combined force from the planets , and we have calculated a very conservative estimate .
Proponents of the claim might jump out of their seats and claim the forces are extremely close .
They seem close ( if a factor of 8 is considered close ) but we have to remember a few important issues that show conclusively that the forces from the planets are minuscule compared to the forces exerted on the baby from his immediate surroundings :
The planets do not , ever , line up where they are all as close to Earth as our calculation asserted .
The realistic force from the planets is lower .
Our estimates for both the distances , the amount of people and their weight was very conservative .
In reality , hospitals have a lot more people and staff , much more equipment in the room and directly outside of it .
Hospitals are huge places .
If planets as far as a few billion kilometers exert force on our newborn baby , the MRI machine ( that weighs 50 - 60 times the weight of the doctor , nurse and OB Technician combined ) at some floor below , and the CT machines somewhere in the hospital should be taken into account as well .
Those would dramatically increase the difference between the two forces .
And , one of the most notable point of all :
We ignored the Earth ’s gravity !
We ignored the Earth ’s gravity !
To be fair , I ignored the Earth ’s gravity in both cases , for a very good reason : it absolutely trumps both .
Since it is also coming from the ground , and the other forces are spatially distributed , my goal was to show that even without gravity , the difference exists , and is indeed noticeable .
But the Earth ’s gravity is important here .
The Earth is n’t a perfect sphere ; its radius varies from 6357 km to around 6378 km .
Assume the baby is 6360 km from the center of the Earth .
Show the Math
\( F=6.67 \cdot 10 ^{-11}\frac{m^3}{kg s^2}\frac{3.6 kg \cdot 5.974\cdot 10 ^{24} kg}{( 6.36\cdot 10^{6 } m) ^2}=35.46 \ frac{m\cdot kg}{s ^2}\)
In this case , the force exerted on him by gravity would be \( 35.46 \ mbox {N}\ )
As you can see , this is \ ( 10^6 \ ) times more than the forces exerted by the occupants of the delivery room , and \ ( 10^7 \ ) times more than the force exerted by the planets together .
It ’s a powerful force , gravity .
And there ’s more .
The Earth ’s gravity is n’t constant .
It varies across the surface of the planet ( as the radius varies ) .
We usually use the average rounded number for the gravitational acceleration ( \( 9.806 \mbox{m}/\mbox{s} ^2 \ ) ) but in different locations on the Earth , the number varies .
If the claim astrologers make is that the force from other planets affect a baby ’s personality – and we ’ve seen how small that force is !
– then the change in the Earth ’s gravitation should have an effect too .
In this case , Astrologers should consider the location and elevation of your birth as well as the date and time , to calculate the variations in the Earth ’s gravity .
The next time an Astrologer offers to calculate your chart , you should reminder them about that .
One more thing :
The Labor Itself
We did n’t include this part in the initial calculation , but this is definitely something that we should take into account , since this is likely to be quite a powerful force .
A baby does n’t just “ walk out ” of the womb , it is pushed out by the mother ’s muscles .
If you see any TV shows at all , you know that at the moment where the baby – and doctor – are ready , the doctor will ask the woman to “ Push ! ! ” resulting in the baby ’s head being pushed out ( if all is well ) and the doctor assisting the baby the rest of the way .
This “ push ” and the movement out of the woman ’s womb also exert force on the baby .
On top of that , there is usually a large amount of time during which the woman ’s body exerts force on the baby before it actually comes out .
This would apply pressure on his body ; obviously , it ’s not enough to harm the baby , but it definitely exists .
And labors can be long … long and tedious processes .
Ask your mother how long she was in labor .
So for a large number of hours ( 36 is the average ! ) the baby is subjected to pressure from the mother ’s contractions , and then to the force that pushes him or her out of the womb .
So .. why do n’t Astrologers ask how long your labor lasted ?
Conclusion
There are many things that are plain false in the claims that Astrologers make , and many blogs and sites covered the reasons why .
Now , though , you could see for yourselves how the basic premise – that planets ’ positions , affect the personality trait of a newborn baby – is just silly .
If the planets ’ positions affect the baby ’s personality traits , so should the Doctor ’s position , the OB Technician , the position of the heart monitor , the CT machine down the hall and the size of the hospital and the amount of people in it .
So , unless Astrologers are willing to take these components into account when they produce your “ Chart ” , it seems their claims are plain silly .
And you should tell them that .
Do you have more objects to test ?
Now you can .
Due to popular demand , I ’ve prepared a small tool to help you calculate the force from object at any distance .

I would say the whole whitespace thing of Python is my greatest WTF feature .
True , you more - or - less get used to it after a while and modern editors make it easy to deal with , but even after mostly full time python development for the past year I 'm still convinced it was a Bad Idea .
I 've read all the reasoning behind it but honestly , it gets in the way of my productivity .
Not by much , but it 's still a burr under the saddle .
edit : judging by the comments , some people seem to think I do n't like to indent my code .
That is an incorrect assessment .
I 've always indented my code no matter what the language and whether I 'm forced to or not .
What I do n't like is that it is the indentation that defines what block a line of code is in .
I prefer explicit delimiters for that .
Among other reasons , I find explicit delimiters makes it easier to cut and paste code .
For example , if I have a block indented 4 spaces and paste it at the end of a block that is indented 8 spaces , my editor ( all editors ? ) have no idea if the pasted code belongs to the 8 - space block or the outer block .
OTOH , if I have explicit delimiters it 's obvious which block the code belongs to and how it should be ( re -) indented -- it does so by intelligently looking for block delimiters .
edit 2 : some people who provide comments seem to think this is a feature I hate or that I think makes python a poor language .
Again , not true .
While I do n't like it all that much , that 's beside the point .
The question is about the strangest language feature , and I think this is strange , by virtue of it being something very , very few ( but > 0 ) languages use .
( h/t David at VideoCafe
Grandpa McCrankypants got his chance at the Health Care Summit to voice his " concerns " about health care reform .
Funnily enough , his " concerns " sounded an awful lot like Republican talking points with a splash of electoral sour grapes thrown in .
Thank you , Mr. President and I understand the four categories .
But there is a big category that the people in my state and across this country are deeply concerned about .
And that ’s not just the product that we are examining today , the 2,400 pages , but the process we ’ve gone through to reach that .
Now , both of us during the campaign , promised change in Washington .
In fact , eight times you said that negotiations on health care reform would be conducted with the C - Span cameras .
I ’m glad , more than a year later , that they are here .
Unfortunately , this product was not produced in that fashion .
It was produced behind closed doors .
It was produced with unsavory — and I say that with respect — deal - making .
The “ Louisiana Purchase ” , the funding of $ 300 million for one state , the “ Cornhusker Kickback , ” which is , I understand now , been done away with .
One of the things as provisions of this legislation that was particularly offensive was the carve out for 800,000 for Florida seniors exempt from cuts in Medicare Advantage Program .
There ’s 330,000 seniors under Medicare Advantage in my home state of Arizona .
They ’re deeply concerned about that .
They ’re deeply concerned about the carve - outs for Vermont , Massachusetts , Hawaii , Michigan , Connecticut , $ 100 million for a hospital in Connecticut .
Why ?
Why should that happen ?
They do n’t understand it .
And at the townhall meetings I conduct all over my state , people are angry .
We promised them change in Washington .
And what we got was a process that you and I both said we would change in Washington .
Oh , sweet Jeebus on a popsicle stick .
Can you believe the concern trolling here ?
Hey John , want to know why there was a carve - out for Connecticut ?
Why do n't you ask your bestest buddy , Lieberman , who hemmed and hawed his support in order to get on TV as much as possible .
Are you seriously blaming Obama for the lack of change in the way the Senate must do business ?
Why do n't you look in the mirror and ask yourself how much your party has contributed to that change .
Frankly , responding to McCain 's concern trolling is laughable .
Which is why Obama 's response is the only way to do so .
OBAMA : Let me just make this point , John , because we are not campaigning anymore .
McCAIN : I 'm reminded of that every day .
OBAMA : So we can spend the remainder of the time with our respective talking points going back and forth , we were supposed to be talking about insurance reform .
Obviously I 'm sure that Harry Reid and Chris Dodd and others who went through an exhaustive process through both the House and the Senate with the most hearings , the most debates on the floor , the longest markup in 22 years on each of these bills , will have a response for you .
My concern is , if we do that , we are essentially back on Fox News and MSNBC on the split screen .
My hope would be is that we can just focus on the issues about how we get a bill done .
Suh -nap !
Poor Grampy could only sputter at that point .
BUDAPEST / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Hungary is selling 2 million U.N. - backed carbon emissions permits which have already been surrendered by companies , it said on Friday , raising concern that their buyers could use them again to comply with the EU ’s Emissions Trading Scheme ETS .
The Environment Ministry said late on Thursday that it has signed an agreement to sell the permits to a trading firm which could probably resell them to Japan .
“ The units are certified emission reductions ( CERs ) previously surrendered by Hungarian firms to comply with caps , ” the ministry ’s spokeswoman Boglarka Olt told Reuters .
She said the CERs are covered by the withdrawal of the same amount of AAUs ( assigned amount units ) , credits assigned to governments , which firms are not allowed to use to comply with their caps under the ETS .
The European Commission has warned that CERs , once surrendered by firms to comply with their caps to a member state , can not be re-used for compliance later .
Jos Delbeke , the Commission deputy director general for environment said in a statement that he was concerned about government sales of such CERs even though such sales were possible under the rules of the Kyoto Protocol .
“ However , European legislation does not allow for such CERs to be re-used for compliance in the EU ETS to avoid double counting of emission reductions , ” Delbeke said .
“ Furthermore , a company buying such CERs in good faith and for compliance use in the EU ETS could incur economic losses . ”
Olt said Hungary sold CERs because that was the instrument for which it saw demand .
She said there were guarantees that the buyers would know that the CERs cannot return into the ETS .
“ First , we had it in the contract that the buyer acknowledges that those CERs cannot return , ” she said .
“ Second , the EU has published the list of the withdrawn units , therefore it can be checked that they cannot be sold legally ( in the ETS ) . ”
Miles Austin , director of the Carbon Markets and Investors Association said Hungary ’s deal used a gap in EU regulations by selling CERs and covering it with AAUs which have a lower price .
“ There is the risk that other countries might go to market and buy the AAUs and pocket the price difference , ” he told Reuters .
“ This is the first instance of this happening , ” he said .
“ If this becomes a widespread practice it could double the volume of CERs available to the market which would have an effect on the CER price and therefore the ( ETS trading unit ) EUA price . ”
April 9 , 2010 Update : After CAMERA alerted the news organizations discussed below to Muhammed Faramawi ’s actual fate , some published follow - up pieces .
CNN ’s This Just
In blog informed its readers on April 7 about the boy ’s actual fate .
The Ottawa Citizen did likewise on April 8 .
Al Jazeera , the Independent and the Washington Post have yet to inform readers that earlier reports were incorrect .
April 7 , 2010 – A Palestinian teenager , reported to have been shot “ by Israeli forces ” and “ left bleeding for hours ” before Israel allowed paramedics to evacuate him , has emerged , alive and ( A Palestinian teenager , reported to have been shot “ by Israeli forces ” and “ left bleeding for hours ” before Israel allowed paramedics to evacuate him , has emerged , alive and ( more or less ) unharmed .
The discovery that the boy , Muhammed Faramawi , was in fact held by Egyptian police after entering Egypt through a tunnel from Gaza forced a number of news outlets , including the BBC and New York Times , to backtrack from earlier reports about the “ killing . ”
But disturbingly , other mainstream news organizations that reported the boy had died have failed thus far to update readers .
News Sources that Backtracked
The BBC led a March 31 story with the allegation that Israel killed the boy :
A Palestinian teenager has been shot dead close to southern Gaza ’s border , Palestinians say , as at least five other Gazans were wounded elsewhere .
Muhammad al - Faramawi , 15 , was killed on Tuesday by Israeli fire near Rafah , the Hamas - run health ministry said .
Three days later , a BBC headline announced : “ Gaza boy reported killed returns home alive . ”
The New York Times , too , reported that although it was unclear who actually killed the boy , “ Palestinian officials said the youth , Muhammad al - Farmawi , was killed by Israeli soldiers close to his home in the southern Gaza town of Rafah . ”
The March 30 story added :
By nightfall Tuesday , Palestinian ambulances were still waiting to coordinate their entry into the border area with Israel in order to retrieve the boy ’s body , according to Dr. Muawiya Hassanein , director of emergency medical services in Gaza .
And by Saturday morning , the Times updated its readers :
A 14 - year - old boy thought to have been killed either by Israeli gunfire or from internal Palestinian violence last week turned up unharmed at his family ’s house after trying to sneak into Egypt via smuggler tunnels and being held by Egyptian security officials , his parents said Saturday .
Same with AFP , which reported that “ Gaza medics and witnesses said [ al - Faramawi ] was killed by Israeli forces , ” and subsequently updated its readers with news of the boy ’s arrest and release .
Even partisans , such as the Palestinian Ma’an media agency and anti-Israel activist Nigel Parry , later backtracked from their greatly exaggerated reports of the boy ’s death .
News Sources that Failed to Update Readers
Al Jazeera ’s English Web site , however , seemingly never bothered to alert its readers to the facts after telling them that “ a 15 - year - old Palestinian boy has been killed … after Israeli troops opened fire at Israeli Arabs and Palestinians protesters marking the ‘ Land day . ’ ”
But it was hardly only Al Jazeera that so dramatically disregarded the tenets of professional journalism .
Some Western news outlets , too , told readers of the “ death ” and never looked back .
The Independent , whose coverage of the Middle East conflict might very well be more partisan than that of Al Jazeera , reported , as fact , that “ a Palestinian teenager was killed and 12 wounded when Israeli soldiers opened fire on demonstrators near Gaza ” ( 3/31/10 , World in Brief , Pg. 32 ) .
A March 31 brief in the Washington Post noted that “ the head of emergency medical services in Gaza said ” the boy was killed .
CNN ’s online breaking news blog , This Just In , reported on March 30 :
[ A ] 15 - year - old boy was reported shot to death at the Rafah airport in Gaza , said Muawiya Hassanein , director of ambulance and emergency services in Gaza .
Additional information about the reported death was not immediately available .
And a brief in the Ottowa Citizen cited “ medics and witnesses ” who claimed Israel was responsible for killing the boy .
Apparently none of these news sources published corrections or follow up stories , leaving their audience to believe misinformation about Israel shooting dead the Palestinian teenager .
Muawiya Hassanein
Muawiya Hassanein , the head of emergency services in Gaza , who has long been a cited in the Western media as a source of information on Palestinian casualties , was clearly a central figure in spreading the false allegations .
But in the days after it became clear that Hassanein disseminated false information , Western media outlets continue to unquestioningly cite Hassanein ’s claims about other incidents .
Meanwhile , none of the news organizations that backtracked from their early reports of the supposed killing bothered to ( publicly ) examine how and why they were misled , with the possible exception of the BBC , which quoted Hassanein as explaining , “ We were getting wrong reports from the officer in the field and we announced later in the day that we did not find the body . ”

Whatever else you might say about John Yoo , the former Justice Department lawyer who drafted several memos in 2002 authorizing the CIA to commit torture , you have to admit that he ’s not in the least embarrassed by the condemnation of his peers .
On February 19 , the Justice Department released a set of previously confidential reports by its Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) excoriating
Yoo ’s legal work — but stopped short of referring him for professional discipline by his state bar association .
Since then Yoo has written Op - Eds for The Wall Street Journal and The Philadelphia Inquirer trumpeting his “ victory . ”
In the Wall Street Journal piece , entitled “ My Gift to the Obama Presidency , ” Yoo argued that President Obama owes him a debt of gratitude for “ winning a drawn - out fight to protect his powers as commander in chief to wage war and keep Americans safe . ”
Four days later , in The Philadelphia Inquirer , Yoo called the decision not to refer him for bar discipline “ a victory for the people fighting the war on terror . ”
This is a bit like a child coming home with an F on his report card and telling his parents that they should congratulate him for not getting suspended , or President Clinton proclaiming to Hillary that Congress ’s failure to impeach him was a vindication of his affair with Monica Lewinsky .
The one thing practically everyone interviewed by the OPR agreed about was that Yoo ’s legal work on the torture memos was atrocious .
Bush ’s Attorney General Michael Mukasey called it “ slovenly . ”
Jack Goldsmith , another Republican who headed the Office of Legal Counsel from 2003 to 2004 , said that Yoo ’s August 2002 memo justifying torture by the CIA was “ riddled with error ” and a “ one - sided effort to eliminate any hurdles posed by the torture law . ”
Daniel Levin , who headed the Office of Legal Counsel after Goldsmith left and , like Yoo , was a former clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas , described his reaction upon reading Yoo ’s memo as “ This is insane , who wrote this ? ”
And Stephen Bradbury , who became acting head of the OLC after Levin ’s departure , also under President Bush , and who wrote several memos authorizing torture himself , said of Yoo ’s arguments about presidential power , “ Somebody should have exercised some adult leadership ” and deleted his arguments altogether .
These are the assessments not of human rights advocates or left - wing critics but of Yoo ’s Republican colleagues at the Justice Department .
The OPR itself , which is comprised of career civil servants charged with monitoring ethics violations by department lawyers and is not known for being eager to discipline its own , decided before President Obama took office that Yoo and Jay Bybee , Yoo ’s superior , had violated their ethical duties as attorneys .
After considering responses from Yoo and Bybee , the OPR reaffirmed that Yoo had “ put his desire to accommodate the client above his obligation to provide thorough , objective , and candid legal advice , and …therefore committed intentional professional misconduct . ”
It found that Bybee , who signed the 2002 torture memos and is now a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , had acted in “ reckless disregard ” of the same professional obligation .
It recommended that both lawyers be referred to their respective state bar associations for discipline .
So how can
Yoo portray this process as a victory ?
Only because a single Justice Department official , Associate Deputy Attorney General David Margolis , overruled the OPR ’s considered opinion , finding that while Yoo and Bybee exercised “ poor judgment , ” they did not knowingly provide false advice , and therefore were not guilty of professional misconduct .
But Margolis ’s assessment was in no way an endorsement of Yoo ’s theories or practices .
He described the issue of whether Yoo engaged in misconduct as a “ close question , ” called the memos “ an unfortunate chapter in the history of the Office of Legal Counsel , ” and said he feared that “ John Yoo ’s loyalty to his own ideology and convictions clouded his view of his obligation to his client and led him to author opinions that reflected his own extreme , albeit sincerely held , views of executive power . ”
In short , no one reviewing Yoo ’s work gave it a passing grade .
And he narrowly escaped a referral to his bar association for disciplinary action only because of the decision of a single lawyer in the Justice Department .
The OPR and Margolis largely agreed that Yoo ’s memos contained many serious flaws .
Yoo interpreted the ban on torture to require the intentional infliction of severe pain of the level associated with death and organ failure , a standard he imported from a health benefits statute having no relevance to the issue at hand .
The standard is literally meaningless , as neither death nor organ failure are associated with any particular level of pain .
Yoo appears to have adopted it to permit the CIA to inflict an extraordinarily high degree of pain .
Yoo wrote that an interrogator could inflict even severe pain as long as he did not “ specifically intend ” to do so .
He advised that the president could order outright torture , and that a criminal statute to the contrary could not constrain the president as commander in chief .
( Indeed , he later told the OPR that the president could not even be prohibited from ordering the extermination of an entire village of civilians . )
And he reasoned that an interrogator who engages in torture could defend his behavior by claiming that it was done because of “ necessity ” or because it was required for self - defense — of the nation , not of the interrogator himself .
In both cases Yoo employed unprecedented and virtually unrecognizable versions of these defenses .
( Indeed , the OPR report discloses that even the lawyer who worked under Yoo on the memos initially found his argument about self - defense “ wholly implausible , ” because self - defense requires an imminent threat to the person invoking it , and interrogators faced no such threat . )
The OPR and Margolis were in full accord that these opinions are deeply misguided .
But where the OPR viewed the errors cumulatively as evidence of an extraordinary and ultimately bad - faith effort to contort the law to a predetermined result , Margolis considered the errors one by one , and concluded that no single error “ of itself ” warranted a finding of professional misconduct .
Margolis , in short , missed the forest for the trees .
In a more fundamental sense , however , both the OPR and Margolis failed to confront the real wrong at issue .
They focused exclusively on the manner by which Yoo and Bybee arrived at their result , rather than the result itself .
What is most disturbing about the torture memos is not that they employ strained reasoning or fail to cite this or that authority , but that they do so in the name of authorizing torture and cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment of human beings .
Remarkably , neither the OPR nor Margolis directly considered the illegality of the conduct that was authorized by the memos .
The OPR stated that it “ did not attempt to determine and did not base our findings on whether …the Memos arrived at a correct result . ”
Margolis also did not address whether the conduct authorized was illegal .
But surely that is the central issue .
Why , then , did the OPR and Margolis fail to take up the question of the legality of the brutality itself ?
Almost certainly because doing so would have implicated not only John Yoo and Jay Bybee , but all of the lawyers who approved these methods over the five - year course of their application , including , within the Justice Department , Jack Goldsmith , Daniel Levin , and Stephen Bradbury , Bybee ’s successors as head of the Office of Legal Counsel , and the two attorneys general , John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales .
Notwithstanding their criticism of Yoo ’s errors , all of these men concurred with the basic conclusion of the Yoo and Bybee memos that the tactics being used by the CIA were legitimate .
Goldsmith , Levin , and Bradbury could have reversed the authority that Yoo and Bybee gave the CIA .
They each actively participated in rewriting memos to replace or supplement the initial 2002 memos — but while the subsequent memos were written more carefully , they reached the same bottom line and continued to allow the CIA to inflict waterboarding , sleep deprivation , stress positions , and other illegal tactics on detainees .
Margolis sought to excuse
Yoo and Bybee in part on the basis of the extraordinary circumstances in which they wrote their initial memos , within one year after September 11 .
It ’s not clear why this consideration would warrant approval of torture .
In any case , Yoo and Bybee ’s successors in the Justice Department wrote their memos not in the heat of the moment , but after the program had been in place for years , and had been the subject of substantial criticism by the CIA ’s own inspector general .
He found , among other things , no evidence that the practices in fact obtained useful information that lawful , noncoercive tactics would not have obtained .
Yet the OLC continued to approve of the practices .
Responsibility for the illegal brutality inflicted on CIA and Guantánamo detainees cannot be limited to Yoo and Bybee .
It extends to all those who approved the tactics — even those so eager later to condemn
Yoo ’s reasoning .
And unless we as citizens demand that these lawyers be held to answer for the wrongs done in our name , responsibility extends to all of us , too .
We must continue to insist on accountability — whether in congressional hearings , citizens ’ commissions , civil lawsuits , or the marketplace of ideas .
The essential lesson must be that torture and cruel treatment are not policy options — even when a lawyer is willing to write an opinion blessing illegality .

Tantra Kundalini
According to the philosophy of Tantra , the entire universe is a manifestation of pure consciousness .
In manifesting the universe , this pure consciousness seems to become divided into two poles or aspects , neither of which can exist without the other .
Each requires the other in order to manifest its total nature .
One aspect , Shiva , is masculine , retains a static quality and remains identified with unmanifested consciousness .
Shiva has the power to be but not the power to become or change .
The other aspect , Shakti , is feminine , dynamic , energetic and creative .
Shakti is the Great Mother of the universe , for it is from her that all form is born .
According to Tantra , the human being is a miniature universe .
All that is found in the cosmos can be found within each individual , and the same principles that apply to the universe apply in the case of the individual being .
In human beings , Shakti , the feminine aspect is called Kundalini .
This potential energy is said to rest at the base of the spinal cord .
The object of the Tantric practice of Kundalini - yoga is to awaken this cosmic energy and make it ascend through the psychic centers , the chakras , that lie along the axis of the spine as consciousness potentials .
She will then unite above the crown of the head with Shiva the pure consciousness .
This union is the aim of Kundalini - yoga : a resolution of duality into unity again , a fusion with the Absolute .
By this union the adept attains liberation while living which is considered in Indian life to be the highest experience : an union of the individual with the universe .
Once Kundalini Shakti has ascended to above the crown of the head and merged with Shiva , it is made to reverse its course and return to rest at the base of the spine .
In Tantrism the state of ultimate bliss is a transcendence of dualities male - female , energy - consciousness , Shiva - Shakti …

Hundreds of thousands of women die each year during pregnancy and childbirth Pregnant women in developing countries face the same risk of death as women in the UK did 100 years ago , according to a coalition of campaign groups .
They are using International Women 's Day to call for more action to reduce deaths among women during pregnancy .
They say improving mothers ' health is " the most off - target " of the UN 's eight Millennium Development Goals .
For every 100,000 live births in developing countries , 450 women die during pregnancy or labour .
The coalition , which includes White Ribbon Alliance , Amnesty International and Oxfam , says that in 1910 , 355 women died per 100,000 live births in England and Wales .
In Scotland and the Irish Republic , the rate was higher - at 572 and 531 respectively .
In Ghana today the rate of pregnancy - related deaths is 560 , while in Chad it is 1,500 .
The rate in the UK is now 14 deaths per 100,000 .
There still remains a long way to go for the protection and security of pregnant women and their newborn children
Brigid McConville , Director of White Ribbon Alliance
The comparison has been drawn because it was 100 years ago that International Women 's Day was established .
The UN says although it is difficult to get accurate figures on maternal mortality , very little progress has been made in sub-Saharan Africa - and deaths in southern Asia " remain unacceptably high " .
Brigid McConville , the director of White Ribbon Alliance , which campaigns for safe motherhood , said : " There still remains a long way to go for the protection and security of pregnant women and their newborn children . "
Monday is the official launch of a week of events .
Campaigners will march at the Millennium Bridge in London and lay white roses outside Parliament .
Preventable deaths
Some countries have made progress in improving women 's health - most notably Nepal and Rwanda .

In Mongolia , reduced deaths were achieved by educating women about the signs of complications in pregnancy and by helping them travel to special homes where they could wait to give birth .
Many of the medical problems are easily preventable if , for example , women have access to skilled health workers who can treat infections and use drugs to prevent haemorrhage .
The Millennium Development Goal also envisages preventing deaths that result from complications after unsafe abortions and allowing women access to contraception - to prevent riskier births in teenage mothers and to allow them to space their children .
The issue has become politically more significant in recent years , with the backing of the British Prime Minister 's wife Sarah Brown , who is patron of the White Ribbon Alliance .
The Women Deliver conference in Washington DC in June aims to put increased pressure on world leaders to tackle the problems .
Amnesty International 's UK director Kate Allen said : " It 's clearly been possible to cut back on the rate of maternal deaths here in the UK .
" We need to demonstrate that same level of commitment worldwide . "

Portland , Oregon Tells Karl Rove To Go To Jail .
The World Affairs Council of Oregon arranged a debate between Karl Rove and Dr , Howard Dean on the 10th day of February 2010 in Portland , Oregon .
Almost 100 protestors , most outside and some inside brought the message to Karl Rove that he should be before a judge and not making millions of dollars on a speaking tour with Dean .
There were many who also had a message to Dr. Howard Dean , " You are enabling this man to become rich , and you must stop it now . "
Outside there were representatives from Veterans for Peace , Code Pink , the Pissed Off Grannies , Individuals for Justice , and other groups .
Inside there were about a half dozen members of Individuals for Justice who pooled their money to buy a $ 47 ticket , ( each ) and confront the man we call traitor .
One by one we stood up and yelled from the balconies , " Traitor , sir your are a traitor and should go before a judge . "
One person yelled , " Are you going to bring Hitler here next ? "
You can hear the different people in the theater yelling , the reason it is so dark is that video cameras were not allowed , to ensure compliance they turned the lights out except for the stage area .
One of our members got in a small camera and did the best he could with the restrictions on his ability to record what happened .
We could not get close to the man who outed Valerie Plame , there were guards surrounding the stage and every aisle was closed off to us .
We did make our statement to him and Dr. Dean .
From the upper balcony we flew 25 paper planes with a warrant for his arrest on one side and the charges on the other .
The planes did not make it to the stage where the Rove was , but the rich members of the Council were treated to the warrants .
We ask all people of good will to do the same when they come to their city .
We need to make this duet very uncomfortable when they pick up a big paycheck .
We cannot and did not try to stop Karl Rove from speaking , but made it clear that we wished he would turn himself in to the police and do a Perry Mason ending ; stand up and say to the cops who were protecting him from the peacemakers , " Yes .
I did it , arrest me ! "
Enjoy the video and pass it on to all people who honor Justice and the " Rule of Law ! "

Stephen Colbert : " Sarah Palin is a F** king Retard " ( PHOTOS , VIDEO )
Sarah Palin is being ridiculed for using her own personal hand - o- prompter to provide talking points during the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville , while knocking Barack Obama as the " charismatic guy with a teleprompter . "
The crib notes were : energy , budget tax cuts , and lift American spirits .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs took an opportunity to mock Palin during a press briefing .
Palin's use of her palm as a cheat sheet really irked political satirist Stephen Colbert .
He took up the discussion on his show last night , pointedly mocking her speech .
The comedian went on to revisit the subject of Palin 's call for Rahm Emanuel 's firing because he used the word " retard " while excusing Rush Limbaugh 's use of the same word because it was merely satire .
At that point Colbert offered up this nugget : " Sarah Palin is a f*** king retard . "
Another hot political jewel today is the Miss Me Yet ?
Bush billboard .
The signage depicts a smirking George W. Bush giving a little wave .
Check out Palin palm reading photos and the Colbert video below .
Prof. Noam Chomsky on “ Washington Report ” , a Pakistani program , expands on how :
the so - called ‘ War on Terror ’ is a literal war of terror from the Reagan Administration ’s declaration to the Bush Administration ’s ‘ re - declaration ’ ;
the motivations behind the slogans of ‘ hope ’ and ‘ change ’ coming from little more than ‘ selling toothpaste and why issues are marginalized in electoral politics ;
Obama ’s continuity of U.S. ‘ consistent support of the militarization of Pakistan ’ over liberating Pakis to ‘ maintain control of the region ’ using the Pak government as ‘ one of its agents ’ ;
Obama ’s strategy in expanding the war into Pakistan will obviously radicalize the population ;
the ‘ methods of subversion ’ imperial powers are reliant on the submission of occupied populations to deliberately ‘ undermine democracy ’ .

Celebrated physicist Stephen Hawking is looking forward to this summer in Ontario but does n’t intend to immigrate to Canada , his spokesman said Wednesday .
“ It ’s definitely not true .
It ’s absurd , ” Sam Blackburn told the Star from Cambridge University , where he works with the best - selling author of A Brief History of Time .
Blackburn also said he “ has n’t noticed Stephen saying anything about ” cuts to university budgets and their impact on scientific research .
Britain ’s Daily Mail on Tuesday reported that Hawking intended to leave Cambridge University after nearly 50 years and “ move to Canada in protest over government cuts . ”
“ It is ironic , ” the Mail noted , that Hawking “ would leave Cambridge , which has arguably done more to advance the understanding of science than any university in the world , ” citing Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton .
Hawking does intend , as announced last week , to spent two months this summer at the Perimeter Institute in Waterloo , Ont .
“ If all goes according to plan , this could be an annual trip , ” Blackburn said , reinforcing a regular summer visit that Perimeter and Hawking had also announced earlier .
The famed physicist was supposed to visit Waterloo last summer but the trip was cancelled because of his health .
“ His health is pretty much fine ” now , said Blackburn .
While he was n’t seriously ill last summer , “ his doctors are extremely cautious ” about Hawking ’s travels because he is almost entirely paralyzed by a motor - neuron disease .
Perimeter was created in 1999 by Research in Motion co-founder Mike Lazaridis and is supported by millions from Lazardis , fellow co-founder Jim Balsillie and other private donors , as well as federal , provincial and city money .
Its current director is Dr. Neil Turok , a former Cambridge colleague of Hawking ’s .
When Hawking accepted its Distinguished Research Chair in November 2008 , Hawking said , “ The Institute ’s twin focus , on quantum theory and gravity , is very close to my heart .
I look forward to building a growing partnership . ”
Turok called Hawking ’s appointment “ a new phase in our recruitment that will see leading scientists from around the world establish a second ‘ research home ’ at Perimeter Institute . ”
Researchers at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Medical Center and the University of Maryland School of Medicine have conducted a study on prion disease and found that transmissible spongiform encephalopathy ( TSE ) can be induced without an outside catalyst like a virus .
TSE ( also known as prion diseases ) are a group of progressive conditions affecting the brain and nervous systems of many animals and humans .
The conditions include Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( the human form of mad cow disease ) , Gerstmann - Sträussler - Scheinker syndrome , fatal familial insomnia and kuru , all forming a spectrum of overlapping signs and symptoms caused by a myriad of tiny holes in the cortex that give it the appearance of a sponge .
The disease impairs brain functions leading to both mental and physical deterioration over time .
Using a synthetic prion protein made in E. coli , the researchers induced a new form of TSE .
Their study findings -- published in January 2010 issue of Acta Neuropathol -- indicate a slow progression of the disease after the observance of first clinical signs , which is typical of how the disease unfolds in both humans and large animals , than in smaller animals such as rodents .
One of the study 's lead researchers , Robert Rohwer , PhD , director of Molecular Neurovirology Laboratory at the VA Maryland Health Care System and an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine , says the result is an " important milestone in establishing that the native wild - type prion protein is sufficient to induce prion disease in normal wild - type hosts .
The interpretation of previous transmissions with synthetic prion proteins has been confounded by the use of mutant proteins and mutant host recipients subject to spontaneous disease . "
This result , Rohwer said , does not explain the many discrepancies " that have supported skeptics of the prion hypothesis like myself , and there is enormous work yet to be done to reconcile these apparent inconsistencies .
However , the new insights , tools and focus provided by these discoveries promise to greatly accelerate the pace of those efforts . "
Rohwer noted that the disease being induced " was itself unique and fascinating " and may prove valuable as a window on its progression in humans , cattle and sheep .
Rohwer , together with Ilia Backakov , PhD , an associate professor at the School of Medicine and director of the Prion Insitute at the University of Maryland 's Biotechnolgical Institute , inoculated Golden Syrian hamsters with synthetic E.coli recombinant prion proteins , while at the same time inoculating other hamsters with comprehensive slightly altered controls .
During this first passage , all but two of the hamsters survived to old age ( 18 months ) without any sign of disease .
The researchers investigated the brains of each hamster at 18 months old for evidence of the TSE infection , finding that one animal showed definite signs of infection and one suspicious .
They homogenized the brains of both the possibly infected and apparently uninfected animals that had been inoculated with prion protein and some control group hamsters , and then inoculated the homogenates in new animals .
Again the animals appeared normal for more than a year after the inoculation , but then the animals began developing symptoms of TSE disease .
" There had been infection in the first passage , but the disease progression was so slow it did n't have time to advance to a symptomatic form within the hamster 's lifespan , " said Rohwer .
In the hamsters from the second passage , a higher concentration of infectivity meant the infection process started at a higher level , causing the animals to reach a symptomatic stage of disease before their life 's end .
The research resulted in two findings , one being the ability of synthetic wild - type prion protein to induce prion disease in normal wild - type hosts and the other being the development of a new strain of hamster prion disease with a unique presentation for rodents that may prove valuable for investigating the longer duration TSE illnesses of larger animals like humans and cattle .
Are we mistaken about the mission of the Catholic Church ?
Something about promoting family and the well - being of children ?
We already know this not to be true , based on the Washington D.C. Archdiocese shutting down its adoption program and spousal benefits for employees .
And now comes the story of a preschool boy in Boulder , denied re-admission because his parents are homogays .
It ’s not just students who must adhere to the Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School ’s religious teachings , but parents too .
Otherwise , think how awkward PTA meetings would be .
The student ’s parents are two women and the Denver Archdiocese says their homosexual relationship violates the school ’s beliefs and policy .
According to teachers at Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School , a meeting was held Tuesday to discuss the issue .
The staff was told a student would not be allowed to re-enroll because of his or her parents ’ sexual orientation .
The staff members were also told not to talk to the media .
In a statement sent to 9NEWS , the Archdiocese said , “ Homosexual couples living together as a couple are in disaccord with Catholic teaching . ”
According to the Archdiocese , parents who enroll their kids at Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School are expected to follow the Catholic Church ’s beliefs .
“ No person shall be admitted as a student in any Catholic school unless that person and his / her parent ( s ) subscribe to the school ’s philosophy and agree to abide by the educational policies and regulations of the school and Archdiocese , ” the statement said .
Because this student ’s parents are homosexual , the Archdiocese says they were in clear violation of the school ’s policy .
School staff members , who asked to remain anonymous , say they are disgusted by the Archdiocese ’s decision .
One employee said she could not believe a student will have to suffer because of his or her parents ’ sexual orientation .
Of course , we all know who ’s really suffering by these parents ’ homosexuality : Jesus .

( Thanks , Jim ! )
Adorning yourself in fake goods , be it a replica Gucci handbag or knock - off Armani sunglasses , makes a statement .
It says that you want to feel , or be seen as , wealthier than you actually are .
It signals an aspiration towards a richer lifestyle .
Of course , such products can’t actually change a person ’s status , but a new study suggests that they can change people ’s behaviour , and for the worse .
Francesca Gino from the University of North Carolina has shown that counterfeit products actually make people behave more dishonestly .
They cheat more in tests and they judge others as unethical with greater abandon .
Even worse , they ’re completely unaware of this impact .
This effect is heavily ironic .
People often buy fake goods to look good to other people .
But Gino ’s study shows that these products can affect our moral choices precisely because they make us look worse to ourselves .
As she writes , “ Feeling like a fraud makes people more likely to commit fraud . ”
In her first experiment , Gino told volunteers that they were going to wear a pair of real of fake designer sunglasses while doing certain tasks .
Their job was to test out the glasses .
In reality , all the eyewear on offer was real and each cost a princely $ 300 .
But even though everyone had the same shades , the volunteers who thought they were wearing the fake ones were more likely to cheat in the tests .
First , they were given a problem - solving task where they would be paid for each correct answer .
The answer sheets were anonymously posted into a box and the recruits had to write how many questions they had solved .
As far as they knew , they could make up any number they liked but , in reality , Gino had coded the worksheets to give away their identity .
She found that 71 % of the recruits who wore fake sunglasses cheated in the test , overplaying their own successes .
In contrast , just 30 % of those adorned in authentic shades resorted to lies .
Neither group actually scored better or worse than the other .
In a second test , they saw a square divided in two down its diagonal and had to say which of the two sides had more spots .
If they said the left side , they received half a cent but if they said the right side , they got fifty cents instead .
This presents a stark conflict between answering truthfully and earning the most money .
And over time , the recruits who wore fake sunglasses ( but not the real ones ) became more and more likely to choose the right side , even when there were patently more dots on the left .
For her next experiment , Gino showed that counterfeit goods can change how people view the actions of others .
Again , 79 students were given sunglasses that were ostensibly real or fake .
This time , after allegedly test - driving the eyewear , they had to fill in a questionnaire about moral behaviour .
Compared to those wearing real sunglasses , volunteers who wore counterfeits said that people they knew were more likely to act dishonestly , from taking home office stationery to inflating an expenses claim .
And given fictional scenarios involving moral choices , the counterfeit - wearers were more likely than their peers to think that other people would behave unethically .
It seems that people who wear fake goods interpret the actions of others through a lens of dishonesty .
What ’s behind this change of heart ?
To find out , Gino repeated the sunglasses study with 100 fresh volunteers , and a few important twists .
This time , some of the recruits were n’t told anything about the sunglasses or whether they were genuine .
They also had to complete a questionnaire that analysed how they felt about themselves , by asking them how far they agreed with statements such as “ Right now , I feel as if I do n’t know myself very well ” or “ Right now , I feel out of touch with the real me . ”
All the volunteers did the same problem - solving test from the first experiment and they behaved much like the first lot did .
Among those who thought they wore fake shades , 74 % cheated , while just 30 % of those who thought they wore real ones did .
Out of those who were n’t told anything , 42 % cheated .
The questionnaires revealed that these differences were fuelled by the volunteers ’ feelings about themselves .
Those who wore the supposedly fake sunglasses felt personally less genuine than their peers .
Because they felt like fakes , they were more likely to behave unethically .
The icing on this psychological cake is that people have no idea about this effect .
When Gino asked 86 random students about the impact of fake goods , they did n’t predict any consequences on ethical behaviour .
Even when asked about the experiments themselves , they did n’t think that the nature of the sunglasses would affect the volunteers ’ propensity to cheat on their tests .
Gino fully admits that the real world is very different to laboratory settings but , nonetheless , she is concerned about the psychological impact of counterfeit goods at a societal level .
As she says , “ Individuals who buy counterfeits for themselves or give them to others may believe that they are simply getting similar products for less money , but in fact may be paying a price in terms of their long - term morality . “

Herschel ’s latest image reveals the formation of previously unseen large stars , each one up to ten times the mass of our Sun .
These are the stars that will influence where and how the next generation of stars are formed .
The image is a new release of ‘ OSHI ’ , ESA ’s Online Showcase of Herschel Images .
The bright smudges are dusty cocoons hiding massive protostars .
These will eventually become stars containing around ten times the mass of the Sun .
The small spots near the centre and in the redder regions of the image are lower mass protostars , similar in mass to the Sun .
The Rosette Nebula resides some 5000 light - years from Earth and is associated with a larger cloud that contains enough dust and gas to make the equivalent of 10 000 Sun - like stars .
The Herschel image shows half of the nebula and most of the Rosette cloud .
The massive stars powering the nebula lie to the right of the image but are invisible at these wavelengths .
Each colour represents a different temperature of dust , from – 263 ºC ( only 10 ºC above absolute zero ) in the red emission to – 233 ºC in the blue .
ESA ’s Herschel space observatory collects the infrared light given out by dust .
This image is a combination of three infrared wavelengths , colour - coded blue , green and red in the image , though in reality the wavelengths are invisible to our eyes .
It was created using observations from Herschel ’s Photoconductor Array Camera and Spectrometer ( PACS ) and the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver ( SPIRE ) .
Herschel is showing astronomers such young , massive protostars for the first time , as part of the ‘ Herschel imaging survey of OB Young Stellar objects ’ .
Known as HOBYS , the survey targets young OB - class stars , which will become the hottest and brightest stars .
“ High - mass star - forming regions are rare and further away than low - mass ones , ” says Frédérique Motte , Laboratoire AIM Paris - Saclay , France .
So astronomers have had to wait for a space telescope like Herschel to reveal them .
It is important to understand the formation of high - mass stars in our Galaxy because they feed so much light and other forms of energy into their parent cloud they can often trigger the formation of the next generation of stars .
When astronomers look at distant galaxies , the star - forming regions they see are the bright , massive ones .
Thus , if they want to compare our Galaxy to distant ones they must first understand high - mass star - formation here .
“ Herschel will look at many other high - mass star - forming regions , some of them building stars up to a hundred times the mass of the Sun , ” says Dr Motte , who plans to present the first scientific results from HOBYS at ESA ’s annual ESLAB symposium to be held in the Netherlands , 4 – 7 May .

At a special screening for the comic adaptation of Mark Millar 's KICK - ASS , the privileged audience had to relinquish phones , camera and the like in an effort to stifle leaked content on the internet .
Lord Shaper , a popular comic book internet blogger who was in attendance , has posted a detailed , spoiler - free review of the film .
Here are a few excepts from his website , The Furnace : " I went in without any expectations of the movie , I ’ve watched a few of the trailers and thought there were amusing but that is an understatement about this movie .
From the opening scene of the winged hero on the rooftop that we ’ve all seen from the trailers to just keep on running at full ball .
I loved the way the movie put the idea first up of how would a superhero work in the real world and what peoples reactions would be to see a masked marauder walking down the street .
You have to love when people see Kick Ass for the first time and just start laughing .
The pacing of the movie also worked really well it slowed down where it needed to , seeing the mistakes that Kick Ass makes and the outcomes of people questioning his sexual orientation are played up to perfection .
Then we get to the action .
The fight scenes are over the top but that does n’t detract from the movie at all as everything in it is over the top and they let you know about it at every point they get .
Hit Girl is the best at that .
I do n’t know if it is just fantastic choreography or the fact someone some young is doing something so violent but it all comes together here .
Aaron Johnston was fantastic as David / Kick Ass …
There was a great level of wannabe that came across between him trying to be a superhero compared to Big Daddy and Hit Girl who have been training for it all of their lives .
Nicolas Cage blew me away with his performance .
I think this is his best performance that I ’ve seen from him .
From the twisted caring father who is teaching his daughter to take a gunshot to when he puts on the costume , adds the handlebar mustache and puts on the William Shatner / Adam West Batman voice so people do n’t know it ’s him .
Chloe Moretz has to be the star of the show .
She plays Hit Girl perfectly with the ability to get every one liner and she pulls of the action every time .
I ’m sure that there will be a flood of Hit Girls on the Cosplay scene very soon !
" He ends his review by calling it an overall ' fun movie ' and definitely foresees a sequel .

Forget iris and fingerprint scans -- scanning noses could be a quicker and easier way to verify a person 's identity , according to scientists at the University of Bath .
With worries about illegal immigration and identity theft , authorities are increasingly looking to using an individual 's physical characteristics , known as biometrics , to confirm their identity .
Unlike other facial features used for biometrics , such as eyes or ears , noses are difficult to conceal and also are n't changed much by facial expression .
Dr Adrian Evans and Adrian Moorhouse , from the University 's Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering , decided to investigate whether images of people 's noses could be used to recognise individuals .
They used a photographic system called PhotoFace ( http://www.uwe.ac.uk/cems/research/groups/mvl/index.shtml), developed by researchers at the University of the West of England in Bristol , to scan the 3D shape of volunteers ' noses and used computer software to analyse them according to six main nose shapes : Roman , Greek , Nubian , Hawk , Snub and Turn - up .
Instead of using the whole shape of the nose , the researchers used three characteristics in their analysis : the ridge profile , the nose tip , and the nasion or section between the eyes at the top of the nose .
advertisement
They combined the curvature of the ridge with the ratios of the tip and nasion widths and ridge length .
This combined ratio was then used to distinguish between a database of 36 people .
Whilst the researchers used a relatively small sample , they found that nose scanning showed good potential for use as a biometric , with a good recognition rate and a faster rate of image processing than with conventional biometric techniques such as whole face recognition .
Dr Evans said : " Noses are prominent facial features , and yet their use as a biometric has been largely unexplored .
We wanted to find out how good they could be at recognising individuals from a database .
" There 's no one magic biometric -- irises are a powerful biometric , but can be difficult to capture accurately and can easily be obscured by eyelids or glasses .
" Noses , however , are much easier to photograph and are harder to conceal , so a system that recognises noses would work better with an uncooperative subject or for covert surveillance .
advertisement
" We 've only tried this on a small sample of people , but the technique certainly shows potential , perhaps to be used in combination with other identification techniques . "
Professor Melvyn Smith led the team at the University of the West of England ( UWE ) who developed the PhotoFace system .
He said : " This collaborative project with Bath is very exciting work with great potential .
PhotoFace is an innovative 3D face data capture system developed as part of an EPSRC funded project involving UWE , Imperial College , the Home Office ( Scientific Development Branch ) and General Dynamics Ltd .
" It works by taking photos lit by a flash from several different angles so that four images are taken in very rapid succession of every point on the face , each under different controlled lighting conditions .
" The technique is known as photometric stereo and UWE's Machine Vision Laboratory is one of only three UK centres with expertise in this area .
The software then works out the colour , surface orientation and depth of each point on the face by analysing the shading within each of the photos .
" The technique is able to achieve a level of detail that is beyond current competing technologies and can be extended to a myriad of other applications , ranging from industrial surface inspection to cosmetics . "
The researchers plan in the future to build up a larger database of noses to test and refine the software to see if it can pick out individuals from a larger group of people , or distinguish between relatives from the same family .

Studie Ab 2015 fehlen Deutschland Arbeitskräfte
Schon bald sieht es düster aus auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt - und zwar für die Unternehmen .
Vor einem massiven Arbeitskräftemangel warnt laut Zeitungsbericht eine Studie der Unternehmensberatung McKinsey .
In fünf Jahren bieten demnach Firmen mehr Jobs an , als sie besetzen können .
THE nation 's industrial umpire has ruled that a long - term employee who was legitimately sacked for repeated safety breaches must be reinstated and paid compensation because of his poor education and poor job prospects .
In the latest ruling to concern business , Fair Work Australia found the worker had engaged in " relatively serious misconduct " , but ruled the sacking harsh due to his length of service and the fact he was a poorly educated middle - aged family man , The Australian reported .
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the ruling sent the wrong message , and " really exposes employers to double jeopardy " .
" Here we have an employee repeatedly failing to observe health safety obligations , a valid reason for dismissal found to have existed , but the company still found to have acted unlawfully , " said the chamber 's workplace policy director , David Gregory .
" It makes it very difficult for employers to try and work their way through this maze of what seem to be competing obligations contained in different pieces of legislation .
As workplace relations continued to feature prominently in national politics yesterday , senior union leader Joe de Bruyn declared Tony Abbott 's plan to scrap minimum shift requirements for young workers as " worse than Work Choices " .

Sacked for taking glasses off
During a shutdown at Norske Skog Paper Mills in Albury last September , Paul Quinlivan and a colleague were cleaning out a tank that captured staples from recycled pulp , when he repeatedly removed his safety glasses and was told four times by a manager to put them back on .
The tribunal accepted that his repeated failure to wear the safety glasses and his disdainful and abusive response to management amounted to serious misconduct .
But the tribunal said the sacking was a " disaster " for Mr Quinlivan , taking into account that he had worked at the mill for 20 years , was married with two daughters , aged nine and 11 , and had a mortgage of about $ 70,000 .
" If the applicant had substantially lesser service ; had not been a middle - aged man with very poor employment prospects for whom the dismissal has such serious personal and economic consequences ; or if it had been brought home to him at any time on 2 September , 2009 , that a further breach would have serious consequences , I would not have concluded that the dismissal was harsh , " vice - president Michael Lawler found .
He said Mr Quinlivan should have been warned rather than sacked .
He ordered his reinstatement and that he be paid $ 16,000 .

T oo often in politics , principle is the hapless victim of expediency .
In the struggle to pry Afghanistan documents from Stephen Harper 's grasp , principle never had a chance .
Paying former Supreme Court justice Frank Iacobucci up to $ 600 an hour to review thousands of files is a shrewd solution to a vexing problem .
It buys Conservatives time at public expense and adds the patina of Iacobucci 's lustrous reputation to an otherwise shabby effort to wrap Afghan prisoner abuse documents in a national security blanket .
But the Iacobucci appointment carries other , more profound implications for this country 's deconstructing democracy .
Most significantly , it chips more from the cornerstone principle that the Prime Minister is accountable to Parliament .
In England , that test of wills was resolved in Parliament 's favour when King Charles I was beheaded in 1649 .
In 21st century - Canada the same effect is achieved more civilly and with less bloodshed when a prime minister loses Commons support .
Twice in a little over a year , MPs put this country on that course .
Twice the Prime Minister has thwarted their will by padlocking Parliament .
Conservatives consider both qualified successes .
One saved the government from a fatally flawed coalition , the other put on hold the rising threat that Parliament would find the Prime Minister in contempt for ignoring its majority December vote demanding the documents be released .
For opposition parties , there 's a catch in that apparent humiliation :
It serves Harper surprisingly well .
Conservatives would almost certainly consider censure a loss of confidence , plunging the country into an election fought , at least in part , over the red herring issue of support for the troops .
Opposition parties do n't want to go into a campaign defending their patriotism .
So it 's extremely unlikely that an NDP effort to reinforce Parliament 's supremacy , or a less well - known , lone - wolf effort by one Liberal MP , will gain the needed traction .
In one way , that 's a shame .
A loss of Commons confidence is the appropriate response when a prime minister tries to seize powers that once belonged to monarchs .
In another , it 's simply pragmatic .
Even if the government falls over disregard for democratic principle , the central election issues will be leadership , jobs and the economy .
On those , wobbly Liberals are in no hurry to test their strength .
Iacobucci 's appointment reflects that dynamic .
It 's a fig leaf that lets Liberals in particular ignore naked acceptance of the Prime Minister 's refusal to bow to Parliament .
Whatever purpose it serves , Iacobucci 's review is not an inquiry .
Stripped of spin , he's on the payroll to provide the most prestigious legal advice possible to a justice minister already insisting that releasing uncensored documents would damage national interests .
Lost in Rob Nicholson 's rationale is that voters send representatives to Parliament to protect those same interests .
It 's MPs , not the prime minister or his cabinet , who decide what is acceptable to Canadians and their decision can't be reached wisely in an information dark hole .
True , opposition parties are prone to partisan politicking .
But so , too , are those in power .
If parliamentarians can't be trusted to protect Canada 's interests then the country and its democracy are far down a slippery slope .
Prime Ministers since Pierre Trudeau have methodically shifted authority into their own hands .
One by one , principles have been sacrificed to expediency and precedents set .
By ducking the responsibility to hold Harper accountable for what happened in Afghanistan on his watch , Parliament is allowing the Prime Minister to drift that much further beyond its oversight , discipline and control .

Mark O’Donnell , chairman of the Zambian Tourism Council , stated that the refusal by CITES to allow Zambia to sell ivory may increase poaching .
The Zambian Wildlife Authority ( ZAWA ) which needs money to maintain its conservation programs is worried that without the ability to sell ivory as a source of revenue they will not be able to effectively regulate poaching .
He stated , “ This is all well and good but does not take into account the facts and does not address the needs of ZAWA to obtain revenue .
ZAWA needs revenue to enable good conservation programs to be put into place so that wildlife management improves .
With better management animal populations will increase and our ability to attract visitors to Zambia will improve , ” O’Donnell said .
“ It is unfortunate that those countries that do not support Zambia are not offering alternatives to us .
Where is the money going to come from to run better conservation programs ?
The refusal to allow Zambia to market her legal ivory may indeed lead to higher levels of poaching as there is simply a lack of resources . ”
“ ZAWA has an area of 250,000 square kilometers to manage .
This is larger than many countries in Europe .
ZAWA only has a limited number of personnel to do this .
There is a lack of equipment , logistics and support to enable this to be done , ” said O’Donnell .
“ I find it very frustrating that delegates to meetings such as CITES do not fully appreciate the problems associated with wildlife management and conservation in Zambia and chose to sit and pass judgement against Zambia without offering credible alternatives .
I think this is a very shortsighted approach .
Rather than just be negative towards Zambia ’s proposals , it would have been far more useful to come forward with money and ideas that would have enabled us to do a better job in this area ”

Jason Moreau , of Citra , Florida , is a 26 year old decorated veteran of the United States Marines .
During his service , Jason developed a life threatening condition involving his kidneys known as Henoch - Schönlein Purpura ( HSP ) .
He was honorably discharged in September 2006 and received a 100 % service connected disability due to his kidney condition .
Jason ’s condition took a significant turn for the worse in February 2007 , when after months on dialysis he had to undergo a kidney transplant .
Jason ’s father was the donor .
There were numerous complications with the transplant including cellular rejection , a severed artery , and C - Diff colitis .
In September 2008 , due to the fact that Jason received a new kidney , the VA implausibly proposed reducing his service connected disability from 100 % to 0 % and to reclaim the benefits that they have paid in the past year .
Tragically , Jason was told in February 2009 that the HSP is now affecting his new kidney .
As such , he no longer is a candidate for a new organ and it is only a matter of time before the HSP destroys the donor kidney .
New York trial attorney Mark Kujawski agreed to handle the matter pro bono .
On May 13 , 2009 , Moreau , along with Mr. Kujawski and his mother Sharon , attended a hearing in Bay Pines , Florida , on the VA proposal to cut his benefits .
Over the next 10 months while Jason and his family waited for a decision , his condition continued to deteriorate .
Jason has developed a chronic viral condition and now requires surgery every month at the Mayo Clinic .
Despite his failing condition , the intervention of Congressman Cliff Sterns , and the continued efforts of Mr. Kujawski and Jason ’s family , on March 1 , 2010 , the VA issued a proposal to reduce Jason ’s benefits in half .
Jason ’s parents continue to confront the economic burden on top of the emotional strain , using their retirement savings .
Jason , a fighter through and through , and feeling horribly about the toll he is placing on his family , is actually trying to find a job despite his dire health condition and this seemingly endless battle with the VA .

This is a general posting account for VT
Steven Spielberg asked John Underkoffler to help design a futuristic human computer interface for a movie that takes place in the year 2054 .
Little did Spielberg know that Underkoffler would adapt that concept from Minority Report and develop it into a real system 35 years ahead of schedule .
Called g-speak , the system is a ‘ spatial operating environment ’ that allows you to point and gesture to control and move files across multiple displays .
It ’s absolutely incredible looking .
Underkoffler and his fellows at Oblong have already placed several of these systems in branches of the US government and Fortune 500 companies .
The real unveiling , however , came at the 2010 TED Conference earlier in February , where g- speak and the spatial operating environment blew people ’s minds .
Underkoffler said that he thought this system could be included with new computers in just five years .
We have multiple video demonstrations of g - speak below so you can see for yourself .
Be warned : you ’re going to want one .
Gesture technology is going to be big in 2010 .
We ’ve already discussed how Hitachi , Toshiba , and Microsoft are all producing breakthrough home systems that utilize your hands ( and body ) as controllers .
That ’s just the first level of body - digital interaction , however .
G - speak lets you go deeper .
Cut and paste across multiple displays with multiple users , highlight and edit files as they play in real time , use your hands to move through space and time .
Just watch :
Carlton Sparrell , Oblong ’s VP of Product Development , spoke at MIT ’s Media Lab back in October 2009 .
He highlighted how g- speak will allow users at multiple interfaces , in multiple locations , to share files in an intuitive manner as everyone jointly edits them .
Sparrell ’s talk included the following demo video of g- speak that was created in 2008 .
As cool as this system looks , it ’s specifications are even more incredible .
G - speak tracks hands with 0.1 mm spatial resolution at 100 Hz !
Unless you ’re a virtuoso musician or a brain surgeon I doubt your motor control is anywhere near so precise .
In the spatial operating environment , that resolution is put to good use : every pixel has a physical space associated with it .
Every single pixel !
In this way , a user can interact with anything she sees , manipulating virtual objects in the same area as they appear .
Oblong even says that the system can work with 3D displays without any updates to its software .
This goes a long way towards directly translating the digital world into the physical one .
Strangely , I can’t find much information on how g- speak does this .
Users must wear special gloves , which you can see in the videos , and these gloves provide some assistance in tracking gesture recognition .
Beyond that , Oblong is n’t very forthcoming as to what cameras , accelerometers , or wireless communications are used .
Hopefully these hardware details will become more accessible after Underkoffler ’s TED video is released .
While demonstration videos are great , you have to wonder how the average user will feel trying to learn to work in a spatial operating environment .
Luckily , at the same time that Sparrell was discussing Oblong ’s ambitious plans at MIT , other members of the company were experimenting with real world uses .
Here we can see a virtual pottery application where the artist shapes the digital clay and then has a 3D frame of his work .
Notice how the user is still adapting to some aspects of the gesture language but feels confident in others .
Let ’s take a look at Underkoffler ’s original concept for spatial operating environments in these clips from Minority Report .
Feel free to skip around .
Watching the video above , it ’s clear that g- speak is an adaptation of the Minority Report idea , or vice versa .
Gloves , gestures , huge shared display spaces – it ’s all there .
We also get a good idea of how Oblong may envision future extensions of the spatial operating environment .
Anyone familiar with Apple ’s iPad could see how tablet computing could easily attach to the g - speak concept as a means of taking one ’s work on the go .
In the clips , a data pad is even used as a means of exchanging files between systems .
You also get the sense that the environment works best when coupled with a massively powerful graphics engine so that every movement of the user can correspond to instantaneous changes in displayed digital information .
Curiously , what you do n’t see is any inclusion of haptics .
Those special gloves could easily be fitted with vibrating rings to give users the sensation of touching what they are seeing .
Also , none of these demos truly give me an idea of who the ultimate user of this product will be .
Does Oblong envision g- speak as a universal replacement for mouse and keyboard ?
Underkoffler mentioned at TED that he thought these systems may be included with new computers in less than five years .
If so , how are we going to use g- speak ?
Most of us are n’t video editors , or responsible for coordinating military missions , or cops sifting through the visual memories of psychics – we just edit word processor files , browse the web , and watch media .
Those tasks do n’t require advanced human - computer interfaces .
But maybe they will .
Maybe developments in these gesture technologies will change the way in which we use our computers , making our browsing more multi-space , multi- level , and multi-tasking .
It ’s hard to say .
With SDKs available for Linux and Mac OSX developers , it could be that third parties take this platform and discover its ultimate end -use .
Maybe we ’ll see something closer to a personal augmented reality system like Pranav Mistry ’s Sixth Sense .
In any case , g - speak and the spatial operating environment look so frakkin’ cool that I can’t imagine it not succeeding on at least some level .
Who would n’t want to have access to the technology of 2054 , today ?

So this is what all those " yo ' network 's so slow " jokes were about .
The Wall Street Journal has today penned a story framing AT&T 's hefty recent investments in building out its network as a defensive move against a " huge exodus to Verizon " when its rival gets the iPhone .
These preventative measures include working with Apple on streamlining the iPhone 's network load , and infrastructure spending that is expected to be $ 2 billion more in 2010 than in 2009 .
The WSJ claimed yesterday that Apple was working on a CDMA version of its iPhone that could hit mass production as early as September .
However , concluding that the iPhone on Verizon is a done deal seems something of a stretch .
Sprint has shown a remarkable ability to attract cutting edge phones , and China Unicom 's exclusivity agreement is about to hit its precarious first anniversary about the time this handset is set to roll out .
Still , setting aside the analyst blather and extrapolation , the picture that emerges is of AT&T feverishly patching up its service offering in the face of a rapidly expiring exclusivity arrangement .
You know how every time you say , " I do n't believe in fairies " , a fairy dies ?
Well , every time you say " Who is Justin Bieber ? " , Justin Bieber only grows stronger .
I could begin by firing out some essential facts about this riot - causing teen singing sensation – this darling of the tween tweetoisie – who has just announced his first world tour .
I could tell you how he is Usher 's protege , how his favourite colours are blue and purple , how his favourite sandwich is turkey , how he 's scared of spiders , and how he stands at 5ft 3 ½in at the time of going to press .
But let 's start with an experiment .
Visit the front page of Twitter , right now , and I predict with absolute confidence that Justin Bieber will be trending .
That 's a helluva presumption , you might say .
How can she possibly predict what 's going to be trending at the precise moment I 'm bored and desperate enough to read this so - called article ?
The trick , my ducks , is that I do it with mirrors .
The fact of the matter is that Justin Bieber is always trending .
He 's the canary in the coalmine of spring / summer 2010 social networking , and if you suddenly do n't see his name up there , I wish you best of luck with your Rapture arrangements .
My non-scientific research tells me that one half of Justin 's Twitter traffic is caused by excitable tween girls cyber - fainting , while the other half is caused by people asking , " Who is Justin Bieber ? " .
Like I say , ignorance only makes him stronger .
Nevertheless , it 's reasonable for you to wonder who this mop - topped popstrel is , why he is being beamed into your world with increasing frequency , and whether you can just ignore him like you do the Jonas Brothers and the second - tier Disney girls .
Is he going to be the next Justin Timberlake , or a blast - from - the - past pick for the 2015 edition of Dancing With the Stars ?
Put briefly , Justin 's story is this : he is Canadian , comes from good Christian stock , and he's the first genuine YouTube sensation to cross over into mainstream pop stardom .
( Unless you think Susan Boyle is a popstar , in which case , how old are you ? )
It all started with his mother posting his musical performances on the site , then they went viral .
Next Usher beat out Justin Timberlake in the race to sign him , and now the 16 - year - old Biebster has a platinum album , while a world tour is on the horizon .
As is puberty , one assumes , though Justin 's ear - melting reliance on Autotune currently renders any early signs undetectable .
Now , there may yet be those among you still fighting surrender to Bieber 's dominance , which is expected to go full spectrum by June .
If you fit that profile , chances are you 're a recovering stalker , who 's maybe got Hanson 's milk teeth in your box of special treasures , and who 's thinking , " I swore I 'd never let myself get hurt like that again . "
Also , you pay taxes , can drink legally , and no longer have to ask the permission of the bill payer if you wish to indulge in reality TV suffrage .
In which case , let me sell you on the legal history angle .
This week , Justin 's manager , Scott Braun , surrendered to police for failing to warn the star 's fans about overcrowding at a shopping mall CD signing he staged in Willston Park , New York , last November , in which five people were hospitalised .
State police say the minute it became clear the gig was overcrowding , they asked Braun to tweet fans telling them the gig was cancelled .
But he refused , even changing Justin 's account password so " he could control the event " , and the abort mission instructions only appeared on the site two hours later .
" By refusing to send out the cancellation Tweet and preventing others from doing so , he blatantly ignored police directives , " rages the DA – and Scott now faces up to a year in jail if convicted .
Do you see , oldies ?
Human civilisation has just notched up the first case of a man being arrested for failure to tweet .
This is Justin 's world now – you 're just living in it .

In the following article , i explain the principles of operation of a brushed DC motor with permanent magnets .
Also i show how a DC motor ( with permanent magnets ) is made and what is inside in such a motor .
If you are interested in brushless DC motors , then better go to the page about how brushless DC motors work .
The Ampere 's rule ( the right - hand screw rule )
It is Frenchman Andre- Marie Ampere ( 1775 - 1836 ) , a mathematician and physicist , who discovered what happens to a wire winded in a coil when current flows within .
The current will generate a magnetic field around the coil , as shown in the following drawing :
The " right - hand screw rule "
Using your right hand , you can find out the direction of the magnetic lines as well as the North pole orientation .
Close your fist and hold your thumb upwards , like thumbs - up .
If you had the coil inside your hand and your fingers ( except the thumb ) was showing the direction of the current , then the thumb shows the direction of the magnetic lines as well as the orientation of the North pole .
This is called " the right - hand screw rule " .
The basic DC motor has actually two windings and two permanent magnets .
The coils are powered from the commutator and the brushes .
We will see these two later on .
For now , you only need to know that during a full cycle of the rotor , the current that runs through each winding change direction once .
Thus , each electromagnet will change its magnetic polarity .
Moreover , the windings of the two magnets are winded in reversed direction .
Thus , when one electromagnet is North , the other is South and vice versa .
Look at the following drawing of the basic DC motor :
The following animation indicates how the two electromagnets changes magnetic polarity during a full rotation :
I have with RED color the North pole and with BLUE the South pole .
If you watch this animation , you will see that there is one moment that both electromagnets are turned off .
This is the time that the basic DC motor provides no torque at all .
In all other occasions , the magnets are either PULLED from the opposite pole or PUSHED from the same pole and therefore the mechanical power is generated .
The commutator and the brushes of a DC motor
This kind of DC motor is called " Brushed DC motor " .
Why ?
Because it uses brushes ...
The brushes are the way that the motor provides the coils with power , and the geometrical characteristics and position of the brushes ( and the commutator of course ) will be responsible for changing the magnetic field of the two electromagnets according to the position of the rotor .
So , how this is done ?
The brushes are two metallic pieces that act like springs .
On one side , they have a piece of conductive material , usually made of carbon to stand against friction .
On the other side , they have the pin that the power supply is applied to the motor .
The brushes are pushed ( by the spring action of the metallic part ) against the commutator .
The commutator is a metallic ring , also conductive and able to stand friction , that is divided in two parts .
The following drawing explains how these parts are :
The commutator is fixed on the shaft of the motor .
Each semi-ring has one pole of each coil .
Giving thus power to both half - rings , is like giving power to the coils .
But while the shaft of the motor rotates , the commutator rotates as well .
This causes the poles of the power supply provided to the coils to change .
This change of the electric poles , has an affect on the magnetic poles as well .
The current direction is changed and - due to the rule of the right - hand screw - the poles of the electromagnets will also change .
The following two animations indicates this procedure .
The left one shows the brushes and the commutator from above , while the right one shows how the electric and magnetic polarity is changed .
Notice how each part of the commutator changes polarity as it rotates .
This is the basic operation of the DC motor .
Notice also , that there is one moment that the commutator is short - circuited .
During this time , the motor produces no power at all , and also the short - circuit can cause several damages due to over current .
This of course does not happen in real life .
Later on , i will explain how this is avoided .
Now , its worth to see this video that explains exactly how the DC motor is made :
Real life is different
This is a schematic drawing of the coil arrangement of a real motor .
Indeed it is .
Nevertheless , the theory of operation is absolutely the same as above .
What changes is the number of coils .
Instead of 2 , there are actually 3 coils that takes part .
These 3 coils will solve the following 3 problems :
First of all , there is no more this position that the commutators are short - circuited , and the motor will provide all the time torque , without the problems from over - current .
Also , while in operation , always two or three coils will be active and interact with the permanent magnets .
And because the coils have 120o angle between them , the torque provided by the motor is much more smooth and never falls to 0 .
Finally , if the motor had 2 coils and it was stopped in this position where the commutator is short - circuited , it would be impossible to start it again .
Of course , the 3 coils require now a different construction of the commutator .
It is composed by 3 pieces instead of two , and the gaps are in circular pastern with 120o angle .
The brushes are again two .
The following animation shows how the real motor with the 3 coils works :
The way that the armature changes magnetic polarity is not that easy to understand as in the simple motor with 2 electromagnets .
To understand the operation , you need to know first of all how the electromagnets are internally connected .
The following image indicates this connection :
All electromagnets are winded with the same direction of rotation .
Now , we have to distinguish two different situations as the motor rotates ,
The first situation , is when a brush is between two collectors .
At this moment , all collectors are having power .
During this time , one coil will have the same polarity between its poles , thus , this coil will NOT produce a magnetic a field as no current flows within .
The other situation is when one commutator piece has no power .
This happens most of the time during the rotation of the motor .
This commutator piece will act as a bridge for the two coils , that have one wire connected on it .
Thus , these two coils will be considered as connected in series !
And because their windings - as said before - have the same direction , they will both produce a magnetic field of the same magnetic polarity .
The following two images indicates these two situations .
The piece of commutator that is black has no power .
It acts like a bridge for coils 1 and 2 .
These coils are connected in series and they generate the same magnetic polarity .
All commutators have power .
This time , coil 2 has both its ends to the same electric polarity - NEGATIVE .
Thus , coil 2 will produce no magnetic field at all .
Finally , let 's see a real motor hos it is made !
I always like tearing things apart and see how they work !
* New York AG Cuomo alleges fraud in civil suit
* SEC proposes $ 150 million settlement of two lawsuits
* Defendants reject charges
* Bank of America falls 5 percent ; other banks also down ( Adds comment , closing prices )
By Jonathan Stempel and Joe Rauch
NEW YORK / ORLANDO , Fla. , Feb 4 ( Reuters ) - New York 's attorney general charged Bank of America Corp BAC.N , former Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis and former Chief Financial Officer Joe Price with fraud for allegedly misleading shareholders about the acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission separately said Bank of America agreed to pay a $ 150 million civil fine and bolster disclosure and governance practices to settle its two lawsuits alleging poor disclosure of Merrill ’s losses and $ 3.6 billion of bonus payouts .
That accord requires court approval .
Thursday ’s civil lawsuit by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo may distract new Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan from efforts to improve performance at the largest U.S. bank .
He replaced Lewis , who retired under pressure at the end of 2009 after four decades at the bank .
Lewis , 62 , joins Countrywide Financial Corp ’s Angelo Mozilo among major U.S. financial services chief executives to face civil regulatory fraud charges over conduct since a global credit crisis began in the middle of 2007 .
Invoking a powerful state law used to combat securities fraud , Cuomo accused Bank of America , Lewis and Price of intentionally failing to disclose massive losses at Merrill prior to a Dec. 5 , 2008 shareholder vote on the merger .
Cuomo also alleged that the defendants later misled the federal government in arguing that a “ surprise ” increase in Merrill ’s losses would allow Bank of America to back out of the merger if it did not get massive taxpayer help .
His lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and other remedies .
Merrill lost $ 15.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 , but Cuomo said just $ 1.4 billion surfaced between Dec. 5 and when Bank of America began to raise alarm bells in Washington .
“ The behavior is just egregious and reprehensible , ” Cuomo said on a conference call with reporters .
Bank of America took $ 20 billion of bailout money from the federal government ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program to help absorb Merrill .
It has since repaid that sum .
“ Change is so obviously needed at Bank of America , ” said Neil Barofsky , the TARP special inspector general , on the conference call .
Price remains at the bank , and was last month named head of consumer , small business and card banking .
David Markowitz , who heads Cuomo ’s investor protection bureau , said Moynihan is not under investigation .
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^
See also Breakingviews “ NY goes hard on BofA ” [ ID :nN04105675 ] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^
“ SERIOUS BLOW ”
Cuomo filed the charges under the Martin Act , a New York law giving him extraordinary power in securities litigation and fighting financial fraud .
The law dates from 1921 , more than a decade before the SEC was created .
Bob Stickler , a Bank of America spokesman , called Cuomo ’s charges “ regrettable ” and without merit .
“ The evidence demonstrates that Bank of America and its executives , including Ken Lewis and Joe Price , at all times acted in good faith and consistent with their legal and fiduciary obligations , ” he said .
Lewis ’ lawyer Mary Jo White , a former U.S. Attorney in New York and now a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP , called the decision to sue “ badly misguided , ” saying : “ There is not a shred of objective evidence to support the allegations . ”
William Jeffress , a partner at Baker Botts LLP who represents Price , said his client also denies Cuomo ’s charges , and called “ utterly false ” the charge that Price deliberately encouraged the withholding of information from shareholders .
“ This is a serious blow for the bank , ” said Tony Plath , a finance professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte .
“ This does n’t look like it ’s going to go away any time soon . ”
It is unclear how Cuomo ’s lawsuit might affect Price ’s consumer banking responsibilities .
Like many rivals , the bank faces elevated credit losses in a weak economy , though the sums it has set aside for bad loans have begun to decline .
“ Is Price now going to spend his time preparing his defense , instead of getting retail straightened out ? ” said Nancy Bush , a principal at NAB Research LLC .
Bank of America shares closed down 5 percent at $ 14.75 on the New York Stock Exchange .
The KBW Bank Index .
BKX of big lenders fell 4.3 percent .
Bank of America traded at $ 33.74 before the Merrill merger was announced .
“ HUBRIS ” ALLEGED
Cuomo , the SEC and Congress have long attacked the handling of the Merrill merger , which was put together over a weekend and announced on Sept. 15 , 2008 , the same morning that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ .
PK went bankrupt .
“ Throughout this episode , the conduct of Bank of America , through its top management , was motivated by self - interest , greed , hubris , and a palpable sense that the normal rules of fair play did not apply to them , ” Cuomo ’s complaint said .
“ Management thought of itself as too big to play by the rules and , just as disturbingly , too big to tell the truth , ” it added .
On the conference call , Markowitz said Moynihan had no role in disclosure - related discussions before the shareholder vote .
He also said Moynihan “ has been candid ” about his role after becoming the bank ’s general counsel in mid-December 2008 .
The SEC settlement directs the $ 150 million penalty to a fund for the bank ’s shareholders .
It also calls for several governance and disclosure changes over a three - year period .
These changes include giving shareholders a voice on executive pay , taking extra steps to insure the independence of directors on its compensation committee , and posting incentive pay practices in a prominent place on its website .
The settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff , which is not a sure thing .
In September , he rejected a $ 33 million SEC settlement with the bank over the lack of bonus disclosures , in part because it did not hold any individual bank executives , bank directors or outside lawyers responsible for failures .
“ How does taking more money out of Bank of America enable Rakoff to sleep better at night when he was upset before that the shareholders would have to pay ? ” said James Cox , a securities law professor at Duke University .
Cuomo maintained that “ the benefit of a settlement is you have an immediate action , you can implement immediate reforms , ” while his simultaneous lawsuit can “ bring people to justice . ”
Rakoff is scheduled to hold a hearing on SEC litigation against the bank on Monday afternoon .
The New York case is New York v. Bank of America Corp et al , New York State Supreme Court , New York County .
The SEC cases are SEC v. Bank of America Corp , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York , Nos , 09-06829 and 10-00215 .

When A123Systems saw its shares jump more than 50 percent in a successful Nasdaq debut back in September , some industry insiders expected it would be the first of a bevy of big energy - storage headlines .
Instead , energy storage seems to have fallen out of the limelight , getting nothing near as much hype as Bloom Energy , a fuel - cell company focused on electricity generation instead of energy storage , generated when it launched last month .
But a series of recent small announcements suggest that energy - storage technologies are quietly making progress toward commercialization nonetheless .
“ There seems to be a lot more buzz in the last few months , and what ’s interesting is it ’s not all on the automotive side , ” said Sara Bradford , a principal consultant for global research firm Frost & Sullivan .
While automobiles remain a key area for new energy - storage technologies , she ’s seeing a “ spillover effect ” as research and investment spreads into other areas , including grid applications for utilities and nonautomotive transportation .
Some examples ?
In February , Valence Technology signed a $ 45 million deal to supply its lithium - ion battery systems for a new line of hybrid- electric yachts , sailboats and motorboats from Beneteau Group .
And International Battery , another lithium - ion rechargeable battery manufacturer , announced it was selected to supply battery systems for an American Electric Power smart - grid demonstration project in Ohio .
The community energy storage part of the project , which is being developed by S&C Electric Company , is intended help stabilize the grid and provide backup power , potentially enabling plug - in electric vehicles and a higher percentage of intermittent renewable - energy sources , such as solar and wind power .
In January , battery maker GS Battery teamed up with screen - printed solar - cell manufacturer Suniva to develop solar - power systems with batteries that can store the energy for times of peak demand .
And Ice Energy — which reduces peak electricity demand from air conditioners in the middle of the day by making ice at night , when demand is low and surplus electricity is available , and using it to help cool air conditioning refrigerant when temperatures are high — signed a deal to sell its devices to the 11 municipal utilities represented by the Southern California Public Power Authority .
While many of the announcements have represented only small steps — such as pilot projects or an entrance into niche markets — they show that a number of technologies are on the right track , and some are ready to go , she said .
“ Exciting things are happening that set the stage to really make [ commercialization ] happen short - term , ” Bradford said .
“ These announcements are certainly steps in the right direction to get these technologies ready for electric vehicles and the grid . ”
Electric vehicles and grid storage represent huge potential markets for new energy - storage technologies .
As startups Tesla Motors and Fisker Automotive work to advance electric sports cars , companies such as General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. , and Volkswagen are rushing to come out with plug - in hybrids .
And as utilities work to meet state renewable - energy goals and add more solar and wind power to their portfolios , energy storage to help smooth out the intermittent power from those sources is becoming ever more critical .
Roadblocks Ahead
Of course , energy storage technologies have some big obstacles to overcome before they ’ll be commercially viable for those applications , Bradford said .
First of all , they ’re too expensive , and companies are working to cut costs .
Car battery systems also need high power density , as automakers want batteries to deliver a long electric range with as little size and weight as possible , and — given the high density — technology that ensures they that wo n’t catch fire .
Safety also is a big issue for backup power batteries , especially those intended for homes , Bradford said .
And while both electric vehicle and clean - energy markets have been spurred by government initiatives and policies , both the auto industry and the energy industry are notoriously slow - moving .
In general , companies with multiple applications will be more likely to have the foundation they need to survive the wait to the electric vehicle and grid markets , Bradford said .
“ Obviously , the Holy Grail is to be in the automotive or grid market for this technology , but the reality is there needs to be niche applications to build that momentum to those big fish , ” she said .
Why are we seeing all this activity now ?
For one thing , Bradford thinks we may be seeing a delayed effect from the A123 IPO .
“ It did n’t happen right away — 2009 was a rocky year for the industry , with some setbacks in orders coming in and the economic downturn — but now I ’m seeing some new interest , ” she said .
“ Certainly I feel from the research that we ’ve seen and the market movement that this [ sector ] may emerge more quickly than others when the economy recovers . ”
The stimulus package also played a big role in raising interest in energy - storage technology , setting aside $ 2 billion in advanced battery manufacturing grants and up to $ 25 billion in loans for advanced vehicles , including related energy - storage technologies .
Last year , Bradford said that the U.S. battery industry was “ humming with revived confidence ” as a result of the stimulus package .
Even though the loan guarantees have rolled out more slowly than expected , the government funding has clearly had an effect .
For example , when A123 won a $ 249 million manufacturing grant from the U.S. Department of Energy a month before its initial public offering last year , it “ was pretty clear [ the grant ] helped get investors excited about the company , ” said Sheeraz Haji , president of the Cleantech Group .
“ Private capital is following public capital . ”
Venture - capital investment in energy storage grew 23 percent globally in 2009 to $ 472 million , according to the group .
With all the government and venture - capital attention , you can expect to see more energy - storage announcements coming soon .
It remains to be seen whether the announcements will result in real products that can help spur electric vehicles and more renewable energy on the grid , but Bradford said that several companies are now finishing up their evaluation period — meaning that it should soon become clear whether their technologies are ready to address these markets or not .
One good sign is that a few companies are starting to see revenues , she said , pointing to Valence ’s commercial deal .
Bradford expects to see more energy - storage technologies to hit the market in the next 12 to 18 months .

Headstones for Dummies , the New York Edition September 29 , 2006 by Sarah Pickman
Exploring three of Manhattan 's colonial cemeteries
In 1967 , historical archaeologists James Deetz and Edwin Dethlefsen published a seminal study of colonial New England headstones entitled Death 's Head , Cherub , Urn and Willow , after the three most prevalent motifs found on seventeenth - and eighteenth - century grave markers in the New England colonies .
In studying the popular forms of grave decoration from this place and time , Deetz and Dethlefsen connected the early dominance of the death 's head skull on headstones with the harsh beliefs of Puritanism and its emphasis on mortality .
The fall in popularity of the death 's head and the subsequent prevalence of the cherub was a reflection of the Great Awakening and the belief in the immortality of the soul : " Cherubs reflect a stress on resurrection , while death 's heads emphasize the mortality of man . "
Finally , the popularity of the urn and willow in the very late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was prompted by the Greek Revival .
This dramatic headstone at Trinity Church dates to 1819 .
( Sarah Pickman )
Nearly 20 years later , Sherene Baugher and Frederick Winter , writing in ARCHAEOLOGY ( " Early American Gravestones , " September / October 1983 ) examined three early cemeteries in New York - - a place that was arguably more ethnically and religiously diverse during the colonial period -- to see if the pattern of the three motifs from Deetz and Dethlefsen 's study held true for New York headstones , or if differences were noticeable based on the deceased 's religion , ethnicity , sex , or age .
After studying both English and Dutch headstones in two Anglican -- including Trinity Church in Manhattan -- and one non-sectarian cemetery , they found no significant difference in headstone decoration across ethnic or religious lines .
Now , ARCHAEOLOGY again visits the early cemeteries of New York City , to give you an in - depth look at some of the grave decorations you 'll find as you stop at the burial grounds of Shearith Israel congregation , Trinity Church , and St. Paul 's Church on your tour .
While white marble , a popular medium for headstones in the nineteenth century , erodes rather easily , the sedimentary brown sandstone used for most colonial headstones in New York weathers the elements well , leaving many inscriptions and designs visible to this day .
Shearith Israel cemetery is the earliest surviving cemetery of New York 's first Jewish congregation .
This cemetery was in use from 1682 until 1828 .
Though it is locked to outside visitors , a glance through the bars surrounding the small patch of land will reveal some interesting details of the headstones , which mark some of colonial America 's earliest non-Christian burials .
The earliest headstones in the cemetery are of the three - lobed shape that also dominated in Christian burials at the time , a shape that resembled a the headboard of a bed and was thus symbolic of man 's final sleep .
The death 's head and cherub images are missing from the Shearith Israel headstones ; in fact , images in general are largely absent .
One remarkable exception , though , is a pair of hands on the tympanum ( central lobe ) of Josiah Ellis ' eighteenth - century headstone ; hands turned slightly toward each other , palms outward ( see image ) .
This image probably represents the prayer gesture of the Kohanim , the caste of priests in ancient Israel who were descendants of Aaron , Moses ' brother .
Even today , Jews believed to be descendants of the Kohanim have an elite status within more conservative branches of Judaism , and they often elect to have this ancient symbol engraved on their headstones .
Josiah Ellis must have chosen this image to remind those who saw his headstone of his great ancestry .
The earliest brown stone markers are inscribed in Hebrew or Hebrew and English ; inscriptions made only in English appear when marble is used for the headstones , which dates them to the nineteenth century .
Trinity Church was officially chartered in 1697 , but the cemetery had already been in use for at least 16 years by then .
Here , among the colonial headstones , the most common are stones that bear only inscriptions .
Death 's heads and cherubs are the most popular images , with urn and willow designs appearing on later -- the first dates to 1816 -- and fewer stones .
Particularly striking is the wide variety of cherubs that can be seen at Trinity : some are simple and ominous , bearing more resemblance to a death 's head skull than a benevolent angel .
Others are more intricate and appear kinder , if still somber .
Baugher and Winter found that there was no apparent correlation between the motif used and the sex or age of the deceased .
Religious orientation , in connection to headstones , is difficult to determine at Trinity ; though the church has always been Episcopalian , in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it permitted the burial of dead from a local Lutheran church , as well as any unaffiliated wards of the city .
The only pattern appears to be chronological ; as in New England , the death 's head 's prevalence waned in the eighteenth century and was replaced by the cherub , with both forms equally popular in the 1740s .
Some other decorations from the time include Masonic symbols ( see image ) and an unusual triad of cannons on the grave of a carpenter ( see image ) .
Founded as a provincial branch church of Trinity parish in 1766 , St. Paul 's Church is home to a cemetery with hundreds of colonial and early nineteenth century headstones .
At St. Paul's , cherubs reign as the most popular form of colonial decoration , though there are numerous stones free of images as well .
Death 's heads appear infrequently .
Here , the first urn and willow design appears on a late eighteenth - century marker , pre-dating stones with similar designs at Trinity by more than 20 years .
With uncharacteristic bluntness , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke warned Congress on Wednesday that the United States could soon face a debt crisis like the one in Greece , and declared that the central bank will not help legislators by printing money to pay for the ballooning federal debt .
Recent events in Europe , where Greece and other nations with large , unsustainable deficits like the United States are having increasing trouble selling their debt to investors , show that the U.S. is vulnerable to a sudden reversal of fortunes that would force taxpayers to pay higher interest rates on the debt , Mr. Bernanke said .
“ It ’s not something that is 10 years away .
It affects the markets currently , ” he told the House Financial Services Committee .
“ It is possible that bond markets will become worried about the sustainability [ of yearly deficits over $ 1 trillion ] , and we may find ourselves facing higher interest rates even today . ”
It was some of the toughest rhetoric to date about the nation ’s fiscal and budgetary woes from the Fed chief , who faces a second round of questioning Thursday before a Senate panel .
RELATED STORY : Fed to look at high - risk contracts on Greek debt
Mr. Bernanke for the first time addressed concerns that the impasse in Congress over tough spending cuts and tax increases needed to bring down deficits will eventually force the Fed to accommodate deficits by printing money and buying Treasury bonds — effectively financing the deficit on behalf of Congress and spurring inflation in the process .
Some economists at the International Monetary Fund and elsewhere have advocated this approach , suggesting running moderate inflation rates of 4 percent to 6 percent as a partial solution to the U.S. debt problem .
But the move runs the risk of damaging the dollar ’s reputation and spawning much higher inflation that would be debilitating to the U.S. economy and living standards .
Rep. Brad Sherman , California Democrat , asked Mr. Bernanke directly whether the Fed would consider such a strategy , especially since IMF officials endorsed it .
“ We ’re not going to monetize the debt , ” Mr. Bernanke declared flatly , stressing that Congress needs to start making plans to bring down the deficit to avoid such a dangerous dilemma for the Fed .
“ It is very , very important for Congress and administration to come to some kind of program , some kind of plan that will credibly show how the United States government is going to bring itself back to a sustainable position . ”
Separately , Mr. Bernanke ’s predecessor , Alan Greenspan , told Bloomberg News that “ fiscal affairs are threatening the outlook ” for recovery from recession as Congress and the White House have been unable for years to make tough decisions to raise taxes or cut spending .
He said he is so concerned about a sudden sharp increase in interest rates that every day he checks the interest rate on 10 - year Treasury notes and 30 - year Treasury bonds , calling them the “ critical Achilles ’ heel ” of the economy .
Despite his gloomy testimony , Mr. Bernanke dismissed concerns that the United States will lose its gold - plated AAA credit rating any time soon .
Moody ’s Investors Service recently said that the U.S. rating would come “ under pressure ” at some point if Congress does not rein in the budget deficit .
The Fed chairman said repeatedly that he understands how difficult it will be for Congress to tame deficits by curbing spending in popular programs like Social Security , Medicare and defense , while also considering tax hikes .
But he said there would be an immediate payoff : lower interest rates .
“ It would be very helpful , even to the current recovery , to markets ’ confidence , if there were a sustainable , credible plan for a fiscal exit , ” he said .
A plan that eases market worries by laying out how Congress will address the long - term insolvency of Social Security , Medicare and other entitlement programs also would give Congress more room to take the actions needed today to address the jobs crisis , Mr. Bernanke added .
“ There could be a bonus there , ” he said .
“ To the extent that we can achieve credible plans to reduce medium - to long - term deficits , we ’ll actually have more flexibility in the short term if we want to take other kinds of actions . ”
Separately , the debate continued over whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two mortgage financing giants , should be included in the federal budget books now that the Obama administration has taken the limits off aid the Treasury Department is prepared to give the companies to keep them solvent .
Republicans , including Rep. Spencer Bachus of Alabama , the top Republican on the banking committee , have argued that the government is now effectively guaranteeing Fannie and Freddie ’s nearly $ 5 trillion of mortgage - backed securities and other debt , so their revenues and liabilities should be included in the federal budget as obligations of the government .
Taking this step would greatly bloat the federal balance sheet .
Mr. Bachus said he worries that keeping Fannie and Freddie ’s status off the federal books is “ the same sort of financial shell game that has brought governments like Greece to a crisis point . ”
But Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner , who also testified on Capitol Hill on Wednesday , said the administration opposes including the quasi - government entities in the budget , although it lifted the limits on aid to Fannie and Freddie with the intent of assuring financial markets that the U.S. government stands behind their obligations .
“ We do not think it is necessary to consolidate the full obligations of Fannie and Freddie onto the nation ’s budget .
But we do think it ’s very important … that we make it clear to investors around the world that we will make sure that we will take the actions necessary ” to keep the two entities stable , he told the House Budget Committee .

( CNN ) --
A sex tape allegedly showing former Sen. John Edwards survived a fire that torched a North Carolina courthouse on Thursday .
Actually , the tape that was the subject of a February court hearing at the historic Chatham County Courthouse was not at the courthouse during the blaze , city officials said .
The tape , said to show Edwards and his former mistress Rielle Hunter , had been moved to another facility , said Debora Henzey , community relations director for Chatham County .
Seven fire departments responded to the blaze at the courthouse in downtown Pittsboro about 4:45 p.m. Thursday .
It took firefighters hours to quell the blaze , which severely damaged the courthouse .
In February , the courthouse was the scene of the legal battle over the sex tape , with Hunter suing for its return .
At the hearing , Judge Abraham Penn Jones found former Edwards aide Andrew Young and his wife , Cheri , in civil contempt of court and ordered them to hand over the tape to the court .
In court documents , the Youngs had said that the video showed " Senator Edwards engaged in sexual activities with a woman who , from all indications , is not his wife and who the Youngs believe to be Ms. Hunter , based upon her appearance . "
In January , Edwards admitted that he had fathered a child with Hunter , a videographer who worked on his 2008 presidential campaign .
Edwards had publicly denied paternity for more than a year .
About a week after his admission , he confirmed reports that he had legally separated from his wife , Elizabeth .
Those announcements came just before Andrew Young released an embarrassing book about the Edwardses and his campaign .
CNN 's Jessica Jordan contributed to this report .
Nokia says it will replace Symbian with its Maemo Linux by 2012 .
All high - end N series multimedia devices will be running the Linux OS by then .
Rubbing salt in the wounds of longtime Epoc developers , it disclosed the news to a meetup of Maemo enthusiasts – Ben Smith reports at The Really Mobile Project blog .
X series and E series devices will continue to run Symbian OS – at least for the time being .
It is n’t such a surprise .
At NokiaWorld in September , Nokia confirmed in public and in private that Maemo was the bedrock for future high - end devices , with Symbian downgraded to a “ workhorse ” smartphone OS for the midrange .
Only a fortnight earlier , Nokia had strenuously denied the strategy .
So much for honest community relations .
So , after billions of dollars of investment over 11 years , how can Nokia now justify changing horses ?
Especially since Symbian still offers the best kernel and middleware stack for mobiles , with the meanest power management , and years of debugging .
It 's Nokia ’s inept record of developing UIs and services ( think anything with the word “ Ovi ” near it ) that 's to blame , and also its negligence in failing to give Symbian a modern and attractive development environment ( it bought Trolltech ’s QT five years too late ) .
Thanks to lousy software development , it had boxed itself into a corner .
Only four years ago , Nokia had three in - house user interfaces for Symbian which - if it had sustained the investment - would cover everything from tablets to instant - on netbooks ( where iPhone OS and Android OS are today ) .
It ’s a case of neglecting to feed the dog , then saying it ca n’t afford the vet ’s bill . ®
Is it possible to win the World Cup with a flawed manager ?
In fairness to France , they made a very decent attempt in 2006 .
But for Zinedine Zidane 's extraordinary bull - charge during the final against Italy , things might have ended up very differently for Raymond Domenech .
At the end of that emotive night in Berlin , the French manager stood alone on the pitch and watched the triumphant Italians cavorting with the trophy .
The rest of the French squad had drifted away but he could not take his eyes away from the scene of World Cup nirvana .
He appeared transfixed .
Against most reasonable logic , Domenech is still at the helm to have another go in South Africa .
The past four seasons have seen his team , and his stock , decline .
During this week 's friendly against Spain , the message from the stands to the dugout was stark : " Domenech démission ! " Domenech quit !
Not exactly the perfect gee - up in what was their last match at Stade de France before the World Cup .
A more general expression of local optimism was the sound of ironic " olés " when their opponents sashayed and swept the ball around sweetly .
" There 's nothing to worry about , " tutted Domenech later , to a room full of worried journalists .
Given the bizarre nature of their qualification , aided as it was by the Thierry Henry handball against Ireland , there would be a dripping irony were France to stick it up to the critics and have a fine World Cup .
The current champions , Italy , arrived at the last tournament caught in the maelstrom of the corruption scandal that engulfed Serie A .
They used all the brickbats , all the accusations , all the distaste , to make them stronger , and in the end worthy victors .
But there are several good reasons why France , despite their pedigree , look ill - equipped to offer a reprise of Italy 's redemption story .
The squad has weaknesses , notably at centre - half ( Julien Escudé , Jean Alain Boumsong , say no more ) .
Against a team as comfortable and confident as Spain there was also trouble up front , where one observer in Paris described the Henry - Nicolas Anelka - Franck Ribéry axis as " three lost divas " .
They also do n't have a Zidane , and do have a Domenech who becomes even more intransigent the longer he stays in the job .
An inspirer , a guide , a leader , a Marcello Lippi , he is not .
On the pitch , it was not a happy evening for France against a Spanish team who looked light years ahead .
Henry said they were " untouchable – from a different planet " .
The Barcelona forward contributed to this directly , giving the ball away needlessly to enable David Villa to score on the break .
France 's captain was booed .
And the worst thing about it ?
The jeers had nothing to do with a handball .
Nothing to do with gadding about with a team - mate 's ex-girlfriend .
It was just about playing like a drain .
Without much regular football for his club he feels like he has concrete in his boots , confessing he had " absolutely no pace " .
France have now overtaken Argentina in the floundering favourites stakes .
Diego Maradona 's team , after a dismal qualification campaign , pulled themselves together to convincingly beat Germany in Munich .
Are things beginning to take shape ?
Like France , they have struggled to make a whole from the sum of their parts under idiosyncratic management .
But Maradona was bullish after a matchwinner from Gonzalo Higuaín – a player he originally shunned – earned a midweek win he reckoned required the character of a World Cup quarter - final .
" Maybe the press in Argentina wo n't like it , but we are going to play a very good World Cup in South Africa , " he enthused .
" What we showed is that we have a team who can become world champions for the first time after 24 years .
We 've said that we 're here and we 're ready to put up a fight .
This result was important because it showed the Argentine public that we have a great team .
We got it wrong against Brazil , Ecuador and in La Paz [ their defeats in qualification ] , but we 've always had the players . "
Maradona is not wrong about having the players .
This result was achieved without Diego Milito and Carlos Tevez , among the most productive strikers in Serie A and the Premier League , left out of the starting line - up .
There is still considerable room for polishing the squad , and the fireball coach still has to prove he can eke the best out of Lionel Messi , among other things .
But it is hard to escape the feeling that the biggest risk to Maradona 's positive World Cup predictions is himself .
As well as the question of whether the team can evolve , is the issue of whether they can live with such a combustible and unpredictable manager while shut away in their camp for a month or more .
France managed to nearly win the World Cup last time because a group of the senior players , led by Zidane , took control of the situation .
Whether any of Argentina 's players are able to rein in the madness of Maradona remains to be seen .
But it will be fun watching .

Making online social games 2007 - 2009
by Justin Hall
Between 2007 and 2009 GameLayers made a multiplayer game across all the content of the internet .
I was the CEO of GameLayers and one of three co-founders .
Here I 'll share lessons and data from this online social game startup .
This Story of GameLayers covers prototyping , fund raising , company building , strategic shifting , winding down and moving on .
You can read it for free , because sharing knowledge is fun .
You can also encourage me to take more time to write stuff like this if you purchase " A Story of GameLayers " for the Kindle .

Introduction
New communications technologies create new opportunities for people to work , play and live together .
In the late 20th and early 21st century , humans created businesses on top of rapidly evolving communications networks .
This is the story of an internet startup - starting an entertainment software company to evolve this new medium for human expression .
Starting in 1994 , I worked for a series of internet startups based in San Francisco .
Hot Wired , electric minds , Gamers.com - each of them filled an empty space in our internet and offered the public free access .
Each of them received far too few dollars in return to continue .
Then in 2007 I had the chance to establish and run an internet startup as CEO .
At my company GameLayers we worked to transform web surfing into a giant ongoing social game .
It was a bold adventure , and by the end of 2009 GameLayers too had failed as a company .
The games we made failed to find sustainable audiences .
No one works for GameLayers now or plays GameLayers games .
You are holding a story of GameLayers .
I am telling this story because it helps me feel that GameLayers was a worthwhile experience .
This is the story of sharing an idea .
Finding money and comrades to transform that idea into a business .
Working to make that business survive .
Then grieving and learning when the business fails .
Along the way I had to do many things I 'd never done before , things I have recounted here .
I had to hire people , fire people , convince people to give me money and convince myself I was qualified to honor 120,000 users , nine GameLayerers , four investors and my marriage partner co-creating an usual game .
This GameLayers story is supported by a wide range of documents .
Herein you 'll find links to pitch decks , the story we told investors to raise money .
You 'll find a link to the " term sheet " from our investors listing the conditions for 1.5 million investment dollars .
You 'll find the board meeting slideshows accounting for our progress towards our goals .
There 's even more supporting material linked throughough : I erred on the side of too much information .
You can decide how many of these linked documents you care for ; hopefully these other documents are viewable on the device you 're using to view this document .
My goal is to help someone with an idea see how they might possibly start a business .
Maybe you do n't expect to run your own company ( I did n't either ) .
Maybe you 're just curious about the " internet startup " hoopla , or you dream of inventing your online game idea some day .
I hope this story of GameLayers might help you better understand what can happen when people have a chance to turn an idea into a company .
2006 Grad School Project
In 2006 , I was an MFA graduate student at the University of Southern California Film School Interactive Media Division .
A reformed journalist , I attended grad school to learn to make the kinds of software I 'd only written about before .
I was watching people play World of Warcraft and I wanted to have that kind of immersive persistent social travels through dataspace .
WoW looked like fun !
But I could n't focus on one MMO - too much time investment required .
How about an MMO ( massively - multiplayer online game ) for life on the web ?
I was living with M ( name and likeness redacted by request ) , a creative writing major at USC .
M and I teased out ideas for role - playing game mapped to web surfing .
So you can earn points for doing what you 're already doing !
Mentored by a number of agreeable engineers , I rigged up a single player prototype , using a Firefox extension that saved my web history to a file , then parsing that web traffic with PHP to give myself Dungeons & Dragons - style attributes .
Surfing a lot of Flickr gave me high dexterity but lowered my constitution .
Surfing the Wall Street Journal raised by intelligence but lowered my wisdom .
I hand - coded game values for a few sites .
M made art for each of the attributes based on the paintings of Alphonse Mucha .
Livened up with some visuals this prototype was enough to present at a conference Aula summer 2006 in Helsinki Finland .
Game maven Alice Taylor was in the audience .
She and Matt Locke at the BBC had a mandate to sponsor innovative educational interactive media projects .
The BBC gave us a $ 20 k grant to build a game to teach people web literacy , on the condition we hire a British programmer .
PMOG - the passively multiplayer online game
So now this became PMOG - the Passively Multiplayer Online Game .
From Fall 2006 to spring 2007 we worked : myself Justin
Hall as producer / web monkey , game designer / writer M , and a UK game engineer Duncan Gough whom we found through our friend Matt Webb .
The BBC grant and the confines of Scott Fisher 's Interactive Media Division ( IMD ) at USC provided a fine place to incubate our idea .
We were supported and stimulated and challenged by smart folks with a good deadline and feedback mechanisms driving us towards a playable experience .
IMD Professor Tracy Fullerton helped us run PMOG paper prototype tests ; between the IMD and Alice Taylor we had good oversight to keep us focused on building a coherent experience in a finite amount of time .
My last year there I was able to take a class " Business of Interactive Media " with a long - time game industry idol of mine - Jordan Weisman .
He has started multiple successful game production companies based on new media and new markets .
He shared data from his work with the class , giving me the spreadsheet tools to model the cost of running a business and launching projects .
Now I could begin to imagine how to sustain and grow a new game idea .
We showed PMOG in the IMD May 2007 and we had 1,500 players !
Here 's a brief video where I speak to the reasons for PMOG before the IMD thesis show .
Duncan built a basic Firefox sidebar to host a working web annotation game with character records , user generated play objects across web sites , much of the functionality that we 'd initially envisioned for the game .
It felt like a game , at least a fun web toy , with a chat room filling up with return players .
Here 's some pictures and research documents from that early PMOG era .
As we shared our work online , people suggested we could raise some investment .
We had a new type of game experience , a creative use of the Firefox platform .
Maybe we were building some valuable part of the online entertainment landscape .
Maybe we could be an internet startup !
I had worked for some internet startups in the 1990s ( HotWired , electric minds , Gamers.com ) , but I did n't really have a sense of how an idea turned into a business .
Turns out you can raise money on an idea , and a prototype is even better !
This was mid-2007 .
The web was booming - new services were being funded and taking off .
There was a sense that you could grow an idea into something large and it would make money from our large audience or it would be acquired by Yahoo / Microsoft / Google .
So we began presenting the game idea to venture capitalists in Silicon Valley .
It was amazing to understand that this amateur game production could be seen as an economic vehicle .
First Round of Funding
Joi Ito was our first investor , an angel who agreed to come on if we could find other investors .
Joi was a high velocity digital citizen and investor in a number of innovative fun projects .
I had helped Joi set up his weblog when I lived in Japan in 2002 , so we had some history of working online together .
In 2007 Joi was an active World of Warcraft player : he inspired us to make a game that could involve players as much as WoW involved him .
Having Joi signed on first set us up to find other folks .
Joi introduced us to Richard Wolpert , another angel investor with a history of work with Disney Online , Apple , Real Networks - AAA quality companies .
He pushed us to make the experience more accessible and appealing to a broader audience .
Bryce Roberts at O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures was interested .
OATV was a relatively new seed - stage fund , they were looking for companies that might be disruptive or challenging to existing markets .
We believed we were opening the conventional massively - multiplayer online game experience to broader audiences , and we appreciated OATV 's roots in open source and hacker culture .
Plus Bryce had great internet literacy and a fun punk - rock attitude .
I remember sitting in his beautiful conference room with a view of the San Francisco Bay , and him asking : " how much do you think GameLayers is worth ? " ( theoretically , after investment ) .
I had somehow forgotten to plan that answer , so I winged it : " $ 3 million . "
Bryce replied " how about $ 2 million " and I said without much hesitation " okay . "
So there we raised $ 500 k on a post - money valuation of $ 2 million - $ 50 k from each of the angels and $ 400 k from OATV .
OATV pledged millions more in reserve if we showed promise .
I graduated with my MFA in June 2007 and turned down a well - paying offer from Yahoo Games to architect a meta - game of badges and points across their service .
The deal to fund GameLayers , Inc. closed in July 2007 .
M graduated with her undergraduate english degree in May and joined J.J. Abrams ' production company Bad Robot as a receptionist training to use the 3D printer .
M left that job after a few months to be Chief Creative Officer of GameLayers .
Duncan our play prototyper became our CTO , I was the Producer and CEO - we were now three co-founders making a new online experience !
M and I were living in Culver City , near Los Angeles California .
Mark Jacobsen and Bryce at OATV strongly encouraged us to move the business from Los Angeles to San Francisco , to be near more developer talent and to be near other internet companies for collaboration .
The money did n't actually arrive until September ; one of the first great lessons : securing funds takes longer than any prediction or arrangement .
That month we packed ourselves and our dog Pixley Wigglebottom into a UHaul and drove north to a large cheap loft in East Oakland , near San Francisco where so many other internet startups lived .
Now we were charged with building out our company .
We spent $ 5,000 to buy pmog.com .
We hired up to five people .
During fund - raising I remember hearing that you could estimate the costs of running an internet startup at about $ 10 k per full - time employee per month .
That includes everything - overhead , salary , technology , and it actually works pretty well as a formula .
So we went up to about 6 people , burning about $ 60 k a month , which meant that we had a little less than eight months to prove PMOG could be a viable business and GameLayers could be a viable company .
In reality we spent the money slower than we predicted .
It was harder to hire people than we expected .
We saved money by working out of our home .
We recruited folks we knew ; our first employee web designer Cap Watkins was M's friend from USC ; he slept in our East Oakland loft with us and our dog until he found his own place .
Duncan remembers : " when we secured funding from OATV and had a conference call with [ an ] extension - building company where we almost gave up a large chunk of the company in order to have them build our extension . "
It seemed like a fast way to get our game running , but we realized we would n't be able to iterate our own product if someone else built it .
So we decided to hire up a team instead .
As Duncan put it , that " ... was a real challenge , and a test of our self confidence . "
One of our first advisors was Ben Cerveny , a well - connected digital nomad who had worked between the web and gaming for years .
Ben helped us find a playful contract artist / programmer Mark " heavysixer " Daggett in Kansas , we reworked our basic sidebar version of PMOG to have a more integrated HUD and a gourmet Steampunk look .
We chose Steampunk because we felt like the genre was on the rise , and it was appealing to internet early adopters .
We thought Steampunk would also help to distinguish us in the broader games marketplace - stylish playful nerdery .
Beta Launch and Roadshow
We launched PMOG in closed beta in February 2008 - people could play , but only with an invitation .
This allowed us to gradually grow the game , to be sure our servers held up and we were n't getting overwhelmed with new customers .
We had a signup form for people to request access ; I would scan the email addresses for the words " venture " or " capital " or " investments " or " partners " or " fund " - this way I found a number of venture capitalists had signed up for the PMOG beta ; I would reach out to each of them to see if we could book a pitch meeting .
February and March were a big roadshow - talking to the press :
We presented " passively multiplayer online gaming " at conferences : Game Developers Conference in San Francisco ( coverage ) , Emerging Technology Conference in San Diego , South by Southwest in Austin .
In our company IRC chat room , with people from the UK , Missouri , Kansas , San Diego and East Oakland , we worked to evolve our experience , about six of us .
Two and a half coders , a front end person , a community support person , a producer , and a game designer / writer .
Not enough engineers , but we could n't hire many - during a technology boom engineers are scarce .
I pitched in making web views as the Producer ( the views and occasionally controllers part of Ruby on Rails ' MVC ) .
Another major lesson from running a software startup : engineers are the dreammakers and everyone is in fierce competition for talented programmers .
M envisioned a virtual world on top of the internet : a battle between order and chaos , where we supplied the information weapons .
For charitable sorts , there were crates for treasure to be left on web sites .
For aggressive provocateurs , there were mines that exploded and shook your browser window when you hit their target URL .
Surfing with our toolbar game on at times made the internet feel alive with play in the margins !
In the spring of 2008 , it looked like we had a promising game service that was getting a lot of buzz .
We were spending slower than we 'd planned , but we were running out of money .
So the game designer / writer M and myself the producer shifted to fundraising for about 14 weeks of March - June in 2008 .
This is a huge attention - suck : tracking down introductions and opportunities , developing presentations , taking feedback , corresponding , prioritizing , traveling , pitching .
I started off with a stupidly fat slide deck .
I thought it was important to walk through people through the idea , the history of the idea , the market context , the team , the upside , the plans .
But a rigid linear presentation was anathema for busy people who have seen a ton of pitches .
Each VC had their set of questions and usually could n't sit through more than 3 slides .
Here 's a PDF of our pitch deck from March 2008 : 200803 - GameLayers - SeriesA-09.pdf - 26.6
Megs , 62 slides
Two months later , we had changed our pitch - style .
Here 's a PDF of our pitch deck from May 2008 : 200805 - GameLayers - SeriesA-22-Shasta.pdf - 15.4 megs , 44 total slides , 8 in the appendix .
We learned to show fewer slides and then just talk with potential investors .
Often these were smart folks with experience building companies so we had a lot to learn and at best it was a good conversation , when we learned to relax on the formal presentation .
We kept a stack of slides in our appendix ; if they asked about " competitor products " or " projected burn rate & operating expenses " or " DAU versus MAU over the last three months " we could pull those up .
There were some soul - crushing moments : emerging from a red - eye flight into a room with six hard - driving rich dudes who want to know why we do n't have explosions or blood in our game .
Or why we 're not a platform for embedding other people 's flash games .
Or why we 're so deluded about the size of the market .
We were intent on building one game , because our team was n't big enough to support multiple products .
We did n't want to spread ourselves across multiple products when we had n't proven the idea and built a successful instance of this new kind of game .
We thought we might build a platform someday - opening up our tech for anyone to upload their games .
But we wanted to get the core experience bolted together first before we supported other developers .
Here 's a PMOG Experience video we produced as we were going out of closed beta , circa May 2008 .
Second Round of Funding
Early June 2008 , one of the craziest weeks of my life :
Saturday : Get Married near Yosemite
Monday : Move from 1400 sq / ft loft to 400 sq / ft apartment
Tuesday : Sign Second Round Term Sheet for $ 1.5 million
Friday :
We fire someone for the first time
In June 2008 M and I were married in Central California .
Our investors and co-founder from the UK joined our friends and family betrothing the Chief Creative Officer and Chief Executive Officer of GameLayers .
Wedding ceremony was Saturday .
Monday we moved from our large East Oakland loft into a tiny apartment in an awesome part of San Francisco 's Mission District .
Tuesday we signed a term sheet with Rob Coneybeer from Shasta Ventures for a total $ 1.5 million round that we had just raised after a long roadshow together .
Friday we had to fire someone for the first time .
It was extremely intense running a startup , and being married to a co-founder / board member .
Nonshop high - pressure togetherness .
We put off our honeymoon and kept working .
Fundraising on an offbeat game on an unproven platform was challenging .
Fortunately we found an investment partner who saw the potential in the widespread social experience we were building : Rob Coneybeer from Shasta Ventures .
Rob joined the GameLayers board along with M , Bryce and myself - leaving an empty fifth seat we did n't worry about filling .
June 2008 : Portfolio.com : " Having Fun , Making Money " : " a startup turns the entire Web into a game , aiming to steer players toward and away from certain sites .
Will advertisers play along ? "
We raised another $ 1.51 million dollars - $ 1 million from Shasta , and another $ 500 k from OATV .
Our two angel investors Joi and Richard had the option to put in another $ 50 k each , but they chose not to .
GameLayers was now valued at just under $ 5 million !
GameLayers Round 2 Term Sheet with Rob / Shasta - a triumphant document for us .
We were running on fumes when the second round of money came through .
Now , August 2008 , the money was in our bank account , and we ramped up plans to expand our operations , reach into new markets , improve our featureset , and draw in a ton more users !
Rob showed up with a lot of enthusiasm and ideas for the project , giving us a boost of energy .
We looked forward to focusing on our game - making again , after months on the road !
Kicking More Ass , Sooner
Our first venture capitalists OATV primarily work with nascent startups .
Bryce focused on helping us build a team , and helping us get a rhythm building and releasing software .
Then Bryce helped us present ourselves as a valuable company for other larger VC investment .
Our second VC Shasta was accustomed to blowing out a product with promise , making it grow seriously fast .
Rob wanted to see progress and drive momentum .
One year after we started , we finally stopped working from home and moved into an office .
76 2nd Street , the top floor of an old building for about $ 3100 a month , space for 14 people to grow into .
One of the biggest challenges for me was learning to prune my stories .
I would get a call from Rob at 9.30 pm on a Tuesday , how 's it going ?
And I would immediately start listing the bugs that were on the top of my mind , the problems we were working to solve .
Looking back I believe Rob wanted to know how we were doing strategically , and maybe a sense of confidence from me that we were kicking butt overall .
I 've been a journalist for years ; in this case , my urge to tell a compelling human drama was not necessarily compatible with " here 's a clear path to acceleration and growth . "
VCs are n't looking for spin , but I think they want to know that if you 're thrashing on bugs it 's part of a coherent larger vision .
Becoming a CEO and raising this money was committing to kicking more ass , sooner - an exhiliarating proposition .
And because I believed in our idea , I wanted to drive it forward as fast as possible .
I charged in , learned everything I could from books , advisors , news , and worked to be the best possible CEO Decider Visionary Leader Capitalist .
But occasionally I was too in the weeds .
Scavenging on Craig 's List for deals on monitors and printers to save $ 100 when tens of thousands of dollars of employee time was hurtling forwards towards a moving target .
Running a startup is a crazy range of affairs to manage : the unceasing search for engineers , customers having weird issues with common computer setups , investor relations , the mood and productivity of the folks who gave up other opportunities to join our cause , the amount of cash in our bank account , our landlord refusing to install heaters so employees are buying USB - powered heating mittens , state - by - state tax and liability law , we 're not paying ourselves much and we 're eating out constantly and we 're paying rent to live close to the office in one of the world 's most expensive cities so personal money is tight , someone else just raised 3 x as much money as we did to do the same thing with a larger team .
And OMG the entire world economy is cratering !
CEO Search
In November 2008 the board met for dinner at a SOMA restaurant called Salt House : M , Rob and Bryce .
Rob and Bryce suggested Gamelayers needed a new CEO , and my wife M agreed : we needed a firm hand to turn this into a business , someone who could raise confidence with another round from more heavy - duty investors .
Someone I could learn running a company from .
I had gone from game journalist , to game prototyper , to game company pitchman , to game company head , and now I had some reckoning to do .
I was not providing leadership for GameLayers that left my board confident in the future .
Time for me to search out a person better suited to my role at GameLayers !
That was an intense ego slam .
We spent $ 33 k ( first installment on a $ 100 k retainer with the Cole Group ) and now a parade of CEO candidates came through .
It was a fascinating experience - to meet guys who believed they could make our company evolve and succeed .
After interviews , I did n't think many of them were smarter or better - suited than I was .
I appreciated the chance to browse smart potential CEOs , but I also occasionally resented spending upwards of 20 % of my time trying to replace myself .
It seemed like a confidence game , could I learn enough and re-apply for my own job , owning the confidence of my investors and my co-founder ?
Or was I better off in another role , leaving the brass tacks of business to someone else so I could focus on building a successful product experience ?
The global economy tanked before we could find a replacement CEO ; I stayed on by necessity .
We were running out of money to pay salary for a big new CEO , and with the stock market plummeting , we could n't expect to raise another round quickly - we had to make PMOG succeed with what we had .
Primary Objectives
Fortunately , through our Executive Search we found an amazing advisor Michael Buhr .
Michael was an executive at eBay and the CEO of StumbleUpon , a Firefox toolbar helping people experience the breadth of the web .
Michael had worked at a 1990s game console company called 3DO but he was n't deep into games .
Instead Michael knew about motiviating people and executing on business objectives .
Michael was a great manager , a great leader , and he became our advisor and executive coach .
For a few hours a week by phone or in - person , Michael helped us shape the short story of the company , putting forward a vision for concrete action .
He sat down with the founders and asked hard questions so we could substantiate our plans .
Michael would have been an ideal CEO for GameLayers - he understood the Firefox toolbar space , he would have given us freedom to run product within business constraints , he was fanastic to work with - we left every meeting with him feeling smarter and more able to have fun at a challenging job .
But Michael already had a job and was n't drawn in by the opportunity to lead GameLayers .
Michael explained to me that a CEO needs to be able to state his or her primary objectives at a moment 's notice .
What is your core focus ?
Use your core focus as a razor - everything else is distraction .
In late 2008 we wanted to get more users to play our game , get them to be more active once they started , and get them to make friends and invite more folks into the game .
We called these three things Accessibility , Engagement , Social .
Then Michael asked us to name 3 - 4 efforts we were undertaking to move each of those forward .
Here 's our December 2008 GameLayers strategic priorities document , the type of focused thinking we developed with Michael 's help .
The Nethernet
We renamed our game from PMOG to The Nethernet ( TNN ) : perhaps calling it a place instead of an acronym would make the product more tangible and accessible .
The Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences nominated PMOG for MMO of the year for 2009 ; we lost to Blizzard 's World of Warcraft .
We had more attention , and we scored a huge distribution deal - being a recommended Firefox plugin by Mozilla .
Suddenly we had a ton of traffic , and our servers began to groan .
We had an active thriving community .
One of our early hires was a part - time community manager : Joe Wagner , a San Diego State University student with a passion for online game community .
He helped surface issues from players and communicate our intentions to the passionate fans .
We were consistently honored and delighted by the folks who shared our game with us .
They made a podcast , the Tubenauts .
They ran a gambling circuit using our currency .
They made thousands of guided tours of the web .
They banded together to create games within our game .
They stepped up to serve as Stewards : guides , ambassadors , chaperones and unpaid expanders of our game world .
They supported us , expanded our vision of what was possible , and made us believe that we were helping bring beauty and delight to citizens of the web .
These days I would do a full day of 10 - 12 hours at the office , then have some dinner , maybe a beer and a bong hit , and work another four hours or so .
I avoided caffeine nearly throughout ; light substance use in the evening allowed me to unwind briefly and then plunge back in with renewed vigor .
Some times late at night I might sneak in some work on things like GameLayers promotional vids to post on YouTube and hopefully find new audiences :
I wanted to make an action trailer , giving an urgency and excitement to The Nethernet .
Searching online music archives for a free soundtrack M and I found a song called " ИHTEPHET ПИЭДOБOЛЫ " by a Russian band called Distemper with a serious propulsive drum track opener .
The title was offensive perhaps if you translated it .
The lyrics ( translated from Russian ) are about people getting stuck - up through overuse of online networked communications .
What a coincidence !
Internet commentary and a great drum track !
We would use the instrumentals for our internet warfare game and we would attribute the song in the original Russian title .
It would be an easter egg , if someone looked it up : they 'd find out the PMOG video soundtrack was a song called " Cunts on the Internet " !
We told our colleagues and they all felt it was a terribly bad idea to associate this with the company and the brand .
So we decided to play it safe .
I published the trailer with no soundtrack and moved on .
Now I 'll put it up here , mostly because we picked the music before we knew the title - when we translated it , our minds were blown .
It was sad to rip the music out to get it released on time , with no awesome soundtrack , and no bawdy cultural commentary :-(
Let 's New CTO
Working long - distance with our Dartford , UK - based co-founder and CTO Duncan Gough had allowed a round - the - clock approach to running GameLayers and building PMOG .
We would chat in IRC continually , just before each of us went to bed , and check back in , in the morning .
All of us chained to our laptops in different time zones , watching the servers hum , hacking on code , design , google docs , keynote slide shows , photoshop , textmate , ruby on rails , capistrano , memcache , highrise , github , hiring , staffing , management , strategy , focus .
After two years of that we needed to have GameLayers working in one shared location .
Getting Duncan a visa to move to the US had been an expensive challenge , and Duncan could n't move from the UK to SF , so we parted ways in March 2009 .
Here 's a snapshot of what was happening that month , and stats from our game : the April 2009 Board of Directors presentation : 200904 - GameLayersBoard.pdf 16.6 megs , 41 slides .
Now we had a lot of traffic , overwhelmed servers , and no CTO .
I devoted all my time to finding a replacement , and a recruiter lead us to John Cwikla .
He had the exact experience we felt we needed : he 'd taken products with some potential , and some stability issues , and gave them a solid software foundation from which to grow .
A veteran of multiple startups , Cwikla hit the ground running as CTO in May 2009 .
We revised our infrastructure some , and prepared to exit " beta " - to launch a product to earn money .
Revenue ?
PMOG / The Nethernet was expensive to run .
We had built prototypes to prove ideas ; we had n't built something that was conservative with computing resources .
We had thrown money at web hosting , figuring that our hosting costs would only grow more expensive if we were successful .
Cwikla rigged up The Nethernet to run using the cloud , basically preparing the software to scale inexpensively .
Unfortunately we were chained to a ~ $ 20 k - a- month dedicated cluster server and service contract with Engine Yard from before his time .
I worked to lower our monthly bill but Cwikla 's code could n't immediately trim our overhead .
Mid-2009 we were pressed up against a wall , watching the money remaining steadily decline .
Sad times - we took salary cuts , we laid people off , including our talented , optimistic UI / UX designer Kristin Neinhuis , and a promising writer Seraphina Brennan .
We had tooled around with innovation , piling features into our web browser game .
But when it came down to it , we had n't baked - in monetization .
We had a few ideas for earning revenue from the Nethernet ; based on our small traffic size and custom platform , selling ads seemed to be an uphill battle .
Plus the most popular Firefox extensions were about avoiding advertisements ( Adblock Plus ) .
So we thought , we 'll give people the basic toolset for free , but we 'll ask them to pay for the more crafty and crazy tools .
Microtransactions !
We called the currency " bacon " which was a sort of inside joke in our player community , and we had fun talking about bacon as a currency : " bring home the bacon " , maybe units of currency could be called " bacon bits " and so on .
We launched monetization in a hurry and made a few key mistakes : we took away powers players had already and started charging money for them .
We did n't give players much warning .
Selling bacon , monetizing the Nethernet was an abject failure .
Plenty of vocal players hated what we 'd done .
Some folks understood why and were generous - one woman even ordered us a mega - pack of beer in congratulations .
But there were n't enough spenders .
We made about a hundred dollars a day the first few days .
Within three weeks of launching monetization , we were averaging under $ 20 a day .
$ 20 a day is $ 600 a month ; two orders of magnitude off from where we needed to be .
Considering we had a burn rate over $ 60 k a month , we were profoundly far away from having a sustainable or profitable game studio .
When we launched PMOG we called our new players " Shoats " a word we discovered that meant " young pig . "
Ultimately with The Nethernet we were n't able to turn the Shoats into Bacon !
One Life Remaining
We felt burned by the Firefox toolbar market .
Reading stuff like " who would pay for anything in a firefox toolbar ? " from our players meant that we felt like we were a long way away from sustaining our company on that platform .
It had been a gamble to build the first big multiplayer social game in a browser extension , and it looked like fail : the world was n't ready or did n't need what we were building .
So we had about $ 500 k remaining at this time .
I drew up plans to fire everyone except one programmer , to see if we could keep things running and figure out where to find some more investment or revenue .
Marc Adams was a former U.S. Navy SWCC who was accustomed to 30 hour coding marathons at least once per week .
Even working remotely from St. Louis Marc was so plugged into our pace that it felt like we could maybe sustain the company on him alone .
Marc was profoundly committed to his craft ; he was an inspiring engineer to work with .
Michael Buhr suggested we look at the last $ 500 k as money we could use for a another startup .
Maybe we if we had a small slice of a much larger pie : we had a functioning kick butt web games team , and we refocused on the most profitable market within our reach : Facebook games .
This was June 2009 and social RPG like Mafia Wars were tearing up the charts and making good money ( a game called Farm Town had just debuted at # 4 ) .
We were a Ruby on Rails shop , we did n't have any Flash experience , so we decided that we could build a social RPG in Rails in a few weeks .
Then we could skin it to target different demographics .
We figured that we could have multiple games up on Facebook within a few weeks .
Facebook : Dictator Wars & Super Cute Zoo
So we shut down our toolbar game PMOG / The Nethernet because it was a huge drain on resources and focus .
That was sad , but it was easy because we were losing money so fast .
In the absence of PMOG , some of our most active and frustrated players went on to create Nova Initia , another browser toolbar MMO of playful annotation .
Meanwhile the five of us , Justin , M , Cwikla , Alex , Marc , we built a social RPG game engine that could be rapidly re-skinned .
For the first skin we chose a geopolitical theme - taking mafia battles and doing them bigger and more tough : Dictator Wars .
We made the theme cartoony to sanitize and parody the horrendous political content .
Here 's a Youtube video promoting Dictator Wars :
I spent ten weeks reading books about Dictators and writing out content for our Dictator Wars content spreadsheet - it was fun to be a bit of a writer again .
From books like Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader by Bradley Martin and The Emperor by Ryszard Kapuscinski I learned terribly sad things about the worst possible violations of trust between leaders and citizens .
I had dreams about dictators for years afterwards .
I amused myself by twittering secretly as the_kim_jong_il scheming to build a viral social media campaign for our twisted game .
We did n't want to fail as a studio because we'd only targeted one macho audience .
So we went immediately to work on a second game , targeting women : Super Cute Zoo .
We thought we could add some Flash pets and an improved UI and attract multiple audiences to the basic spreadsheet RPG gameplay .
We five people launched two Facebook games in 14 weeks .
It was a long march of long days , after years of having made one sort of game , we had to start all over to make other kinds of games .
We succeeded at our mission , we rebooted our studio !
We got some nice press coverage from Inside Social Games : The Road to Dictatorship .
We were contending on the most exciting new platform for online games !
We had to learn about Facebook fast .
For example , in 2009 each Facebook user got a certain number of invites per day .
Because we were fiddling with our game , we had our allocation reduced from 30 to 4 invites a day .
That was a huge penalty , a giant growth slowdown for weeks when we only had months to live .
We spent a little bit of money on pay - per - click install advertising .
But we soon learned that other games were spending ten or one hundred times as much money .
We were advised to spend $ 50 k our launch week , to place on the charts and get noticed .
We did n't have that kind of money , and unfortunately we did n't have that kind of time .
Facebook games were changing fast .
Increasingly farming games were all the rage .
Players were expecting higher levels of interactivity .
More polish .
Our zoo - themed game seemed strange as a social RPG - any game that promised you a chance to build a zoo wanted to be point and click , instead Super Cute Zoo featured reading on static web pages .
Here 's a stats snapshot , mid-October : Dictator Wars has 28 k registered users , with 1700 a day playing ( about 6 % ) .
Average revenue per day was $ 53 - about 3 ¢ per daily active user .
The game was growing by about 100 people per day - a paltry .3 % growth rate ( damn our constrained Facebook invitations ! ) .
$ 50 a day is about $ 1500 a month ; we needed 40 times that or more to sustain our company .
We had busted ass , and we 'd put something up on Facebook , but we did n't have the time or money to help it evolve into a successful property .
With online social games , launching is just the beginning of the hard work .
The Last Ditch
As part of the second round of funding , Shasta and OATV had secured the right to purchase Warrants to the tune of a few hundred thousand dollars .
Shasta wanted to be able to buy a larger part of the company at the Series A price if we took off .
Late 2008 we voted to extend their right to purchase the warrants , in case we needed the easy cash injection .
During 2009 we aimed to be worthy of these cash injections but by late 2009 there was no additional money coming from our investors .
Here 's the last GameLayers , Inc. Board of Directors slideshow : 200910 - GameLayersBoard.pdf 3.8 megs , 25 slides .
I spent much of the fall of 2009 calling people I knew who ran social gaming companies , seeing if I could find anyone to buy us , to buy our assets , to hire our team - to provide job security for our employees and some return for our investors .
I even worked up a patent application for " System for Sharing Tasks between Players of an Online Game " to see if that might increase the value of GameLayers and help us find a lifeline to keep making games .
We had some acquisition interest from larger social gaming companies .
But week - by - week the social RPG format was losing momentum in the market against the mighty Farmville .
Basically , I could see people thinking , " why buy this company when their games are n't growing that fast - in a few weeks we 'll try to hire their engineers maybe . "
Here 's some visualizations of our dwindling finances in last 2009 :
October 2009 I was invited to a GameOn Finance conference in Toronto .
I blame Jason della Rocca , a relentless connector of people and ideas .
Participating there was cathartic - I really enjoyed a chance to try to save other entrepreneurs from my problems and get inspired by other business experiments .
Some nice folks interviewed me and posted it on YouTube .
November 2009 we pulled down our two Facebook games - they were n't making enough money , and we could n't commit to long - term service .
We took the remaining money to pay off the company 's obligations , and arranged a decent severance for our people .
We laid everyone off , and took a little bit of remaining money to put The Nethernet , our original game back online to run quietly at thenethernet.com .
Aftermathematics
What a sobering time !
Begging people to pay pennies on the dollar for years of work .
Begging people to hire away your best people .
And then failing , and calling people who had given so much to this company to tell them I had to stop paying them , and soon they 'd have no paid health insurance .
Starting a company is stressful , running a company is stressful , winding down a failed company is stressful .
We needed a break , but we were broke .
So we cashed in airline miles and spent on our credit cards to finally take a honeymoon , 18 months after our wedding .
December 2009 , three weeks of inexpensive tropical luxury on an island in Thailand .
January we returned to the San Francisco area to seek our fortune and pay down our debt .
By February 2010 M got a job as a Producer at Playfish , a social / Facebook game company .
M hired one of the remaining GameLayers engineers to work at Playfish : Alex Friedman , a persistent gamer / programmer who we hired out of college based on his combination of game design and engineering chops .
I helped our tireless engineer Marc Adams find work with Facebook - game maker Turpitude Design .
In March 2010 I got a job as a Producer at ngmoco : ) , a mobile social games company , working with an old friend Alan Yu. ngmoco : ) soon hired our community manager Joe Wagner .
In mid-March 2010 I presented a version of this story at the Game Developers Conference , announcing that we were going to open - source our multiplayer client and server software .
Six months later the code emerged in the public domain .
Maybe it can be of use to some budding online social play experiments !

Terry Thurlow was our consulting Finance Director .
She was recommended to us by OATV when we raised our first round - paying her an hourly rate would ensure that we had all our paperwork in order for future financial events .
Having a consulting finance director was a great aid , from day one until the day the lights went dark in our bank account .
Terry had experience at Industrial Light & Magic and CollabNet , an open source framework , plus Foxmarks - she was well versed in the many various trauma of business operations and it was always entertaining to run numbers with her .
Plus I really did n't have to worry about the books throughout .
M and I decided to get divorced in October 2010 .
I would suggest to anyone that if you 're in love with someone , the feeling is mutual , and you decided to go into serious business together , you should immediately commit to ongoing couples counseling with a quality therapist .
You 're going to need professional third party help to calibrate and prioritize your relationship through the stresses of business .
Holy Smokes it 's intense .
Looking Back
Founding a company and developing a business was a wild fast education .
By comparison , grad school was a relaxing time to explore ideas and make art .
Running a startup was constant adrenaline : you must learn while doing .
I 'm grateful to my business partners for their patience during my learning time ; I 'll share my takeaways here to maybe help fast - forward another entrepreneur .
We built it all , ourselves
In 1994 I worked at Hotwired , launching one of the world 's first commercial content web sites .
We had to build everything .
One of my co-workers there was Brian Behlendorf who was helping to write the popular web server Apache in tandem with launching hotwired.com .
We helped determine the initial size for ad banners on the web .
We drove business to Organic , one of the very first web advertising companies .
Everything from scratch , on expensive Silicon Graphics server hardware .
Hah !
Sixteen years later you can borrow social infrastructure from Facebook , rent a scaling number of machines from Amazon Web Services .
Use Google to host your corporate email , documents , spreadsheets , presentations for free .
House your corporate memory banks on Highrise for a small monthly fee .
There 's a plugin or social service for nearly any human interaction you might want to run ; you just need to provide a new sort of glue : mixing and matching web services to come up with compelling new ways for people to express themselves , to spend their time and their money .
We started building PMOG in 2006 , launched GameLayers in 2007 - that was just two years before Facebook became the dominant social plumbing for casual online entertainment .
We built everything for ourselves - user profiles , friend connections , message boards , invitation systems .
That took up a lot of our time - if we had started in 2009 , we would have used Facebook as plumbing for our social graph and focused on what made our game fun .
Also Cloud Computing emerged in 2008 - 2009 .
Perhaps the Cloud could have saved us from our huge hosting fees and worrying about how many servers to commit to .
But we were committed to a non-Cloud architecture and that seriously chewed into our budget .
I feel like online service - building has gotten so much easier since 2007 when we started GameLayers ; it 's fun to imagine this tech being even more accessible in another few years !
Hurrah !
I Learned
Being CEO taught me to focus on a few key priorities .
I learned to be ready to present a focused summary of our biggest opportunities at a moment 's notice : here 's who we are , here 's our big vision , and here 's how we 're building to succeed .
I learned that companies are started by ordinary humans with big ideas , who convince other humans who have money to support that dream for a finite amount of time .
I learned that people with money also have ideas , and its important to understand accepting money means you 're going to be spending time aligning yourself with them .
Being accountable to my board of directors on a monthly basis was helpful : I had to pull my head up to look at the business objectives and discuss them with a smart committed crew committed to this shared undertaking .
I learned that the more of your idea you can build without financial support , the more leverage you 'll have when it comes to raising money and attracting interest .
I learned that $ 300 / day is a great " lifestyle business " - $ 300 / day supports one or two folks making something they believe in , catering to a particular market .
But $ 300 / day is death for a 5 - 9 person startup .
If you 've raised venture capital , you 're aiming for $ 3,000 / day and $ 30,000 and beyond .
Sometimes it seemed like maybe PMOG would have been a better " lifestyle business " , meaning if we had prototyped and then started making money off the bat , we would have pulled down maybe enough to support the three founders at a smaller scale with something manageable .
We could have grown PMOG organically , gradually , at a breathable pace !
But we decided to go for an amazing accelerated roller coaster ride instead , to pour gasoline on a small campfire .
I learned that you can prototype an incredible viable product with people in far - away places .
But it 's hard to move truly fast when you 're not in the same time zone .
Ultimately being in the same room with people is a profound accelerator for collaboration and productivity .
I learned that engineers are the most important part of software startups , and hiring a lot of engineers is a good way to ensure you can evolve fast and increase the value of your organization .
I learned there 's a metric shit - ton of competition for engineer hiring , it 's laughable .
Every startup that has a web site with a jobs section with " engineer " positions listed .
Fierce competition !
I learned to value the chance to meet with CEOs from other software startups .
I would drive to Palo Alto or Mountain View to talk to these people facing similar struggles .
It felt like community , I got great wisdom .
Usually I tracked them down because we shared an investor or a common friend .
Several OATV companies were funded at the same time ( Get Satisfaction and Instructables ) and we ended up having group OATV - funded executive dinners every few months - great camaraderie with people as busy as we were .
Alan
Yu was a friend of ours ; he was working at Electronic Arts at the time .
He listed to us describe our product PMOG over sushi one night in SOMA .
Alan suggested that between gameplay , theme and platform , it 's advisable to limit innovation to one of those three when making a new game .
With PMOG , we were doing an unusual game ( leaving information tools on web sites for other people ) with an unusual theme ( steampunk was not mainstream ) and we were building a massively multiplayer online game for a platform that had never really seen much of a game on it before ( Firefox only had a few very basic arcade games , and one attempt to build multiplayer pong ) .
We were innovating on three for three : gameplay , theme AND platform .
That 's a whole lotta innovation in one product experience yow .
Now I think more about focusing innovation , creating a more approachable experience for game players .
I did n't have much time for reading while I was in the midst of this software startup , but I read Jessica Livingston 's book Founders at Work .
Founders at Work was hugely comforting to me , as I read of all manner of small software business permutations ; people who succeeded and failed and pivoted and dealt with all the complexities that were so a part of my life .
Daniel James was actually part of my education from an early stage - because he shared his data year after year with the audience at the Game Developers Conference , and then on the web through his site The Flogging Will Continue Until Morale Improves .
Here 's a sample presentation : " Metrics for a Brave New Whirled " - transparent about data most companies guard .
I 've learned to see more of the entire ecology of media / software innovation : from the limited partners LPs who fund the Venture Capitalists VCs , funding and prodding the founders and executives .
I 've been a disgruntled employee who does n't understand why a company does n't hew closer to its ideals ; now I see so much nested economic activity that I tend to bite my tongue before critiquing corporate actors .
I learned that distracting employees should be laid off immediately .
Firing people is hard , but if you 're a startup founder debating whether someone should be fired , they should be fired .
There 's such a limited amount of time with a focused team ; in a company under 10 people one underperformer brings everyone down and ties up invaluable time .
I learned to think of firing someone as " helping them find a more suitable opportunity " because if they are n't thriving at your company , no one wins .
Laying off people was a fucking serious painful thing because these people were contributing doing important work to drive the company forward , but we just did n't have the money to survive .
It 's a sobering , terrible thing to have to say " goodbye , fare well " to someone who you 've asked to give up other opportunities to join your crazy mission that could be a great success for everyone involved if only we were n't months from cash - related asphyxiation .
First I developed the reflex to test " I have a cool idea " against " I wonder if it would pay for itself " , and then " I wonder if that 's just a lifestyle business or a real company . "
What Happens to the stuff we built ?
Through the company ending and the divorce , I Justin Hall now own the code , art , trademarks , and URLs for The Nethernet , PMOG , Super Cute Zoo , Dictator Wars and GameLayers .
Wow !
It 's all worthless unless someone invests more time and money to make something compelling from those bits , bytes and ideas .
Social games require paid servers to run , engineers to keep them alive , community managers to run events and designers to make new content .
None of this stuff runs without constant tinkering .
So all these assets are aging quietly on hard drives awaiting purpose ; at least the code for PMOG is open source so it might have life beyond .
The Nethernet was up and running , paid through December 2012 .
You could play it with a copy of Firefox 3 and a link to http://thenethernet.com/.
Bless 'em there was a handful of players up to the very end , three years since we worked on the game .
For 2013 and beyond it will cost about $ 130 a month to host .
Who wants to pay that ?
Paying down a year of credit card debt after my startup does n't make me too inclined to support the Nethernet indefinitely .
Besides , there 's no support for modern browsers , and no programmers ready to evolve this software .
Releasing TNN as open source was a nice gesture but it did n't summon keyboard - weilding brainiac badasses ready to update this game .
Twenty years from now the " social games " of the 2010s will be screenshots but not anything anyone can play ; without servers you can't boot up and run a social game .
I confess I did n't really play the Nethernet after I laid everyone off at the end of GameLayers .
I actually switched browsers - I needed to clear my head and now the game only works in Firefox 3 .
Rebuilding it for Chrome / IE / Safari is a challenge ; maybe we could somehow port it to a floating HTML5 pallette or some other web hackery .
I considered a kickstarter - type crowdfunding campaign to keep evolving this thing .
But then I 'd have to start beating the drum for this failed kind of gameplay , at best buying it another few months of life before it needs to find funds to stay online again .
I 'll be keeping an eye out for projects that make use of the open source code !
And I 'll be keeping out for people who evolve the idea of games embedded in our daily activites , and social play across information space .
Running a Startup or Having a Balanced Life
I threw myself into this startup .
It felt like a combination of a cause , a lottery ticket , an identity , a vehicle for realizing a better me , and a better life for my family .
Looking back I savaged a number of my relationships through inattention and stress .
I might have made a better CEO if I had taken some time for hobbies , reading , chatting , travel - some life balance .
But I can still remember life in the startup trenches ; I felt so important , like my every minute could feed this hungry entity and make it more likely to succeed .
I felt so profoundly responsible and I got off on that feeling .
After being CEO of a startup , being a Producer at ngmoco : ) was so nice because I could just focus on making a product , to not worry about payroll and investors .
Working just 60 or 70 hours a week feels like a relative vacation .
Being CEO meant I woke up at 4 am most days in sheer panic about any one of a dozen looming madnesses .
Now I wake up at 4 am mostly because I had spicy garlic noodles .
I feel like my churning mind lent itself naturally to running a business .
I like to deliberate over potential future issues and opportunties .
John Lilly was at that time CEO of Firefox , and we had some useful meetings .
He advised me : " do n't borrow problems " - do n't worry about things you can't control .
Lilly also suggested being a CEO is often about looking over multiple fires and deciding which fire needs water most because you can't ever put them all out .
I now understand that most businesses do n't succeed .
While success is rare , opportunities to learn and evolve are limitless .
My investors were gracious to the end , explaining that they knew they were taking a risk when they invested , and they appreciated the work we 'd done to make a good go of GameLayers .
I see them every few months now .
Months after GameLayers ended , I heard about another failed startup - this one had been funded by family members .
As a result of the startup failing , someone had a mortgage they could n't afford , and there was bad blood between the businessperson and their supportive kin .
So I 'm glad I worked with professional investors ; they shared valuable experience , and they could afford to take a chance on this idea without painful loss .
I felt supercharged being responsible for a shared destiny , and though it did n't work , I would definitely do it again with the right concept or team .
Work is best when it 's fun and meaningful .
Next time I would want to have more balance in my life ; exercise , socializing , family time .
But maybe I 'm just saying that because I 'm older :-)
I 'm not sure whether I 'd be a good CEO again ; I 'd definitely do better than last time .
Mostly I 'm excited to pitch in wherever I can with compelling people and amazing ideas on crazy challenging new networks .
Why did we fail ?
What could we have done ?
We saw three competitors start up : RocketOn and WelloHorld and WebWars - each making some version of " browser plug - in based gaming across all the web " .
And our players were frustrated when we took The Nethernet offline and so they created their own PMOG - ish toolbar game : Nova Initia .
None of these has cracked the code of widespread browserplay goodtimes as far as I 've seen yet .
Maybe browsing the web and playing a game are two / too distinct activities for most folks .
Flickr was often on my mind : the popular photo - sharing service from the 2000s that was purchased by Yahoo .
Flickr started off as an attempt to make a complex web browser game ; a sort of MMO for comparative literature majors called " Game Neverending . "
The Flickr founders figured out that photo sharing might be a better use of the tech they 'd built .
I thought about how we might adapt PMOG to other web sharing , but there was no ready product coming out of our toolbar .
And we really wanted to make an entertainment experience .
Working at ngmoco : ) has developed in me an intense discipline for " compulsion loops " - what are the core activities in a game that keep people engaged ?
How does one in - game activity lead readily to another ?
And what is the core fun at the heart of your game ?
Ultimately I believe PMOG lacked too much core game compulsion to drive enthusiastic mass adoption .
The concept of " leave a trail of playful web annotations " was too abstruse for the bulk of folks to take up .
Yes being a Firefox MMO was a weird and challenging hurdle to adoption , but people will go to insane lengths for a good time .
If we had presented an amazing fun entertainment product with a clear path to fun , we would have had a larger audience .
More players would have made it easier to raise money and make money .
We heard the feedback " I do n't know what I 'm supposed to do " from new players and people who tested it - we thought we could add features or somehow convince people to power through to become dedicated players .
Looking back I believe we needed to clear the decks , swallow our pride , and make something that was easier to have fun with , within the first few moments of interaction .
That may have meant scrapping " passively multiplayer " as a game concept , or a toolbar as the mode of interaction .
Those were pretty core to our initial business plan , so it took us a long time to see those concepts through to revenue failure .
Then we pivoted : we shifted strategy from " build the best game played across the web " to " build games to learn how to make money on Facebook . "
We brought our vision in from the horizon to our bank account .
It prepared us employees for careers working in social games ( 4 of 5 of the last GameLayers employees were making social games for Facebook or mobile within 6 months of the company closing ) .
The sector was hot and we learned it .
But what if we had doubled down on our goal of building a big game ?
" Okay , so The Nethernet can't support itself .
We 're going to break apart that technology into something smaller , a simpler game to play across the web " or " We 're going to take what we 've learned about play across the web and make a big game you can play anywhere on your mobile device . "
Would we have found a sustainable path by pivoting towards another bold future instead of quick Facebook monetization ?
Do n't know , can't know - happy to live on , to see all kinds of new games made on new platforms by new dreamers .
Ultimately I 'm honored and humbled by the chance I had to work with fantastic motivated brilliant people each day on dynamic complex problems , to take an idea and make it real , to test our theories on the human market , and to fail with as much support as we rose .
We did n't win the capitalist gold medal but hopefully we generated some useful knowledge and entertainment !

[ Last touched up 2 December 2012 ]
KAMPALA , Uganda — Even as Uganda ’s parliament considers the Anti-Homosexuality Bill — which calls for the death penalty for some gay acts — a group of about 100 Ugandan gays and lesbians held a secret meeting to determine how to stand up for their rights .
The clandestine conference was held a hotel function room in downtown Kampala last week and was titled “ Standing on the side of Love , Re-imagining Valentine ’s Day . ”
Organized by the Rev. Mark Kiyimba of the Ugandan Unitarian Universalist Church , and financially supported by the Austria Foundation , the meeting was a strategy session to discuss how to respond to the bill .
The participants resolved to petition the Ugandan Speaker of Parliament to scrap the bill and to instead move to decriminalize homosexuality .
“ Our conference showed that religion does not need to be an enemy to the cause of LGBT [ lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ] concerns , ” said Kiyimba , who declares himself a married bi-sexual .
“ What is at stake here is religious freedom , human rights and minority protections . ”
Kiyimba said the conference is “ a kick - off or starting point for us , against this bill . ”
He said in March he will take his petition to various countries , including the U.S. , to galvanize international support for Uganda ’s gays .
Most of the participants wore bright red T - shirts with a heart showing the “ gay pride ” rainbow colors in the center .
“ This was different from other conferences , ” said one gay man attending the meeting , who declined to be named , fearing reprisal .
“ Gay banners and flags , no pretense , it was very straightforward . ”
Two Americans attended the meeting .
Gay - rights activist and Episcopal minister Rev. Patricia Ackerman of New York City as well as the Rev. Marlin Lavanhar of the All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church , Tulsa , Okla .
No sooner had the meeting taken place than a newspaper report highlighted how dangerous it was .
Kampala 's inspector of police , Major General Kale Kayihura , said he was unaware of the gay conference but vowed to arrest participants if he found them , according to a report in the Kampala Daily Monitor .
However , Kayihura also showed that he is not completely on the side of the anti-gay campaigners .
Kayihura denied a permit to anti-gay activist the Rev. Martin Ssempa who had planned to hold a “ Million Man March ” against homosexuality .
Ssempa , chairman of the National Pastors Task Force against Homosexuality , and David Bahati , member of parliament and author of the “ Anti-Homosexuality Bill , ” are at the forefront of Uganda ’s current anti-gay movement .
Ssempa responded by moving his march from Kampala to Jinja — about an hour ’s drive from Kampala and famous for containing the source of the Nile River .
About 2,000 Ugandans marched against homosexuality there .
In Kampala , instead of a mass march , Ssempa held a “ Million Prayers Vigil ” at a local church .
He said , “ this will kick - off 40 days of prayer against homosexuality , to correspond with Lent . ”
At the vigil , attended by about 300 Ugandans , including children , Ssempa performed homosexual exorcisms and showed slides of graphic gay porn to drive home his stance against homosexuality .
Bahati also gave a brief address where he admitted that there might be some changes to his bill , but that there would be a vote .
After his speech , he was invited to kneel on the floor where several pastors placed their hands upon his head and prayed that Bahati be used to “ deliver us from sodomy ! ”
The anti-gay bill , currently being debated in the legal and parliamentary affairs committee , must pass the speaker of the parliament before going to the Ugandan parliament floor for a vote .
Many speculate that a full vote might take place in early March .
Since Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni distanced himself from the bill in January it is not certain whether the bill will pass , be rejected or amended to remove the harsher punishments including the death penalty , according to some political analysts in Kampala .

Imagine a treatment that could build bones , strengthen the immune system and lower the risks of illnesses like diabetes , heart and kidney disease , high blood pressure and cancer .
Some research suggests that such a wonder treatment already exists .
It ’s vitamin D , a nutrient that the body makes from sunlight and that is also found in fish and fortified milk .
Yet despite the health potential of vitamin D , as many as half of all adults and children are said to have less than optimum levels and as many as 10 percent of children are highly deficient , according to a 2008 report in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
As a result , doctors are increasingly testing their patients ’ vitamin D levels and prescribing daily supplements to raise them .
According to the lab company Quest Diagnostics , orders for vitamin D tests surged more than 50 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 , up from the same quarter a year earlier .
And in 2008 , consumers bought $ 235 million worth of vitamin D supplements , up from $ 40 million in 2001 , according to Nutrition Business Journal .
But do n’t start gobbling down vitamin D supplements just yet .
The excitement about their health potential is still far ahead of the science .
Although numerous studies have been promising , there are scant data from randomized clinical trials .
Little is known about what the ideal level of vitamin D really is , whether raising it can improve health , and what potential side effects are caused by high doses .
And since most of the data on vitamin D comes from observational research , it may be that high doses of the nutrient do n’t really make people healthier , but that healthy people simply do the sorts of things that happen to raise vitamin D .
“ Correlation does not necessarily mean a cause - and - effect relationship , ” said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson , a Harvard professor who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston .
“ People may have high vitamin D levels because they exercise a lot and are getting ultraviolet - light exposure from exercising outdoors , ” Dr. Manson said .
“ Or they may have high vitamin D because they are health - conscious and take supplements .
But they also have a healthy diet , do n’t smoke and do a lot of the other things that keep you healthy . ”
Dr. Manson is leading a major study over the next five years that should provide answers to these questions and more .
The nationwide clinical trial is recruiting 20,000 older adults , including men 60 and older and women 65 and older , to study whether high doses of vitamin D and omega - 3 fatty acids from fish - oil supplements will lower risk for heart disease and cancer .

Dr. Manson said fish - oil supplements were included in the study because they are another promising treatment that suffers from a dearth of clinical trial evidence .
In addition , both vitamin D and fish oil are known to have an anti-inflammatory effect , but each works through a different pathway in the body , so there may be an added health benefit in combining them .
Study participants will be divided into four groups .
One will take both vitamin D and fish oil pills .
Two will take either a vitamin D or a fish - oil supplement and a placebo .
The fourth will take two placebo pills .
Vitamin D is found throughout the body and acts as a signaling mechanism to turn cells on and off .
Right now , the recommended dose from food and supplements is about 400 international units a day for most people , but most experts agree that is probably too low .
The Institute of Medicine is reviewing guidelines for vitamin D and is expected to raise the recommended daily dose .
Study participants will take 2,000 I.U. ’s of vitamin D3 , believed to be the form most easily used by the body .
The study will use one - gram supplements of omega - 3 fish oil , about 5 to 10 times the average daily intake .
The vitamin D dose is far higher than what has been used in other studies .
The well - known Women ’s Health Initiative study , for instance , tracked women taking 400 units of vitamin D and 1,000 milligrams of calcium .
The study found no overall benefit from the supplements , although women who consistently took their pills had a lower risk of hip fracture .
Even so , many experts think 400 units is far too low for any additional health benefits .
Another study , of 1,200 women , looked at the effects of 1,500 milligrams of calcium and 1,000 units of vitamin D. Women who took both supplements showed a lower risk for breast cancer over the next four years , but the numbers of actual cases — seven breast cancers in the placebo group and four in the supplement group — were too small to draw meaningful conclusions .
Although consumers may be tempted to rush out and start taking 2,000 I.U. ’s of vitamin D a day , doctors warn against it .
Several recent studies of nutrients , including vitamins E and B , selenium and beta carotene , have proved disappointing — even suggesting that high doses do more harm than good , increasing risk for heart problems , diabetes and cancer , depending on the supplement .
Despite the promise of vitamin D in observational studies , research into other supplements shows it ’s difficult to document a benefit in otherwise healthy people , and virtually impossible to predict potential harms , notes Dr. Eric A. Klein , chairman of the Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute at the Cleveland Clinic .
Dr. Klein recently worked as national coordinator for Select , a study of vitamin E and selenium for prostate cancer .
The study seemed promising , but in the end it showed no benefit from the supplements and a potentially higher risk for diabetes in selenium users .
“ My sentiment is that the lesson we have learned form large trials with other vitamin supplements , including Select , is that there is no proven health or preventative benefit for dietary supplements in nutritionally replete populations , which accounts for most of the people who enter this sort of clinical trial , ” Dr. Klein said .
“ It makes more sense to me to study dietary supplements or vitamins in populations who are deficient . ”
People most at risk for vitamin D deficiency are older , have diabetes or kidney disease , stay indoors or have darker skin .
African - American teenagers are at particularly high risk , possibly because in addition to their dark skin , they are less likely at that age to drink milk or play outside .
The scientific community continues to debate the optimum level of vitamin D . In general , people are considered to be deficient if they have blood levels below 15 or 20 nanograms per milliliter .
But many doctors now believe vitamin D levels should be above 30 .
The ideal level is n’t known , nor is it known at what point a person is getting too much vitamin D , which can lead to kidney stones , calcification in blood vessels and other problems .
People ’s vitamin D levels are influenced by whether they have light or dark skin , where they live , how much time they spend outdoors and by fish and milk consumption .
To raise vitamin D without supplements , a person could increase sun exposure for 10 to 15 minutes a day .
Eating more fish can help — a 3.5 - ounce serving of wild fresh salmon has 600 to 1,000 I.U. ’s of vitamin D — but it would take a quart of milk a day to get the recommended dose of vitamin D .
“ What we know is that there are a lot of people who are vitamin D deficient based on estimates from national surveys , ” said Dr. Michal L. Melamed , assistant professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx .
“ But we do n’t know what happens when the curve shifts to the other end .
There probably is a risk to having too much vitamin D in the system . ”
Linda Greenhouse on the Supreme Court and the law .
The real surprise of the Supreme Court ’s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , which magnified the ability of corporations to spend money in political campaigns , is how widely disliked the ruling is across the ideological spectrum .
After more than a month , the storm set off by the Citizens United ruling is still raging .
In one poll released this month , 56 percent of Republicans who voted for Republican candidates in 2008 said they opposed the decision , while only 33 percent favored it .
Another poll revealed that almost as many Republicans opposed to the ruling ( 76 percent ) as Democrats ( 85 percent . )
Fueling the Citizens United storm , it would appear , are the winds of populism .
And given the widespread public distaste for bailouts and bonuses , the court ’s timing was awkward , to say the least .
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the four others in the majority — Justices Anthony M. Kennedy , Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. — now look like the only friends that corporate America has left .
Just when conservatives have finally assembled a dream team of like - minded Supreme Court justices , the court has missed the Tea Party .
I ’ve been traveling a good deal during the past month , and everywhere I ’ve gone , people have expressed shock that the Supreme Court could have deemed corporations to be “ persons , ” entitled along with the rest of us to the First Amendment right to free speech .
Yet the concept of corporate personhood for certain constitutional purposes is not an invention of the Roberts court ; it dates to the 19th century .
And the Supreme Court has been giving increasingly robust protection to the rights of corporate and other commercial speakers for decades .
Seen in this light , Citizens United , which overturned a provision of the McCain - Feingold campaign finance law that curbed corporate spending on television advertising for or against identified candidates in the weeks leading up to an election , was not so much a sharp break with the past as the culmination of long - running trends .
No matter .
The decision , its visibility enhanced by President Obama ’s public rebuke of the court during the State of the Union speech last month , is obviously serving as a wake - up call , prompting many people to pay attention for the first time to those very trends .
Clearly , they do n’t like what they see .
One question is whether disaffection with a particular decision will translate into a more general disaffection with the court itself .
The last decision to provoke such a strongly negative public reaction was Kelo v. City of New London , the 2005 eminent domain decision that interpreted the Fifth Amendment ’s “ takings ” clause to permit governments to condemn private property and transfer it to other private owners — typically , corporations — for the purpose of economic development .
Polls indicated that 80 percent to 95 percent of the public , across every political and demographic group , opposed the decision .
Activists announced plans to take the New Hampshire farmhouse of Justice David H. Souter , who had voted with the 5 - to - 4 majority , and turn the property into the “ Lost Liberty Hotel , ” with a copy of Ayn Rand ’s “ Atlas Shrugged ” to be placed on the nightstand in every guest room .
Related Room for Debate : How Corporate Money Will Reshape Politics
Jan. 21 , 2010
That was a prank , of course .
But the populist tide was beginning to run , even back then .
Within months , proposals to curb the use of eminent domain were being considered in nearly every state legislature and within two years , 31 states had enacted anti-eminent domain legislation of varying degrees of effectiveness .
A major difference between the Kelo decision and Citizens United , of course , is that in the first case , the court was enabling elected legislatures to do what they wanted to do , leaving them free to continue with economic development policies or to stay their own hands .
In Citizens United , by contrast , it was the court that tied the legislature ’s hands , declaring an act of Congress unconstitutional and taking away a tool that had appeared to offer some hope of restraining the flood of money into politics .
That the provision had been only marginally effective , if that , in achieving that goal is less important than the narrative now growing up around Citizens United and rapidly taking on a life of its own , almost independent of what the court actually held .
Although undoubtedly spontaneous to some degree , the narrative is taking shape under careful cultivation .
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , under the heading of “ Citizens Before Corporations ” on its Web site , is asking supporters to sign a petition “ demanding that Republicans support legislation to reduce runaway corporate spending on elections . ”
The site is illustrated with a mock newspaper headline that reads , “ Court Rolls Back Decades of Reform : Dems Vow to Fight for Citizens ; G.O.P. Sides with Corporate Money . ”
At the time , I thought President Obama ’s lecture to the robed justices seated before him in the House chamber for the State of the Union speech was a miscue .
But in retrospect , it looks like a well - considered move to enable the administration to catch the populist wave and ride it , perhaps into the next Supreme Court vacancy and beyond .
Since the era of the Warren court and its revolutions on questions of race and of the rights of criminal defendants , Republicans have run effective campaigns against the Supreme Court , something Democrats have never managed to do .
That is because the court , centrist by institutional nature , has not given the Democrats much of a natural target ; when it ventured from the center , it usually strayed to the left , at least in high - profile cases involving social issues .
The Roberts court is arguably in the process of reversing that polarity , tacking to the right of public opinion ’s mainstream — but it had not yet tacked far enough to arouse much reaction .
Until now — a fascinating moment , with the drama playing out unexpectedly not along the usual left - right axis but rather as the people versus the elite .
At last week ’s Conservative Political Action Conference , Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota railed against “ the elites and the pundits ” who dismiss members of the Tea Party movement as “ bumpkins ” because “ a lot of them did n’t go to the Ivy League schools ” and are “ from places like the heartland . ”
Let ’s see : can anyone think of a group of nine people , four of whom hail from New York or New Jersey , two from California , and eight from the Ivy League ?
What difference does a great doctor make to your health ?
Patients everywhere would love to know the answer .
A recent study co-authored by Joseph Doyle , an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management , offers a subtle conclusion to this question .
Treatment by a highly rated physician does not necessarily change the outcome of a serious medical problem .
Instead , the best doctors typically offer an accurate diagnosis more quickly than moderately rated doctors , leading to hospital stays for patients that are 10 percent shorter and less expensive — an average that increases to 25 percent for certain medical specialties .
“ As a patient myself , I always hope to go to a prestigious hospital , but I wonder how much more of an advantage that is , ” says Doyle .
“ It turns out that if you do n’t have access to the most prestigious teams , the less prestigious ones will eventually make the same types of interventions , but it just takes them longer to get there , and it ’s more costly . ”
These findings figure to resonate at a time when the cost of health care is a major political preoccupation .
To reach this conclusion , Doyle — along with his colleagues Steven Ewer of the University of Wisconsin and Todd Wagner of Stanford University — examined roughly 70,000 treatment episodes involving 30,000 patients , spread over 13 years , at a Veterans Affairs hospital in a large city in the United States .
The hospital ’s practices naturally lent themselves to a comparison of doctor quality since the institution randomly assigned patients to two separate teams of physicians and residents , which had markedly different medical backgrounds .
One of these teams ( dubbed “ Program A ” by the researchers ) consisted of members trained at an elite U.S. medical school , which sometimes boasts the nation ’s highest average MCAT scores among its incoming students .
The other group ( “ Program B ” ) has members trained at a middle - ranked medical school .
Medical residents with Program A had medical board - certification scores that on average placed them in the top quarter of the national results , while the Program B doctors had scores placing them in the bottom fifth of U.S. residency programs .
( The researchers agreed to keep the identities of the VA hospital and medical schools anonymous . )
Money , not mortality
Despite these differences , in some ways the bottom - line results for patients were similar regardless of whether they were treated by doctors in Program A or Program B .
The mortality rates for the two programs were within a percentage point of each other , as measured over 30 days , one year and five years from the time each patient was treated .
“ I find that to be a feel - good result , ” Doyle says .
As Doyle , Ewer , and Wagner see it , the major difference between the teams involved the ease and confidence with which the more highly regarded doctors made their diagnoses .
The doctors in Program B , the ones from the lower - ranked medical school , ordered 8 percent more tests than their counterparts in Program A , and on average took 8 percent longer to request an initial test for a patient .
These differences were more pronounced within certain specialties .
For instance , the Program B doctors took 21 percent longer to order heart exams , 51 percent longer to request an angiography , and 32 percent longer to order a cardiac stress test , for patients with congestive heart failure .
Such delays have a direct impact on the overall cost of treatment , since they result in longer hospital stays for patients .
Moreover , laboratory expenditures were 13 percent higher or patients in program B .
The doctors in Program B also consulted with specialists more often , which can also prolong the duration of a hospital visit .
“ Sometimes people look at the use of specialists as waste or excessive cost , ” says Doyle .
“ But maybe these [ lesser - ranked ] physicians need specialists to achieve the same outcomes . ”
Other health - care economists find the study a useful look at a complex question .
“ I think this has been on the minds of people trying to fix health care :
What goes on in that black box inside the heads of doctors ? ” says Jonathan Skinner , an economist who teaches at both Dartmouth College and Dartmouth Medical School .
“ It speaks more broadly to why we see greater medical costs in some areas — it may be the difficulties physicians are having making a diagnosis . ”
Only so much room at the top
To be sure , there will always be differences among doctors ; in any group of physicians , some will have better training or be more highly regarded than others .
By quantifying the disparities among doctors , however , and linking them to particular practices , Doyle ’s work provides a yardstick for medical professionals who would like to reduce the gap between excellent and average doctors in absolute terms .
As Doyle notes , a basic caveat to the study is that it examines just one VA hospital ( the researchers are looking for others featuring the same arrangements ) .
Nonetheless , Skinner , for one , thinks the paper will have a significant impact among policymakers .
“ The larger point this speaks to in terms of policy is that measurement is really important in understanding what physicians do , ” he says .
“ If you take a bunch of physicians and train them , you cannot assume they will all do the same things .
It would be nice to have feedback mechanisms where doctors and residents could sit down and observe what is going on .
They might change what they do . ”
( CNN ) --
From time to time , Sasha Raven Gross can be seen teetering around a neighborhood drinking hole .
She flirts with strangers , talks gibberish and sometimes spins in circles for no apparent reason until she falls down .
In one hand is her liquid of choice -- watered - down orange juice in a sippy cup .
The 14 - month - old toddler is the sort of barfly who's at the center of a recurring and heated debate : Should parents be allowed to bring their babies and children to bars ?
It is a question in Brooklyn , New York , that 's fired up online arguments , prompted unofficial protests and made outsiders giggle .
And while the issue may not be exclusive to that area , it 's the stuff disputes are made of in what Sasha 's dad , Matt Gross , calls the kid-heavy " greater stroller zone " of Park Slope and its surrounding neighborhoods .
Single hipsters and others without ( and sometimes with ) kids complain about being asked to watch their language , to not smoke outdoors near strollers and to keep their drunk friends under control so as not to scare the little ones .
They do n't want to feel pressure to play peekaboo .
They want to cry over their beers , they say , without having an infant drown them out .
If anyone is spitting up , they want it to be them .
" I will get up on the subway for kids .
I will be tolerant of them kicking the back of my seat while seeing a G - rated movie .
But let me have my bars , " said Julieanne Smolinski , 26 , who feels guilty sucking down suds in front of staring 5 - year - olds .
The adults who bring their offspring to bars , she suggests , are " clinging to their youth . "
Parents , on the other hand , say that as long as they 're responsible and their kids behave , they deserve the right to grab a quick drink with friends .
And , they might add , in a place like New York -- where the cost of baby sitters can be prohibitive and tight living quarters can make hosting guests at home difficult -- they need places to hang out , too .
" As a stay - at - home dad , it can be kind of isolating .
Bars , as much as they 're places to drink , they 're places to socialize and meet people , " said Gross , 35 , a freelance writer , an editor for the blog DadWagon and the columnist behind the Frugal Traveler in The New York Times .
" I long for adult contact .
... I do n't want to be excluded from the adult world . "
But the divide remains wide in the blogosphere .
Around 150 readers weighed in recently when someone posted on the Brooklynian , a neighborhood blog , the simple query : " Which bars are child free ? "
One writer shared the tale of a drunk father standing at a bar while his beer sloshed on his stroller - strapped kid 's face .
Another poster announced a bar crawl in which " no crawlers " would be allowed .
The public debate about babies in bars ignited about two years ago when the bar Union Hall , a popular stomping ground , banned strollers from the premises , Gross said .
" At a certain point , owners said , ' Hey , enough , ' " he explained .
" Strollers take up a lot of room , especially the nice strollers .
Your average Bugaboo is a beast . "
This ban on buggies in a neighborhood where " kids rule " caused an " uproar , " said Erica Reitman , the 36 - year - old married -- but not a " breeder , " she insists -- marketing director who is behind the blog F*** *ed in Park Slope .
" There was n't a march on the street , but there could have been .
[ Union Hall ] relented under pressure and got rid of the policy . "
The owner of Union Hall would not talk to CNN , but an unnamed bartender -- who mentioned the bar had been issued tickets by the fire department at one point because strollers blocked exits -- confirmed that there is no such policy in place .
In a part of the city where Greg Curley says he sees " a sense of entitlement on both sides , " and where people do n't hold back their opinions -- " This is Brooklyn , " he said -- he and his partners at The Double Windsor instituted a no - kids - after - 5 p.m. rule .
" We 're a neighborhood gathering place , not a hard - drinking bar , and we 're not jerks about it " said Curley , a co-owner and the general manager .
" But the overwhelming clientele that spends quite a lot of money here can't deal with babies . "
Rules like this , simple compromises , do n't bother Gross as they might other parents .
He 's not interested in taking Sasha out till all hours of the night anyway .
But when he gets a little stir-crazy in their apartment , he likes to head out to grab a stout with his little girl .
He 's not taking her to punk dive bars where the music is loud , fights break out and patrons make out or pass out .
They gravitate to mellow hangouts , and only in the late afternoon or early evening .
" I 'm not going to keep her out past 7 p.m .
When the bar starts filling up , that 's when we head home , " he said .
" It 's responsible parenting and responsible adult behavior .
I 'm not knocking back double vodkas while my daughter is stumbling around . "
The economic crisis shaking much of Europe , most extremely in nations like Greece , Spain , Italy and Portugal , has been variously blamed on the global financial meltdown , the flawed design of the European Union , and even ( predictably ) on shenanigans on Wall Street which helped some EU member nations circumvent lending limits .
But something deeper and more fundamental is at work which the global credit crisis has merely helped to expose .
Most European countries today operate under economic and labor policies crafted during the height of the post - war baby boom , featuring middle - class entitlements like generous pension systems that allow early retirement , liberal disability programs that exempt many laborers from work , and extended unemployment systems that make going on the dole and staying there easier than in the U.S. Europeans designed these policies in an era when there were , in many European minds , too many people competing for jobs and a bulging work population to support those who were retired or on disability .
Today , however , the demographics of most European countries are radically different .
Their working age populations are shrinking , while their retiree cohort swells , placing a severe strain on government budgets and crowding out other spending .
High taxes go to support this entitlement regime , and those who work are discouraged by such taxes to work harder , making it all the more difficult for countries to achieve the productivity gains that they so desperately need .
Europe requires a very different series of policies now which encourage people to stay employed longer , which make it harder to exit the workforce on the government dole , and which allow labor markets to be more flexible .
Economists and demographers have been warning of this for years .
Indeed , back in 2002 the demographer Paul Hewitt predicted a steep worldwide recession exacerbated by population changes " from which no welfare state will emerge intact . "
Still , winning the kinds of reforms that Europe needs is no easy task because government finds it very hard to take back the perks , once bestowed , that many Europeans now enjoy .
Greece is a good example of a country whose labor laws and social policies are at odds with its population trends .
Yes , a series of Greek governments have been profligate , running up debt and financing the welfare state with long - term borrowing .
But they 've been doing this precisely because they are trying to swim against long - term demographic trends that are inexorable .
Greece has one of the lowest fertility rates of any country in Europe , just 1.3 children per woman , nearly a full child below what 's considered replacement rate .
Moreover , this rate has been falling for decades , so that Greece 's 65 - and - over population has soared from just 11 percent of the country in 1970 to 24 percent today , and is projected to grow to one - third of the population by 2050 .
By contrast , Greece 's working age population ( defined as those ages 15 - to - 64 ) has reached its peak and is projected to decline 20 percent over the next 40 years .
Given these demographics , Greece has exactly the wrong labor and retirement policies in place .
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , Greece has among the most liberal pension systems , with generous payouts to encourage workers to retire early , including whole categories of workers in jobs deemed " arduous . "
Incentives matter , of course , so that even while Greece needs to be encouraging more of its citizens to work longer , they are doing the opposite : Only 42 percent of Greece 's population aged 55 - to - 65 are employed , compared to 52 percent of the OECD on average and 62 percent in the United States .
Greece suffers not only from the lost national productivity of a shrinking workforce , but from the cost of high retirement payouts .
Greece spends nearly 12 percent of its gross domestic product on pensions - compared to 6 percent in the United States .
To support that burden Greece has among the highest rate of taxes on the average worker in Europe , 42 percent of income earned , compared to 37 percent in the OECD on average and 30 percent in the United States .
No wonder so many Greek workers find it more profitable to retire or to evade taxes , another of Greece 's problems .
Europe 's other most troubled countries share many of Greece 's characteristics .
Italy and Spain have birth rates that have slipped as low as Greece 's and shrinking labor working age populations .
Yet early retirement is the norm .
In Italy the average retirement age is 59 , among the lowest in industrialized nations , and Spain is ranked only slightly higher .
Only one - third of Italy 's population aged 55 - to - 64 is in the workforce , and the average male worker in Italy will spend more than 25 years in retirement .
In fact , with life expectancy increasing , a growing chunk of European adults spend more of their [ adult ] life retired than working .
But the costs are staggering .
Italy now spends 15 percent of its GDP on pensions , the highest in the Europe .
Many Americans tend to associate the term " welfare state " with a regime of anti-poverty programs reminiscent of the Johnson administration 's War on Poverty .
But in Europe the welfare state generally refers to an extensive array of entitlements enjoyed by middle and upper - middle income citizens .
That 's one reason why efforts to reform ( that is , reduce ) these entitlements have met with so much resistance in Europe .
Even in staid Austria workers have taken to the streets to protest changes in the country 's pension system .
Still , change is coming because the traditional European welfare state is an anachronism that 's unsustainable .
Already countries like Sweden , Austria and Germany have made alterations to their pension systems , including Sweden 's efforts to follow the Chilean model with a partial privatization of social security .
Change is coming to the United States , too .
Although we are demographically robust compared to Europe ( our working age population will increase by a projected 17 percent over the next 40 years ) and we work longer , our own baby boom was so large that we 'll still need substantial changes in Medicare and Social Security to meet our future obligations .
Meanwhile , our states face a tough road because many of them have granted European - like retirement benefits to government workers that are exacerbating state budget problems .
Our road to reform should n't be as painful as what the Europeans face , except that rolling back benefits is often so difficult that action is only possible in a crisis .
That may be the real message of the growing mess in Europe : getting back what government has already granted is so politically tough that it 's best to proceed cautiously with new entitlements .
Here ’s a sensible note from a young Navy submarine officer who says he is writing because he wants people to understand that the obstacle to being openly gay in the military lies in Congress , not in the uniformed military :
The debate may exist in the media , and certainly exists in Congress , but on the ship , if it ’s talked about at all it with a little bit of confusion about what the big deal is .
Do n’t get me wrong , there is homophobia and there are a few loud , mostly uneducated , mostly very junior , and mostly still well - meaning people who would tell you they think its wrong — but they ’re the kind of people who are just saying it because its what they were brought up to say , and even they are n’t saying it with much fervor .
I can tell you with certainty that if the ban were lifted tomorrow — no year of preparation — life would go on exactly as it did before … .
Life would go on .
Mostly what I heard after Admiral Mullen ’s declaration was , " it ’s about time . "
There is no question if the military is ready — the military is waiting .
… I just want the press to understand that it is the Congress that needs pushing , not the military , and that excuses such as " senior military officials like the CJCS and SecDef are out of touch with the low - level , young guys on the ground " may be true on many issues , but not this one .
Snowstorm Recovery Reveals Truth About Socialism
There is a silver lining to every snowstorm — getting to know your neighbors both good and bad .
With forty inches on my block this week , I ’ve learned a lot about my neighbors and , strangely enough , socialism .
My corner of Baltimore seems like a good place to ride out a storm .
After all , innumerable cars are plastered with Obama bumper stickers , and windows display signs like “ Universal Healthcare Now . ”
In essence , it ’s a very liberal neighborhood in an extremely liberal state .
What better neighborhood to be in times of need , right ?
The architecture ranges from early 19th to early 20th century row homes , which as a result demands parallel parking .
This is n’t a great inconvenience most of the time , but with the snow , it ’s an absolute nightmare .
First the clouds drop forty inches .
Then the city snow plow piles another mountain from the street onto your car .
Successfully liberating the vehicle from its icy prison can take hours .
After leaving the spot , anyone can take the laboriously freed space .
Restoring regular parking conditions quickly requires everyone chipping in for the common good .
During this street clearing process , my neighbors sorted themselves into four groups :
1. The Saint ( 1 % of the neighborhood ) —
Every couple of blocks resides a truly amazing human being living to serve others .
He ’s shoveling out his neighbors ’ cars , dumping bags of rock salt down the whole street , and passing out shovels like he owns a hardware store .
2. The Good Citizen ( 15 % of the neighborhood ) —
A caring person does n’t just shovel enough snow to drive away .
He carves out the front and back .
After leaving his spot , someone else can parallel park without digging .
If everyone did this , normal parking would resume in a day — if not less .
3 . The Self - Interested Person ( 70 % of the neighborhood ) —
This guy does n’t really care about helping anyone .
He carves just enough in the front to get out .
The next person must dig before parking .
4 . The Malicious Creep ( 14 % of the neighborhood ) —
Instead of shoveling snow to the curb , the creep stacks snow onto his neighbor ’s car .
This saves the creep approximately fifteen minutes while adding an hour to his neighbor ’s work .
While my neighbors love Obama and universal healthcare , they obviously are n’t such good socialists on their own block .
This is no surprise ; everyone on earth is an armchair Mother Theresa .
We all have noble thoughts at the coffee shop or over beers .
But when the snow shovel has to come out , so does the truth .
So let ’s face it .
Universal healthcare supporters are much like the folks on my street .
There are a couple of saints , a few good people , and a large chunk who are either self - interested or just plain selfish .
Most support it either because they will benefit directly , or they think the tax burden will not be placed on them .
According to a recent Gallup poll only 34 percent believe that healthcare reform will personally increase their costs .
Gallup also points out that most do n’t think healthcare reform will benefit them personally — hence they are supposedly altruistic .
But it ’s not altruism when only 34 percent believe that they will do the shoveling .
You do n’t think this is true ?
Just look at the Republican Party ’s anti-universal healthcare campaign .
The GOP has n’t appealed to morality or fairness , but instead to selfish elements among universal healthcare supporters .
The message is that the plan will cost more for everyone and your healthcare will get worse .
So far the campaign has worked .
One can speak sweet nothings while pleasantly sitting around a warm fireplace .
But in the end , a snowy day and a shovel will always reveal the selfish nature of a socialist underneath .

And tidings of comfort and joy from Harry Reid too .
The Senate Majority Leader has decided that the last few days before Christmas are the opportune moment for a narrow majority of Democrats to stuff ObamaCare through the Senate to meet an arbitrary White House deadline .
Barring some extraordinary reversal , it now seems as if they have the 60 votes they need to jump off this cliff , with one - seventh of the economy in tow .
Mr. Obama promised a new era of transparent good government , yet on Saturday morning Mr. Reid threw out the 2,100 - page bill that the world 's greatest deliberative body spent just 17 days debating and replaced it with a new " manager 's amendment " that was stapled together in covert partisan negotiations .
Democrats are barely even bothering to pretend to care what 's in it , not that any Senator had the chance to digest it in the 38 hours before the first cloture vote at 1 a .m. this morning .
After procedural motions that allow for no amendments , the final vote could come at 9 p.m. on December 24 .
Even in World War I there was a Christmas truce .
The rushed , secretive way that a bill this destructive and unpopular is being forced on the country shows that " reform " has devolved into the raw exercise of political power for the single purpose of permanently expanding the American entitlement state .
An increasing roll of leaders in health care and business are looking on aghast at a bill that is so large and convoluted that no one can truly understand it , as Finance Chairman Max Baucus admitted on the floor last week .
The only goal is to ram it into law while the political window is still open , and clean up the mess later .
***
• Health costs .
From the outset , the White House 's core claim was that reform would reduce health costs for individuals and businesses , and they 're sticking to that story .
" Anyone who says otherwise simply has n't read the bills , " Mr. Obama said over the weekend .
This is so utterly disingenuous that we doubt the President really believes it .

Introduction
Sometimes I catch myself thinking the same silly thought - " why are n't these guys as big as the Beatles ? "
Then I catch myself giving myself the same silly answer : " Well , you know , after all , when the Beatles came out to greet the world , they greeted it with ' Well she was just seventeen - you know what I mean ' .
But when Ween came out to greet it , all these stupid nitwits could offer it was ' You fucked up !
You bitch - you really fucked up ! ' "
What other reasons would you need , then ? "
General Evaluation : Listenability : 4/5 .
Ween have written more unforgettable melodies than almost everyone in my recent memory , but one point off for occasional murkiness .
Resonance : 3/5 . 5/5 would be pushing it - but see above on Ween 's relations with The Emotional in music .
Originality : 2/5 .
Not so much in the actual songs as in the very concept and history of the band ( although lots of minor touches are pretty original ) .
Adequacy : 5/5 .
You need to be ambitious to be inadequate , and large , serious ambitions are certainly not a thing I would ever suspect these guys of .
Diversity : 5+/5 .
No comment here .
Just go listen to the records , dammit !
Overall : 3.8 = B on the rating scale .

In 1990 , grunge was n't around .
Not much of it , at least .
The world was still dominated by green dragons and frizzed hair .
Those with better tastes stayed ( relatively ) underground and only gave themselves away by not having their hair frizzed .
Into this fucked - up world came Ween , and by fucking it up some more , managed to cure some of its problems .

THE POD
Year Of Release : 1991
9
Overall rating =
One thing 's for certain - you do n't wanna mess around with the Boognish .
There 's some real scary shit on here .
Track listing : 1 ) Strap On That Jammy Pac ; 2 ) Dr Rock ; 3 ) Frank ; 4 ) Sorry Charlie ; 5 ) The Stallion ( part 1 ) ; 6 ) Pollo Asado ; 7 ) Right To The Ways And The Rules Of The World ; 8 ) Captain Fantasy ; 9 ) Demon Sweat ; 10 ) Molly ; 11 ) Can U Taste The Waste ; 12 ) Do n't Sweat It ; 13 ) Awesome Sound ; 14 ) Laura ; 15 ) Boing ; 16 ) Mononucleosis ; 17 ) Oh My Dear ( Falling In Love ) ; 18 ) Sketches Of Winkle ; 19 ) Alone ; 20 ) Moving Away ; 21 ) She F***s Me ; 22 ) Pork Roll Egg And Cheese ; 23 ) The Stallion ( part 3 ) .
Where Ween and Zappa really connect with each other is their reluctance to make completely self - sufficient records .
Thus ,
The Pod is not so much an independent collection of songs as it is the logical ( or , rather , illogical - with Ween , you do n't always know where one ends and the other begins ) continuation of GWS which , in its turn , then flows straight into the basin of Pure Guava , and so on .
There 's always the Boognish , and there 's always Gener and Deener as his faithful prophets , and there 's the swearing and profanity , and there are whores and stallions and funny accents and fuzz effects and guava and ever so often , you 'll come across pork roll , eggs and cheese .
You know you 'll get it all , or much of it at least .

PURE GUAVA
Year Of Release : 1992

Overall rating =
Perfunctory .
But when it 's applied to Ween , you can never be sure about the meaning of that particular word .
Track listing : 1 ) Little Birdy ; 2 ) Tender Situation ; 3 ) The Stallion Pt. 3 ; 4 ) Big Jilm ; 5 ) Push Th' Little Daisies ; 6 ) The Goin ' Gets Tough From The Getgo ; 7 ) Reggaejunkiejew ;
8 ) I Play It Off Legit ; 9 ) Pumpin ' 4 The Man ; 10 ) Sarah ; 11 ) Springtheme ; 12 ) Flies On My Dick ; 13 ) I Saw Gener Cryin' In His Sleep ; 14 ) Touch My Tooter ; 15 ) Mourning Glory ; 16 ) Loving U Thru It All ; 17 ) Hey Fat Boy ( Asshole ) ; 18 ) Do n't Get 2 Close ( To My Fantasy ) ; 19 ) Poop Ship Destroyer .
I do n't have any documental proof , and wo n't get any unless I apply for the position of Ween 's Official Biographer ( and since such a position probably requires the applicant to have close encounters with Scotchguard , I guess it 's tough luck for me ) .
But I still feel positively sure , from the pork roll in my head to the eggs and cheese in my toes , that the reason why Pure Guava sounds the way it sounds had something - a lot , in fact - to do with Ween being picked up by Elektra Records .
Now the reason they got picked up completely escapes me ; maybe somebody saw that one of their songs was called ' Can U Taste The Waste ' and thought they were the next Doors or something .
( Yes , some people can be that stupid , otherwise , why would bands like Ween exist in the first place ? ) .

CHOCOLATE AND CHEESE
Year Of Release : 1994

Overall rating =
Looks like variety is no longer the spice of life - it 's its chocolate and cheese .
Track listing : 1 ) Take Me Away ; 2 ) Spinal Meningitis ( Got Me Down ) ; 3 ) Freedom Of ' 76 ; 4 ) I Can't Put My Finger On It ; 5 ) A Tear For Eddie ; 6 ) Roses Are Free ; 7 ) Baby Bitch ; 8 ) Mister Would You Please Help My Pony ; 9 ) Drifter In The Dark ; 10 ) Voodoo Lady ; 11 ) Joppa Road ; 12 ) Candi ; 13 ) Buenas Tardes Amigo ; 14 ) The HIV Song ; 15 ) What Deaner Was Talkin ' About ; 16 ) Do n't Shit Where You Eat .
Finally transferred to a brand new studio where they can mess up some brand new equipment , the Weeners finally get back to what they used to do best of all - that is , everything at once .
Somewhere out there , I see potential battles on the horizon , fought over the issue of what 's more diverse - Chocolate And Cheese or GodWeenSatan .
Well , running ahead on nothing but pure intuition , I 'd say that in pure technical terms , the latter covers more styles , but the big difference between the two is that for C&C , Ween have consciously undergone a crash course in maturation .
That 's not to say they have gotten " traditionally serious " , or that they dropped the dick jokes .
That 's to say they are crafting actual songs now - songs that can stand on their individual own .
As cool as something like ' Can You Taste The Waste ' ever was , it only really stood on its two legs in the general context of The Pod .
Furthermore , you could never mistake it for ' the real thing ' - the tongue was so firmly in cheek you'd be spotting the fleshy bulge a mile away .

12 GOLDEN COUNTRY GREATS
Year Of Release : 1996
8
Overall rating =
The rating kinda matches the title , but may also be as deceptive as the title .
Reader beware .
Track listing : 1 ) I 'm Holding You ; 2 ) Japanese Cowboy ; 3 ) Piss Up A Rope ; 4 ) I Don't Wanna Leave You On The Farm ; 5 ) Pretty Girl ; 6 ) Powder Blue ; 7 ) Mister Richard Smoker ; 8 ) Help Me Scrape The Mucus Off My Brain ; 9 ) You Were The Fool ; 10 ) Fluffy .
If somebody came up to me in mid-1996 and asked , 'if Ween were to select just one musical genre for an entire album , what genre would that be ? ' , I would n't know what to answer because I 'd never heard any Ween at the time .
( Which is a good thing - in 1996 , I would probably have hated the band 's guts and then some ) .
If somebody came up to me today and asked the same question without my knowing the answer , though , I 'd probably say something like " Melanesian polka with mushrooms " ...

THE MOLLUSK
Year Of Release : 1997
10
Overall rating =
As deep and , uh , green as the front cover suggests .
Track listing : 1 ) I 'm Dancing In The Show Tonite ; 2 ) The Mollusk ; 3 ) Polka Dot Tail ; 4 ) I'll Be Your Johnny On The Spot ; 5 ) Mutilated Lips ; 6 ) The Blarney Stone ; 7 ) It 's Gonna Be ( Alright ) ; 8 ) The Golden Eel ; 9 ) Cold Blows The Wind ; 10 ) Pink Eye ( On My Leg ) ; 11 ) Waving My Dick In The Wind ; 12 ) Buckingham Green ; 13 ) Ocean Man ; 14 ) She Wanted To Leave ( Reprise ) .
So , affter the country detour ( a fabulous one , but a detour nonetheless ) , it 's time to get back to business .
The Mollusk is frequently described as the brothers ' " prog rock album " , but this can give a slightly false perspective on the scope of Ween 's sixth studio record , especially if you 're like me and have a narrow understanding of prog rock as the kind of classically ( or , at the least , jazzily ) influenced music played by the likes of ELP , Yes , and Genesis .
Not that there are n't any direct references to that kind of sonic wizardry on The Mollusk - there 's much - but were this merely a concentrated parody on prog rock masters , there 's no way I could call this the band 's ultimate masterpiece .

Maybe " Grow Old With Me " might have been a better title , but I am growing older and it suits me just fine .

God I thought I was the only one but looks like the Pitchforkmedia reviewer guy beat me to it .
But what the heck , I did think of it meself , so here goes : if the title of this album is n't anything other than an obvious superimposition of the names of two of the greatest albums ever recorded , I still wo n't believe in it , because there are coincidences and then there are impossible coincidences .

It seems that the Secret Of Monkey Island Special Edition must have been enough of a success for LucasArts to pursue the idea further .
It ’s been announced that the sequel is receiving the same treatment , now called Monkey Island 2 Special Edition : Le Chuck ’s Revenge .
And it ’s arriving in the Summer .
There ’s no video of the game yet , but screenshots are about .
Once again the game has been completely overhauled , while still technically running identically in the background .
You can switch back and forth between the original and new versions any time .
However , whether they will have addressed any of the really rather enormous issues with the first remake is not yet known .
It was problematic that the special edition managed to make the game so much more awkward to use , a ghastly inventory and muddle of inputs that made it often far easier to just switch back to the original mode and play with that .
Cycling through nine different interacting options that – bewilderingly – did n’t appear in the same order each time , was inexplicable .
Even using the verb pop -up box still required multiple key presses and mouse clicks , cycling through options , and tearing at hair , taking a big backward step from the two - decade - old original clumsy interface .
Since the game ’s in super - widescreen anyway , this time I really strongly hope they have the top and bottom of the screen be mouse - over pop -up menus for the inventory and the verbs , to make a slick , simple way of playing with minimal fuss .
However , there ’s news that there ’s to be a new control mechanism , with Guybrush available to be directly controlled .
This will be optional , for purists .
And they ’ve reworked his hair , which , oh heavens , it was weird enough that everyone complained about that the first time .
The remake looked lovely , the music was great , and the voice work was absolutely wonderful .
Clearly they poured a lot of love into it .
But there ’s certainly room for Revenge to be a lot better , and I ’m very hopeful it will be .
So long as LucasArts did n’t only read the really worrying number of reviewers who appeared to be wistfully writing about their memories of playing it twenty years ago .
Now everyone argue about whether Secret or Revenge was better .
Go !
What do you think is going to happen ???
[ An ] act of terrorism means any activity that ( A ) involves a violent act or an act dangerous to human life that is a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any State , or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State ; and ( B ) appears to be intended ( i ) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ; ( ii ) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion ; or ( iii ) to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping .
In the evening of March 4 , as U.S. Department of Defense workers were wrapping up their day , a man wearing a suit and displaying what guards later referred to as a " nervous intensity " approached the entrance to the Pentagon .
As he walked up to the guard booth , he reached into his pocket and took out a semi-automatic 9 mm pistol and began firing at the two security personnel stationed at the entrance .
The guards retreated behind ballistic glass and returned fire at the man , who rushed the entrance .
Seconds later , a third guard armed with a .40 - caliber submachine gun confronted and shot the gunman , delivering a fatal head wound that ended the incident .
The gunman in this case was John Patrick Bedell , a native Californian who had driven from California to Washington to carry out his one - man attack on the Pentagon .
Given the available details ( e.g. , a cross- country trek , business attire ) , it appears that Bedell had planned his attack well ahead of time .
He had a history of mental illness as well as minor criminal offenses , such as growing marijuana and resisting arrest .
More notable , though , is a series of recordings and writings he posted on the Internet in November 2006 in which he criticized the federal government and said the 9/11 attacks were a government - led conspiracy .
The March 4 shooting came right on the heels of another attack against the U.S. government , this one in Austin , Texas , where software engineer and pilot Joseph Stack crashed his single - engine Piper Cherokee into a building Feb. 18 that housed offices of the Internal Revenue Service .
In another previous attack , Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan , a U.S. Army psychiatrist , opened fire at a troop processing facility at Fort Hood , Texas , killing 13 people .
While many government officials are denying that these incidents were terrorist acts , we at STRATFOR disagree .
Arguments used to not classify these attacks as terrorism include the failure to generate large numbers of casualties , a lack of foreign ties and the absence of a larger conspiracy .
This dismissal of terrorism as a factor in these attacks ultimately has a long - term impact on past and future investigations , and it also seems to ignore the legal definition , as set out in Title VIII , Section 802 of the USA PATRIOT Act :
It is important to note that this definition does not include the magnitude of the violence involved in the attack — it does not have to be a catastrophic event .
The word " terrorism " has taken on a lot of inflated connotations as Islamist militant groups , among others , have used it as a tactic to cause high ( often civilian ) casualty rates in complex , well - orchestrated attacks .
Attacks like 9/11 , the 2004 Madrid train bombings , the 2005 London bombings and the 2008 Mumbai siege were all catastrophic in terms of physical damage and loss of human life .
But they also became massive media events that ensured that the Islamist extremists behind the attacks remained in the spotlight for months , if not years — an effective way to publicize their ideology and objectives .
But attacks do not have to be huge and catastrophic to be considered acts of terror .
Consider the statement from the October 2009 Echo of Battle ( 11th edition ) , in which al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader Nasir al - Wahayshi advocated using simple attacks against a variety of targets .
It was significant that al - Wahayshi said this , but it was certainly not a novel idea .
Numerous attacks previously considered acts of terrorism had been committed following this small - scale model : Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad opened fire on a U.S. Army / Navy career center in Little Rock , Ark. , on June 1 , 2009 , killing one soldier and critically wounding another .
The attack was considered an act of terrorism because Muhammad was protesting the presence of U.S. forces in Islamic countries .
An even earlier example is the case of Hesham Mohamed Hadayet , an Egyptian who opened fire on the El Al Airlines ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport in 2002 , killing two people before being killed himself .
His shooting was ruled an act of terrorism because investigators concluded that he was striking out at Israel on behalf of Palestinians .
Looking back over the last 100 years or so of terrorist attacks in the United States , there are many examples of small , non-catastrophic events .
Often these events are no more violent or consequential than a common criminal incident — what sets them apart are the political motivations of their perpetrators .
Indeed , catastrophic attacks are the exception to the rule , though the memory of these spectacular incidents is burned indelibly into the public mind .
Terrorist attacks also do not need to have foreign links .
Again , the dominant trend over the past decade has been that such attacks are linked to radical Islamist groups based in the Middle East and South Asia .
But terrorism does not belong to any set ideology or group .
It is a tactic , one that can be used by anyone to pursue any political goal .
In fact , looking back over the history of terrorism in the United States , most attacks have been generated and carried out by domestic groups .
Militant entities like the Order of the Covenant ( a white supremacist group ) , the Black Liberation Army , the Earth Liberation Front , anarchist groups and anti-abortion groups have more often than not been the perpetrators behind terrorist attacks on U.S. soil .
Foreign - based terrorism in the United States is fairly rare , and the most recent extremist Islamist attacks have been " home grown , " with the ideology and perhaps inspiration coming from abroad but with the actual materials being collected and the preparation conducted in the United States .
Finally , in order to be considered terrorism , an attack does not have to be part of a larger conspiracy — it can be carried out by a single individual .
The lone - wolf attack is actually the most dangerous because it is not part of a larger conspiracy , which can make a plot more vulnerable to discovery .
Often a single individual will carry out a terrorist attack based on a political ideology shared by a larger group , which can blur the lines of what constitutes a lone - wolf attack .
Incidents like the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing are consistent with this type of attack .
Theodore Kaczynski ( aka the " Unabomber " ) is the archetypal lone - wolf operative who used violent attacks to publicize a social and political message .
Therefore his violent acts qualify as terrorism .
When thinking about Bedell , Stack and Hasan , it is important to view their actions in the context of the longer history of terrorism , not just over the past decade .
The attacks these individuals carried out appear to match the conditions specified in the USA PATRIOT
Act in that they were violent and appear to be politically motivated .
All three perpetrators had exhibited overt disapproval of U.S. government policies in writings and communications prior to their attacks .
While this is n't enough to prove that the attacks were politically motivated , it certainly provides a reason for further investigation .
Instead , authorities have dismissed these cases as criminal acts due to the lack of foreign involvement or outside help .
In the Hasan case ( which would be the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11 ) , the FBI has ceded investigation of the case to the Defense Criminal Investigative Service ( DCIS ) , the Department of Defense 's internal investigative unit .
Certainly , the DCIS has jurisdiction over the case because it took place on a military base , but considering that the FBI 's current top priority is protecting the United States from terrorist attacks , its low profile in this case seems to run counter to that mission .
As a criminal case , Hasan 's attack is pretty straightforward .
It can be easily proved that he shot and killed the 13 people , and this is exactly what the DCIS will do because that is its job .
An FBI counterterrorism investigation , however , would provide a more in - depth look at other connections that Hasan may have had that could shed light on other militant activities .
For example , what is the significance of reports of Hasan 's correspondence with Anwar al - Awlaki , a U.S. - born imam who is currently living in Yemen recruiting operatives for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and who is also believed to have ties to Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ?
Without conducting a terrorism investigation into his activities , questions like these may go unanswered .
The denial of terrorist links in such cases is similar to denials surrounding the 1990 assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York by El Sayyid Nosair , an Egyptian with U.S. citizenship .
Initially , the FBI denied that the case was terrorism and Nosair was acquitted of the murder charges brought against him .
Following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , the FBI re-labeled the Kahane assassination an act of terrorism and re-charged Nosair after it learned of his relationship to Omar Abdul - Rahman and of his involvement in the World Trade Center attack .
Had authorities pursued the terrorism angle following Kahane 's assassination , perhaps more information would have been known about the individuals plotting the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
But getting the FBI involved in cases like those of Hasan , Stack or Bedell sends the clear signal that the federal government suspects terrorism , and sending that signal is politically inexpedient right now .
Suggesting that an act is terrorism automatically draws more attention to the incident , causing more fear among the population and giving the actors and their political messages more publicity .
Moreover , the political sensitivity surrounding the investigation of Muslims ( especially those serving in the U.S. military ) means that avoiding the issue is politically less risky .
The FBI was given the responsibility of preventing terrorism because it was one of the only existing agencies after 9/11 that had the resources and manpower to address it .
However , the FBI has a stronger background in , and institutional culture based on , investigating criminal cases ( especially organized crime ) and traditionally has not been focused on counterterrorism .
Moreover , given the boom - and - bust cycle in funding counterterrorism operations , those involved in the field do n't view it as being necessarily good for their national security careers .
According to the definition of terrorism laid out in the USA PATRIOT Act , the cases of Hasan and Stack clearly fit the label of terrorism and Bedell 's is certainly looking that way .
But not examining the possibility of terrorism in the first place risks overlooking important pieces of information that could prove useful in preventing the next attack , or fully understanding the last one .

Chinese users are being redirected to the google .
com.hk site China has condemned Google 's decision to redirect users to an uncensored site in Hong Kong - effectively closing its search site in China .
Most BBC
News website readers in China appear to be critical of the decision and suggest its impact on internet users in China will be limited .
THE IMPACT ON INTERNET USERS I feel regret Google 's leaving .
For most Chinese , Google is the only access to real information abroad .
Most Chinese college students need academic information and Google is their only choice .
Compared with the biggest competitor , Baidu , which is full of advertisements and fake information , Google has done well .
Maybe Google is a loser in business but a winner in ethics .
Dante , Ningbo , China
When I search Chinese content , I always use Baidu because it gives me more suitable results .
But when I want some international material , for example on software development , Google gives me the results I want .
The most important is that I almost never use Google.cn .
So if Google .cn does n't exist , it 's not big deal to me .
I just use Google.com .
I think that the government censorship is not good , there must be another way to keep our society harmonious .
Chen Daojun , Sichuan Province
It is amazing that Google has made this decision and that they are prepared to lose the most valuable market .
Most Chinese people are regretting this , however , it will not have a great impact on our lives .
Chaos , China I feel very sad about Google 's withdraw .
It means that I will not be able to find information effectively and it could cost me more time to find information for my work , because most of the Chinese search engines are not very effective due to government control .
Google 's decision and the government 's response will be a big hindrance to Chinese internet development .
Guan Lei , China Google 's withdrawal from the Chinese market will affect China 's international image and many people wo n't be able to access information on Google .
Google will lose a potential market .
I would like to access Google and other sites like YouTube and Facebook .
Wesley , Qinghai , China
Most of my friends and colleagues use Baidu , not Google , because Baidu is advanced in Chinese searching .
Google have a tiny market share in China .
No market share - no profit .
Censorship is just an excuse to withdraw .
I 've always supported their products , like Gmail and Gtalk , but I 've no regrets to see them go .
Boxbo , Beijing
The earth still rotates without Google .
Actually the only drawback is that I would find it much more difficult to search porn websites after Google goes .
Camby Wang , Beijing SUPPORTING GOOGLE'S DECISION
I think it is good news for everyone who lives in China .
The Chinese government limits us a lot .
We can't watch videos on YouTube and we can't access Facebook .
There 's a joke , a play of words with the pronunciation of " facebook " in Chinese , which says " no choice but die " .
This is the destiny of Facebook in China .
Now Google redirects its users to its Hong Kong site - in my opinion this is good news for the Chinese people because it shows a stance against restrictions .
RyanZheng , Nanjing China
I strongly opposite the Chinese government 's activities and I will always use Google , any time , anywhere , even when the government is blocking access to its services .
Google , you are great !
Wangge , Wuhan CRITICAL OF THE MOVE
To be honest , I like Google , but I strongly oppose this decision .
It threatened the Chinese government with withdrawal from the country , now it does something different - it changes it 's server address .
I also strongly oppose the politicisation of commercial issues , and the link Google has with the US government .
I also strongly oppose Google putting pressure on China , so do n't just change your server - leave China completely .
Xiaoyong , Jinan , Shandong Province
It is a little regretful , but fortunately we still have Baidu and other search engines .
Abiding by the law is a very basic rule , not unique in China .
When Chinese companies go to do business in the US , can they say they do not like the US law ?
They have no choice but to respect the law .
Law is law .
Google is acting more aggressively than the US government , are they a company or a US agent , or a company with super - power , like in an American movie ?
We do not want to be controlled by a company .
Google leave China !
Yingda , Beijing Google is just a tool for the US government .
Business is business and a company should consider the benefit of its shareholders .
Anyway , what would Google have done if it occupied 80 % of the Chinese market .
Farewell Google , you will be back someday , but it will be tougher for you .
Junhua , China
Whether it's the US regulating internet gaming or Germany banning Nazism - related information on the internet , every country has its regulatory framework on the internet , which must be respected .
Google agreed to specific terms when entering China and now it changed its mind ?
Redirecting traffic to Hong Kong is even more outrageous as it openly tries to push for the circumvention of laws and regulations that my portfolio companies dutifully abide by .
I do n't think Google can come back to China any time soon .
Liu Yang Sheng , Beijing As a Chinese citizen I condemn Google 's action .
Google does n't have the right to intervene in our country 's domestic affairs .
I will never use Google anymore as a punishment .
Arthur Lyun , Penglai Google 's action is wrong .
It is a terrible example of the US making laws for the rest of the world .
A US company makes law for their own benefit but in the name of people .
xxxyyy329 , Shanghai , china FOREIGN PERSPECTIVE
I use Google Images all day for design research and the ban filters virtually all images , even through Hong Kong Google .
Baidu is not offered in English so this has hugely affected my work .
Very frustrating .
Owen Francis , Qingdao , China I am a British businessman with a factory in China .
Chinese people do not use Google for searching in Chinese .
It is mostly used by salespeople targeting foreign companies to sell their products to .
Google China presented Chinese results in a font that is difficult to read .
Baidu is the search engine of choice in China .
Gordon Styles , Zhongshan China
I operate a web host and at least 90 % of attempted attacks come from China .
I am seriously considering blocking access from China as well .
I am certainly not as big as Google but security of the websites on my server takes number one priority .
None of my customers will loose any sleep over it if I do block China .
Maybe more companies need to do this and just maybe the Chinese government will spend money on stopping the hackers instead of policing innocent internet users .

I love Robert Altman ’s Popeye film , so I ’m not that excited at the prospect of Sony scraping the old idea barrel to come up with this .
I can just picture the suits sitting around the “ idea table ” and coming up with “ awesome 3D ideas ! ”
Someone probably said that having a person repeatedly punch at the audience would be cool – and the idea of punching led to Popeye .
In any case , screenwriter Mike Jones ( The Minotaur Takes a Cigarette Break ) is currently in negotiations to adapt the movie , and according to him , he ’s “ an unabashed , lifelong Popeye fan , and introducing this squinty - eyed sailor to a new generation also means reintroducing him to those who , like me , grew up with him . ”
We ’ll see , Mr. Mike Jones and Sony .
We ’ll see .

SOME people think sports cars are threatened with extinction by tightening restrictions on carbon - dioxide emissions and unacceptable fuel - guzzling .
They fear the roar of the V8 will be replaced by the whirr of the electric armature — and that motoring will never be the same again .
Well , it ought to be quieter , that is true .
But the Jeremy Clarksons and J. Bonington Jagworths of this world need not fear that it will be slower .
The secret ( whisper it , lest puritanical greens find out ) is that electric motors are better than combustion engines .
They have more oomph , and no need of a gearbox to deliver it .
No self - respecting supercar should be without them .
And , at this month 's Geneva motor show , at least three supercar - makers showed that they had got the message .
Lotus , Porsche and Ferrari each unveiled vehicles driven partly by electric motors .
These cars have petrol engines , too , to back the electric ones up ; technically , therefore , they are hybrids .
But that should change in the future as batteries ' storage capacity goes up , and charging time comes down .
Most importantly they show that , sometimes , doing the right thing can be fun .
The launch of the Tesla roadster two years ago demonstrated that electric cars do not have to be slouches .
The Californian company 's small plug - in sports car can accelerate from zero to 96 kph in 3.7 seconds .
It has a range of 393 km ( 244 miles ) once its lithium - ion battery pack is fully charged ( which , admittedly , takes several hours ) .
The Tesla 's rapid acceleration comes from the ability of an electric motor to deliver its maximum amount of torque at whatever speed the motor is turning .
Torque is the scientific term for turning force , and it is measured in newton - metres ( Nm ) .
The Tesla 's motor has a torque of 400 Nm all the way to 5,100 revolutions per minute .
An internal - combustion engine , by contrast , produces maximum torque only at certain speeds .
The 2.0 litre engine of a Lotus Elise S2 , for instance , peaks at 213 Nm at 4,400rpm .
And , whereas a gearbox is needed to use the torque from a combustion engine efficiently , it is unnecessary with the heft of an electric motor .
The motorist 's liberation front
Of three hybrid systems seen at Geneva , Lotus 's is the most electrified .
The British company 's experimental Evora 414E uses two electric motors , each providing 400 Nm of torque .
They power the rear wheels independently .
In addition , the car is fitted with a small “ range - extending ” combustion engine .
This does not drive the wheels , but tops up the batteries if they are in danger of going flat .
Like the Tesla ( which is based on a small Lotus ) , the Evora does not need a gearbox .
Nevertheless , it has been fitted with a “ virtual ” one .
This is to provide the driver with the familiar sensations he would expect from a petrol engine .
So , even though no actual gears are being changed , using the paddle - shift modulates the torque to provide the jolts of acceleration and deceleration that would happen if there were a real gearbox .
It is not all made up .
The paddles also give the driver control of regenerative braking , which translates the kinetic energy that is dissipated when the car slows down into electricity that tops up the batteries .
This slowing effect is used by Lotus to simulate engine braking , in which resistance inside an internal - combustion engine decelerates the car .
“ Shifting ” down into a corner will thus slow the car in the same way it would a car with a gearbox .
“ We believe it will be completely intuitive to drivers , ” says Colin Peachey , one of Lotus 's senior engineers .
Porsche has adopted a different approach with its 918 Spyder .
Its petrol engine , a V8 , is connected to the rear wheels via a seven - speed automated gearbox .
It also , though , has an electric motor that provides additional power to the rear wheels ( through the same gearbox ) and a second electric motor connected directly to the front axle .
Four different running modes are available .
“ E - Drive ” powers the vehicle using only the electric motors for a modest 25 km — enough for commuting .
“ Hybrid ” mode uses electric motors and combustion engine separately or in combination , according to the driving conditions .
“ Sport hybrid ” emphasises performance .
“ Race Hybrid ” really lets rip .
It includes a “ push - to - pass ” button that boosts acceleration by piling on the electrical power .
Porsche expects the 918 Spyder to emit 70 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre travelled , which is about the same as the output of a tiny city car .
Yet it will be able to accelerate to 100 kph in under 3.2 seconds ( a second faster than a Porsche GT3 with a combustion engine ) and will have a top speed of more than 320 k ph .
Moreover , if driven carefully , it will consume just 3 litres of petrol per 100 km ( or 78 miles per American gallon ) .
Porsche and Lotus both use a trick called “ torque vectoring ” to improve handling .
When wheels are being driven directly by electric motors , different levels of torque can be applied to improve stability on corners .
At low speeds , torque vectoring can be used on the Porsche to assist with steering by powering the rear wheels at different rates to create a turning action .
This can make parking easier .
Ferrari's experimental 599 has the car 's V12 engine coupled to a seven - speed automated gearbox which also contains an electric motor .
The same design could be used in both Ferrari 's front and mid-engined cars .
With the batteries below the floor pan , the car 's centre of gravity has been lowered , which improves handling .
Performance is enhanced , says the firm , and carbon - dioxide emissions are cut by 35 % .
Luca di Montezemolo , Ferrari 's boss , expects hybrid systems to be available on all its models within five years .
Many of these features will make their way into all - electric cars too .
Some firms are already looking at all - electric high - performance models .
The Audi e-tron , for instance , is an experimental sports coupe that relies on a battery alone to drive four electric motors — one for each wheel .
By using torque vectoring , it will be capable of an even more responsive version of the brand 's famous “ quattro ” four - wheel drive system .
The quiet future that electric cars could usher in , though , may have to be postponed .
Lotus is adding simulated engine noises to the Evora .
In part this is to meet expected pedestrian - safety legislation , because hybrid and electric cars can be hard to hear at low speeds .
But it also provides drivers with an audible feedback similar to that produced by a combustion engine , which makes driving easier — at least , that 's their story and they 're sticking to it .
And the noise will be selectable .
A gentle , futuristic spaceship - type hum on the way to work , perhaps ?
And the rumble of a mighty V12 on the way home .
This might b he best thing I 've ever seen !
I never liked to think of him growing up and letting Hobbes disappear from his imagination .
This is just how I want to think of them !

IN 1890 , A BEARDED YOUNG POLISH SEAMAN made a trip up the Congo River as a steamboat officer and was appalled by the lust for riches he saw among his fellow Europeans .
A decade later he finally got the experience onto paper .
“ A stream of manufactured goods , rubbishy cottons , beads and brass - wire ” flowed into the interior , wrote Joseph Conrad in Heart of Darkness , “ and in return came a precious trickle of ivory …
The word ‘ ivory ’ rang in the air , was whispered , was sighed .
You would think they were praying to it . ”
The trickle of ivory that Conrad described was highly visible : elephant tusks carried on the shoulders of exhausted porters from the African interior to the coast , where it could be shipped off to Europe to be carved into jewelry , piano keys , and false teeth .
More than 100 years later , far more wealth flows out of this same territory , now the Democratic Republic of Congo , but today much of it ca n’t be seen .
If , for example , you stand beside the washboard dirt road that winds out of the Ituri district of the country ’s northeast , you will see a few vehicles , not more than five or 10 an hour : a dusty SUV , an army jeep , two men on a motorbike , an ancient truck with a precariously high load of fruits and vegetables and a layer of people hitching a ride on top .
But you wo n’t see the treasure they are carrying , for it is too small .
It will be in little plastic bags in someone ’s pocket , or perhaps , better to be concealed from thieves and greedy policemen , sewn into a shirt seam or slipped under a shoe ’s insole .
In this part of the country the main source of wealth is gold .
More than $ 1 billion worth is mined in Congo each year , and a good portion of it comes down this road .
Gold is only one of a half - dozen or more lucrative minerals to be found in Congo , and together they constitute what may be the worst case on Earth of what has come to be known as the “ resource curse . ”
As inevitably as oil drew the United States into Iraq , it is the temptations of this wealth — more than ethnic rivalries , the legacy of colonialism , or anything else — that has turned Congo into the horrific battleground it has been in recent years .
A country with a lavish array of natural riches and a dysfunctional government is like a child heiress without a guardian : Everyone schemes for a piece of what she ’s got .
As far back as Congo ’s history is recorded , the wealth from this vast natural treasure house has flowed almost entirely overseas , leaving some of the planet ’s best - endowed land with some of its poorest people .
I have often heard Congolese friends say , “ We would n’t have so much trouble if we were n’t so rich . ”
Of all the minerals to be found here , none has for so long lit up the eyes of foreigners as the yellow metal that has shaped the course of conquest on almost every continent .
And today , with worldwide economic troubles and ever - rising demand from electronics manufacturing ( see “ The Scary Truth About Your iPhone “ ) sending its price to unimagined heights , a new gold rush is in the making in Congo .
Some of the richest goldfields in all of Africa lie up this dirt road , which begins some 350 miles east of the turnaround point of Conrad ’s nightmare steamboat trip up the Congo River .
The journey there , I hope , will be a way of seeing some of this country ’s tragic — for there is no other word for it — wealth at its point of origin , before it vanishes into jewelry stores and bank vaults and electronics plants in Europe and China , New York and California .
The road begins in war - battered Bunia , capital of the Ituri district .
Driving up it , through the East African savanna toward the rainforest of the interior , is like a journey in time .
Each bend takes you past reminders of the region ’s long , unhappy history and of the successive waves of people who have sought wealth here , most recently in a dozen years of sporadic , bloody fighting that has largely fallen out of the headlines yet still continues , particularly in two provinces just south of Ituri .
From 1895 onward , Europeans eagerly reported traces of gold in Ituri , but only in 1903 did two Australian prospectors , hired by the colonial authorities , examine a riverbed near a village called Krilo and confirm that the find was potentially lucrative .
Whites promptly mangled the name into Kilo , and a few years later the first leg of this road was built for bringing in mining equipment by oxcart .
Congo was then the world ’s only privately owned colony ; its shrewd and ruthless proprietor , King Leopold II of Belgium , had early on in Europe ’s great landgrab secured what he called “ a slice of this magnificent African cake . ”
Belgium itself had not been interested in acquiring a colony , but for its business - minded king — a constitutional monarch with only limited powers at home — that presented an opportunity :
He hired the explorer Henry Morton Stanley to stake out boundaries for him and then pulled off the lobbying coup of the century by persuading the United States and most of Europe to recognize this vast territory as his personal property .
The gold diggers the king put to work here were different from those mining gold at the same time in the Klondike , for they arrived in chains .
Leopold ’s entire colonial economy was based on forced labor , and the system continued after the king , in 1908 , sold his slice of the African cake to the Belgian government ( which finally saw how profitable a colony could be ) and it became the Belgian Congo .
By the following year there were 1,400 African forced laborers at Kilo ; within six years , as mining sites proliferated in the region , the number of people forced to work at them reached 7,500 , and it would expand far more .
As it happened , the arrival of miners was a boon for white ivory traders :
They now had a market for the rest of the elephant , selling dried meat to the mines for their workers .
The Belgians requisitioned laborers from local chiefs and supplied the chains and metal collars or yokes in which they were taken off to the mines .
Chiefs were punished if they failed to provide their quota of men , and were required to supply food and building materials from their villages as well .
The mining industry was hungry for labor , not just to dig for gold , but to carry supplies , firewood , and equipment in weeks - long caravans to the mine sites .
Of the women I see now in long , brightly colored dresses eking out a living selling bananas spread on a piece of cloth at the roadside , how many , I wonder , are the granddaughters or great - granddaughters of those who were marched to the mines in chains ?
One eyewitness account from 1914 describes mothers nursing babies as they carried loads of up to 66 pounds .
Some Kilo miners were forced to work for a decade or more , and released only when they supplied sons to take their places .
Repeated uprisings against the forced - labor regime were brutally suppressed and thousands of deserters were recaptured and put to work again .
The mines paid bonuses to overseers based on the amount of gold mined by the Africans under their control , whose workday rose to 12 hours during World War I .
Discipline was enforced by armed mine police and by the chicotte , a whip of sun-dried hippopotamus hide with razor - sharp edges , whose blows were meticulously tabulated : Records from one group of northeastern Congo gold camps register 26,579 lashes applied to miners during the first half of 1920 alone .
Around that year , the Belgians realized that the harshness of their regime was shrinking the population so rapidly that they would eventually have no labor supply left — you can actually find colonial officials saying this on paper .
The system then became less severe as control of the northeastern gold mines passed from the colonial government to a private corporation .
Gradually , requiring Africans to pay taxes ( for which they had to earn money ) replaced outright coercion as a means of turning subsistence farmers into miners or industrial workers .
Forced labor , however , remained an element of the economy here , as elsewhere in colonial Africa , until the 1940s , and the whip lasted even longer .
Despite having no political rights , the Congolese , ironically , enjoyed their highest standard of living in the decade or so before the colony won its independence in 1960 .
Belgians invested heavily in the gold mines , and although the profits continued to flow back to Europe , the colonizers came to understand that this industry and others would produce more if workers were well fed , healthy , and literate .
Not too literate , mind you :
The colony had one of the best elementary education systems on the continent , but virtually no Africans were trained for management positions .
Schools for whites and blacks were segregated , of course , and no black schools in the gold mining towns went beyond 8th grade .
As we drive further along the road , past trees with high green bunches of papayas , we can see aging brick health clinics and primary schools built during the late colonial era .
OTHER BUILDINGS , abandoned , tell the next phase of the story .
With strong American encouragement , an army officer named Joseph Mobutu seized power in a military coup in 1965 .
For 32 years he maintained a repressive , disastrous dictatorship , changing his name to Mobutu Sese Seko and his country ’s to Zaire .
Delighted to have an anti-communist ally who was friendly to American investors and helpful in covert military operations , the United States enthusiastically supported him , providing more than $ 1 billion in aid over the decades .
President George H.W. Bush welcomed Mobutu to the White House as “ one of our most valued friends . ”
Sucking his country ’s economy dry , the dictator amassed a personal fortune estimated at $ 4 billion , spending it on assorted palaces , a huge yacht , two private ambulances , an airport near his Congo birthplace , Concorde rentals to pick him up there for trips to Europe , and elegant villas on the French Riviera and in other pleasure spots .
Plum executive positions like those at the Ituri mines Mobutu passed out to members of his clan and to political allies , who knew little about mining , pocketed profits , and let machinery wear out .
By the mid-1970s , gold output was declining every year , and by the end of Mobutu ’s reign most industrial gold mining had come to a halt .
One town we pass , formerly a depot for mining vehicles , is filled with empty workshops , garages , and jumbles of rusted old machinery .
We spot the gray concrete bottom of what was once an Olympic - size swimming pool .
The ladder into the pool and the iron framework of two high - dive platforms are still there .
Some old men sitting in the shade tell us that this was a club for European skilled workers and company officials .
The whites all left soon after independence , they say ; the pool closed some years later .
Since Mobutu ’s overthrow and death in 1997 , Congo has been in the grips of a fiendishly complex and brutal war whose exact toll no one knows .
It may well be in the millions if you count those who died because fleeing their homes or living in packed , disease - ridden refugee camps cut them off from adequate food and medical care .
Women and girls by at least the tens of thousands have been gang - raped by government soldiers and rebel militias , who have found this a chillingly effective method of terrorizing the civilian population of areas they occupy .
This has not been a civil war driven by ideology , but rather a multisided free - for - all driven by plunder .
No fewer than two dozen armed groups signed the most recent of several shaky peace deals , for example .
Among the warring parties have been the ineffectual national government , an array of feuding local ethnic warlords , and nearby African countries hungering for a share of Congo ’s great natural wealth .
Here in Ituri , most of the combat has been between two shifting coalitions of militias , each of them intermittently supported by neighboring Rwanda or Uganda .
Both countries have eagerly eyed Congo ’s gold — and its wealth of other metals necessary to make everything from computers to cell phones , including tin ore , coltan , and tungsten .
Today , with some help from a United Nations peacekeeping force , the northeastern goldfields are back under the Congolese national government ’s military control , but the evidence of fighting is everywhere you look .
We pass the town of Bambu , once the administrative center for the network of Belgian mines in the region .
A guidebook from some 60 years ago recommends the company - run hotel — now long defunct — to the white visitor .
Palm trees shade the dirt streets ; the firs that line one were obviously imported from Europe .
A spacious white plaster and brick villa on a hilltop above town was once the home of the mines ’
Belgian managing director .
When rival warlords and their Ugandan and Rwandan backers battled for control of the area , each side occupied it .
“ They always liked these buildings high on a hill , especially if the Belgians once had them , ” explains my traveling companion , Anneke Van Woudenberg .
She is a longtime Congo specialist for Human Rights Watch and has written a report on exploitation by the mining industry in this region , The Curse of Gold , well known here in its French translation .
Today the Congolese army has taken over the villa as its local headquarters , and several dark - green military trucks are parked outside .
Like the rebel warlords before them , many army officers have profited from gold , sometimes by directly controlling mines and forcing soldiers or villagers to work in them , and sometimes by brazenly insisting that anyone who wants to mine gold nearby has to buy permits from the army .
The desirability of senior army posts is determined not by how many troops you command , but by which mining areas the position controls .
In half a dozen larger Congolese cities , you can find luxurious houses , surrounded by high walls and security guards , owned by generals whose nominal pay is less than $ 100 a month .
The Blood Diamonds Myth
Why boycotting “ conflict minerals ” wo n’t help Congo IN THE 1960s , many Americans boycotted California table grapes to help farmworkers unionize ; in the ’70s and ’ 80s , we boycotted South Africa to help the anti-apartheid movement .
In the late 1990s there was the push to ban “ conflict diamonds , ” which led to the 2002 agreement , now signed by some 75 countries , to boycott diamonds produced by armed rebel groups in Africa and elsewhere .
Should n’t we help war - torn Congo by boycotting “ conflict minerals ” ?
Unfortunately , it ’s not clear that a boycott would do much more than put tens of thousands of miserably paid miners out of work .
Take the rather toothless conflict diamonds accord ( which came about only because the international diamond cartel saw “ blood diamonds ” undercutting its inflated prices ) :
It already applies to Congo , but makes no practical difference since the country ’s diamonds , like the overwhelming majority of its other exports , do n’t come from areas currently at war .
And even when there is a direct connection between war and mining ( as with the minerals sold by the Forces Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda , the genocidaires who have taken refuge in Congo ) , those exports are vexingly difficult to trace .
You can quickly tell where an imported automobile was manufactured , but even the best laboratory tests cannot easily prove where an ounce of gold comes from .
Congo ’s lengthy borders are impossible to police , and certificates of origin are easily forged .
The real problem is not conflict minerals , but the fact that Congo ’s long - suffering people reap only a tiny share of their country ’s vast wealth .
Yet an alternate example is only a few hundred miles away from Congo ’s southern border : Diamond - rich Botswana has used its mines , which are partially owned by the state , to fund infrastructure , education , and health care , as well as set aside a rainy - day fund of nearly $ 7 billion .
A recent joint venture between the government and the diamond giant De Beers is even bringing in some of the cutting and polishing work that used to be done in London , generating thousands of jobs .
But Botswana has something essential Congo does not : a government known for being both functional and honest .
THE BIG MINES may be closed , but that does not mean mining in Ituri has stopped .
Along the side of the road walk men in gum boots and sweaty T - shirts , balancing heavy sacks of rocks on their heads .
They will put the rocks in a metal bucket and pound them into dust with an iron bar .
Then they will combine the dust with water and mercury — which attracts the specks of gold — and , trying not to breathe the toxic fumes , will heat the gold - mercury mix in a pot over an open wood fire to evaporate the mercury .
At one point our car is suddenly waved to a stop by two sentries at a checkpoint .
“ Du thé !
Un sucré ! ” ( some tea , something sweet — slang for bribes ) they say through the car window , each rubbing thumb and forefinger together .
Van Woudenberg , undaunted , gets out to deal with them and a superior , with a brimmed military cap and red braid , who emerges sternly from a little guardhouse .
Anywhere you travel in Congo , uniformed men demand money ; soldiers and police are paid little to begin with , and much of that vanishes into the pockets of higher - ups before it ever reaches them .
But this time a curious thing happens .
When the chief of this little extortion post examines Van Woudenberg ’s passport , he looks up and says , “ You ’re the woman who wrote The Curse of Gold !
I ’ve read it three times ! ”
He sends us on our way with a smile .
There is something moving about this : a petty thief applauding someone who has exposed grand theft .
Some three hours up the road , we reach the town of Mongbwalu , which sits next to a gold deposit so coveted that the town changed hands five times in the battling between rival ethnic militias in the last decade , leaving some 2,000 people in the vicinity dead during one seven - month period .
Warlords wanted the gold to buy weapons — often from the corrupt national army that supposedly was trying to suppress them .
The old refinery here is now a rusted skeleton , destroyed by fighting in 2002 .
Some eerie video footage taken here that year provides a microcosm of the entire war .
Civilians are seen fleeing , carrying rolled - up mattresses on their heads .
Meanwhile , officers in berets , boots , and camouflage fatigues from the militia group Union des Patriotes Congolais , which had taken the town a few days before , are carefully examining still - intact refining machinery , a crushing mill , and football - size chunks of gold ore .
A Ugandan TV correspondent , doubtless at the request of the militiamen who ’ve invited him along , goes on camera to urge “ foreign investors ” to help get the mines working again .
The warring militias assumed that multinational corporations would have few scruples about dealing with warlords if the stakes were high enough .
They turned out to be right .
We spend the night under mosquito nets at the town ’s Catholic mission , where a priest was tortured and murdered during the war .
The colonial - era guidebook describes Mongbwalu as having “ hospitals for Europeans and natives , ” but today the grandest relic of those times is a spacious cathedral , built by the Belgians in the 1930s , with arched windows and a dark - stained wood ceiling within which other priests hid during the last round of massacres .
From the cathedral ’s front steps is a lovely view of green hills that are the western edge of the great equatorial rainforest .
Above the altar hangs another glimpse into the colonial past : a huge , mural - like painting .
Madonna and child float on a golden cloud ; on the ground below , offering flowers in adoration , are nine or 10 African adults and children , several carrying a flag emblazoned with the name of the old Belgian mining company .
In a bottom corner , a frightened - looking witch doctor , with feather headdress and necklace of shells , is fleeing the scene , vanquished by the combination of corporate power and the Virgin Mary .
ALTHOUGH corporate mining has reaped billions from Ituri over the decades , during the war it was largely on hold .
Multinational corporations prefer a government weak enough not to tax and regulate heavily but strong enough to guarantee order .
Today the fighting in the goldfields area has subsided , the price of gold is soaring , and the conveniently weak Congolese government is back in control .
Industrial mining is about to begin again , big - time .
Just as Australian prospectors set off the first scramble for Ituri gold a century ago , an Australian is chief prospector in Mongbwalu today .
Geologist Adrian Woolford , who is 30 “ and getting older by the minute , ” is exploration manager for a subsidiary of South Africa - based AngloGold Ashanti , the world ’s third - largest gold mining company .
Tall , thin , bearded , in khaki shorts and khaki shirt with the sleeves rolled up , Woolford draws the good pay necessary to lure highly trained specialists to this remote spot .
He gets two weeks off for every six he works .
On his last two - week break , he vacationed in Cambodia ; on the next he will go to Brazil .
Several hundred yards away people are living in dirt - floored huts lit by candles or kerosene lanterns , but in the mining company ’s hilltop compound we are in a little Western island of flush toilets and working electricity .
On his computer monitor Woolford shows us a three - dimensional image , which he can rotate so we can see it from any side or from above or below , of what ’s underground at Mongbwalu .
Bodies of gold ore in brilliant red and yellow are separated by thin green lines of other rock .
The image also shows some of the more than 500 sampling holes that have been sunk in the ground with diamond - bit drills , some of them extending nearly 2,000 feet down .
The drilling has confirmed a treasure trove .
Beneath less than one square kilometer of ground , next to the hill we ’re on , Woolford says , are more than 2.5 million ounces of gold , worth about $ 3 billion at current prices .
And it is found at the rate of about three grams per ton of rock — an extraordinarily high batting average for a deposit this big — all of it within an easy 800 feet of the surface .
The company has about 250 employees on this site .
Mostly they work inside the compound , tightly protected by guards who include Nepalese Gurkha veterans of the British army .
( These are provided by a subsidiary of ArmorGroup , the security firm whose guards at the US Embassy in Afghanistan were at the center of a hazing scandal disclosed last September . )
The compound ’s gates , floodlights , and high razor - wire fence prompt Joel Bisubu , a Congolese human rights activist traveling with us , to call it “ Guantánamo . ”
AngloGold Ashanti recently finalized a series of agreements with the government under which it will begin mining here and at another major site in the northeast .
At Mongbwalu , it will have an 86 percent share of the operation ; the near - bankrupt former state mining company , now being privatized , will have the remainder .
Four other multinationals — based in London , Canada , and South Africa — have likewise concluded closed - door agreements over mining rights .
No one will ever know what Congolese government officials may have reaped from these deals in the way of quietly promised jobs , favors , or money under the table , in a country where such rewards are routine .
Representatives of local communities , meanwhile , found it hard to get a seat at the negotiating table .
Seldom , in fact , do local communities gain much from such agreements ; that is part of the resource curse .
This pattern is all the stronger in a place where the national government has as fragmentary a hold as it does here .
A failed state fails its people in many ways , and one of them is that , in a world of powerful corporate players , a weak and corrupt government has no bargaining power .
For industrial mining that could create new skilled jobs , Congo desperately needs the expertise and investment capital that , for better or worse , only a multinational can offer .
But a company like AngloGold Ashanti , with more than 60,000 employees at work on four continents , can easily invest elsewhere if the terms in Congo are not to its liking .
The company would not score high in any social - responsibility sweepstakes .
During the war years , lucrative mining concessions changed hands many times between companies eager for future profits and warlords happy to sign contracts .
Despite a United Nations embargo on dealings with rebel groups , AngloGold Ashanti made payments to the warlord who controlled Mongbwalu some six years ago , also providing him and his entourage rides in company planes and vehicles , and a house on its concession .
While spending millions of dollars prospecting , it has made only small contributions to a local hospital , schools , a soccer tournament , and the like , keeping at arm ’s length a coalition of local groups and churches lobbying for this desperately poor community .
“ Of everything we ’ve put in our list of demands and grievances , ” says Richard Magabusini , an elected chief who is a member of the coalition , “ nothing has been done .
They keep saying , ‘ We ’re just prospecting .
We ’ll look at all this later . ' ”
AngloGold Ashanti prefers to deal instead with a collection of more pliable community representatives it has assembled , rather like a company union .
Another point of tension with people here is whether the company will dig a large open - pit mine or sink shafts to tunnel underground .
For gold deposits nearer the surface , the company almost certainly will do the first , which is far cheaper ; people who live here want it to do the second , for open - pit mining strips away fertile topsoil , leaves a huge gouge in the landscape , and can pollute rivers and streams .
Here , it would also require moving an entire village .
“ We have our ancestral secrets in our communities that must not be disturbed , ” says Chief Magabusini .
“ We are categorically demanding that they not move people . ”
As the company takes its slice of the African cake , only a tiny percentage of the proceeds from those 2.5 million ounces of gold is likely to stay in Congo — and even then , much of what does will probably leak into high officials ’ private bank accounts .
AngloGold Ashanti mined more than $ 1.5 billion worth of gold in neighboring Tanzania between 2000 and 2007 , but only 9 percent of that money has remained in the country as taxes or royalties .
Where do the profits go instead ?
A good chunk comes to the United States , for even though the company is based in South Africa , its largest single shareholder — hedge fund billionaire John Paulson — lives on the Upper East Side and summers in the Hamptons .
He owns 12 percent of the company , and a number of other Americans have shares .
THE BIG MONEY in gold mining comes to those who can afford to dig massive mines and build refineries to process the ore .
But those who cannot , an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 people in Congo ’s northeast — including some 10,000 children — dig for gold literally by hand , much the way men did in California in 1849 .
Sometimes , risking great danger in the hope of richer ore , these freelance miners slip into abandoned , partly flooded underground mines with rotted roof supports and hack out new tunnels .
Health and safety regulations are in long - forgotten law books only , and no one even records the number of miners maimed or killed each year .
Many of them will be thrown out of work as industrial mining starts up again .
Even at 8:30 on a Sunday night , the dirt streets of Mongbwalu , bordered by open sewage ditches with small plank bridges across them , are filled with rubber - booted miners and lined with people and businesses wanting a share of whatever pittance they have earned : gaudily dressed prostitutes , cafés , a bar with a picture of Jesus on the wall , and dozens of shops that buy gold and sell miners what they need — a raindrop - size silvery globule of mercury in a plastic baggie goes for the equivalent of 75 cents .
We enter one shop , which a sign proclaims as La Grâce à Dieu — Chez Johnny .
A big man in his late 30s chewing a toothpick , Johnny sits behind the dimly lit counter dealing with a procession of men coming in to sell gold .
On a handheld scale he can weigh gold flakes , the occasional tiny nugget , and amalgame , the gold dust separated by mercury from crushed rocks that is 80 to 90 percent pure .
From here the gold will quietly find its way across Congo ’s porous border with Uganda , on to refining in Dubai , and into the voracious world market .
More than 97 percent of Congo ’s gold leaves the country without ever being taxed , according to one recent estimate by the Ministry of Mines .
The weights Johnny uses to measure gold are kitcheles — penny - size coins that date from 40 or 50 years ago , when Congo still used coins .
Now , after decades of headlong inflation , only bills are in circulation .
Each seller is paid with a big brick of them , since even the very largest bill is worth less than $ 1 .
The person Johnny is buying from when we come in , a stocky , silent man of perhaps 40 who does n’t want to say where his gold came from , looks too old to have mined the metal himself , Van Woudenberg and Bisubu think ; he ’s probably a middleman who spent the day buying from miners .
He walks off with a wad of bills about three inches thick , worth some $ 60 .
Most of the men who sell gold to Johnny spend some of their earnings in his store , buying soft drinks , rice , biscuits , toilet paper , sardines , flour , or lanterns , all arrayed on shelves behind him .
He also sells mining supplies , of which the most important , for the equivalent of $ 5 apiece , are shovel blades — you cut your own handle in the rainforest .
A blade lasts two months , less if you ’re digging in rocky soil .
But , as always seems to be the case in Congo , the shop ’s profits are going elsewhere , for this is not Johnny ’s own business , he explains ; its patron , or owner , is in Butembo , many hours away .
He calls Johnny every morning on his cell phone — there are no landlines here — to tell him the price to pay for gold that day .
THE NEXT MORNING we jounce and bump a half - hour farther into the hills , past the village of round thatched huts that will vanish if AngloGold Ashanti digs its open - pit mine , to the small town of Pili - Pili .
From its one sweltering , sunbaked street we descend another half - hour , on foot now , steeply downward into a valley , past flame trees with red blossoms , butterflies flitting about blue flowers , and grass that reaches higher than our heads .
On a patch of land most of the way down is a camp where hundreds of miners live , divided into teams of up to 15 men , in huts whose walls are reddish mud packed around interwoven sticks .
The overhanging roofs are grass thatch ; sometimes a blue plastic sheet with a UNICEF emblem — from aid supplies to refugee camps — is thrown on top for additional rainproofing .
All food , drinking water , and mining tools are carried in .
On the walls of the camp chief ’s dirt - floored hut are two large Inauguration Day posters of Barack Obama .
It ’s only about 10 in the morning , but the tropical sun is already broiling .
Farther down the trail we stop to talk to a young miner with a gentle smile and intelligent eyes , walking back uphill to Pili - Pili .
His name is Alex , and he is 22 .
He says he had to drop out of high school two years ago for lack of money , and has been mining ever since .
“ There is no work in Congo .
We suffer a lot . ”
He and the friend who is with him , he explains , are cascadeurs — a word that normally , as French film buffs know , means movie stuntman , but here it means someone working odd corners , who does not belong to one of the teams .
Alex shows us a small plastic bag of sand , with tiny flecks of gold in it , which , he estimates , the two of them can sell in Pili - Pili for the equivalent of $ 1 .
That ’s their usual take for an entire day , and they are delighted to have found this much so early .
They bid us a warm goodbye and continue up the trail .
The bottom of the valley and the side of the opposite slope are dotted with clusters of men in their teens and 20s .
Miners usually have to buy their places on these 15 - man teams , often going into debt to do so .
We talk to one group , whose members say they started work by lantern light at 3 a.m. , to get as much as possible done before the midday heat .
Shovels are their only visible hand tools , and with them they have gouged an indentation perhaps 20 feet wide and 20 deep out of the side of the hill .
At the bottom of it , they ’ve also dug a tunnel about 3 feet high , with just enough room to enter on hands and knees , extending 12 or 15 feet into the earth , as far as you can go without danger of the tunnel collapsing , for they believe the dirt farther back has a higher concentration of gold .
A man - high mound of red dirt from all their digging is piled up next to the stream that runs along the valley bottom , and now two of the men turn to another task : one tossing shovel - loads of dirt and the other pouring pans of stream water into the upper end of a homemade chute of boards .
Mud flows down the chute , across a patch of woolen blanket crossed by leafy twigs , which slow down the flow and give the heavier gold a chance to sink to the blanket , where the specks will stick and can be carefully removed .
A majority of these men , they tell us , with smiles and laughs as we ask each in turn , are former militia fighters from rival groups .
But now this past seems forgotten as they all focus on finding enough gold to survive .
They say that on an average day the team finds $ 30 to $ 50 worth to divide 15 ways .
Off the top , 30 percent ( plus a hefty initial fee before the team could even start working here ) has to be given to the patron who has the mining rights to this site , plus gold miners face a bewildering variety of other fees , the largest of which is about $ 3 per week per miner in payoffs to the army or police , as protection against harassment .
What ’s left , for the average Ituri miner and his family , is roughly $ 40 to $ 60 a month .
Finally we head up the trail again , wanting to climb back to Pili - Pili before the sun reaches its zenith .
A miner coming down who passes us wears a T - shirt that has found its way here from somewhere ; across the chest is printed STAYTRUEDREAMTRUE .
Passing back through the miners ’ camp , we stop to chat for a moment about how hard the work looks and how meager the rewards .
One man says simply , “ We ’re on automatic . ”
Back in Pili -Pili , on the street we run into Alex and his friend , the cascadeurs .
They ’ve sold their dollar ’s worth of gold from this morning , he says , and with it bought a breakfast of green beans .
Now they ’re about to head back down to the valley again to try to find enough gold to buy dinner .
I always felt I miss context when I use Pdb .
I mean that I do not see enough lines of code around the one I am stepping on .
I am a deeply convinced VIM user .
EMACS users , please do not flame , it just happened that I started with VIM .
I could have started with EMACS but I am too lazy to start to learn again .
When Stefan Eletzhofer relased vimpdb almost two years ago , I immediately tried it .
However , I did not use it further as using VIM menus to drive Pdb was far from convenient .
Last fall , Stefan released vimpdbhook , another attempt to integrate Pdb into VIM .
Again , it was still not that usable and it was restricted to Mac users .
This time , however , I felt I had to scratch the itch .
I started to improve vimpdbhook .
This lead me to a better understanding of both pdb.py and communication to VIM .
Lastly , Jean - Francois Roche and I used our flights from and to PyCon 2010 to hack on vimpdbhook .
We ended reusing good ideas / code from vimpdb and from VimPdb.vim .
It worked well and the result is something pretty usable .
We released a new version of vimpdb : 0.3.2
I would like to thank Stefan of kindly accepting that we release the new code under the same package name .
It is still work in progress .
We need to ease setup and to improve the UI in VIM .
Hereunder , an excerpt from the README .
Using
Using vimpdb is easy -- just call set_trace as usual :
import vimpdb ; vimpdb.set_trace ( )
Now , when the python interpreter hits that line , VIM will get the focus and load the source file .
Now you 'll be able to use the following commands : VimPDB Commands Key Command n Next s Step a Args u Up d Down r Return c Continue b Sets a breakpoint at the line on which the cursor is sitting .
w
Displays the value of the word on which the cursor is sitting .
x Switch to debugging with standard Pdb. v Switch back to VimPdb from plain Pdb .
Please let us know what works for you and what does not .
If you feel like fixing bugs or adding features , the code is available at http://github.com/gotcha/vimpdb .

At last , one of Pope Benedict 's closest aides uses the word " conspiracy " in relation to the systematic global cover - up of child abuse by paedophile Catholic priests .
Unfortunately , Cardinal José Saraiva Martins believes the conspiracy is against the Catholic church , which is its victim .
" We should not be too scandalised if some bishops knew about it but kept it secret , " he this week told reporters of the sexual abuse , on the same day the Vatican newspaper opted to blame the media for " ignoring the facts " .
" This is what happens in every family , you do n't wash your dirty laundry in public . "
Though Saraiva Martins declined to spell out who was behind the conspiracy , he informed his listeners darkly : " There is a well - organised plan , with a clear aim . "
For those who imagined church - related conspiracies as involving psychotic albino monks , easily decipherable holy grail puzzles , and some guff about the sacred feminine , this all comes as something of a shock .
I suppose a cryptex that falls open if you align the letters N , O , N , C and E may yet surface , and x-ray analysis might discover the words " perhaps he could teach at a girls ' school next time ? " concealed in the rural backdrop of the Mona Lisa .
But for now , if we are to extrapolate his eminence 's meaning correctly , the situation seems to be that some shadowy organisation deputised innumerable priests to abuse innumerable children down the decades ( and , it seems fairly reasonable to assume , down the centuries ) .
These same obscure evil masterminds then contrived to manipulate the most senior church figures – possibly Calvinist sleepers .
Let 's not rule anything out – into sweeping the lot under the carpet , frequently allowing priests to be relocated and begin their reign of unbearable horror anew .
Then , many years later , our secretive society of conspirators would marshal a co-ordinated global attack by survivors of the abuse , whistle - blowing priests , and the media .
This attack would also expose the paper trail of several of these cover-ups , and by some awesomely fiendish orchestration , paths would increasingly lead to the office of the pontiff , who would by that time be the very bloke who had headed the Vatican morals watchdog for the two decades from which some of the highest profile cases date .
It 's quite a conspiracy , is n't it ?
By comparison , hiding the existence of a bloodline stemming from the issue of Jesus and Mary Magdalene for 2,000 years seems about as challenging as falling off a log located three foot from the earth 's centre of gravity .
Clearly , a plot this complex would be beyond even the capabilities of Spectre .
In fact , rather confusingly , one of the only non-governmental international organisations powerful enough to perpetuate any sort of enduring global conspiracy – apart from the Illuminati , Colonel Sanders and whichever lizards David Icke is currently warning against – is the Catholic church .
That is merely one of the many ironies to this growing scandal , though considering the hideous wrongs done to generations of children at the heart of the matter , it is by no means the most revolting .
Considerable more distasteful , for instance , is the Vatican 's firefighting strategy .
When confronted by this week 's revelations from Wisconsin , where it emerged that as a cardinal , Benedict appears to have chosen not to discipline a priest accused of abusing up to 200 deaf boys in one school alone , the response of the Vatican newspaper was to accuse the media of acting ignobly .
Meanwhile , instead of insisting on the resignation of Sean Brady , the Irish cardinal who was complicit in two abuse victims being made to sign an oath of silence , Benedict last week responded by sending Irish Catholics an open letter ( the paucity of the response rather grimly underscored by the fact that a few days later , West Ham chairman David Sullivan fell back on the same device to excuse a run of poor football results ) .
Right up there with the most iniquitous church attitudes on display , however , is Cardinal Saraiva Martins 's implication that the abuse – or more pertinently the ongoing discovery of it by outsiders – is not a horror of the Vatican 's own making but a trial sent to test it .
As for who sends such tests , one can only speculate , remembering that of his apparently reluctant elevation to the papacy , Benedict once revealed : " I prayed to God ' please do n't do this to me ' . "
How distressingly easy it is to imagine almost that precise prayer being offered up by countless desperate , terrified children .
Yet as the abuse scandal closes in on his own involvement , the question is whether Benedict will have the brass neck to extend the logic and yet again cite that odd abnegation of ultimate responsibility to his unseen boss .
It 's not the sort of argument that tends to stand up in court , admittedly .
But then , that 's hardly relevant , as you 'll have noted the absence of police chiefs in the scandal - hit dioceses pulling in any suspected coverers - up for questioning , let alone the righteous emergence of anyone approaching a pan-continental Yates of the Yard figure .
Indeed , given this is hardly the time to joke that a keen applicant 's hobbies should include taking riverside strolls with bricks in their pockets , we might as well accept that the compensation lawyers are our best hope .

There is a thesis that the banks are in control of the Fed and as a result have gained control over the issuance of the currency of the United States .
This thesis is based on the fact that the shares of the Federal Reserve Bank are held by these private banks .
Does that mean that the private banks own the Fed ?
The short answer is yes , but it is a hollow ownership with very restricted rights .
This ownership basically exists to give credence to the claim that the fed is independent .
It is appropriately described as follows in the Fed 's own publication " Federal Reserve System Purposes & Functions " :
The holding of this stock , however , does not carry with it the control and financial interest conveyed to holders of common stock in for - profit organizations .
It is merely a legal obligation of Federal Reserve membership , and the stock may not be sold or pledged as collateral for loans .
Member banks receive a 6 percent dividend annually on their stock .
( p. 12 )
This is exactly the manner in which Special Purpose Vehicles ( or Special Purpose Entities ) are created in the corporate world .
There is usually a promoter who does not wish to be seen to own an entity but who wishes to derive some benefit from the existence of such an entity .
Usually , overt ownership would adversely impact the presentation of the promoter 's financial reporting .
The authorities and regulators , including the Fed , are very aware of these Special Purpose structures , as is the accounting profession .
Rules have been devised and implemented to assess any such arrangement in order to establish its true nature .
It is therefore appropriate to assess the Fed 's independence — or , alternatively , interdependence — according to the very rules that it uses to assess Special Purpose Entities .
First , let 's draw the simple ownership structure .
Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of accounting principles would know that ownership of an entity without control over that entity requires further investigation .
Consolidation of a group of companies can become complex when ownership and control are split .
The GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ) method in this case disregards ownership and focuses on control .
For example , a right to appoint the majority of the board of directors even in the absence of ownership would trigger a consolidation of that entity .
Thus the controller and the entity would be seen as part of a group and collectively as a single interdependent consolidated entity .
It follows that the simple structure of the Federal Reserve Banks drawn above is a split structure , where " ownership " is of limited significance and " control " must be established .
Control will tell us whether the entities are independent or interdependent .
All regulation targets " control , " not just the legal form of ownership .
Accounting principles of consolidation have evolved from Special Purpose Vehicles , to Special Purpose Entities , and very lately — with the revision in June 2009 for implementation in January 2010 of Financial Accounting Standard 46 ( R ) ( " FIN 46 ( R ) " ) — they have evolved into the concept of a " Variable Interest Entity . "
In effect , the test of whether one organization is a " Variable Interest Entity " controlled by another organization is similar to a DNA test to determine whether two people are members of the same family .
FIN 46 ( R ) defines a " variable interest " as follows :
The enterprise with a variable interest or interests that provide the enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity will have both of the following characteristics : a .
The power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity 's economic performance b.
The obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity .
( par. 1A ) [ 1 ]
The first test is to check for " the power to direct the activities . "
Who exactly holds that power ?
Here we turn to the Federal Reserve Act , which instructs the Regional Federal Reserve Banks to each elect their own board of directors , of which the chairman and vice chairman of the regional board will be appointed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System .
The regional boards must have nine directors in three classes of three each ( A , B and C directors ) : three A directors chosen by the stockholders ; three B directors to represent the " public " ; and three C directors to be appointed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System .
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System will appoint the chairman and vice chairman from the ranks of the three C directors .
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System seems to have powers that could indicate " control , " including the appointment of the power positions of chairman and vice chairman .
However , we must also ask whether the regional boards have the independent powers normally associated with ownership and control , or if their powers are restricted and controlled in any manner .
The answer again lies in the Federal Reserve Act :
Said board of directors shall administer the affairs of said bank fairly and impartially and without discrimination in favor of or against any member bank or banks and may , subject to the provisions of law and the orders of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , extend to each member bank such discounts , advancements , and accommodations as may be safely and reasonably made with due regard for the claims and demands of other member banks , the maintenance of sound credit conditions , and the accommodation of commerce , industry , and agriculture .
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may prescribe regulations further defining within the limitations of this Act the conditions under which discounts , advancements , and the accommodations may be extended to member banks .
( section 4 , par . 8 )
The regional boards are limited in their ability to perform the primary functions of the Regional Federal Reserve Bank by the terms of the act and by the control of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System .
It is clear from the Federal Reserve Act that control does not rest in the Regional Federal Reserve Boards , nor are they independent , but they take instruction and are controlled by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System .
It is now appropriate to update the simplified structure drawn above , in order to add these two steps of control .
The question of who has control is not yet resolved ; the nature of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System must be investigated next .
Is the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System an independent body or beholden to another entity ?
The " Purposes & Functions " document describes the nature of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System :
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is a federal government agency .
The Board is composed of seven members , who are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the U.S. Senate .
The Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Board are also appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate .
The nominees to these posts must already be members of the Board or must be simultaneously appointed to the Board . ( p. 4 )
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is a federal government agency .
The power to appoint its members , chairman , and vice chairman is vested in the president of the United States , with the Senate having a veto power over any appointment .
The first requirement for a " variable interest , " " the power to direct the activities " is fulfilled : the federal government at the presidential level holds " the power to direct activities . "
The final version of the structure of control is as follows :
The next requirement that must be met for a " variable interest " is either an " obligation to absorb losses " or a " right to receive benefits . "
I would argue that the Fed 's right to create currency , together with the vested interests of federal government , are more than sufficient to infer an " obligation to absorb losses . "
The Federal Reserve
Act adds a complication to this argument by holding the shareholders responsible to the extent of their stockholding for the liabilities of the Regional Federal Reserve Banks .
However , the " obligation to absorb losses " is not a requirement that needs to be met so long as the alternative , the " right to receive benefits " requirement , is met .
Since the obligation is not clear cut , it is better to concentrate on the right .
Note that neither the obligation nor the right need to be absolute .
Again we can turn to the two sources , the Federal Reserve Act and the Fed publication " Federal Reserve System Purposes & Functions " for guidance .
Federal Reserve Act :
Dividends and Surplus Fund of Reserve Banks ( a) After all necessary expenses of a Federal reserve bank have been paid or provided for , the stockholders of the bank shall be entitled to receive an annual dividend of 6 percent on paid - in capital stock .
The entitlement to dividends under subparagraph ( A ) shall be cumulative .
That portion of net earnings of each Federal reserve bank which remains after dividend claims under subparagraph ( 1 ) ( A ) have been fully met shall be deposited in the surplus fund of the bank .
( b ) Transfer for fiscal year 2000 .
The Federal reserve banks shall transfer from the surplus funds of such banks to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the general fund of the Treasury , a total amount of $ 3,752,000,000 in fiscal year 2000 .
Of the total amount required to be paid by the Federal reserve banks under paragraph ( 1 ) for fiscal year 2000 , the Board shall determine the amount each such bank shall pay in such fiscal year .
During fiscal year 2000 , no Federal reserve bank may replenish such bank 's surplus fund by the amount of any transfer by such bank under paragraph ( 1 ) . ( section 7 )
" Federal Reserve System Purposes & Functions " :
The income of the Federal Reserve System is derived primarily from the interest on U.S. government securities that it has acquired through open market operations .
Other major sources of income are the interest on foreign currency investments held by the System ; interest on loans to depository institutions ; and fees received for services provided to depository institutions , such as check clearing , funds transfers , and automated clearinghouse operations .
After it pays its expenses , the Federal Reserve turns the rest of its earnings over to the U.S. Treasury .
About 95 percent of the Reserve Banks ' net earnings have been paid into the Treasury since the Federal Reserve System began operations in 1914 .
( Income and expenses of the Federal Reserve Banks from 1914 to the present are included in the Annual Report of the Board of Governors . )
In 2003 , the Federal Reserve paid approximately $ 22 billion to the Treasury .
( p. 11 )
The statement that " about 95 % of the Reserve Banks ' net earnings have been paid into the Treasury since the Federal Reserve System began operations in 1914 " says it well enough .
It is an irrefutable fact that the federal government possesses the overwhelming " right to receive benefits . "
The outright , indisputable conclusion is that the Fed , when tested against GAAP as the Fed itself uses it in the Fed 's assessments of those it regulates , is a Special Purpose Entity of the federal government ( or , according to the latest definition , is a Variable Interest Entity of the federal government ) .
The rules of consolidation therefore apply , and the Fed must be seen as controlled by federal government , making it indivisibly part of the federal government .
The pretence of independence is no more that that , a pretence .
There is , however , no denying that the banks have tremendous vested interest in influencing the policies of the Fed , nor that the power being so narrowly vested in the president makes him a special target for influence .
Still , the power to control the Fed is not in the hands of its " owners " but firmly in the hands of the federal government and the president of the United States .
Roast Turkey Since 1995
This posting is a little bit different for me .
First off , I ’ve made a batch of graphs .
That I ’ve done so at all is a bit “ new ” for me .
But beyond that , I ’ve made the graphs before even starting the article .
It was the data that got me looking , but the graphs that made the case .
And what is that case ?
That it ’s a bad idea to play with the instrumentation .
First , the motivation .
In looking at the GISS anomaly maps , Turkey is always roasting .
There was something about that that just seemed wrong .
It ought to have been a more random event ; who was Hot Hot Hot and who was not .
So I took a look at the dT / dt report and and noticed that there was a clear “ kink ” in the data .
It was running along flat , then about 1991 – 1995 it popped up and then continued running fairly flat with some rise .
Odd , that ‘ step function ’ .
CO2 does not do a step function .
Airports do n’t do a step function .
UHI does not do a step function …
( For folks new to this : dT / yr is the “ average of the changes of temperature , month now vs the same month that last had valid data , for each year ” .
An anomaly process similar to First Differences .
Then dT is the running total of those changes , or the total change , the “ Delta Temperature ” to date . )
You will probably want to click on the graphs to get a bigger version to look at .
Notice that the dT line is the “ cumulative ” dT / yr .
Notice also that right around 1990 the dT / yr goes very small in range .
The volatility just leaves it .
So we see that dT is running along at a lower value , and dT / yr is dead flat for a couple of years , THEN about 1994 dT / yr pops up and dT starts a run for the moon .
So what happened between 1990 and 1994 ?
The Great Dying Of Thermometers took out a lot of thermometers .
Further , a bunch of old “ Duplicate Number ” flags end ( that I ’ve been calling “ modification flags ” , but I ’m swapping over to the NCDC name ) and some new ones begin .
Turkey had a fairly large number of thermometers , but that number plunges .
Still , it ’s a bit large for really seeing exactly what happens thermometer by thermometer .
We ’ll see a clearer example down below in Mauritius .
But for now , we need to slice a little Turkey …
Looking at the temperature data directly , there were a lot of overlapping adds and drops .
Duplicate Number flag 0 or 1 that carried forward and overlapped with Duplicate Number flag 2 or even flag 3 .
So their is a bit of ‘ feathering ’ or ‘ blending ’ of the dropping , adding , and changing .
I believe that is why when you look at the dT / yr right about 1989 – 1993 it goes to very small volatility , even though a large number of thermometers leave the record ( or perhaps , because of it ) .
Eventually we are left with a lot of new Duplicate Number flag thermometers and very few of the older consistent record .
What is a “ Duplicate Number ” flag ?
It is an indication that SOMETHING about that data record is different and that it needs different handling than the prior record .
It could be a new thermometer at that location , or it could be a new Time Of Observation ( changed procedures ) or it might be simply that the thermometers and the TOBS are the same , but some “ post processing ” is different .
A different QA method tossing out “ outliers ” or a different “ TOBS adjustment ” or just about anything .
Basically , it means “ Something that matters changed ” .
I ’d say so …
Now look again at the dT / yr line .
Notice anything ?
Run your eye along the peaks at about the 1.3 C level just above the 1 C line .
Notice the consistent peaks ?
Now run your eye along the - 1 C line .
Notice the consistent peaks starting before 1970 ?
Now run your eye along at about - 0.5 C. Notice how much more area is in the down spikes before 1990 when compared with after ?
Something started to slightly clip the lower excursions in the ’ 80s , but that 1990 change substantially eliminates them and strongly dampens or blunts any more than about - 0.75 C and reduces the number significantly .
Do n’t know what it was , but it happens at the same time the Duplicate Number flags change .
And We ’ve seen this in Canada ( as the Smith Effect at Fort Smith ) and I ’ve seen it in dozens of other cases around the planet .
The “ warmth ” is from clipping of the cold spikes , and it has onset with the Duplicate Number flag change .
The Ugliest Graph You Will Ever Love
In this graph , instead of the average dT / year we see the individual months dT for that year .
So there are 12 lines in this “ Spaghetti graph ” for dT ( per month ) / yr . Maybe we ought to call it a ‘ hair graph ’ ;-) and that makes it look useless at this compressed scale .
But click on it and enlarge it .
Now the monthly extremes are much more visible .
The “ spikes ” of monthly temperature changes are “ spikier ” .
The “ clipping ” is fairly clearly seen .
The start of the newer Duplicate Number flags dampens the really deep downward spikes ( as they average with the older Duplicate Number flags ) but in 1990 when the old Duplicate Number flags are dropped and only the new carry forward , the “ cold spikes ” look to me to be lifted to where what in the past was a - 6 is now the few - 4 about 2001 and the prior - 4 spikes are now running about - 2.5 C .
There is what looks like a little muting of the “ top spikes ” but not nearly so much .
Again , why is completely unknown .
One would need to look up what those Duplicate Number flags indicate changed at that location to figure out ‘ what changed ’ .
But that it changed and the fact that it changed in a step function is pretty clear …
So , Are The Trends of the Two Segments Different ?
You Bet !
A Cleaner Case – Mauritius
Is there a simpler place ?
Somewhere with fewer thermometers and a clearer point in time when things ‘ cut over ’ ?
Yes , several .
This is just one of a half dozen I found in looking at about a dozen randomly chosen places .
The scale here is much shallower than for Turkey , since these are Islands in a warm ocean .
But even here we can see a “ muting ’ of the down spikes of dT / yr such that they do n’t reach the - 0.5 C line and rarely get through the - 0.25 C line after the change of Duplicate Number flags .
If we look at the two segments , before and after the 1990 era Duplicate Number flag change , do we find a difference ?
Oh yeah .
Again we do see the top peaks slightly muted , but the bottom going peaks are much more muted and the effect of that “ peak clipping ” of the dT /yr , and muting the depth and quantity of the bottoms ; is a dramatic change in the dT line .
I ’ll spare you the “ Hair Graph ” of the monthly data …
Unless requested …
And it is all done with ‘ anomalies ’ so it must be right ;-)
( For folks unaware of it , perhaps a long time after this is written , there has been a bit of a “ tiff ” about the fact that I do n’t use anomalies for all my investigations .
It ’s been asserted that if you use anomalies things come out right and if you do n’t they come out wrong .
Well , I ’m from a school of thought that says you use ALL the tools you have and see if they all agree .
It ’s more of a “ forensics ” mind set .
I ’ve done computer forensics , and one of the things you learn is that it is much much harder to ‘ cook the books ’ so they come out right under ALL available tools …
So always “ Come to your opponent out of the Sun . ” and “ Take nothing that he offers to you . ”
Sun Tzu .
And the best way to assure you have found ‘ where the sun is ’ in a forensics exam is to come at the data from ALL sides .
And never do things in the usual way or the way the other side suggests they ought to be done ; if possible , approach from exactly the other direction … )
Conclusion
Now , I have no idea what Duplicate Number flag 3 means .
It could be the change from Liquid In Glass to Electronic , or it could be a different QA procedure , or a move from “ Stevenson Screen by the Palm Grove ” to “ near the hangar ” , or who knows what .
But what I can say is that :
1 ) It ’s a Giant “ Dig Here ” .
2 ) It is not CO2 .
3 ) It is directly correlated with the bulk of the change of trend to warming in Mauritius .
4 ) That warming comes , as have most of the cases I ’ve seen , as a Step Function or knee , though there can be some ‘ blending ’ if different records overlap .
5 ) Dropping thermometers matters ( directly , or as here , indirectly via unmasking Duplicate Number flag 3 ) .
6 ) The specifics of the Instruments , Modifications , and the Siting Matters .
A Lot .
7 ) It ’s not the “ kept ” vs “ tossed ” that matters it ’s the “ kept ” vs “ replacement ” at the mod flag level .
What the Input Data Looks Like – Sample Duplicate Number Flags
OK , I ca n’t make a new posting full of graphs without having at least some tables … do n’t want to have withdrawal shock ;-) so here are some small tables showing some of the “ Duplicate Number flag ” changes in Mauritius .
These are mostly for documentation of what to look for in the data for folks who want to look at the data themselves ; those not interested in the input data will want to skip this part .
The first 3 digits are the Country Code “ 129 ” for Mauritius .
Then 5 + 3 for station and sub-station ID “ 61986 ” + “ 000 ” .
Then the Duplicate Number flag .

We also have a very short lived Duplicate Number flag 2 that looks like someone ran a 10 year experiment .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve would win sweeping new powers over nonbank financial firms and keep much of its authority over banks , under revised legislation to be unveiled on Monday by the chief architect of financial reform in the Senate .

In a remarkable recovery by the U.S. central bank after a steep drop in its political popularity , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd was poised to release a bill that leans heavily on the Fed , sources said on Sunday .
Not only would a new government watchdog for financial consumers be housed within the Fed , but it would also retain much of its present authority over large bank holding companies and gain new authority over selected nonbank financial firms .
Dodd ’s bill would give the Fed authority to supervise bank holding companies with more than $ 50 billion in assets , down from an earlier threshold of $ 100 billion , sources said .
The bill may also preserve the Fed ’s power over state - chartered banks with less than $ 50 billion in assets that are already in the Federal Reserve system , a source said .
An earlier proposal had called for transferring responsibility for supervising such banks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
That would put hundred of banks under the Fed ’s purview , including such giants as Bank of America and Citigroup , as well as branches of foreign banks , a source said .
The bill from Dodd , a Democrat , would also empower the central bank to supervise nonbank firms designated as “ systemically important ” by a council of regulators .
Before it became the poster - child for bailouts , former insurance giant American International Group ( AIG ) would have fit into that category , for instance .
Revamping how the financial system is supervised is one of the Obama administration ’s top priorities .
Since the worst financial crisis in decades tipped the U.S. economy into a deep recession and sent shock waves across world markets , the United States and the European Union have been pursuing reforms .
The White House unveiled a sweeping package of proposals in mid-2009 .
The House of Representatives approved most of them in December in a massive piece of legislation that passed without a single Republican vote of support .
But with lobbyists for banks and Wall Street working hard to block or weaken reforms , the Senate has yet to act .
With congressional elections approaching in November , Dodd is under intense pressure to push a bill through his committee and onto the Senate floor before political campaigns take center stage .
TURNAROUND BY DODD ON FED
Dodd sharply criticized the Fed last year for regulatory failures .
In an early draft of his own reform plan , he proposed stripping the central bank of bank supervision and consumer protection duties , leaving it focused almost exclusively on its role as a monetary policy center .
But Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , other Fed insiders and some banking interests have pushed back hard in recent months to shield the institution , and it appears to have worked .
At the same time that he is proposing new powers for the Fed , Dodd is also considering changes to how regional Federal Reserve bank directors are chosen , a source said .
He also plans to put President Barack Obama ’s proposed financial consumer watchdog in the Fed .
To win support among Democrats for the idea , he will give the watchdog considerable power and autonomy , sources said .
Dodd wants the banking committee to work on his new bill before April , but Republicans have already told him they want sufficient time to consider the legislation .
Dodd ’s bill will attempt to put an end to a market perception that some financial firms are too big to fail after the government used billions of dollars in taxpayer funds to rescue firms such as AIG .
There is agreement that a fund of about $ 50 billion should be created to help pay for the cost of unwinding large troubled firms .
Dodd is also expected to give market regulators the authority to regulate the $ 450 trillion over - the - counter derivatives market with some narrow exemptions .
I made my first Blade Runner pistol when I was 18 , while living in Hell 's Kitchen , NYC .
I stared at the VHS version on pause and made sketches .
Put it together from toys and model kit parts .
It 's lovely and terrible :
( Years later the internet would teach me that the six dollar plastic gun I bought on Canal street in NYC and cannibalized for the grip was created by Edison Giacattoli , a legendary toy gun designer )
I made a crazy accurate scratch - built when I was 30 , from resin and bondo .
I had great picture reference but shitty size reference , it was 20 % too small .
Fuck !
I even had it chrome plated at one point and I weathered it :
In 2006 , the screen - used original surfaced after 25 some - odd years and sold at auction last year for $ 256,000.00 .
Supposedly to Paul Allen
[ That myth has been busted — Mark ] :
This is the final iteration :
It 's 95 % finished .
My hand - built baby .
About 30 - 40 hours of labor spread out over ( at least ) 6 years .
An original Steyr - Mannlicher .222 target rifle receiver and magazine and a Charter Arms Bulldog .44 , both demilled and gunsmithed by me ( working with hardened steel — FUN ! ) with custom machined aluminum and steel parts ( barrel , grip , butt ) and made as close as possible , in every respect , to the original .
Painstaking .
That is all I have to say on the subject ( probably not ) .
I can't even describe how good it feels to hold it in my hand .

Alaska blog Mudflats , and now the Associated Press , have jumped on the story that Palin failed to pay property taxes on two cabins built on land she partially owns .
Her attorney says it 's not her fault .
He argues that it's not a property owners ' responsibility to report structures so they can be taxed .
The state say it is .
Palin 's spokeswoman , Meghan Stapleton , meanwhile , pulled out her well - worn victim card , telling the AP by email : " This is another blatant attempt to manufacture a story about the Palins following more defamatory swipes . "
Man Accused of Medically Impossible Murder Police said James Suttle was guilty , but experiment shows crime was impossible .
March 2 , 2010  --
When James Suttle was arrested for first - degree murder in January 2001 , it was a dramatic turnaround for a man who until that moment seemed to be living a golden life .
Suttle left the town of Pulaski , Tenn. , as a teenager and headed to Las Vegas , where he became a high - stakes professional gambler and entrepreneur .
He had n't been back to Pulaski in nearly 20 years , but he returned in part to see his cousin Stevie Hobbs .
" Me and Stevie were inseparable , " Suttle , 49 , said .
But during his October 1998 visit , Suttle was awakened by Hobbs , who rushed into his bedroom and appeared to be having some kind of attack .
" The first thing I remember was him trying to call my name , " Suttle said .
" He could n't get my whole name out . "
Suttle said his cousin had his hands in the air and spun in a full circle , before ultimately falling backward on top of a glass coffee table .
When the table broke , one of the shards of glass entered Hobbs ' back , apparently killing him .
Suttle called 911 .
But over the next few days , Suttle said he sensed police did n't believe his story .
" I could tell that they were trying to pin this off on me as a murder , " he said .
When Suttle called his ex-wife Jacqueline Wernet and their daughter Jameline , Jacqueline was shocked .
" I could n't believe it because I know how much he loves Stevie , " said Wernet .
" My dad and Steve were so close , " said Suttle 's daughter , Jameline .
" He was like an uncle to me , a brother to my dad . "
Prosecution Finds Mounting Evidence Against Suttle
Despite the close relationship between Hobbs and Suttle , Pulaski , Tenn. , prosecutor Richard Dunavant said the case against Suttle kept escalating .
Suttle took a shower soon after his cousin 's death , potentially washing off evidence before police could examine him .
Suttle 's 911 call also raised eyebrows when he yelled : " Stevie !
The glass , the glass !
Wait , wait .
That 's glass . "
" If the defendant and the victim were the only two present at the time that telephone call was made , why would the defendant make a comment like , ' Wait wait that 's glass ? ' " said Chief John Dickey .
Many in the small town of Pulaski believed Suttle was guilty , even some members of his own family .
But it was medical examiner Dr. Charles Harlan who seemed to seal Suttle 's fate .
Harlan laid out the critical timeline :
The wound , he said , was inflicted shortly before death , and he testified that it was no accident .
Hobbs did n't die from a seizure or even a shard of glass , but from deliberate murder .
In the autopsy report , Harlan wrote that the cause of death was a stab wound .
" By examination of the wound , " he said , " we were able to determine that the wound was caused by an instrument " similar to a pair of scissors .
Harlan said he had " absolutely no question in [ his ] mind " that it was murder .
" That changed the entire complexion of the case , " said Judge Jim Hamilton , who presided over it .
" You 've got a homicide on your hands . "
Suttle 's Main Motive Believed to Be Money
For Dunavant , who was slowly putting together the prosecution 's case over months and months , it was all adding up .
" All of those things together pointed to the guilt of the defendant James Suttle , " he said .
" And there were simply no other suspects . "
Suttle was arrested for first - degree murder on Jan. 23 , 2001 .
With a means , motive and opportunity , the prosecution 's case against Suttle seemed unassailable .
Suttle hired lawyers Paul Bruno and Kerry Haymaker , who unlike almost everyone in Pulaski did n't understand what reason he would have to kill his cousin .
The prosecution felt the main motive was money -- pointing to $ 300 Suttle admitted to taking from his cousin 's pockets after his death -- but Suttle was well - positioned financially .
He made money in Las Vegas and had recently sold a new type of video poker game he helped develop .
" It did n't make any sense , " Haymaker said .
" We 're not talking about a lot of money . "
Juror : Suttle Painted as Gambler in Trial
During the trial , the prosecution attacked Suttle 's character , according to juror Carla Cobbs Parr .
" The fact that he was a poker player , you know , he lived in Nevada , [ they ] presented him as a gambler … a runaround I guess , " Parr said .
" You go , hmm .
Maybe depending on how deep into gambling he is , maybe there was something that just set him off . "
Since Suttle was the only person present at the time of Hobbs ' death , the dominating factor in the case was the medical examiner 's report by Harlan , which said Hobbs had been stabbed .
Jurors seemed to believe Harlan -- by then a 30 - year veteran who had testified thousands of times in his career .
Forensics Expert Comes to Suttle 's Rescue
With the jury seemingly leaning toward convicting Suttle , retired forensics anthropologist Bill Bass 's testimony turned the case upside down .
The renowned forensics expert , who created a new specialty of criminology investigation and typically testified for the prosecution , said something about the autopsy in Suttle 's case bothered him .
" I looked at the autopsy and what [ medical examiner Dr. Charles Harlan ] says in the autopsy happened could not happen , could not have happened , " said Bass , referring to the alleged stabbing of Hobbs by Suttle .
" But I do n't like to make statements like ' You ca n't do this ' unless I do a little research for it . "
Bass is also the founder of the " body farm , " a research facility located behind an unmarked gate in Knoxville , Tenn. , where human bodies are left unburied so scientists can study what happens to them over time .
" I went out to the body farm and used one of the bodies that we'd just gotten in and did an incision in the back , on the left - hand side , " he said .
Bass took a cadaver and a steel rod and tried to re-create the stab wound and the path of the stab wound as described by Harlan .
The results of Bass 's experiment completely contradicted Harlan 's testimony .
" What happened was that Dr. Bass , from the University of Tennessee , basically impeached the testimony of Dr. Harlan , " said Dunavant .
" We were blindsided . "
According to Bass , to get from the entry point on Hobbs ' back to the site of the wound on the right lung , a sharp instrument would have had to make a right - angle turn inside the body -- a maneuver Bass was not able to make using the steel rod .
" Physically it cannot be done , " Bass said .
" I 'm 100 percent , not 99 and 44/100 ths percent , I 'm 100 percent sure . "
Bass and a forensics colleague had gone even further .
They not only knew Suttle did not kill his cousin , they knew who did .
" About two weeks before he falls on the coffee table , [ Hobbs ] had been in a fight , " said Bass .
" They beat him up fairly bad .
And when you look at the autopsy , there 's a rib that is splintered in there .
And this rib is jabbing into the back of the lung and [ had ] taken about two weeks to kill him . "
Hobbs was literally a dead man walking , dying of injuries he sustained almost two weeks before his death .
Doctors said if Hobbs had sought medical attention at any time in the days after that fight , he would still be alive today .
Suttle Exonerated by Medically Impossible Murder
Before the jury read the verdict , Haymaker recalled thinking : " If this jury 's not going to return a not guilty on this case , then the whole system is just not worth anything .
...
If there were ever a case where someone was innocent and it was clearly demonstrated to a jury , this is it . "
A jury found Suttle not guilty .
Suttle told " 20/20 " that the words " innocent until proven guilty " have taken on a new meaning for him .
" I 've pretty much always felt the other way around , before this happened , " said Suttle .
" If you see somebody in court charged with a crime , the first thing you think is well , they 're guilty or they would n't be sitting here .
I mean why else would they have them up here in front of a jury ?
... I look at it differently now than I did before because I know what can happen .
It can happen to anyone .
It happened to me . "
How did things go so far ?
It would turn out that Harlan had been under investigation for years .
The details are unbelievable .
Suttle believes there are still other innocent men in prison because of Harlan 's testimonies .
Welwitschia mirabilis
" I 've heard everything between 1500 to 3000 years as an age estimate for the largest welwitschias , " says Sussman about these strange plants .
She photographed this example – probably around 2000 years old – in the Naukluft desert in Namibia .
" The welwitschias are strange and unique " she says .
" Surprisingly enough , they 're part of the conifer family and live only in the very specific climate along the coast of Namibia and Angola where coastal fog and desert meet . "
To capture moisture from sea fog , the welwitschia , also known as tree tumbo , has evolved special leaves .
These leaves become tattered and frayed with time – earning the plant the description of being " octopus - like " .
In addition , it has long tap roots that sip water deep underground and anchor the plant as it is buffeted by desert winds .
Its unusual appearance caused Friedrich Welwitsch , the botanist who discovered it for science in 1859 , to " do nothing but kneel down and gaze at it , half in fear lest a touch should prove it a figment of the imagination " .

Mojave yucca
This may look like a clump of many different plants – but each " ring " is actually a single individual .
This is the Mojave yucca ( Yucca schidigera ) , a plant that clones itself by sending out underground rhizomes that sprout into genetically identical stalks .
Each ring , which can be as large as 6 metres across , forms as old stalks in the centre age and die .
This particular specimen is probably over 12,000 years old , estimates Sussman .
Whilst most rings of Mojave yucca contain around five stalks , older plants can have 10 or more .
Also known as the Spanish dagger , the Mojave yucca is found only in the Mojave desert in the south - western US .
It grows at the leisurely rate of just 1 centimetre per year .

Llareta
This llareta plant , parts of which are over 3000 years old , calls Chile 's Atacama desert home .
Llaretas can be found throughout the Andes in Peru , Bolivia , Chile and Argentina .
A relative of parsley , its moss - like appearance belies thousands of flowering buds on long stems which are so densely packed together they can take the weight of a human .
" When I saw the llareta for the first time I immediately recognised it from photos I had seen , " says Sussman .
" Many of them dotted the hillside , some more strangely formed than others , sort of like mutated topiary on steroids . "
Because the llareta is dry and dense , it burns well , like peat .
" Its function as fuel is endangering its survival , as even park rangers charged with protecting it have been known to burn it to keep warm on cold nights . "

Bristlecone pine
Some of the bristlecone pines found in the White mountains of California are over 4500 years old .
A specimen known as The Old Man , is 4676 years .
Bristlecone pines receive very little water and food throughout the year : average annual rainfall in the White mountains is less than 30 centimetres , and the trees stand on dolomite , a form of limestone that contains few nutrients .
To survive on this ascetic diet , Pinus longaeva invests very little energy in growth .
As a result , they 're quite small despite their immense age – the tallest bristlecone is just 18 metres in height – and the trees ' girth increases by just 0.25 millimetres a year .
" It shuts down all its non-essential processes , " says Sussman .
" This looks half dead most of the time , perhaps with just one branch that appears to be alive . "

Today ’s poetic gem was penned rather beautifully by the late Jimi Hendrix on an unknown date , to a girlfriend he affectionately called ‘ little girl ’ .
It ’s all at once exceptionally sweet , gently encouraging and yet another example of the musician ’s effortless cool .
Even his handwriting sings .
Transcript follows .
Thanks to Jeff at Hard Rock for another wonderful letter .
As always , a visit to the Hard Rock Memorabilia website is recommended to all , and do n’t forget to pay them a visit on Facebook .

little girl ….. happiness is within you …. so unlock the chains from your heart and let yourself grow —
like the sweet flower you are …..
I know the answer —
Just spread your wings and set yourself
FREE Love to you forever Jimi Hendrix
( Mental Floss ) --
As the economy sputters , everyone 's looking for new ways to save on food .
So , we 've collected a whole bunch of no - budget meal ideas for those of you daring enough to scrimp .
1 . Tree bark
A classic meal of human desperation , tree bark has become a must - have during periods of scarcity .
But you do n't have to eat it al dente the way termites and beavers do .
Inhabitants of the Lapland in Finland , for example , are known to make bread with ground tree bark during cruel winter months , and several Native American groups use tree bark as a dietary supplement .
In fact , the Adirondack Mountains derive their name from a derisive term for the Algonquin Indians that means " tree eaters . "
Not all bark is equally edible , so you 'll have to experiment with your neighborhood flora .
Some popular favorites include aspen , birch , willow , maple , and pine -- trees common in cities and forests alike .
So sharpen your teeth and dig in !
How to prepare
For the choicest strips of bark , be sure to go for the nutritious , tender inner layer known as the cambium .
( Eating the outer bark would be no more pleasant than chomping into your bookshelf . )
If some resin or gum oozes out as you pry off the main course , be sure to lap it up for quick energy .
Here are a few fun ways to serve tree bark :
Raw .
Shred finely and chew thoroughly .
Slice it into strips and boil it to make a rustic pasta .
Top with sap , dandelion greens , or insect parts ( see entry # 2 ) .
Alternatively , you can add the noodles to a stew .
Dry and grind into flour .
The ground bark is pretty versatile and can be mixed with water into a breakfast gruel , baked into bread , added to soup for extra body , or even guzzled straight like Pixy Stix .
Mental Floss : Genius of the ' Joy of Cooking '
2. Bugs
With more than 10 quintillion of these creepy crawlies infesting the planet , bugs are a virtually limitless source of protein and flavor .
Bug eating exists in nearly every culture ; in fact , approximately 10 percent of the protein consumed around the world comes from bugs !
There are grasshopper tacos , steamed ant eggs , and even fried tarantulas .
In the United States , the FDA permits a limited quantity of insect parts in commercial foods , such as five fly maggots per pound of pizza sauce .
While most of our bug eating in this country is unintentional , it does n't have to be .
How to prepare
In general , avoid brightly colored bugs , which tend to be ( poisonous , and always be sure to remove any shells , wings , or other textural offenses .
Also , cook them before eating , to kill off the inevitable parasites .
Beyond that , each bug has its own qualities to consider .
Here are a few of the more traditional cooking methods :
Crickets and grasshoppers :
First , pluck off the barbed legs , because they can chafe your digestive tract .
Then , roast the body for a snack that 's both crunchy and nutritious .
Ants : Boil for 6 minutes to neutralize the formic acid of the stingers .
After that , inhale them by the handful .
Caterpillars :
They can give you a mouthful of tiny hairs , like licking a kiwi , so bite off the heads and then squeeze the insides into a pot .
Boil and serve warm .
Worms :
The dirt from the insides must be removed before they can be eaten .
This can be done by starving them for one day , or squeezing out the dirt by hand .
3. Leather
Transforming your wardrobe into your pantry is simple .
Shoes , jackets , and biker pants make meals both fashionable and filling .
In fact , in every era , leather has been enjoyed by the starving masses .
Indomitable explorers , stranded pirates , famine - stricken peasants , and even emaciated prisoners have downed a shoe or two .
Just two years ago , when Chinese miners in Beijing were trapped underground for nearly a week , they survived on nothing but pieces of paper and a leather belt .

How to prepare
Before cooking , rinse and dice the ( preferably undyed ) leather , then pound the pieces between stones to tenderize .
For a satisfying soup , you can boil the leather until relatively tender , then add seasonings such as dried worms and nettles .
Leather can also be chopped up and roasted to make nutritious chips .
And remember to drink plenty of water ; leather 's generally dry as a bone .
4. Dirt
No matter how bad the economy gets , there will always be enough dirt to go around .
Soil can provide essential minerals .
Think of it as a no- budget replacement for your expensive multivitamin supplements .
In fact , dirt eating , known as geophagy , is so prevalent in some parts of the world that scientists and anthropologists think that nutritional deficits may bring on the craving .
Even in the modern United States , reports persist that poor and rural Southerners still indulge in select soils by the spoonful , a custom that may have been brought over from West Africa .
How to prepare
The secret to good dirt eating is simply to choose wisely .
Soil that is rich in clay tastes the best , and it can be enhanced by adding salt and vinegar .
When you find a good source , save some in a plastic bag so you can snack on it all day long .
Of course , if you 're looking to enjoy the original mud pie , garnishing the meal with a few worms never hurts .

If only it were that simple .
The Times has extensive written ethics guidelines because even the best and most honorable journalists can find themselves in awkward circumstances that can affect their credibility  and the newspaper ’s  with a public that has little trust in journalists .
In this case , the guidelines stop far short of dictating what should be done .
They say that if a family member ’s activities create even the appearance of a conflict of interest , it should be disclosed to editors , who must then decide whether the staffer should avoid certain stories or even be reassigned to a different beat .
Keller said that if Israel launched a new assault into Gaza and Bronner ’s son were a foot soldier , “ I do n’t think I ’d have any problem with Ethan covering the conflict . ”
It would be a tougher call if the son rose to a commanding role , he said , and if the son ’s unit were accused of wrongdoing , Keller said he thought he would assign another reporter .
I asked David K. Shipler , a Pulitzer Prize - winning author , what he would do .
Shipler was The Times ’s Jerusalem bureau chief a generation ago and its chief diplomatic correspondent until he left the paper in 1988 .
He said foreign correspondents operate in far more nuanced circumstances than readers may realize .
They may rely on translators and stringers with political ties or biases that have to be accounted for .
They develop their own relationships that enrich their reporting , just as Bronner ’s son ’s military service could open a conduit for information that other reporters might not have .
“ There are always two questions , ” Shipler said .
“ One is whether there is an actual conflict ; the other is whether there is the appearance of a conflict .
Given the high quality of Bronner ’s reporting , I do n’t see an actual conflict . ”
He said he thought Bronner should remain in his post and The Times should disclose the situation .
Keller and Bronner responded freely to my questions , but the paper has otherwise been tight - lipped so far .
Alex Jones , director of Harvard ’s Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy and a former Pulitzer Prize - winning reporter for The Times , took a different view .
“ The appearance of a conflict of interest is often as important or more important than a real conflict of interest , ” he said .
“ I would reassign him . ”
Jones said such a step would be an injustice to Bronner , “ but the newspaper has to come first . ”
There are so many considerations swirling around this case : Bronner is a superb reporter .
Nobody at The Times wants to give in to what they see as relentlessly unfair criticism of the paper ’s Middle East coverage by people hostile to objective reporting .
It does n’t seem fair to hold a father accountable for the decision of an adult son .
Citrix has been demonstrating Windows 7 running on an iPad , as a dumb client at least , while a Finn has hacked OSX to the N900 for no very good reason .
Images of Apple 's iPad running Windows 7 have been floating around the internet thanks to Citrix , which has got its dumb- terminal Windows client running for the BOFH who wants to wander around annoying Mac fans .
Meanwhile , a Finnish hacker has created a port of OSX ( 10.3 ) for the Nokia N900 , which ( thanks to judicious use of hardware emulation ) takes well over an hour to boot .
Putting Windows on the iPad is little short of insane , but Citrix already has dumb - client software running on the iPhone so the fact that it works rather well on the iPad is no great surprise .
It 's such a niche application that even Citrix is polling on its blog to see if anyone really wants it , but more importantly , it provides screenshots of Windows running on an iPad which certainly catch the eye :
Windows 7 via Citrix Receiver and XenDesktop 4
That 's an emulator of course ; even Citrix does n't have any real hardware yet , but the idea of a light wireless pad Windows remote control is attractive ; so attractive that it 's been tried before , in the form of Windows Sideshow and various preceding technologies that promised to take the windows desktop onto a slate - like device .
But the iPad is probably the hardware best suited , even if it's not quite what Steve Jobs had in mind for his latest baby .
It 's also safe to say that OSX is n't the operating system Nokia had in mind for the Linux - based N900 tablet phone , but that has n't stopped Toni Nikkanen using hardware emulation to get the Apple OS running on it despite the fast that getting to the " About my Mac " screen now takes a couple of hours as the following ( heavily edited ) video demonstrates :
Pointless technology is , to our mind , the best technology , and both these projects are pretty pointless .
But it is possible that remote access to Windows 7 from an iPad will appeal to some , while no one is really going to wait two hours to see their N900 running OSX .
So today 's award for the most pointless OS port has to go to Mr Nikkanen - though even he is some way off from our all time winner : ZX81 emulation on the ZX80 , which takes some beating . ®
Women are being prevented from taking part in a two - day conference on male suicide rates .
The conference , with more than 100 participants from around New Zealand , features male - only guest speakers .
Wairarapa suicide prevention coordinator Barry Taylor said women were excluded to encourage men to take responsibility for their own mental health .
" Men 's mental health has been a hidden subject over many years .
Part of the problem is that they do n't talk about their feelings and they do n't ask for help . "
Mr Taylor said some women had asked to be part of the conference but were told no .
" So often men have delegated their emotional issues on to the women in their lives .
It is vital that ... we take responsibility for dealing with the issues . "
Female members of the media and Wairarapa District Health Board 's communications team have been given permission to attend the event , which begins in Masterton today .
The National Council of Women supported the decision , saying it was about participants feeling they could open up .
The Human Rights Commission said there was nothing illegal or discriminatory in the way the conference was being promoted or held .
" With discrimination you have to suffer detriment .
It seems very unlikely that a woman who could n't go would experience loss .
Girl Guides and Boy Scouts limit membership to gender and there is nothing in the Human Rights
Act that limits that , " spokesman Gilbert Wong said .
Mr Taylor said the focus should be on the purpose of the conference .
" Statistics show the urgency of the problem of depression , often fuelled by relationship breakups , alcohol and drug abuse , crime and antisocial behaviours .
More than 500 people die by suicide every year but it is New Zealand men who are three times more likely to kill themselves than women across all ages and races .
" Men were more reluctant to seek help or may dismiss the seriousness of their problem , he said .
More than 10 guest speakers from New Zealand , Australia and the Netherlands will talk on topics including violence , men 's health and child advocacy during the two - day conference .
Since the founding of their church 131 years ago , Christian Scientists have been taught to avoid doctors at all cost .
It is a conviction rooted so deeply in church dogma that dozens of members have endured criminal prosecution rather than surrender an ailing person to what they see as the quackery of medical science .
But faced with dwindling membership and blows to their church ’s reputation caused by its intransigence concerning medical treatment , even for children with grave illnesses , Christian Science leaders have recently found a new tolerance for medical care .
For more than a year , leaders say , they have been encouraging members to see a physician if they feel it is necessary .
Perhaps more significantly , they have begun a public campaign to redefine their methods as a form of care that the broader public should consider as a supplement rather than a substitute for conventional treatment , like biofeedback , chiropractic or homeopathic care .
In recent years , the church has been lobbying to convince lawmakers that its approach is an alternative way of tending to the sick , and that its costs should be covered by insurance companies and included in health care legislation .
PARIS 
The unemployment rate in the euro zone hit double digits in November for the first time in more than a decade , tempering hopes for a rapid recovery in the job market .
Eurostat , the European Union ’s statistics agency , said on Friday that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the 16 countries that use the euro rose to 10 percent in November , from 9.9 percent in October and 8 percent in November 2008 .
For the euro area , the rate was the highest rate since 1998 , a year before the euro was introduced .
The number of unemployed in November rose by 102,000 , still a significant pace of increase although down from the monthly peak of 475,000 seen at the start of last year .
The unemployment rate for the broader 27 - member European Union was 9.5 percent in November , from 9.4 percent in October and 7.5 percent in November 2008 .
Their recent success also means they are slowly closing in on some of the other bad teams in the East .
They are only four points behind the Lightning , the Hurricanes , and the Islanders ; five points behind the Panthers ; seven points behind the Rangers ; and nine points behind the Thrashers .
Gaining the points to surpass the Rangers and Thrashers is doubtful , but the Leafs play both teams twice before the end of the season , so it is n’t totally outlandish .
Another thing that works in the Leafs favour is that most of the teams they need to pass play in the horrible Southeast Division ( which by the way must be considered when judging just how good the Capitals are ) .
It ’s likely that most of these teams will beat each other and no one will really gain too much ground during the stretch .
If one gains a lot of points it will probably be at the expense of another , thus making it likely the Leafs can pass someone .
Listed below are the opponents for the non-playoff teams in the East .
Leafs – Panthers ( H ) , Thrashers ( A ) , Rangers ( H ) , Pens ( A ) , Thrashers ( H ) , Sabres ( H ) , Bruins ( H ) , Flyers ( H ) , Rangers ( A ) , Habs ( A )
Lightning – Hurricanes ( H ) , Bruins ( A ) , Sabres ( A ) , Blue Jackets ( A ) , Pens ( A ) , Rangers ( H ) , Hurricanes ( H ) , Sens ( H ) , Panthers ( H ) , Panthers ( A )
Islanders – Rangers ( A ) , Flames ( H ) , Blue Jackets ( A ) , Rangers ( H ) , Flyers ( H ) , Sens ( H ) , Habs ( H ) , Pens ( A ) , Devils ( A ) , Pens ( H )
Hurricanes – Lightning ( A ) , Caps ( H ) , Thrashers ( H ) , Thrashers ( A ) , Habs ( A ) , Sens ( A ) , Devils ( H ) , Lightning ( A ) , Habs ( H ) , Bruins ( A )
Panthers – Leafs ( A ) , Habs ( A ) , Sens ( A ) , Preds ( H ) , Sabres ( A ) , Bruins ( A ) , Rangers ( H ) , Sens ( H ) , Devils ( H ) , Lightning ( A ) , Lightning ( H )
Rangers – Islanders ( H ) , Devils ( A ) , Leafs ( A ) , Islanders ( A ) , Lightning ( A ) , Panthers ( A ) , Sabres ( A ) , Leafs ( H ) , Flyers ( H ) , Flyers ( A ) ,
Thrashers – Bruins ( H ) , Leafs ( H ) , Hurricanes ( A ) , Hurricanes ( H ) , Leafs ( A ) , Caps ( A ) , Pens ( A ) , Devils ( H ) , Caps ( A ) , Pens ( H )
A few things jump out about those schedules .
First , the Islanders have the toughest by far .
They play six games against playoff teams and two against teams playing for their playoff lives .
If any team is to tank down the stretch it ’s definitely the Islanders .
Second , the Rangers face a brutal six game road trip before facing the Leafs at home .
Analysts always say the hardest game to win is the first one back at home after a lengthy road trip .
I like the sounds of that for the Leafs .
Other than that everyone just plays each other .
The Leafs just need to play well and hope there are a few teams that falter down the stretch .
The Rangers and Thrashers are out of reach , so let ’s just hope they do any sort of beatings needed .
Does any of this really matter ?
Gaining ground over the next few weeks wo n’t provide any material benefit for the Leafs .
They do n’t own their first round pick as a result of the Phil Kessel deal , so whether they win or lose the remaining games has no physical consequence .
However , escaping the basement of the East will reduce the odds of the Bruins drafting a superstar and , more importantly , will placate the psyche of Leafs Nation .
Since the Bruins are in the same division as the Leafs it benefits the Leafs to make sure a worse pick falls to the Bruins .
Being terrorized six games a year by someone the Bruins drafted with a Leafs pick does n’t sound enjoyable to me .
It ’s bad enough seeing Tuukka Rask turn into the best goalie in the league .
The Leafs need to win enough games before the end of the year to remove their former pick from the draft lottery .
If it ’s a lottery pick it will certainly win the draw and become the first overall pick .
I ’m positive .
That ’s going to be hard to take considering Leafs fans have wanted the team to tank out for a better draft pick for at least the past two years .
It would be cruel if the year it actually happens is the same year they do n’t actually own a first round pick .
Seeing this happen would also look bad for Brian Burke .
Burke maintains he would make the Phil Kessel trade again if he had the chance , but losing the first overall pick would be a disaster .
Kessel is certainly looking great as a Leaf and I fully support the trade .
He ’s in his early 20s and looks like a 30 - 40 goal scorer .
That ’s pretty good .
( There ’s an interesting piece over at
Whatever , we ’re due for a bust in the top - 3 picks , right ?

That ’s pretty good .
( There ’s an interesting piece over at Maple Leafs Hot Stove that compares Kessel to other young forwards which looks pretty good on Kessel . )
Whether he ’s going to be better than two first round picks and a second is hard to say because at this point we do n’t know who those picks will be .
But the trade will certainly look much better and feel much better if the Bruins draft someone at the sixth spot rather than the first .
Whatever , we ’re due for a bust in the top - 3 picks , right ?
Since the lockout the Leafs have made a yearly habit of turning it on over the last few months of the season , which is usually when they ’re almost assured to miss the playoffs .
Over the past five years the Leafs record is 54 - 38 - 8 after February .
If they played at the same pace over the course of a full season they would record around 95 points .
That ’s good enough to secure a low playoff seed in the Eastern Conference .
Unfortunately , these brief moments of success are responsible for a modest climb in the standings , which result in worse draft positions , something dreaded by the former Tank Nation .
This year the Leafs are 9 - 6 - 1 since February .
They ’ve won 3 in a row and 6 of their last 7 .
They are still in last place in the Eastern Conference , but not by much .
Technically , they ’re still alive for the playoffs , although , realistically they certainly are n’t .
But it ’s pretty amazing that a team that ’s played as poorly as the Leafs have are only 12 points behind the eighth placed team .
Is nobody else winning games in the Eastern Conference ?
We mentioned this yesterday , but now , after two days at this year 's Pwn2 Own browser - hacking competition , Chrome alone stands unhacked ; hackers infiltrated every other browser on day one .
Perhaps the best indicator of Chrome 's security is the fact that competitors have n't even attempted to crack Chrome 's " sandbox " despite a $ 10,000 prize .
Chrome gives every process started within the browser very limited privileges to get the job done , keeping it essentially in the sandbox , so while it 's possible to get in the sandbox , you can't do very much while you 're there .
It seems like this bodes extremely well for Chrome 's security system , especially compared to its competition — and it'll likely give more people reason to choose Chrome over Firefox .

BY JEFF DEENEY
So late last week the flash mob story broke national , and the middle class is freaking out about poor black teens using new technologies to organize riots that threaten white business districts , even though now it seems there was never a flash mob to begin with .
You ’ve heard all kinds of commentary from a thousand white journalists who have never spoken to black teenagers in the neighborhoods except maybe when taking statements in court for a story , and seen bloggers who are equally distanced from urban poverty jumping in front of cameras to play expert I guess because they have an Internet connection .
You ’re probably sick of reading about the flash mobs by now , and I understand that this commentary is late in coming .
But the difference between what you ’re about to read and what you ’ve been reading is that I know what I ’m talking about when it comes to how new technologies have taken hold in the neighborhoods I ’ve spent a lot of time working in over the last few years .
In the spring of 2007 I stood in the living room of a run down row house on D Street , one of the roughest streets in North Philly ’s Badlands , and watched one of my young clients obsessively updating his Myspace page .
His family was so poor they did n’t even have much furniture and they were always behind on rent but the boy had hustled up enough money to get a computer that he connected to a $ 10 per month Internet connection , a special deal for poor families offered by Verizon .
“ He ’s always on that damn computer , ” his mother croaked from where she sat on their ragged couch watching daytime talk shows .
“ It broke down last week and he stole a shopping cart from the super market and pushed it all the way across town to get it fixed , he needs it that bad .
He ’s missing school , up all night on the Internet , but there ai n’t nothing I can do about it . ”
Honestly , she was n’t trying very hard to do much about it .
Drug addicted and mentally ill , she had provided little guidance for the boy , or her two other kids .
I guess she was doing the best she could ; I ’m sure many would disagree with that , though .
Later that same year I sat having lunch with another young client at the McDonalds on 2nd and Lehigh in the same Badlands neighborhood .
A quiet , sullen kid , he sat mostly not speaking , staring at a Jay - Z video playing on his iPod .
“ Who put that on there for you , ” I asked .
I knew he was stone - cold illiterate , a high school drop out who had already done juvenile time on a gun charge .
There was no way he knew how to operate a computer well enough to load the video himself .
“ For five dollars a week my cousin makes me a mix , ” he said .
That ’s a great hustle , I thought .
His young cousin probably made good money keeping his less computer - savvy friends up on hot new rap videos .
He was probably one of the few kids in the neighborhood who knew how to use the technology .
I ’ve done social work in Philadelphia public schools ; I worked in Bartram High , in the same violent Southwest Philly neighborhood where the papers reported about 11 year old kids playing a violent game called “ Catch and Wreck ” that involves brutally beating people who appear to be homeless .
Bartram High , a crumbling and decrepit facility , had a “ computer lab ” with six aged Dell laptops for almost 2000 kids to use .
Actually , only about half of those kids showed up on any given day , but still .
Over time I heard about other similar black market enterprises run by early adopters in the ghetto ; a young kid who knows how to use torrents and Photoshop churns out pro-quality DVD bootlegs and becomes sought out by the whole neighborhood because his boots are n’t that shaky cam shit shot in the theater that everyone ’s used to .
By summer of 2008 social networking sites like Myspace and Blackplanet became not just places to chat with the neighborhood girls but places to gather to celebrate neighborhood affiliations .
Students in the public schools bragged back and forth , beefing with the kids across town about which school is tops .
Corner kids started discussion forums dedicated to singing the praises of their corner drug crews whose teenage members proudly posted pictures of themselves on their pages pointing handguns at the camera , flashing fat stacks of rubber banded bills and piles of bagged up drugs .
One particularly wild crew , the Erie Avenue Mob out of North Philly ’s Simon Gratz High School , had their own custom made logo – the city skyline with two Uzis crossed under it like an “ X ” – and a group inviting other kids in their school to “ Join the Mob . ”
The School District denied that corner drug crews were using social networking sites to recruit in the schools , stating they were blocked on the school ’s networks .
But it was clear that nonetheless more kids were getting online outside of school and the power of the web was bringing together more kids with dysfunctional backgrounds in poor , urban neighborhoods than ever before .
Sometimes the results were positive and constructive , sometimes they were n’t .
By 2009 the new must have status symbol was no longer an iPod packed with hot video mixes .
The new must have item , like Air Jordans or a leather jacket once upon a time , is the smartphone .
Now in the neighborhoods it ’s all about the IPhone , the Blackberry , the Droid .
That ’s how the kids in class know you ’re gettin ’ money : you got a flashy new phone loaded with a Twitter app and monthly data plan .
Everyone you know knows where you ’re at and what you ’re up to anywhere you ’re at .
It ’s an odd status symbol in a lot of ways ; to whites in the corporate world the Blackberry is often seen as a sort of albatross that tethers you eternally to the office and many resent this new superconnectivity that can keep them working around the clock .
It should n’t come as a surprise to anybody that when white people from healthy , nurturing families who have enjoyed the benefit of all the functional social institutions that come with privilege organize for a flash mob it ’s an impromptu pillow fight and when newly networked black teens raised in dysfunctional families , deprivation and failing social institutions plan a flash mob it results in a crowd of angry boys beating on car hoods and chanting “ burn the city . ”
I think this stark difference highlights a lot about our intensely unequal society .
But was there even a flash mob ?
When the story first broke I spent hours scouring Twitter and Facebook looking for evidence of a trail I could track back to those calling for a flash mob , and could n’t find it .
I was able to find exactly on Twitter feed whose user mentioned getting texts about going to South Street , which , on the first warm Saturday night of the year , most kids would have done anyway .
Now Gawker has reported that the flash mob was nothing more than performances by couple dance troupes that got out of control .
The fact that the police department was calling it a flash mob organized on social networking sites should have been taken with a grain of salt because anyone who ’s worked with the department knows that your average Philly cop is CAPS LOCK GUY who still has an AOL account , is n’t exactly up on new trends online , and might not be the most reliable source for this kind of information .
Days after the South Street flash mob , alerts went out from UPenn warning of another flash mob to form on 40th Street .
The flash mob turned out to be a couple hundred white journalists with notepads and video cameras hoping for a mob of black teens to show up and act all ignorant .
But , not surprisingly , the Philly papers ran with the “ flash mob ” story for more than a week despite lack of evidence that there was a trend at work because it got them link arounds and page views despite the fact that the whole thing smelled like bullshit from the beginning .
The newspaper ’s job is to critically analyze information from law enforcement sources , not parrot it because it ’s sexy and results in page view spikes , but , hey , I understand they ’re in a tough spot right now when it comes to money .
So there you have it , a brief history of how we got to where we are today with respect to poor kids and how they use the Internet , and how it may or may not have lead to the Great Flash Mob Scare of 2010 .
Let ’s hope for the sake of white people in suburbs everywhere that poor kids do n’t continue to use new technologies to organize gatherings outside their own neighborhoods .
And let ’s also hope that if they do , at least they act real crazy so that newspaper reporters can continue to have more material for their stories about the disturbing new “ flash mob ” trend that is sweeping the city .

Infantino recalled more than 1 million baby slings after three children suffocated , the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday .
Consumers should stop using the SlingRider and Wendy Bellissimo slings for children younger than 4 months and contact San Diego - based Infantino for a free replacement , the agency said .
The commission said it ’s aware of deaths in Philadelphia , Cincinnati and Salem , Ore. , last year .
“ Do not attempt to fix these carriers , ” the agency said .
The commission said in a March 12 statement that it was investigating 14 deaths associated with baby slings in the last 20 years , though the statement did n’t name specific brands .
Young babies are at risk of suffocation because they have less motor control of their heads .
The safety commission said the products were made in China and Thailand and were sold from January 2003 through March 2010 at retailers including Wal - Mart , Target , Amazon.com , Burlington Coat Factory , Toys R Us and its Babies R Us locations .
Infantino has been working with regulators and ASTM International , a nonprofit standard - writing organization , over baby - sling safety concerns , said Jack Vresics , president of the company .
Government ad running on British radio station tells public to report people who close their curtains as potential suicide bombers
Paul Joseph Watson

Thursday , March 11 , 2010
A new government commercial currently running on one of Britain ’s most popular radio stations is selling one thing – fear – by encouraging Londoners to report their neighbors as terrorists if they use cash , enjoy their privacy , or even close their curtains .
The advertisement , produced in conjunction with national radio outlet TallkSport , promotes the “ anti- terrorist hotline ” and encourages people to report individuals who do n’t talk to their neighbors much , people who like to keep themselves to themselves , people who close their curtains , and people who do n’t use credit cards .
“ This may mean nothing , but together it could all add up to you having suspicions , ” states the voice on the ad , before continuing “ We all have a role to play in combating terrorism ” ( we ’re all indentured stasi informants for the government ) .
“ If you see anything suspicious , call the confidential anti-terrorist hotline …. if you suspect it , report it , ” concludes the commercial .
Listen to the ad below .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
That ’s right , if you are trying to stay out of debt by not having a credit card , you ’re obviously a prime candidate to be a suicide bomber .
If you ’re watching television or using a computer monitor and want to keep the sun off the screen by closing your curtains , you ’re probably operating at the behest of Osama bin Laden .
If you ’d rather not let the entire neighborhood know your business then you could be planning to hijack planes and crash them into buildings .
Of course , the sheer lunacy of this commercial on the face of it does n’t need to be explained in any depth .
What ’s infinitely more disturbing is the deeper message the government is trying to force upon the public – that everyone has a responsibility to act as a citizen spy , a Stasi informant working for the state , and that everyone is under constant suspicion no matter how apparently benign their behavior .
This has nothing to do with catching non-existent terrorists and everything to do with creating the perception that anyone who attempts to live their life even marginally outside of the system , by not having a credit card for example , is a potential danger to the rest of the sheep who have chosen to remain firmly inside the confines of the pen .
This is about getting the other inmates to police any other prisoner who dares to step outside the boundary of the cell .
Another aspect is the accelerating attempt to create a cashless society where every transaction is tracked and recorded .
To predominantly eliminate the use of cash , it has to be demonized as suspicious , dirty and criminal .
People who have been reading this website will know that we have tracked the evolution of these kind of campaigns with increasing horror at their resemblance to the darkest days of Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany .
Similar previous “ anti- terror ” campaigns have featured posters that imply people who get refunds , live in apartments , or drive vans should be reported .
Does that sound incredible ?
It ’s true , the London Metropolitan Police actually ran a campaign encouraging people to report individuals as potential terrorists because they had a home , under the slogan , “ Terrorists need places to live .
Are you suspicious of your tenants or neighbors ? ”
A more recent campaign encouraged citizens to study the contents of each others ’ trash and report anything suspicious , as well as to grass up individuals who glanced at the millions of CCTV cameras that line every major street in the country .
Staring back at big brother is a sign of terrorism , according to the British government .
People who use mobile phones , cameras and computers were also labeled suspected terrorists .
As America and Britain sink deeper into militarized police states , society begins to parallel more and more aspects of Nazi Germany , especially in the context of citizens being turned against each other , which in turn creates a climate of fear and the constraining sense that one is always being watched .
One common misconception about Nazi Germany was that the police state was solely a creation of the authorities and that the citizens were merely victims .
On the contrary , Gestapo files show that 80 % of all Gestapo investigations were started in response to information provided by denunciations by “ ordinary ” Germans .
“ There were relatively few secret police , and most were just processing the information coming in .
I had found a shocking fact .
It was n’t the secret police who were doing this wide - scale surveillance and hiding on every street corner .
It was the ordinary German people who were informing on their neighbors , ” wrote Robert Gellately of Florida State University .
Gellately discovered that the people who informed on their neighbors were motivated primarily by banal factors – “ greed , jealousy , and petty differences , ” and not by a genuine concern about crime or insecurity .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Gellately “ found cases of partners in business turning in associates to gain full ownership ; jealous boyfriends informing on rival suitors ; neighbors betraying entire families who chronically left shared bathrooms unclean or who occupied desirable apartments . ”
“ And then there were those who informed because for the first time in their lives someone in authority would listen to them and value what they said . ”
Gellately emphasizes the fact that the Germans who sicked the authorities on their neighbors knew very well what the consequences for the victims would be – families torn apart , torture and internment in concentration camps , and ultimately in many cases death – but they still did it with few qualms because the rewards of financial bounties and mere convenience were deemed more important to them .
This strikes at the root of the selfish and childish urges the government is trying to manipulate in getting people to report on their neighbors .
The self - important feeling of being listened to , ascribed some temporary sense of authority , and the cult - like pavlovian reward of being metaphorically patted on the head by someone in a uniform , are all tendencies such campaigns play on .
However , if we do n’t want to end up in a society that exists in a constant state of tyranny and fear as in Stasi East Germany or Stalinist Russia , we must learn that our neighbors are not our enemies , and that the only real threat against which we need to unite is an oppressive state that tries to destroy us by turning us against each other .

Massif Visualizer - Ready for Testers and Feedback !
memory consumption overview
Hello everyone !
In my opinion , the massif visualizer is ready for testing .
I bet there are still a few rough edges , but the most important features are in .
So if you are going to do any memory profiling these days , please take a look at my tool and give me feedback .
I ’d be especially interested in whether the massif visualizer helps in the work flow to analyze massif data files .
My personal work flow so far is the following :
callgraph of detailed massif snapshot
generate massif log , one way or the other ( unit tests preferred since they give you reproducible test cases ) open log in massif - visualizer , look at overall consumption chart 1 . how does the memory consumption evolve ?
is there a memleak ?
2 . are there designated peaks which could be reduced ?
3 . are there any ( significant ) contributions to the memory consumption , that needlessly stay over the whole application life ?
to find the actual culprits in code and / or to grasp the composition of a memory peak , use the detailed snapshot analysis
I wonder how I could improve the tool to also help with verifying that a fix helps , e.g. by either overlaying two charts or by only showing the difference .
The problem here is of course that it would only work with reproducible test cases and that it needs interpolation since the snapshots are taken at random points in time .
Still , it would be nice to open two massif logs and seeing the impact on memory consumption of a patch visually .
Note :
To anyone interested : I generate the callgraphs by converting the massif snapshot trees into a graphviz DOT file .
That one I than visualize with KGraphViewer KPart .
Since KGraphViewer was in no shape to visualize the huge amount of data in my use case , I had to optimize it greatly and push in some more features to make it better suitable for thirdparty users .
To integrate it better , I had to write a public interface , which also means that you need KGraphViewer installed from source to be able to compile Massif Visualizer ( I ’ll make it optional later on ) .
Hence get the sources from here ( packages by your distributor wo n’t be enough ) : http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/extragear/graphics/kgraphviewer/
KIEL , Germany -
What its makers say is the world 's biggest boat powered by the sun has been unveiled in Germany ahead of its planned circumnavigation of the globe next year - the first under solar power .
" This is a unique feeling to see in front of me today a boat which I so often dreamed about , " Raphael Domjan , the boat 's future skipper and initiator of the project , said on Thursday .
' PlanerSolar ' , which makers say is the world 's biggest boat powered by the sun .
The sleek , 31 metre by 15 metre catamaran PlanetSolar , 35 metres by 23 metres when flaps at the stern and the sides are included , will be " silent and clean " , say its makers , also called PlanetSolar .
The vessel will be able to achieve a top speed of about 15 knots , equivalent to 25 km/h , and can accommodate 50 people on its round - the - world voyage , its Swiss - based makers say .
Billy & Joseph III -- let 's leave the legacy crap to the Republicans
“ If he runs , he is immediately the front - runner , ’’ said state Senator Robert O’Leary , Democrat of Barnstable , who said he would run for the seat if Delahunt retires .
“ From my perspective if Kennedy enters the race , it obviously changes the dynamic and makes it more difficult .
But it would not change my decision . ’’
One potential hurdle , however , is the political climate in the state , and especially in that district , which went heavily for Republican Scott Brown in last month ’s Senate election .
If Kennedy were to run and win his party ’s nomination , he could risk become a lightning rod for the newly energized conservatives from around the country who poured millions of dollars into Brown ’s coffers .
With no member of the family ever losing an election in Massachusetts , he would be putting the Kennedy legacy on the line .
... Democratic political consultant Michael Shea , who has worked for Delahunt in two campaigns , including his first election in 1996 , said that Joseph Kennedy ’s presence in the race should give pause to potential Democratic candidates .
“ Any time a Kennedy gets into a race , everybody better think twice , ’’ said Shea .
“ That is particularly true if the field is crowded . ’’
“ You are running against history , against a legacy , while at the same time you are out there trying to tell people who you are , ’’ Shea said .
“ The Kennedy name has immediate cache with Democrats . ’’
I 've always hated entitlement based on anything other than merit .
I was delighted that Illinois Republicans put an end to the whole concept of a Hastert dynasty last month , defeating his son Ethan 's bid to reclaim the family 's uber corrupt family business .
It 's a great shame that some of the most laughable and ineffectual members of Congress are offspring of former members .
Michael Bilirakis bequeathed his Tampa - area seat to his retarded son Gus. Connie Mack IV now holds a Ft. Myers - based seat that was represented by his father , Cornelius McGillicuddy III .
It 's hard to believe the clownish maneuverings in Miami - Dade between the Diaz - Balart Brothers to hold a House seat for the family while the other one asserts his absurd claims to the Cuban presidency .
And that 's just Florida !
Here in California , another mentally deficient son , Duncan Hunter , Jr. , took over a suburban congressional seat from his sleazy father , Duncan Hunter , Sr. The Senate has 5 offspring of better qualified fathers : Mark Pryor ( D - AR ) , Bob Bennett ( R- UT ) , Lisa Murkowski ( R - AK ) , Evan Bayh ( D - IN ) , and Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) .
Over on the other side of the Capitol , the Frelinghuysens do n't only have their own New Jersey county ; they seem to own a House seat as well !
The current Lord Rodney is the great - great - great - great - grandson of Frederick Frelinghuysen , who was a member of the Continental Congress and served in the Senate in the 1790s .
There were 4 others in between , including the current backbencher 's corrupt father , Peter .
Currently Taze Shepard is trying to win a Democratic primary in northern Alabama based on his direct descent from Grandpa Senator John Sparkman , a connection most people would be ashamed to admit .
And then there 's the legendary Kennedys .
Democrats have been rending their clothes at the very idea that next year could see a Congress without a Kennedy .
I have nothing against them and I honor their service -- and Congress is perfectly capable of muddling along without them .
Patrick Kennedy ( D - RI ) did n't add much , to put it mildly , and even Robert Kennedy -- for whom I once worked -- had a distinctly mixed bag of accomplishments .
So now theis reporting that Joseph P. Kennedy III is mulling a run for a House seat William Delahunt is considering retiring from .
The 29 year old assistant D.A. is the son of a congressman ( Joseph II ) and , supposedly he's the " most promising " of his generation of Kennedys .
I 'm guessing the Kennedys will get Delahunt to stay in for another 2 year stint , let the kid get some accomplishments under his belt and then resign .
Meanwhile , if Democrats are serious about a Kennedy based on merit , Blue America endorsed Billy Kennedy from North Carolina this past weekend .
This one may not have the cache but he's one of us , not one of them and I have n't spoken to a better qualified Kennedy for elective office in my life .
In fact , he can use your help a lot more than any Massachusetts Kennedys .
If you 're feelin ' up to it today , please consider a contribution to his campaign here

Tecmo and Pieces Interactive have announced that their guitar - controlled musical platformer Fret Nice will land on the North American PlayStation Store this Thursday .
Not a whole hell of a lot is known about Fret Nice as of yet , the game revolves around the musical group The Vibrant Chordblasters and their band antithesis , the heavy - metal Häir Bangers .
The title includes co-op play and while it can be played with either a guitar peripheral or any standard controller , the dev stresses that it in no way should be considered a rhythm game .
Fret Nice can be downloaded via the PSN for $ 14.99 when the game launches this Thursday , February 4 .
The game is set for your Europe , as well as the Xbox Live Arcade , but those release dates have yet to be revealed .
Check out the trailer :

With Greek finances dragging down the euro , calls for coordinated fiscal policy within the common currency zone have become more frequent .
Now , Germany and France have presented a paper outlining what such a regime might look like .
Increased monitoring is at the top of the priority list .
Let me tell you a story .
Late last year , I concluded a three - year long Iron Heroes game .
It was a great campaign , but it was a lot of work , and not without its drama .
We parted company on good terms , but I was kind of happy to be out of that long - term relationship .
However , I am not the kind of GM to be without a game , so after a month , I was ready to get back into the GMing scene .
I started trolling for a new game .
That ’s when I met Witchcraft .
She was a lot different from Iron Heroes .
Her rules were looser , and far less complicated .
I decided to hook up with her , but nothing serious , no complicated stories , no long running arcs .
A simply casual game : a campaign with benefits .
Things with Witchcraft were going fine .
It was running smoothly , nice and simple .
The players were happy , I was happy .
Then Corporation came back into my life .
I met Corporation a year ago , back when I was running Iron Heroes .
She was from the UK , and had n’t made it to the US in hardcover form .
I was curious about her , so I did the next best thing and checked out her PDF on the Internet .
I definitely liked what I saw !
She seemed nice , but I was committed at the time .
I gave her a quick read .
It was innocent ; it never stole my focus from Iron Heroes .
This time , however , was different .
She was a new version , and was finally available on this side of the ocean .
We got to talking , and found out we had a lot in common .
We were both into post - cyberpunk settings ; we both loved simple but versatile rule sets ; and we both craved high - octane action .
it was a match made in Heaven .
One night when I was not working on Witchcraft , I ran a small Corporation game for some friends .
It went well .
My friends liked her .
I liked her .
I could easily see myself running with her for a while .
Right now I am still running Witchcraft , but lately , I ’ve begun to think about an end game , a way to end the campaign nicely .
I have talked to a few players about it , but not to the whole group … yet .
Then this morning , I could n’t help myself .
I went online and ordered Corporation ’s supplement .
I started jotting down some campaign notes .
There ’s something about her I just ca n’t shake .
So should I feel bad for Wichcraft ?
Naw , she was my Rebound Game .
Rules of the Rebound Game
The rebound game is a campaign that acts as a filler between your last serious campaign and your next one .
If you are like me , and you ca n’t be without a game to GM , you are going to have a rebound game .
It ’s OK .
Do n’t feel bad .
There are rules for this sort of thing .
Follow these rules and you will have a good time .
Keep it simple –
No matter what kind of game you just ended , your rebound game should be simple to run and not cause you too much hassle .
Pick either a familiar rule set , or one with a simple system .
Play the short game –
The rebound game is not likely to be one of your great campaigns .
Keep the plot lines simple .
No long term story arcs .
Keep plots to 1 - 4 sessions .
Do n’t get your players ’ hopes up –
Be clear to your players that this is a rebound game .
You do n’t want your players thinking that this may be their next big game .
Let them know that there is a good chance that this could be a short - term game .
Take it seriously – Just because this is a rebound , that does not mean that you should slack off on running it .
A good GM plays every game professionally .
Do n’t waste your players ’ time by running a game you are not taking seriously .
Learn something – Every time you run a campaign , you have a chance to learn something .
Your rebound game is no different .
Either during the game or at its end , make sure that you take the time to reflect .
Think of what you did well , and what could be improved .
Keep looking –
This is a rebound game , so as you are working on it , and running it , you should be looking at other games .
Keep your mind open and let it lead you to your next game .
Enjoy our rebound game , and let it be exactly what it is , the game before your next great game .
So have you had a rebound game before ?
What was her name , and how did it go ?
Students at
Ferris High School
in
Jersey City
were evacuated from the school this morning when a fire broke out there , students told The Jersey Journal .
A senior who did not want to be identified said a fire was set in the back of the school , in a garage , at about 10:30 .
Nine to 12 students were taken away by police , the student said .
" I witnessed them being taken by the cops , " the student said .
" They were smiling and laughing and even dancing . "
The student added that there is simmering hostilities between two groups in the school and that this act , if intentional , could be a result of that .
Jersey City Fire Director
Armando Roman
said his investigators on the scene are unaware of any students being taken into custody .
Calls to the high school were not answered and a message left for a district spokeswoman were not immediately returned .
" It was a small fire in the automotive room , " Roman said .
" We evacuated the school as a precaution because there was a lot of smoke . "
Nine members of a Christian militia group known as the Hutaree were arrested over the weekend in a series of FBI raids in Indiana , Michigan , and Ohio , on suspicion they were plotting to kill a police officer .
Various reports say the plan was part of a larger violent strategy and that the Hutaree were " preparing for the Antichrist . "
Here , ten key questions about this shadowy Michigan - based group :
1 . What is a Hutaree ?
The group 's website describes a Hutaree as a " Christian warrior . "
It goes on : " We believe that one day , as prophecy says , there will be an Anti-Christ .
All Christians must know this and prepare ...
The Hutaree will one day see its enemy and meet him on the battlefield is so God wills it [ sic ] "
2 . Why did the FBI initiate raids ?
According to the indictment , the Hutaree are accused of devising a complicated plot to : 1 ) Kill a police officer in Michigan ; 2 ) Exploit the subsequent funeral as an opportunity to attack other officers with IEDs ( Improvised Explosive Devices ) ; 3 ) Retreat to " rally points " after the proposed funeral attack , and then — protected by trip - wired bombs — engage law enforcement officials in " violent standoffs . "
3. What did the group hope to achieve ?
According to the Associated Press , the Hutaree believed this series of attacks would touch off a larger uprising against the U.S. Government .
Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Hutaree were " conspiring to levy war against the United States . "
It 's not immediately clear how the " Antichrist " comes into the picture .
4 . Is the group well - organized ?
Very , according to its site , which outlines a clear hierarchy along paramilitary lines .
The term " gunner " seems to designate the most humble member ( watch a YouTube video showing members training with guns ) , while " radok " is the highest rank a Hutaree can achieve .
5 . Who exactly is under suspicion ?
The indictment names nine individuals : David Stone ( 45 ) , also known as " Joe Stonewall " and " Captain Hutaree " ; his wife , Tina Mae ( 44 ) ; his sons Josh ( 21 ) and David Jr ( 19 ) ; Joshua Clough ( 28 ) , also known as " Azzurlin " ; Michael Meeks ( 40 ) ; Thomas Piatek ( 46 ) ; Kristopher Sickles ( 27 ) , also known as " Pale Horse " ; and Jacob J. Ward ( 33 ) .
6 . Are they all in custody ?
They are now .
As of yesterday , Josh Stone — son of leader David Stone — was reportedly still at large , but has since been apprehended .
7 . What exactly have they been charged with ?
Seditious conspiracy , attempting use of weapons of mass destruction , teaching the use of explosive materials , and possessing a firearm during a crime of violence .
8 . Do militia groups like the Hutaree pose a threat to public safety ?
A report by the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) says that the combination of a bad economy and a black president has generated a spike in militia activity .
According to the SPLC , the number of active militia groups in America rose from 42 in 2008 to 127 in 2009 .
9 . What other factors may be driving the uptick in militia activity ?
" Issues like eminent domain and immigration , and apparently national health care in some quarters , " says David Cid , a former FBI counter - terrorism agent and executive director of the Oklahoma City - based Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism , as quoted in the Associated Press .
10 .
Are any commentators attempting to link the Hutaree to the Tea Party ?
Conservative bloggers are bracing themselves : " The timing of this raid is troubling , " comments PipelineNews.org , " coming in the immediate wake of a sustained attempt by Democrat politicians to characterize opponents to the Obama agenda as violent , right - wing , Christian racists .... "

McDonald 's Burger Left for Two Weeks
After 11 days of sitting at room temperature in a Ziploc bag , this is the photo of the 2 burgers .
Obviously , the one on the right is the homemade burger and the one on the left is the McDonald 's cheeseburger .
The McDonald 's burger was purchased about 30 minutes before I made the control burger .
See the original post :
Two close - ups : 11 day old McDonald 's cheeseburger
This cheeseburger smells the same as when it was purchased .
When opened - it showed no signs of decomposition .
I will continue to post photos every Saturday on its progress ( or lack there of ) .
11 day old homemade cheeseburger
This cheeseburger had to be tossed out because it smelled really bad .
Why did n't the McDonald 's cheeseburger rot ?
My answer is simple .
It is n't food .
Here is the definition of food :
any nourishing substance that is eaten , drunk , or otherwise taken into the body to sustain life , provide energy , promote growth , etc .
Where I get stuck is the word nourishing .
If bacteria or fungi are n't interested in " eating " this cheeseburger , how can it be nourishing to human beings ?
On a personal note , I used to eat fast food regularly .
My university was across the street from a McDonald 's and my home in San Francisco was about 100 yards from a Burger King .
I 'm not sure when exactly it was , but I starting getting bad stomach aches whenever I ate a cheeseburger from a fast food venue .
My stomach just could n't handle the food .
At first , I thought it was because of the grease .
But , I can eat other really fatty things without a stomach ache .
Maybe I am getting stomach aches because my body cannot DIGEST this burger .
If bacteria from the air can't digest the McD 's cheeseburger in 11 days - how is my intestinal bacteria ( along with stomach acids ) supposed to digest it in 24 hours ?
Just a thought .
I am asking Micheal Pollan and someone at McDonald 's to discuss this experiment with us .
I do n't know if either will reply - but if we cause enough of a ruckus - I believe we can get some answers .
Last week 's Tostitos post must have bugged Frito - Lay , a dietician that works for them contacted me .
Please forward this blog post to your friends via FaceBook , Twitter , and / or e-mail .
Every school science class can do this experiment for $ 3 , and I think it is worth doing .
We need to discuss this " food " with our children and our families and decide how it contributes to our overall health .

It 's unfair , perhaps , to single out offenders , but Jessica Jackson Hutchins 's contribution , " Couch for a Long Time , " is , in its own peculiar way , characteristic .
It 's a couch , from the artist 's living room , that has been covered in every newspaper article about President Obama the artist has encountered .
Several glazed ceramics – vessels and abstract shapes -- sit in apparently random positions on the seat of the couch .
That 's it .
" Our government is corrupt , they are taking advantage of they 're [ sic ] power and wo n't even allow the public to view the blacklist under the idea that ' the list would highlight where to find illegal material '... this is no longer just about the censor , this is about our government trying to force us and cage us into submission like in many other corrupt countries , " one post read .
" It would be near impossible for us to take down the entire government , but we must in some way make it clear that they do not control our f--- ing lives to this degree .
We must do something . "
Referring to their February websites attacks , known as " Operation Titstorm " , several members said that taking down websites was not enough to convince the government to back down on the internet filtering policy .
" I propose assassination or at least scare the f--- out of them , " one poster wrote .
" I 'm going to stick Conroy in the throat .
Who 's with me ? " wrote another .
Another poster suggested taking some tips out of the notorious " Anarchist Cookbook " and starting to vandalise buildings , power boxes , telephone boxes and other targets .
" Telephone wires are safe to pull down with a rope , not powerlines .
Make some f--- ing thermite and melt through some government vehicles .
Find a way to shut down a freeway .
Be smart about this shit . "
Several others said violence and riots were not advisable and suggested launching attacks on a popular government website such as MySchool.edu.au .
Opponents to the internet filter policy staged a peaceful nationwide anti-censorship protest outside government buildings last month but it was considered by the community to be a dismal failure , as few people showed up .
One poster on 4 chan referred to the recent 2000 - strong riot outside a Melbourne Bob Jane T - mart store , which quickly turned violent and caused $ 50,000 worth of damage .
They noted how police stood by as people smashed windows with baseball bats , saying " we need to do that " .
" What people need to do is start a violent riot of massive proportions , storm parliament house and kill f--- ing everybody . "
Another listed a detailed recipe , with step - by - step instructions , showing how to make a bomb out of acetone , hydrogren peroxide and hydrochloric acid .
It was followed by instructions on how to destroy cars with thermite and how to make black powder bombs and napalm .
" Physical protests that threaten the running of the economy ( ie cabbie style ) seem to put those bitch politicians in their places , " a poster wrote .
One suggested members to " man up " and go out the front of Parliament , " preferably when crowded and be an hero as gruesomely as possible , a pipe bomb to the head or something " .
Colin Jacobs , spokesman for the online users ' lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia , said he believed the violent talk was most likely " just idiots mouthing off " with no real intention or capacity to follow through with their threats .
" We certainly hope this is the case .
In any case , it 's a serious matter , " he said .
" It would be a tragedy for Australia if anybody decided to try and decide political disagreements using any form of violence whatsoever .
The only punishment we would wish on a government minister is on the pages of our newspapers or at the ballot box . "
The Australian Federal Police refused to comment on whether it was monitoring 4 chan or any measures it might take to track down the posters or safeguard against any attacks .
" The AFP works with appropriate government agencies to protect and mitigate the impact of potential crimes against Australian interests , " it said in a statement .
Comment is being sought from Senator Conroy .
Mother Jones reports that Humboldt County pot farmers are afraid they 'll go out of business if their crops are legalized in the upcoming California elections .
Recently , " Keep Pot Illegal " bumper stickers have been seen on cars around the county .
In chat rooms and on blogs , anonymous writers predict that tobacco companies will crush small farmers and take marijuana production to the Central Valley .
With legalization , if residents do n't act , " we 're going to be ruined , " said Anna Hamilton , a radio host on KMUD - FM ( 91.1 ) in southern Humboldt County .
A friend told me once that he thought drug prohibition a was good thing because it promoted a black market , which is an important part of society .
Interesting point , but I 'm not sure the benefits of a black market outweigh its negative effects .
It 's a fun thing to tell people who are in favor of the drug war , though .

Nearly a year after Gabrielle Union was fired as a judge of America ’s Got Talent , the actress and NBC have ...
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president , is to deliver a firm warning to David Cameron that the Conservatives risk forfeiting vital French co-operation on energy , defence and the economy if they refuse to engage over the future of Europe .
In an attempt to lure the Conservatives into a friendlier stance , Sarkozy may be willing to offer concessions over the future of the European defence agency , seen by the party as the incubator for a future European defence force .
Sarkozy is due to meet Cameron on Friday after a working lunch with Gordon Brown in Downing Street .
Sarkozy has developed close relations with Brown .
The EDA was set up in 2004 to develop European military capability and armament co-operation .
The Conservatives have threatened to withdraw from the body and the French may be willing to see it disbanded , or radically reformed , as part of a move to shift the focus to greater bilateral co-operation between France and Britain .
The greater French strategic interest is in ensuring greater co-operation between the two countries on defence procurement to ease the pressures on both countries ' budgets .
In a speech today William Hague , the shadow foreign secretary , will hint at a willingness to work with the French when he states that a key Conservative foreign policy objective will be to " retain the ability to project power on a strategic level when working alongside the United States or France , with speed , precision , safety and effect " .
The French have been lavishing attention on the Eurosceptic shadow defence secretary Liam Fox , who raised the possibility of a Conservative UK pulling out of the EDA in a recent speech in Paris .
But Fox also believes Anglo - French defence co-operation is in both countries ' mutual interest , and should form an important element of the UK strategic defence review .
Sarkozy is anxious to see Anglo - French co-operation prosper whoever is elected in the UK and is working hard to persuade Cameron to avoid confrontation over the EU powers .
Conservative - French relations hit a low last November when Pierre Lellouche , France 's Europe minister , described as " pathetic " the Tories ' EU plans .
He warned that they would not succeed " for a minute " .
Sarkozy is not expecting any early movement from Cameron if he is elected prime minister on his party 's decision to leave the European People 's party , the centre - right grouping in the European parliament .
But the French are hoping for signs that Cameron will at least set out in private what concessions he wants in his negotiations with the EU .
The Tory leader has said it may take five years to repatriate powers .
Cameron will also be looking for assurances from Sarkozy that the French will not back German plans for further treaty changes to bring about a European monetary fund , an idea floated this week by the German chancellor Angela Merkel .
Sarkozy wants British agreement on greater energy co-operation , a stronger price for carbon in Europe , defence co-operation and measures to prevent Europe slipping back into recession .
The French owened ED has made massive investment in the UK energy market , and is still not yet clear what the Conservative energy policy will be on nuclear and carbon subsidies .
In a bid to understand the Conservative thinking , French ministers have staged bilaterals with senior shadow cabinet members including Hague , George Osborne , Chris Grayling and Michael Gove .
Last night Chris Bryant , the Europe minister , attacked the Conservatives over their position on Europe .
He said : " The Tories want to avoid talking about Europe , they do n't want any questions before the election about Europe . "

View all data and primary source documents : Koch Foundations Funding to Climate Denial Groups
Data above is sourced from annual IRS Form 990 filings by the Koch family foundations .
Source documents are available in the “ Source Docs ” tab of the spreadsheet .
About Our Data :
Greenpeace uses 1997 as a benchmark year due to increased coordinated backlash against global climate negotiations leading to the Kyoto Protocol of 1998 .
We define climate change denial as “ anyone who is obstructing , delaying or trying to derail policy steps that are in line with the scientific consensus that says we need to take rapid steps to decarbonize the economy . ”
We do this to hold accountable those who do not state their intentions honestly .
Most modern lobbyists do not deny the irrefutable science indicating that our planet is warming , but instead deny the need for viable solutions — such as a cost on industrial carbon pollution , energy efficiency , clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels — as demonstrated by the science .
The Koch brothers continue to finance campaigns to make Americans doubt the seriousness of global warming , increasingly hiding money through nonprofits like DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund .
Why focus on Charles Koch and David Koch ?
Many large foundations associated with corporate fortunes are active in financing climate denial groups — Anschutz , Bradley , Coors , DeVos , Dunn , Howard , Pope , Scaife , Searle , and Seid , to name a few .
Unlike Koch , most of those fortunes did not come from owning a corporation like Koch Industries , historically rooted in fossil fuel operations .
And none come as close as the Kochs in terms of decades - long focus on actively building a political influence network and coordinating other wealthy executives , corporations and families to dump amounts money into politics that not even the Koch brothers could afford .
How Koch - funded Climate Denial Front Groups Work Together – Animation by Taki Oldham :
Billionaire oilman David Koch used to joke that Koch Industries was “ the biggest company you ’ve never heard of . ”
Now the shroud of secrecy has thankfully been lifted , revealing the $ 127 million that he and his brother Charles have quietly funneled to climate - denial front groups that are working to delay policies and regulations aimed at stopping global warming , most of which are part of the State Policy Network .
Today , the Kochs are being watched as a prime example of the corporate takeover of government .
Their funding and co-opting of the Tea Party movement is now well documented .
Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch have a vested interest in delaying climate action : they ’ve made billions from their ownership and control of Koch Industries , an oil corporation that is the second largest privately - held company in America ( which also happens to have an especially poor environmental record ) .
It ’s timely that more people are now aware of Charles and David Koch and just what they ’re up to .
A growing awareness of these oil billionaires ’ destructive agenda has led to increased scrutiny and resistance from people and organizations all over the United States .
We continue to expose the connections between climate denial front groups and the secretive billionaires who are funding their efforts .

The Koch brothers , their family members , and their employees direct a web of financing that supports conservative special interest groups and think - tanks , with a strong focus on fighting environmental regulation , opposing clean energy legislation , and easing limits on industrial pollution .
This money is typically funneled through one of three “ charitable ” foundations the Kochs have set up : the now - defunct Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation ; the Charles Koch Foundation ; the David H. Koch Charitable Foundation ; and the Knowledge and Progress Fund , which exclusively directs Koch money to Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund .

The most misguided mother in Britain ?
She 's a ' Human Barbie ' who injects her 16 - year - old with Botox ... all in the name of love
What modern mother has n't worried about her daughter 's computer habit ?
When Sarah Burge bemoans the fact that 16 - year - old Hannah ' spends hour after hour peering at the screen ' , it 's hard not to sympathise .
So what exactly is Sarah 's concern - online perverts ?
Facebook bullies ?
Well , no .
She 's worried about a different sort of nuisance altogether - Hannah 's future wrinkles .
' I look at Hannah when she 's on the computer - which she is for hours - and she 's frowning .
That leads to furrows between the eyes and , eventually , wrinkles .
Misguided ?
Hannah Burge , 16 , ( left ) with her mother Sarah , the ' Human Barbie ' , who injects her with Botox in an effort to prevent future wrinkles
' Of course , you can't take computers away from your children , but we can do something about the frowning , ca n't we ?
' That 's one of the reasons why , when Hannah asked me if she could try Botox , I said yes .
I 'm not saying she has wrinkles now , but if we can prevent them in the future , what 's the problem ? '
What 's the problem with giving a 16 - year - old Botox ?
Is the woman serious ?
The fact that the question even has to be asked is an indication of how different this 49 - year - old is to the women she describes disparagingly as ' other mums ' .
Not being like the other mothers at the school gates is something Sarah is proud of .
In truth , it 's been her raison d'etre for as long as she can remember .
It led her down the route of extreme cosmetic surgery and to a bizarre personal challenge to turn herself into something akin to a Human Barbie .
To date , she holds the record for having had the most procedures carried out on one woman .
She has been remodelled from head to toe , at a cost of £ 500,000 , with results that can only be described as eye - catching .
Procedures she 's had include three facelifts , a brow lift , liposuction and buttock and breast implants .
Fine , if that floats your boat , but her self - confessed obsession with tweaking what nature provided has now become an altogether different proposition .
For , having pretty much exhausted parts of her own body to ' improve ' , she has moved on to her children .
And what a storm this has caused , nationally as well as locally .
When the Mail reported earlier this week that she had allowed her daughter to have Botox at just 15 , internet chatrooms went into meltdown as readers clamoured to post their opinions .
Parental consent : Sarah pictured injecting Botox into daughter Hannah , who first had the treatment on holiday in Marbella
The verdict was not good .
' Mad cow ' was one of the politer comments .
More devastating for Sarah were the suggestions that , as well as a shrink , she could do with the services of a social worker .
' People have called me all sorts of things over the years .
A freak , a lunatic .
I can deal with those .
But calling me a bad mother - saying that I am abusing my daughter , is not on , ' she rants , when I meet her to find out how on earth having her ears pinned back aged seven ( the start of her surgery ' addiction ' , she reckons ) could have led to this .
' It 's not abuse .
How can it be a abuse .
She is 16 years old !'
Well no .
The facts are that Hannah , who is still at school and wants to be a dancer , was 15 when she first had Botox on holiday in Marbella .
Sarah 's signature , giving consent , was required .
She waves an arm .
' Yeah , that was in Marbella , out of jurisdiction . '
Whatever that means .
But morally ?
Morals do n't have jurisdictions .
' How could I have a problem with it ?
It 's what I do myself , and if I did n't help her she could have gone to some quack or voodoo doctor , got the stuff anywhere .
' I was being the responsible one here . '
Perhaps it 's not surprising that Sarah genuinely can't see what the fuss is about .
A trained therapist herself , she routinely gives herself Botox jabs , pumps her face full of fillers and admits that she has injected Hannah herself .
Just like Mummy ?
Sarah with her youngest daughter , six - year - old Poppy
' But not with Botox .
With an empty needle , just to stimulate the Botox that was already there . '
We embark on something of a science lesson , where she talks at length about how Botox really is n't harmful .
' It 's Botox Hannah had , not barbiturates , ' she points out .
' It 's used to treat medical conditions .
People get it on their bunions .
It 's out of the system within three months .
What 's the problem ? '
Indeed , she 's happy that Botox is the only vice Hannah is interested in dabbling in .
' They are doing everything at her age , are n't they ?
Drugs , sex , wild parties .
I 've known parents giving their kids marijuana .
Now that 's abuse .
' If Botox is all I 've got to worry about with Hannah , thank goodness .
' A lot of this criticism is just ignorance about the procedure .
All this talk of wrinkles is rubbish .
Botox does n't erase wrinkles , it just paralyses the muscles .
It 's about freshening you up . '
But is n't a teenage face about as ' fresh ' as it gets ?
' I know a lot of 18 - year - olds who look dreadful .
They have sun damage already and terrible skin . '
Sarah likes to think she knows a thing or two about teenage girls .
She says her ' open ' approach to cosmetic surgery has made her popular with her daughter 's friends , who are ' obsessed with it ' .
' They are , though , and that 's not my fault .
It 's society .
They are all on the TV saying they want a boob job for their 16th birthday , and a fast car , and to look like Jordan .
' They want the trappings , to be part of the beautiful people , and they think cosmetic surgery can help them achieve that . '
And she sympathises .
Sarah herself was stage - school kid , a wannabe star who ended up as a bunny girl and in an abusive relationship .
She likes to think she is famous these days , but her fame has only come about because of her surgery .
As she puts it , 'it 's a vicious circle ' .
' It does n't always work the way the teenagers think it will , and I 've got caught in a trap .
I have to have more cosmetic work in order to work , if you know what I mean .
' People forget that I 'm a businesswoman , you know .
I 've made all this myself , from nothing . '
' It 's big , fat , ugly women who like to sit in judgement '
All what ?
She may jet around the world parading on TV shows , but at home she hardly seems happy .
I say that the little village where she lives is beautiful .
She pulls a face .
' We want to move .
I want to live in London .
I do n't fit in here . '
She says , with glee , that the other mums in the area ' are n't too happy ' when their daughters come round to her house .
' Do they honestly think I 'm going to force Botox on their daughters ?
Come on !
I listen to their concerns about their looks .
I do n't know a single one who is happy with how they are .
We have a laugh .
We end up tap dancing in the kitchen .
' The kids end up saying to me : " I wish my mum was like you . " '
Really ?
The infectious laugh and fruity language may be attractive to a teenager , but does any youngster truly want their mum flashing her pants at complete strangers ?
This is what happens when you interview Sarah .
When we meet , she is wearing an orange lace see - through dress which barely covers her bum ( more of which later ) and is designed to show off her florescent pink underwear .
Disturbing enough if you are interviewing a porn star in a Soho nightclub .
Downright freaky on a suburban sofa on a Thursday afternoon .
She wo n't let any of her daughters be present for this interview so it is n't possible to watch her interact with them .
What is clear , though , is that her eternal quest for ' youthful radiance ' has dominated all their lives .
Addiction : Sarah holds the record for having had the most plastic surgery procedures carried out on one woman
She has three children , aged 26 , 16 and six , who are used to their mother disappearing for a few days and coming back with new cheeks / eyes / tummy .
' Oh , they take no notice now .
I come back looking like a walking , bandaged mummy and they say , " Oh hi , Mum . "
Once , Charlotte said to me : " Why ca n't you be normal , like the other mummies " , but she was only being flippant .
' I said : " Would you love me more , then ? "
And she said : " Of course not . " '
We talk about role models .
She thinks she is a ' brilliant one ' .
' I am taking care of myself , not letting myself go .
I think I 'm a better role model than parents who drink or take drugs .
All those women who get fat , bitter and depressed .
Who would want that ?
' I'm the first to say that my surgery has become an addiction .
But it makes me happy , and a fun person to be around .
' Can you imagine what I 'd be like if I was fat and ugly and never wanted to have sex with my husband ?
That 's the reality for a lot of women . '
Where this all goes woefully awry is when you bring children into that sort of universe .
It is in the nature of little girls to idolise their mothers , and to wish to emulate them .
By Sarah 's own admission , some of her children 's earliest memories will be of their mother with a needle in her hand , or corrosive material on her face .
' When Poppy was a baby , I was bathing her one day and I thought I 'd do a chemical peel at the same time , ' she tells me .
' I left it on for too long .
It was fine , but it could have been disastrous .
I just forgot .
Ha ha ha . '
She says she 's just being honest about these things , where most women are n't .
' I do n't hide it , no , of course not .
I 'll get the needles out and inject myself in front of them , sure , and they 'll watch .
' It 's like putting lipstick on .
Little girls love to watch .
' Poppy , who is six now , knows exactly what I 'm doing .
She says : " Mummy , are you making your wrinkles go away ? "
' But I categorically do n't inflict anything on them .
Charlotte is 26 , but she still has n't expressed any interest in having anything done .
' If she does , she will come to me and I will guide her in the right direction , but it 's not on her agenda right now .
' Hannah has had Botox .
She 's been on about getting her teeth whitened .
But so what ?
She wants to be a dancer .
She 's going into a world where appearances are important . '
We talk about her views on things such as nail varnish for toddlers and high heels for babies .
She has no problem with any of it .
' You should be happy if your little girl wants nail polish at three .
It shows she 's creative , ' she tells me .
' Surgery 's become an addiction - but I 'm a great role model '
' I would encourage her .
Help her put the eyeshadow on .
What about Tom Cruise 's precocious little daughter ?
I think she 's brilliant .
Those little heels .
Lovely .
We all dressed up in our mother 's clothes did n't we ?
What 's the harm ?
' I do n't see that by giving my daughter some dermabrasion ( a kind of non-surgical beauty procedure ) , as I did with Hannah , they are going to hurtle down the road into boob jobs and tummy tucks . '
Would that horrify her ?
She is quiet for a minute .
' I do n't know .
I just want them to be happy . '
She says that they are a ' completely normal family , not this weird family who are obsessed with cosmetic surgery ' , and yet there is precious little normality here .
Her husband Tony , a salesman - who she has just been praising as being ' not at all the male model type ' - has had his own nips and tucks , notably on his ' horrible turkey gobble neck ' .
Still , she seems surprised that people have strong opinions on all this being passed on to the next generation .
' Why do people hate me ? ' she asks at one point .
' I 've had a message from someone saying " I hope you die " .
That 's awful . '
Sarah is n't given to self - analysis .
She knows she has a problem with cosmetic surgery , but is also convinced that other women have a problem with jealousy .
For someone who pleads not to be judged , she can be vitriolic in dishing it out .
' The majority of those who criticise me are women , and they are bitter people who , given the money and the opportunity , would go out and have something done themselves .
The only ones who sit in judgment of me are the big , fat , ugly ones anyway .
It 's jealousy , pure and simple . '
Role model ?
Sarah aged 14 , before she spent £ 500,000 on plastic surgery
And her reaction is so telling .
Her abhorrence for ' normal ' women , who battle with the pounds , and are quite content with quiet village life is the truly shocking thing .
When I ask if it 's truly helpful to suggest that your daughters might want to emulate Jordan , she snorts .
' What , would you rather they end up being the sort of woman who works in Tesco , married to a binman ?
I do n't think so . '
You can't fault someone for not wanting to appear outwardly ' mumsy ' , but Sarah seems determined to reject anything remotely ' boring ' .
There 's a telling moment during our interview when she reveals - with some pride - that she has never cooked a ' proper ' meal in her life .
' I can't do it .
I have trouble with the microwave .
I can burn things in it .
I never , ever cook . '
Her children look well nourished , though .
What do they eat ?
' Oh , I 've always ended up with men who can cook , ' she says breezily .
When you have had so much surgery , there are always likely to be running repairs .
Her posterior is currently a sore subject : she had implants in it some years ago .
To my untrained eye it looks like a little shelf you might display miniature teacups on , but she seems happy with the pertness .
The only problem is that one buttock tends to ' inflate a bit , every so often ' .
' It happens most on aeroplanes , ' she explains , hooting with laughter .
' After a flight , one buttock is noticeably larger than the other .
It goes down again after a few days , but it 's weird nonetheless .
I 've no idea why that would happen .
There is no medical explanation .'
We return to the subject of her daughters .
Will they be having anything ' done ' soon ?
She shakes her head , but repeats that the elder two are old enough to make their own decisions .
And little Poppy ?
At six she is presumably far , far too young to even be thinking of the surgeon 's scalpel ?
' Oh she has a little nodule just by her ear , ' Sarah says , quite matter - of - factly .
' That will have to come off , of course . '
Is this how it begins ?
For all their sakes , you hope not .

Presidnt Obama ’s nuclear security summit scored an early victory on Monday , since Obama was able to announce that Ukraine would give up its stock of high enriched uranium by 2012 .
Ukraine kept some of the high enriched uranium ( HEU ) from Russian warheads on its territory .
The US has generally been successful in convincing former Soviet states other than Russia to give up stockpiles of HEU ( uranium enriched to over 20 % ) .
But it should be remembered that Ukraine is not a great Power , and is sandwiched uneasily between the Russian Federation and the European Union .
Ukraine would like to join the EU .
It has the prospect of further US economic aid .
And it wants to avoid falling back under Russian control .
Its best shot at relative independence and economic growth is cooperation with the West .
In contrast , Iran is not being so forthcoming .
It is not afraid of any third party , the way the Ukraine fears Russia .
It does not have to rush into the arms of the US and the EU to guarantee its independence .
Indeed , Tehran has very bad memories of European and American political dominance .
Its nuclear enrichment program ( there is no evidence of a weapons program ) is intended to warn the great powers off any further meddling in Iran .
On Iran , the picture for Obama was far more mixed .
Turkey announced itself firmly against ratcheting up sanctions on Iran .
This stance matters because Turkey is a non-permanent member of the UNSC .
Likewise Brazil currently has a seat , and its goverment , as well , has just announced opposition to further Iran sanctions .
And while China may have softened slightly on the issue of sanctions on Iran to deter it from pursuing nuclear enrichment , Beijing is unlikely to sign on to what Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu called ‘ crippling sanctions . ’
Meanwhile , Iran took strong exception to the new Obama security doctrine that appeared to leave open the possibility of a US attack on Iran .
Tehran is approaching the UN for a resolution condemning the US .
Obama needs a Ukraine - style breakthrough if his Iran policy is to bear fruit .
The trick would be in convincing Iran ’s ruling clerics that they would have more independence , not less , without the nuclear research program .
But apparently that would be too big a carrot for Washington to offer .
Storage networking outfit QLogic has sued archrival Emulex for posting a web video that shows an egg frying on a QLogic converged network adapter .
As noticed by The Street , QLogic filed suit on Monday in a California Superior Court , claiming the Emulex video is intentionally deceptive .
" Emulex 's video purporting to show an egg frying on a QLogic semiconductor chip is misleading and intended to deceive potential customers of QLogic products , " the suit reads .
The suit also alleges that during a recent quarterly earnings call , Emulex made " completely and utterly false statements " intended to harm QLogic 's business .
Among other things , the suit says , Emulex claimed that QLogic 's competing converged network adapter lacked a " certified and hardened Ethernet stack to support demanding server requirements . "
In the Emulex video - posted to YouTube and an Emulex blog in late January - a company engineer tells viewers he wants to help them avoid an " actual crash and burn in the data center , " before claiming that the QLogic QLE8152 converged network adapter has an internal temperature of 190 degrees Fahrenheit , " as much as 70 degrees higher " than the Emulex OCe10102 .
He then says that higher temperatures " can be directly correlated to lower performance and lower reliability . "
And " to prove his point , " the engineer presents what he calls an unconventional test .
" Instead of going into the lab , " he says , " we 're going into the kitchen . "
The video then cuts to a miniature frying pan sitting atop the chip at the heart of the QLogic QLE98152 .
" This time lapse video shows that [ the chip ] gets so hot , you can actually fry an egg on it , " the engineer says .
" Would you want this in your server ?
No way . "
Yes , the video is time - lapsed .
And the egg is squeezed onto the miniature frying pan with a syringe .
" In fact , it 's not just the [ chip ] that 's at risk , " the Emulex engineer continues .
" The heat has to go somewhere and it happens to be right into your server .
A server failure can have a huge impact on your operations , employee productivity , or customer satisfaction , depending on your applications . "
And you 've guessed the punchline .
" If you want the lowest temperatures , the best performance , and proven reliable products , come to Emulex , " he says , " if you want breakfast , go to QLogic . "
QLogic 's suit insists the video's claims are unfounded .
" Emulex has no basis to support its ' datacenter failure ' claims , and as a result , its claims are false and misleading and intended to deceive potential customers of QLogic products , " the suit reads .
The does n't say one way or another whether a QLogic converged network adapter can fry an egg - though it does say that " Emulex 's focus on a point heat source on a QLogic product and equating that with reliability " is misleading as well .

Iggy Pop walks on a sea of hands .
In the photo , shot in Cincinnati in 1970 , the singer , then 23 , stands upright while fans ’ hands snake up his calves .
He is , quintessentially , shirtless ; the muscles of his torso ripple .
A palpable energy powers the still image .
Every face is turned toward him .
It ’s hard not to get a little hagiographic when discussing the Stooges , so extreme is their story , so complete their devotion to their cause .
That cause , of course , was a sort of nihilism : Rarely have musicians waded so deeply into the muck of violence , boredom , drugs , chaos , insanity and sadomasochism -- in both their music and their lives .
You ca n’t help but rubberneck at the story of this high - speed train hurtling off the tracks .
Yet when that story is recounted in the overwrought and under - thought style of Richard Meltzer wannabe Robert Matheu , it begins to bloat .
His “ The Stooges : The Authorized and Illustrated Story ” is full of the dead air of hype .
The Stooges were as important as a rock band can be .
They deserve a better chronicler than Matheu , an able photographer whose primary qualification as a historian is that he has known the band since its early days in Michigan and has therefore been designated its official “ Stoogeologist . ”
For all his acuity with a camera , Matheu is a writer of purple prose and bad analogies -- the most unspeakably awful of which comes early : “ The Stooges suffered through more brutal ups and downs than a biker brothel on initiation night . ”
Infatuated with his own voice , Matheu tells unofficial Stoogeologists little they do n’t already know .
Then again , authorized biographies are usually sources of carefully selected information , not the whole picture .
For a more engaging , informative and well - written history of the Stooges , read Paul Trynka ’s 2007 biography “ Iggy Pop : Open Up and Bleed . ”
Matheu ’s book may have been created partly in reaction to Trynka ’s work .
But by glossing over inconvenient subjects -- guitarist Ron Asheton ’s obsession with the Third Reich , Pop ’s use of gay images and lyrics -- the authorized and illustrated “ The Stooges ” remains incomplete .
The photos , though , make up for some of the failings of the text .
In his thoughtful introduction , Alice Cooper writes that the Stooges and the Doors were the only bands he wanted to see every night because you did n’t know what was going to happen .
Like Jim Morrison , Pop was both showman and shaman .
He was extremely theatrical in his presentation , but once onstage , and even in photo shoots , he channeled something primal and often ( self - ) destructive .
This comes through in a shot of Pop doing a split in flowered briefs and thigh - high boots .
Or in an image from the ill - fated shoot for the Stooges ’ first album , in which the singer is caught hurtling through the air over his seated bandmates , who wince in anticipation of his crash to ground .
In a 2008 Matheu photo , Pop is still cat - like and flexible as he mounts a stack of Marshall amps while bassist Mike Watt roars on his knees .
“ The Stooges ” is not only a forum for Matheu ’s work :
There are many pictures by other photographers , and reviews of Stooges ’ albums by different writers , including Dave DiMartino and Brain J. Bowe ( whose chapter on “ Metallic K.O. ” left me wishing he were the official Stoogeologist ) .
Still , certain images -- like the famous photos of a dazed Pop bleeding from wounds inflicted by either tossed objects or his own hand -- have been left out .
Asheton died shortly before Matheu ’s book went to press .
Pop has said that the Stooges , who reunited in 2003 after 29 years apart , will live on , with James Williamson on guitar .
( Pop first hired Williamson in 1972 , demoting Asheton to bass . )
But I ’m not convinced that the original guitarist ’s passing should n’t be the final chapter of the Stooges story .
Woefully unsuccessful and undervalued in their prime , the Stooges have generally been granted their place in history as punk progenitors ( except by the idiots at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ) .
“ The Stooges ” is most interesting in its documentation of their crazy prime .
But it does n’t look like an experience anyone would want to -- or could -- live through twice .
McDonnell is the author of “ Mamarama : A Memoir of Sex , Kids and Rock ‘ n ’ Roll ” and an Annenberg fellow at USC .
Sheila Kelley , the actress who plays the brand new character Zoe on Lost , just did an interview with Us Weekly and it is interesting !
She says that Zoe " has the answer . "
Here are the most interesting quotes about the Tina Fey doppleganger :
She is Charles Widmore 's right hand .
She does all his dirty work .
But she has her own strategy and agenda as well .
In one script , I 'm going in one direction .
In another script , I 'm going 180 degrees the other way .
She is looking for someone on the island .
This beautiful journey of this entire show , between good and evil , between science and faith , lies within Zoe .
Zoe has the answer .
Zoe knows .
The plot thickens !

Sir Stirling won 16 F1 Grand Prix races in his illustrious career Sir Stirling Moss is recovering in hospital after falling down a lift shaft at home and breaking both ankles .
The Formula
One racing legend , 80 , fell three floors when his lift opened in error on Saturday , his website said .
Paramedics were called to his home in Mayfair and he underwent surgery at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel .
He also broke four bones in a foot , chipped four vertebrae and suffered skin damage , the website said .
His family said he was recovering well .
' Very unfortunate '
The website said : " He remained conscious throughout .
With the assistance of Professor Sid Watkins he was moved on Sunday to a hospital closer to his home where he underwent surgery on both his ankles , which were plated and pinned .
" The door to the lift , that should have remained locked if the lift was not on the floor that it was called from , opened in error .
" He stepped into the narrow open shaft in the expectation that the lift would be present for him to walk into , as it should have been . "
Lady Moss , Sir Stirling 's wife , said : " This was a very unfortunate accident , it could have just as easily been another member of the family stepping into where the lift should have been . "
His family said he was comfortable after a good night 's rest and they expected the recovery to take up to six weeks .
Sir Stirling is known in the racing community as the greatest driver never to have won the Formula One championship .
He won 16 Grand Prix races between 1951 and 1961 and retired after crashing at Goodwood in 1962 .

For last week ’s Green Chip Stocks , I took a critical look at the new Bloom Box fuel cell system , and concluded that it ’s a modest improvement over standard natural gas - fired grid power .
By Chris Nelder
Friday , February 26th , 2010
When I was a child , I spake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
( 1 Corinthians 13:11 )
Judging by the excitement around the unveiling of the Bloom Box , you ’d think it was the Second Coming .
The green blogs fell all over themselves repeating the breathless “ Holy Grail ” speculations in Lesley Stahl ’s 60 Minutes report , which was indistinguishable from an in - house marketing puff piece .
Bloom Energy ’s media blitz ended eight years in stealth mode , and the star - studded coming - out ceremony on Wednesday featured notables such as board member Gen. Colin Powell , California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , legendary VC John Doerr of Kleiner , Perkins , Caulfield & Byers , Google co-founder Larry Page , eBay CEO John Donahoe and Wal - Mart COO Bill Simon .
The market could dwarf the Internet , they said .
It ’s like another Google .
It ’s a “ disruptive technology ” akin to cell phones replacing land lines .
It will slash CO2 emissions and replace the grid .
It ’s twice as efficient as grid power generation .
Its technology is based on common beach sand , not expensive and corrosive materials .
It will “ change the world . ” ( Cue Tom Waits ’ “ Step Right Up . ” )
They congratulated themselves with bear hugs and “ I love you , man ”s .
Bloom Energy CEO KR
Sridhar laid out his bold vision : Bloom Boxes would provide affordable , abundant , reliable , clean electricity to every home and business and light up the dark areas of the world –in a decade .
It ’s “ a market size that starts with a ‘ T’ , ” not a ‘ B ’ , he said at the company ’s 2002 launch .
After a decade of studying energy , such claims instantly arouse my skepticism .
I had to take a closer look .
What It Is
The Bloom Box is a mini power plant based on fuel cell technology .
Fuel cells use an electrochemical ( not thermal ) process to separate the protons and electrons of the fuel , then pass the electrons through a circuit to generate electricity .
At the end of the process , the protons and electrons recombine along with oxygen .
If the fuel is pure hydrogen , the emissions will be pure water , but if the fuel is a hydrocarbon , emissions will also contain carbon dioxide .
Fuel cells are n’t new .
The first was invented by a Swiss - German chemist named Christian Friedrich Schönbein in 1838 , and at least 20 different designs now exist .
A long history of companies have attempted to bring a cost - effective and practical device to market , and in the last decade hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into their research and development .
None have achieved real commercial viability yet .
According to data assembled by Fuel Cells 2000 , fewer than 1,000 units are in operation or planned worldwide .
One of the top public U.S. fuel cell manufacturers , Fuel Cell Energy , Inc. ( NASDAQ : FCEL ) has a mere 90 installations worldwide , and its stock has been moribund since 2002 .
What ’s new about the Bloom Box is that it claims to be high efficiency ( producing more power with less waste heat than other fuel cells ) , small , relatively cheap , and able to run on a variety of fuels including natural gas , landfill gas , and biogas .
Its solid oxide design reportedly uses zirconium oxide for the proton - exchange membrane oxygen ion conductor .
Let ’s have a look at the numbers , assembled from Bloom ’s statements and various blogs .
One cell produces 25 watts .
A “ residential sized ” stack of cells produces 1 kilowatt ( kW ) , which Sridhar claims could be on the market at a price point of $ 3000 in five years .
A 100 kW system ( before incentives ) costs $ 700,000 to $ 800,000 .
For my purposes I ’ll take the high estimate and call it $ 8,000 / kW .
Most units will run on natural gas .
Assuming the gas costs $ 7 per million BTU , the cost of generation is in the $ 0.13 to $ 0.14 per kilowatt - hour ( kWh ) range , before subsidies .
After factoring in the federal 30 % investment tax credit , the $ 2,500 / kW California rebate , and the claimed 10 - year lifespan , the unit should produce power for roughly $ 0.08 to $ 0.10 / kWh .
The average retail grid power price in the U.S. is about $ 0.11 / kWh .
Under those metrics , the company claims it will take three to five years to pay itself off , including the cost of swapping out the used - up fuel cell stack twice during the 10 - year warranty period .
This strikes me as a highly dubious claim .
The CO2 emissions when running on natural gas are reportedly 0.8 pounds / kWh , as compared with 2 pounds / kWh for coal - fired plants and 1.3 pounds / kWh for natural gas - fired plants .
Hence the squishy claim that the unit produces power with “ half the emissions ” of grid power from natural gas .
What It Is n’t
First , a 1 kW unit is n’t enough to power a house in the U.S.
I know from my experience in the solar business that 2.5 kW on an averaged demand basis is more like it .
Peak demand loads can be much higher .
For example , a hair dryer , a microwave , and a toaster together could draw more than 5 kW .
Large houses can need 10 kW or more on average .
So even at Sridhar ’s $ 3000 price point for a 1 kW unit , a residential application would cost more like $ 7500 .
But long experience in watching “ breakthrough ” devices like this come to market tells me that one has to discount the initial claims by at least a factor of two .
So the real price point will probably be closer to $ 6000 / kW in five years , or $ 3000 in ten , in which case the unit might never pay itself off in a residential application over the 10 - year warranty period .
A quick calculation by editor Rembrandt Koppelaar at The Oil Drum also questions the payback period .
Assuming $ 0.10 / kWh for grid power and an $ 800,000 cost for a 100 kW unit , he calculates it would pay itself off in 15 years–five years longer than its expected lifespan .
The eBay installation featured in the rollout offers a final example .
The scant available information about this installation suggests that it consists of five 100 kW units , at a cost of $ 800,000 each , which have saved the company $ 100,000 in grid power costs over nine months .
If that surmise is correct , then the $ 4 million installation will pay for itself in 30 years .
Second , since nearly all customers will run the unit on natural gas , it does n’t fulfill the claims of clean , abundant , or cheap power .
If my expectation of a global natural gas peak in the 2020 - 2025 range is correct , it could in reality make the situation worse , by moving significant loads to natural gas just as supply starts to flatten out .
In effect , it would allow us to crawl farther out on the fossil - fuel limb just before it cracks .
It definitely wo n’t make sense to use solar power to crack water into hydrogen and oxygen in order to use the hydrogen in a fuel cell .
It would be far more efficient , and cheaper , to simply use the solar power .
Third , the suggestion that it will “ replace the grid ” is simply nonsense .
Few of the customers in the commercial market will generate all of their power with Bloom Boxes ( the high - profile campuses currently testing the units get 15 % of their power or less from them ) , and most buildings already have grid connections .
The units might eventually replace some of the load carried by utility power plants , but that ’s about it .
Even a residential application would not eliminate the need for grid power unless it was sized to meet peak loads , which would not make economic sense .
Finally , and most importantly , there is the scale problem .
I do n’t know what universe you ’d have to live in to think that a company currently producing one unit a day is going to put several billion of them into operation in one decade , or even five .
Particularly if your outlook on capital markets for the next five decades is informed by an education in peak fossil fuels .
The Verdict
The Bloom Box does n’t belong in any discussion about renewable , clean power or changing the world .
The main effect of the device would be to transfer some of the power generation load off centralized coal plants and onto distributed natural gas plants .
Few customers ( and probably only commercial and industrial ones , at that ) will have the option of running it on biogas or landfill gas .
For the slightly more than half of the homes in the U.S. that even have a natural gas line , it wo n’t make economic sense .
Therefore I do not expect it to become a viable residential application .
Nor do I expect it to light up the Third World without installing a network of natural gas lines–in itself , an unlikely proposition .
A fair comparison would be to a standard natural gas - fired backup generator .
A quick Google search finds an 18 kW Briggs & Stratton natural gas backup generator for $ 4,200 .
If $ 3,000 will get me a 1 kW Bloom Box , then an 18 kW device would be $ 54,000 .
Is that a price premium any homeowner would pay for slightly reduced emissions ?
For another cost comparison , at $ 8000 / kW , rooftop solar ( after incentives ) is cheaper today .
As long as you have a functioning grid , the 24×7 benefit of a fuel cell ( assuming uninterrupted natural gas supply ) would n’t be worth the cost premium over solar .
And once it ’s installed , a solar PV system consumes no fuel , and produces no emissions .
By time a Bloom Box goes for $ 3,000 / kW , my bet is that solar will still be cheaper .
Should natural gas prices go to $ 15 or $ 20 in the next decade ( a not unreasonable proposition ) then solar will be half the price , or less , and the payback period for the fuel cell would lengthen considerably .
What it can do is allow commercial customers to claim some green cred for reduced emissions while paying close to the going market rate for power .
However , I expect a solid handful of more mature companies ( like FuelCell Energy , Kyocera , UTC , and Ballard Technologies ) to give them a run for their money .
If the Bloom Box does , in fact , sport a 50 % efficiency gain over utility plants –which I think still needs to be proved–then that should confer an advantage on it in the form of carbon reduction incentives .
That may be the best advantage the Bloom Box has .
There are certainly important intangible benefits in distributed generation and baseload ( 24×7 ) capacity , as my readers well know .
However , the Bloom Box ’s reliance on natural gas cannot be overlooked , and it appears that nearly everyone has overlooked it here .
The short lifespan of the device and the need to swap out the cell stack every five years must be factored in as well .
The cost of maintenance and the availability of service technicians are important questions that still loom over the Bloom .
By comparison , a rooftop solar installation is low tech , low maintenance , and far more durable .
In short , I view the Bloom Box as a modest gain over the status quo in natural gas fired power supply .
A world - changer it is not .
Too Big To Grail
The most interesting part of the Bloom Box story is the social aspect .
Lesley Stahl ’s gushing 60 Minutes take on the Bloom Box was , in so many ways , a paragon of everything that ’s wrong with energy coverage in the media .
She was in hot pursuit of “ the next big thing , ” and found the unit to be “ awfully dazzling ” in a market “ worth bazillions . ”
“ I ’m installing a power plant ! ” she exclaimed with childlike glee , as she peeled the shipping packaging off a new unit .
She was obviously very impressed that the technology was an inversion of an invention that could produce oxygen so people could live on Mars .
Her opening statement , “ In the world of energy , the Holy Grail is a power source that ’s inexpensive and clean , with no emissions , ” is either a complete non-sequitur , or a concise demonstration of her energy illiteracy .
One leans toward the latter explanation after watching her ask if the box could use solar as a power source , and Sridhar ’s humoring affirmation .
The pressure is clearly on the MSM to make some noise for Holy Grails .
There is also something telling about the appetite for hope in the way the blogosphere lapped up the excitement around the unveiling .
The appeal to authority of the brass on stage clearly worked , producing uncritical comments like “ Gee whiz , $ 400 million in capital , it clearly works , it ’s cheap , and fits in my backyard ?
I ’m in ! ”
The fact is that the energy problem is too big to grail .
Or , as the peakists say , “ There are no silver bullets , only silver BBs . ”
BBs as in Bloom Box .
I want to be clear .
I spent nearly two decades in the computer industry before I got seriously into energy .
I used my first computer ( a very early , educational prototype ) at the age of five , in 1969 .
I saw the computer revolution firsthand , and I know the power of technological development .
But I also know that the ingrained optimism of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs , as much as I love them , simply does not translate to the challenge of generating or saving hard BTUs .
No single technology will save us .
Moore ’s Law does not apply here .
The history of energy is littered with the bodies of enterprising souls just like them .
One thing I will say :
Only a venture capital firm with the power of Kleiner , Perkins could coordinate such a media blitz and star - studded unveiling , and wow the socks off the media .
My hat is off ; they scored a major coup with this one .
I remain staunchly rooted in numbers , and of the mind that it ’s better to have no hope than false hope , because it pushes us toward real solutions .
The Doomsday clock is ticking .
It ’s time to put aside childish things , retire the phrase “ Holy Grail ” permanently , and get real about energy .
Until next time ,
Chris

LOS ANGELES —
Not since the Beach Boys were in peach fuzz and crew cuts has it been so safe to live and play in the City of Angels .
Believe it : you are more likely to be murdered in Columbus , Ohio , or Tulsa , Okla . , than in the nation ’s second most populous city .
“ You have to go back to 1957 — when I was four years old ! — to find a similar period , ” Charlie Beck , the Los Angeles police chief , was telling me .
“ How crazy is that ? ”
It ’s “ Dragnet ” - level crazy , yes .
But more than that : it ’s one of the great urban surprises in a place that continues to defy its dystopian destiny .
By now , in the midst of a ragged recession , with another half - million people added to its burdened turf over the last 15 years , Los Angeles was supposed to be “ Blade Runner ” in 3 - D .
“ The Book of the Apocalypse Theme Park ” was how the writer Mike Davis described it in his classic 1999 book , the nonfiction horror story “ Ecology of Fear . ”
I count myself among the visitors here who felt a palpable sense of relief flying out of L.A. in 1992 , when riots over a racially charged police brutality verdict left 53 people dead and National Guard troops in the streets .
The sense of menace , of collapse , of utter unsustainability was strong .
What a pit , I thought , and a pity .
The image stuck in my mind was that brutal scene at the intersection of Florence and Normandie , where truck driver Reginald Denny was randomly pulled from his rig and beaten to a pulp by thugs .
All captured live on television .
Since then , homicide is down nearly 80 percent through this year , and overall violent crime has taken a similar plunge .
In 2008 , the last year for full F.B.I. statistics , even Omaha , Neb. , had a slightly higher murder rate than L.A .
And the trend continues : murder in L.A. is now down 50 percent from the relatively placid levels of two years ago .
At this rate , blood - chasing local television news stations will have to import footage from other cities to uphold their reputation for practicing the nation ’s worst and silliest local reporting .
I returned to that morbidly iconic intersection this week and it felt like , well , Omaha on a good day .
Businesses , both chains and family - run storefronts , perked along .
The nearby neighborhoods were mostly graffiti - free , with well - kept yards , churches and schools , and the rarest of real estate tags this year : a “ sold ” sign .
Of course , some dangerous ambient conditions remain .
Chief
Beck says there are still 40,000 gang members here — enough to fill a stadium — but that number is down by half from its peak .
And , on the public relations front , the L.A.P.D. itself stumbled this week when it had to apologize for an insensitive display of evidence at a Las Vegas homicide exhibit , a show that included bloody clothing — since removed — worn by Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy on the night he was assassinated .
Nationwide , the story of crime falling to half - century lows is an ongoing miracle .
How New
York went from the crack - addled days to tourist theme park is well known .
But it ’s a pattern that ’s been repeated all over the United States , with the exception of a few hard patches — cities like New Orleans , Detroit and Baltimore .
The causes are many , and mostly speculative :
A high - tech mapping strategy , where police move on crime hot spots in something close to real time , was pioneered in New York and mastered here ( give praise to William Bratton , who oversaw the departments in both cities , for that effort ) ; the stuffing of prisons with career criminals also gets much of the credit ; the role played by legalized abortion , according to the authors Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner in their book “ Freakonomics , ” in preventing a generation of unwanted children from being born ; and the settling down of the drug trade , the source of so much violence during the formative years of narcotic fiefdoms , to such a degree that in many parts of the city there are now more medical marijuana dispensers in Los Angeles than Starbucks outlets ( regulated retailers creating an ecosystem of nonviolence ) .
The experts foresaw a generation of “ superpredators ” prowling the streets .
Moralizers with microphones predicted imminent social collapse .
And with the Great Recession of 2009 , and particularly 2010 , the positive news would surely end , in the view of James Alan Fox , the oft - cited criminologist .
Did n’t happen .
Has n’t happened .
Probably wo n’t happen .
Everything they knew — all the scary talk , with L.A. as the centerpiece — was wrong .
You saw a glimmer of hope on the day Denny was dragged from his truck .
A resident of that tough neighborhood who had watched the beating live on television risked his own life to get the trucker to the hospital .
The most crime - ridden communities were never as nihilistic as portrayed in 1992 .
But the bad guys did have the upper hand , in part because of the police .
The L.A.P.D. had a notorious reputation — corrupt , racist , incompetent — that made a mockery of its motto to “ protect and serve . ”
Places like South Central Los Angeles were “ a hated landscape , ” says Chief Beck , a 32 - year veteran of the force .
Helicopters constantly buzzed overhead in the harsh sunlight , a soundtrack of dread .
“ It was just pure hatred , on both sides . ”
Chief Beck has seen crime - fighting in Los Angeles — often , an oxymoron at that — through the eyes of three generations : his dad was a cop , and his children are cops as well .
He says these are among the best years ever .
Los Angeles is on a pace for about 230 murders this year , in a city of nearly 4 million people .
And the department clears — solves and prosecutes — more than 80 percent of the homicides , well above the national average for big cities .
Using civil injunctions to cripple many gang activities , and former gang members to bring peace through community outreach , the city has been able to shrink the geography of hatred .
At times , Los Angeles still feels fragile , a sprawl of hubristic nature - defiance , unable to shake its noir sketchiness .
If a half - inch of rain calls for breathless TV updates and canceled social events , what would a serious earthquake do to the hard - won stability of the new civic order ?
Chief Beck has his fingers crossed .
“ Absent some huge social disorder , this will be a golden age of policing , ” he predicted .
“ I have been to every neighborhood of this city and the most popular piece of government now , by far , is the police officer . ”

For Kari Lehtonen ’s new mask after being obtained by the Dallas Stars , Dave Gunnarson produced a remarkable Clint Eastwood tribute – some incredible photorealistic work .
Daveart tells it best :
“ The whole design is created as an old fashion film poster for a cowboy film .
On one side we see Mr Eastwood motifs created in sepia look and golden tints , one with a young Clint and one with a slightly older .
The design is created with a fantastic depth , strongly inspired by Eastwood ’s films , in particular the great film Unforgiven .
The golden base changes into green as we take a look at the other side , where the Dallas Stars logo makes its mark and creates a cool look to the whole .
On this side you can also see a motif of Clint with an ox whip , just like in the film , painted with old school oil paint tech .
The final touch that makes the design complete and creates a new smashing hit design for Lehtonen is the addition of the bullet holes here and there .
A design with extreme detail work created with freehand airbrush technique . ”

Some times we find ourselves at the cross roads of our own anger and thoughts as we start to grow and change our mind set .
We want so bad to grow and be the enlightened thinkers and we place pressure on ourselves to react in ways to things in a positive manner .
Drawing on our inner strengths to see us through the darkness that is constantly waiting to creep up and engulf actions .
It is like a boogie man pulling us back in to the pit of irrational behaviors and mind boggled assertions of demanding to be understood or heard for the wisdom we think should be respected .
We have struggled so hard to dig ourselves out of these frames that seem to gloat at us like past demons laughter .
At these times when we fall we find that our true doughty attitudes have a way of coming back to haunt the actions we have taken to send those feelings away .
A man once said the sea of knowledge is contaminated with provocation and will drive you insane if you but drink a sip .
When we are growing spiritually and mentally to the enlightened stage of how to think not what to think .
We see ourselves in a battle with the past , present , and future .
We are solders of the positive warring against the negatives that seems to have greater armies than ours at times .
As self promoters of where we want our lives to be and those successes we will achieve .
When we fall we need to see the fall for what it is and control the descent .
To stop being blinded by the flash of clouded clutter and illogical thinking or others lack of vision to the greater possibilities that may be just three feet from where we stopped digging for the gold .
As thinking wise men and women starting to have thoughts , never dreamed possible .
We are but shells as to becoming new beings born again to a wide world of people with like minded dreams and desire .
Big thinkers , big dreamers , big believers in vision focus and a real reality .
Not some thing false negative pulled over our eyes as to how it is .
Fake laws put in place demanding we not make waves .
Your wants , dreams , and wishes and new wisdom at times will be attacked so harshly from all sides by those who float in small vassals , that lack the vision as to how the bigger ships that speed by are powered with industrial mind sets of positive actions .
Well their minds are still chained to the oars of years of failure and frustration .
It is these small thinkers who will tear you down at every turn with words of negative emotion .
Saying .
1 . I do n’t see how you will succeed or you can make that work !
2 . Are you sure this is not a scam
3 . I ’ll ask you for advice however will not use it .
Then later say when I have failed that you are wrong .
4 . I really need help however I am not willing to do the work involved that help demands .
5 . I ’ll wait and see what you make , how good the job is , and let you do all the hard work building it first .
Then if you do well Ill be ready to ride the gravy train with you .
Reap the rewards with out the struggle .
6 . It all sounds good however if it does not drop in my lap then how good can it really be ?
7 . I looked at what you are doing , there is no way you are making a living doing that .
8 . People telling other people advice when they have nothing or can not back up what they preach .
9 . Who are you and do you really deserve a big house or nice things .
10 .
Just stop now before you have problems or fail .
The fact is there are thousands of ways for those small chained to the oar thinkers to make you swim .
However it is all in the focus and vision you make for yourself that will see you through to high performance levels you want to achieve .
Those times of falling or anger as to the demands of negative thinkers around you will always be there battling for your mind and will hoping beyond anything you by their duck quaking nonsense .
It is for you the enlighten person to rise above and away from that and those type people .
If you think like an swan and believe you are more than an ugly duck you will become a swan .
If you let other ducks quack and hang out with them letting them say your just an ugly duckling and you believe it .
Then at every turn no matter what you seek to achieve or want you will be that ugly duck to yourself and to those around you .
We are all swans we just have to believe and have faith that it is so .
Then work to make it so .

Father stopped from taking picture of his son , 4 , on children 's train ride ' in case he was a paedophile '
A father was stopped from taking a photo of his son on a children 's train ride after an over - zealous security guard accused him of being a paedophile .
Kevin Geraghty - Shewan , 48 , was approached by the guard after he took the picture of his four - year - old son Ben on the toy engine outside a shop .
He was then threatened with arrest after refusing to hand his mobile phone containing the picture after a row with a policeman .
Furious : Kevin Geraghty - Shewan was stopped from photographing his son Ben , 4 , on this train ride after a security guard said he could be a paedophile
Mr Geraghty - Shewan said : ' Ben saw a children 's ride which had a train on it and wanted to have a go because he 's obsessed with trains . '
Moments later , he was apprehended by the security guard .
The father - of - one , who was in the North East visiting family , said : ' He said " you ca n't take pictures in here " .
I asked why and he told me it was because for all he knew I could be a paedophile .
' I told him Ben Was my son .
But he said I could n't prove it .
' I could n't believe it .
I walked away and then I thought about making a complaint . '
A few minutes later a police officer arrived at the Bridges Shopping Centre in Sunderland and threatened to delete the photograph .
' They said I matched the description of a man who had been taking pictures , ' Mr Geraghty - Shewan said .
Complaint : Mr Geraghty - Shewan was threatened with arrest after refusing to hand over his mobile phone with the picture on it
' They took my details and said they had the right to remove the picture from my phone .
' I got annoyed and things got heated , then he threatened me with arrest for breach of the peace .
' Ben thought I was in trouble because he had sat on the ride and we did n't put the money in . '
Mr Geraghty - Shewan was so annoyed by the incident he posted a picture of the security guard on his blog .
A spokesman for the Bridges Shopping Centre said : ' We take the safety at all our shopping centres very seriously .
' We do ask our security guards across the estate to be diligent in implementing our security measures , which includes monitoring photography in our centres .
' Unfortunately on this occasion what should have been a simple polite conversation led to a misunderstanding and we apologise for any offence caused .
' It is always our aim to implement our security procedures with the minimum of fuss and disruption to our shoppers . '
A spokesman for Northumbria Police said : ' We received reports of a disagreement over a photo taken on the premises of a shopping centre .
No offence took place .'
For the best experience on the VoyeurWeb , you need to update your browser
Google announced Tuesday that its Chrome Web browser will integrate Adobe 's Flash plug - in .
The latest version of Flash will ship with Google 's Web browser , obviating the need for end users to download and install it separately .
Google will also start regularly deploying new versions of Flash through Chrome 's update system in order to ensure that users always have the latest version .
Google has also revealed that it will be working closely with Adobe , Mozilla , and other players in the Web ecosystem to improve the API that browsers use to support plugins .
Such improvements could potentially help ameliorate some of the technical deficiencies that have plagued Flash and other plugins .
A new version of Chrome with the integrated Flash plug - in was rolled out yesterday to users of the Chrome developer channel .
The Flash integration is not enabled by default because it is still highly experimental .
It can be turned on by activating Chrome with the — enable - internal - flash parameter at the command line .
The new developer version of Chrome also has a new plugin management interface that can be used to toggle which plugins are active .
Can Flash be fixed ?
Although the Flash plug - in is widely used on the Internet , it is strongly disliked by a growing number of users .
Websites like YouTube are seeing strong demand for adoption of standards - based alternatives to Flash .
There are signs that disdain for Adobe 's plug - in is becoming increasingly mainstream and is no longer just confined to the community of technology enthusiasts and standards advocates .
This trend is largely driven by the fundamental technical failings of Adobe 's technology .
The Flash plug - in is often criticized for its awful browser integration , poor performance ( especially on Mac OS X and Linux ) and stability , lack of conduciveness to accessibility , and excessive resource consumption .
Another major problem is its frequent security vulnerabilities , which have made it a major target for exploits .
Adobe deserves much of the blame for Flash 's defects , but the problem is also largely attributable to the underlying limitations of the framework that browsers use to enable plug-ins .
The original browser plug - in system , which is called the Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface ( NPAPI ) was first introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 .
It is a historical irony that Adobe itself played a key role in influencing the earliest development of the plug - in , before even Flash existed .
Several Adobe developers collaborated with Netscape to produce the API so that the nascent Acrobat Reader program could be embedded in the browser and be used to display PDF content on the Internet .
The plug - in architecture was basically designed for the purpose of running an independent program inside of the main browser window , but it has been stretched far beyond its intended capacity by modern plug-ins that attempt to provide a lot more functionality .
Due to the limitations in the design of the plug - in API , Flash has to maintain its own insular universe inside of a rectangle that does n't seamlessly mesh with the rest of the page .
Referred to as the " plug - in prison " phenomenon , this limitation has created a lot of barriers to making plug-ins like Flash operate as a native part of the Web .
You can see its detrimental impact on the browsing experience in many areas — such as scrolling , keyboard navigation , text selection , and resizing — where Flash content simply does n't conform with the expected behavior .
Improving the API
Mozilla and other major stakeholders have been working on an update to the plug - in API with the aim of improving the situation .
It wo n't even come close to fixing all the problems with Flash , but it will begin to address certain critical issues .
According to the documentation that has been published so far , the update will attempt to boost consistency between implementations , augment support for out - of - process plug-ins , and improve the way that plugin rendering integrates with browser compositing in order to fix layering glitches .
There will also hopefully be some opportunities along the way for improving performance , stability , and security .
Mozilla started publicly working on it last year .
Google has now affirmed its intention to join the effort and contribute to improving browser support for plug-ins .
" The browser plug - in interface is loosely specified , limited in capability and varies across browsers and operating systems .
This can lead to incompatibilities , reduction in performance and some security headaches , " wrote Chrome engineering VP Linus Upson in Google 's official Chromium blog .
" That 's why we are working with Adobe , Mozilla and the broader community to help define the next generation browser plug - in API .
This new API aims to address the shortcomings of the current browser plug - in model .
Google 's interest in this effort seems somewhat inconsistent with the company 's affinity for emerging native Web standards , but there are several relevant factors to consider .
It 's worth noting that Google itself has implemented its own browser plug-ins , such as the Native Client ( NaCL ) technology .
Improvements that Google contributes to the NPAPI could potentially be beneficial for NaCL , enabling Google to use it in ways that might not otherwise be possible or practical .
Another relevant factor is the potential opportunity for ChromeOS .
Strong support for Flash could potentially look like a competitive advantage for ChromeOS - based devices relative to Apple 's competing products .
Are plug-ins still relevant ?
Although there is clearly an opportunity for Adobe and browser vendors to make Flash behave better on the Web , it may never be a first - class part of the Internet .
Indeed , one could argue that the idea of a proprietary vendor - controlled plug - in that loads interactive components into a Web page from a binary blob is fundamentally antithetical to the underlying design of the Web .
As the standards process accelerates and previously weak browsers like Internet Explorer start to catch up and deliver support for the latest functionality , the need for plug-ins is rapidly declining .
As an example of the growing viability of the standards process , consider the nascent WebGL standard , which has gained broad acceptance and multiple implementations in a very short period of time .
There is no technical reason that prevents Adobe from participating in the Web like a good citizen .
Instead of maintaining a plug - in , the company could propose new functionality for Web standards , contribute implementations to open source browsers , and then target its authoring tools to support those capabilities .
The vast majority of companies that are involved in the Web ecosystem are committed to extending the Web in that manner because it 's simply more consistent with how the Web works .
Now that all of the major browsers , including IE , are aggressively adopting emerging standards , the value of plug-ins is not as clear - cut as it once was .
It appears that the primary reason why Adobe still pursues a plugin - based strategy at this stage is so that it can preserve the vendor lock - in that is inherent in having a proprietary plug -in .
Civil servants who continued working during yesterday 's national strike have revealed they were told to pretend to be answering machines to cope with an overload of calls from the public .
Staff at the Department for Work and Pensions in Carlisle said today they were given a brief script to read out before hanging up , in the style found on telephone answering machines .
The instruction by managers was initially leaked on Facebook after chitchat between strikers and colleagues who had stayed at work .
One worker said : " To begin with , we all found it hard to keep a straight face , and occasionally , I slipped up and I ended up giving my name to the person who was calling . "
The staff said their fake - robot message was issued for peak lunchtime , between midday and 2 pm .
The script read : " Due to the high volume of enquiries we are currently experiencing we are unable to take your call .
Please call back later . "
The clerical worker said : " I believe the idea was that we would have difficulty coping because of the strike , but it just seems like a silly way to handle the problem .
We were asking why they did n't just prepare a proper answering message saying we could n't answer calls because of the industrial action .
It just seemed wrong to hang up on people . "
A spokeswoman for the DWP did not confirm the instruction but said : " Due to a high volume of customer calls yesterday between 12 pm and 2 pm some customers were asked to call back after 2 pm .
Otherwise the majority of our customers had their calls and requests dealt with immediately and in the usual manner . "
On the picket line outside the Carlisle offices , which serve Cumbria , Jennifer Wright , branch organiser for the Public and Commercial Services Union , said : " Pretending to be an answering machine is hardly good customer service .
Some people may have been sitting waiting for the phone to be answered for 10 minutes – and they 're not ringing up just for a chat , they 've usually got important questions . "
The court heard Marium Varinauskas had been drinking heavily A man who assaulted a female police officer with his penis has been fined .
Marium Varinauskas , 28 , tried to strike the officer on the head with his penis when she was called out to his flat , but she got out of the way .
Lithuanian Varinauskas admitted a charge of assault at Aberdeen Sheriff Court and was fined £ 600 .
The court heard he had been drinking heavily and could not remember committing the offence at his home in Aberdeen .
Police were called to his home by his girlfriend , who had complained about him being drunk last November .
They arrived to find the self - employed engineer sitting on the sofa wearing a pair of underpants .
He apologises profusely and is extremely embarrassed
John Hardie
Defence solicitor Fiscal depute Elaine Lynch said : " The accused got to his feet and was standing over the police officer exposing his penis and thrusting it in her face , forcing her to take evasive action to avoid getting struck . "
Defence solicitor John Hardie said : " He was sitting on the couch drunk with his pants on .
" He ca n't remember anything but accepts that if that 's what the police say then that 's what happened .
" He has never been so drunk before that day and accepts he has to take full responsibility .
He apologises profusely and is extremely embarrassed . "
His not guilty plea to committing a breach of the peace by uttering offensive and sexual remarks was accepted by the Crown .
Sheriff Annella Cowan was told that the Lithuanian had now quit binge drinking because of the incident .

One of the key pieces of equipment if you are a soccer player ( football if you are in Europe ) are the cleats .
You need to have the right designed sole and the right pattern of studs and it still needs to be comfortable .
When choosing the best football cleats , it is very important you actually try a few on before you settle on anything .
Sometimes the more expensive ones will be a little more comfortable than the cheaper because of the better materials they use and the extra style features they include , but if you are on a lower budget this does not mean you have to settle for cleats that do not fit well .
Also it is worth noting that while the top makers likes Puma , Adidas , Nike , Umbro or Reebok do have expensive options they also have options in the lower cost ranges too .
When you do buy your chosen cleats remember to keep them on in the house for a while before you play in them so that you can break them in .
Avoid hard surfaces though like concrete which can cause wear on the studs .
Choosing football cleats involves more than just finding ones that are the right size .
There are different turf types and conditions that affect the type of soccer shoe you should be looking at .
What you would wear on an artificial turf is not the same as what you require for natural turf .
You need different football cleats for indoors and outdoors , for soft ground and hard ground .
Choosing football cleats will be a lot easier if you understand the different types that are out there .
You may realize in fact that you need more than one pair .
Choosing The Best Football Cleats
Molded cleats – Permanent and Firm for Outdoor Play
From beginner players to advanced , everyone will need a pair of soccer cleats for outdoors .
Wearing these means you have more control over how you move and that there is enough traction to ensure you also have control over the ball .
There are various patterns you can get and ideally you should get either hard plastic or rubber .
While each brand will have their own styles the two brands that dominate are Adidas and Nike .
The top cleat for Adidas is the Predator shoes and for Nike it is the Vapor , which also happen to be the lightest you can get .
These shoes are good because they are suitable for wet or dry conditions , synthetic turf or grass .
Flat surfaced cleats – For Indoor Play
When you play indoors you need to have a good level of support from your shoes with enough traction and grip .
Flat surfaced cleats offer this and will let you be quick still while maintaining ball control .
They are light shoes to allow for better movement which is also important as indoor soccer often has more side to side movement .
They can have uppers made from synthetic leather or genuine leather but you should check that the stitching is very strong .
The sole is made from rubber .
Leather is a good option as it is durable so your shoes will last longer .
In most indoor soccer cleats you will find the midsole and upper are the same but the outsole is different .
Make sure you check the quality or condition of that outsole especially .
Turf and Plain are the two types of indoor soccer cleats you can get .
Turf can be identified by the sole patterns put there to stop slipping , especially suited for play on artificial turf .
Plain indoor cleats have a sole that is flat , hard rubber made to offer more support on gym floors .
They offer more stabilization while still letting you be flexible in your movement .
It can be difficult to know when choosing football cleats which to buy , turf or plain .
Plain let you stay closer to the ball offering more control .
Turf gives more traction and is effective on any surface apart from grass .
Rubber sole cleats – For Artificial Turf
For play on artificial turf you cannot use soccer shoes that have studs , it has to be ones that have rubber soles .
These are the ones mentioned above that can also be used for indoor play .
On the sole is a raised pattern to ensure the shoe gives the player enough support .
These shoes are great for training purposes too .
Another benefit if this shoe is that if a player has an injury to the ankle , back or knee these offer pain relief as the pressure is dispersed over the whole foot .
They are not good for wet conditions though as grass will get stuck to the cleats leading to no traction and increasing the chance of injury to the player .
The leading turf cleats are from Nike who designed them with sole plates that have three sizes of studs that have been made hollow .
To lead to the cleats digging in deeper to the artificial surface than other shoes do the rubber infill goes into the hollows .
This allows the player to have more stability and be more balanced as they move .
Only
Nike offer this feature at the moment though you can be sure that other manufacturers will come out with their own versions soon .
Detachable Cleats – Soft Removable for Soft Surfaces
For more skillful players in the intermediate to advanced range these cleats can be used for playing on soft surfaces .
With experience a player can tailor their shoes to the weather and the filed style they are playing on .
Also if the weather is wet the field can become slippery and that requires a specific type of studs .
When you are playing on muddy fields the studs can be adjusted by screwing them on or off .
Replacing them is easy and you can get either plastic or metal studs .
Most are wide to help with the mud and usually there are four in the mid and two at the heel .
That is one of the reason these should not be used for hard grounds as 6 studs is not enough to give the player support on hard surfaces and an injury could happen .
In terms of cost these are the more expensive ones you can get so if this is the type of cleat you are considering it would be a good idea to just go for a high quality one and consider it an investment .
Read review of the best soft ground soccer cleats to find the right cleat .
Understanding the types of football cleats there are will help you choose the best shoes for your needs .
Whatever level you play at having the right support is key to avoiding injury as well as having the kind of stability , flexibility and movement you need .
Your ball control can be affected by quite a bit if you do not have the right soccer shoes .
Google has added the OAuth standard to Gmail in a move to tighten up the security of its email accounts when a user authorises a third party developer to see their contacts list .
The feature is now available to developers via the Google Code Labs website .
Previously a user wanting to provide their contacts to a third party website or app such as Facebook were required to authorise that platform to access their Google account password .
OAuth stamps out that requirement , said Google 's senior product manager Eric Sachs in a blog post yesterday .
" Most Google APIs support this OAuth standard , and starting today it is also available for the IMAP / SMTP feature of Gmail , " he said .
Google added that it was working with Yahoo ! and Mozilla on " a formal Internet standard for using OAuth with IMAP / SMTP " .
It said SmartPush application developer Syphir was one of the first outfits to use the feature for Apple 's iPhone .
" Unlike other push apps , Sypher 's SmartPush application never sees or stores the user ’s Gmail password thanks to this new OAuth support , " said Sachs . ®
So , you do n’t want to share your super - special non-dairy creamer / handsoap with the rest of the office ?
You could go for the semi-direct approach …
But as Ocie in Petaluma , California witnessed , that might not be enough of a deterrent .
In that case , you could try to dial up the crazy a little more , like Nicole in Florida …
Or you just might have to get a little bit creative .

As drivers await the arrival of General Motors 's much - anticipated Chevy Volt plug - in hybrid car later this year , GM unveiled an electric vehicle of an entirely different stripe on Wednesday at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai .
The company 's Electric Networked Vehicle ( EN - V ) is a mini electric vehicle built for two , unless you are using it to go shopping , in which case you might have room for yourself and a bag of groceries .
Working with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. Group ( SAIC ) , GM designed the EN - V to meet the challenges of getting around major metropolises as urban populations swell .
The EN - V resembles more an enclosed pedicab — minus the bike — than it does a car .
In fact , the 1.5 - meter - long vehicle is three times shorter than a typical car and weighs less than 500 kilograms , one third as much as most cars on the road today .
The EN - V relies on dynamic stabilization technology similar to that of the one - person Segway scooter to keep its balance , and can be operated autonomously or under manual control .
In autonomous mode the EN - V is designed to use high - speed wireless connectivity and GPS navigation to automatically select the fastest route , based on real - time traffic conditions gleaned from the Web or some other networked source of traffic information .
Although the EN - V is currently only a concept vehicle , GM 's goal is to equip them with sensors for autonomous functioning — helping drivers park and even avoid collisions .
The vehicles are also expected to include systems that allow drivers to talk to other EN - V drivers while on the road .
The EN - V is powered by lithium ion batteries that can last up to 40 kilometers between charges , and the vehicle is designed to be plugged into a standard wall outlet for recharging .
GM also styled its EN - V prototypes — which have a top speed of 40 kilometers per hour — to appeal to urban professionals on the move .
The vehicle 's body and canopy are constructed from carbon fiber , custom tinted plastics , and acrylic , which the company says makes it light but durable .
By 2030 , more than 60 percent of the world 's population will be living in urban areas , says Chris Borroni - Bird , GM 's director of advanced technology vehicle concepts .
In densely populated cities around the world , including New York City , " driving is not a practical way of moving around , " he says , adding that a third of city congestion is typically caused by drivers looking for parking spaces .
Several cities , including Athens , México City and Bogotá , Colombia , have resorted to " road space rationing , " allowing a vehicle to enter the city only on certain days ( or during rush hour ) , based on whether its license plate number ends in an odd or even number .
Borroni-Bird compares today 's cars with 1980s - era PCs , which were clunky and largely operated without any network connections .
Continuing that analogy , EN - V is like the smart phones and other wireless handheld devices that today keep people connected around the clock .
The EN - V evolved from the Segway - based Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility ( PUMA ) prototype that GM introduced about a year ago .
PUMA weighed 136 kilograms , ran on a lithium ion battery and could travel at speeds up to 56 kilometers per hour , with a range up to 56 kilometers between recharges .
The EN - V's additional weight comes courtesy of its upgraded chassis and the electronics that support the automated driving system ( the PUMA did not operate autonomously ) .
This weight , plus the more complex electronics , play a role in the EN - V's slower top speed and shorter range between charges .
Borroni-Bird acknowledges that the EN - V will be a tougher sell in U.S. cities , where a significant portion of people have grown accustomed to traversing the streets fully enclosed in weatherproof cars , trucks and buses .
More likely , the EN - V will appeal more in places such as Mumbai and Shanghai , where urbanites are more used to walking and biking around their cities .
" This vehicle would n't be as much of an outlier in other countries as it would be in the U.S. , " he adds .
Places like New York City might require bigger versions of the EN - V or perhaps a dedicated travel lane such as those available for cyclists .
Jamie Leigh Jones AP Jamie Leigh Jones claims she was raped by fellow Halliburton employees when she was working in Iraq in 2005 .
Her allegations are not pretty -- she claims she was given a drink , after which she remembers nothing .
In legal filings and Congressional testimony , Slate noted , she said she woke up to find " her body naked and severely bruised , with lacerations to her vagina and anus , blood running down her leg , her breast implants ruptured and her pectoral muscles torn‚ which would later require reconstructive surgery . "
Parts of the rape kit handed over to KBR by the Army hospital have disappeared and she said that , after visiting the Army hospital , she was placed in a shipping container under armed guard for 24 hours .
Jones employment contract with Halliburton ( now known as KBR ) contained an arbitration clause that required " any and all personal injury claims " to be heard by an arbitrator .
Jones eventually refused to arbitrate , wanting her lawsuit to be heard in court .
The Fifth Circuit eventually held that some of Jones 's claims did indeed belong in court because the assault was not related to her employment .
KBR had appealed the decision to the Supreme Court , but , after initial briefing , withdrew its appeal on March 11 .
Why ?
Sen. Al Franken !
Franken successfully advocated a prohibition that keeps contractors receiving federal defense funds from forcing employees to arbitration to resolve certain claims , including civil rights and harassment disputes .
KBR spokesperson Heather Browne told the Blog of the Legal Times that the withdrawal was in fact related to the Franken amendment .
Though they said they believe " that the language of the amendment is broad and vague , " they did not wish to run afoul of it .
Jones 's attorney said they are now preparing for trial .

Russell King provides some :
You can't demand everyone listen to the generals when they say what fits your agenda , and then ignore them when they do n't .
You can't whine that it 's unfair when people accuse you of exploiting racism for political gain , when your party 's former leader admits you 've been doing it for decades .
You can't portray yourself as fighting terrorists when you openly and passionately support terrorists .
You can't complain about a lack of bipartisanship when you 've routinely obstructed for the sake of political gain -- threatening to filibuster at least 100 pieces of legislation in one session , far more than any other since the procedural tactic was invented -- and admitted it .
Some admissions are unintentional , others are made proudly .
This is especially true when the bill is the result of decades of compromise between the two parties and is filled with your own ideas .
New Study Shows Boys Lagging Behind Girls in Reading Boys are struggling with reading in all 50 states .
March 17 , 2010  --
Girls are reading better than boys , according to a new study by the Center on Education Policy , and the pattern is giving girls a life - long advantage , experts tell ABC News .
Boys are lagging behind girls on standardized reading tests in all 50 states , the research suggests .
In some states , the boys are trailing girls by as much as 10 percentage points .
While girls best boys in reading throughout the country , the genders are evenly split when it came to proficiency in math .
In past years , boys had a decided advantage over girls in math .
The study looked at trends beginning in 2002 and ending in 2008 .
" The cause for concern is that this is an unmistakable and clear trend , a national trend , " said Jack Jennings , president of the Center on Education Policy .
" Mainly , we found no state in which boys did not lag behind girls in reading at the elementary level , the middle level and the high school level .
So it 's pretty clear : Boys are not doing as well as girls in reading . "
In Virginia and New Hampshire , middle school girls did better than boys in reading proficiency by 15 percentage points .
In New York , girls were 13 percentage points ahead .
" In the past , boys did not do better in the first couple years of school , " Jennings said .
" Girls did better .
But then boys caught up .
The difference now is we 're finding that boys are not catching up . "
At the Ronald McNair High School in New Jersey , English teacher Don Dello said he sees the difference .
" I think in an English classroom , there 's always been a tendency for the girls to be more interested in literature than the boys , " Dello said .
So why the gap ?
For reading , one theory points to differences between the brains of boys and girls .
While girls ' brains are more verbally oriented , often making reading skills easier for them , boys ' brains are visually oriented .
Another theory is that boys are more physically restless than girls .
Even recess time has been cut in some schools in the push for better achievement test scores .
" [ Boys ] can read , but they need to be moving around or they need to be doodling , they need to be doing something that 's activating their brains , " said Dr. Michael Gurian , a family therapist .
Long - Term Consequences
The problem extends beyond high school .
" There 's a consistent pattern here that says boys are not learning how to read as well as girls , " Jennings said .
" They 're dropping out of school at greater rates than girls .
They 're going to college at lower rates than girls , and they 're getting their college degrees at lower rates than girls . "
The study , Jennings said , is very good for girls .
It shows that they 've done better in the last 20 years than they were doing before .
Unfortunately , for boys , the opposite is true .
How have the girls managed to catch up ?
Some experts credit the women 's movement with girls ' progress in math and reading .
Girls study harder because there are career opportunities and expectations that did not exist for them 30 or 40 years ago when the education gaps looked much different than they do today .
But one of the panelists had an interesting assessment - that if we do not make rational reforms , we are heading for a catastrophic financial failure of the health care system in the next 24 months .
However , he did not think that health care reform would pass , and that the health insurance system would move rapidly into the financial collapse scenario .
That is to say that reform would come one way or the other , but he figured it was likely to come with chaos , needless financial loss , and various types of suffering .
But what about innovation ?
It seems the writing is on the wall and that we are headed towards a European system with the highest rates of reimbursement for innovative drugs .
The " me too " drugs that have dominated the pharmaceutical industry will be reimbursed at a lower rate .
As a result , biotech startups are expected to fare pretty well as big pharma partners up to obtain novel drugs .
This seems to be part of the Obama 's " secret deal with Big Pharma , " and in this regard sounds pretty darn good .
Update II
Kudos to fly ( uid 488 ! ) for this link to the NY Times , and a pox on the whingers .
In statements and letters , Anthem and WellPoint have explained what the industry calls a recessionary death spiral : as unemployment and declining wages prompt healthy people to drop their insurance , the remaining risk pool becomes sicker and more expensive to insure , which in turn forces up prices and pushes more people out of the market .
A study released this week found that the five largest health insurance companies collectively lost 2.7 million customers last year , including 1.4 million by WellPoint .
Yet they reported record profits of $ 12.2 billion .
The death spiral " highlights why we need sustainable health care reform to manage the steadily rising costs of hospitals , drugs and doctors , " Anthem , which is based in Los Angeles , said in a statement .
Update
As always , it 's worth looking in on the paste eaters at Redstate who always worked up over something .
President Obama has launched an all - out attack on the insurance companies in his new healthcare plan .
Unfortunately for Americans , the private insurance industry is the last thing standing between us and socialized medicine — and as a result , socialism .
Well , too bad nobody in the health industry had declared themselves to be the ramparts of liberty , because that would be some pretty cool marketing .
They could even hire the same ad agency that does those recruiting ads for the Marines .
" We looking for a few good actuaries .... "
And too bad nobody in the GOP has been making that case at the health care summit .
But surely the health insurance industry must be happy to know they have ascended to the sacred status enjoyed by Massey Coal .
Digital book readers are gaining popularity all the time , with Amazon , the major online book retailer , especially keen to push the technology through their own brand of digital book reader .
With the power of Amazon helping to drive it forward the number of digital book readers on the market is growing exponentially .
Despite this growth in popularity many people are unaware of what a digital book reader is , and how it can be used to enhance their own book reading experience .
So let us look into the fundamentals of this technology .
What is a Digital Book Reader ?
A digital book reader is , in essence , a small mobile computer that is able to travel with you wherever you go .
The very essence of it is the ability to travel easily , so they are lightweight and small – designed to be no more than book sized .
The technology is a natural progression from a hand - held PDA .
PDAs are mobile computers designed to help you organise your day and also supported the reading of certain documents .
Digital book readers have progressed that technology and taken the next logical step .
Rather than being an input machine the digital book reader is designed to be a display module ( with some limited input capabilities ) , allowing different formats of files to be shown as text .
These files can be saved to an internal hard drive or use external memory cards that are easily inserted .
These files , as the name suggests , are , in the main , digital books .
Simply put they are the same text as normal books but presented in a digital format for a digital book reader to display on its screen ( which takes up most of the front of the electronic device ) .
Other files can be read , depending on the device , including reports in files such as . txt or .pdf , which have interested many commercial services outside of publishing .
A Difference
It is not simply a case of these devices being mini-computers that let you read books .
While that is an accurate description it is also a simplistic one .
A lot of research and development has gone into these readers to ensure that the reading experience is a comfortable one .
It was discovered that using normal mobile technology to light and display text started hurting the eyes relatively quickly , making it uncomfortable and unlikely to catch on .
This has lead to the development of such technologies as ‘ electronic paper ’ and ‘ electronic ink ’ .
These are designed to allow the readers to be read for long periods ( e.g. while studying ) and still feel as natural and as easy to read as a book .
The change in lighting also makes such devices easy to read in sunlight , which laptops have traditionally struggled in .
Electronic books , also known as ebooks , are available in a number of different formats .
Originally the various hardware developers , such as Sony and Amazon , created proprietary formats so that ebooks bought for their hardware could not be used on other devices , effectively tying people and their ebook collections to the one hardware .
However as more hardware manufacturers have entered the market a general use format has emerged , ePUB .
Sony has changed it ’s recent offerings to include access to this format , as have most manufacturers ( with Amazon the main notable exception ) .
Digital book readers continue to advance as technology changes and improves , but with the expansion of the books available , and the emergence of a standard publishing technology , it looks more and more like the digital book reader is going to be here to stay .
Digital Book Reader Benefits
With the increased popularity of digital book readers comes increased scrutiny .
As it moves out from simply being a gadget that gadget lovers will get and into the mainstream so to must it be questioned for usability and value for money .
Why should you get a digital book reader ?
What benefits does it bring ?
The book has been our medium for reading for hundreds of years , huge collections exist and the book brings a value and feel all of it ’s own .
So for digital book readers to overcome this history and familiarity they are going to have to present some real benefits .
So what benefits can digital book readers bring to users that they do n’t get with the traditional book ?
The first is ease of transport .
Whilst a digital book reader takes up roughly the same size as a book it can in fact store thousands of books inside it ’s ( and any memory card ’s ) data banks .
This means that when you are travelling you do n’t need to pack half a suitcase worth of books , just the one book sized piece of equipment .
It can be of great benefit for online education .
Instantaneous downloads .
Books are hard copy , they need to be picked up from shops or delivered , which means you need to wait .
Electronic Books ( eBooks ) of digital book readers are available for an instantaneous download , meaning you can have what you want in your hands , ready to read as soon as you have bought it .
Storage space .
If you are an avid book reader it can be difficult to find space for all the books that you own .
Many such people end up having to give their books away .
Would n’t it be preferable to instead be able to store it on a tiny little device such as a memory card ?
That is what an eBook can bring .
No need for vast storage areas , or giving away books you may want to read again , just an easy to access and easy to store system that takes up next to no space .
Cost .
Whilst a digital book reader can be somewhat costly the massively reduce cost of ebooks vs traditional books mean that if you are buying books on a frequent , or even semi frequent , basis then you will be saving money .
Wear and tear .
Books traditionally suffer from degradation .
Folding of the pages , yellowing , water damage , tears and more are something that anyone who owns a book is aware of .
With an eBook though they will never suffer such problems as they are stored in digital format .
Whilst it is possible for the digital book reader to get damaged ( though they are sturdy items ) your ebook collection will still be unharmed , and can be transferred to a new book reader if needs be .
File support .
It is possible to read other documents on such readers , such as work reports or newspapers .
It can greatly increase the functionality of the digital book reader over that of a traditional book .
These are the main benefits that most people appreciate with digital book readers .
Other benefits exist and their importance from person to person can vary .
It should be noted that at this point the manufacturers and publishers are not pitching eBooks as something to take over completely from traditional books , just an additional interest that will benefit those that like to read .
New Brands
While Sony and Amazon Kindle are the two biggest names in the digital book reader market , there are a few companies that have developed their own offerings that are fast getting a strong following from users .
As the technology is still in early stages , it is likely we will see a number of ‘ new name ’ companies come and go .
But some will stay around thanks to the strength and popularity of their offerings .
Two of the major up and coming digital book reader companies are featured below , and should be strongly considered as alternatives to the established options .
Cool-er
Cool - er ebook readers are certainly eye catching .
They come in a range of 8 different colors , all of which are very bright and easily spotted .
As one of the latest of the digital book readers to be released the Cool - er has almost all the up - to - date specifications you would expect .
The Cool - er is roughly the same size as the Sony Reader , but is also roughly half the weight , making it far more friendly as a travel companion .
It comes with speakers to allow ebooks to be read to you ( and MP3′s to be played ) and has the good news that it supports the ePub format , fast becoming the industry standard for ebooks .
