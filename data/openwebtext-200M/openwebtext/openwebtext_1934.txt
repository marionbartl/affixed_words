Only Stephen Colbert could turn an ordinary wrist injury into a media crusade , perhaps revealing contrasts among television ’s three evening news anchors along the way .
The Comedy Central host broke his wrist before a taping of “ The Colbert Report ” in June .
He has since made “ wrist violence ” a source of comedy for his character , a self - absorbed television pundit , embarking on a celebrity cast - signing tour and promoting bright red “ WristStrong ” bracelets .
His cast is up for auction on eBay , with proceeds going to a charity for injured service members .
Brian Williams , the “ NBC Nightly News ” anchor , and Katie Couric , the “ CBS Evening News ” anchor , both played along .
But Charles Gibson , anchor of ABC ’s “ World News , ” did not , and some media observers interpreted his recalcitrance as a statement that real news shows are not to be conflated with parodies .
Unlike Mr. Williams or Ms. Couric , Mr. Gibson has never appeared on either Mr. Colbert ’s show or on “ The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . ”
First up , in case you do n't believe me ( and why should you ? ) , here 's why I say we have four days .
First , I saw this :
BOB Baer , the former Middle East CIA operative whose first book about his life inspired the oil - and - espionage thriller Syriana , is working on a new book on Iran , but says he was told by senior intelligence officials that he had better get it published in the next couple of months because things could be about to change .
Baer , in an interview with The Weekend Australian , says his contacts in the administration suggest a strategic airstrike on Iran is a real possibility in the months ahead .
" What I 'm getting is a sense that their sentiment is they are going to hit the Iranians and not just because of Israel , but due to the fact that Iran is the predominant power in the Gulf and it is hostile and its power is creeping into the Gulf at every level , " Baer says .
He says his contacts have told him of his book : " You better hurry up because the thesis is going to change .
I told them submission is in January but they said , ' You 're probably going to be too late ' . "
Then , today , I saw this :
Today I received a message from a friend who has excellent connections in Washington and whose information has often been prescient .
According to this report , as in 2002 , the rollout will start after Labor Day , with a big kickoff on September 11 .
My friend had spoken to someone in one of the leading neo-conservative institutions .
He summarized what he was told this way :
They [ the source 's institution ] have " instructions " ( yes , that was the word used ) from the Office of the Vice - President to roll out a campaign for war with Iran in the week after Labor Day ; it will be coordinated with the American Enterprise Institute , the Wall Street Journal , the Weekly Standard , Commentary , Fox , and the usual suspects .
It will be heavy sustained assault on the airwaves , designed to knock public sentiment into a position from which a war can be maintained .
Evidently they do n't think they 'll ever get majority support for this -- they want something like 35 - 40 percent support , which in their book is " plenty . "
[via this diary ; shame on me for not linking it earlier , I plead busy ]
There 's more at both links , if you care to go track it all down .
My modest and unqualified offerings begin here .
RESPONSE :
Strategic :
We can anticipate three basic thrusts from Bush 's psy-ops war on his fellow Americans .
( Hey , I told you they were predictable ! )
They are Iran's :
Nuclear threat
Connection to international terrorism
Responsibility for American deaths in Iraq
::
Nuclear threat :
Any response must advance your own narrative , not just gainsay the narrative of your opponent .
For this reason , laying out all the technical reasons why Iran 's capacity to build a nuclear weapon lay way off in the next decade would be barking up the wrong tree .
The proper response to Bush and his enablers when they claim an immanent threat from Iran 's nuclear program is to lead with variations on " there they go again . "
The failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq provides the single greatest opportunity we have of preventing the further weakening of America 's military and political position in the world and also preventing further death and destruction .
" There they go again " plays on a sense of inevitability that Bush 's enablers cannot respond to because they do n't want to have that conversation ... ever .
It also throws the focus back on the source of the story : the discredited Bush administration .
Yes , Iran is a different country from Iraq , but the information is coming from that same source that got so many Americans killed in Iraq and has nothing to show for it but a weaker America and a stronger enemy .
The drunk already crashed the Buick .
Now he wants the Chevy .
The proper response is not to give him the Chevy .
What he needs is black coffee and a long time out .
Connection to international terrorism :
This is their weakest hand , so it is only likely to be played in conjunction with #'s 1 & 2 .
Bringing up Iran 's support for groups we call " terrorist " because they 're not the MEK requires that Bush and his enablers invoke events in far away countries at a time when even their base is increasingly concerned with events at home .
There is no need to play the " one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter " game with them , because it will only strengthen a hand that was weak for them .
Instead , it 's useful for any number of purposes to stress how much has n't been done to improve America 's defenses ( especially our ports ) besides putting a 50 cal .
outside a petting zoo in South Carolina .
Why are we still vulnerable to these terrorist networks ?
What the hell has Bush been doing , almost six years into his " War on Terror " ?
Responsibility for American deaths in Iraq :
Bush and his enablers in the corporate media have been hard at work at building this theme in the mind of low - information " US Americans and such as " for some time .
That 's their audience .
The best response is a combination .
First , recall all the times they 've had to backpedal on this one before .
Follow through with a challenge as to why they 've done nothing about Saudi support for our enemies in Iraq .
Delivered properly , this combination will leave you an opening to launch into your own narrative .
How is Bush going to occupy Iran when he can't even manage Iraq ?
How is he going to pay for this ?
Where are the military resources going to come from ?
How will we ever be able to leave Iraq now ?
Sadr just announced a six - month truce , what does an attack on Iran tell the Shi'ites ?
They do n't have any answers .
They have no idea what they 're doing .
That 's why Bush and his enablers can only prey on fear and ignorance .
There is one strategic key to the entire conversation : Bush and his enablers want to talk about big scary Iran in order to build support for a war .
We , on the other hand , want to talk about the war first , because most people do n't want it .
They need to sneak up on the issue of war .
We need to let people know that it 's there now .
Tactical :
Do not use " we " or " us . "
The USA , us / we , are not going to attack Iran , Bush is .
This approach aggravates the right 's increasing isolation AND protects you from " blame America first " distractions .
They 're all alone and everyone hates them .
Make them feel it .
If I see any of you writing about this , saying how big , scary , dangerous , hairy , and tough Bush / the Republicans are , I will secretly reach into your computer and delete all of that novel you 're working on that no one else knows about .
Never say ' ouch ' to a barbarian , it only encourages them .
They do this out of weakness , not strength .
The only thing that makes these isolated and failed bed - wetter who want to bomb Iran look like manly men is some cringing leftie squealing next to them .
Their base eats that up , since they 'll support anything that you hate or fear , even if it means damaging their own country .
Time is not their friend .
Always plan on inevitability .
Bush is on his way out , which is a big part of why he 's going this .
The pro-war fringe .
America has left them behind .
They 're doing this partially out of spite , somewhere between scorched earth and sour grapes .
Bombing brown people because of the bomb they do n't have appeals to only a very small part of America .
They used to hang black people from trees .
Now they have abu Ghraib .
Same thrill .
Bombing Iraq helped them feel better about 9/11 .
Bombing Iran is supposed to help them feel better about Bush 's failure in Iraq .
Corruption .
Laundering money through ginned - up wars is a money - maker for these guys .
It 's the only carrot that keeps Bush 's backers wandering Iraq .
.
Little T woke me up way early this morning , after putting him back to bed I found that I could n't sleep .
Typical , eh ?
I took advantage of the quiet to take a stroll through my blog so far and thought I 'd share some of my favorite activities and projects .
I hope you like them , too !
Who cares about the wording , yes it's not a hack , unless they just mean to " give another use to something besides it 's originally intended use " , halloween decoration to cat scratcher , and the english is horrible , but man this is too funny and really good .
I 'd love one for my dog-and if that means I do n't have enough time for one of the most needy / on top of you 27/7 pets known to man-SO BE IT !
Iraq 's security forces face an uphill struggle
The report says that Iraq has performed satisfactorily on nine out of 18 benchmarks - one more than in July .
Among the failures , it cites militia control over security forces and not enacting laws on sharing oil resources .
The report comes a day after President George W Bush announced a troop withdrawal from Iraq .
He said he had accepted the advice of the US commander in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , who gave his own progress report to Congress earlier this week and said the recent military " surge " in Iraq was working .
Iraq faces daunting challenges ... political progress at the national level has still been disappointing
Benchmark Assessment Report
Verdicts on Iraq progress Reports on Iraq to Congress
Mr Bush 's plan would take troop numbers back to about 130,000 by July 2008 - the level before the build - up began in February .
Speaking after President Bush 's announcement , the Iraqi foreign minister , Hoshyar Zebari , said his government had to move more rapidly towards national reconciliation and political progress .
Mr Zebari said Iraq faced many challenges , from terrorism , from regional intervention and from conflicting interests .
Meanwhile another US government report says that religious freedom in Iraq has sharply deteriorated over the past year .
The annual State Department report on religious freedom said people of all religions and sects in Iraq were subject to harassment , intimidation , kidnapping , and killing .
It blamed the situation on the insurgency .
De-Baathification
The White House report on benchmarks , delivered to Congress , is the Bush administration 's own assessment of the situation in Iraq .
It is one of several recent US reports on Iraq 's progress .

Final Benchmarks Assessment Report [ 128 KB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here
Based on data available as of 1 September 2007 , it says " the Iraqis have made satisfactory progress since January 2007 on nine benchmarks " .
It mentions improvement in only one area compared with the initial assessment by the White House in July - reconciling former members of Saddam Hussein 's Baath Party .
The report says more than 45,000 former army personnel have already been granted pensions or reinstated to active duty .
Among the targets where the Iraqi government had made satisfactory progress were :
forming a constitutional review committee and completing the review
enacting and implementing legislation on de-Baathification
legislation in semi-autonomous regions
But failure was registered in meeting seven benchmarks , including :
the equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources
increasing the number of Iraqi security forces able to operate independently
ensuring that Iraq 's political authorities are not undermining or making false accusations against foreign forces
The report also said it was too early to assess two benchmarks - amnesty legislation and a militia disarmament programme .
Overall , the White House paints a mixed picture but admits that progress by the national government has been disappointing , the BBC's Jane O'Brien in Washington says .
The report does , however , offers justification for an enduring relationship with the Iraqi government , our correspondent says .
' Beyond benchmarks '
In August , the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) - a Congressional watchdog - said Iraq had met only three out of the 18 benchmarks .
Pressure is growing on Mr Bush to reduce the US presence in Iraq
The Bush administration later challenged the report , saying the GAO portrayed the situation only in " blacks and whites " and ignored " grey " areas of progress .
After the release of the latest report , the White House said that even though Iraqis had failed to pass key national legislation , " the objectives of such laws are in some ways already being achieved " in practice .
Oil revenues , for instance , were being shared equally , it said , " even if the formal benchmarks themselves have not been met " .
And it said that US efforts in Iraq extended far beyond the 18 benchmarks .
" We continue to work with the Iraqis to establish the strategic environment in which security and meaningful reconciliation can develop and take root - in ways not easily measured by these benchmarks , " the statement said .
Nor are they eager to tar the vast array of government hospitals and clinics that serve our nation ’s veterans .
For one thing , the veterans ’ hospitals , once considered a second - rate backwater , now lead their private sector competitors in adopting electronic medical records and score well for delivering high quality care at relatively low cost .
Even when the veterans ’ hospitals were rightly criticized this year for their part in the disgraceful failure to care adequately for soldiers injured in Iraq and Afghanistan , there was no clamor to junk or privatize the system , only demands to make it better .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg startled most New Yorkers two years ago when he asserted that the city ’s public hospitals are “ better than the great teaching hospitals ” all around them .
Although some deemed his praise hyperbolic , the city ’s billionaire , entrepreneurial , free - market - enriched mayor thought he knew quality when he saw it , even if it was socialist at its core .
The country ’s vast Medicare program is one step less socialized — a “ single - payer ” program in which the government pays for the care and sets reimbursement rates , but the actual care is delivered by private doctors and hospitals .
When Medicare was launched in 1965 it was routinely denounced as socialized medicine , but it has become so popular that politicians deem it the third rail of American politics , sure to electrocute anyone who tries to cut it or privatize it .
No politician is eager to brand 43 million beneficiaries as socialists at heart .
Meanwhile , the two current butts of the “ s- word ” are such hybrids of public and private elements that it is hard to know how to characterize them .
The State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , or S - chip , was denigrated by one Republican congressman this week as “ a government - run socialized wolf masquerading in the sheep skin of children ’s health . ”
It might better be thought of as a “ double - payer system ” in which the states and the federal government put up the money , the states take the lead in defining the program and the actual care is typically delivered through private health plans by private doctors and hospitals .
The “ s - word ” seems even less appropriate for Senator Clinton ’s proposed universal health care plan , which seeks to bolster employer - provided health benefits and create new purchasing pools to help individuals buy private policies at low group rates .
New York City , moving swiftly in the face of outrage from the White House to the political hustings to the Jewish community , is opposing a request by President Ahmadinejad to lay a wreath at ground zero when the Iranian is in New York next week for a meeting of the United Nations .
Click Image to Enlarge Behrouz Mehri / AFP / Getty President Ahmadinejad addresses the parliament on Iran 's fourth development plans in Tehran , September 17 , 2007 .
After a spokesman for the National Security Council in the White House said that a decision on Mr. Ahmadinejad 's visit was up to New York City , the police department put out a statement saying that the idea for a visit into the pit at ground zero had been quickly dismissed earlier this month in a mid-level meeting among aides of the police department , the Secret Service , and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey .
" This is a matter for the City of New York to resolve , " a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House , Gordon Johndroe , said .
He added pointedly : " It seems odd that the president of a country that is a state sponsor of terror would visit ground zero . "
Minutes later , Bloomberg administration officials were saying privately that a visit by Mr. Ahmadinejad anywhere near ground zero was " not going to happen . "
New Yorkers on both sides of the political spectrum were outraged at the idea that the Iranian president would approach the spot where thousands died in the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
The news also briefly halted the sparring among the most prominent candidates on the presidential campaign trail .
In a rare moment of unity , Senator Clinton , Governor Romney , Mayor Giuliani , Senator Obama , and a former senator running for president , Fred Thompson , each made statements against the proposed ground zero visit , saying it would dishonor the memory of those who died there .
" It is unacceptable for Iranian President Ahmadinejad , who refuses to renounce and end his own country 's support of terrorism , to visit the site of the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil in our nation 's history , " Mrs. Clinton said in a statement .
Mr. Obama said ground zero " must not be a backdrop for President Ahmadinejad to posture . "
" An insult to the memory of those who died on 9/11 at the hands of terrorists , and those who have fought terrorism for years " :
That is how a spokeswoman for Mr. Thompson , Karen Hanretty , characterized the proposed visit .
Mr. Romney , a Republican candidate , called the plan " shockingly audacious , " while Mr. Giuliani called it " outrageous . "
Still , the NYPD has little say over Mr. Ahmadinejad 's movements while he is here as long as he stays within 25 miles of Columbus Circle , meaning he could go to ground zero if he chooses during his visit , sources said .
Under the terms of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement , America as the host country must protect all foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visit the U.N. while they are in New York .
" That 's what 's entitled to them by law , " a spokeswoman for the Secret Service , Kim Bruce , said .
She also said the Secret Service has no say over itineraries , except to advise foreign missions of any security risks dignitaries may face during their travels .
" They make those decisions , we do n't make those decisions , " Ms. Bruce said of the foreign missions .
New York City 's police commissioner , Raymond Kelly , confirmed yesterday that both federal and city law enforcement have been quietly discussing the request to escort Mr. Ahmadinejad to ground zero during his visit .
Mr. Kelly , at a routine press appearance at police headquarters yesterday , indicated discussions were under way over Mr. Ahmadinejad 's desire to visit ground zero during a two - day trip to address the world body as the Security Council considers issuing stricter sanctions for Iran 's uranium enrichment program .
Mr. Ahmadinejad is scheduled to arrive on Sunday and leave Wednesday .
Mr. Kelly said the NYPD and Secret Service were in discussions with the Iranian Mission about the logistics for the possible visit to ground zero , and whether it would take place at all .
" There has been some interest expressed in his visiting the area , " Mr. Kelly said .
" It 's something that we are prepared to handle if in fact it does happen . "
He added during the news conference that Mr. Ahmadinejad would not be allowed to descend into the pit for safety reasons related to ongoing construction at the site .
Later in the afternoon , an NYPD spokesman , Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne , issued a statement saying the police department would oppose Mr. Ahmadinejad 's request to visit the area around ground zero and said it had refused Mr. Ahmadinejad 's request earlier this month to enter the pit .
" Requests for the Iranian president to visit the immediate area would also be opposed by the NYPD on security grounds , " he said .
There may be a number of grounds for restrictions to be laid on the Iranian leader .
Individuals may be denied a visa to come to New York under the terms of the Immigration and Nationality Act , which can bar a visit for national security reasons , according a State Department official who requested anonymity .
A recent example is the case of Ali Reza Moaiyeri , Iran 's ambassador to the U.N. institutions in Geneva , Switzerland .
The State Department confirmed yesterday that Mr. Moaiyeri was barred from joining the Iranian delegation to the U.N. General Assembly next week .
But the restrictions under the Immigration and Nationality Act have never been applied to a head of state .
" We are the host here .
Just because we do n't like somebody , we can't refuse them entry to the United Nations , " the State Department official said .
Mr. Ahmadinejad 's visit to the United Nations will be his third to New York City in two years .
A visit to ground zero would mark the first time he or any other Middle Eastern leader made an official visit to the site of the September 11 terrorist attacks , according to Mr. Kelly .
Iran has been called the world 's " most active state sponsor of terrorism " by the U.S. State Department .
Mr. Ahmadinejad has suggested the Holocaust never happened and said that Israel should be " wiped off the map . "
In the spring , Mr. Ahmadinejad was forced to cancel a planned visit to the United Nations because visas for his delegation arrived too late .
A spokesman for the State Department , Kurtis Cooper , said he did n't know if Mr. Ahmadinejad had received his visa for the upcoming visit and said the state department had no role in overseeing his trip to New York .
As for his plan to visit ground zero , Mr. Cooper added : " It is appalling to think that the president Ahmadinejad , one of the world 's leading sponsors of terrorism , would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground . "
The Iranian mission to the United Nations , which made the original request to the NYPD and Secret Service on September 6 , did not respond to e-mails and phone messages requesting comment .
After news broke of the Iranian 's request to visit ground zero , a vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations , Malcolm Hoenlein , said a visit by Mr. Ahmadinejad " would violate the sanctity of the sacred place and the memory of those who perished there . "
Mr. Hoenlein is among those who were already organizing a protest against the Iranian leader Monday in front of the United Nations .
He suggested that the Iranian president should be restricted to the immediate vicinity of the United Nations and should not be permitted to travel the full extent of the 25 - mile radius that is normally allowed for foreign dignitaries .
The national director of the Anti-Defamation League , Abraham Foxman , suggested that the NYPD had been right to engage with the Iranian mission under their legal obligations to provide protection for dignitaries , but praised them for opposing the plan .
" I am glad they gave it thought .
I 'm glad that they examined the legal , pragmatic , and the moral issues , " he said .
" Having said that , his visa to come to this country is not for sightseeing purposes .
It 's limited to the purpose of his business at the United Nations .
The 25 - mile radius is to permit egress and exit , " he said .
" Of course , we want to educate anybody and everybody about the threat of terrorism and the effects of terror , and 9/11 , " the American ambassador to the U.N. , Zalmay Khalilzad , said .
He added however : " We do n't want that site , where so many people from around the world lost their lives , to be used as a photo - op by people who are involved in terror . "
Others were also quick to condemn the idea yesterday .
A prominent Iranian scholar who is founder of the American Iranian Council , Hooshang Amirahmadi , said the plan illustrated Mr. Ahmadinejad 's naiveté and misunderstanding of the American people .
He said the Iranian president may have thought the visit would improve his image with the American people and the Bush administration , which has lately been more aggressive in its criticism of Iran and its nuclear program .
" He does n't understand how America works .
He does n't understand the depths of the problems with the U.S. , " Mr. Amirahmadi said .
" Somebody may have told him that ground zero is very symbolic to Americans , and that visiting there and saying something would help  the problem is that everybody around him is stupid . "
The proposed visit also angered families of the victims of September 11 and local officials , including the City Council speaker , Christine Quinn , who said she had already been planning to attend a protest against the Iranian leader .
Mr. Ahmadinejad " is not welcome in our community , where we have seen the results , the ultimate results , of what happens when one disrespects the value of human life , " a council member who represents Lower Manhattan , Alan Gerson , said .
Council Member Eric Gioia said he would be organizing a protest at ground zero with victims ' families in the event that Mr. Ahmadinejad does visit .
" It 's an outrage , " Mr. Gioia said .
" The city of New York should not be giving a photo op to a tyrant . "
Debra Burlingame  whose brother was killed when the hijacked airplane he was piloting crashed into the Pentagon on the morning of September 11 , 2001  said the visit would be " morally offensive . "
She said allowing the request would play right into Mr. Ahmadinejad 's hand .
" I think this would be a photo op for Ahmadinejad that would be published all over the radical Islamic world as him visiting the site of their greatest victory , " she said .
Star Tribune , Elmer L. Andersen ( Ex- Governor MN ) —
Throughout my tenure and beyond as the 30th governor of this state , I have been steadfastly aligned — and until recently , proudly so — with the Minnesota Republican Party . …
The present Republican president has led us into an unjustified war — based on misguided and blatantly false misrepresentations of the threat of weapons of mass destruction .
The terror seat was Afghanistan .
Iraq had no connection to these acts of terror and was not a serious threat to the United States , as this president claimed , and there was no relation , it ’s now obvious , to any serious weaponry .
Although Saddam Hussein is a frightful tyrant , he posed no threat to the United States when we entered the war .
George W. Bush ’s arrogant actions to jump into Iraq when he had no plan how to get out have alienated the United States from our most trusted allies and weakened us immeasurably around the world .

Wo n't somebody , please , think of the children ?
Three weeks ago , I received my favourite email of all time , from a science teacher .
" I 've just had to ask a BBC Panorama film crew not to film in my class because of the bad science they were trying to carry out , " it began , describing in detail the Panorama which aired this week .
This show was on suppressed dangers of radiation from Wi -Fi networks , and how they harm children .
There was no science in it , just some " experiments " they did for themselves , and some conflicting experts .
Panorama disagreed with the WHO expert , so he was smeared for not being " independent " enough , and working for a phone company in the past .
I do n't do smear .
But Panorama started it .
How independent were the " experiments " they did ?
They had 28 minutes , I have about 550 words .
In the show , you can see them walking around Norwich with a " radiation monitor " .
Radiation , incidentally , is a word used 30 times in half an hour , although Wi-Fi is " radiation " in the same sense light is .
" Ooh , it 's well into the red there , " says reporter Paul Kenyon , holding a detector .
Well into the red on what ?
It 's tricky to calibrate measurements , and to decide what to measure , and what the cut - off point is for " red " .
Panorama 's readings were " well into the red " on " the COM monitor " , a piece of detecting equipment designed by Alasdair Philips of Powerwatch , the man who leads the campaign against Wi-Fi .
His device is manufactured for Powerwatch , and he will sell one to you for just £ 175 .
So not very independent , then .
Panorama did not disclose where this detector came from .
And they know Alasdair Philips is no ordinary " engineer doing the readings " , because they told us in the show , but did n't tell the school .
" They wanted to take measurements in my classroom , compare them to radiation from a phone mast and film kids using wireless laptops .
They introduced ' the engineer here to do the readings ' . "
The teacher found it was the same man who runs Powerwatch , the pressure group campaigning against mobile phones , Wi-Fi , and " electrosmog " .
In Alasdair 's Powerwatch shop you can buy shielded netting for your windows at £ 70.50 per metre , and special shielding paint at £ 50.99 per litre .
When the children saw Alasdair 's Powerwatch website , they were outraged .
Panorama were calmly expelled from the school .
So what about Panorama 's classroom experiment ?
Not very independent , not very well designed .
Panorama planned to have the man from Powerwatch talk for about 10 minutes about how Wi -Fi worked , and what effects it had on the human body .
Then they were going to reveal the readings he got from the mast , compare them to what Powerwatch measured in the classroom , and film the kids ' reaction .
So not very independent then .
There should be more research into Wi-Fi .
If Panorama had made a show about the scientific evidence , we would be discussing that .
Instead , they produced scares , and smears about whether people are " independent " .
The BBC said : " Alasdair Phillips is one of a handful of people with the right equipment to do this test .
He was only used in this capacity and was not given the opportunity to interpret the readings let alone campaign on them in the film . "

Finally .
Yeah , it got delayed , not because of any huge issues , but because of
various bugfixes trickling in and causing me to reset my " release clock "
all the time .
But it 's out there now , and hopefully better for the wait .
Not a whole lot of changes since - rc9 , although there 's a few updates to
mips , sparc64 and blackfin in there .
Ignoring those arch updates , there 's
basically a number of mostly one - liners ( mostly in drivers , but there 's
some networking fixes and soem VFS / VM fixes there too ) .
Shortlog and diffstat appended ( both relative to - rc9 , of course - the
full log from 2.6.22 is on kernel.org as usual ) .
I want this to be what people look at for a few days , but expect the x86
merge to go ahead after that .
So far , all indications are still that it's
going to be all smooth sailing , but hey , those indicators seem to always
say that , and only after the fact do people notice any problems ;)

The head of China 's environmental agency has blamed the rising number of riots , demonstrations and petitions across the country on public anger at pollution .
Echoing the language of the Cultural Revolution , Zhou Shengxian called for a " struggle " against polluters , and said the public refused to accept the increasing degradation of the environment .
His unusually outspoken comments underscore the frustration of state mandarins at local government officials who ignore environmental standards in order to attract investment , jobs and bribes .
Breakneck growth has turned China into a huge environmental disaster area .
A soon - to - be- published World Bank report says some 500,000 people die each year as a result of pollution .
Beijing is trying to shift the economy on to a more sustainable development track .
The state council - China 's cabinet - tightened the water pollution law to require more testing , licensing and stiffer penalties , the state - run Xinhua news agency reported yesterday .
But factory owners who violate state guidelines are often protected by local officials .
According to Mr Zhou , the state environmental protection administration chief , many plants build secret pipes to discharge polluting chemicals .
Others release toxins when locals are asleep .
The China Daily quoted him as saying : " Some businesses do n't rest deep in the night when they have no scruples about dumping pollution in rivers . "
In a recent inspection of 529 firms along the Yellow , Yangtze and other major rivers and lakes , 44 % had violated environmental laws , while almost half of the 75 waste water treatment facilities underperformed or did not work .
Mr Zhou said some waterways resembled " sticky glue " .
The absence of protection has stirred up discontent , he said , and prompted a growing number of " mass incidents " , the term used to describe protests .
He said petitions received by his agency this year were up 8 % .
While not endorsing protests , Mr Zhou called for local environmental officials to stand up to violators .
Demonstrations against power and chemical plants have become increasingly common in recent years .
In May , thousands took to the streets of Xiamen , in Fujian province , leading to the suspension of a petrochemical plant .
In 2005 , police killed at least three villagers in Dongzhou , Guangdong province , while quelling a riot over a planned power plant .
Anger has been fuelled by unfair land grabs and health fears .
According to the government , two - thirds of China 's 595 cities now have unhealthy air .
Pollution scandals are common .
Earlier yesterday , state media reported that tap water had been restored to 200,000 residents of Shuyang county in Jiangsu after a chemical spill halted supplies for 40 hours .
The environment agency said more than a quarter of the seven main river systems were so polluted that the water was unfit for human contact .
The tendency towards secrecy has increased concerns .
According to the FT , officials have tried to remove figures from a World Bank report that suggest up to 400,000 people in China die each year from outdoor air pollution , 30,000 from indoor air pollution , and 60,000 from water pollution .
The government denies it has tried to interfere .
1982 : Dingo baby trial opens in Australia
A mother who says her nine - week - old daughter was killed by a dingo has appeared in court in Australia charged with her murder .
Lindy Chamberlain , who is seven months pregnant , is accused of slitting Azaria 's throat as she sat in the front seat of the family car at a campsite at Ayers Rock .
The mystery of Azaria 's disappearance two years ago attracted widespread publicity .
Her body has never been found .
The original inquest into the baby 's death found she had been killed by a dingo , but new forensic evidence led to a second inquest which suggested the child 's throat had been cut and Mrs Chamberlain was sent for trial .
Not guilty
Her husband Michael , a Seventh Day Adventist minister , is also on trial , accused of trying to cover up the truth .
Mr and Mrs Chamberlain have both pleaded not guilty .
The courtroom was packed for the first day of what has already been dubbed by one newspaper as Australia 's " trial of the century " .
Prosecutor Ian Barker told the court Mrs Chamberlain 's story that her baby had been taken from the couple 's tent by a dingo was a " fanciful lie to conceal the truth " .
Neither of the accused showed any emotion as the bloodstained jumpsuit worn by Azaria at the time of her disappearance was exhibited to the courtroom .
Mr Barker told the court extensive tests by a team in London would convince the jury the baby 's throat had been cut , not savaged by a dingo .
He said traces of blood had also been found in the family car more than a year after Azaria disappeared .
Tests showed attempts had been made to wipe away the blood .
Further investigations revealed the blood came from a child less than six months old , suggesting it was Azaria's .
He continued the tiny amount of blood found in the Chamberlains ' tent was inconsistent with a dingo attack .
Nor were there any traces of saliva found on the baby 's clothing which would have supported the claim .
The child 's clothing was found close to a dingo's lair , seven days after her disappearance .
The prosecution claimed it had been planted there after the child 's body had been buried .
Mr Barker said he would not suggest a motive for the killing , nor would he suggest Mr Chamberlain had been involved - but he probably learned about it soon afterwards and helped conceal the truth .
The trial is scheduled to last more than six weeks and should end just before Mrs Chamberlain is due to give birth , early in November .
EGv8 was originally conceived when Nizzity asked EG how many 8 year old kids it would take to bring him down .
EG responded that no amount would be enough because he would eat them as he went and would slowly grow in power .
He claims that eventually his heartburn would allow him to breath fire and they would fall before him .
The game will test the merit of his claims .
This is an accurate scientific simulation .

Before the hurricane arrived , some Jamaicans were evacuated from low - lying areas into special shelters .
However , very few people are reported to have moved to local schools where shelters had been set up .

What are these ?
If you were to make a list of the top five scientists who ever lived , who would you choose ?
People are asking the question ( also , here , here ) .
So far , it has n't been all that interesting .
All the lists have two or three names in common , and throw in two or three unexpected names for balance .
Physics is highly overrepresented , either because people are easily impressed , or because they 've watched Cosmos one too many times .
Do n't get me wrong , I like physics as much as anybody .
But once your list includes Newton , Einstein , and Maxwell , and then you throw in Galileo , well there 's not much room for anything else .
None at all if you take Darwin as a given .
So I decided to do something a little different :
What five scientists have had the greatest impact on human life ?
Yes , Newton was great , but gravity goes on without him .
Many later discoveries stood on his shoulders , but Newton 's achievements were far more intellectual than practical .
I 'm looking for people whose accomplishments saved lives , prevented wars , stopped hunger , or released people from endless drudgery .
This is n't a list of inventors -- if it were , there would be a lot of ancient inventions like the moldboard plow that deserve more attention than anything modern .
It 's a list of scientists whose impact stretched across many fields , and without whom life today would likely be worse .
1. R. A. Fisher .
His work in population genetics laid the foundations for the vast productivity increases of twentieth - century agriculture .
He was far from alone in this , but he stood apart from his contemporaries by inventing many of the statistical methods that would come to define scientific hypothesis testing .
Without Fisher 's innovations in statistics , large - scale medical research studies would be meaningless .
All this after he established the basis for Mendelian inheritance of continuous characters .
2. Louis Pasteur .
Everyone knows that he kept milk from souring .
His work established the germ theory , with immense effects on human medicine , food ( and beer ) production , and the care of crops and domesticated animals .
Less well known is his early research on crystallography , which discovered the chirality of organic molecules and made use of methods that would later be essential to determine the structure of DNA .
And , oh yeah , he developed the first man-made vaccines , curing the otherwise incurable rabies .
3. Leo Szilárd .
How good can a physicist be and still be virtually unknown ?
Szilárd may set the bar .
In his early career , he set out the mathematical connection between physical entropy and information , and was the first to conceive and ( with Fermi ) carry out a nuclear chain reaction .
Most of the important physicists of his day were involved in the Manhattan Project , but Szilárd initiated it , drafting the famous letter from Einstein to Roosevelt .
He organized pre-war efforts to keep atomic research secret , and founded post - war efforts to promote arms control .
Then , he became a biologist : discovering that UV light kills bacteria , and inventing the chemostat .
He made the atomic bomb and nuclear power possible , did everything possible to keep them from the Axis , and laid the groundwork for molecular biology .
All this from a man who set out with his partner to invent a refrigerator with no moving parts .
The partner : Albert Einstein .
4. John von Neumann .
The indispensable mathematician , he did more than anyone else to create the postwar world .
His developments in game theory shaped the Cold War , his work in formal logic led to Gödel 's famous incompleteness theorem , and his early work with computers paved the way to the information revolution .
He brought computers into the Manhattan Project , helped develop the hydrogen bomb , and developed new simulation methods essential to building efficient jet and rocket engines , and ultimately modeling all kinds of scientific problems .
5 . This one is for you .
Who else belongs on this list ?
You 've probably seen infomercials for the Video Professor on late - night TV ; a kindly - looking John Scherer has been pitching his company 's computer training videos for two decades now .
But Video Professor , Inc. has no problem using less - friendly tactics when confronted with criticism , and the company is now suing more than 100 anonymous Internet posters over derogatory comments that they made about Video Professor 's business .
The Denver Post noticed the case a few days back , and it 's certainly an odd one .
Video Professor filed a federal claim in a Colorado court against 100 " John and Jane Does " who committed " unauthorized Internet disparagement of VPI and its products " on web sites such as infomercialscams.com ( the site , incidentally , is the number three Google result for " video professor " ) .
The complaints generally follow a similar theme : Video Professor allegedly markets products as free to try , then pitches callers with upsells that confuse them into signing up for subscriptions .
A recent comment from " Tina " is typical .
" I had purchased one piece of software from Video Professor ... before I knew what was happening , my credit card was overdrawn and more attempted charges were constantly occurring .
I kept calling customer service , returned the original software and heard many promises of the 100 percent refund , less S/H .
This has been over 3 years now . "
Oddly enough , the Video Professor contacted the owner of the site back in July and told him that they wanted the full contact information for all concerned parties in order to address them individually and continue " providing superior customer service . "
Now , two months later , the company has sued the anonymous individuals in question and is trying to enforce a subpoena against infomercialscams.com in order to get IP addresses about posters .
Those posters are being charged with commercial disparagement , false advertising , misrepresentation , and posting false and defamatory messages .
That 's certainly the sort of superior customer service we 'd all like more of .
Unfortunately for Video Professor , it can't sue the site operators directly ( although it would really , really like to ) .
The Communications Decency
Act gives such sites a " safe harbor " against prosecution based on user posts , so Video Professor is forced instead to individually pursue each person that made a disparaging remark .
The company 's federal complaint is a strange read , since it does not identify even a single false and defamatory statement ; it simply asserts the existence of such statements somewhere on Teh Interwebs .
Despite that , the company was able to obtain a subpoena to obtain the information it is seeking .
Infomercialscams.com is being represented by the Public Citizen Litigation Group in Washington , DC .
Paul Levy , one of the group 's lawyers , late last week sent a strongly - worded letter ( PDF ) to Video Professor that outlined the perceived problems with the subpoena .
Chief among them is the fact that anonymous , critical speech is generally protected by the First Amendment , and the threshold for unveiling anonymous posters is high .
Despite that , Levy notes that the good doctor 's lawyers can't simply assert that 100 unknown individuals posted false and defamatory messages .
For one thing , the particular messages in question need to be identified ( the complaint does not even indicate which posts it refers to ) .
Within those posts , actual false claims need to be mentioned ( none are ) .
Further , it 's unlikely that each alleged offender is exactly guilty of the same transgression , so the company needs to offer evidence for each particular case .
Due to the extreme generality of the complaint and subpoena , Levy asks , " Is it Video Professor 's position that any former customer who criticizes its conduct must necessarily be making false statements , and hence is subject to sued for libel ?
Certainly you have given no evidentiary reason to believe that any of the statements about Video Professor are false . "
The company is no stranger to the courtroom .
A search shows that Video Professor has filed four separate federal lawsuits in 2007 alone .
In one of these Video Professor sued a rival seller of computer training products who included a link on his site to other sites critical of Professor practices .
In the last three years , the company has racked up 615 Better Business Bureau complaints , though all appear to have been quickly addressed .
The company is certainly serious about the newest case .
Founder John Scherer told the Denver Post , " I personally do not believe that you can be anonymous and bash people and get away with it under the First Amendment .
I will stay with this case , and I will get the names that I am requesting .
I will pursue this until the Supreme Court tells me I can't get them . "
Fortunately , federal courts rule based on US law and not the personal beliefs of the litigants .
フィッシング対策ソフトの導入動向
最近、金融機関 が 「 PhishWall 」 や「 PhishCut」を導入したというニュースをよく見かけるなあと思っていたら、どうやら、金融庁の監督指針の今年の改定でフィッシング対策について明記されたことが関係しているらしい。
主要行等向けの総合的な監督指針（平成19年6月版） , 中小・地域金融機関向けの総合的な監督指針（平成19年8月版） , 金融庁 III - 3 - 7 インターネットバンキング III - 3 - 7 - 2 主な着眼点 ( 2 ) セキュリティの確保 ホームページのリンクに関し、利用者が取引相手を誤認するような構成になっていないか。また、フィッシング詐欺対策については、利用者がアクセスしているサイトが真正なサイトであることの証明を確認できるような措置を講じる等、業務に応じた適切な不正防止策を講じているか。
「 ホームページのリンクに関し」という表現のあたり、なんだか書いた人もよくわかっていないようで一抹の不安を覚えるが、これの意味するところは、必ずしも対策ソフトを導入せよという意味ではないだろう。ログイン画面で他社のドメイン名を使用していたりしないかとか、ログイン画面でドメイン名を確認できないようにしていたりしないかとか、そういうことだろう。つまり、わかりやすい自社のドメイン名を使って、普通に画面設計して、適切なサーバ証明書を使用していれば、この要件を満たすということだ。
しかし、どういう事情があるのか理解しかねるのだが、そうした基本が実施できない中小銀行があるようで、そういうところが対策ソフトを続々導入しているようだ。

第四銀行だけが例外で、本来なすべきことを実施している。金を払って物を買うだけなら〓〓でもできるだろうが、アドレスバーを直したり、右クリックを直すということは、なぜかできないらしい。
ちなみに 、「 nProtect : Netizen」が16もの銀行に導入されているようだが、これは、金融庁の言う「利用者がアクセスしているサイトが真正なサイトであることの証明を確認できるような措置」には当たらないだろう。なぜなら、まず本物サイトへ行ってボタンを押さないと「nProtect:Netizen」が起動しないからだ。
ちなみに 、「 nProtect : Netizen」を導入している銀行における、「真正なサイトであることを確認できるような措置」の対応状況を調べてみると、表2のように、認識の低いところばかりだということがわかる。

この差はどこからくるのか、だ。これらの地銀とて、自社でシステム運用をしているわけではなく、IBMかどこかのASPサービスを利用しているようだ（ASPサービスのホストをDNSで自社ドメイン上に割り当てていると思われる）から、巨額の修正費用が必要とかいった事情があるとは思えない。
それに対し 、PhishWallの導入費用は、10万アカウントまでで年額240万円だそうで、常陽銀行の場合導入事例紹介パンフレットによると5万ユーザだそうだから、一人当たり年に50円負担している（私も負担している）ことになる。EV
SSL証明書が年額 7万5千円から20万円ほどだから、その10倍から30倍もの値段だ。
緑シグナルが点灯しないケース
ところで、沖縄銀行のトップページには「フィッシング対策ツールPhishWallインストールのお願い」というリンクが目立つように置かれているのだが、そこには図1のように説明されている。
「 緑色のシグナルが表示されれば安全！」というのだが、左のメニューにある「eバンキング」のところをクリックして、「ログイン」ボタンを押すと、図2の画面となる。
PhishWallの緑シグナルが点灯しない。
メニューの「eパートナー」の方ではPhishWallの緑シグナルが点灯するので、新システムのログイン画面だけPhishWall対応にして、旧システム（「平成18年6月以前にご契約のお客様」と書かれている）のログイン画面には対応していないのだろう。
不思議なのは、 「 フィッシング対策ツー ル PhishWallインストールのお願い」のページで、「eバンキング」の方には対応していないという注意書きがないことだ。ユーザから「緑シグナルが点灯しません！」という問い合わせは殺到していないのだろうか？
もしかして、実はユーザは誰も、パスワード入力時にPhishWallシグナルを気に留めていないのではないか？
もっとひどいのは、（銀行ではないが）オリコでのPhishWall導入事例だ。トップページの「eオリコサービス
ログイン」のボタンを押すと図3のようになる。
PhishWallのシグナルがログイン画面で確認できない。
セキュアブレイン （PhishWall販売元）のオリコについての説明ページによると、オリコ内でも対応しているページと対応していないページがあるそうで、図4のように説明されている。
ユーザにこれを覚えていろというのだろうか。いったいどういうユーザ層向けのシステムなのか。
フィッシング回避補助ツール「 petname tool 」
ちなみに、私が最近気に入っているフィッシング対策ツールは「petname tool」だ。Firefox用の機能拡張で、次のようにして使える。
まずログイン画面に行き、 「 安全な Webサイト利用の鉄則」で言うところの 、 「 ( A ) 初めて訪れたサイトの場合」の手順で、サイトが自分の意図しているところに間違いないことを慎重に（サーバ証明書等で）確認し、確認できたら、サイトに自分で名前を付ける。最初に訪れたときは、図5のようにpetname toolの領域は黄色 で「untrusted 」と表示されている。
ここは入力欄になっているので、「untrusted」を消して、自分で決めた名前を入力し（図6）、エンターキーで決定する。
エンターキーで決定すると緑色になり、その名前でブックマークされる。（Firefoxの「 Bookmark Toolbar Folder」の中の「 petname」フォルダの中にブックマークが作成される。）
その後、どこかから（例えばメールから誘導されて）このログイン画面に到着すると、図7のように、ここが緑色になり、過去に自分が付けたブックマーク名が表示される。作者はこれを「bidirectional bookmark（双方向ブックマーク）」と呼んでいて、ブックマーク済みのサイトに到着するとブックマーク名が表示されるというわけだ。
論文に書かれているように、同じサイトであることの判別はSSLのサーバ証明書の内容で行われているため、direct.smbc.co.jp の https:// ページで登録した名前が www.smbc.co.jp の https:// ページ上でも有効となるようだ。
When the user creates a new petname , the petname tool creates a new bookmark to the current page .
The " Name " field of the bookmark is the user chosen petname .
The " Description " field of the bookmark contains the hash of the CAs public key and the subject 's O , L , ST and C certificate fields .
If the subject has no O ( Organization ) field , the CN ( domain name ) field is used instead .
On each page transition , the petname tool looks at the certificate chain of the SSL connection that delivered the page and searches for a corresponding bookmark .
If one is found , the petname field is populated with the bookmark 's " Name " .
Otherwise , the petname field is populated with the string " untrusted " .
The petname tool uses the CA ( Certificate Authority ) and subject DN ( Distinguished Name ) as the secure identifier for a relationship because many secure sites use multiple domain names and multiple public keys .
Further , it is important that sites be able to replace key pairs without breaking their user 's petnames .
Tyler Close , Petname Tool : Enabling web site recognition using the existing SSL infrastructure , W3C Workshop on Transparency and Usability of Web Authentication , March 2006
ユーザは、パスワード入力の直前にここが緑色になっていることを確認すればよい。これだけだ。紛らわしいドメイン名によるフィッシングが横行していても、（二度目以降については）すばやく本物サイトであることを確認することができる。
これは、 「 安全な Webサイト利用の鉄則 」で言うところの、「今見ている画面が過去に訪れたサイトかどうか機械的に見分ける方法」の機能を果たしていると言える。Internet Explorerの信頼済みサイトゾーンを使う方法は、セキュリティレベルと同時に管理する必要があるので、いまひとつであったが、petname toolのように専用になっていると使いやすい。 。
自分で登録するか勝手に登録されたものを見るか
この点について 、PhishWallの導入事例紹介パンフレットにこんな記述がある。
巧妙に偽装されたフィッシングを簡単に防止できるようにしたい
フィッシングを防ぐのは簡単ではない。それは、利用者が自分で意識して、ひっかからないようにしなくてはならないからだ。サイトごとに信頼済サイトとしてIPアドレスを登録しておくのは、利用者にとってわずらわしい作業だ。また、目的のWebサイトにアクセスするたびに、開いたページのURLを確認する手法では、正しいWebサイトかを見分けるのは非常に困難だ。「フィッシング対策は利用者に依存する場合が多いのですが、PhishWallのクライアント用ソフトは無料で、利用者が一度インストールするだけで他に手間はかかりません。そこが一番大きいところだと思います。インターネット上のどのWebサイトに行っても、ブラウザ上に緑のシグナルが出ているかぎり、お客様は騙される心配がありません」（関氏）。
PhishWallサーバ 導入事例 , セキュアブレイ ン
「 IPアドレスを登録」？というのはげせないが、それはともかく、サイトごとに登録するのが煩わしいというが、その単純なことさえできないユーザに、はたしてPhishWallの緑シグナルの確認ができるかどうか疑問だ。なにしろ、正規サイトであっても緑にならない画面もあるわけだから、どこで出るはずなのかは自分で把握しておかざるを得ない。常陽銀行のケースでも、インターネットバンキング以外のページではPhishWall非対応になっている ため、例えば、資料請求のページでは本物サイトであっても緑シグナルにならないことを知っておかなければならない。
2005 年12月24日の日記「 Phishing対策ツールバーなんていらない！ 元々あるIEの機能を使う」では、次のように書いていた。
「 PhishWallデモページ」に書かれている説明によると、
PhishWallツールバーをブラウザにインストールしておくと、PhishWall対応サーバに初めて接続したとき、ツールバーに黄色の「●●●」マークが表示され、「このWebサイトと信頼関係を結ぶためには登録作業を行ってください」というダイアログウィンドウが現れる。ここで「登録する」ボタンを押すと、次回以降も含めて、そのサイトに訪れると「●●●」マークが緑色で表示されるという。
当初の設計ではユーザの意思で登録する方式だったのが、現在は最初から緑シグナルという仕様に変更されていたようだ。
まあ、ぶっちゃけ言っちゃうと、EV SSL と同様の仕組みだ。サイト運営者を一定の基準で審査することによって緑シグナルを表示するか否かを決定するもの。PhishWallは何やら独自の技術的認証方式を用いているようだが、SSLのサーバ証明書情報を使って同じことはできるのになぜわざわざ独自方式を使うのか当初から理解しかねた。その方式自体にはおそらく意味がないだろう。ブラウザやWebサイトに脆弱性がある場合に影響を受けないとかいった利点が存在する可能性はあるが、仕様が公開されていないので評価できない。
いくら かPhishWallの勝る点はある。EV
SSL では、証明書の内容の表示が現状では英文でしか表示されないのに対し、PhishWallでは日本語で組織名が表示される。これは、EV
SSL対応のブラウザがなんとか日本語表示に対応してほしいところ。
また 、PhishWall はWindows 98にも対応していることを売りにしている。導入事例紹介パンフレットでも常用銀行が「
Windows 98のお客様もいらっしゃるので、そういう方々を置き去りにするのも当行の理念に反しますし」と言っているのだが、そもそもサポート中止となって脆弱性修正パッチも出ていないWindows
98は安全に使えないわけで、本来ならば、銀行としては、顧客の安全確保のために、「当行のインターネットバンキングをお使いの際には
Windows 98を使用しないでください。安全にお使いになることができません。」とアドバイスするべき立場にあるはずで、常陽銀行は本当に客のことを想ってくれているのか疑わしく感じる（一人の預金者として）。
それから、審査基準の違いを見ておくとよいかもしれない。PhishWallの審査基準では、 「
「その他会社」については、各種主要任意団体に加盟していることが必要」といったことが書かれている。EV
SSLの審査基準については、日本電子認証協議会の公開資料で閲覧できる。
まあ、標準化を目指していないような閉鎖的独自方式があんまり広く普及しちゃうのはどうかと思う。少なくとも技術者ならそういうセンスを持ち合わせているのではないか。金融庁殿には、そのあたりを把握して、踏み外した監督指針になってしまわないように配慮願いたい。
一方的に提供されたものが理解されるか

I am writing about my absolute disgust with Comcast and what they did to me tonight .
It is 2:30 AM PDT .
Yesterday was my Son ’s 4th birthday .
An hour ago he had a seizer .
He was taken by ambulance to the hospital with his mom , my wife .
I am at home right now going out of my mind with worry .
I have another son who is sleeping , so one of us had to stay here while the other went .
I am not sure where to start because I am really pissed off .
I picked up my telephone and called 911 .
All I got was a buzzing sound on the other end .
I hung up and called 911 again , another weird noise .
Frustrated , I start hunting for my cell phone .
After finding it , I call 911 and spend the next 5 minutes ( which felt more like 22 hours ) trying to the dispatcher what our address was .
After my son went to the hospital , I am left alone infuriated at Comcast .
This E911 thing they have is supposed to get my 911 call through .
By law I thought .
I pick up the same phone I used to call 911 and call Comcast support .
Seems to work fine to call support .
Over the next hour I am shunted from call center to call center to supervisor to supervisor .
I want someone ’s head .
I want to wake up a VP , CTO , or even the CEO and let them know that their service delayed my son from getting the medical treatment he needed .
That they need to know that the poor service they provided can put a life at risk .
That this system needs to work .
It has to work .
They need to know , and some supervisor is not going to be the one to champion that message .
I want a friggin VP to be woken up .
I want heads to roll .
After an hour , I get to a supervisor in Texas who tells me escalating beyond her is “ outside of her procedure ” and refuses to escalate .
She has an attitude , of course , and no doubt I am getting more upset by the minute .
This call was not roses and butterflies .
After prodding her for 10 minutes to escalate the call , she tells me the management “ has a right to sleep ” as the reason for her not to escalate .
Infuriated , I tell her “ fuck you ” .
She proceeds to hang up on me , but not before saying “ Have a good day sir ” .
I know this blog looks new , that ’s because it is .
I have an email I registered at gmail tonight for this .
It ’s itcanhappentoyou@gmail.com .
I can explain more of what happened if anyone wants to email me .
This is n’t some BS , pissed off Comcast customer who could n’t get online at 2:00 in the morning .
Comcast needs to be held responsible when their service fails .
They need to have escalation procedures that gets the customer to the person that can champion change , or at least advocate for customers .
I told the supervisor that unless this call gets escalated , I am going to go to every website I know and post this experience .
It ’s the only medium I have to express my frustration and the only way , it seems , that a consumer can be heard .
If a service failure results in something like this , someone should be woken up and held accountable .
The service should have never failed .
I should be able to pick up my phone and call 911 and get through .
Please digg this , link to it , do what you need to do so Comcast gets the message .

Without quite knowing why , I started Googling some odd queries and eventually found something that led me to being accused of being a spammer .
Of course , while I ’m not a spammer , I have eaten Spam and think that it ’s a staple of Hawaiian culture .
As for the query …
Performing the following search will yield you an error screen in Google :
http://www.google.com/search?q=0000000..0000000
Though I ’m not nearly intelligent enough to figure out why Google would give an error when searching for the number 0000000 followed by two decimals ( or periods you English freaks ) and then repeating the number 0000000 it does still happen .
Before you comment on something like “ I used a different number or series of numbers ” , I do n’t care .
Really , I do n’t .
I know it works with different numbers , so do n’t tell me about your new theory using the number one or two or different numbers .
The basic concept is that you type in some repeated number or series of numbers at least 7 spaces long and separate those numbers with two decimal points and BAM !
Of course when you mess with Google ’s search too many times , it gives the CAPTCHA window .
Since I ’m not a spammer ( I ’m a blogger , drinker , and professional weasel massager ) I have never seen or used Google in a spamming way , but Google is really being careful because after I searched the same query 8 times ( within a minute period of time ) I got a spammer - not - fool - proof screen :
So my question for you Google - knowledgable , what ’s the deal with this ?
I do n’t mean the CAPTCHA page , I mean the numeral , dot , dot , numeral search result .
Oh ya , when you enter the characters seen in the box , you get a Google redirect page :

Smokers will be asked not to smoke in their own homes to protect council staff .
Health and safety officers at Liverpool City Council have drawn up plans asking residents not to smoke at least half an hour before council staff visit .
The plans also ask council house residents to open windows and not light up during a home visit to protect their employees from exposure to smoke .
The city council insist the new rules are not a " ban " and they will not be able to force householders to comply .
But if residents insist on smoking at home during a visit from a council employee the visit will be ended and they will be asked to attend a council office - which comes under the UK - wide no smoking ban from July 1 .
The new rules will apply to all residents in council houses and private homes and to all staff visiting homes , including social workers , enforcement officers and planning officers .
A council committee will meet this week to discuss the proposals drawn up in a report by the Town Hall 's Health and Safety Unit .
The report says : " In circumstances where staff are undertaking prearranged visits , service users will be requested to refrain from smoking in their own homes prior to and during the visit . "
Risk assessment exercises will be carried out in cases where exposure to tobacco smoke cannot be prevented .
A spokesman for Liverpool City Council said : " We are not banning people from smoking in their own homes .
" All we are asking , and it is a reasonable request , is that people respect the views and the health of visiting council staff and ask them not to smoke while council staff are visiting in their own home .
" This is a reasonable way in which to deal with this .
" It is a request to residents and we , as an employer , have a legal duty to protect the interests and health of our staff and I am one million per cent confident the people of this city will respond in a positive manner to that .
" I do n't think ban or instruction is necessary because it is common sense and people will support it . "
The new rules come as one council defended its decision to investigate " odour nuisance " caused by a couple smoking in their own home .
Jeanette and Gavin Gordon - Crawley received a letter from their local council telling them officials were to probe their smoking habits following a complaint from a neighbour .
The couple , from Caernarfon , North Wales , received a letter from Gwynedd County Council saying a neighbour had complained about cigarette smoke " permeating into her living room " from the couple 's semi-detached home .
Mr Gordon - Crawley , 51 , who smokes 20 cigarettes a day , said he thought it was a joke at first and defended his right to smoke in his own home .
A spokeswoman for Gwynedd County Council said : " What people do within their own homes is of no concern to us , as long as they do not affect other people .
" In this instance we have received a complaint stating that smoking in a house in the Caernarfon area is causing a nuisance to the neighbours and as a local authority we have a statutory responsibility to investigate this complaint .
" Officers from the Council 's Public Protection Service are investigating . "

The Social Security Administration says a federal judge ’s ruling last week suspending a crackdown on employers who hire illegal immigrants could cause a major disruption in its processing of millions of routine retirement and disability claims .
In papers filed late Wednesday in federal court in San Francisco , David A. Rust , an acting Social Security deputy commissioner , said a vast bureaucratic logjam would result unless the agency was allowed this month to mail about 141,000 already - prepared letters advising employers of discrepancies between workers ’
Social Security information and agency records .
Government lawyers said any delay in the mailing — or any requirement that the mailing be revised — would cause “ significant harm ” to the agency and “ interfere with its ability to carry out its core functions . ”
The plea came after the judge , Maxine M. Chesney of federal court in San Francisco , issued a ruling Friday temporarily barring the Social Security agency from sending the mailings , known as “ no - match ” letters .
The latest letters , which refer to the records of more than eight million workers , include a Department of Homeland Security notice advising employers about new rules to follow after receiving them .
If the workers in question cannot show within 90 days that they have valid Social Security numbers , employers must fire them or risk prosecution .
In her ruling , Judge Chesney temporarily halted the new rules from taking effect and set a hearing for Oct.
1 . The government asked in its new filing that the hearing be moved up to Sept. 19 .
On Thursday the plaintiffs opposed the change , and the judge denied the government ’s request .

BBC News , Milan
Some 80 hares are thought to be causing the disruption
Hare chase
The animals invaded the runways at Milan 's Linate Airport - and affected the operation of vital equipment .
Airport bosses are baffled as to why the hare population at Linate has risen so dramatically in the past few months .
Whatever the cause , the result has been chaos - in the past two weeks alone , two hares have ended up beneath the wheels of charter planes .
Unusual step
Hares have plagued Milan 's Linate Airport for months
Enlarge Image
They have also confused the ground radar that is meant to prevent a repeat of Italy 's worst ever air crash , which left 118 people dead , at Linate in 2001 .
Things have become so serious that officials have taken the unusual step of closing Linate for three hours - from first light on Sunday - while a team of local wildlife experts try to catch the 80 or so hares that have been causing the problem .
The hares will be taken to nature reserves around Milan - though officials have warned that they have not ruled out a cull if this fails .
Linate is the airport of choice for anyone wanting a quick trip into Milan - lying as it does just five kilometres ( three miles ) from the city centre - unlike the city 's other airports which can often take more than an hour to reach on the area 's congested motorways .
Hares are not the only natural hazard to afflict Linate : it 's also prone to bouts of dense fog .
The brain cranks out memories near its center , in a looped wishbone of tissue called the hippocampus .
But a new study suggests only a small chunk of it , called the dentate gyrus , is responsible for “ episodic ” memories — information that allows us to tell similar places and situations apart .
The finding helps explain where déjà vu originates in the brain , and why it happens more frequently with increasing age and with brain - disease patients , said MIT neuroscientist Susumu Tonegawa .
The study is detailed today in the online version of the journal Science .
{{adsense|premier|left}}
Like a computer logging its programs ’ activities , the dentate gyrus notes a situation ’s pattern — its visual , audio , smell , time and other cues for the body ’s future reference .
So what happens when its abilities are jammed ?
When Tonegawa and his team bred mice without a fully - functional dentate gyrus , the rodents struggled to tell the difference between two similar but different situations .
“ These animals normally have a distinct ability to distinguish between situations , ” Tonegawa said , like humans .
“ But without the dentate gyrus they were very mixed up . ”
Déjà vu is a memory problem , Tonegawa explained , occurring when our brains struggle to tell the difference between two extremely similar situations .
As people age , Tonegawa said déjà - vu - like confusion happens more often — and it also happens in people suffering from brain diseases like Alzheimer ’s .
“ It ’s not surprising , ” he said , “ when you consider the fact that there ’s a loss of or damage to cells in the dentate gyrus . ”
As an aging neuroscientist , Tonegawa admitted it ’s a typical phenomenon with him .
“ I do a lot of traveling so I show up in brand new airports , and my brain tells me it ’s been here before , ” he said .
“ But the rest of my brain knows better . ”
China 's economic boom has caused pollution to soar
The Blacksmith Institute 's top 10 towns and cities included sites in ex-Soviet republics , Russia , China and India .
Peru and Zambia were also listed .
The report said an estimated 12 million people were affected by the severe pollution , which was mainly caused by chemical , metal and mining industries .
Chronic illness and premature deaths were listed as possible side - effects .
The annual review , which debuted in 2006 , is listed alphabetically , and the sites are unranked " given the wide range of location sizes , populations and pollution dynamics " .
WORST POLLUTED Sumgayit , Azerbaijan ; Potentially 275,000 affected Linfen , China ; Potentially 3 m affected Tianying , China ; Potentially 140,000 affected Sukinda , India ; Potentially 2.6 m affected Vapi , India ; Potentially 71,000 affected La Oroya , Peru ; Potentially 35,000 affected Dzerzhinsk , Russia ; Potentially 300,000 affected Norilsk , Russia ; Potentially 134,000 affected Chernobyl , Ukraine ; Potentially 5.5 m affected Kabwe , Zambia ; Potentially 255,000 affected Data : Blacksmith Institute
Among the new sites listed in 2007 were Tianying in China , where potentially 140,000 people were at risk from lead poisoning from a massive lead production base there .
The report also said that in the Indian town of Sukinda there were 12 mines operating without environmental controls , leaching dangerous chemicals into water supplies .
Sumgayit in Azerbaijan was also included in the report , which said the former Soviet industrial base was polluting the area with industrial chemicals and heavy metals .
According to the report , cancer rates in Sumgayit were as much as 51 % higher than the national average and that genetic mutations and birth defects were commonplace .
The Blacksmith Institute 's director , Richard Fuller , said : " The fact of the matter is that children are sick and dying in these polluted places , and it 's not rocket science to fix them .
" This year , there has been more focus on pollution in the media , but there has been little action in terms of new funding or programmes .
We all need to step up to the plate and get moving , " he said .

BBC News , Wakhan Corridor , north - east Afghanistan
Alex and Eleanor Duncan have taken their family to Afghanistan
Strolling out along the narrow tracks between the streams and the golden wheat harvest , Dr Alex Duncan is clutching a set of children 's scales and is off for his first consultation of the day .
With him are two of his daughters , Ruth , three , and two - year - old Libby , who jump around the fields and irrigation ditches as if it was their back garden .
Which of course it is , as they have lived in this village high up in the Wakhan Corridor of north - eastern Afghanistan all their lives while mum and dad have been trying to improve the health of some of the poorest people on earth .
" We 're just on our way now to see a man who is being treated for tuberculosis to see if he 's gained any weight , " said the 42 year old general practitioner from Sussex .
It 's harvest time in the Wakhan and everyone is out cutting the ripened crops into bundles with small metal sickles and preparing the grain for the long winter ahead .
Eight donkeys , heads roped together in a line , are whipped with a stick and screamed at by a small boy to make them walk in circles over the golden crop , their hooves breaking the wheat grains from the stalks .
Harvesting work
In another field the farmer is further on - here the pile of grain and chaff is tossed up in the air with pitch forks to separate it once again .
Then the brightly - dressed Wakhi women , wearing red and purple materials , unusually for Afghanistan with their faces uncovered , step in and sieve the wheat grains down even further into a sack .
It 's a six - week process which would take a combined harvester two hours , but there is no mechanisation here .
Everything is done by hand , and if the cold and the snow comes early it 's all ruined and families will go hungry .
" All Wakhi houses are the same , " explained Alex as we dipped our heads through the small , narrow doors and into the big room which is for living , cooking , eating and sleeping .
We 're not going to be here forever , and we are having an effect on the health of the population which we could n't do in the UK and that 's a very satisfying feeling
Dr Alex Duncan
" You have a tandoor oven in the middle for baking bread and a hole in the roof for the smoke to go out , but it goes out very slowly so when they are cooking the whole house fills with smoke , and this increases child mortality from respiratory diseases by about 10 % . "
It 's one of the reasons he has discovered to explain a terrifying death rate among children - when he arrived a third died before the age of five .
Now it 's down to a quarter .
The number of deaths was a big shock to his wife Eleanor , a linguist , who has taken on the role of talking to the local women and teaching her own children every day - Ruth , Libby , Anna and Jacob , who 's the eldest at eight .
" Their lives are really hard and sometimes tragic - often tragic .
It 's not unusual for women to lose a child or two children or maybe even three , " she said .
" We have a neighbour who lives up the hill who has lost eight children and it's just heartbreaking really to see that .
Wheat is a vital part of life for people from the Wakhan Corridor
" We found it really , really hard as we come from a culture where children do n't die and here they just do die , a lot , and we had to learn from local people that they accept that this happened . "
But through learning the Wakhi language , an archaic form of dari or Persian , the Duncans discovered there were a few simple things that could make all the difference .
Firstly women would not give babies breast milk for three or four days after they were born as they thought the first milk would be bad - in fact it contains vital nutrients .
There was no deep - set cultural reason for this and so women were trained to pass on the word that the milk was good , and that has had a huge impact .
New stoves with chimneys have been designed by the community and are being tested to reduce the smoke .
And people now understand that first - cousin marriages can cause abnormalities in the children .
The Duncans have monthly child weigh - ins under a big willow tree - and in 25 other villages , monitoring their progress and offering supplements to the most vulnerable .
Vaccinations are also given out by local health workers they have trained - it 's making a difference and basic education for the women is helping reduce the number who die in childbirth , which is also a terrifying figure and one of the worst in the world .
The poor road means access to health care is beyond the reach of most , and Dr Alex 's real answer - more girls being educated - is hindered by the lack of schools with decent teachers and few bridges , which means it 's often too far for girls to walk to the nearest school .
Dr Duncan can hold clinics in such places as underneath trees
And it 's not an easy place to live for this highly - dedicated British family .
They have a typical Wakhi one - roomed mud hut too , with no running water or drains , a pit latrine , no beds and little food other than the local bread , a little bartered rice and whatever they can cram onto the truck that drives up from Kabul once a year .
The whole family hunkers down on the floor under blankets every night , and the winters are especially harsh , with temperatures as low as - 25C and just five hours of sunshine a day in the narrow valley bottom .
Handing out pills from the back of his white van - the mobile clinic - I asked Dr Duncan whether it was all worth it .
" Oh yeah , " he replied , quite energetically .
" No question about it .
We 're not going to be here forever , and we are having an effect on the health of the population which we could n't do in the UK and that 's a very satisfying feeling .
" It 's not easy .
You can't change the world in a day or save the world in six weeks , but slowly , slowly we can make some inroads .
It 's very hard , but it 's very good . "
Re : Using S3 as an infinitely large disk device ( that never breaks ) Posted by : greg13070 Posted on : Apr 18 , 2006 7:24 PM in response to : hvrietsc Reply
Also a question for the s3 filesystem gurus :
I understand that s3fs ( I think that would be a cool name for this project , do n't you all ? ) has many and versatile uses .
I am personally looking for a very easy backup / restore strategy .
On my old server I use rsync with hard links to do incremental backups to a separate physical drive , and it 's great :
I can just cd over to the backup drive and examine or restore files from any time in the past .
Backups can be incremental forever and well .. it 's just really awesome .
Anyway , now that s3 exists , I want the backups to be offsite .
Today I am using s3sync for this , but it has some limitations and is a hack ( especially with my modifications ) :
Now , I want to stop using s3sync as soon as something more suitable is available .
My naive estimation tells me that to use the s3 fuse filesystem as a backup target for rsync would require about 1 - to - 1 free - space to used - space locally to cache the fuse blocks is that correct ?
I understand they eventually can be sync'd over to s3 and purged , but in order to perform a backup all the files must be copied .
Even an incremental backup must check all the files for changes right ?
so all the blocks would have to be available locally at run time at least for a little while .
I think I can live with this limitation if correct , but I wanted to ask people here for ideas and / or optimization suggestions .
I know that I could just change strategy and use something more traditional like backup manager ( with s3 support thanks to bdixon ) , but I have become very accustomed to the tremendous benefits associated with rsync backups .
Any feedback appreciated .
Sorry for the rambling post =P
Is there a chance of eventually getting this project to run without having to rebuild fuse just to compile hello ?
I am trying to run with debian packages , and it 's dependency hell to try and get the system set up to compile fuse ( kernel - dev , etc etc etc ) .

To Pipe Or Not To Pipe 5 September , 2007
The squeak - dev mailing list is currently fired up with a debate that will be of great interest for students of the theory of language design – and for students of the politics of language design !
It started with a question by Fabio Filasieno wondering why Squeak does n’t have a “ pipe ” construct to the language to allow the result of a message - send to be the recipient of the next message , thus removing the need for parentheses , so
( ( 1 to : 100 ) select : [ : each | each odd ] ) sum .
becomes
1 to : 100 | select : [ : each | each odd ] | sum .
The debate has continued for days , including topics such as :
Is piping the right term ?
What characters could be used without confusion ?
Should a proliferation of parentheses should be seen as a ‘ code smell ’ , so the algorithm is the thing to fix , rather than the syntax ?
Why not just use an “ asPipe ” message which would alter the operation of the cascades to give this without changing the language ?
Is the benefit of this change enough to make it worth changing the syntax of Smalltalk ?
Do languages that do n’t change stagnate ?
Was the brace syntax a step too far ?
What ’s the EBNF for Smalltalk ?
( This got a definitive answer [ for 2.7 ] )
What are the differences between Smalltalk , Lisp and Perl approaches ( with Randal Schwartz revealing himself to be a long - time Smalltalker ) ?
Alan Kay has also contributed some remarks on the early development of Smalltalk , and possible future directions .

25 And the land is defiled : therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it , and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants .
If you do any of these things , the land is defiled and it will vomit out its inhabitants .
26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments , and shall not commit any of these abominations ; neither any of your own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you :
Keep my statutes and do n't commit any of these abominations .

( Because all of these abominations were done by the people who lived on the land before you , and the land is defiled . )
28 That the land spue not you out also , when ye defile it , as it spued out the nations that were before you .
Do n't make the land vomit you out , like it did to the other people who lived here before you .
29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations , even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people .
Whoever does any of these abominations will be cut off from their people .
30 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance , that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs , which were committed before you , and that ye defile not yourselves therein : I am the LORD your God .
Мининформсвязи разрабатывает собственный вариант программного обеспечения для школьных компьютеров .
До конца 2007 года в
России начнется эксперимент по внедрению свободного ПО на основе открытого кода .
Если эксперимент пройдет успешно , в дальнейшем школы будут выбирать , каким программным обеспечением пользоваться – лицензионным или свободным .
« Сегодня ведутся работы по разработке российского программного обеспечения с открытыми кодами » , – сообщил во вторник глава министерств а
Леонид Рейман в докладе Владимиру Путину о предоставлении телефонных и Интернет - услуг населению .
Для нас важно , чтобы параллельно с устранением пиратства развивались программы с открытым кодо м
По его словам , уже в этом году в Пермской области и
Татарстане пройдет эксперимент по установке нового программного обеспечения на школьные компьютеры .
« Если эксперименты пройдут успешно , то с будущего года мы начнем постепенно оборудовать школьные компьютеры российской операционной системой и российским программным обеспечением » , – пообещал министр .
Первый вице - премьер Дмитрий Медведев в рамках общенациональной программы « Образование » недавно подписал указ об обеспечении школ лицензионным программным обеспечением .
« Принято решение о том , что лицензионное программное обеспечение заменит тот безобразный пиратский контент , которым пользуются в наших школах » , – сообщил он тогда журналистам .
В соответствии с программой « Образование » планируется обеспечить школы базовым лицензионным пакето м ПО , необходимым для работы с текстами , фотографиями , аудио- и видеофайлами .
Это будут пакеты ПО ведущих мировых компаний на льготных условиях .
При этом первые три года финансирование установки новог о
ПО , а также регулярных обновлений , будет производиться за счет государства .
На эту тем у
Параллельно правительство собирается внедрять программные продукты с открытым кодом , основанные на системе Linux .
Свободное ПО будет адаптировано под школьные нужды .
« В настоящий момент они не всегда удобны для использования и не стыкуются с продуктами ведущих коммерческих производителей программ , – пояснил Дмитрий Медведев .
–
Но для нас важно , чтобы параллельно с устранением пиратства развивались программы с открытым кодом » .
В целом проект по внедрению в российские школы программ с открытым кодом представляет собой долгий процесс .
Как отметили в пресс - службе Мининформсвязи , сейчас идет проработка вопроса о том , насколько дешевле окажется внедрение свободног о
ПО , оценивается его удобство , рассматриваются варианты наиболее оптимального использования .
Сейчас основной разработчик операционных систем – Microsoft .
« Смысл создания собственног о ПО для школ в том , чтобы дать альтернативу , чтобы у школ был выбор , како е ПО использовать » , – подчеркнул представитель Минсвязи .
Всего на проект по обеспечению школ новы м ПО , как лицензионным , так и свободным , с его предварительным тестированием , государство планирует потратить 3 млрд рублей .
Создание ПО на основе открытого кода сводится к разработке дистрибутива , который затем можно будет установить на школьные компьютеры .
« Это заурядная инженерная работа не бог весть какой сложности » , – говорят эксперты .
« По стоимости это не должно быть дорого , но поскольку речь идет о государственном проекте , то цена может быть не рыночной » , – замечает независимый аналитик компьютерного рынка Андрей Анненков .
Эксперты расценивают инициативу правительства по внедрению свободного ПО как разумную и здравую .
« Для российских школ – это благо , – уверен господин Анненков . –
Не только потому , что экономически выгоднее ( бесплатно ) , но и потому , что по функциональным возможностям свободный код несравним с лицензионным софтом » .
У Linux больше профессиональных инструментов .
« В конечном итоге для школьников это хорошая база , которая расширяет их возможности в том случае , если обучение компьютерным технологиям – не только запоминание кнопок на панели инструментов » , – подчеркивает эксперт .
While browsing Google Earth last year , some users saw an interesting sight at a naval base on a Chinese shore : runways heading directly into the ocean .
Some people who may have seen such a landscape before might have questioned whether China was developing similar technology to that built by the Soviets during the Cold War , and nearly forgotten since .
On Tuesday , scientists from Tongji University in Shanghai announced that they had indeed designed a new model of the famous but largely unknown " wing - in - ground " ( WIG ) plane , Reuters reported .
The plane , which can carry up to 4 metric tons ( nearly 9,000 pounds ) , flies just 18 inches over the surface of the water , yet manages speeds of up to 180 mph .
To achieve these numbers , WIG planes use a technique called " ground effect " to achieve a high lift / drag ratio .
Wings traveling close to the water ( or ground ) feel an extra lift by a cushion of air compressed underneath them .
This enables the planes to carry extremely heavy loads while using significantly less fuel -- in the case of the Tongji plane , about half that of a similar vehicle .
The effect is not new , however .
Even the Wright brothers , whose planes flew very low to the ground compared with today 's models , took advantage of ground effect , though probably were n't aware of it .
If you 've ever noticed the speed a commercial plane feels to have just before it lands , that too is ground effect , caused by the air cushion trapped between the wings and the runway .
As I mentioned earlier , the Russians were the first to build WIGs , which they called " Ekranoplans " ( or " screen planes " ) .
Engineer Rostislav Evgenievich Alexeev of the Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau in Russia is credited as the lead designer of the 100 - meter - long planes that could carry more than 1 million pounds at speeds of up to 250 mph .
It was the middle of the Cold War , however , and the Russians kept their invention secret .
If anyone inquired about what these objects were , employees were instructed to say that they were floating stands for new high - speed boat engines .
But the grandiosity and method of travel of these beasts inspired US spies at the time to refer to the strange forms as " Caspian Sea Monsters . "
Although the Russians had plans to build 120 Orlyonok ( or " Eaglet " ) Ekanoplan models , but ended up with just four in the late ‘ 70s .
Although a good 80 % of the size of a Boeing 747 , the Orlyonok could fly for 2,000 km ( 1,200 miles ) without landing .
Sadly , one of these planes crashed and sunk , killing the entire crew .
It still remains at the bottom of the sea .
( But according to this review , it appears that you can still buy a 1:144 scale model of the plane . )
The challenges faced by the Russians in mainstreaming this technology were faced by many of their followers .
Perhaps most importantly , the immense amount of power required for planes when attempting to take off or land in the water , due to the large waves the planes create , was a problem .
Engineers also faced challenges in implementing reliable automatic control systems , protecting against corrosive sea water , and protecting the engine air intake against bird strikes .
Interestingly , in 2002 , Boeing was looking into building a gigantic WIG plane called the " Pelican . "
The company 's goals are astounding : the plane would be 300 feet long with a 500 - foot wingspan , fly 10 times the speed of cargo planes , carry 1.5 million pounds , and cover 10,000 nautical miles on a tank of fuel .
Besides these plans , however , the Pelican is still in the works .
As for the scientists at Tongji University , they plan to develop a 50 - seat WIG by 2013 , with 200 prototypes capable of carrying 200 to 400 metric tons scheduled for 2016 or 2017 .
Military , commercial and even space uses could be in the future for WIG technology .

Israeli fighter jets breached Lebanese airspace on Friday and flew over southern Lebanese areas and the Bekaa Valley , the official National News Agency ( NNA ) reported .
The report quoted security sources as saying that Israel 's fighter jets flew at a high altitude over Arqoub , Hasbiya , West Bekaa , Iqlim Al - Tufah and Marjiyoun as well as over the south .
Meanwhile , a statement by the Lebanese Army 's Guidance Directorate said an Israeli scouting plane breached Lebanese airspace after midnight from the sea area by Naqoura town in the south .
It then headed north and made a round over Beirut before exiting .
Israel has continued to carry out flights over Lebanese territory despite a UN - brokered ceasefire , which ended the 34 - day Israel - Hezbollah war on Aug. 14 of 2006 .
The Jewish state repeatedly announced that it would continue controversial flights over Lebanon , saying they were needed to stem alleged arms smuggling to Hezbollah .

Do n’t Hate PowerPoint ; Hate the PowerPointers
Even though I try hard to avoid meetings in general , and business meetings in particular , I have sat through my share of PowerPoint presentations .
In general , I hate them .
There are at least two big problems with PowerPoint presentations .
The first is that the speaker , because he ’s got the visual crutch of the slide show , does n’t work very hard to communicate well with his actual words .
If the slides are really good , you can get away with this — but then you start wondering why the guy did n’t just send you his slides and leave you alone .
The second problem is that PowerPoint seems to encourage a kind of bullet - point thinking that ’s just not that interesting , and in its reductiveness can be downright dangerous .
That , at least , is the argument of Edward Tufte , the visual - data guru who hates PowerPoint so much that he wrote a monograph about its failings .
I was reminded of all this today while reading Lee Gomes ‘s column in today ’s Wall Street Journal .
PowerPoint , it so happens , has just turned 20 years old , and Gomes ’s piece swiftly covers a lot of interesting ground : its origins as a Mac program ( which I did n’t know ) , its rapid sale to Microsoft for $ 14 million , and Tufte ’s objections to how Power Point has come to be used .
But by far the best part of the column is the reflections of Robert Gaskins and Dennis Austin , the creators of PowerPoint .
To a large degree , they share the frustration of everyone like me and Tufte about how PowerPoint has come to be used : “ It ’s just like the printing press , ” Austin tells Gomes .
“ It enabled all sorts of garbage to be printed . ”
As Gomes writes , Austin and Gaskins also like “ telling the joke that the best way to paralyze an opposition army is to ship it PowerPoint and , thus , contaminate its decision making , something some analysts say has happened at the Pentagon . ”
FWIW , I recently saw a great PowerPoint presentation , given by the writer Josh Kilmer - Purcell at this Google conference .
It can be done .
Spurred on by today ’s Gomes piece , I vow to adopt a new outlook : do n’t hate PowerPoint ; hate the PowerPointers .
Google wants to know what you search for , and plenty of people have wondered why .
The company 's global privacy counsel , Peter Fleischer , recently posted an explanation to this question of Google 's official blog , and his answers are quite simple : logging leads to better search , less fraud , and government compliance .
Nothing evil about that , is there ?
Two months ago , Google announced a plan to anonymize its logs , but only after retaining the data for 18 to 24 months .
After that time , user searches will still be stored , but it should be impossible to link search queries up with individual users .
Of course , this is what AOL researchers thought when they released their own search logs , but queries often turn out to be highly specific things ... the sort of things that can eventually be used to identify individuals .
Commentators generally praised Google for at least taking steps to safeguard the privacy of information , but others wondered why Google truly needed to retain this information at all .
According to Fleischer , log data is used to improve core Google search services , including the spell check component .
" Google 's spell checking software automatically looks at your query and checks to see if you are using the most common version of a word 's spelling , " Fleischer says .
" If it calculates that you 're likely to generate more relevant search results with an alternative spelling , it will ask ' Did you mean : ( more common spelling ) ? '
We can offer this service by looking at spelling corrections that people do or do not click on .
Similarly , with logs , we can improve our search results : if we know that people are clicking on the # 1 result we 're doing something right , and if they 're hitting next page or reformulating their query , we 're doing something wrong . "
Sounds good — though it's not clear why this could n't be done just as well with anonymous data .
The company also uses the information to deal with fraud and abuse .
" Immediate deletion of IP addresses from our logs would make our systems more vulnerable to security attacks , putting the personal data of our users at greater risk , " says Fleischer .
" Historical logs information can also be a useful tool to help us detect and prevent phishing , scripting attacks , and spam , including query click spam and ads click spam . "
But when it comes to the issue of government compliance , the argument gets less straightforward .
Fleischer claims that retaining personal data for two years is necessary because of European and US data protection laws , even though those laws do not yet exist .
The EU's Data Retention Directive was passed in late 2005 but has yet to be implemented by the various member states ( which have until 2009 ) .
The law requires each country in the EU to adopt a retention requirement of between six and 24 months .
" Since these laws do not yet exist , and are only now being proposed and debated , " Fleischer says , " it is too early to know the final retention time periods , the jurisdictional impact , and the scope of applicability .
It 's therefore too early to state whether such laws would apply to particular Google services , and if so , which ones . "
Even though the laws are not yet in force in Europe and wo n't apply retroactively , Google still uses the law as an argument to retain data now , and to do so for the longest possible period the law provides for .
In the US , no general data retention laws have been passed , though the government has mooted numerous proposals for a two - year retention requirement to combat child pornography and other ills .
Fleischer suggests that Google 's behavior is proper because the government has simply " called for 24 - month data retention laws . "
In the past , the company has stood up for user privacy against Department of Justice subpoena requests , and it has adopted a comprehensive anonymity policy .
But the company does itself no favors by engaging in some rhetorical sleight of hand and claiming that laws which do n't yet exist ought to guide its current behavior ; just admit that the reasons are business - related and be done with it .

A deadly flu pandemic sweeping Britain would force local councils to dig mass graves outside cemeteries and reuse coffins at crematoria , a Home Office report reveals .
Funeral parlours and crematorium staff would have to work around - the - clock seven days a week , while funeral services would be reduced to the most basic " no - frills " ceremonies without hymns or eulogies to save time .
Doctors and coroners would be dragged out or retirement to help cope with the numbers of dead .
Even benefits offices would have to take on extra staff to handle the numbers applying for cash hand - outs to cover funeral expenses and as family breadwinners die .
The grim predictions form part of a Home Office consultation to help plan the practical steps needed to deal with a pandemic .
The document warns that an outbreak could cause 650,000 ' extra ' deaths over a four month period , and adds : " History and science suggest that we are very likely to face influenza pandemics this century . "
Previous Department of Health reports have put the figure at up to 750,000 .
The Home Office study looks at the problems of maintaining " dignity and respect " for vast numbers of dead bodies , while struggling to maintain legal checks on such huge numbers of deaths , once the volume of cases and staff illness and death combine to make normal processes " unsustainable " .
" Cemetery managers are likely to want to move to provision of common graves , which would allow interments to be undertaken more quickly due to the more efficient mechanical preparation of the site " , according to the paper , entitled Planning For A Possible Influenza Epidemic .
These mass graves may have to be dug on new sites outside cemeteries if space runs out , it adds , particularly in inner city areas .
Families ' choice of funeral services is likely to be severely curtailed , even if funeral directors take on more staff and stay open seven days a week offering a minimal service - with no special cars for mourners , for example .
Congested crematorium chapels will have insist on basic , shorter services , with longer memorial services held elsewhere , and cemeteries will have offer " shorter time slots " for burials .
Shortages of coffins could become a serious problem , and the document even suggests removing bodies to cremate them separately , so that the coffin can be re-used .
Hospitals and local authorities will try to minimise the huge pressure on mortuaries by moving bodies to burial as quickly as possible .
Even so , large temporary sites are likely to be needed using tents or cargo containers to hold bodies .
The policy would be to avoid using refrigerated trucks as overspill mortuaries , but that could quickly become ' unsustainable ' as space runs out , the study admits .
Registrars , coroners and doctors would also struggle to keep up with the volume of death certificates and registrations .
As well as bringing doctors out of retirement to help , nurses could be given emergency powers to sign death certificates .
With thousands of prisoners likely to die in jail , the need for full inquests into all deaths in custody could be suspended under more emergency powers .
Registrars would stop bothering with births and marriages during a pandemic and concentrate on trying to keep proper records of deaths .
They may have to stay open around the clock and take details over the phone rather than face - to - face .
The last influenza pandemic occurred in 1968 - 9 , when a newly mutated virus known as Hong Kong flu killed an estimated one million people worldwide , including thousands in the UK .
The FBI and IRS 's execution yesterday afternoon of a search warrant on the Alaska home of GOP Senator Ted Steven has been widely reported by now .
What 's striking is this tidbit in today 's WaPo : Stevens said in a statement that his attorneys were advised of the impending search yesterday morning .
I spent nearly 9 years as a federal prosecutor .
I 'm not aware of a single instance when any prosecutor or agent told anyone outside the Justice Department that a search warrant was going to be executed later in the day .
Telling outsiders -- especially lawyers for the person whose property will be searched -- defeats one of the principal purposes of a search warrant : SURPRISE to ensure the integrity of the evidence field .
If you 're going to tell the target of the search in advance , then why not just serve a subpoena and trust in compliance ?
Now Stevens ' reported comment may have been a spin on a phone call from someone at DOJ when the agents were at the front door or the agents themselves calling Stevens ' attorneys to ask for the key .
But those seem more than a stretch considering that Stevens says the tip came in the a.m. , and the search was executed in the p.m .
Maybe it 's spin .
Or maybe someone at DOJ broke a cardinal principle .
Certainly , only a few people would have known about the impending search : the prosecutors conducting the investigation , the team of agents preparing to execute the search . . . and high - level DOJ officials who , considering that Stevens is a U.S. Senator , would have had to approve the search .
Regardless , one thing is clear about Stevens ' status from the use of a search warrant .
He is now squarely in the cross-hairs of a federal criminal investigation .
According to the Justice Department 's Criminal Resource Manual Sec. 659 : A search warrant should not be used to obtain documentary materials believed to be in the private possession of a disinterested third party unless it appears that the use of a subpoena , summons , request , or other less intrusive alternative means of obtaining the materials would substantially jeopardize the availability or usefulness of the materials sought , and the application for the warrant has been authorized as provided in paragraph ( a ) ( 2 ) of this section .
Ted Stevens , clearly , is no " disinterested third party . "
More likely , given the hoopla a search warrant 's execution creates , Stevens is a target -- defined by the U.S. Attorney 's Manual Sec. 9-11.151 this way : " A ' target ' is a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who , in the judgment of the prosecutor , is a putative defendant . "
In any case , while on the one hand , it 's just this sort of event -- a federal search warrant executed against a powerful politician of the same party as the administration -- that suggests the professionals in the Justice Department are doing their job , the remark WaPo attributed to Stevens -- that his attorneys were given a heads - up -- reminds that this Justice Department works very differently at the top than on the line .
If it 's true that Stevens ' lawyers had a heads - up about the search , I think it 's more than fair to ask questions -- and to get answers -- about exactly who told Stevens ' lawyers about the afternoon 's planned search , who approved the disclosure , and what was the purpose of the tip - off .

Scientists at a modest university in a small town in New Hampshire offered today a big tip to city planners around the world : Prepare your culverts for global warming .
Nearly a foot of rain this weekend in Keene , NH , overwhelming the storm drains .
Latham Stack Michael Simpson at Antioch New England Graduate School were not surprised .
They had just finished studying culverts in Keene and looking at climate models that forecast more frequent downpours like this in the future .
Current design specifications for culvert sizes are " inadequate to handle the rainfall intensities predicted under climate change , " the researchers say .
The 11.5 inches of rain during a 24 - hour period this past weekend was nearly three times more than what the culverts were designed to handle .
The result : neighborhood flooding and road erosion .
The city declared a state of emergency Sunday .
While upgrading culverts will be expensive , the price tag would be " comparatively small in relation to costs incurred by the private and public sectors in the wake of the current storm , " the scientists argue .
" Our research focused only on a small section of Keene , NH , but the model we developed to project climate change induced culvert failures could be applied to any region of the world , " Simpson said .
While theorists are n't sure how much the climate will warm , most agree there is an inevitable degree or more of change ahead by the end of the century .
Already global warming is reducing the amount of permafrost around the globe , causing glaciers to recede at unprecedented rates , and possibly fueling more intense hurricanes .
Seas will rise , scientists say , threatening coastal areas .
Rainfall patterns are also likely to shift , with some areas experiencing more drought and others getting heavier downpours .
And while scientists can't predict exactly where the changes will occur and to what extent , the new study points out that the time to prepare may be now .
" We may have a window of opportunity to prepare civil infrastructures , " Stack said .
" While expensive , these preparations can be affordable if undertaken far enough in advance . "
After declaring their own war on BitTorrent , players from the porn industry have been debating The Pirate Bay 's calls for police action after major media companies tried to illegally sabotage their operations .
Surprisingly there are huge divisions , with many players openly supporting the operators of the world 's largest BitTorrent tracker and some are even donating .
The fallout from the MediaDefender debacle has seemingly reached every corner of the Internet , with sites springing up dedicated to the dissemination of every last detail of the leak , it seems everyone with an interest in BitTorrent has this hot topic on their lips .
Following the revelations that ‘ Big Media ’ hired MediaDefender to illegally sabotage The Pirate Bay ’s activities in Sweden , we reported that complaints have been filed with the police .
The porn industry – already in the early stages of its own personal war against BitTorrent – could ’ve been expected to demonstrate a united front in support of MediaDefender and its actions against The Pirate Bay .
This is not the case .
They are hugely divided with many openly supporting the world ’s most famous pirates , with some even making it public that they are donating hard cash to help their cause .
Using language as filthy as their movies ( mostly without spell - checkers ) , those of a sensitive nature should proceed with caution when reading these quotes from some of the longest - standing senior members on the porn industry ’s GFY forums :
It all started in quite a civil manner , with Madrox quite correctly pointing out : “ well what they are trying to do to PirateBay is illegal , so i guess they are trying to fight fire with fire , i hope PB wins … ” to which a disbelieving 34,000 - post count “ tony404 ” responded angrily : “ Your fucking kidding right ? ”
Jace goes on to demonstrate the reality of the situation : “ the fucked up part is that what the thepiratebay is doing in their country is legal , and what the movie companies are doing in the country of thepiratebat is ILLEGAL , so there is a good chance this will be a pretty damn good fight ” to which GhostCash Rush responded : “ I agree .
This is the one shot Gottfrid has been waiting for . ”
Madrox steps in again : “ and thats exactly the reason why im rooting for PB , sure its illegal over here for what they are doing , but they are n’t doing anything illegal in their own country , so im not gonna hate them for breaking laws in another country … premarital sex is illegal in a lot of 3rd world countries , but oh wait , not in America , but you do n’t see them trying to sue us do ya ? ”
….. which provoked several “ fuck you ” and “ asshole ” comments from people who are clearly hugely frustrated by their limited legal and geographical knowledge .
According to will76 , Sweden is a 3rd world country “ where hacking is legal you dumb fucks ” and while pointing out their ‘ legal ’ page claims TPB staff are “ cocky mother fuckers asking for trouble ” .
At this point , in steps ‘ RawAlex ’ who has more to say on this matter than anyone else on the porn industry forum and has some really ‘ interesting ’ ideas about the legality of TPB and copyright law : “ The funny part is that piratebay would have to first admit what is on those trackers .
So they would have to admit to sharing copyright material in the first place before they could move forward . ”
TPB host only . torrent files and never distribute copyright works , that ’s why they are legal in Sweden and are still operating .
So we can all ‘ move forward ’ now …with some common sense from ‘ hungry hungry hippy ’ :
“ usa law stops at the borders , tpb does nothing illegal in their country , period .
because you ca n’t come to grips with that does not mean you can go vigilante and hack them – that is illegal in both countries .
sorry to interrupt the whine fest , someone want to pass the cheese ? ”
… to which RawAlex responds : “ Sorry moron , but you forget that piratebay does n’t limit themselves to distributing stuff in Sweden – they distribute worldwide . ”
Sorry to correct you again Alex – they do n’t distribute anything but . torrent files – which are totally legal .
‘ Amputate Your Head ’ , a member since 2001 supports Pirate Bay “ fully ” while ‘ Dirty Franck ’ explains that he “ just donated 200 bucks to PB for their case ” along with ‘ Bang.TV ‘.
Pryda exclaims : “ Go Pirate Bay !
I always loved them , but now I ’m rooting for them even more , since I read the MediaDefender story . ”
Matt 26z makes an interesting point when he refers to legal issues faced by many adult webmasters :
“ If you support The PirateBay being brought to justice in other countries for doing what is perfectly legal in their own country , then you MUST support the extradition of adult webmasters to China to face trial .
This is the WORLD wide web .
With that comes severely conflicting beliefs and laws that clash online . ”
After the industry claimed to have taken down the ijsklontje.nl site recently , one has to wonder how on earth this was possible .
The only people who have a grasp of the law on GFY are the ones coming out in favor of The Pirate Bay , which leaves the ill - informed to make hollow threats and blow hot air .
This all adds credence to the claims that ijsklontje.nl was taken down by its owners own choice and actually had nothing to do with porn industry action .
I ’ll leave the last comment with RawAlex : “ If they want to steal from others and profit from it , they should get fucked up the ass with a broomstick without lube ” – an idea he probably pirated from TPB ’s legal page as they corresponded with the lawyers from Dreamworks , although substituting ‘ retractable batons ‘ with ‘ broomsticks ’ probably keeps him safe from copyright police persecution .
So in this blog I going to make posts about " EVERYTHING " From culinary to fashion and advice .
Then for the first post , I am going to give some body care tips , so lets go !
Testimony of Robert Kuttner
Before the Committee on Financial Services
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington , D.C .
October 2 , 2007
Although the particulars are different , my reading of financial history suggests that the abuses and risks are all too similar and enduring .
When you strip them down to their essence , they are variations on a few hardy perennials - excessive leveraging , misrepresentation , insider conflicts of interest , non-transparency , and the triumph of engineered euphoria over evidence .
The most basic and alarming parallel is the creation of asset bubbles
This was the essence of the abuse of public utilities stock pyramids in the 1920s , where multi-layered holding companies allowed securities to be watered down
A second parallel is what today we would call securitization of credit
Banks would originate and repackage highly speculative loans
It was this practice , and the ensuing collapse when so much of the paper went bad , that led Congress to enact the Glass - Steagall Act
much of this paper is even more opaque to bank examiners than its counterparts were in the 1920s
A third parallel is the excessive use of leverage
But anybody who knows anything about derivatives or hedge funds knows that margin
limits are for little people .
High rollers , with credit derivatives , can use leverage at ratios
of ten to one , or a hundred to one , limited only by their self confidence and taste for risk .
Private equity , which might be better named private debt , gets its astronomically high
rate of return on equity capital , through the use of borrowed money .
The equity is fairly
small .
The fourth parallel is the corruption of the gatekeepers
In this decade , it remains to be seen whether the bond rating agencies were corrupted by conflicts of interest , or merely incompetent .
The core structural conflict is that the rating agencies are paid by the firms that issue the bonds .
Who gets the business - the rating agencies with tough standards or generous ones ?
Are ratings for sale ?
And what , really , is the technical basis for their ratings ?
Today 's examiner is not able to value a lot of the paper held by banks , and must rely on the banks ' own models , which clearly failed to predict what happened in the case of sub - prime .
at best the regulatory agencies can only make educated guesses about whether balance sheets are strong enough to withstand pressures when novel and exotic instruments create market conditions that cannot be anticipated by models
The regulatory reforms of the New Deal saved capitalism from its own self - cannibalizing instincts , and a reliable , transparent and regulated financial economy went on to anchor an unprecedented boom in the real economy .
Financial markets were restored to their appropriate role as servants of the real economy , rather than masters
But a general depression was not triggered by the market collapse , because the Fed again came to the rescue with very cheap money
Otherwise , the Fed just invites moral hazards and more rounds of wildly irresponsible actions
The result was an old fashioned run on a
large bank , and the Bank of England changed its tune
the Fed needs to remember its other role
But the other lever , one that has fallen into disrepair and disrepute , is preventive regulation
In the 1994 legislation , Congress not only gave the Fed the authority , but directed the Fed to clamp down on dangerous and predatory lending practices , including on otherwise unregulated entities such as sub - prime mortgage originators .
However , for 13 years the Fed stonewalled and declined to use the authority that Congress gave it to police sub - prime lending
There is a vicious circle - a self - fulfilling prophecy - in which remedies that currently are legislatively unthinkable are not given serious thought
Maybe we should just close the loophole in the 1940 Act and require of hedge funds and private equity firms the same kinds of disclosures required of others who sell shares to the public , which in effect is what hedge funds and private equity increasingly do .
The industry will say that this kind of disclosure impinges on trade secrets .
To the extent that this concern is valid , the disclosure of positions and strategies can be to the SEC .
This is what is required of large hedge funds by the Financial Services Authority in the UK , not a nation noted for hostility to hedge funds .
Indeed , Warren Buffet 's Berkshire Hathaway , which might have chosen to operate as private equity , makes the same disclosures as any other publicly listed firm .
It does n't seem to hurt Buffett at all .
Why not have tighter regulation both of derivatives that are publicly traded and those that are currently regulated - rather weakly - by the CFTC : more disclosure , limits on leverage and on positions .
And why not make OTC and special purpose derivatives that are not ordinarily traded ( and that are black holes in terms of asset valuation ) , also subject to the CFTC ?
Thank you for this opportunity .
My name is Robert Kuttner .
I am an economics andfinancial journalist , author of several books about the economy , a magazine editor , and former investigator for the Senate Banking Committee .
I have a book appearing in a few weeks that addresses the systemic risks of financial innovation coupled with deregulation and the moral hazard of periodic bailouts .
In researching the book , I devoted a lot of effort to reviewing the abuses of the 1920s , the effort in the 1930s to create a financial system that would prevent repetition of those abuses , and the steady dismantling of the safeguards over the last three decades in the name of free markets and financial innovation .
The Senate Banking Committee , in the celebrated Pecora Hearings of 1933 and 1934 , laid the groundwork for the modern edifice of financial regulation .
I suspect that they would be appalled at the parallels between the systemic risks of the 1920s and many of the modern practices that have been permitted to seep back in to our financial markets . , in which thepurveyors of securities use very high leverage ; the securities are sold to the public or to specialized funds with underlying collateral of uncertain value ; and financial middlemen extract exorbitant returns at the expense of the real economy . , to the point where the real collateral was worth just a few cents on the dollar , and returns were diverted from operating companies and ratepayers .
This only became exposed when the bubble burst .
As Warren Buffett famously put it , you never know who is swimming naked until the tide goes out .
There is good evidence -- and I will add to the record a paper on this subject by the Federal Reserve staff economists Dean Maki and Michael Palumbo -- that even much of the boom of the late 1990s was built substantially on asset bubbles . ( " Disentangling the Wealth Effect : a Cohort Analysis of Household Savings in the 1990s , " ) .
Some people think this is a recent innovation , but in fact it was the core technique that made possible the dangerous practices of the 1920 . , market them as securities through their retail networks , using the prestigious brand name of the bank - e.g. Morgan or Chase - as a proxy for the soundness of the security . , requiring bankers to decide either to be commercial banks — part of the monetary system , closely supervised and subject to reserve requirements , given deposit insurance , and access to the Fed ’s discount window ; or investment banks that were not government guaranteed , but that were soon subjected to an extensive disclosure regime under the SEC .
Since repeal of Glass Steagall in 1999 , after more than a decade of de facto inroads , super - banks have been able to re-enact the same kinds of structural conflicts of interestthat were endemic in the 1920s - lending to speculators , packaging and securitizing credits and then selling them off , wholesale or retail , and extracting fees at every step along the way .
And , .
Much of it is n't paper at all , and the whole process is supercharged by computers and automated formulas .
An independent source of instability is that while these credit derivatives are said to increase liquidity and serve as shock absorbers , in fact their bets are often in the same direction - assuming perpetually rising asset prices - so in a credit crisis they can act as net de-stabilizers ..
In the 1920s , not only were there pervasive stock - watering schemes , but there was no limit on margin .
If you thought the market was just going up forever , you could borrow most of the cost of your investment , via loans conveniently provided by your stockbroker .
It worked well on the upside .
When it did n't work so well on the downside , Congress subsequently imposed margin limits .
As in the 1920s , the game continues only as long as asset prices continue to inflate ; and all the leverage contributes to the asset inflation , conveniently creating higher priced collateral against which to borrow even more money ..
In the 1920s , the corrupted insiders were brokers running stock pools and bankers as purveyors of watered stock .
( In the ) 1990s , it was accountants , auditors and stock analysts , who were supposedly agents of investors , but who turned out to be confederates of corporate executives .
You can give this an antiseptic academic term and call it a failure of agency , but a better phrase is conflicts of interest .
All of this is opaque , and unregulated , and only now being investigated by Congress and the SEC .
Yet another parallel is the failure of regulation to keep up with financial innovation that is either far too risky to justify the benefit to the real economy , or just plain corrupt , or both .
In the 1920s , many of these securities were utterly opaque .
Ferdinand Pecora , in his 1939 memoirs describing the pyramid schemes of public utility holding companies , the most notorious of which was controlled by the Insull family , opined that the pyramid structure was not even fully understood by Mr. Insull .
The same could be said of many of today ’s derivatives on which technical traders make their fortunes .
By contrast , in the traditional banking system a bank examiner could look at a bank 's loan portfolio , see that loans were backed by collateral and verify that they were performing .
If they were not , the bank was made to increase its reserves .
Thelargest banking conglomerates are subjected to consolidated regulation , but the jurisdiction is fragmented , and A last parallel is ideological - the nearly universal conviction , 80 years ago and today , that markets are so perfectly self - regulating that government 's main job is to protect property rights , and otherwise just get out of the way .
We all know the history ..
Financial regulation was pro-efficiency .
I want to repeat that , because it is so utterly unfashionable , but it is well documented by economic history .
Financial regulation was pro-efficiency .
America ’s squeaky clean , transparent , reliable financial markets were the envy of the world .
They undergirded the entrepreneurship and dynamism in the rest of the economy .
Beginning in the late 1970s , the beneficial effect of financial regulations has either beendeliberately weakened by public policy , or has been overwhelmed by innovations notanticipated by the New Deal regulatory schema .
New - Deal - era has become a term ofabuse .
Who needs New Deal protections in an Internet age ?
Of course , there are some important differences between the economy of the 1920s , and the one that began in the deregulatory era that dates to the late 1970s .
The economy did not crash in 1987 with the stock market , or in 2000 - 01 .
Among the reasons are the existence of federal breakwaters such as deposit insurance , and the stabilizing influence of public spending , now nearly one dollar in three counting federal , state , and local public outlay , which limits collapses of private demand .
But I will focus on just one difference - the most important one .
In the 1920s and early1930s , the Federal Reserve had neither the tools , nor the experience , nor the self - confidence to act decisively in a credit crisis .
But today , whenever the speculative excesses lead to a crash , the Fed races to the rescue .
No , it does n't bail our every single speculator ( though it did a pretty good job in the two Mexican rescues ) but it bails out the speculative system , so that the next round of excess can proceed .
And somehow , this is scored as trusting free markets , overlooking the plain fact that the Fed is part of the U.S. government .
When big banks lost many tens of billions on third world loans in the 1980s , the Fed and the Treasury collaborated on workouts , and desisted from requiring that the loans be marked to market , lest several money center banks be declared insolvent .
When Citibank was under water in 1990 , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York personally undertook a secret mission to Riyadh to persuade a Saudi prince to pump in billions in capital and to agree to be a passive investor .
In 1998 , the Fed convened a meeting of the big banks and all but ordered a bailout of Long Term Capital Management , an uninsured and unregulated hedge fund whose collapse was nonetheless putting the broad capital markets at risk .
And even though Chairman Greenspan had expressed worry two years ( and several thousand points ) earlier that " irrational exuberance " was creating a stock market bubble , big losses in currency speculation in East Asia and Russia led Greenspan to keep cutting rates , despite his foreboding that cheaper money would just pump up markets and invite still more speculation .
And finally in the dot - com crash of 2000 - 01 , the speculative abuses and insider conflicts of interest that fueled the stock bubble were very reminiscent of 1929 .
So when things are booming , the financial engineers can advise government not to spoil the party .
But when things go bust , they can count on the Fed to rescue them with emergency infusions of cash and cheaper interest rates .
I just read Chairman Greenspan 's fascinating memoir , which confirms this rescue role .
His memoir also confirms Mr. Greenspan 's strong support for free markets and his deep antipathy to regulation .
But I do n't see how you can have it both ways .
If you are a complete believer in the proposition that free markets are self - regulating and self - correcting , then you logically should let markets live with the consequences .
On the other hand , if you are going to rescue markets from their excesses , on the very reasonable ground that a crash threatens the entire system , then you have an obligation to act pre-emptively , prophylactically , to head off highly risky speculative behavior .
While the Fed and the European Central Bank were flooding markets with liquidity toprevent a deeper crash in August and September , the Bank of England decided on asterner course .
It would not reward speculators .
So the point is not that the Fed should let the whole economy collapse in order to teach speculators a lesson .
The point is that - as regulator .
One of the odd things about the press commentary about what the Fed should do is that it has been entirely along one dimension : a Hobson 's choice : - either loosen money and invite more risky behavior , or refuse to enable asset bubbles and risk a more serious credit crunch - as if these were the only options and monetary policy were the only policy lever .
Mr. Chairman , you have had a series of hearings on the sub - prime collapse , which has now been revealed as a textbook case of regulatory failure .
About half of these loans were originated by non-federally regulated mortgage companies .
However even those sub - prime loans should have had their underwriting standards policed by the Federal Reserve or its designee under the authority of the 1994 Home Equity and Ownership Protection Act .
And by the same token , the SEC should have more closely monitored the so called counterparties - the investment and commercial banks - that were supplying the credit .
However , the Fed and the SEC essentially concluded that since the paper was being sold off to investors who presumably were cognizant of the risks , they did not need to pay attention to the deplorable underwriting standards ..
Even as recently as last spring , when you could not pick up a newspaper 's financial pages without reading about the worsening sub - prime disaster , the Fed did not act - until this Committee made an issue of it .
Financial markets have responded to the 50 basis - point rate - cut , by bidding up stock prices , as if this crisis were over .
Indeed , the financial pages have reported that as the softness in housing markets is expected to worsen , traders on Wall Street have inferred that the Fed will need to cut rates again , which has to be good for stock prices .
Mr. Chairman , we are living on borrowed time .
And the vulnerability goes far beyond the spillover effects of the sub - prime debacle .
We need to step back and consider the purpose of regulation .
Financial regulation is too often understood as merely protecting consumers and investors .
The New Deal model is actually a relatively indirect one , since it relies more on mandated disclosures , and less on prohibited practices .
The enormous loopholes in financial regulation - the hedge fund loophole , the private equity loophole , are justified on the premise that consenting adults of substantial means do not need the help of the nanny state , thank you very much .
But of course investor protection is only one purpose of regulation .
The other purpose is to protect the system from moral hazard and catastrophic risk of financial collapse .
It is this latter function that has been seriously compromised .
HOEPA was understood mainly as consumer protection legislation , but it was also systemic risk legislation .
Sarbanes - Oxley has been attacked in some quarters as harmful to the efficiency of financial markets .
One good thing about the sub - prime calamity is that we have n't heard a lot of that argument lately .
Yet there is still a general bias in the administration and the financial community against regulation .
Mr. Chairman , I commend you and this committee for looking beyond the immediateproblem of the sub - prime collapse .
I would urge every member of the committee to spendsome time reading the Pecora hearings , and you will be startled by the sense of deja vu .
I 'd like to close with an observation and a recommendation .
My perception as a financial journalist is that regulation is so out of fashion these days that it narrows the legislative imagination , since politics necessarily is the art of the possible and your immediate task is to find remedies that actually stand a chance of enactment ..
Mr. Chairman , you are performing an immense public service by broadening the scope of inquiry beyond the immediate crisis and immediate legislation .
Three decades ago , a group of economists inspired by the work of the late Milton Friedman created a shadow Federal Open Market Committee , to develop and recommend contrarian policies in the spirit of Professor Friedman ’s recommendation that monetary policy essentially be put on automatic pilot .
The committee had great intellectual and political influence , and its very existence helped people think through dissenting ideas .
In the same way , the national security agencies often create Team B exercises to challenge the dominant thinking on a defense issue .
In the coming months , I hope the committee hears from a wide circle of experts - academics , former state and federal regulators , financial historians , people who spent time on Wall Street - who are willing to look beyond today 's intellectual premises and legislative limitations , and have ideas about what needs to be re-regulated .
Here are some of the questions that require further exploration :
First , which kinds innovations of financial engineering actually enhance economic efficiency , and which ones mainly enrich middlemen , strip assets , appropriate wealth , and increase systemic risk ?
It no longer works to assert that all innovations , by definition , are good for markets or markets would n’t invent them .
We just tested that proposition in the sub - prime crisis , and it failed .
But which forms of credit derivatives , for example , truly make markets more liquid and better able to withstand shocks , and which add to the system 's vulnerability .
We can't just settle that question by the all purpose assumption that market forces invariably enhance efficiency .
We have to get down to cases .
The story of the economic growth in the 1990s and in this decade is mainly a story of technology , increased productivity growth , macro-economic stimulation , and occasionally of asset bubbles .
There is little evidence that the growth rates of the past decade and a half - better than the 1970s and ' 80s , worse than the 40's , 50's and '60s - required or benefited from new techniques of financial engineering .
I once did some calculations on what benefits securitization of mortgage credit had actually had .
By the time you net out the fee income taken out by all of the middlemen - the mortgage broker , the mortgage banker , the investment banker , the bond - rating agency - it 's not clear that the borrower benefits at all .
What does increase , however , are the fees and the systemic risks .
More research on this question would be useful .
What would be the result of the secondary mortgage market were far more tightly subjected to standards ?
It is telling that the mortgages that best survived the meltdown were those that met the underwriting criteria of the GSE's .
Second , what techniques and strategies of regulation are appropriate to damp down the systemic risks produced by the financial innovation ?
As I observed , when you strip it all down , at the heart of the recent financial crises are three basic abuses : lack of transparency ; excessive leverage ; and conflicts of interest .
Those in turn suggest remedies : greater disclosure either to regulators or to the public .
Requirement of increased reserves in direct proportion to how opaque and difficult to value are the assets held by banks .
Some restoration of the walls against conflicts of interest once provided by Glass Steagall .
Tax policies to discourage dangerously high leverage ratios , in whatever form .
To the extent that some private equity firms and strategies strip assets , while others add capital and improve management , maybe we need a windfall profits tax on short term extraction of assets and on excess transaction fees .
If private equity has a constructive role to play - and I think it can - we need public policies to reward good practices and discourage bad ones .
Industry codes , of the sort being organized by the administration and the industry itself , are far too weak .
A third big question to be addressed is the relationship of financial engineering to problems of corporate governance .
Ever since the classic insight of A.A. Berle and Gardiner Means in 1933 , it has been conventional to point out that corporate management is not adequately responsible to shareholders , and by extension to society , because of the separation of ownership from effective control .
The problem , if anything , is more serious today than when Berle and Means wrote in 1933 , because of the increased access of insiders to financial engineering .
We have seen the fruits of that access in management buyouts , at the expense of both other shareholders , workers , and other stakeholders .
This is pure conflict of interest .
Since the first leveraged buyout boom , advocates of hostile takeovers have proposed a radically libertarian solution to the Berle - Means problem .
Let a market for corporate control hold managers accountable by buying , selling , and recombining entire companies via LBOs that tax deductible money collateralized by the target ’s own assets .
It is astonishing that this is even legal , let alone rewarded by tax preferences , even more so when managers with a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders are on both sides of the bargain .
The first boom in hostile takeovers crashed and burned .
The second boom ended with the stock market collapse of 2000 - 01 .
The latest one is rife with conflicts of interest , it depends heavily on the perception that stock prices are going to continue to rise at multiples that far outstrip the rate of economic growth , and on the borrowed money to finance these deals that puts banks increasingly at risk .
So we need a careful examination of better ways of holding managers accountable - through more power for shareholders and other stakeholders such as employees , proxy rules not tilted to incumbent management , and rules that reward mutual funds for serving as the agents of shareholders , and not just of the profit maximization of the fund sponsor .
John Bogle , a pioneer in the modern mutual fund industry , has written eloquently on this .
Interestingly , the intellectual fathers of the leveraged buyout movement as a supposed source of better corporate governance , have lately been having serious second thoughts .
Michael Jensen , one of the original theorists of efficient market theory and the so called market for corporate control and an advocate of compensation incentives for corporate CEOs has now written a book calling for greater control of CEOs and less cronyism on corporate boards .
That cronyism , however , is in part a reflection of Jensen 's earlier conception of the ideal corporation .
I do n't have all the answers on regulatory remedies , but people smarter than I need to systematically ask these questions , even if they are beyond the pale legislatively for now .
And there are scholars of financial markets , former state and federal regulators , economic historians , and even people who did time on Wall Street , who all have the same concerns that I do as well as more technical expertise , and who I am sure would be happy to find company and to serve .
One last parallel : I am chilled , as I ’m sure you are , every time I hear a high public official or a Wall Street eminence utter the reassuring words , " The economic fundamentals are sound . "
Those same words were used by President Hoover and the captains of finance , in the deepening chill of the winter of 1929 - 1930 .
They did n’t restore confidence , or revive the asset bubbles .
The fact is that the economic fundamentals are sound - if you look at the real economy of factories and farms , and internet entrepreneurs , and retailing innovation and scientific research laboratories .
It is the financial economy that is dangerously unsound .
And as every student of economic history knows , depressions , ever since the South Sea bubble , originate in excesses in the financial economy , and go on to ruin the real economy .
It remains to be seen whether we have dodged the bullet for now .
If markets do calm down , and lower interest bail out excesses once again , then we have bought precious time .
The worst thing of all would be to conclude that markets self corrected once again , and let the bubble economy continue to fester .
Congress has a window in which restore prudential regulation , and we should use that window before the next crisis turns out to be a mortal one .
A few months ago I wrote about how finding out your parents financial situation can be stressful and I thought I would touch on that again now that my brother and I have been talking a little more about it .
My mom is living off the savings that her and my dad had amassed before he died , his retirement funds and she will begin to get his SS money in a few years .
But she pays for her medical care herself , and while she is pretty healthy right now , she does have some issues that could cause her some grief later in life .
And in turn , this could cause my brother and I to spend A LOT of money on her care if she needs it after she runs out of her own money .
What else would we do , put her out on the street to fend for herself ?
I do n’t think so .
So we have begun talking about long term care insurance for her , and whether he and I should just pay for it ourselves because she refuses to look into it or get it for herself .
It is a painful conversation to have , but one that needs to be had .
We have tried to bring it up several times , but each time she says she cannot afford it .
However , we cannot afford to pay for her care ourselves if and when she needs it ; after all , we have and will have our own families to take care of .
So long term care kind of looks like a necessity .
Long - term care insurance covers care generally not covered by health insurance , Medicare , or Medicaid .
The expenses laid out for this kind of care are sometimes income tax deductible , so that is good , and the amount deductible depends on the age of the person getting the benefits .
There are generally two types of long term care available :
The Non-Tax Qualified ( NTQ ) was formerly called Traditional Long Term Care insurance .
This type has been sold for over 30 years .
It often includes a “ trigger ” called a “ medical necessity ” trigger .
This means that the patient ’s own doctor , or that doctor in conjunction with someone from the insurance company , can state that the patient needs care for any medical reason and the policy will pay .
Benefits are taxable .
The Tax Qualified ( TQ ) long term care insurance policies do not have a Medical Necessity trigger .
In addition , they require that a person be expected to require care for at least 90 days , and be unable to perform 2 or more activities of daily living ( eating , dressing , bathing , transferring , continence ) without substantial assistance ( hands on or standby ) and that a doctor provides a Plan of Care ; or that for at least 90 days , the person needs substantial assistance due to a severe cognitive impairment and a doctor provides a Plan of Care .
Benefits are non-taxable .
From Guide To Long Term Care
How I understand this is that she would qualify for Non-Tax Qualified care …so I have to do a little digging on the subject .
I am thinking it would be a good investment for my brother and I to make to insure that we are protected later in life and are not wiped out by her medical needs , should they arise .
Anyone out there have any experience with this ?
If so , I would love to hear what you have done or are preparing to do , or if your parents went ahead and bought it for themselves .
For a little more info on the subject , a good place to start is Consumer Law .
It is all so confusing and scary , but I think it needs to be done .

As he was running for president , Al Gore said he'd invented the Internet ; announced that he had personally discovered Love Canal , the most infamous toxic - waste site in the country ; and bragged that he and Tipper had been the sole inspiration for the golden couple in Erich Segal 's best - selling novel Love Story ( made into a hit movie with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal ) .
He also invented the dog , joked David Letterman , and gave mankind fire .
Could such an obviously intelligent man have been so megalomaniacal and self - deluded to have actually said such things ?
Well , that 's what the news media told us , anyway .
And on top of his supposed pomposity and elitism , he was a calculating dork : unable to get dressed in the morning without the advice of a prominent feminist ( Naomi Wolf ) .
Today , by contrast , Gore is " the Goreacle , " the elder statesman of global activism , and something of a media darling .
He is the Bono of the environment , the Cassandra of Iraq , the star of an Oscar - winning film , and a nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize .
To the amusement of his kids , some people now actually consider him cool .
" If you had told me 10 years ago that people were going to be appealing to me for tickets to a hot rock concert through my parents , I would have fallen over , " says his daughter Karenna Gore Schiff , 34 , referring to the Live Earth 24 - hour extravaganza in July .
What happened to Gore ?
The story promoted by much of the media today is that we 're looking at a " new Gore , " who has undergone a radical transformation since 2000 — he is now passionate and honest and devoted to issues he actually cares about .
If only the old Gore could have been the new Gore , the pundits say , history might have been different .
But is it really possible for a person — even a Goreacle — to transform himself so radically ?
There 's no doubt that some things have changed about Al Gore since 2000 .
He has demonstrated inner strength , rising from an excruciating defeat that would have crushed many men .
Beyond that , what has changed is that he now speaks directly to the public ; he has neither the patience nor the need to go through the media .
Eight years ago , in the bastions of the " liberal media " that were supposed to love Gore — The New York Times , The Washington Post , The Boston Globe , CNN — he was variously described as " repellent , " " delusional , " a vote - rigger , a man who " lies like a rug , " " Pinocchio . "
Eric Pooley , who covered him for Time magazine , says , " He brought out the creative - writing student in so many reporters . …
Everybody kind of let loose on the guy . "
How did this happen ?
Was the right - wing attack machine so effective that it overwhelmed all competing messages ?
Was Gore 's communications team outrageously inept ?
Were the liberal elite bending over backward to prove they were n't so liberal ?
Eight years later , journalists , at the prompting of Vanity Fair , are engaging in some self - examination over how they treated Gore .
As for Gore himself , for the first time , in this article , he talks about the 2000 campaign and the effect the press had on him and the election .
( In the interest of full disclosure , I should say that my father , Martin Peretz , was his teacher at Harvard and is an ardent , vocal Gore backer .
I contributed to his campaign in February 1999 .
Before reporting this article , however , I 'd had maybe two passing exchanges with Gore in my life . )
Gore was n't eager to talk about this .
He does n't blame the media for his loss in 2000 .
Yet he does believe that his words were distorted and that certain major reporters and outlets were often unfair .
Namely Oil
Now that we know George Bush and Karl Rove recently spent 45 minutes listening to Norman Podhoretz 's views on Iran ( kill ! kill ! kill ! ) , it 's worthwhile to remember this May 21 , 2004 statement by Podhoretz 's wife , author Midge Decter :
We 're not in the middle east to bring sweetness and light to the whole world .
That 's nonsense .
We 're in the middle east because we and our European friends and our European non-friends depend on something that comes from the middle east , namely oil .
( You can listen to it yourself here at 35:55 .
Decter was appearing on KCRW 's show To the Point . )
Bush gave Podhoretz the nation 's highest civilian award , the Presidential Medal of Freedom , in 2004 .
And he hired Elliot Abrams , Iran - contra criminal and Podhoretz and Decter 's son- in - law , for his National Security Council staff .
( Delightfully , Abrams ' title is " Deputy National Security Adviser for Global Democracy Strategy . "
I understand the position was originally called Deputy National Security Adviser for Sweetness and Light . )
So Bush really digs this family .
How strange that he loves hanging around with a clan whose matriarch he disagrees with so fundamentally .
BONUS : Just before her oil comment , Midge Decter said this about another guest who referred to neoconservatives as " Jacobins " :
I 'm with Bill Kristol here .
You can put a name on it and make it a very unpleasant name .
That 's not the way to conduct an argument .
Yes , there 's nothing neoconservatives hate more than the use of name - calling in political arguments .
It 's their absolute refusal to engage in it themselves that gives them their well - deserved reputation for intellectual integrity .

Great review .
The local GameStop clerk did NOT recommend it to me , as he was told that a Nintendo rep thought the browser sucked .
I did n't buy the browser that day , and now that I read your review I am definitely going to skip on it .
I do n't know why I had doubts about the ' nay ' recommendation from a GameStop clerk ( after all they 're around these things all the time ) , but next time I 'll pay attention to them too .
By , at 4:42 PM
If you do n't want it , can I have it ?
By , at 11:41 PM
Good review !
I 've been wanting to buy it the second I heard about it , but wanted to get more information and reviews .
My main question was if it supports flash and now I know it does n't =(
By , at 5:13 PM
you can disable passwords ...
O_O
By , at 10:38 PM
Indeed , you can .
I figured it out later on .
I still can't believe that you can't save anything , though .
I was n't going to get the Browser because of the lack of multimedia support and I did n't .
My wife brought it home and I began to play with it .
It does a lot more than I had thought that it could .
It is very robust and functional when you take out all the eye candy .
Even though , I am disappointed with the amount of memory used .
So I put it on an R4 and with more memory , 1 gig , the experience is much better and faster .
I am sure that is a version that supports flash yet it wo n't be released until it is known how well this browser does .
By , at 5:45 PM
actually i'm posting this comment on my DS browser as we speak ...... for 1 , you can set it so you do n't have to set a password everytime you browse .... second it was n't meant for extreme gaming ..... it was meant for those who can't get to a computer to check stuff ..... true it suxxx that there is n't an official flash player but there will be soon ( some genious made a flash player ...... however it does n't work with the official browser .......)........ anyways you should 'nt just give up on it ....... get into homebrews and other junk and explore other options ......

The Opera DS web browser was released in North America on June 4 , 2007 .
The browser has been out for a year now in Europe and Asia .
As with any application , some people love it , and others not so much .
As for myself , I could n't wait to get my hands on one .
I could n't think of anything cooler than browsing the internet on this tiny technology wonder .
Without looking , I found a copy of the browser at EB Games .
After having some ice cream at the mall with my son , we drove home to check it out .
Unfortunately , we had a thunderstorm this afternoon and the power went off .
Obviously , without electricity there is no Wi-Fi , and without Wi -Fi there is no internets .
Finally , 30 minutes after , the power came back on and it was time to try it out .
Before doing anything , you must choose a password for the browser -- and you need the password every time you want to use it .
I 'm not sure why Opera decided to put that in .
Sure , for security , but security for what or whom I do n't know .
Perhaps in case you loose the little machine , and you do n't want anyone else to surf on your dime .
Setting up the Wi-Fi connection is very easy : you search for the hot - spot , then type in the WEP key , and you are ready to surf .
( BTW , my neighbor should really turn on WEP on his linksys router . )
Before getting the software , I used to fantasize surfing and reading email on the comfort of my couch -- there is not much difference from using my laptop , as I have to do now , but a geek fantasy is a geek fantasy .
After everything was ready , the first web site I tried was youtube.com .
Unfortunately , the DS Opera browser does n't play well with the Flash player .
Needless to say , it does n't play youtube movies .
It was a bit of a letdown .
I did try to download the most recent Flash player , but that did n't work either ( I did n't think it would work , actually ) .
I googled around to see if flash was indeed available on the DS browser , but I have n't found a definite answer ( apparently , empirical evidence is not good enough for me ; maybe I do n't believe ) .
All I could find was that for the European and Asian version a Flash player is definitely not available , and rumors that the North American version " will " have it .
It does n't .
I tried posting this message with the DS , but blogger does n't work on it .
I get a " disconnecting " error message because of some certificate problem .
The browser says that the certificate is not from the publisher it claims to be .
Does google know this ?
Anyway , I gave up on blogger and tried reading my email on my josesandoval.com server and gmail account .
That worked better .
In fact , it works without a hitch , though the navigation of the two screens is a bit awkward .
It takes some time to get used to , but I am not sure what I was expecting .
I mean , the screen on the DS is really , really small .
So from a user perspective , the browser fails .
Perhaps I want too much from my web browser , or I 'm a really demanding user .
Now , from a technical and software engineering perspective , the application is very good .
The browser was very well designed to take advantage of the dual and touch screen technology .
Moreover , it is very user friendly ( leave aside the size of the screen ) ; the buttons are intuitive ; the set up process is extremely easy ; the sound scheme is pleasing ( I turn it off , but it 's not completely annoying ) ; the color scheme is soft and goes well with the whole Nintendo DS feel .
The HTML rendering engine works quite well , as it displays most HTML heavy sites and handless CSS adequately .
I did notice that it 's every slow to connect to web sites and downloading images -- perhaps it 's a combination of the Wi-Fi card and the CPU .
I 'm not entirely sure it's the CPU , because any of the SuperMario games are very graphic intensive and I have not seen any slow downs -- of course , the machine is optimized to play games and the games are optimized to play in the machine .
Hello !?. The JavaScript engine works fine , to a certain degree .
At least the sites I tried worked fine .
AJAX applications are out of the questions -- none of the ones I tried worked .
So from a user 's point of view , it disappoints .
Maybe I was expecting too much .
I will have to ask Gabriel ( my 7 year old son ) what he thinks about it .
After all , the little machine was intended for his age group .
There are some technical applications that are being published that probably targeted for mom and dad .
If that is the intent , I 'm guilty of falling in their trap : I bought the Nintendo DS Opera browser , and I do n't like it .
Well , as a regular user I do n't like it , but as a software developer I really , really like it -- I wish I had the code .
With a phalanx of cameras awaiting her entrance , Valerie Plame stepped out of the spy - world shadows and into the spotlight .
For nearly four years , Plame had been a silent , Garbo - like figure at the center of one of Washington ’s most consuming scandals .
Her unmasking as a covert CIA officer became a case study of the brutal politics of the Iraq war , and launched a criminal probe that led to the conviction of a top White House official .
On Friday , Plame finally offered her inside account .
She testified before a congressional committee that she felt as if she had been “ hit in the gut ” when her once - secret identity appeared in the media , and accused the Bush administration of “ recklessly ” blowing her cover .
Plame answered lingering questions about her husband ’s role in investigating one of the administration ’s most alarming prewar claims about Iraq , and provided new details on the tense maneuvering between the White House and CIA in the run-up to the war .
Advertisement
But spectacle often trumped specifics .
When Plame , 43 , emerged from a doorway at the corner of the committee chambers , dozens of lenses swung in unison to catch her entrance .
As she sat down to testify , there were twice as many photographers as lawmakers arrayed before her .
And as she got up to leave , she swept her hands back and forth like a Hollywood actress accustomed to clearing her way through paparazzi .
At one point , Rep. Lynn Westmoreland ( R - Ga. ) alluded to the flashbulb atmosphere , as well as the oddity of publicly questioning a woman who spent the bulk of her career hiding her identity .
“ I ’ve never questioned a spy before , ” Westmoreland said .
“ I ’ve never testified under oath before , ” Plame shot back .
Advertisement
In her opening statement , Plame made it clear that she has been waiting for a chance to confront critics .
At one point , she scoffed at the notion that her identity was “ common knowledge on the Georgetown cocktail circuit , ” as some have whispered in Washington .
She said she has been on secret foreign missions within the last five years , and was undercover when her name appeared in a newspaper column in July 2003 .
Plame also came prepared to settle scores with the administration , which carried out a campaign to discredit her husband -- former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV -- after he surfaced as a potent critic of the case for war .
“ We in the CIA always know we might be exposed by foreign enemies , ” Plame said .
“ It was a terrible irony that administration officials were the ones who destroyed my cover . ”
Plame acknowledged sometimes seeking publicity , saying that her appearance in a Hollywood - like photo spread in Vanity Fair in January 2004 “ was more trouble than it was worth . ”
Advertisement
Wilson , who at times has seemed to relish the limelight of the scandal , did not attend Friday ’s hearing .
Plame was accompanied by two former CIA colleagues , who said that Wilson and the couple ’s children were traveling in the Western United States .
Wilson and Plame recently purchased a home in Santa Fe , N.M. , after selling their Washington property for a reported $ 1.8 million .
Wilson , 57 , has published a memoir , and Plame also has written a book , titled “ Fair Game , ” that is undergoing a CIA review to prevent disclosure of classified information .
Friday ’s hearing , held by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , ostensibly was designed to assist lawmakers in drafting improved procedures for safeguarding classified information .
But the unacknowledged purpose was to give a platform to someone who has been a mystery figure in a scandal bearing her name .
Advertisement
Committee Chairman Henry A. Waxman ( D - Los Angeles ) said that the panel had negotiated ground rules for the hearing with the CIA to prevent the disclosure of classified information , including details of Plame ’s background .
As a result , Plame offered only a general outline of her 20 - year career at the agency , saying she was working in the counter - proliferation division -- a branch devoted to tracking the global spread of illicit weapons -- when her identity was exposed .
But for the first time , she offered her version of the chronology leading up to that breach .
Plame said that in early 2002 , she was approached by “ a young junior officer ” who was “ very upset ” after getting a phone call from Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office asking about a report that Iraq had sought to buy uranium from the African nation of Niger .
Plame characterized the call as part of a broader effort by Cheney to pressure the CIA into reaching harder assessments on Iraq -- a charge that Cheney as well as senior CIA officials who were at the agency at the time have denied .
“ Certainly Vice President Cheney ’s unprecedented number of visits to the CIA in the run-up to the war might be one example ” of his efforts to pressure analysts , Plame said .
Advertisement
Asked whether that was a form of intimidation , she said , “ Yes , it is . ”
Administration officials later said Plame had proposed sending her husband to Niger to investigate the uranium claim , casting the trip as a boondoggle .
But Plame insisted that was not the case : “ No .
I did not recommend him , I did not suggest him , there was no nepotism involved . ”
Rather , Plame said , the idea was proposed by another officer in her division .
She said her only role was to ask her husband whether he would be interested .
“ I was somewhat ambivalent at the time , ” Plame said .
“ We had 2 - year - old twins at home , and all I could envision was me by myself at bedtime with a couple of 2 - year - olds . ”
Advertisement
Wilson traveled to Niger and returned to file a report with the CIA that he found no evidence backing up the uranium claim .
The allegation was nevertheless included in President Bush ’s 2003 State of the Union address .
After the U.S. - led invasion , when it became evident that Iraq had no banned weapons , Wilson publicly accused the White House of twisting the prewar intelligence , prompting a White House campaign to discredit him .
Plame said she was at home in bed when she first learned her name had been published in a syndicated column by Robert Novak .
She said her husband threw a copy of the newspaper on the bed and said , “ He did it , ” meaning Novak had printed her name .
“ I felt like I had been hit in the gut , ” she said .
She also said she immediately recognized -- and was subsequently informed by a superior at the agency -- that her clandestine career was over .
Advertisement
Plame was able to testify in part because the criminal investigation of the leak ended last week when I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Cheney ’s former chief of staff , was convicted on four felony counts of lying to investigators .
Neither Libby nor any other government official has been charged with leaking Plame ’s identity .
When asked by the committee about a statement Bush made as the leak investigation was unfolding that he would fire anyone involved with unmasking her , Plame responded : “ Karl Rove clearly was involved in the leaking of my name , and he still carries a security clearance .
I believe it undermines the president ’s word . ”
Rove is Bush ’s chief political advisor .
Even so , Waxman said , CIA Director Michael V. Hayden had informed the committee that at the time Plame ’s identity was exposed , she was an undercover officer and that any disclosure of her agency employment status was prohibited by executive order .
In a measure of the disparity in political enthusiasm over hearing Plame testify , nine of the 11 members who attended the hearings were Democrats .
Advertisement
Westmoreland , one of the two GOP attendees , sought to highlight the partisan backdrop by asking Plame the party to which she and her husband belong .
Plame acknowledged she was a Democrat , and said of Wilson : “ Although my husband comes from a Republican family with deep roots in California , I would say he ’s a Democrat now . ”

The chairman of the AACS Licensing Authority ( AACS LA , for short ) is neither intimidated nor impressed by the Internet " revolt " of sorts that took place earlier this week on sites like Digg .
When the AACS used cease - and - desist letters to encourage scores of Internet sites ( including Google ) to remove an unencrypted HD DVD key , users responded by posting it everywhere .
Now the AACS LA is out there talking tough , and it's as if we have n't seen this scenario played out once already before .
What is it they say about history ?
Those that do n't know it are going to look really clueless when they repeat it ?
Something like that .
AACS , meet DeCSS .
DeCSS , meet your latest imitator .
Such is the lesson that has n't been learned by Michael Ayers , the chairman of the AACS LA .
Ayers told the BBC that the AACS LA will nevertheless use technical and legal means to stop the distribution of the key , apparently ignoring exactly what happens when you attempt to increase your grip on situations like this : keys start flying out everywhere .
And we do mean everywhere : they 're now on t- shirts , one group wrote a song about the key , and I 've had more than a few pictures of new tattoos sent to me ( boy , do I hope those are n't permanent ) .
Ayers ' position on the free speech angle is clear .
" A line is crossed when we start seeing keys being distributed and tools for circumvention .
You step outside of the realm of protected free speech then , " he said .
And Ayers may have the law on his side , at least in the US , as the EFF 's Fred von Lohmann explains clearly .
AACS LA is n't claiming copyright protections for the key .
Rather , the key could constitute a circumvention device , which makes it illegal per the DMCA .
Until a court has ruled , it 's all speculation of course .
Yet even if the law is on his side , Ayers can hope for nothing more than a pyrrhic victory .
His misunderstanding of the situation was made clear in a comment he gave to the EE Times in which he characterizes Digg users as vandals .
" If the local neighborhood gang is throwing rocks at your house , some people might tell you not to call the police because they will just throw bigger rocks , " Ayers said .
But the bigger point is what happens when you " call the police , " to continue with his metaphor .
Yes , the cops can stop people from throwing rocks at your house , so you 've got to take that risk knowing that those same kids might retaliate next week .
But AACS is n't a house , and encryption keys are n't rocks .
Can " the cops " stop a 16 - byte number from existing online ?
We can peer into the future and see the answer because history is , in fact , repeating itself .
Current - generation DVDs are protected by CSS , which is really the father of AACS in so many ways ( except that AACS was supposedly so much more secure ) .
And like father , like son , CSS was cracked , and the code used to do so was spread around the 'net .
When Hollywood came running with lawyers and threats , the code just spread faster .
That was 1999 .
Lawsuits abounded ; lots of money was spent .
It 's now 2007 : guess how many days there were between now and then in which the DeCSS code could n't be easily found online .
If you guessed zero , you 're right !
Such is the effect of " calling the police " in this situation .
The issue becomes that much more noticeable , tensions and emotions start running high , and no solution will be found .
The AACS LA has missed the lesson of DeCSS : the Internet holds no secrets .
While one might sympathize with their predicament , the larger lesson to be learned here is that security based on secrets is truly no more secure than any other form of security .
Once that secret is out , it 's game over .
The more you try to stop that secret from spreading , the more likely it is to spread .
The more coveted that secret is , the worse it gets .
When " DVD Jon " was targeted for his involvement of DeCSS , geeks around the world rallied around him and the idea of DeCSS .
If the AACS is n't careful , they 'll simply make another generation of hero out of a problem they created .
What makes it even more deplorable this time is that it's now 2007 , and the writing is on the wall : DRM is a failed idea , and a waste of time and money .
We recognize that old ass - shift - pocket - reach - downward - stare - thumb - action anywhere , especially since we saw it in exquisite high def .
But was Cheney texting Condi or was he just switching the old girl to silent ?
You be the judge .

I think the goal is a worthwhile one even if the end result does n't quite live
up to the orignal hype .
It is important to remember that this is laptop V 1.0 .
Giving every child / family / village in the world access to the global library of
information would be transformative event .

Here 's < a
href = " http://www.siliconvalleysleuth.com/2006/09/intel_talks_up_.html "
> another video < / a > from intel , less about the software , and more about
kids 's reaction in Nigeria to using them ( must be a early test release of the
laptops ) .
I hope this project has long term staying power , I think the success
depends largely on it's management and continued support by local governments .
Just the access to email and google is one big selling point , in my mind .
Maybe someday we 'll hear from somebody using a OLPC laptop right here !

Poor George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , and Thomas Jefferson .
Their
educations were so weakened by their lack of access to computers .
If only we
could go back in time and give them laptops so they could have developed their
mind more .
Just think about what they could have done .
And oh my , the American public education establishment is loosing 40 % of its
kids to drop - out and the other 60 % are poorly suited to compete in a global
economy .
Why ?
A lack of laptops I 'm sure .
PJ , I think you analysis of law and technology is better than your analogy of
education .
I am a technophile , and very proud of it .
In my home are five computers plus
PDA / phones , and so forth .
I 've been working on computers since I was 7 years old
and am now pursuing a PhD in Computer Science .
I 'm stating this so it is clear
that I do not have a phobia of technology ( for the record , my wife is an
electrical engineer , so neither does she ) .
Furthermore , I have attended Alan Kay 's demonstration of squeak myself .
I know
what its capabilities are and I know how it is being used by students .
My analysis : it helps students who have bad teachers and part - time parents .
After the public schools have driven all creativity and love of learning out of
their little bodies , the Squeak program comes as a welcome relief .
After they
are still having arithmetic shoved down their throats in fourth grade , I 'm sure
that studying acceleration and the pull of gravity using Squeak as a tool must
seem like deliverance .
Ok , my rant is over and I 'm off the soapbox .
I 'm ready for the flame .

Earlier , I posted a call for an open letter to MS .
I think this is still relevant .
Ideally , MS officials should be asked these questions in every interview .
The reference is to the Novell blog .
From the previous article :
" For the people who do n't like the microsoft / novell deal .
Please put your questions and remarks here " I posted the following question at their blog :
The deal between MS and Novel implies that the OLPC project is constructing a laptop which will infringe on MS ' patents .
The OLPC project is NOT covered by the covenant .
This means that millions of children might be denied their laptop after these have been produced and shipped at great cost .
Do n't you feel morally obliged to inform the OLPC project about the patents they infringe ?
Could n't we ( PJ ? ) formulate an open letter to MS where we ask them whether they want to protect their precious IP and tell the OLPC what patents they infringe .
Or whether they just want to use patent threats to crush all competition and deny millions of children in the developing world acces to cheap laptops .
Laptops developed and produced at great cost by NGO 's and poor developing nations .
And then watch how they spin this in the run-up to Xmas Rob ---
Revenge , Justice , Security , and Revenge , chose any two .

I wonder how much the issue of patents really threatens FOSS .
Since the source , including the history of the source , is freely available , it would be interesting to see how many of these " original " patents were actually implemented in FOSS code before the patent was actually filed .

< rant type=ignorable method=hypocaffeinated >
I 've recently taken a little time to look at some of the SW patents .
( Frankly ,
reading them makes me think that the Patent Orifice should charge by the claim ,
whether accepted or not , instead of by the accepted patent . )
If I understand correctly , a patent must not be ' obvious ' to a person ' skilled
in the art ' , but yet the description in a patent 's claims must be sufficient for
that selfsame skilled person to produce the subject of the patent .
It seems that most of the claims in Microsofts patents are so obvious that
anyone who can write a few lines of basic could come up with them - and yet the
description itself is so generic that a programmer with years of experience
still could not implement them from the description .
And this pattern seems to repeat in ALL software patents .
In my mind at least , this should be sufficient to make the it patently invalid .
None that I have seen have included any sort of reference implementation - which
I would consider to be a minimum requirement - or anything as informative as an
RFC to describe the operation .
Of course , if a reference implemtation was provided , then ' spectral analysis '
could have been used to show that there is prior art for ALL of the claims I
saw .
Ah well , </rant >

Actually Squeak is not GPL but covered by the Squeak License .
Squeak was originally developed at Apple and Disney .

Here 's an idea - someone with an interest in GNU / Linux should sue Microsoft
claiming unfair marketing practices surrounding their patent FUD ( is this Lanham
act in the USA ? ) .
Could they be forced to disclose what patents they are
referring to in order to defend themselves against such a claim , or would they
be able to keep these secret from the public ?
The number of redacted documents
in the SCO cases makes me fear the latter , although clearly whoever sues would
be a party to these .
My worry is that of course Microsoft have enough money to
make such a case drag on sufficiently to bleed any company dry should they try
this .
Alternatively , could they be forced by a court to make a declarative statement
of the patent claims they wish to make , in such a way that they forfeit any
rights to anything they do n't declare ?
A kind of " if you ever want to use
it , you must declare it up front " approach .
I seem to remember a legal
precedent was recently set to do with submarine patents , but my memory fails me
as to which it was now .
That 's essentially the threat that Microsoft are
issuing .

I was astonished when Bill Gates criticized the OLPC project .
At the same time , I can't help but think that this way of thinking is a direct result of the Microsoft monoculture .
It is one of Microsoft 's greatest weaknesses , this habit of using Microsoft Everything ; it has been so long since they cared about interoperability , the automatic response is to fit the hardware to the bloated software instead of really innovating .
I have a colleague at work , a senior manager oversseing sales in a part of the world which includes Africa .
He has a favorite saying : " IT projects are too important to be decided by IT people " .
I can't agree 100 % :) but I take his point .
I hope the armchair pundits who loudly opposed the OLPC project will understand that innovation comes from searching for a solution to a problem , rather than worrying about lost potential profits in underdeveloped regions of the world .

M$ wants to sell a luxury product .
It may have people who are willing to
discuss it as a commodity , but the truth is , software has to cost a lot less
than they think they can afford for it to continue the kind of amazing work it
has done .
Plus Gates is a hardware junkie : he wants his fix .
And he assumes
that we all do .
He 's going to play this patent thing for all it is worth .
After all , he 's not going to jail over it is he ?
He 's stepped into the fight against Malaria , and his views have changed ,
substantively .
One can only hope that he sees , eventually , that either this
kind of tool has to get out there , and I mean something more efficient than his
crippled Windoze , or they are just going to have to deal with piracy and
whatever versions of Open Source are out there .
I know .
They 're going to have to deal with whatever versions of Open Source are
out there anyhow .
And that 's a good thing .
But if we 're going to have a
comfortable lifestyle we will have to deal with them on more equitable terms ,
and that means understanding that IP " piracy " is as much a response to
the political control of the flow of information as it is the economic control .
This patent " sabre - rattling " is only helping to create a situation in
many poor parts of the world where real piracy with guns and extortion is
becoming more of an attractive option for people whose governments do n't seem to
care whether they get fed or not .

As others have mentioned , SCO 's non-case has been a net benefit for Linux ; it's
made Linux stronger against legal attacks .
Before , Linux obviously had n't been
vetted .
Now , it has .
And better yet , public perception has been vaccinated
against nebulous accusations of intellectual property infringement .
So , while Microsoft certainly has legal resources , I expect my reaction is
typical : " Where 's the beef ? "
If they have something , present it .
We 've long known that patents are the most
likely legal threat , so it 's not like Microsoft is making any great revelations .
Give us specific allegations .
Linux will respond on the merits .
Until then ,
yawn .
If this is just the FAT32 long names patents again , I 'll be annoyed .

So , Microsoft .
I have a question for you .
What are you doing to match this ?
A deal with Novell .
Following the hurried Becta Report on interoperability ( 4 page pdf ) produced over the Summer in the UK .
This will enable the UK government to allow the install of Novell desktops in the poorer schools in the UK and achieve their desired 100 % Microsoft controlled lockin .
Of course , that plan could be thrown off course by events over the next few months .
I await with interest to witness the possible approval of the first Red Hat / Ubuntu / or other alternate desktop against the wishes of Sir Bill .

You know , I do n't agree with Dvorak on this ( or many other things ) but I really
do n't think he 's acting as a shill for MS here or he would have been championing
that Intel / WinXP knockoff of the OLPC laptop .
I did n't even see this story on
MSN ( which I do n't exactly frequent ) , I saw it on marketwatch.com .
I think this is just another variation of the tired old " why give them
laptops when they really just need some beans and rice " argument .
And it
is dangerous to assume that the laptops will end up in kids ' hands when other
forms of aid end up going to the wrong people or just sitting on docks or in
warehouses .
But the idea that tech people should n't try to help in their own
way just because other people have failed seems like a fallacy to me .

I almost get the idea that he was being sarcastic , or satiric .
Almost .
If not for the fact that Dvorak is , IMHO , full of himself .
At one time , I
purchased PCMagazine regularly , and read every word of his column , particulary
" Inside Track " .
This was way before he got on ZDTV .
I think that
somewhere he lost track of the fact that his job is to * report * on tech , and
began trying to influence it .
But still .... he may have been joking .
I hope he was .

The full hardware docs have / will not been released .
There is no way to replace the installed OS with anything else .
You 'd better hope the OLPC project maintains the code in perpetuity , because
there is no way to maintain it yourself without the docs .

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was ratified by the United Nations in
1948 , but surveys show the vast majority of people have never heard of it .
On the web site there are 30 ads could be shown to people to educate them as to
what there human rights actually are !
Imagine what educating people on these
rights would do !
Access to information like this is one very interesting potential benefit of the

I hope everyone at Microsoft notices from the paragraph how important it is to be inspired by other programmers ' prior work , because that is precisely what is wrong with software patents , among many other things .
They make ideas unusable , and that curtails innovation .
Because there are large parts of the world that currently do not allow software patents , I think you could posit that software patents are endangering the US 's ability to compete , and it will only get worse .
The best way to prepare is to write programs , and to study great programs that other people have written .
In my case , I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and I fished out listings of their operating systems . "
- Bill Gates quoted in Programmers at Work , copyright 1986 by Microsoft Press .
Something else that does n't often get quoted in full ; Back in 1991 Bill Gates was more concerned that some other company would take out a software patent on some obvious technology and use it to hold Microsoft to ransom .
If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today 's ideas were invented , and had taken out patents , the industry would be at a complete standstill today .
I feel certain that some large company will patent some obvious thing related to interface , object orientation , algorithm , application extension or other crucial technique .
If we assume this company has no need of any of our patents then the have a 17 - year right to take as much of our profits as they want .
The solution to this is patent exchanges with large companies and patenting as much as we can .

The discussion of the effects of OLPC are likely to be mostly of a kind I
have n't seen discussed anywhere .
If it is at all successful in its educational
goals , OLPC will have a profoundly disruptive effect on the cultures of the
people whose children use it .
Among other things :
- it will greatly reduce the authority of parents / elders who are not familiar
with this new source of knowledge .
- it will open masses of kids to people peddling all sorts of ideas , some good
and some evil .
Note that many of these kids will not have had the kind of
training in detecting lies / spin that Western kids have from watching TV ( eg
from getting an advertised toy and seeing the difference between ad and
reality )
- it will make it clear to these kids and their elders just how little they
have
materially .
In other words , major culture shock , comparable in kind to the effects on a
isolated hunter / gatherer culture when it comes into contact with the modern
world , or to the effects the European invasion of North America has had on
the native cultures , but involving millions of people .
The effects will be
tremendous , many for the good but potentially also very bad .
I do n't think
anyone can confidently predict what this project will cause .

I think taxing Linux is on topic :P
FEAR
UNCERTAINTY
DOUBT
Dan & David Show
OMG this is so slanted and full of FUD
http://chkpt.zdnet.com/chkpt/zd.pod/http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/z/e/200611/11-1
7-06_dananddavidshow.mp3
http://blogs.zdnet.com/btl/?p=3980
Here is a rough transcript :
6:20
# Dan : I guess the big story of the week was this on going Novell ms agreement
that has turned into paying a tax to ms for running Linux .
# David : Hah , what Redhat is calling an innovation tax .
So Steve Ballmer at a
sever conference in Seattle
he took the rhetoric up a couple of notches , in terms of whether or not ms may
come knocking on the door of either , distributors of Linux beyond Novell , such
as Redhat or users of Linux themselves .
And he made it clear that both , what I
mean by both is , users of Linux and other distributors have perhaps * a liability
on their balance sheet that need to be dealt with * and he also made it really
clear that he was going to look for deals with other distributors , that the deal
he made with Novell is not exclusive .
So the basic indication there is that ms
believes that is has or very clearly believes that it has Intellectual Property
that is being * misappropriated * in Linux
# David :
What specifically is it that 's being misappropriated has that been
declared yet ?
# Dan :
Well you know , its hard to say , he was n't really clear , he wasnt specific
about what in Linux could be infringing upon MS's Intellectual Property he
mentioned the word Linux
# David : Guy : Does he mean kernel ?
# Dan :
Well its hard to say you know technically speaking the word Linux refers
to the kernel , and to refer to the entire package thats typically distributed
around the world , you know , by the different companies and distributors , that
has all of these other pieces of software around it is GNU / Linux .
And so if you
ahhh , you know depending
on who ever you are talking to , if somebody says Linux it means the Kernel
somebody else , a lot of people drop the GNU and just call the whole thing Linux .
I do n't know what Steve Ballmer 's style is there so its hard to tell whether he
is referring to the Kernel or not .
Now what else beyond the Kernel could be something that is infringing upon MS's
Intellectual Property rights , well ahh , one of the speculations has been , ahh
around samba .
samba is the software that comes with most distributions of Linux
that , amongst other things allows a Linux box to pretend that it a MS based
file and print server , ahh , it runs the SMB protocol , which is a protocol
associated with MS 's file and print server 's , has been for a very long time ,
dating back to lan manager .
ahhm but some scuttle but thats going around the net
that says that er perhaps ahhm , when IBM , released 500 patents under a big
patent covenant to the open source community that it covered samba 's butt .
When
it did that so , maybe there 's prior art in IBM's Intellectual Property
portfolio .
That er would prevent anybody who is using samba from getting sued by
MS .
What else ?
Open Office is another one .
You know maybe open office which is also
distributed with most copies of Linux .
Maybe that infringes upon some of MS's
Intellectual Property and MS Office .
But a lot of people believe that MS starts lowering the boom on anybody who may
be potentialy infringing on MS Office Intellectual Property the European Union
will go nuts because there are so may users over there .
And the EU is all ready
coming after MS .
# Dan :
So why does MS want to take this point when it seemed that the company was
becoming more friendly to open source ?
# David :
You know its an IP based economy Dan .
I mean at the end of the day .
Ahh
MS 's entire business model , is based on it abillity to protect its Intellectual
Property .
Om and as is many other companies and so ah , say what you will about
what it takes , you know the ability to get patents and stuff like this in the
the US now .
We 're not just talking about patents here we could be talking about
copyrights .
We still do n't know exactly but ah , its an an IP based economy .
Thats what , thats what , you know , makes doing business here great .
And ahh , MS's
not ready to move to the other models that , lets say , Redhat 's pursuing , or lets
say SUN the one , you know , the way SUN is transitioning .
MS is clearly not a hardware company outside of a few products like Zune &
some mice & keyboards .
So ah , you know they have to to protect its
Intellectual Property I dont think they have a choice .

Doctors should have the right to remove a person 's organs after death unless they have explicitly asked for them not to be taken , Britain 's top medical adviser willl recommend this week .
Sir Liam Donaldson is expected to call for the law to be changed to introduce a system of organ donation that presumes consent .
It is thought that the change from the current system , which relies on people stating they wish to be donors , will free up hundreds of hearts , kidneys , livers and other organs for transplant each year .
Currently just a quarter of the population are members of the organ donor register - and around 400 people die a year while waiting for a transplant .
However , while such a change would save lives , it would prove controversial , with critics questioning the need to give the state new powers over people 's bodies .
Sir Liam , Britain 's chief medical officer , is expected to call for the system to be changed when he publishes his annual report on the nation 's health .
A change to an opt - out system already has the support of the British Medical Association .
A recent BMA report states : ' Each year , many people die waiting for organ transplant .
' At the same time , bodies are buried or cremated complete with organs that could have been used to save lives , not because the deceased objected to organ donation but simply because they never got round to signing up to the NHS Organ Donor Register or informing their relatives of their wishes . '
The BMA favours a ' soft ' opt - out system , under which family members would still have the right to veto donation .
Similar systems already operate in Spain and in Belgium , where the number of organs available has almost doubled .
However , such as system is not a universal success , with Sweden having a lower rate of donated organs than the UK , despite having an opt - out law .
Just 14.4 million
Britons are registered as donors , however studies suggest that up to 60 per cent support a move to presumed consent .
Dr Vivian Nathanson , the BMA 's head of science and ethics believes Britons are becoming ready to accept such a system .
She said : ' We are now getting close to a system of presumed consent .
We have exhausted all other ways of increasing the number of organs available but people are still dying on the waiting list and that is making us more courageous . '
A spokesman for UK Transplant , which runs the organ donor register , said : ' We welcome any debate that raises the value and importance of transplantation and increases the general public 's knowledge of the importance of organ and tissue donation . '
A perfect term paper needs a proper format , but if we do n’t know a single aspect of the term paper , then it a stressful point to do .
While writing a term paper , you need to do proper research by spending a few hours .
All the things are required like time , planning , writing skills , and some others .
Through this , you need to check some term paper examples which give you some ideas about writing .
Before writing an actual term paper , you need to know the exact definition of term paper .
What is term paper ?
According to Google , the actual meaning of term paper is to make a research on the topic which authorized by the students for increasing the academic grades .
Writing the term paper is beneficial for everyone because it increases the writing skills and enhances knowledge .
When you are making research on a particular topic , then you will find a different perspective of a specific thing .
Process of writing a term paper
You can write a term paper with yourself by knowing the method .
Through the process , there is no need to worry .
Select the topic
Research the topic systematically
Prepare the outline of the term paper
Write your sample proposal
Start writing
Prepare the cover page
Read the content , edit and make the final copy
Term paper outline
If you will know the process , it is not essential that you can write anything .
The draft of term paper is that aspect which frames your thoughts in a proper format .
The outline of the term paper is used as a direction .
An overview should be made for the benefits of the writer to help them to stay on the right track .
The term paper outline is given below :
Introduction :
It is the starting part of an essay .
The primary purpose of the presentation is to write thesis statements .
It is used to make an alert to the reader about what is going to be done next .
Body : Main part of the application essay help which is divided into various headings and subheadings .
These heading must be linked with the topic .
Conclusion : Summary of the article , which represents the result of the observation .
Thus , these are some aspects which you need to consider while writing a term paper .
The process and outline are two main aspects which help you in framing a proper term paper .
Would you like to add or edit content here ?
Here 's how you can have an account !
From FreeThoughtPedia
Confusing cause and effect is one of the most common logical fallacies .
It 's a principal component of most propaganda .
It 's also known as the correlation / causation error , Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc or the false cause fallacy .
False Cause
This fallacy states :
If X happens and Y occurs , you can conclude that X is the cause of Y .
My knee aches just before it rains , therefore the ache in my knee is the cause of the rain .
It is consistent , repeatable , and accurate therefore it must be true .
Causal fallacies occur because of scientific ignorance ( although in many cases , the fallacy is intentionally misleading ) .
The assumption is that two correlated phenomena have a causal relationship .
This fallacy occurs when we assume that because two things have either a positive relationship ( the more it rains , the more your knee aches ) or a negative relationship ( The more you watch tv , the less you exercise ) that this means that one thing is the CAUSE of the other .
This is not necessarily true , for while correlation is a necessary condition for causality , it is not a sufficient reason for a causality .
Here are some more examples :
Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani prominently featured one such myth in his speech Oct. 20 to a group of social conservatives .
The former New York City mayor stated that " we increased adoption by 133 % over the eight years before I came into office .
And we found that abortions went down by 18 % during that period of time .
I believe we can do that in the United States . "
But Giuliani's implied causality between these two statistics is unsupportable for this simple reason :
The increases he cites were in the rate of adoptions of children out of New York City 's foster care system , not in the rate at which women were continuing unwanted pregnancies and placing their infants for adoption rather than having abortions .
Nothing in the data he cites indicates that there was any significant increase in the city 's newborn relinquishment rate while he was mayor .
Rudy Giuliani is veritable fountain of causal logical fallacies .
Here 's another one :
" My chance of surviving prostate cancer , and thank God I was cured of it , in the United States , 82 % , " Rudy says .
" My chances of surviving prostate cancer in England , only 44 % under socialized medicine .
You and I should be making the decisions about what kind of health care we get with our doctors , not with a government bureaucrat . "
Here , Giuliani implies there 's a direct causal relationship between the prostate cancer survival rate and socialized medicine .
Ridiculous .
To add further insult to injury , the statistics Giuliani cited are patently false .
In the spirit of Giuliani - logic , I 'd like to present my own creative interpretation of cause and effect : Rudi Giuliani was mayor of New York City on 9/11/2001 .
The World Trade Center was attacked on 9/11/2001 .
If Rudi Giuliani had not been the mayor of New York city , it would not have been attacked .
Is n't it time you re-thought what was Giuliani 's real role in the terrorist attacks ?
More examples :
Mao Tse Tung and Josef Stalin were atheist , therefore all atheists are immoral , genocidal dictators .
Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin wore mustaches , therefore all people who wear mustaches are immoral , genocidal dictators .
Slippery Slope
Another popularly known fallacy , this is actually an offshoot of the false cause fallacy .
It occurs when an arguer claims one event must lead to a successive chain of less desirable consequences - without offering any other proof .
Example : " If we vote for Clinton , a known pot smoker , soon the whole Whitehouse will be filled with drug addicts . "
" Because if we make the wrong choice , then the danger is that we 'll get hit again , that we 'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States , and that we 'll fall back into the pre-9/11 mind set if you will , that in fact these terrorist attacks are just criminal acts , and that we 're not really at war .
I think that would be a terrible mistake for us . "
- Vice President Dick Cheney , speaking about the choice Americans would soon make in the presidential election at a Des Moines , Iowa campaign appearance on September 7 , 2004
Just like they morphed Osama Bin Ladin into Saddam Hussein in 2002 , neocons morph Al Qaeda into Iran today , with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the new Saddam Hussein who we must be trained to fear .
And it is working .
They are making significant steady progress in alarming the general public about Iran .
They act like slippery weasels and say " True , Iraq was never a grave threat , but Iran actually was , and now the Iranian threat is getting greater all the time .
It does n't matter if you think attacking Iraq was a mistake , because Iran is the real deal , and now we finally must face up to something we should have dealt with a long time ago "
Republican Neocons , and some of their hawkish Democratic allies , not only believe that war with Iran is inevitable AND in the long term interests of the United States , they believe that the sooner we get it on the better .
To them , military and political circumstances are as favorable now as they are likely to get , with a sitting Republican President who is predisposed to use force .
Neocons see history moving against American interests if the U.S. does not act boldly to rearrange the Middle Eastern map , locking in " our " Oil Supplies now before the further rise of China handcuffs America ’s ability to act .
On top of their long standing desire to take Iran 's government down , Republicans have another compelling motivation to shift the public ’s attention onto " the threat posed by Iran " .
They need a threat from Iran to once again pump up national security hysteria to once again prop up the G.O.P .
They increasingly can't point to " fighting the terrorists in Iraq so we do n't have to fight them here " , because the public sees fully the futility of our efforts to fight terrorists inside Iraq .
The public knows that it was our invasion which created terrorists in Iraq , and that the U.S. is incapable of restoring order to Iraq now by sending in more American troops .
So now is the perfect time to shift the focus onto Iran , which neocons conveniently blame for our failure in Iraq , and where they claim we will not have to send American troops in to protect America ’s security , just bombs .
They skillfully play on the frustration American 's feel watching our supposed Arab allies in Iraq 's government , who seem to act like they hate each other as much as they hate us .
Their covert message goes like this : " Would n't it just feel better to bomb the hell out of Islamic fanatics rather than climb into fox holes with them , where they will only stab us in the back ?
Who cares if Iranians call themselves Persians instead of Arabs , or that Iran is Shiite while Al Qaeda is Sunni ?
They ’re all just crazy rag heads " .
The anti-Arab hate message fueled by images of Bin Ladin , that drummed us steadily into Iraq , now is aimed at Iran , and Democrats by and large sit by passively , allowing it to go unchallenged .
And with our own peace movement completely fixated on ending the war in Iraq , we seem to have scant attention free ourselves to directly confront the chicken hawks on Iran .
So we find ourselves three moves behind them on the domestic political chess board , as their construction of the public psychological framework needed to facilitate an attack on Iran nears completion .
We spend so much time talking to ourselves that we do n’t always hear what others might be saying to each other .
We see the American public coming around to our own views on Iraq , and unconsciously assume they must view the larger question of further conflicts in the Middle East the same as we do also .
Simply put , they do not .
If the public were solidly opposed to ratcheting up tensions with Iran , if they were aghast at the thought of America attacking yet another Middle Eastern nation , do you think that the House Democratic Caucus would have , with little fanfare , stripped out a proposed amendment from their original Iraq war funding legislation ( the bill Bush later vetoed ) that would have forced George W. Bush to come to Congress for a vote prior to an attack on Iran ?
Democrats retained plenty of provisions they knew full well that Bush would veto , but they removed the Iran provision themselves out of a concern expressed by some that they should n’t tie the hands of the President regarding Iran .
It ’s the dynamics of the IWR vote repeated , but since we are giving George Bush free reign against Iran this time , that somehow makes it acceptable .
And unfortunately in the minds of too many Democrats as well as Republicans , that does in fact make it acceptable .
Does anyone doubt the existence of a Pro Iranian War propaganda machine ?
Like all such efforts this one has separate above ground and underground paths of propagation .
So some Americans on Sunday tuned into respected mainstream media news program " Meet The Press " to hear veteran United States Senator Joseph Lieberman say in somber tone :
" I think we 've got to be prepared to take aggressive military action against the Iranians to stop them from killing Americans in Iraq .
And to me that would include a strike over the border into Iran , where we have good evidence that they have a base at which they are training these people to kill our soldiers . "
Meanwhile an unadulterated no holds barred version of the bomb Iran back into the Stone Age message gets circulated through a web site like " Family Security Matters : The National Security Recourse for American Families " , which on June 7th 2007 posted an " exclusive " ; Iran Wants War .
They will have it whether we want it or not .
http://www.familysecuritymatters.org...
That nifty piece of reporting is laden with sober irrefutable " facts " such as these :
" Almost every day we see news reports of al Qaeda bombing attacks in Iraq .
So why do Democrats still keep calling it a " civil war " ?
Al Qaeda terrorists are not Iraqis fighting a " civil war . "
It has been reported that Iran is responsible for 80 % of American deaths in Iraq , either by Iranian fighters , or by Iranian weapons and bombs provided to insurgents and al Qaeda .
Neither the American government nor the press is exploiting Iran ’s responsibility for these deadly attacks , which are Iranian acts of war against America and must be considered as such .
This alone should provide justification for an attack on Iran . "
Ah , but that was the milder part of their commentary .
Before anyone has time to get week kneed about their call for war , the commentary lays out what surely they believe is a compelling justification , including this :
" We must send a message to the rest of the Islamic world that Mecca and Medina are next if the terrorism does n't stop now .
The alternative is a long and dirty war that will last for decades .
Is that what we want to live with when we have the ability to avoid it ?
Utter devastation worked with Japan and Germany .
It will work with Islam .
All we need is the courage and the will to stand up and again be the strong country that we once were .
We did n't get to where we are today by bowing to the will of weak foreign powers and worrying about what they think of us .
The time has come to stand up , America !
The only thing Islam respects is brutality and overwhelming force .
It 's how they 've lived for over a thousand years .
That is why Saddam Hussein and other Islamic dictators were successful for so many years .
Islamic despots know what it takes to bring Middle Eastern Islamists under control .
Islamists have no respect for , or understanding of , western diplomacy and a desire for peaceful solutions .
Their religion forbids compromise with the West .
For them , and now for us as well , it 's either kill or be killed .
If we do n't start playing by their rules , we 're going to lose big .
We cannot win this war with Western morality as the overarching factor .
The first priority must be winning .
Everything else is secondary . "
To dismiss the above simply as talk from and to wing nuts misses an essential element of how political discourse is shaped ; framing the debate .
The more comments like the above are widely disseminated , the less shocking a slightly softer version of those sentiments become .
The more extreme the boundaries of debate get pushed , the more reasonable and sensible comments such as those made by Joe Lieberman on " Meet The Press " start sounding .
And what do most Democrats say in turn , to define their stance to broaden the spectrum of public debate on Iran ?
" Iran is a threat but we should be willing to talk to them , while keeping all options on the table . "
Does that sound like a fair and balanced debate to you , with the full range of views and perspectives well and equally represented ?
Or does it more resemble the programming on a certain well known cable news network ?
Again , I say ; we are losing the fight over Iran .
The only force I see consistently and effectively weighing in to engage the public from a countervailing view point is StopIranar.com sponsored by General Wesley Clark and VoteVets.org .
They need our help .
We ca n’t afford for them to fail .
“ The incident rate for Blackwater is higher , there is a distinction , ” said a senior American government official who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss a delicate , continuing investigation .
“ The real question that is open for discussion is why . ”
Image Erik Prince , the founder of Blackwater USA , in June at a panel discussion on security issues in Cary , N.C. Credit ...
Sara D. Davis / Associated Press
A Blackwater spokeswoman declined to comment .
Blackwater , based in North Carolina , has gained a reputation among Iraqis and even among American military personnel serving in Iraq as a company that flaunts an aggressive , quick - draw image that leads its security personnel to take excessively violent actions to protect the people they are paid to guard .
After the latest shooting , the Iraqi government demanded that the company be banned from operating in the country .
“ You can find any number of people , particularly in uniform , who will tell you that they do see Blackwater as a company that promotes a much more aggressive response to things than other main contractors do , ” a senior American official said .
Today , Blackwater operates in the most violent parts of Iraq and guards the most prominent American diplomats , which some American government officials say explains why it is involved in more shootings than its competitors .
The shootings included in the reports include all cases in which weapons are fired , including those meant as warning shots .
Others add that Blackwater ’s aggressive posture in guarding diplomats reflects the wishes of its client , the State Department ’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security .
Still , other government officials say that Blackwater ’s corporate culture seems to encourage excessive behavior .
“ Is it the operating environment or something specific about Blackwater ? ” asked one government official .
“ My best guess is that it is both . ”
Blackwater was founded in 1997 by Erik Prince , a former member of the Navy Seals , and is privately owned .
Most of its nearly 1,000 people in Iraq are independent contractors , rather than employees of the company , according to a spokeswoman , Anne Tyrrell .
Blackwater has a total of about 550 full - time employees , the she said .
Its diplomatic security contract with the State Department is now the company ’s largest , Ms. Tyrrell said , while declining to provide the dollar amount .
The company also provides security for the State Department in Afghanistan , where it also has counternarcotics - related contracts .
The Nine Network has lost its bid to retain control over how and when people consume its television shows in a landmark court judgment today .
In a David and Goliath battle played out before the Federal Court , Nine alleged Sydney - based IceTV 's electronic program guide ( EPG ) - an online TV guide subscribers can use to schedule television recordings from their computer , personal video recorder or mobile phone - breached its copyright .
Nine claimed IceTV 's guide was too similar to its own , but it is widely held that a a key concern was the potential for IceTV users to skip through advertisements in recorded shows .
HE'S powerful .
He 's conservative .
His daddy was an oil man .
He found God and stopped drinking in middle age .
The certainty and simplicity of his world view infuriate his many opponents .
George Bush ?
No .
The autobiography that is making the American left wobble with rage this week is by Justice Clarence Thomas , the only black member of the Supreme Court .
Mr Thomas was paid $ 1.5 m for a memoir that stops dead the moment he joined the court in 1991 .
About his 16 years working there , he is silent .
Perhaps he is planning a second volume .
In the meantime , his account of the first 43 years of his life is absorbing and sometimes moving .
Mr Thomas was born in penury and grew up with bare feet and intestinal worms .
The man he called “ Daddy ” was in fact his grandfather ( his real father having abandoned him ) who was an oil man in the sense that he delivered the stuff in a truck .
He could barely read but lived a life of rigid self - discipline , and tried to instil the same values in his grandsons .
When Clarence and his brother Myers arrived , lugging a single grocery bag of possessions each , their grandfather said : “ The damn vacation is over . ”
Clarence thought of the filthy outdoor lavatory he had shared with several other families in a slum in Savannah , and wondered which vacation he meant .
Daddy made them work , work , work , at school and in the fields : planting beans , dodging snakes disturbed by the plough , skinning racoons and cleaning fish beneath a light that seemed to draw every insect in south - east Georgia .
Daddy taught his grandson self - reliance .
Though he found his grandfather 's love too tough at the time , he describes him as “ the greatest man I have ever known . ”
His memoir is called “ My Grandfather 's Son ” .
Racially , Mr Thomas began with two handicaps .
Not only was he a black boy in the segregated South ; he was part of an isolated Creole - speaking community , the Geechees ( or Gullahs ) , dismissed as yokels by other blacks .
He pulled himself up by raw intellect and study , with the encouragement of stern nuns .
He trained to become a priest , but dropped out when a classmate exulted in the murder of Martin Luther King .
“ Had the Church been as adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now , ” he writes , his life might have taken a different path .
His grandfather wept when he quit the seminary , and threw him out of the house .
( They were later reconciled . )
None of these revelations will win Mr Thomas much sympathy .
His critics on the left made up their minds long ago .
That he is the most conservative judge on the Supreme Court is bad enough .
That he is black compounds the offence .
His roots are poor , goes the chorus , but he always sides with the rich .
His family has suffered from harsh sentencing — he has adopted a great - nephew whose father was jailed for decades for selling crack — yet he fails to strike down such laws .
He got into Yale because of racial preferences , but now wants to abolish them .
Possibly no other black American is so widely loathed by his own .
“ Uncle Thomas is a traitor ” , read the placards that greet him when he speaks .
Al Sharpton has picketed his home .
Ebony magazine spitefully omits him from its list of the 150 most influential black Americans .
A rapper raps : “ The white man ai n't the devil I promise / You want to see the devil take a look at Clarence Thomas . ”
Mr Thomas is used to brickbats .
At his confirmation hearings , Anita Hill , a former employee , accused him of having sexually harassed her several years before .
She said he described to her scenes from porn films .
He denied it all , and accused Senate Democrats of carrying out “ a high - tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves . ”
He was confirmed by the slimmest of margins .
Both he and Ms Hill stand by their stories .
No one else knows which of them committed perjury .
Television coverage of Mr Thomas 's book has focused like a cheap stage - light on this episode , though Mr Thomas has little new to say about it , save that he is still angry .
Critics and counter - criticism
But just as Bill Clinton 's presidency was about more than stained dresses , so Mr Thomas 's story is about more than Long Dong Silver .
There are two substantive criticisms of him .
One is that he is not clever enough to sit on the Supreme Court .
He seldom speaks during public hearings , and his doubters whisper that he blindly follows Justice Antonin Scalia .
But another recent book , Jan Crawford Greenburg 's excellent “ Supreme Conflict ” , reveals that behind closed doors he is apparently cogent and forceful .
A dissent he wrote for his third case on the court prompted both Mr Scalia and the then chief justice , William Rehnquist , to change their minds .
The second carp about Mr Thomas is that he is cruel .
Rather than seeking justice , he coldly applies the law as it is written .
To conservatives , that is his chief virtue .
Judges who conjure up rights that are not mentioned in the constitution — such as the right to an abortion created by Roe v Wade in 1973 — undermine the rule of law .
He rules in favour of the rich if , and only if , that is what the constitution requires .
He rules against racial preferences because he thinks the equal protection clause means what it says .
Mr Thomas would reverse not only Roe v Wade but also any ruling he deems ungrounded in the constitution 's text .
That puts him in a minority of one on the nine - strong bench ; all the other justices like to pay at least some heed to precedent .
But he does not care .
It is up to lawmakers to make laws , he reckons .
If the voters do n't want change , politicians should persuade them , not just keep their heads down and hope that unelected judges will make the hard choices for them .
His message to politicians echoes the simple homilies his grandfather taught him .
Do your job .
Take responsibility .
No wonder he is so unpopular .
But the court would be poorer without him .

BBC science correspondent
The instruments would be fired from orbit
The " penetrators " would yield new information about the rocky interior .
The venture has been considered by Britain 's astronomy funding agency , PParc , and has been presented to European partners .
The concept is the work of a consortium of space interests , including Surrey Satellite Technology Limited ( SSTL ) .
SSTL 's founder and chief executive , Professor Sir Martin Sweeting , says the costs of space exploration have fallen sufficiently for the UK to think about leading such a mission , which could be at the Moon by 2010 .
Inside the Moon
The consortium proposed two lunar options .
There have been 12 astronauts on the Moon and more than 40 unmanned probes and yet we know surprisingly little about our nearest neighbour
Dr Andrew Coates , Mullard Space Science Lab
They would hit the ground at a high velocity ( 300 m / s ) and penetrate to a depth of 2 m ( 6ft ) .
The darts could carry a small suite of instruments , such as seismometers to listen for " Moonquakes " .
Analysing these tremors would give scientists new insight into the make - up of the lunar interior .
According to Dr Andrew Coates , of the Mullard Space Science Lab and who has contributed to the concept study , the impactors would represent the first time there had been a detailed study of the Moon 's sub-surface .
Moonraker would attempt to land on the lunar surface
" Previous missions have focussed on the side of the Moon that faces the Earth .
Our plan with Moonlite is for the first time is to explore the mysterious far side of the Moon as well . "
As well as Moonlite , the consortium proposed another mission called Moonraker .
This is designed to land on the lunar surface .
Its scientific goal would be to study the lunar surface , perhaps at the poles or in the giant impact crater that resides on the far side of the Moon .
It might also provide useful information for space agencies searching for suitable sites for eventual human habitation .
Economic gain
Britain 's involvement in space has been as a partner in co-operation with Nasa and the European Space Agency ( Esa ) ; and that is unlikely to change .
But Sir Martin feels the time is now right for the UK to try to push its ideas to the fore ; it should try to lead these types of missions .
" For the first time , it 's now affordable , " he told BBC News .
" Current small missions to the Moon cost about 500 million euros .
With advances in small satellites , we could probably cut that cost . "
The missions would give UK scientists more opportunities to study the Moon ; but , Sir Martin believes , they also present British industry with an incredible opportunity .
The Americans intend to set up a lunar colony ; and the European , Indian and Chinese space agencies all have designs on the Moon .
Sir Martin thinks a UK - led " Moonshot " could provide the focus for British space companies to develop support technologies for what is rapidly turning into a 21st - Century space race .
" In the UK , we have tremendous expertise in this area .
A UK Moon programme would enable us to get a foothold in what could turn out to be an economically important area for a relatively low cost , " he argued .
Sir Martin thinks such a programme should be funded by industry and government .
He says that with sufficient support , a British conceived probe could be at the Moon by the decade 's end .

A Real - World Use of Lift
Well , lift is actually being used in production .
I converted a Rails app to lift and it was a very interesting experience ...
Then we did some benchmarking .
For single request processing , the lift code , running inside Tomcat , ran 4 times faster than the Rails code running inside Mongrel .
However , the CPU utilization was less than 5 % in the lift version , where it was 100 % of 1 CPU ( on a dual core machine ) for the Rails version .
For multiple simultaneous requests being made from multiple machines , we 're seeing better than 20 x performance of the lift code versus the Rails code with 5 Mongrel instances .
Once again , the lift code is not using very much CPU and the Rails code is pegging both CPUs .
In terms of new features , we 've been able to add new features to the lift code with fewer defects than with the Rails code .
Our Rails code had 70 % code coverage .
We discovered that anything shy of 95 % code coverage with Rails means that type - os turn into runtime failures .
We do not have any code coverage metrics for the lift code , but we have seen only 1 defect that 's been checked in in the 2 weeks since we started using lift ( vs. an average of 1 defect per checkin with the Rails code . )
So , yes , I 'm pimping my own framework , and yes , I 'm able to do with lift what guys like DHH are able to do with Rails , so the comparison is , in some ways , unfair .
On the other hand , Scala and lift code can be as brief and expressive as Ruby code .
lift offers developers amazing productivity gains vs. traditional Java web frameworks , just as Rails does .
On the other hand , lift code scales much better than Rails code .
lift code is type - safe and the compiler becomes your friend ( this does not mean you should not write tests , but it means that your tests can focus on the algorithm rather than making sure there are no type - os in variable and method names . )
WHEN I FIRST arrived at the Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse in Harrisburg , Pa. , for what was billed as the second coming of the Scopes “ monkey trial , ” a man mingling with the media gaggle handed me an invitation to a lecture titled “ Why Evolution Is Stupid . ”
The fellow advised me to come hear the truth about Charles Darwin ’s dangerous idea .
Then he jerked a thumb toward the courtroom and said , “ You ’re sure not going to hear it in there . ”
I had gone to Harrisburg just over a year ago to research a book , expecting cutting - edge arguments for the theory of evolution pitted against an upstart movement called “ intelligent design , ” which claims there is evidence of a master designer inside living cells .
And hear them I did , in frequently riveting ( and occasionally stupefying ) detail , as the judge considered whether teaching intelligent design in public schools breached the wall separating church and state .
And yet that invitation and the angry , volatile town meeting it led me to that week proved even more enlightening .
It showed me an essential truth of this nation ’s culture wars that seems especially relevant today , Darwin ’s 198th birthday :
There are really two theories of evolution .
There is the genuine scientific theory , and there is the talk - radio pretend version , designed not to enlighten but to deceive and enrage .
The talk - radio version had a packed town hall up in arms at the “ Why Evolution Is Stupid ” lecture .
In this version of the theory , scientists supposedly believe that all life is accidental , a random crash of molecules that magically produced flowers , horses and humans -- a scenario as unlikely as a tornado in a junkyard assembling a 747 .
Humans come from monkeys in this theory , just popping into existence one day .
The evidence against Darwin is overwhelming , the purveyors of talk - radio evolution rail , yet scientists embrace his ideas because they want to promote atheism .
Advertisement
These are just a few highlights of the awful and pervasive straw - man image of evolution that pundits harp about in books and editorials and , yes , on talk radio , and this cartoon version really is stupid .
No wonder most Americans reject evolution in poll after poll .
But then there is the real theory of evolution , the one that was on display in that Harrisburg courtroom , for which there is overwhelming evidence in labs , fossils , computer simulations and DNA studies .
Most Americans have not heard of it .
Teachers give it short shrift in schools because the subject upsets too many parents who only know the talk - radio version .
But real evolution is n’t random ; it does n’t say man came from monkeys .
Those claims are made up by critics to get people riled up -- paving the way for pleasing alternatives like intelligent design .
Real evolutionary theory explains how life forms change across generations by passing on helpful traits to their offspring ; a process that , after millions of years , gradually transforms one species into another .
This does not happen randomly but through nature ’s tendency to reward the most successful organisms and to kill the rest .
This is why germs grow resistant to antibiotics and why some turtles are sea animals and others survive quite nicely in the desert , and why dinosaurs -- and more than 99 % of all other species that have ever lived on Earth -- are extinct .
The environment changes .
The recipe for survival changes with it .
And life changes to keep up -- or it dies .
Darwin ’s signature insight is both brilliant and elegantly , brutally simple .
Advertisement
The real theory of evolution does not try to explain how life originated -- that remains a mystery .
The truth is that many scientists accept evolution and believe in God -- and in a natural world so complete that it strives toward perfection all on its own , without need of a supernatural designer to keep it going .
The judge in Pennsylvania eventually found that real evolution was not stupid ; that intelligent design was religion , not science , and that the school board in Dover , Pa. , whose actions had precipitated this replay of Scopes , was out of line .
Judge John E. Jones III was rewarded for his sensible and well - documented ruling with death threats .
Such is the power of talk - radio evolution .
Meanwhile , a creationist history of the Grand Canyon is on sale in national park shops .
A major American museum expressed interest in having me speak about my new book but decided the subject of evolution was too “ political ” right now to risk it .
And teachers across the nation tell me they feel compelled to downplay or skip evolution lessons to avoid controversy ; one L.A. - area high school instructor said she is the only one of five science teachers on her faculty to even mention evolution in class , notwithstanding a clear state mandate to teach it .
Judge Jones has since told me that his only regret in the case is that he did not bend the rules to allow live TV coverage so more people could see the powerful evidence supporting his decision .
Because the one thing the prophets of talk - radio evolution have , it seems , is the loudest megaphone .

BAGHDAD , April 12 — A suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest struck deep inside the heavily fortified International Zone on Thursday , killing eight people when he detonated inside the Parliament building just a few feet from the main chamber .
In a separate and in some ways equally traumatic attack early in the day , a truck bomb destroyed the beloved , 60 - year - old Sarafiya bridge across the Tigris and killed six people .
The heavily traveled bridge has long been a symbol of Baghdad , illustrated on old postcards and drawings of the city from a more peaceful time .
The attack on the Parliament was the worst bombing to take place in the International Zone since the protected area was established four years ago , when it was known as the Green Zone .
At a time when Iraqis are increasingly questioning the government ’s ability to protect them , the bombing raised the troubling possibility that it cannot even fully protect itself , although it is at the wellspring of American and Iraqi military power in the city .
The bomber struck a half hour after the day ’s session had closed , in a cafe area where lawmakers were lingering across from the main chamber .
Among the dead were at least two lawmakers , both from Sunni Arab parties .
Of the 23 people wounded , 11 were parliamentarians , the United States military reported .
Fred Thompson tried to weasel his way out of his past support of McCain - Feingold today with Laura Ingram , but the Club for Growth did some fact checking on his claims :
Thompson says at about the 10:55 mark “ the issue ad thing was n’t even being discussed as far as I remember when the first debates were had and the first bill was proposed .
It was a matter of whether you wanted to get rid of soft money . ”
At 11:45 , he says “ they added on something that was a mistake — and that is the issue ad that you were talking about , and I voted for all of it .
So I support the first part [ the ban on soft money to parties ] , but I do n’t support that . ”
Fact :
He did support it .
You can debate about what you support when you vote for a bill on final passage that has warts , but when you sponsor a bill , it ’s your work .
No one makes you sponsor your own bill .
Take a look for yourself at title II of S. 27 , the so - called “ Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001 . ”
Title II has limits on issue ads .
Now the late Sen .
Wellstone offered an amendment , and made the provision even worse .
[…]
Thompson filed an amicus brief ( pdf. , see pp. 26-30 ) to the Supreme Court defending not only the original language banning groups from running issue ads , but the toxic Wellstone amendment too !
So he sponsored it , voted for it , and then defended it in Court .

Fox News Trumpets Iran War Drums Posted by Pile ( 9796 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ News Media ]
Robert Greenwald has put together a shocking montage of Fox news clips clearly showing the network 's attempt to lobby for another preemptive attack in the middle east .
This time in Iran .
I remember very clearly the daily fearmongering led by FOX as they cheered for war with Iraq .
The 24/7 images , sound effects , yelling and threatening were an ever - present drumbeat for war .
We had to invade , and we had to invade now .. anyone who did n't see that was a traitor .
They viciously attacked those of us who worked to get out the truth .
You'd think that with the complete failure in Iraq , those days would be behind us .
Sadly , you 'd be wrong .
FOX wants war with Iran .
It 's almost too ridiculous to believe , but it 's shockingly real .
We 've already compiled over 4 hours of FOX footage ... the same images , sound effects , yelling and threatening that led the U.S. to invade Iraq is happening right now to sell a war with Iran .
They are saying the exact same things !!
Here is the video evidence , side - by - side with what they said about Iraq .
Do something ...
Yeee haw

Republicans focus on attacking MoveOn.org ' Gen. Betray Us ' ad during ' surge ' hearing Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 10 , 2007
Print This Email This
In their opening statements Monday , the top Republicans on the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees turned their sights toward a liberal group 's advertisement in the New York Times today .
Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R - CA ) , vying for the party 's presidential nomination , said he was " aggravated " by the full - page ad purchased by MoveOn.org , which asks whether Petraeus will " Betray Us " in his testimony Monday .
MoveOn cites reports by The Associated Press , The New York Times , and The Washington Post that indicate the administration 's measures of progress are inaccurate and incomplete .
" Most importantly , General Petraeus will not admit what everyone knows : Iraq is mired in an unwinnable religious civil war , " MoveOn 's ad said .
Hunter accused Democrats of spending the last week " prepping the battlefield " by questioning Petraeus 's credibility , and he called it an " outrage " that there were suggestions the general could n't be trusted .
" He 's going to give us the one thing we ask , and that 's a candid independent assessment , " Hunter said .
Hunter 's Republican colleague , Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( R - FL ) , called the ad " outrageous and deplorable , " and she accused MoveOn of coordinating with Democratic lawmakers to undercut the testimony .
Ros-Lehtinen returned to criticizing the ad after Petraeus and Crocker gave their opening statements .
" Again I offer my colleagues the opportunity to use this hearing to distance themselves from the despicable ad that was published today calling into question the patriotism of Mr. Petraeus , " she said , provoking a sharp response from an off - camera committee member .
" Point of order , Mr. Chairman , nobody has to distance themselves from something they were n't associated with , " said the committee member , whose identity could n't immediately be ascertained .
" Take it easy , " Ros-Lehtinen muttered in response .
Later in the hearing , Rep. Jim Saxton ( R - NJ ) expressed his displeasure with the ad and held up a copy of it when he was questioning Petraeus .
Top Democratic Senator Joseph Biden said on NBC that he did not agree with the sentiments of the advertisement , but also disagreed with Petraeus 's expected conclusion that the current troop surge in Iraq was working and should be extended , according to Agence France Presse .
" I really respect him , and I think he 's dead , flat wrong , " Biden said of Petraeus on NBC television .
" The truth of the matter is that ... this administration 's policy and the surge are a failure . "
The following video is from CNN.com , broadcast on September 10 .
George Bush -- and other Iraq War supporters -- have argued that if we withdraw from Iraq the result will be like the slaughters -- the killing fields - in Cambodia .
Here are the facts :
The killing fields were real .
The genocide against their own people was committed by the Khmer Rouge .
The Vietnamese -- the Communist Vietnamese -- were the people who went in and put a stop to it .
The United States then supported the Khmer Rouge .
Here 's how that came to happen .
The United States got involved in the war in Vietnam in an attempt to keep South Vietnam from going communist .
Which it would have if nationwide elections had been held as promised .
Cambodia is next to Vietnam .
It was ruled by Prince Sihanouk .
He attempted to be neutral .
Both sides abused that neutrality .
The North Vietnamese send arms , support and men through Cambodia on the " Ho Chi Minh Trail " to go around South Vietnamese and American forces .
They also used Cambodian ports .
The United States , which was not at war with Cambodia , officially or unofficially , secretly sent armed forces into Cambodia to interrupt North Vietnamese use of that route .
In 1969 , Nixon began a campaign of carpet bombing sections of Cambodia .
Ultimately about 750,000 Cambodians were killed by the bombings ( though the numbers are hard to verify . )
In 1970 , while Sihanouk was out of the country , visiting Europe , the USSR and China , Lon Nol took over the country in a right wing coup .
There are two stories about American involvement .
The first is that we supported the coup , the second ( in Tom Weiner 's Legacy of Ashes , The History of the CIA ) is that it took the CIA and the United States by surprise .
Recently declassified documents support Weiner 's view .
In either case , once Lon Nol took power , the US supported him .
In return , Lon Nol ended the neutrality , closed the ports to the communists and demanded that the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese leave the country , and let US forces openly , though secretly , operate in Cambodia .
There was resistance to Lon Nol .
Some of it was certainly a spontaneous matter of national sentiment .
Some of it was certainly fomented by various communist interests .
Sihanouk , in China , then allied himself with the Khmer Rouge , Cambodia communists , which conferred new legitimacy on them .
Civil War broke out .
Lon Nol was both corrupt and inept .
In spite of American financial and military support , he lost .
America left Vietnam in 1973 .
The Khmer Rouge took the capital of Cambodia in 1975 .
They were one of the most horrendous regimes in history .
They practiced a kind of class genocide , " re-educating " and murdering anyone who educated or Westernized , as well as minority groups .
In 1978 , Vietnam , by then fully Communist , invaded Cambodia to put a stop to the Khmer Rouge and drive them out .
They installed a more moderate and sane regime .
The United States , the UK , and China then supported the remnants of the Khmer Rouge .
With their help the conflict continued for another ten years .
When George Bush , or anyone else , uses the Cambodian holocaust as a warning of what might happen if America withdraws from Iraq , remember the facts .
1. Part of the holocaust in Cambodia is directly attributable to American bombing .
The 750,000 dead .
( Comparable to the number of Iraqis killed by American forces in this war . )
2 . The civil war that led to the victory of the Khmer Rouge came about , at least in part , because of America 's support of Lon Nol .
3 . The " enemy , " the Vietnamese Communists , were the ones who put a stop to the Khmer Rouge .
4 . The United States supported the Khmer Rouge -- after their murders , after the genocide .
That support helped a civil war continue for another decade .
More death , more destruction .

Many people choose Prozac over other antidepressants
An Environment Agency report suggests so many people are taking the drug nowadays it is building up in rivers and groundwater .
A report in Sunday 's Observer says the government 's environment watchdog has discussed the impact for human health .
A spokesman for the Drinking Water Inspectorate ( DWI ) said the Prozac found was most likely highly diluted .
' Alarming '
The newspaper says environmentalists are calling for an urgent investigation into the evidence .
It quotes the Liberal Democrats ' environment spokesman , Norman Baker MP , as saying the picture emerging looked like " a case of hidden mass medication upon the unsuspecting public " .
He says : " It is alarming that there is no monitoring of levels of Prozac and other pharmacy residues in our drinking water . "
Experts say the anti-depression drug gets into the rivers and water system via treated sewage water .
Prescriptions increase
The DWI said the Prozac ( known technically as fluoxetine ) was unlikely to pose a health risk as it was so " watered down " .
The Observer says the revelations raise new fears over how many prescriptions for the drug are given out by doctors .
In the decade leading up to 2001 , the number of prescriptions for antidepressants went up from nine million per year to 24 million per year , says the paper .
The Environment Agency report concluded that the Prozac in the water table could be potentially toxic and said the drug was a " potential concern " .
The exact amount of Prozac in the nation 's drinking water is not known .
Simple HTTP Server with IronPython
Serving HTTP with HttpListener
Introduction The Python standard library includes several simple classes , like BaseHTTPServer for serving over HTTP .
These can be very useful for simple proof - of - concept implementations that present information via a web - browser .
This article implements a ( very ) simple server in IronPython , which serves over HTTP .
It does n't serve files from a directory structure , but is easy to extend to perform whatever task you want .
As well as using the HttpListener class , this article explores text encoding , asynchronous callbacks , URI and XHTML escaping , the system message box , and creating a simple Windows Forms dialog .
If you are new to .NET , this is a valuable tour of parts of the .NET ' standard library ' .
HttpListener
The basic class for listening and responding to HTTP requests , is HttpListener .
Note
This class is available only on computers running the Windows XP SP2 or Windows Server 2003 operating systems .
If you attempt to create an HttpListener object on a computer that is running an earlier operating system , the constructor throws a PlatformNotSupportedException exception .
This class probably wo n't scale to writing a production webserver or application server ( at least , why would you want to ? ) .
It is fine for simple servers though , and can handle client authentication and HTTPS .
There are two ways of using this class , synchronous and asynchronous .
In synchronous mode , the listener class blocks whilst handling each request ( like SimpleHTTPServer and friends ) .
In asynchronous mode , each request is handled in its own thread ( with all the associated complexity of threads if you are accessing shared data structures ) .
This article will use HttpListener in asynchronous mode .
The basic use pattern is very simple .
We need to use the AsyncCallback delegate to create the callback which will be launched to handle each request .
from System import AsyncCallback
from System .
Net import HttpListener , HttpListenerException
listener = HttpListener ( )
prefix = ' http://*:8080 /'
listener .
Prefixes .
Add ( prefix )
try :
listener .
Start ( )
except HttpListenerException :
raise Exception ( ' Starting server failed ' )
result = listener .
BeginGetContext ( AsyncCallback ( handleRequest ) , listener )
result .
AsyncWaitHandle .
WaitOne ( )
listener .
Close ( )
You specify the port to listen on ( as well as the domain to handle requests for ) , using prefixes .
The ' Prefixes ' property of the listener is a collection , so one listener can listen to as many of these as you want .
A prefix string is a scheme ( http or https ) , a host , an optional port , and an optional path .
An example of a complete prefix string is " http://localhost:8080/customerData/ " .
When you specify an explicit port , you can replace the domain name with a " * " to handle requests to all domains .
The listener is started by calling Start ( ) , which can raise a System .
Net.
HttpListenerException if the port is already in use ( or there is some other problem ) .
We start the handling of requests , by calling BeginGetContext , this requires an asynchronous callback - so we use the AsyncCallback delegate which can wrap an IronPython function .
The code above then waits for a request to arrive and then closes the listener .
To serve continuously , we can use : while True :
result = listener .
BeginGetContext ( AsyncCallback ( handleRequest ) , listener )
result .
AsyncWaitHandle .
WaitOne ( )
Here result is an instance of the AsyncResult Class , which " Encapsulates the results of an asynchronous operation on an asynchronous delegate " .
Handling Requests
The actual request handling is done in the function that we passed to the AsyncCallback delegate .
from System .
Text import Encoding
def handleRequest ( result ) :
listener = result .
AsyncState
context = listener .
EndGetContext ( result )
request = context .
Request
response = context .
Response
text = getTextFromRequest ( request )
buffer = Encoding .
UTF8 .
GetBytes ( text )
response .
ContentLength64 = buffer .
Length
output = response .
OutputStream
output .
Write ( buffer , 0 , buffer .
Length )
output .
Close ( )
This should be a function that takes one argument , the AsyncResult object that we saw earlier .
This allows us to get back to the listener instance and call EndGetContext , which releases the listener to receive an other request .
From the context ( an HttpListenerContext ) we have access to objects representing the request , and the response .
On the response we set the content length ( ContentLength64 ) and have access to a stream ( OutputStream ) to write the output to ( which must be closed when we have finished writing to it ) .
If we want to send text from a string , we 'll have to convert the string into bytes first .
We can do this with Encoding .
UTF8 . GetBytes .
The Encoding class is a very useful one for converting between text and bytes on .
NET .
GetBytes returns a bytes buffer , which is exactly what is needed by the Write method of the output stream .
SimpleServer Using all of this , we can put together a simple server class : from System import AsyncCallback
from System .
Net import HttpListener , HttpListenerException
from System .
Text import Encoding
class SimpleServer ( object ) :
def __init__ ( self ) :
self . text = " " "
< HTML >
< HEAD >< TITLE >Welcome to the Simple Server</ TITLE ></ HEAD >
< BODY >< STRONG >< H1 > Welcome to the Simple Server </ H1>%s</STRONG></BODY >
</HTML >
" " "
self .
pagesServed = 0
def serveforever ( self , port ) :
self .
failed = False
listener = HttpListener ( )
prefix = ' http://*:%s/' % str ( port )
listener .
Prefixes .
Add ( prefix )
try :
listener .
Start ( )
except HttpListenerException :
self .
failed = True
return
while True :
result = listener .
BeginGetContext ( AsyncCallback ( self .
handleRequest ) , listener )
result .
AsyncWaitHandle .
WaitOne ( )
def handleRequest ( self , result ) :
listener = result .
AsyncState
try :
context = listener .
EndGetContext ( result )
except :
return
request = context .
Request
response = context .
Response
text = self .
getText ( request )
buffer = Encoding .
UTF8 .
GetBytes ( text )
response .
ContentLength64 = buffer .
Length
output = response .
OutputStream
output .
Write ( buffer , 0 , buffer .
Length )
output .
Close ( )
def getText ( self , request ) :
self .
pagesServed += 1
url = '< P>< STRONG >URL Requested : %s</STRONG></P>' % request .
RawUrl
pagesServed = '< P>< STRONG >Number of Pages Served : %s</STRONG></P>' % self .
pagesServed
return self .
text % ( url + pagesServed )
This serves a simple HTML page , which reports the URL requested , and the number of pages served so far .
In order to illustrate it , the next section will create a Windows Forms dialog which launches the server on a separate thread .
It closes the server by aborting the thread ( naughty ) , which means we need to wrap the call to EndGetContext in a try ... except block , because the last call could happen after the listener has been closed when the main thread exits .
We get the URL that has been requested from the request object , using the request .
RawUrl .
To build more complex behaviour , look at the properties and methods available on the request and response objects .
For handling URLs , you may find the Uri class useful .
It " provides an object representation of a uniform resource identifier ( URI ) and easy access to the parts of the URI " ( including escaping and unescaping ) .
Having created our server , lets build a simple way of accessing it - a dialog .
The QLink is a device sold to protect you from those terrifying invisible electromagnetic rays , and cure many ills .
" It needs no batteries as it is ' powered ' by the wearer - the microchip is activated by a copper induction coil which picks up sufficient micro currents from your heart to power the pendant . "
Says Holford 's catalogue .
According to the manufacturer 's sales banter , it corrects your energy frequencies .
Or something .
It has been flattered by the Times , the Mail on Sunday , and ITV's London Today , and I can see why .
It 's a very sciencey looking pendant , a bit like a digital memory card for a camera , with eight contact pads on the circuit board on the front , a hi-tech electronic component mounted in the centre , and a copper coil around the edge .
Last summer I obtained one of these devices ( from somewhere cheaper than Holford 's shop ) and took it to Camp Dorkbot , an annual festival for dorks held - in a joke taken too far - at a scout camp outside Dorking .
Here in the sunshine , some of the nation 's cheekiest electronics geeks examined the QLink .
We chucked probes at it , and tried to detect any " frequencies " emitted , with no joy .
And then we did what any proper dork does when presented with an interesting device : we broke it open .
Drilling down , the first thing we came to was the circuit board .
This , we noted with some amusement , was not in any sense connected to the copper coil , and therefore is not powered by it .
The eight copper pads do have some intriguing looking circuit board tracks coming out of them , but they too , on close inspection , are connected to absolutely nothing .
A gracious term to describe their purpose might be " decorative " .
I 'm also not clear if I can call something a " circuit board " when there is no " circuit " .
Finally , there is a modern surface mount electronic component soldered to the centre of the device .
It looks impressive , but whatever it is , it is connected to absolutely nothing .
Close examination with a magnifying glass , and experiments with a multimeter and oscilloscope , revealed that this component on the " circuit board " is a zero - ohm resistor .
This is simply a resistor that has pretty much no resistance : in effect a bit of wire in a tiny box .
It might sound like an absurd component , but they 're quite common in modern circuits , because they can be used to bridge the gap between adjacent tracks on a circuit board with a standard - size component .
I 'd like to apologise both for knowing that and for sharing it with you .
Now to be fair , such a component is not cheap .
I 'm assuming this is an extremely high quality surface mount resistor , manufactured to very high tolerances - well calibrated , and sourced in small quantities .
You buy them on paper tape in 7in reels , each reel containing about 5,000 resistors .
You could easily pay as much as £ 0.005 for such a resistor .
Sorry , I was being sarcastic .
They are very cheap indeed .
And that 's it .
No microchip .
A coil connected to nothing .
And a zero - ohm resistor , which costs half a penny , and is connected to nothing .
I contacted qlinkworld .co.uk /2 to discuss my findings .
They kindly contacted the inventor , who informed me they have always been clear the QLink does not use electronics components " in a conventional electronic way " .
And apparently the energy pattern reprogramming work is done by some finely powdered crystal embedded in the resin .
Oh , hang on , I get it : it 's a new age crystal pendant .

Anna Clifford 's brush with the law proved a hair - raising experience for all concerned .
Particularly the police photographer .
He had to take several steps back to incorporate the full extent of her 18 in - high Mohican .
Scroll down for more ...
Miss Clifford was stopped for erratic driving in the early hours after a night out to celebrate her birthday with friends in Memphis , Tennessee .
She had the car 's sunroof open to accommodate her crowning glory .
Her performance in the standard test of sobriety
– walking in a straight line – was distinctly average , but police said they were not sure if it was drink or her peacock - like hairstyle that was causing her problem .
A breath test confirmed that she was over
the limit and she was taken off to the cells to
sober up .
Police spokesman Sergeant Vince Higgins said :
" We have to take the mugshot picture as the person looks at the time of the arrest , so we needed to make sure we got all her hair in .
" When we pulled her over she had been driving with her sunroof open to allow room for her hair .
I do n’t know what she 'd do if it rained . "
Mohammad Khan , blogger and web entrepreneur , meets the author at the Pearl Continental Hotel in Lahore , Pakistan .
Image : Jeff Koyen
LAHORE , Pakistan –
To look at a typical newsstand , Pakistan 's press appears vibrant and diverse .
There are more than 100 national and regional newspapers – several dozen in English – and judging by the oft - fiery editorial pages , columnists and journalists are free from shackles .
Compare this to other Muslim nations where journalists are routinely jailed , or worse , for the slightest slights against the ruling institutions .
Egypt. Morocco .
But according to local blogger Mohammad Khan , " it 's one of the biggest hoaxes there is – the belief that the ( Pakistani ) press is free . "
Indeed .
Reporters Without Borders ranks Pakistan 157th out of 168 countries in terms of press restrictions .
The Pakistan Press Foundation reported that 33 journalists were recently " detained " for protesting police action against a broadcaster in Islamabad .
So far , bloggers like Khan have managed to fly below the government 's radar , but the internet is coming quickly to this nation that borders not just India , but also China , Afghanistan and Iran .
A growing middle class already has DSL at home .
Internet cafes , though still limited , offer decent connections for just 20 rupees ( 33 cents ) an hour .
A 26 - year - old Lahore native , Khan is a web entrepreneur and a regular contributor to Metroblogging 's Lahore edition ( in English ) on topics ranging from local politics to national policy .
We meet for coffee at the Pearl Continental , Lahore 's most luxurious hotel , offering fine dining and armed guards to an international clientele .
Khan is sharply dressed in tan slacks and a tailored button - down , and he 's clearly well - educated .
His step is buoyed by the assurance of filial wealth , and he often ends his sentences with " Insha' Allah , " or " god willing . "
He is the modern Muslim man .
At times , Khan and Lahore 's other bloggers are openly critical of their government ; some have even taken a stance against religious fundamentalists .
Their writing is sometimes razor sharp , at other times meandering .
In other words , they 're typical bloggers .
" Yes , " Khan said , " there is a free press .
Freer press , rather .
And yes , that ’s a very good thing .
For example , you can now make fun of the president .
You can make fun of anything .
( Then ) they say , ' Look at how free we are . '
But that would be settling for less .
This is not free press .
Free press is being able to say anything you want . "
For several years , it seemed as though the internet would be ignored by Pakistan 's government .
In the early days , circa 2001 , Pakistanis were free to surf as they wished .
Their e-mails , though perhaps logged , were not overtly spied on or censored .
That changed in April , 2003 , when the Pakistan Telecommunication Company began to restrict pornographic and blasphemous websites at the ISP level .
Truth be told , few casual internet users noticed .
Until March 2006 , when Jyllands - Posten 's cartoons of Muhammad were published in a French newspaper , and the Muslim world reacted with fury .
To satisfy angry protestors , the Pakistani government instituted a blanket ban on 12 websites , including Blogger , where the cartoons had been reprinted .
Overnight , Pakistanis were unable to access their own and others ' blogs .
" Many bloggers have complained , " Khan said , " but we are so small that of course nobody is listening . "
There are workarounds .
The most popular , PKBlogs ( www.pkblogs.com, which was down at the time of publication ) , allows Pakistanis to connect to banned sites by hiding the destination from the local ISP .
Lahore is Pakistan 's cultural center – a metropolis of 10 million people wearing both burkhas and blue jeans .
Like New Delhi , Lahore is a flat and dusty urban sprawl , with several modest skyscrapers and plenty of six - lane highways .
But one wrong turn leads to cobblestones , donkey carts and a constant press of humanity that labors on its feet .
Shafqat Jalil , Pakistan 's press consul in New York City , summed it up best when he told me his country seeks " modernization , not Westernization . "

Blogging From the Belly of Beirut
By a vote of 4 - 3 , Republicans on Ohio ’s State Controlling Board blocked Democratic Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner ’s proposed $ 1.8 million contract for voting machine testing .
Brunner had already set aside the $ 1.8 million for the test .
Her specific request to the Controlling Board was a waiver for competitive bidding .
Her office had hoped to complete all testing by November 30 , 2007 .
Blackwell ’s successor , and a former judge , Brunner won election as a reform candidate , vowing to guarantee the public ’s access to the polls , and an accurate vote count in 2008 .
But , it seems Brunner has n’t been quite as aggressive as some of her Democratic counterparts like California Secretary of State Debra Bowen , who recently completed an extensive array of testing on that state ’s electronic voting machines .
Bowen decertified many of the machines and is on course to rework how America ’s biggest state casts and counts its ballots .
It ’s too bad Brunner is n’t following her California counterpart ’s lead .
The Columbus Free Press ran the story last Tuesday , Sept. 11 :
When it was recently revealed that 56 of 88 Ohio counties illegally destroyed protected materials from the 2004 election , Brunner showed little reaction .
She has also stated publicly doubts that the irregularities that defined the Ohio vote that year could have affected the outcome or that the illegal destruction of more than 2000 ballots could have been intentional .
But in attempting to carry out her promise to test Ohio 's electronic voting machines , Brunner has followed through on public demands that the ability of Ohio 's electronic machines to deliver a fair and reliable vote count be proven .
Tests and studies conducted by the federal Government Accountability Office , Princeton University , Johns Hopkins , the Brennan Center , the Carter - Baker Election Commission , John Conyer 's House Judiciary Committee and others have all shown clearly that electronic voting machines are unreliable and easily rigged .
The New York Times has now joined that consensus , calling for an outright federal ban .
" Electronic voting has been an abysmal failure , " the Times said .
" Computer experts have done study after study showing that electronic voting machines , which are often shoddily made , can easily be hacked .
With little effort , vote totals can be changed and elections stolen . "
Apparently , the Ohio GOP is not anxious to have a state study add to such conclusions .
At a Monday hearing , Republican State Representative Matthew Dolan attempted to table Brunner ’s request before she was allowed to speak .
Only the procedural intervention of Controlling Board President Joe Secrest afforded Brunner the courtesy of presenting her controversial proposal .
Compared to Bowen ’s tests in California , Brunner ’s plan seems half - hearted at best .
It calls for contracts with testing companies preferred by voting machine vendors like SysTest Labs and computer security experts from various universities to inspect machines under management of the Battelle Memorial Institute .
But , according to Ohio State Senator John Carey ( R - Wellston ) , tests conducted in California were the work of leftists and extremists .
Carey and Sen. Steve Stivers both questioned the independence and objectiveness of the universities listed in Brunner ’s plan , including Cleveland State , Penn State , and the University of Pennsylvania .
Cleveland State University Law Professor Candace Hoke , who witnessed the California tests of e-voting machines for hackability , told the Controlling Board that within ten seconds to two minutes . . . they found many different ways to hack the machines .
Both Brunner and Hoke stressed the lack of security measures now used at Ohio ’s polling places .
The issues of so - called sleepovers used in some Ohio counties , like Hocking , were cited .
This practice involves often untrained poll workers to take hackable voting machines home with them the weekend before an Election Day .
Brunner repeatedly emphasized the need to establish a chain of custody concerning both the access and memory cards used in voting machines , the latter serving as an electronic ballot box .
In recent elections , memory cards have gone missing for hours on election nights in both Toledo and Dayton .
State Senator Ray Miller ( D - Columbus ) declared that election security is the most important issue that ’s come before the Controlling Board .
He said , it ’s way beyond the building of buildings .
It goes to the core of our democracy .
Ohio Speaker of the House John Husted ( R ) initiated the attack on Brunner ’s plan on the morning of September 10 meeting of the Controlling Board by sending Brunner a letter demanding she remove the requested contract proposal from the Controlling Board agenda .
Husted wrote : " At the present time , too many outstanding questions remain regarding the scope of this request and the intent of the study . "
Brunner ’s response : " ... our testing process allows for parallel independent testing of Ohio ’s voting systems by both corporate testing entities and some of the nation ’s best computer security research scientists , allowing them to collaborate as needed .
I regret I cannot accede to your request to delay , as I need information to prepare for the early March 4 primary election so that Ohio ’s voters can trust that we have done all possible to ensure the safety , reliability and trustworthiness of our voting systems in Ohio . "
Early voting will begin in Ohio in late January .
But the GOP clearly intends to delay the testing in Ohio and conduct yet another election on eminently hackable electronic voting machines .
I can’t believe this is happening so close to the primaries .
SoS Brunner has to be a disappointment to Ohio voters , who sent a clarion message that Blackwell ’s brand of Rovian electioneering was n’t welcome in their state .
I ’m not saying it was under the same circumstances but we managed to get it done in Florida , and that was with a Republican governor and secretary of state .
Hit the streets Ohioans !
You ’re running out of time !
After all , we do n't want a sequel .
Peace
A brain scan might one day predict your voting patterns .
That is the implication of a study that found different brain activity among liberals and conservatives asked to carry out a simple button - pushing test .
The study implies that our political diversity may be the result of neurological differences .
Researchers have long known that conservatives and liberals score differently in psychological profiling tests .
Now they are beginning to gather evidence about why this might be .
David Amodio of New York University , US , and his colleagues recruited 43 subjects for their test .
They asked the participants to rate their political persuasion on a scale of - 5 to 5 , with the lowest number representing the most liberal extreme and the highest number representing the most conservative score .
The participants then had to sit before a computer screen and press one of two buttons depending on whether they saw an “ M ” or a “ W ” .
They had half a second to make each response , so there was a great deal of pressure to react quickly .

Surprising stimulus
Out of the 500 trials that each subject completed , he or she was presented with the same letter 80 % of the time .
This meant that the participants felt compelled to press the same button repeatedly .
“ You keep seeing the same stimulus over and over , so when the opposite stimulus comes on it ’s always a surprise , ” says Amodio .
When the less common letter did appear on the screen , the people who identified themselves as more conservative ( rating themselves somewhere between 1 and 5 on the initial questionnaire ) pressed the “ usual ” button 47 % of the time instead of switching to the correct button .
By comparison , the “ liberals ” who placed themselves between - 5 and - 1 on the questionnaire responded more readily to the new signal and achieved the slightly lower error rate of 37 % .
Brain recordings taken using electroencephalogram ( EEG ) technology showed that liberals had twice as much activity in a deep region called the anterior cingulate cortex .
This area of the brain is thought to act as a mental brake by helping the mind recognize “ no - go ” situations where it must refrain from the usual course of action .
Voting prediction
The new findings are “ interesting and provocative ” because they could perhaps help enable researchers to predict a person ’s voting behaviour based on brain scans , says Jordan Grafman , chief of the cognitive neuroscience section at National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda , Maryland , US .
Amodio explains that the fact that liberals achieved higher accuracy on the button - pressing task does not make them “ better ” than conservatives .
“ There might be other tasks or situations where a less sensitive or more persistent response might be more adaptive , ” such as when new stimuli are distracting , he says .
He also speculates that differences in brain responses might contribute to differences in political views or vice versa .
“ Conservatives tend to say that liberals spend too much time thinking and not enough time acting , ” comments Matt Newman at Arizona State University in Phoenix , Arizona , US .
But “ it would be a leap if researchers claim that there is an underlying biological difference that leads you to a particular political orientation . ”
He adds , however , that the new finding that conservatives stick with habit is still interesting given that previous studies have found they are more likely to resist change than their liberal counterparts ( Psychological Bulletin , DOI : 10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339 ) .

S&P expected the world economy to grow 3.6 % in 2007 and 3.5 % in 2008 .
The U.S. economy would lag at 2 % in both years , down from 2.9 % in 2006 .
" World growth remains strong despite the weaknesses seen in the U.S. economy -- especially in emerging markets because of healthy domestic demand conditions and export strength to non-U.S. market , " S&P said in a report released in Mumbai .
" The fact that the U.S. slowdown is concentrated in housing , which has relatively low import content , helps , " it said .
Emerging markets were far less vulnerable to credit market turmoil than during previous crises because of the capital flows attracted by high economic growth coupled with improved corporate governance standards , S&P said .
Moreover , high commodity prices were also helping many emerging market economies , such as Latin American and African countries that are major exporters .
Housing Weakness
S&P estimated that , on a purchasing - power parity basis , the United States would contribute only 9 % of world growth in 2007 , compared to China 's 33 % and India 's 12 % .
Housing was the major weakness in the U.S. economy and the subprime crisis -- which roiled global markets in late July and August -- was far from over , although its shock value was wearing off , David Wyss , S&P 's chief economist , said .
" We think in the United States the housing market is not going to bottom until winter .
We think the losses in these sectors wo n't really hit their peak until 2009 , " he said .
That would feed through to unemployment and remain a brake on growth .
" Housing starts are going to drop further , the unemployment rate is going to tick up further , we are expecting another year of sluggish U.S. economic growth , " Wyss said .
" We are not halfway through with this crisis yet . "
Wyss expected the U.S. trade deficit to shrink in coming months as stronger overseas growth and a weaker dollar would make U.S. exports more competitive .

Magnetic levitation Mk I 2004
I am working on potential exhibits for the Gravity Discovery Centre in Gingin , Western Australia , as part of an ' antigravity ' display .
The GDC is the public interface for the Australian International Gravitational Observatory which is part of a worldwide effort to detect elusive gravity waves .

It works !
( After a week of adjusting and testing ) A NIB magnet with some metal pipe is supported motionless , 1 inch below the coil .
" .. look Ma , no hands . . "
The circuit uses two linear Hall effect devices at either end of an electromagnet .
The circuit senses a difference in the two outputs which should cancel regardless if the coil is switched on or off .
An approaching magnet disturbs this balance and this this output is fed to a PWM ( pulse width modulated ) supply for the MOSFET output to the coil .
Conditions are set so that there is an equilibrium is setup with the weight of the magnet and the electromagnet at a certain point where it will hover .
Hmmm .. magnetism opposing gravity - sounds like ' antigravity ' to me ...

The left photo shows the coil and earlier circuit board .
The other two are of the neat side and the not - so - neat side .
Alright , so I do n't know how to do PCB's .
The coil will draw 10 A at 13V and is wound on an old solder bobbin .
In operation , however , the draw is less than 2 A at 12 V .
The drive circuit uses three LM324 quad op amps ( of which 9 of the 12 are used ) and a dual 555 timer ( NE556 ) .
This drives a IRFP450 MOSFET rated at 500V 14A under the CPU cooler fan .
There are two BYV29 500 V , 9 A , 60 nS diodes to absorb the back EMF when the coil switches off .
The circuit comes from Rick Hoadley 's excellent magnet site .
I have made only minor modifications including reducing minimum pulse width from 4 to 1 uS and using the MOSFET instead of an IGBT .

This is a standard 200 W ATX computer power supply which is 7 years old .
It supplies +12 V 8 A ( yellow wire ) , - 12 V ( blue ) and +5 V ( red ) .
It has been modified to include a power switch on the back panel and a divider across the 5 V line with a 24 ohm and a 10 ohm resistor in series .
This allows some load for the 5 V line (? need 0.1 A ) plus a 3.3 V reference for the orange lead which normally senses the computer board voltage of 3.3 V.
I did blow out the first supply I used but no problems since this modification which also powers the LED through a 100 ohm resistor from the 3.3V line .
I have tidied up the leads into one multicore cable terminating in a 25 pin plug .
( click to enlarge )
In action with a fancy mount and fitted into a suspended PVC pipe with all the wires tidied up , it can support a dish with 110 g of sweets .
( This was for a lunchtime demo ) .
It worked OK but unfortunately I left it running inadvertently for some time and the electromagnet melted through the end cap .
Ooops .
Remarkably the Hall device and the electronics were unharmed .
Magnetic Levitation Mk II 2004
Now time for a serious coil .
This was made from an x-ray ballast transformer .
The rectangular core was taken apart and changed to a solenoid core with enlarged ends .
Fortunately the laminations were n't fixed and were suitable to do this .
The iron core at 4 x 4 x 17 cm has about 20 times the volume as the previous coil and with the much higher number of windings , gives a much more efficient coil .
It runs at 60 V at 1 amp ( = 60 W ) at rest supporting a NIB magnet 3 inches ( 8 cm ) below the electromagnet coil .
At full power it draws 40 V 6 A ( = 240 W ) .
This power is supplied from a separate mains transformer .
Total weight is 10 pounds ( 4 kg ) .
Total levitating lifting power is around 2 pounds ( 1 kg ) but it will be supporting a NIB magnet weighing 160g measuring 1.3 inches ( 3 cm ) diameter x 1.3 inches ( 3 cm ) deep .
( click to enlarge )
Mounted on the coil are the two Hall effect devices ( one end is shown on the right connected to shielded cable ) .
There is a thermal cutout not shown ( microwave ovens have lots of these rated at 145 - 160 degrees C ) .
Also not well shown are a 0.22 uF 250 V polyester capacitor and a freewheeling BYV29 500 V , 9 A , 60 nS diode and heatsink to constrain the RF hash locally .
( click to enlarge )
This shows the mounting inside a 12 inch ( 30 cm ) acrylic sphere , with a high flow centrifugal fan supplying airflow through the PVC above it .
Without the copper block beneath it , the magnet tends to oscillate and become unstable after perhaps 10 seconds or so .
Despite my best efforts to counter this electronically , the most effective way to dampen it is to have a heavy aluminium or copper block beneath it about 1 inch ( 2 - 3 cm ) .
This still gives an effective display and you can spin the NIB magnet or have it completely in your hand still levitated and resisting being moved away .
Giving the magnet a simple spin with the fingers will keep it rotating for 1 1/ 2 hours limited by friction and eddy currents .
It will also support an iron object such as a spanner without a magnet as above .

The control electronics are essentially the same but I now use two paralleled MOSFET's on a larger heat sink for extra power handling .
The single control is for control of power and hence position .

The magnetic levitation demonstrated by Sylvia at the GDS .
This ( the mag - lev , not Sylvia ) has been on constant hands on public display since November 2004 and no-one has pinched the magnet yet .
The alarm that sounds as the magnet is pulled away helps ....

Magnetic levitation of a coil 2006
Here is an air cored coil out of a defibrillator output circuit .
Do n't know number of turns but the inductance is 10 mH ( I think ) .
It is drawing 6.5 A at 100V AC to get the lift of about 1/2 inch off a 1/4 inch copper plate .
It is tethered like a conventional lifter .
The power is over 600 W so gets hot quickly .
( click to enlarge )
The left photo shows the coil levitating above the copper plate .
The middle photo shows the 284 g coil lifting a 217 g solder reel ( total 500 g ) .
Current was a bit higher and distance off the base was 1/4 inch compared with 1/2 inch before .
The right photo with the clamp meter shows the current of 6.5 A .
( click to enlarge )
Above , left photo shows voltage across coil of 100.6 V , middle photo shows current of 6.61 A ( giving 665 VA ) and the right photo shows true RMS power of 0.55 kW ( 550 W ) .
I presume this is a power factor of 0.82 .
( click to enlarge )
Above , left photo shows double coils elevating with only 2 support wires plus the effect of a large iron mass beneath it ( none as it is greater than the skin depth in copper of about 5 mm at 50 Hz ) .
The right photo shows the setup of the two coils and true RMS power of 1.3 kW .
I did try levitating a MOT with the E section opened and facing down but really needed a better winding .
Hence I tried a non cored coil .
Levitation with magnetic induction 2006
I have cut down a large transformer to allow an external field .
It was 240 V to 110 V and rated at 2 kVA .
I use the two windings in series .
When run from DC it draws 15 A at 30 V or 450 W .
This is enough to levitate a large NIB magnet about 17 cm away .
This compares with a maximum of about 10 cm for the maglev unit above .
( click to enlarge )
Above , left photo shows the cut down transformer .
The middle photo shows an aluminium disc in place , and the right photo shows the disc being levitated .
The central drinking straw is to stop the disc sliding off the field .
It will spin freely .
Diamagnetic levitation 2004
A classical setup with a small cube magnet between two Bismuth plates .
A large magnet well above provides the lift and a fairly uniform field and the Bismuth plates help stabilize the area locally .
Without the diamagnetic repulsion ( or other tricks ) , Earnshaw 's theorem states that this can not be stable .
Note that this is permanent levitation without external power as used above .
The magnet rotates freely and is quite stable in the centre .
I have used 3 small Bismuth cylinders as below for levitation of a small cubic NIB magnet .
I have also used about 200g of Bismuth as 19 small cylindrical pellets in rows above and 19 below for large magnets but to levitate successfully the field needs to be uniform and the main lifting magnet needs to be larger and further away .
They are fixed firmly with ... tape .
( click to enlarge )
The left photo shows the display setup with large bismuth plates and the right photo shows the closeup of the smaller but easier to see single bismuth cylinders .
( click to enlarge )
The left photo above shows a 10 g bismuth cylinder showing a weight ( with support block ) of 38.96 g .
The right photo shows that this reduces to 38.57 g in the electromagnet field .
This is a 0.39 g or 3.9 % reduction in the weight of the bismuth .
It is not well optimized though .
Hardly levitation as the field is not strong and also does not have a strong gradient .
( click to enlarge )
The left photo above shows the 10 g bismuth cylinder with a weight ( with support beam ) of 24.38 g .
The right photo shows that this reduces to 24.16 g in the NIB magnet field .
This is a 0.22 g or 2.2 % reduction .
With the same magnet one can elevate a thin sheet of pyrolytic graphite which is the most diamagnetic stuff around .
Unfortunately I do n't have any to show .

Simple Meissner levitation
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO2eDJBr50E
There is an equally simple reason that neither of these predictions is likely to be realized .
It simply takes more than 100 years for a large , less economically developed country to catch up with the world leader in per capita income .
One need look only at the history of the United States , which had a much higher growth rate than Britain in the 19th century , yet did not catch up until World War I .
Or consider Japan and the United States .
Some 150 years after Japan started to modernize during the Meiji restoration , the country ’s per capita G.D.P. is still only 80 percent of that of the United States in terms of purchasing power parity — although , in nominal terms , it has caught up .
The United States is not standing still .
In fact , its per capita income grew faster than nearly all other big countries from 1990 to 2007 .
Europe ’s per capita income fell from 85 percent of that of the United States in 1990 to 66 percent in 2007 , according to International Monetary Fund statistics .
So let ’s say that the inflation - adjusted growth rate for China is 4 percent a year .
This is optimistic , because China will certainly have some bad years in the next century .
Every country does — remember the Great Depression in the United States .
A 4 percent rate is faster than any big country has ever grown for 100 years .
But assume that China can do it .
Assume , too , that America grows at the 3 percent rate it has averaged for the last 15 years .
Now project the two growth rates forward : the inflation - adjusted per-capita G.D.P. of China would be less than $ 40,000 in 2100 , versus almost $ 650,000 in the United States .
That ’s because China starts at $ 1,000 per capita and the United States at $ 43,000 .
If , in 2100 , China has four times as many people as the United States , as it does now , China would still not have a total G.D.P. equal to America’s .
But it is unlikely to have four times as many people .
It is always a mistake to project population growth rates for a century , but let ’s do it anyway :
With a one - child policy and a sex ratio that favors boys ( many men wo n’t find wives ) —
China should experience a decline in population in the 21st century .
Yet let ’s assume for a moment that China ’s population remains constant , at 1.3 billion .
If immigration to the United States continued at the current rate , America ’s population would rise .
If the population grew at 1 percent a year , as it has recently , it would more than double by 2100 , reducing the enormous population gap between the two countries .
Are these projections likely to be realized ?
Who knows ?
What is clear is that China is unlikely to surpass the United States in G.D.P. in absolute or relative terms anytime soon .
There may be a Chinese century , but it will be the 22nd century — not the 21st .

Baghdad morgue overflowing with bodies in courtyard
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 11 , 2007 Print This Email This
On Sunday , CNN showed bodies laid out in an Iraq courtyard for wailing relatives to reclaim , reporting that " for over a year , there 's been little or no room in Baghdad 's morgues . "
The " surge " plan did appear to be reducing sectarian killings in March and April , as the militias laid low , but now , as reported by the Washington Post in late May , the number of murders is nearly back to pre-surge levels .
Almost 750 bodies were found last month , many of them showing signs of torture .
An Iraqi police colonel explained to CNN that " the killings will continue as long as the security forces remain on the outskirts of neighborhoods .
Few Iraqi police dare to enter inside the most dangerous areas . "
The US military describes the increase in murders as a " spike , " saying that overall levels of violence are lower since the surge .
However , the report concludes , with " only a quarter of the capital under control , it 's difficult to see how increased troops on the ground will consistently reduce sectarian violence . "
The following video is from CNN , broadcast on June 10 .
Most people who are forced to travel by air have at least one good horror story ; the 6,000 international passengers stranded at LAX on Aug. 11 have the exact same one .
Airports have all the transient charm of purgatory , but for people like me , there ’s an extra circle of hell for our traveling sins .
It begins the night before , when the online check - in system bounces me .
The next day at the airport , the friendly self - serve kiosk informs me that there ’s a problem with my registration and instructs me to speak with a live representative .
I ’ve gone through the ordeal so many times I can recite it from memory :
I hand the airline rep my ticket and ID .
She presses a few keys , confused .
Then comes the Frown .
On occasion , there is a pursing of the lips .
The rep then scurries into the back room for 20 minutes or so , while the disgruntled gazes of the travelers behind me bore into my shoulder blades .
Finally , she comes back out and , without making eye contact , runs through a familiar litany of questions .
Birthplace ?
San Jose .
Occupation ?
Cal student .
Hobbies ?
Blowing things up .
Just kidding !
Eventually she lets me through , and thanks to my mad sprinting - with - luggage skills , I barely catch the flight .
Strangely enough , nobody ever tells me why I always get the third degree .
The airline employees feign ignorance or mumble something about “ a problem with the records . ”
But one day - furious after another abortive check - in held up my bleary - eyed party of nine -- I interrogated a particularly frazzled airline employee , who finally snapped , “ You ’re on a no - fly list . ”
Turns out he was n’t quite right -- it ’s probably not me who ’s a suspected terrorist .
It ’s just that I , like Michael Martin , that cute little boy in Florida who also gets checked out when he checks in , have the misfortune of sharing a name with someone who is either on a no - fly list ( barred from boarding a plane ) or a “ selectee ” list ( not banned , but nonetheless worrisome to the U.S. government ) .
But because I ’m not 7 - years - old and adorable , nobody aside from my mother cares if I miss a flight .
Young Michael ’s predicament with airline security became the travel - horror brouhaha du jour last month but , according to Christopher White of the Transportation Security Administration , that particular incident was n’t actually the TSA ’s fault .
If children match a name on a list , they ’re supposed to get an automatic pass -- it was the airline that bungled the enforcement .
That ’s the fundamental problem with this decentralized security system - the TSA hands the airlines incomplete information , and the airlines then have to play policeman .
The successes of TSA screening are rarely publicized , but the frustrations that this jerry - rigged system causes are seared into the minds of frustrated ordinary passengers .
Take the case of Asif Iqbal , then a 29 - year - old software consultant who flew frequently for his job .
Beginning in 2002 , Iqbal was unable to board a plane .
The computer would flash “ Passenger Name on No - Fly List , ” instruct the employee to call local law enforcement and then lock down and refuse to issue a boarding pass .
The first time this happened , four deputy sheriffs came to question Iqbal , and he ended up missing a day of work .
He came back the next day and was forced to go through the whole ordeal again , while being viewed with suspicion and irritation by his fellow travelers .
All this because his name matches a name on the no-fly list .
The punchline ?
The poor guy ’s watchlist - worthy namesake ( whose ordeals were later made into a movie ) was detained in Guantanamo at the time .
Here ’s how the process works right now :
At check - in , if your name matches a moniker on one of the watchlists , you ’re tagged for extra screening .
The airline employee will then call the TSA to verify your identity .
If it turns out you ’re not the terrorist they ’re looking for , you ’re deemed a “ false positive ” and allowed to go on .
If your information ca n’t be vetted , you ’re forced to go through more thorough questioning , further narrowing the chances that you ’ll actually make your flight .
This system is the result of a hasty fix after 9/11 , says Bruce Schneier , security expert , author and former member of a study group to prepare the federal Secure Flight program .
The problem is that it relies on distributing information to airlines , which often do n’t know how to use the data .
In the case of Iqbal , the TSA put him on a “ cleared ” list of passengers and gave him a letter to show authorities .
But for airline employees and law enforcement officials , the letter still did n’t make any difference - they did n’t know what it was and , after all , it could have been a forgery .
White said the TSA and the Terrorist Screening Center ( TSC ) have been working to cut down the watchlists by removing the names of the caught , the deceased or those otherwise unable to fly .
Michelle Petrovich at the TSC said the lists have been cut down by 50 % since last summer ( in March 2006 there were 44,000 names on the no-fly list alone , according to a document leaked to “ 60 Minutes ” -- up from 16 names on Sept. 10 , 2001 ) .
The TSA is working on a new system , Secure Flight , which would take the vetting process out of airlines ’ hands and put it all in a centralized database .
When passengers book their flights , they will provide such information as date of birth and gender , which will then be used to verify that person ’s identity without ( in theory ) jeopardizing their privacy .
With this system , that person ’s name would be checked against cleared lists and vetted in one smooth motion , saving people the pain of suspicious looks and the agony of missed flights .
Sounds good , no ?
But it ’s far from perfect .
Some have attacked the new system as a scaled - back version of CAPPS II , which went down in flames in part because it would have also used individuals ’ commercial data .
Last year , the Government Accountability Office expressed concern that “ without a completed system - security program , Secure Flight may not be adequately protected against unauthorized access and use or disruption , once the program becomes operational . ”
Iqbal told me he remains skeptical about the security system .
“ What ’s still unknown is , what ’s the criteria for someone to get on a no - fly list ... you can be an activist or a terrorist , ” he said .
Meanwhile , he still gets delayed in airports ; perhaps he has a new namesake on the list or something happened to the old one - the government wo n’t say .
On the bright side , Iqbal said , it ’s a lot “ more automated now . ”
So at least the new system should make things more convenient for me .
That is , if it goes into effect at all - the start date has been pushed back to 2008 after several delays .
In the meantime , I ’ll have to take matters into my own hands and send a “ traveler redress ” application to the Department of Homeland Security .
With any luck , that ’ll put me on the cleared list faster than you can say “ no fly . ”
Unless they reject my application , of course .
I do have to admit that the idea of being dangerous enough to warrant federal attention does hold a certain James Dean - ish appeal to me .
I see black motorcycle jackets in this future .
But if I get one , just to make life easier for airline security , I ’ll sew onto the front of it a scarlet “ S ” for “ selectee . ”

Media bias and corruption is evident in dealing with Ron Paul
It could n’t be any plainer .
Ron Paul was provided token coverage by most of the mainstream media talking heads in the beginning , but due to his growing popularity through Internet channels , they are clearly avoiding any mention of him and even ignoring the actual record of wins of straw polls and other evidence of huge popularity of this champion of freedom .
This is pathetic " wimpery " that is disgusting , bordering on treasonous .
Is most mainstream media that corrupt , that anti-American , that treasonous , that anti-constitutional , that " terroristic " that they are willing to destroy this nation ( and their own lifestyles I might add ) by backing the same insanity that has been destroying our country for decades ?
Albert Einstein stated that the definition for insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result .
We ’ve been practicing the Republican v. Democrat facade for countless years , believing we really have a choice in either of these agendas .
This is simply two faces on the same sick head , and wo n’t provide us with anything different , just more of the same .
Ron Paul ’s record is clear , and has been for 20 years .
It is factual and it is abundant across the country , but most of the media , and the ruling powers , despise and fear him because he stands for truth and he reminds them every time they hear him speak , and look in the mirror at home , of what they have become ... whores for the military industrial complex , traitors , and domestic terrorists .
The corrupt , evil , greedy power - mongerers are likely discussing how they wish they could assassinate him without it being too obvious .
Ron Paul threatens everything they stand for , and is the only political voice that is defending American freedom , sovereignty and our way of life .
The media and elite with such attitudes against him , and America , are traitors , cannibals and the lowest of humanity .
Terrorists on American soil .
Is America so asleep at the wheel that they still believe in the Republican v Democrat mythology ?
Do they really accept what mainstream media says ?
Are they so addicted to the mindless pablum government and media put out that they cannot think for themselves , or research the real issues ?
Have Americans discarded the American dream , selling out their children for couch time , and receiving limited freedoms ?
Are there any leaders who take personal responsibility for where we find ourselves as a nation ?
Ron Paul is one who loves country , freedom and sovereignty enough to stand up and speak the truth .
We want him to speak the truth because we are behind him ... those who realize that freedom is NOT free , but requires vigilance , responsibility and fearlessness .
Will the media continue to ignore the most popular candidate in the country ?
I for one am sick to death of all this idiocy , stupidity and lawlessness .
We fight now , or our country dies now , it ’s as simple as that .
We hold our leaders personally responsible .
We charge them with crimes where they have violated the law and Constitution .
We sue them personally if we have to for violating our personal rights .
They are racketeers , nothing more .
Support for Ron Paul is support for freedom and a fight against obese and corrupt government .
Supporting the status quo is begging for more of the same pathetic , criminal , police state movements ... which will surely destroy us if we do not FIGHT .
We have to do the media ’s job for them .
They have become shameful shells of what they used to be .
Educate your family , friends , neighbors .
Get the word out about Ron Paul .
Get his posters , cards , signs .
Get church members and other organizations involved .
Email everyone you know .
We are at a crossroads here ... critical mass for destruction of our way of life is upon us ... like a nuclear reaction about to be unleashed .
We either stop it , or we disappear in the wake of the reaction .
We have the choice , here , now , to make a difference , or we can go back to sleep and wait for the death of our country and freedoms to overcome and devour us .
Get this Ron Paul information out to people :

I ’m an historian , not an economist , so anything about economics - macro , micro- whatever , has been as foreign to me for most of my adult life as soil samples from Mars .
But several years ago I had an epiphany that shattered my then - left - liberal / progressive world .
I awakened from decades of delusion that I could adequately grasp world and national events without understanding the essential nature of how money works in the capitalist economy in which I live .
I realized that until I acquired that understanding , all of the other subjects I preferred to talk about - war , social justice , race , gender , environment , energy depletion , civil liberties , globalization , and many more were inextricably connected with the financial machinations of the imperial beast within whose belly I reside .
Today , I do not claim for one moment to be an authority on economic issues , but I have studied the works of some folks who are , such as
Catherine Austin Fitts
,
Michael Panzner
,
Michael Hudson
,
John Crudele
,
Paul Grignon
, and
Hazel Henderson .
From them I have learned to more skillfully read the tea leaves of the current economic upheaval that is brewing within the United States and is now rippling into the global financial markets .
Furthermore , I have realized that my government and the economy of the United States is being run as a criminal syndicate , and that the most useful way to understand the subprime mortgage meltdown and its implications was to familiarize myself with the economics of Tony Soprano , that infamous main character of the HBO TV series “ The Sopranos ” , Mr. King of New Jersey “ waste management ” and proprietor of the Bada Bing .
On Friday morning I opened an email from a friend who sent me an article by an old “ leftie ” I ’ve admired since my college days , historian Gabriel Kolko , entitled “
The Predicted Financial Storm Has Arrived
. ” Writing about the subprime mortgage crisis , Kolko noted that , “ What the subprime market did was unleash a far greater maelstrom involving banks in Germany , France , Asia , and throughout the world , calling into question much of the world financial system as it has developed over the past decade . ”
After explaining the international ramifications of the crisis , Kolko concludes :
We are at an end of an era , living through the worst financial panic in many decades .
Now begins global financial instability .
It is impossible to speculate how long today ’s turmoil will last - but there now exists an uncertainty and lack of confidence that has been unparalleled since the 1930s - and this ignorance and fear is itself a crucial factor .
The moment of reckoning for bankers and bosses has arrived .
What is very clear is that losses are massive and the entire developed world is now experiencing the worst economic crisis since 1945 , one in which troubles in one nation compound those in others .
But later that day , President Bush stepped up to the cameras and declared that the U.S. government would provide assistance to borrowers in the U.S. who had been hit by the subprime crisis .
Knowing full well that anything this government promises in the way of “ relief ” or “ assistance ” is almost guaranteed to be as “ helpful ” and “ assisting ” as that which it provided New Orleans in the throes of Katrina , I wanted to put this so - called bail out under the microscope and comprehend its actual substance .
You Mean This Did n’t “ Just Happen ? ”
I started with Catherine Austin Fitts ’s statement on her Solari site that “ As we work to mitigate investment losses in the mortgage market and the harm done to communities through the fraudulent inducement of debt , we are well served to understand what has happened , who is benefiting , and why . ”
And what is fraudulent inducement ?
Nothing more or less than inducing people who cannot pay their debts to borrow huge sums of money .
The subprime crisis has now revealed the myriad “ creative ” methods used by lenders to make this happen .
Tony Soprano would not only be proud of them , but would promote them .
In a CNN Money article “ Mortgage Meltdown : Here Come The Judgments ” from August 21 , a California real estate attorney speaking about the many lawsuits that are resulting from the mortgage meltdown , stated that “ Most claims will be against mortgage brokers for putting them into loans where they should n’t have been . ”
A property law professor at the University of California added that “ … overly exuberant brokers and loan officers told clients not to worry about concerns like their ARMs ( adjustable rate mortgage ) resetting ; they could always refinance and , anyway , interest rates were bound to fall . ”
The end result , of course , has been millions of people with houses , which as one Florida real estate law attorney stated , they ca n’t refinance , they ca n’t sell , and they ca n’t afford .
For many of those borrowers , class action suits are the only way they can find some sort of remedy for their nightmare .
I was now getting clearer on what fraudulent inducement really means and the tragic ramifications for borrowers victimized by it .
None of this , obviously , “ just happened . ”
Or as Fitts asserts :
Recently , we have seen numerous press accounts of bank and hedge fund losses from sub - prime mortgages .
Remarkably , these reports imply that the losses are the result of a market downturn or contracting credit cycle .
But there has been no mention of the extraordinary profits that were generated or who reaped them .
There is no mention of who is poised to make a fortune on the bubble collapse .
Even the most sophisticated commentators of our day are describing this financial coup d’etat as the unintentional consequence of “ market forces ” .
But how exactly did this work ?
And how exactly does the “ bail out ” serve the interests of lenders , not borrowers ?
My research has led me to conclude that the bail out will unfold in the following manner :
The Federal Reserve is lending money - that is , digital entries into accounts payable to hedge funds based on worthless mortgages , meaning that the these funds can borrow money cheaply in ways that will enable them to make huge profits .
This is essentially a back - door subsidy from the Fed .
At the same time , the Fed is most likely pumping credit into the market to pull it up because while feigning calm and cool , the Fed is terrified about the markets tanking .
As Steven Weisman wrote in the New York Times on August 31 , “ Despite the assertion that affecting the markets is not the goal , one administration official said concern about Wall Street ’s reaction did affect the timing of the briefing .
He said there was a fear that if the White House announced in the morning that Mr. Bush would be making an announcement on housing , there could be confusion as buyers and sellers of mortgage securities guessed what the announcement would be . ”
As a result of Bush ’s announcement , of course , the markets spiked .
Or perhaps it was n’t just as a result of the bogus “ bail out . ”
After all , John Crudele has been writing profusely about the Wall St. Plunge Protection team , euphemistically referred to as the President ’s Working Group On Financial Markets which was established on March 18 , 1988 by Executive Order 12631 .
In a June 8 , 2006 New York Post article , Crudele stated :
Back during a stock market crisis in 1989 , a guy named Robert Heller - who had just left the Federal Reserve Board - suggested that the government rig the stock market in times of dire emergency .
….. Proposed as an op -ed in the Wall Street Journal , it ’s a seminal argument that says when a crisis occurs on Wall Street “ instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity , and thereby increasing the danger of inflation , the Fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market , thus stabilizing the market as a whole . ”
Had Heller been any other schmoe who writes op - ed pieces for The Journal this would have been long forgotten .
But he had served for three years as a governor at the Fed and this proposal had the look of a trial balloon since stocks had just fallen sharply on Oct. 13 , 1989 , and memories of the 1987 crash were still fresh .
Over the next few years people like me … suspected that Heller ’s plan was indeed in effect .
Whenever the stock market was in trouble someone seemed to ride to the rescue .
Often it was a Wall Street firm that seemed more courageous than fiscally responsible .
Often it appeared to be Goldman Sachs , which just happens to be where Paulson and former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin worked .
… For a while I thought something called the Currency Stabilization Fund - which actually exists at the U.S.
Treasury but is meant for currency stability - was the slush fund used for this venture .
I was told by people who claimed to know that this part of the theory was n’t so .
WWTSD ?
( What would Tony Soprano do ? )
The Bush bail out means that the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) will refinance mortgages in trouble , but this put borrowers in debt - yet again .
In addition , it ’s important to understand that the FHA has two funds : The General Fund and the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund which provides insurance for single family homes .
Essentially , what the bail out will do is create a huge pool of mortgages guaranteed by the FHA into a Ginny Mae pool which will end up bailing out , not borrowers , but mortgage brokers !
Investors from hedge and other funds , will buy these so - called mortgage - backed securities , guaranteed by FHA , but they are in fact worthless , resulting in both borrowers and investors being defrauded .
For example , a mortgage banker may have 100 mortgages which are worthless , and he puts them into a pool and issues securities tied to those pools and sells them to investors in Europe and Asia .
Former FHA Housing Commissioner , Catherine Austin Fitts , has written extensively on the fraudulent behavior of FHA which put her at odds with the agency and ultimately led to her departure .
Apparently , the FHA leopard has not changed its spots in the slightest .
Basically , what we have is a scenario comprised of three players : the borrower , the middleman ( mortgage lenders ) , and the investor .
The middle man is fraudulently inducing borrowers to borrow , and investors to invest , but the bail out helps no one except the fraudsters .
Or as Michael Panzner , author of Financial Armageddon writes :
Even assuming that some troubled borrowers manage to hang on , the truth is that enabling more of the same kind of bad behavior that got people in trouble in the first place will only make matters worse .
The hair of the dog that bit them is n’t a cure .
It merely delays the moment of reckoning .
In reality , guaranteeing loans for homeowners who ca n’t afford the payments , encouraging mortgage - holders to hang on until they ’ve been bled dry , and giving false hope to those who would be better off cutting their losses really only benefits one group :
The lenders .
Commenting on “ the greedy global financiers ” , The London Observer ’s Will Hutton states : “ Little people ’s taxes are underwriting the mistakes of big people , who in the process have made riches beyond the dreams of avarice .
Globalisation , it is now clear , is run in the interests of a global financial class which has Western governments in its thrall . ”
Calling the mortgage meltdown exactly what it is , theft , Hutton continues :
The last few days have seen some recovery in the financial markets and some hopes for a return to normality , but what does normal mean ?
The system that has delivered hundreds of billions of dollars of written - off loans with a global impact can hardly carry on as if nothing has happened .
The banks at the epicentre of the crisis should go bust and heads should roll .
The hedge funds which bought the debt , traded it and sold it on to banks globally should also be allowed to go bust and be subjected to much closer surveillance and regulation … .
Instead , most central banks and governments across the West are straining every muscle to limit the fall - out , assure banks and hedge funds that there is limitless public money on tap and that governments ’ first aim is to get back to ‘ normal ’ .
The explanation is obvious .
The Western financial system is too important to be allowed to implode ; credit is any economic system ’s life - blood and if the supply lines get gummed up because of a collapse of confidence and severely punctured balance sheets , everybody suffers .
Quite right , but at least we can be careful in future about the terms on which supportive cash and potential bail - outs are made , as well as drawing larger conclusions about the nature of the implicit contract between finance and society .
The last thing borrowers need is more debt !
Instead of a refinancing arrangement , the borrower needs a higher income and lower expenses which will allow him / her to pay down debt and improve his / her skills .
In the current George W. Bush - Tony Soprano scheme , every time a corporate player commits fraud , he gets to keep the profits , and borrowers have to pay an inflation tax as a result .
Eventually , this results in the fraudsters owning more and more of the nation and world economy until they own it all .
Money is simply printed out of thin air to bail out the fraudsters which causes all of our expenses to rise because we do n’t have the rigged income to hedge those costs as the fraudsters do .
The REAL Ownership Society
One of the key fraudsters for more than a decade has been Goldman Sachs which not only fraudulently induced a plethora of borrowers and investors , but promoted the outsourcing of millions of jobs during the Clinton administration so that lucrative jobs that could have employed borrowers and enabled them to pay off their mortgages were moved offshore .
Goldman Sachs has given us three Secretaries Of the Treasury in the past 15 years : Robert Rubin ( Clinton Administration ) , Steve Friedman ( Clinton ) and Henry Paulson ( Bush II )
It appears that the primary fraudsters are New York Federal Reserve member banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Citibank , and AIG ( American International Group ) which has also been deeply connected with drug trafficking and money laundering .
These are also the same players involved in the housing bubble of the 1980s and other scandals and such as Enron , World Com , and the shady Harvard Endowment Fund .
In his August 7 blog , Charles Hugh Smith asks “ Is the USA a Giant Enron ? ” noting that our financial system is based on cooked books , lies and deceptions such as : Bogus inflation numbers ; unemployment statistics manipulated downward ; a GDP back - adjusted every quarter ; balances sheets of corporations , pension funds , and government agencies massively understating liabilities and egregiously overstating assets and future earnings ; and visible , laughable lies from the mouths of top officials , all spoken with a straight face .
Economist Peter Schiff forecasts that :
“ Issued by government agencies , interpreted by spokespersons for the Government and the financial community … the information we get has been manipulated to mould a public understanding favourable to the agenda of the powers that be . ”
Schiff ’s prediction of economic doom has everything to do with the US mortgage and housing meltdown , a prophecy he made in the book before the latest market turmoil .
“ The collapse of consumer spending , associated with higher mortgage payments and vanishing home equity , will plunge the economy into severe recession , further exacerbating the collapse in real estate prices , worsening the recession and continuing the vicious cycle , ” he says .
We have only begun to see the reverberations of the mortgage meltdown .
They will be as sweeping and mindboggling as global warming or an earthquake measuring 10 on the Richter scale .
Tony Soprano economics are n’t necessarily noisy , but they are gargantuan in their reach and ramifications .
Global economic meltdown , initiated by the ruling elite of the United States with full knowledge of omnipresent , pervasive global resource depletion - or as some have called it “ Peak Everything ” , will obliterate the American middle class and result in the ownership of the planet by a voracious ruling elite .
Tony ’s predecessor said it best decades before Tony was even a twinkle in his father ’s eye :
Capitalism is the legitimate racket of the ruling class .

A data center is the most crucial and vital part of the building and therefore the best practices should be applied to for its set up .
The data cabling services should also be well versed in all such practices as it can lead to the results that are unmatched .
The data centers should be established keeping in view the ventilation factor as it can lead to the best results .
The servers emit heat and therefore should be placed in such a manner that the heat is never accumulated .
If this is not done then it can lead to issues and problems .
It includes slow server performance and possible fatalities which is never what a company wants .
The other issues which are associated with this are the fact that the data centers should be made safe and secure so that any external intrusion can be hampered easily .
The online security , as well as physical , should be taken into consideration before the work is started .
Some tech - related advancement should also be implemented to make the data centers advance and more efficient .
For all such applications , the professionals hired must be well aware of the techniques of data cabling and must ensure that the work is done as per the IEEE trends .
These trends have been developed as a standard by IEEE and every data cabling company should follow these .
The building services company should collaborate with a cabling service that abides by the IEEE standards .
Checking cables
The cables are always erected as per certain standards and once they are erected they should be pinged to ensure that the signal emission and reception are all OK .
The links through which the cable passed must not be kept tight or the cable might break resulting in issues and problems .
The data center is highly sophisticated and must ensure that the work is done as per the demands of the users .
It connects the facility with the rest of the world .
Not even a single cable should be of substandard quality as it can lead to problems which no one wants to encounter .
Clean cabling
The clean cabling is one of the ways of making sure that the work is done efficiently .
Some cables of the data center are such that they never come in packing .
All such cables must be cleared before they are attached or inserted into the wall sockets .
Dirty cables should never ever be installed and they can lead to ping results that are wrong and therefore inaccurate data transfer .
Clean cabling also refers to the fact that right joints should be attached and mix and match should never be the option .
Say NO to cheap glass
It is important if the fiber optic cables are installed and the data centers use the same techniques .
It is really important as the glass having a cheap nature can bend easily and once it happens it breaks .
The fiber optic cables have higher and tight requirements and these can only be fulfilled if a high quality glass is used that can take high speeds of data easily .

“ We think it ’s crucial that the Muslim world realize that there are evangelical Christians in the U.S. in large numbers that want a fair solution , ” Mr. Sider said .
In the last year and half , liberal and moderate evangelicals have initiated two other efforts that demonstrated fissures in the evangelical movement .
Last year , they parted with the conservative flank by campaigning against climate change and global warming .
This year , they denounced the use of torture in the fight against terrorism .
Some of the participants in those campaigns also signed this letter .
The Rev. Joel C. Hunter , senior pastor of Northland Church in Longwood , Fla. , said , “ There is a part of the evangelical family which is what I call Christian Zionists , who are just so staunchly pro-Israel that Israel and their side can do no wrong , and it ’s almost anti-Biblical to criticize Israel for anything .
But there are many more evangelicals who are really open and seek justice for both parties . ”
The loudest and best - organized voices in the evangelical movement have been sending a very different message : that the Palestinians have no legitimate claim to the land .
The Rev. John Hagee , who founded Christians United for Israel , was informed of the letter and read most of it .
He responded : “ Bible - believing evangelicals will scoff at that message .
“ Christians United for Israel is opposed to America pressuring Israel to give up more land to anyone for any reason .
What has the policy of appeasement ever produced for Israel that was beneficial ? ”
Mr. Hagee said .
“ God gave to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob a covenant in the Book of Genesis for the land of Israel that is eternal and unbreakable , and that covenant is still intact , ” he said .
“ The Palestinian people have never owned the land of Israel , never existed as an autonomous society .
There is no Palestinian language .
There is no Palestinian currency .
And to say that Palestinians have a right to that land historically is an historical fraud . ”
To those who are considering Erlang and Erlyweb as a framework for their website : just go for it .
A couple of days ago , there was yet another blog post on Reddit about the scalability of Erlang , with the same yaws - owning - apache graph we ’ve all seen before .
There was absolutely nothing new in the entire post .
In my opinion , there are many reasons to use Erlang that have nothing to do with server performance .
Those of you who found BeerRiot through the Ask Reddit thread about Erlang usage already know that it ’s built on Erlang and Erlyweb .
My experience with them will be different than others ’ , of course , but I felt the need to list a few of my [ completely subjective ] observations about this framework .
So , in no specific order :
I like the syntax .
I got past the comma-semicolon - full - stop confusion that many complain about within the first few hours of coding .
It ’s different , refreshing , and not too hard to understand .
Development cycles go really fast .
More than once , I ’ve hashed out some new functionality on my subway commute , then polished it at home and posted it the same evening .
Part of this is the pattern matching used in function calls and branches – it translates almost directly from my pseudocode .
Some complain about the lack of hierarchy and types – I love it .
It makes evening coding feel very free - form after eight hours of Java .
Erlyweb and Yaws are both very powerful and useful , yet their codebases are small enough that the thought of digging through their code does not intimidate me .
Erlang does n’t have all of the libraries of other languages yet , but they ’re not hard to get to .
Hot code loading and the ability to open a shell connected to your webserver does n’t get enough press .
I never stop my webserver unless I ’m making a huge change that I ’m too lazy to plan the transition for .
I dislike typing underscore .
I do think it ’s a good visual representation for “ do n’t care ” , but I just do n’t like to type it .
I often use camelCase to define my own functions , but it looks a bit messy in mixed code .
So , yeah , some of these are reasons to use Erlang , some are reasons to use any language with similar features , some are just things to note .
I just felt like there needed to be some conversation about Erlang other than its scalability .
If anyone has any specific questions about my experience with Erlang , please post them in the comments .
I ’ll either answer here or write another post to cover them all in a few days .

 Al Qaeda Lost 
RAMADI , IRAQ – I met and interviewed dozens of Army officers in Baghdad and Ramadi , but none who were as admired and respected by the men who serve under them as much as 3rd Infantry Division Lieutenant Colonel Mike Silverman from Midway , Georgia .
Junior officers and enlisted men nicknamed him “ the forty pound brainer , ” and admire him for his guts as well as his head .
“ He went out and spent 12 hours a day in his hot tank , ” during the battle of Ramadi one soldier said .
“ He risked getting blown up just like everyone else . ” “ I had served with him before , ” said another .
“ When he told me he needed me in Ramadi , that was all I needed to hear .
I mean , I did n’t have any choice because the Army gave me my orders , but that did n’t matter once I knew Colonel Silverman was out here . ”
“ I ’d do anything for that man , ” said a third , “ and I do n’t like officers . ”
Lieutenant Colonel Mike Silverman
I had dinner with him at the dining facility and interviewed him afterwards in his office at the Blue Diamond base in northern Ramadi .
“ How long have you been in Ramadi ? ” I said .
“ Since the last week of January , 2007 , ” he said .
“ When I first got here my area of operations was the southern half of downtown .
It was ugly then , especially for the civilians .
We found more than 50 dead in just one grave in the desert .
50,000 – 70,000 people have returned so far since the war ended in April . ”
“ Describe the progress you ’ve seen so far , ” I said .
“ Sure , ” he said , “ let ’s look at the Abu Bali area for example .
6,000 or so people live there .
When I first arrived there were 10 attacks every day just in that small area alone .
Since May 1 , 2007 , we ’ve had only one attack total in that area .
The people went from having two to three hours of electricity a day to having twelve hours a day .
Insurgents kept blowing up the power lines , but now that they ’ve been cleared out the government has put them back up .
Commerce has really taken off . ”
“ What ’s the most encouraging thing you ’ve seen here ? ” I said .
“ On the second or third day the PSF [ Provincial Security Forces ] took over a checkpoint on a highway . ”
The Provincial Security Forces are a “ national guard ” of sorts controlled by the tribal authorities in addition to the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police in the area .
They resemble a militia in some ways , but they ’re a legal branch of the Iraqi security forces , authorized and paid by the Ministry of Interior in Baghdad .
“ An ice truck dropped off its ice at a checkpoint , ” he continued .
“ The truck behind it in line exploded .
Everybody was killed .
For a five or six hour period we were n’t sure the PSF would go back to work .
But eight hours later they were back in business .
They are 100 percent committed to anti-terrorism and anti-sectarianism . ”
“ What ’s the worst thing you ’ve seen here ? ” I said .
He was n’t sure what to say and had to think about his answer for a few moments .
“ The worst thing I ’ve seen , I think , is the aftermath of a VBIED , ” he said .
A VBIED is a vehicle - born improvised explosive device .
In other words , a car bomb .
“ I ’ve seen that about ten times , ” he continued .
“ Some people are turned , literally , into red blotches .
Some are just vaporized .
Their families will never see them again , not even their bodies .
And the smell … there ’s this awful car bomb smell , the acrid stench of homemade explosives and diesel fuel .
Nothing else in the world has that smell .
Most of the VBIEDs were intended for civilians , but the Iraqi Police usually stopped them first at the checkpoints .
So they were the ones who usually got blown up .
The driver of the VBIED would panic because he was caught and then kill everyone at the checkpoint .
Nevertheless , the Iraqi Police kept bravely manning the checkpoints and replacing the police who were murdered .
I ’m telling you , they are n’t doing that for the 310 dollars a month . ”
“ What were the battles in the city like ? ” I said .
“ It would only be a mild exaggeration , ” he said , “ if I compared it to the battle of Stalingrad .
We engaged in kinetic firefights that lasted for hours .
Every single day they attacked us with AK - 47s , sniper rifles , RPGs , IEDs , and car bombs . ”
“ How many fighters were there ? ” I said .
“ Around 150 hard core fighters , ” he said .
“ What ? ” I said .
“ Only 150 ? ”
How could 150 fighters possibly transform a city of 450,000 people into a second Stalingrad ?
“ I expected you to say there were thousands , ” I added .
“ It felt like thousands , ” he said .
“ Anyway , I ’m only talking about the number of hard core fighters .
The 150 does n’t include the larger number of people planting IEDs .
The population could n’t do anything about these people .
They were terribly intimidated .
If Americans even handed someone a bag of sugar , his entire family would be killed .
There are graves all over Abu Bali .
People were taken there , decapitated , and shot in the head . ”
He does n’t really know how many hard - core fighters there were in the city .
No one does .
I asked Colonel John Charlton the same question – how many were there ?
– and his answer was very different even as his description of the fighting was identical .
“ It looked like Stalingrad a few months ago , ” he said .
“ There were around 750 fighters in the city proper .
It could be less .
I do n’t know , it ’s really hard to say .
You have to understand , they worked in five - to ten -man cells .
And it only takes one guy to fire an RPG or a sniper rifle .
They used mosques , schools , and safe houses .
We found an auto shop that had been converted into a car bomb factory .
Because they had such small cells it was very difficult to go in there and clear them out . ”
“ Do you think your friendship with the locals is genuine ? ” I asked Lieutenant Colonel Silverman .
Ramadi is in the heart of Iraq ’s Sunni Triangle , the most anti-American region in all of Iraq .
I had seen what appeared to be genuine friendship and warmth from the Iraqis I ’d met , but it was impossible to tell from anecdotal experience if that sentiment was typical in Anbar Province or even real .
“ I do , ” he said .
“ Do n’t just assume Iraqis are faking their friendship .
The first time I was here in 2003 I made friends with locals in Salah a Din Province .
They still email and call me to talk even though they know there is nothing I can do for them now that I ’m out here in Ramadi .
Some of the people we work with just want to make money .
For them it ’s all business and has nothing to do with their private opinions of us .
But most really do want to make Iraq better .
You can tell when you interact with people one - on - one if they ’re sincere .
You can see right through people who are insincere .
Many of these guys have been in fire fights with us , so I know they ’re on our side . ”
“ Do you ever meet anyone you suspect was an insurgent ? ” I said .
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ I think some of the guys in the 2nd PSF battalion were insurgents , mostly nationalists who got tired of Al Qaeda .
Some were Baathists or belonged to the 1920s Brigade .
Al Qaeda started killing them off so they switched sides .
One PSF guy in particular knows a little too much about taking IEDs apart .
He knows exactly how to dismantle these things , as if he built them himself .
I asked him how he knows so much and he said he used to be a TV repair man . ”
He laughed and shrugged .
“ But , hey , he ’s on our side now .
We call him the TV Repair Man and do n’t worry too much about it . ”
“ Did the average Iraqi here switch sides or were most of them always against Al Qaeda ? ” I said .
“ The average Iraqi post - Fallujah was not very happy with us being here , ” he said .
“ If the insurgency only attacked Americans , the people of Ramadi would not have been very upset .
But Al Qaeda infiltrated and took over the insurgency .
They massively overplayed their hand .
They cut off citizens ’ heads with kitchen knives .
The locals slowly learned that the propaganda about us were lies , and that Al Qaeda was their real enemy .
They figured out by having dinner and tea with us that we really are , honest to God , here to help them . ”
Anbar Province as a whole is n’t completely secured yet .
But most areas have been cleared , and it ’s increasingly difficult for terrorists and insurgents to even show up in the province let alone find refuge there .
“ Anbar Province all along the Euphrates used to be one huge rat line for getting terrorists into Baghdad from Syria , ” he said .
A rat line , in military speak , is an enemy logistics route .
“ That ’s over . ”
“ Do you think what happened here can happen in Baghdad ? ” I said .
He sat motionless for a time and considered carefully what I had asked him .
It was obvious by the look on his face that he was n’t particularly optimistic about it .
“ I do n’t know , ” he finally said .
“ One advantage we had here was that the tribes are like small communities , like in rural America .
The sheikhs are politically powerful .
If we turn them , we turn the people .
Urban areas erode tribal affiliation .
It ’s still there in Baghdad , but it ’s weaker .
So I do n’t know .
It did work in the urban parts of Ramadi , though .
If we can get it to work in all the provinces in Iraq – and it is working in Diyala Province right now , I know it is – then maybe it can work in Baghdad .
It ’s hard to say . ”
He ’s right that the formula works in Diyala Province , and in Salah a Din Province as well .
Both provinces , like Anbar , are made up mostly of Sunni Arabs and have had similar troubles with Al Qaeda in Iraq .
Even some tribes in the Shia South are beginning to emulate the Anbar model and work with the Americans against Shia militias .
The South , though , is very different from the Sunni Triangle .
The Shia insurgents are “ moderate ” compared with Al Qaeda , and not so likely to be rejected by the entire society .
On the other hand , the Shias of Iraq have never been as staunchly anti-American as the Sunnis have been and still mostly are .
Saddam Hussein oppressed them almost as severely as he oppressed the Kurds in the North .
The trouble for the Americans with the Shias is that so many prefer Iranian assistance , which they deem more reliable after President George H. W. Bush abandoned them to Saddam Hussein after the 1991 Gulf War .
What may make the Anbar model most difficult to implement in Baghdad , even beyond the erosion of tribal authority as Lieutenant Colonel Silverman noted , is that the Sunni and Shia communities each fear the militias and the death squads from the other community much more than they fear those from their own .
Ending the insurgency in Baghdad may not be possible without first resolving the ongoing slow - motion civil war .
“ What will it take for Anbar Province to stand on its own , ” I said , “ so American troops can leave ? ”
“ The people here need a more direct and trusting link with the central government , ” he said .
“ It ’s tough for Baghdad to get things out here .
They need to send more equipment for the police , and it ’s not happening .
People out here see a conspiracy in all this , even though that might not be the case .
Baghdad needs to go out of its way to build trust , as we did . ”
I had heard from several American officers that the Sunnis of Anbar see a conspiracy against them in Baghdad .
Some even blamed the government for assassinating Anbar Awakening movement leader Sheikh Sattar Abu Risha .
Anbar Province is almost exclusively Sunni , and the government is Baghdad is predominantly Shia .
It does n’t help that most Sunnis in Anbar boycotted the last election and have little representation in the capital .
( They vow a massive turnout in the next Iraqi election , however . )
“ Are you optimistic or pessimistic about Iraq as a whole ? ” I said .
“ I am guardedly optimistic about Anbar , Diyala , and Salah a Din , ” he said .
“ This model works there .
If we can control these areas , Al Qaeda has nowhere .
The reason my optimism is guarded , though , is because the people out here feel like they are second class citizens .
If Baghdad does n’t do what needs to be done , they will have a very tense relationship . ”
“ What ’s the most important thing you have learned in your time here ? ” I said .
He was n’t sure how to answer and had to think for a while .
“ Well , ” he finally said thoughtfully .
“ I learned something here that I had heard but never believed .
I expected a huge kinetic fight , and that ’s what we got .
I was told that you win that kind of fight not by focusing on the enemy , but by focusing on the civilians .
But I did n’t believe it .
It ’s true , though .
I know because I have seen it . ”
Sometimes , the More You Protect Your Force , the Less Secure You May Be 1-149 .
Ultimate success in COIN [ Counter - insurgency ] is gained by protecting the populace , not the COIN force .
If military forces remain in their compounds , they lose touch with the people , appear to be running scared , and cede the initiative to the insurgents .
Aggressive saturation patrolling , ambushes , and listening post operations must be conducted , risk shared with the populace , and contact maintained .
. . .
These practices ensure access to the intelligence needed to drive operations .
Following them reinforces the connections with the populace that help establish real legitimacy .
From “ Counterinsurgency / FM 3-24/MCWP 3-33.5
Earlier I published the somewhat counterintuitive excerpt from the counterinsurgency manual he was referring to , but here it is again : “ What do you think about the media coverage of the Anbar Awakening ? ” I said .
“ I think it ’s pretty accurate , actually , ” he said , in contrast to the complaints I usually heard about the media from the military .
Most soldiers and Marines who grouse about the media , though , are thinking of the war coverage in general rather than reports from Anbar Province specifically .
“ I think the media accurately describes the reality on the ground here .
The only real complaint I have is that every article I ’ve read seems to ask when the other shoe is going to drop .
I doubt that ’s going to happen .
Reporters might want to accept the changes in Anbar a little more at face value . ”
For a few days it felt to me like the “ other shoe ” had dropped when Sheikh Sattar was assassinated , but his killers failed to transform the politics and culture of Anbar in their favor .
No one can say whether or not another insurgency will erupt , but the odds are vanishingly close to zero that Al Qaeda – the most destructive “ insurgents ” by far in Iraq – will ever be able to operate again there with impunity .
“ Oh , and another thing , too , I suppose , ” he continued .
“ There ’s a bit too much suspicion about the Provincial Security Forces .
The PSF is actually the least tribal institution in the province .
They can go anywhere in any neighborhood and not be rejected as out of bounds .
The Iraqi Police have to stay in their areas or the locals will say what are you doing here ?
The media seems to think they ’re some backwards and tribal force , but they ’re actually the most progressive and patriotic force in the province . ”
“ What do you think about media coverage of the Iraq war in general ? ” I said .
“ Most of what they report is accurate , ” he said , “ and I ’m not going to take the same negative line on it like most officers .
It ’s true that the media does n’t have the same agenda in Iraq that we do , but I ’m not sure it ’s the media ’s job to have the same agenda in Iraq that we do . ”
“ What ’s the most important thing Americans need to know about Iraq that they do n’t currently know ? ” I said .
“ That we ’re fighting Al Qaeda , ” he said without hesitation .
“ [ Abu Musab al ] Zarqawi invented Al Qaeda in Iraq .
The top leadership outside Iraq squawked and thought it was a bad idea .
Then he blew up the Samarra mosque , triggered a civil war , and got the whole world ’s attention .
Then the Al Qaeda leadership outside dumped huge amounts of money and people and arms into Anbar Province .
They poured everything they had into this place .
The battle against Americans in Anbar became their most important fight in the world .
And they lost . ”

Vista slowly continues its growth
Linux more aggressive than Mac OS during the summer
7 months after its launch , the new version of Windows is taking , little by little , its place within its family .
The visit share of Mac OS is stable compared with January whereas Linux knows a slight increase .
Perimeter : Study conducted from to 1st January to 31 August 2007
Perimeter of 136,601 websites
In August 2007 , more than 6 visits out of 100 were made with Vista …
Since its launch at the end of January 2007 for the general public , Windows Vista regularly wins ground faced with other operating systems .
The graph below presents the monthly evolution of Windows Vista ’s visit share which passes 6 % in August :
0.19 % of the visits in January 2007 ,
+0.73 points in February ,
+0.98 points in March ,
+0.95 points in April ,
+0.81 points in May ,
+0.81 points in June ,
+0.93 in July ,
6.48 % of the visits in August 2007 : +1.08 points compared with July .
In order to analyse the extent of Vista ’s progression , in the graph below we compared Vista ’s visit shares with those of XP over the months following their respective launches ( 30 January 2007 for Vista and 25 October 2001 for XP ) .
There is no denying that Vista is not very far ahead …
Seven months after its launch , Windows XP thus made a little over 15 % of the Web visits vs. “ only ” 6.48 % for Vista .
Certainly , we can consider that the context is different : XP took over from more or less competitive versions ( Windows 98 , Millennium ) and was launched at the end of the year , a more prosperous period for PC sales .
Vista finally took over from an XP version rather well in place … so why change if one is not buying a new PC ?
Lets now interest ourselves in the repercussions of the development of Vista on the share of other Windows versions .
The visit shares of the different Windows versions within the visits of this operating system ’s family are represented below .
The visit share of Windows XP on the totality of Windows visits diminishes each month since January 2007 , in proportions that remain , however , little important :
Windows XP , the most used version , thus attains 87.8 % of the Windows visits in August vs. 90.5 % in April and 91.8 % in January .
Out of the totality of the visits of the Windows family , the share of the versions other than XP continue to diminish , with the exception of Windows 2003 of which the share ( very confidential ) stabilises :
Windows 2000 attains 2.84 % of the Windows visits in August 2007 vs. 4.10 % in January 2007 ,
Windows 98 : 0.99 % of the Windows visits in August 2007 vs. 1.89 % in January 2007 ,
Windows Millennium : 0.41 % of the Windows visits in August 2007 vs. 0.64 % in January 2007 ,
Windows 2003 : 0.41 % of the Windows visits in August 2007 ( like in June and July ) vs. 0.37 % in January 2007 .
… i.e. already two times more than Mac OS
The summer 2007 did n’t shake up the operating systems market , still dominated by Windows with 95.5 % of the visits for the month of August .
Mac OS , loyal second , shows 3.2 % of the visits and Linux completes this trio with 0.8 % of the visits .
At the family level of operating systems and over a vision of 8 months , the visit share of Windows is in very slight decline , whereas Mac OS is stable and Linux defends itself well :
95.47 % for Windows in August 2007 vs. 95.64 % in January 2007 ( - 0.17 points in visit shares ) .
After a drop from March to June , its visit share nonetheless picked up again in July .
3.23 % for Mac OS in August like in January 2007 .
After a progression from March to May , the visit share of Mac OS diminished somewhat during the summer , although its X Intel version continues its growth .
0.81 % for Linux in August 2007 vs. 0.73 % in January 2007 ( +0.08 points ) .
Consoles remain in 4th place with 0.08 % of the visits in August 2007 : 0.03 % for the PSP , 0.02 % for the Wii and also 0.02 % for the PS3 .
Windows Vista has just passed the 6 % use mark .
Controversial , notably at the levels of its weight and its instability , how far will the latest version of Windows go ?
Some already speak of Vista as an intermediary version before the arrival in 2010 of Windows Seven , the new generation of OS …
Rendezvous in the coming months on XiTi Monitor in order to follow its development .

Kucinich wants to go mano a mano
Dennis Kucinich has challenged Hillary Clinton and John Edwards each to debate him one on one .
He has been on the warpath since the two were caught on open mics yesterday at the NAACP debate , apparently proposing to have debates without the long - shot candidates .
Edwards said they should " try to have a more serious and smaller group " and Clinton agreed : " We have got to cut the number . "
( The conversation was partially unintelligible . )
Kucinich shot identical letters to Clinton and Edwards late this afternoon : " If you are truly seeking debates where there are fewer participants and where there is more meaningful and serious discourse , this is a great opportunity for us to join together in ... an open discussion on behalf of the American people . "
Full text of the Clinton letter after the jump .
( The Edwards letter is the same except for the salutation . )
Friday – July 13 , 2007
The Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton
United States Senate
476 Russell Senate Office Building
Washington , DC 20510
Dear Senator ,
Now that it has become abundantly clear to the American people that some of our colleagues prefer to shut off debate about the crucial issues facing the next president of the United States , I respectfully challenge you to a formal public debate .
My proposal is that we engage in a direct one - on - one debate on the most critical issues facing the American people : the war in Iraq ; healthcare , trade and the environment .
Rather than a mere forum restricted to 60 second answers that must avoid any critique of the history and positions of other participants , I am challenging you to a debate in the classical style .
With America 's constitutional democracy shaping and defining the essence of our government , the American people deserve no less .
If you are truly seeking debates where there are fewer participants and where there is more meaningful and serious discourse , this is a great opportunity for us to join together in and an open discussion on
behalf of the American people .
Thank you ,
Sincerely Yours ,
Dennis J. Kucinich
Dear Valued Client :
Last week you received a letter from the head of Long or Short Capital Management , Mr Juggles .
In this letter Mr. Juggles told you that although your money was invested wisely according to the prospectus , that money has subsequently disappeared .
We wanted to write you to let you know that after further diligence this is 100 % accurate .
Your money is definitely , definitely gone , for sure .
The feedback we received on the previous letter has revealed that you are unhappy that your money is gone but you were especially upset with our refusal to accept responsibility for your money being gone .
Well first we would like to remind all of our valued clients that you should n’t point fingers .
This is not just your fault , it ’s everyone ’s fault .
Even ours , just to a much lesser degree than it is yours ( especially important point for you to take away ) .
We have completed a detailed and rigorous analysis of whose fault it is and thought it was important to share the results :
The chart depicts graphically the small size of our fault .
After further study it was determined that all of our market share of the fault stems from one person : Mr. Juggles .
As of this morning we have resigned him .
Kaiser Edamame , our Germo - Japo restructuring expert and portfolio manager of our anti-union humor portfolio , will take - over for Mr. Juggles effective immediately .
We have also implemented several restructuring measures to ensure that when your money disappears in the future , it is less our fault than it was this time .
Starting on August 30th , before we invest in low - yield , illiquid securities with high default risk we promise to “ think - twice ” .
This represents a 100 % increase in the amount of thinking we have done in the past .
Also , in the case of our most risky investments , before we increase our exposure to them we will now “ sleep on it , ” something we have not done previously .
We feel confident that these measures will significantly increase your returns and hence our fees over time .
Please contact me with any questions .
Subprimely ,
Johnny Debacle
EVP Long or Short Capital Managment

A Dutch royal couple have acknowledged altering a Wikipedia entry about a scandal four years ago that forced the prince to renounce his claim to the throne .
A spokesman for the Royal Information Service admitted that Prince Johan Friso , son of the reigning Queen Beatrix , and Princess Mabel of Oranje - Nassau had changed wording on the " people 's encyclopaedia " to make it more favourable .
The pair are the latest to be embarrassed by a spate of discoveries by journalists and bloggers of " vanity " changes to Wikipedia entries .
Scroll down for more ...
The original scandal broke in 2003 when Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende announced his government 's refusal to support the princess - then known as Mabel Wisse Smit - becoming a member of the Royal House because she had given " incomplete and incorrect information " to him about her past , " resulting in a breach of confidence . "
Wisse Smit had denied to Balkenende having a romantic liaison with druglord Klaas Bruinsma while she was in college in 1989 .
Bruinsma was killed in a gangland hit in 1991 .
She later conceded knowing him and knowing he was a drug dealer , but denied any sexual relationship .
By withholding government approval of Friso 's marriage , the prince had to choose between Wisse Smit and his place as second in line to inherit the throne .
They married in 2004 .
On January 8 last year , someone using a computer at Huis ten Bosch , the royal palace in The Hague , altered the Wikipedia entry on Wisse Smit that said she " gave misleading and false information " to Balkenende , removing the words " and false . "
Scroll down for more ...
Wikipedia records the exact time and IP address - the numerical identifier of each computer on the Internet - when any user alters a page .
The IP address used for the January 8 alteration is assigned to Huis ten Bosch .
After the story circulated in the Dutch media , Friso and Mabel quickly acknowledged they were the revisionists .
" They both made the changes together in order to make the entry match the letter which they sent to the prime minister ( explaining why they misled him ) in 2003 , " spokesman Chris Breedveld said .
The couple feel that due to repeated mistakes in the media , an " incorrect version of events has arisen , " he said .
Similar incidents of people or institutions amending Wikipedia entries have been popping up around the globe in the past month after a US graduate student developed a tool dubbed the " Wikiscanner " to more easily track the source .
Wikipedia records also show someone within the palace made unobjectionable amendments to the entry on Friso in December 2005 , correcting details about his university studies .

It was another day in the life of what is left of the Republican Party .
Sen. John Warner ( R - Va. ) guaranteed his legacy after 29 years in the Senate as the champion and enabler of an Iraq war he long ago knew was wrong but never summoned the courage to oppose .
After sabotaging Sen. Jim Webbâ€™s ( D - Va. ) fight on behalf of American troops , he might as well be called Senator George W. Warner .
Meanwhile , having done a disservice to the troops and military families , the Republicans in the Senate , continuing their unprecedented tactic of waging war through filibuster , did a disservice to the rule of law through yet another successful filibuster against even minimal rights for detainees .
Poor Republican Sen. Susan Collins .
She was upset because her Maine colleague , Sen. Olympia Snowe , voted in favor of detainee rights but neglected to tell Collins in advance .
Presumably Sen. Collins , facing a severe reelection challenge from Democrats , only votes her conscience for the rule of law when Sen .
Snowe tells her in advance that she , too , will uphold the rule of law .
While the George W. Bush Republicans in the Senate spend their day disserving the troops and the rule of law , we learn that the State Department has given certain mercenary forces carte blanche in Iraq .
Blackwater may be hated by the Iraqi people and what is known as the Iraqi government , but in this war sold as a defense of democracy , anything goes in what retired Marine Corps Gen .
James Jones has properly called an occupation that should end .
Feeling left out of this day in the life of the Republican Party , the white men running for the Republican presidential nomination continued their apartheid - like boycott of debates seeking to reach Hispanic and black voters .
It is astounding , bizarre and a sign of the magnitude of their collapse that Republican candidates do not even pretend to care about the opinions and votes of either Hispanics or blacks .
In their world , African - Americans hardly exist at all ; theyâ€™re little more than objects of voter suppression plans on Election Day .
Hispanics are treated like the background music for right - wing immigration politics .
Meanwhile , in the latest expression of extreme intolerance , a college student gets the Taser treatment at a political forum on a college campus .
It is true that Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , never missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity to rise to the occasion , did not distinguish himself .
It is also true , and far more true , and light years more important , that the Taser incident is only the latest example of an aggressive , extreme and un-American intolerance of alternative opinion and dissenting voices in which patriotic Americans in opposition to policy have been demeaned , ridiculed and at times beaten to a pulp .
President Bush presides over a government that commits illegal acts of torture , and then , according to the universally respected Gen.
Antonio Taguba , commits illegal acts of cover - up to protect the guilty from their punishment under law , for their illegal acts of torture .
There is a lineage of repression , from the crimes at Abu Ghraib to the beatings with the Taser guns , and to the sins of Blackwater and the attacks on democracy in the name of democracy , which have the common thread of disrespect for the core values , and the core ideals and notions of diversity and mutual respect that have been the soul of Americanism since the Liberty Bell first rang in Philadelphia .
Yesterday on the floor of the United States Senate the victory belonged to George W. Bush , and to Republican Sen. George W. Warner , and to the sycophants and shills who have enabled through their actions what they know is wrong on matters of private conscience , national security and honor .
In November 2008 in the voting booths of America , the bell will toll for those who bring these disasters to the nation , and American democracy will be cleansed of the abuses that should never have taken place in our country , and hopefully will never take place again .
We the people of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union â€ ¦

Do n’t look for any religious symbolism here – it was only a freak act of Mother Nature , says Sister Ilaria .
The nuns at Mother Cabrini Shrine in Golden were thanking God on Sunday that no one was hurt when a bolt of lightning shot out of the sky and struck their 33 - foot statue of Jesus .
The lightning bolt broke off one of Jesus ’ arms and a hand and damaged one of his feet , sending marble plummeting to the ground during a Saturday afternoon storm .
“ There were pilgrims up there on the hill , ” Sister Ilaria said .
“ The biggest miracle is no one got hit with the falling debris . ”
The statue of Jesus , which had one hand pointing to his “ sacred heart ” and the other outstretched , sits atop a mountain near the shrine in the foothills of Golden .
Drivers on Interstate 70 can see the statue in the hills , and at night , light illuminates the white marble .
Jesus , wearing a robe and glancing down , is 22 feet tall with an 11 - foot base .
Sister Bernadette was doing paperwork in her office when she heard the crackle of lightning .
“ We did hear a bang , but we did n’t realize it was the statue , ” she said .
The sisters hoped to have a structural engineer inspect the broken statue this week to determine whether it is fixable .
The historic piece is irreplaceable – it was sent from Italy in five stackable sections in 1954 .
“ We run on donations here , so we really have to look at the cost and see what will happen , ” Sister Bernadette said .
The sisters were thankful the falling marble did not break through a plexiglass shield that covers a heart made by Mother Cabrini .
Thousands of people visit the shrine each year to pray and pay homage to Mother Frances Xavier Cabrini , the first American citizen canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church .
In the 1930s , she established the shrine as a summer camp for orphaned children .
Visitors climb the 373 stairs to the sacred heart statue , “ praying as they go , ” Sister Bernadette said .

A mosaic of six distant galaxies located by gravitational lensing .
Each image , taken with the NIRSPEC instrument on Keck II , reveals a faint spectrum line ( circled ) in the infrared spectral region which the astronomers interpret as arising from a line of neutral hydrogen , significantly `redshifted ´ from its normal location in the ultraviolet .
The team has invested significant amounts of observing time to eliminate the possibility that each faint line arises from a different atomic species , for example as would be the case if the galaxies were at less extreme distances .
Image credit : Caltech
Using natural ‘ gravitational lenses ’ , an international team of astronomers claim to have found a hint of a population of the most distant galaxies yet seen - the light we see from them today left more than 13 thousand million years ago , when the Universe was just 500 million years old .
Team leader Professor Richard Ellis , Steele Professor of Astronomy at Caltech , will present images of these faint and distant objects in his talk on Wednesday 11 July at the ‘ From IRAS to Herschel and Planck ’ conference at the Geological Society in London .
The meeting is being held to celebrate the 65th birthday of Royal Astronomical Society President Professor Michael Rowan - Robinson .
When light from very distant bodies passes through the gravitational field of much nearer massive objects , it bends in an effect known as ‘ gravitational lensing ’ .
In a pioneering technique , the Caltech - led group used massive clusters of galaxies – the best example of natural gravitational lenses - in a series of campaigns to locate progressively more distant systems that would not be detected in normal surveys .
The team found the galaxies using one of the most powerful telescopes in the world , the Keck II , which has a 10 m diameter mirror and is sited on Mauna Kea , Hawaii .
Richard Ellis explains , " Gravitational lensing is the magnification of distant sources by foreground structures .
By looking through carefully - selected clusters , we have located 6 star forming galaxies seen at unprecedented distances , corresponding to a time when the Universe was only 500 million years old , or less than 4 % of its present age . "
When the Universe was 300,000 years old it is thought to have entered a period when no stars were shining .
Cosmologists refer to this phase of cosmic history as the ` Dark Ages ' .
Pinpointing the moment of `cosmic dawn ' when the first stars and galaxies began to shine and the dark ages ended is a major observational quest and provides the motivation for building future powerful telescopes such as the European Southern Observatory ’s Extremely Large Telescope , the US / Canadian Thirty Meter Telescope and the space - borne James Webb Telescope .
The new survey represents 3 years ' painstaking observations summarised in the thesis of graduate student , Mr Dan Stark .
" Using Keck II , we have detected 6 faint star - forming galaxies whose signal has been boosted about 20 times by the magnifying effect of a foreground cluster .
That we should find so many distant galaxies in our small survey area suggests they are very numerous indeed .
We estimate the combined radiation output of this population could be sufficient to break apart ( ionize ) the hydrogen atoms in space at that time , thereby ending the Dark Ages " said Mr Stark .
Proving definitively that each of the 6 objects is unambiguously at these enormous distances ( and hence being viewed at such early times ) is hard , even with the most powerful facilities .
" As with all work at the frontiers , skeptics may wish to see further proof that the objects we are detecting with Keck are really so distant " , confessed Ellis .
However , in addition to numerous checks the team has made following their initial discovery a year ago , Ellis and Stark point to supporting evidence from galaxies containing old stars that are seen when the Universe was just a bit older .
" We can infer the Universe had a lot of star formation at these early times from Spitzer Space Telescope measurements of larger galaxies seen when the Universe was about 300 - 500 million years older " , explains Mr Stark .
" These galaxies show the tell - tale sign of old stars ( and were described in earlier work by University of Exeter scientist Dr Andrew Bunker ) .
To produce these old stars requires significant earlier activity , most likely in the fainter star - forming galaxies we have now seen . "
Also associated with the programme is Caltech postdoctoral scholar , Dr Johan Richard , who is leading a similar , but independent , survey of magnified galaxies detected with the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes .
Although that work is not yet complete , preliminary findings support the conclusions of the Keck II survey .
European collaborators include Professor Jean - Paul Kneib of the Laboratory of Astrophysics at Marseilles , and Dr Graham Smith at the University of Birmingham .

Demand for green fuels has been driving recent farm price rises
According to the report , co-written by the Organisation for Economic Development ( OECD ) , biofuels will have a major impact on the farming sector .
Even without demand for the " green " fuel , recent falls in output - thanks to drought and low stocks - will keep prices high , the report added .
The study predicts prices will rise by between 20 % and 50 % by 2016 .
" Growing use of cereals , sugar , oilseeds and vegetable oils to satisfy the needs of a rapidly increasing biofuel industry is one of the main drivers in the outlook , " said the report , which was co-written by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) .
Biofuels - made from grains , sugar and oilseeds - are gaining popularity as countries look to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels , cut carbon emissions and push farm revenues higher .
Growth market
According to the report ethanol production in the US , which mainly uses domestic corn , is expected to jump by 50 % in 2007 - and to double by 2016 .
Meanwhile in Brazil - currently the world 's fastest growing ethanol producer - biofuel output is set to hit 44bn litres over the next 10 years , 145 % more than in 2006 .
" Bioenergies have become a key factor in the functioning of agriculture markets , " Loek Boonekamp , a senior OECD official .
" In the medium term we believe that they could lead to prices on international markets rising quite considerably , at higher levels than what we had predicted in former outlooks and above the average of the last 10 years . "
Looking ahead , the OECD And FAO expect prices to remain near the record highs they have hit in recent months .
As well as biofuel demand , other temporary factors which led to low harvests last year , as well as fears of poor harvests in the future , are expected to underpin prices at their current levels .
The rise in farm prices could contribute to rising inflationary pressures worldwide , along with increases in the price of commodities like oil .
Neve Shalom , Israel
The music blared in Arabic as a knot of women twirled slowly around the bride - to - be .
Well - dressed onlookers , some in traditional Muslim head scarves , clapped and swayed .
On this evening of celebration , the fireworks sizzled , sweets beckoned and jubilant guests congratulated the Arab bride ’s parents with a double kiss and hearty “ Mazel tov ! ”
Mazel tov ?

“ It ’s very normal , ” said Nava Sonnenschein , one of the Jews clapping at the edge of the dance circle .
“ For here . ”
The usual rules of the Middle East often do n’t apply in Neve Shalom , founded in the 1970s as a utopian village on a hilltop in Israel ’s midsection .
For nearly three decades , its inhabitants have sought to defy the polarizing tugs of politics and nationalism .
Though most Jews and Arabs in Israel are kept apart by segregated communities and long years of mutual mistrust , Neve Shalom and its 250 residents -- half Jews , half Arab citizens of Israel -- represent a living experiment in integration .
The tree - shaded hamlet , whose name means “ Oasis of Peace , ” is defiantly mixed , its bougainvillea - splashed lanes a mishmash of stone Arab - style houses and boxy , modern Jewish homes .
Advertisement
Schoolchildren learn Hebrew and Arabic together , a rarity in Israel , and play at one another ’s homes .
Residents enjoy an equal say in running affairs and have elected Jews and Arabs as mayor .
They also share management of the 120 - pupil elementary school , which draws many students from outside the village , and a separate School for Peace , a well - known training center for activists .
The community ’s name is in both languages .
In Arabic , it is Wahat al Salam ( though the Israeli government has never recognized that part ) .
“ We do n’t go out and protest in the classic way , ” said Ahmad Hijazi , a 40 - year - old Arab who moved from northern Israel with his wife in 1992 and is now Neve Shalom ’s development director .
“ We live , and put into practice , what we want to see . ”
A half - hour ’s drive from Jerusalem , Neve Shalom is both a functioning community and a peace movement showcase .
It has a website -- https://nswas.org -- and a parking lot for buses .
Advertisement
But this is no theme park .
The affections and hurts are real , the gains and setbacks intimately felt .
Alongside its taboo - breaking , the community has shown how hard it can be for Jews and Arabs to fully understand each other , even when they are trying .
Few know better than Abdessalam Najjar , a 55 - year - old village leader with a balding head and pencil - thin beard tracing his jawline .
Najjar , the father of the bride , moved to Neve Shalom in 1979 with a new wife , Ayshe , and a heart full of hope .
He was 27 and willing to take a chance , she 19 and in need of some persuading .
Najjar , a devout Muslim , had been involved in discussion groups with Jews while studying at a branch of Hebrew University in nearby Rehovot .
Clashes between Arab demonstrators and Israeli authorities a few years earlier that left six Arabs dead had generated new urgency over trying to improve relations .
The Najjars were the first Arab family to join Neve Shalom .
Almost 30 years later , they are mainstays , well - liked and respected across the community .
Najjar has been mayor and is working with a Jewish colleague in developing the community ’s new spiritual center for interfaith conferences , lectures on peace topics and prayer .

The couple built a life and home in Neve Shalom , “ slowly , brick after brick , ” Najjar said .
After the arrival a year later of the first of their four children , Ayshe watched over the village ’s growing crop of babies -- Jews and Arabs -- and he turned his efforts to helping start the village ’s bilingual school .
He was one of two teachers .
He says residents have succeeded in creating an environment for raising tolerant children .
For the grown - ups too there have been learning opportunities and innumerable debates , important and petty .
Najjar , for example , has argued with his mostly secular Jewish neighbors over his right to pray at work and over whether he could keep a few sheep at home , as many rural Palestinians do .
( He lost that one . )
Najjar said he once believed that conflicts break out only “ between bad people . ”
No more .
“ This conflict can be between two good guys , ” he said .

Neve Shalom ’s residents , mostly left - leaning professionals and academics , have been tested by two Palestinian uprisings , war in Lebanon and a steep deterioration in relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel .
At times , the two groups here triumphed over those divisive pressures .
At others , they fell prey .
To much of the rest of Israel , Neve Shalom is a harmless if worthy novelty .
But Jewish extremists once declared the Jews here traitors and sprinkled nails on the road to pop tires .
The village ’s Arab residents , who refer to themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel , often are asked by fellow Arabs if they really believe that Jews can accept them as equals .
The village today carries tempered aspirations and scars from past political fights .
Not all of these are over yet .
Jewish and Arab residents spar over whether Neve Shalom Jews should perform compulsory service in the Israeli army .
Arabs in Israel are not summoned to serve , and many object to residents of a “ peace village ” enlisting in the army .

They disagree too on some of the issues at the heart of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , such as what to do about Palestinian refugees who fled homes in present - day Israel during the 1948 war and their descendants .
Arab residents are resentful that , despite the talk of equality , Hebrew is the village ’s lingua franca .
While the Arabs learned Hebrew by attending Israeli schools , few grown Jews in Neve Shalom have mastered Arabic .
Some residents from both groups , now in middle age , fear that the village has lost some of its political daring .
It is perhaps telling that the burning issue these days is not potential peace talks but whether Neve Shalom residents can formalize their hold on the plots where they built homes years ago on land that was shared without private ownership .
“ There are so many things we do n’t talk about , ” said Ayelet Ophir - Auron , 51 , a Jewish special - education consultant who moved to the village with her family four years ago .

But residents say it may be success enough that Neve Shalom has managed to sustain its vision of mutual tolerance in a society with deep inequities between Jews and minority Arabs , who make up a fifth of Israel ’s population .
They assert that the project still has drawing power , even if it is from the fringe of Israeli society , and point to a waiting list of potential newcomers .
The village is full but hopes to begin adding 90 families in the next year or so by turning some of the vacant land surrounding it into housing lots .
“ It is enough that we are here , ” said Rayek Rizek , 52 , an Arab former mayor who with his wife runs a cafe and gift shop at the entrance to the village .
“ It will never maybe bring the solution to the conflict .
But there is still a small idea that maybe it is a candle in the midst of a big darkness . ”
Neve Shalom , a short drive off the main highway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv , looks from its hilltop over a panorama of rural tranquillity -- a sloping , rock - strewn plain turned paper - dry by late summer , and groves of almond and olive trees .
The village is arrayed around an oval drive , shaded by evergreen trees and other plantings that have swaddled a once - barren hilltop .

Village business takes place in the two - story administration building .
Two resident committees run the village and , separately , the elementary school , School for Peace and spiritual center .
Key decisions , such as passing the budget and picking new residents , are voted upon by village members in the style of a town meeting .
Neve Shalom has no stores other than the cafe - gift shop , though it sports a 39 - room guest house .
Its swimming pool is frequented by visitors from as far away as Jerusalem .
Most of the community ’s middle - class residents commute to jobs in Tel Aviv and elsewhere .
The village is a far cry from the rough encampment that Rizek and his wife , Dyana Shaloufe - Rizek , encountered when they arrived in 1984 .
Neve Shalom had been founded a decade earlier by a Dominican priest , Bruno Hussar , on a thistle - covered hill leased from a nearby Roman Catholic monastery .
Father Bruno , who was born to Jewish parents , envisioned a place where people of different faiths could live together , though without a fixed political ideology .

Neve Shalom ’s first young couples arrived in 1978 , motivated by the chance to craft an egalitarian way of life between Jews and Arabs .
The village looks out over the site of a key battle in the 1948 war that broke out with Israel ’s independence .
Shaloufe - Rizek , who had been a student activist at Haifa University , was invited to teach at Neve Shalom ’s peace school , which she had attended after its establishment in 1979 .
Newly married , she brought her husband .
“ There was nothing .
No paved roads .
A lot of flies and mosquitoes , ” Rayek Rizek recalled .
But it was an exhilarating place for Jews and Arabs to confront their yawning ignorance about one another .

Dorit Shippin , a Jew , arrived with her husband , Howard , the same year as the Rizeks after searching for a community that was , she said , “ pluralistic enough and open - minded . ”
She recalled being stunned to learn that Israel ’s Independence Day was treated as a historical catastrophe by her new Arab neighbors .
“ My father participated in the 1948 war , and especially for this generation , the stories that they have are not stories of destruction and deportation of Palestinians , but they are stories of conquering , freeing , friendships and survival , ” Shippin said .
“ It was quite shocking to hear the other side of the picture . ”
For their part , Arab residents began to assume the burden of shared leadership and to confront a fuller portrait of Jews than the unflattering images many had grown up with .
The community ’s discussions were earnest , often heated .
But the outbreak of the first intifada in 1987 drove home for many residents the fundamental gap that remained in how each side viewed the world .

“ The Palestinians saw it mostly as a kind of legitimate struggle of the people under occupation , and the Israelis saw it as an unnecessary kind of uprising that threatens their life , and their existence here , ” Rizek said .
Some residents wonder , though , whether the community too often has steered around explosive issues to preserve neighborly harmony .
“ As the years went by , it became more and more challenging to talk about the difficult issues , ” said Boaz Kitain , a Jew who has been mayor and run the elementary school and School for Peace .
“ We stopped talking about the difficult things . ”
The community was thrown into turmoil when Kitain ’s 20 - year - old son , Tom , an Israeli soldier , died in a helicopter collision en route to Lebanon in 1997 .
Advertisement
The Kitain family asked to put up a memorial .
But some Arab residents found it unthinkable that a community dedicated to peace would commemorate a soldier on a military mission , even one who had grown up in their midst .
The debate grew bitter .
To the Kitains , it only aggravated their grief .
Despite an eventual compromise -- a plaque on the village basketball court saluting a “ son of peace , killed in war ” -- the episode proved damaging .
Kitain ’s wife , Daniella , once active as fundraiser for the village , withdrew from community affairs .
She has never rejoined .
Community relations have fared better since then , despite the buffeting effects of the second intifada , which further worsened Jewish - Arab relations in Israel , and the nation ’s war against the Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah in Lebanon last year .
Both times , Neve Shalom ’s residents threw themselves into common action .
After the second intifada broke out in 2000 , they formed a motorcade to show support for families of 13 Arabs killed during rioting and delivered medical aid to Palestinians in the West Bank , a big swath of which sits within a 30 - minute drive .
Advertisement
“ This is when residents felt even more that we have to come together and try to do something for the outside , ” said Hijazi , the development director .
There is also much thinking here about the future .
The community plans to keep up its education efforts , mainly through the School for Peace , which over the years has provided training workshops for 40,000 peace and human rights activists and others .
Supported heavily by foreign donations , it has served as an incubator for the Israeli and Palestinian peace movements , with alumni sprinkled among important activist groups on both sides .
A planned residential expansion , which would nearly triple the number of families to almost 150 , could lend the project more symbolic clout by increasing its size .

Some residents are urging a more activist role for the community in Israeli politics at a moment when polls show abysmal relations between Jews and Arabs .
“ It ’s time for us to go out more , even if they do n’t want to hear us , ” Dorit Shippin said .
“ We have to stop apologizing , really , and be relevant . ”
The community claims a tangible accomplishment in rearing a generation of children to have friends across lines of religion and ethnic origin .
Those young people have at times been unnerved by how much the egalitarian ideals of Neve Shalom clash with the stark realities of wider Israeli society .
“ It ’s like a dream , ” said Sama Daoud , a 19 - year - old Arab who lives with her parents in Neve Shalom .
“ It ’s different from the outside . ”
Advertisement
Tali Sonnenschein , 15 , said she and her friends were well aware of the tensions and stereotypes that cleave the world outside Neve Shalom .
She sees no reason , though , why that should stop her little community from seeking some way out of the mess .
“ I get to live in this place and have a different opinion -- that everybody can learn to live together , ” she said .
“ It ’s a little cheesy , maybe .
But that ’s what I learned . ”

Schools Chancellor Joel Klein yesterday fired a veteran worker whose movements were tracked for five months through the GPS device in his cellphone , leading to charges that he was repeatedly cutting out early .
“ This individual was getting paid for not working , ” said schools spokeswoman Margie Feinberg , explaining Klein ’s decision to accept an administrative law judge ’s recommendation to ax John Halpin , a longtime supervisor of carpenters .
Halpin had worked in the school system for 21 years and was conscientious enough to show up as much as two hours early for his 8 a.m. - to-3:30 p.m. shift .
He said he was never told that the cellphone he was given in 2005 could be used to monitor his every move and questioned the accuracy of the data it produced .
But neither argument swayed administrative law Judge Tynia Richard , who found Halpin guilty of submitting false time records when he left early on numerous occasions between March and August 2006 .
She issued a decision saying the Department of Education was under no obligation “ to notify its employees of all the methods it may possibly use to uncover their misconduct . ”
Jeremy Gruber , legal director for the National Work Rights Institute in Princeton , N.J. , said only two states in the nation – Connecticut and Delaware – require that employees be given advance word that their movements might be tracked if they accept a GPS device .
A spokeswoman for the city ’s Department of Citywide Administrative Services said there was no citywide policy on providing that warning .
The 11 - page booklet does contain one cautionary note :
Even when the GPS feature is restricted , “ location information may still be available to the phone ’s owner , fleet manager or account administrator . ”
Halpin ’s lawyer , Alan Wolin , could n’t be reached for comment .
At least one union has negotiated a deal limiting how GPS data can be used .
Drivers for United Parcel Service ca n’t be disciplined based on GPS tracking under the company ’s contract with the Teamsters .
But city officials said the issue had never been raised in negotiations with municipal unions .

In an interview late this afternoon in CNN ’s Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer , the incoming Congressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota , the first Muslim elected to the House of Representatives , talked about his reaction to the objections by Representative Virgil Goode , Republican of Virginia , to his election and decision to take his oath of office by swearing on the Koran .
Mr. Ellison :
Well , what I ’d tell him is that , you know , there might be a few things about Muslims that he might want to know .
He might want to know that Muslims , there are about five million in the country , that they ’re here to support and strengthen America , that they are nurses , doctors , husbands , wives , kids who just want to live and prosper in the American way , and that there ’s really nothing to fear , and that all of us are steadfastly opposed to the same people he ’s opposed to , which is the terrorists .
And so there ’s nothing for him to be afraid of , and that what we should do is to tell our constituents that we should reach to each other , not be against each other , and we should find ways for common ground .
I would urge Congressman Goode to have his congregation reach out to a synagogue or a mosque and start some interfaith dialogue so that we can increase understanding among each other , as Americans of different faiths .
That ’s what I ’d tell him .
Mr. Blitzer :
Do you think he ’s a bigot ?
Mr. Ellison :
You know what ?
I do n’t know the fellow .
And , you know , I ’d rather just say that he has a lot to learn about Islam .
And , you know , we all have a lot to learn .
I do n’t know him .
I look forward to meeting him .
I ’m not afraid of being frank about my views about him , but I simply have n’t gotten a chance to get to meet him so I do n’t want to start any name calling .
Asked by Mr. Blitzer what he thought of the reaction to his election , and to his swearing - in preference , Mr. Ellison said :
Well ,
Wolf , I ’m glad you made that distinction because when I ’m officially sworn in , I will do it the same , exact way as every Congressperson - elect who is sworn in .
We will all stand up and , in unison , lift our hand and swear to uphold that Constitution .
And then later , in a private ceremony , of course , I ’ll put my hand on a book that is the basis of my faith , which is Islam .
And I think that this is a beauty .
This is a wonderful thing for our country , because Jewish members will put their hands on the Torah , Mormon members will
put their hand on the Book of Mormon , Catholic members will put their hand on the book of their choice .
And members who do n’t want to put their hand on any book are also fully free to do that .
That ’s the American way .
But I think that we need to not focus on what religious text any Congress member might want to use .
Let ’s focus on the text that binds us together .
That ’s the Constitution .
That ’s a great document , and I ’m looking forward very much to raising my hand and swear to uphold that Constitution .
Mr. Blitzer :
So when you hear comments like Virgil Goode ’s , I suppose — you ’ve reacted in all of your public statements , as well as here , really taking the high road , but I assume inside , it ’s really irritating you .
Mr. Ellison :
Well ,
Wolf , you know , my reaction , externally and internally is the same .
I can honestly say that I ’m not angered by Representative Goode ’s comments .
I just think it ’s a learning gap we have to close .
And he and Mr. Blitzer reminded everyone that Mr. Ellison was born in Michigan , converted to Islam in the 1970s while in college , and traced his ancestors back to Louisiana , from 1742 .
“ I ’m about as American as they come , ” Mr. Ellison said .

It ’s easier to remember a “ Bill ” who really fits the bill , according to a new study .
Names tend to be associated with certain facial features — Bobs have rounder faces than Tims , for example — and it ’s easier to learn a person ’s name if his face matches it .
Robin Thomas , a cognitive scientist at Miami University in Ohio , noticed that she frequently confused the names of two of her students .
This did n’t happen to her often , so she wondered if there was more to it than just forgetfulness .
Then she realized this .
“ Their faces did not fit the name they were given , ” Thomas said .
Intrigued , she decided to test whether Americans have common ideas about what people with certain names should look like .
She and her colleagues asked 150 college students to design faces , using facial construction software similar to the type police use , for 15 common American male names .
To keep things simple , all of the faces were white and wore the same hairstyle .
Her team then asked a second group of students to rate how well these constructed faces seemed to fit their names .
The group agreed that many of the constructs matched — the strongest fits were for the names Bob , Bill , Brian and Jason .
Finally , Thomas wanted to see whether , as in her own experience , better - fitting names were easier to remember and vice versa .
Her team showed a third group of students the facial constructs — including both good and bad fits , as judged by the students in the second part of the study — along with their names .
Later , they tested how well the students remembered the names .
As she suspected , people more easily remembered the names that fit well .
“ The better the fit of the name to the face , the faster the participants were to learn to associate those names , ” Thomas told LiveScience .
Her results will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal Psychonomic Bulletin & Review .
Thomas next plans to study why these stereotypes exist .
Parents may , for example , name their babies to fit their general features , like the shapes of their faces .
And as for why certain names seem to accompany specific features , it could be that there is an interaction between a name ’s sound and how it ’s visually perceived , said Thomas .
For example , “ Bob is a round sounding name , and the face that was generated for that name was round , ” she said .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - More than 100 students scuffled with police and hardline supporters of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday on Tehran University campus and chanted “ Death to the dictator ” outside a hall where the Iranian president spoke .
Iranian students protest against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's visit to Tehran University October 8 , 2007 .
More than 100 students scuffled with police and hardline supporters of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Monday on Tehran University campus and chanted " Death to the dictator " outside a hall where the Iranian president spoke .

“ Revolutionary president , we support you , ” the hardline students shouted back , pushing and shoving those who were voicing opposition to Ahmadinejad , a Reuters witness said .
Liberal - minded students and academics have criticized the president for clamping down on dissent on Iranian campuses , although the president and his government insist they support free speech and welcome constructive opposition .
Monday ’s protest was the second rowdy reception Ahmadinejad has received at a university in less than a year .
In December , students tried to disrupt his speech on another campus by hurling firecrackers , chanting and burning his picture .
“ Students should feel responsible in the international arena ... Today ’s world needs them , ” state television quoted the president as telling university officials and students in the hall .
The television made no mention of disturbances outside .
One of the pro-reform students said those allowed inside to listen were handpicked because they supported the president .
“ We were not invited , ” said the student , asking not to be named .
Students and activists say some of those who have spoken out against the president and his government in the past two years have been detained or blacklisted from university courses .
Students on Monday shouted : “ Detained students should be released ” .
Ahmadinejad ’s supporters responded : “ Hypocrites , leave the university ” and waved religious banners .
The president , who polarizes opinions in Iran by berating the West and with his populist agenda , had delayed his speech from last week because he felt unwell , officials had said .
More than 100 students , who tried to leave the campus to protest , briefly scuffled with campus police who stopped them .
“ Fascist president , the university is not a place for you , ” students chanted as they marched towards the campus gates .
Other rival students , including members of the Basij religious militia , wrestled and punched each other .
GAUGING SUPPORT
Before leaving the campus , some professors gave Ahmadinejad a carpet to thank him for his speech at New York ’s Columbia University last month .
The U.S. university ’s head introduced his guest as a “ cruel dictator ” .
Ahmadinejad said this was rude .
Ahmadinejad swept to office in 2005 vowing to share out Iran ’s oil wealth fairly and a return to revolutionary ideals .
Critics say his policies have stoked inflation and his fiery speeches have provoked Western nations to impose sanctions .
In the late 1990s , students formed a bastion of support for the social and political reforms promoted by then president , Mohammad Khatami .
In 1999 , a student protest against a liberal newspaper closure was routed by baton - wielding thugs .
Many students became disillusioned as reforms failed to materialize .
Gauging popular support for Ahmadinejad is difficult in the absence of reliable opinion polls .
Anecdotal evidence suggests he has many backers in the provinces , particularly poorer areas that have benefited from state largesse .
But grumbling in the cities has become vocal .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Ahmadinejad ’s backers were trounced in local council polls in December , particularly in big urban centers like Tehran .
His supporters face a new test in the March parliamentary election .
“ I did not vote for him but I was not against him ( in the 2005 presidential vote ) .
If I was doubtful last time , I am completely sure this time that I will not vote for him , ” said a 22 - year - old Tehran University student , asking not to be named .
Iran is embroiled in a nuclear row with the West , which accuses the Islamic Republic of seeking atomic bombs .
Tehran denies the charge and has rejected demands to stop the work .
As a result of its refusal , U.N. sanctions have been imposed .
Yahya Saffarian , a student who has been suspended from his studies , told an Iranian rights group meeting this month that the government was seeking to remove opponents from campuses .
“ If education is a right , we will not give it up ... and if it is a privilege , it seems a specific group is only entitled to that , ” he said .

Revathi Massosai alleges harsh treatment in detention
Revathi Massosai , the name by which she wants to be known , says she was forced to eat beef despite being a Hindu .
Miss Massosai was seized by the Islamic authorities in January when she went to court to ask that she be registered as a Hindu rather than a Muslim .
The case is one of a number that have raised religious tensions in Malaysia .
Miss Massosai was born to Muslim converts and given a Muslim name , but she was raised as a Hindu by her grandmother and has always practised that faith .
However , under Malaysia 's Islamic law , having Muslim parents makes one a Muslim and , as such , one is not allowed to change one 's faith or marry a non-Muslim .
But Miss Massosai married a Hindu man in 2004 and the couple have a young daughter .
Headscarf
When in January she asked a court to officially designate her a Hindu she was detained and taken to an Islamic rehabilitation centre .
Only the Islamic courts can allow a Muslim legally to change faith
Her detention was twice extended to six months , during which time she says religious officials tried to make her pray as a Muslim and wear a headscarf .
However , the claim that will particularly shock Hindus is that the camp authorities tried to force her to eat beef .
A lawyer representing the Malacca state Islamic department responsible for Miss Revathi's arrest , rejected her allegations and said officials believe that she can still be persuaded to embrace Islam .
She is adamant that she will remain a Hindu .
In the meantime , Miss Revathi and her daughter have been placed in the custody of her Muslim parents .
It ’s always confusing to sports fans , and not a little disappointing , when they encounter great talents with second - rate character .
Bobby Knight is a legendary coach but a serial bully who has , on many occasions , deserved a righteous public ass - whipping .
Barry Bonds was gifted with first - ballot Hall of Fame skills , but has destroyed his reputation forever thanks to a little problem with the flaxseed oil .
And now we have Alex Rodriguez , who the other night cemented his standing as baseball ’s newest king - hell punk .
It ’s a shame , because he ’s probably the greatest player alive ( at least , the greatest player between the dates of April 1 and September 30 ) .
For those who might have forgotten , let ’s review some of A - Rod ’s more celebrated Bush League moments .
In Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS , A - Rod attempted to slap the ball out of Bronson Arroyo ’s glove on a close play at first base , something he should have known better than to do by the time he reached high school .
In a game in May against the Red Sox he came into second base hard trying to break up a double play – perfectly okay so far – but popped up on the slide and hit Sox 2B Dustin Pedroia with a cheap elbow / forearm shiver .
Bottom line , it was a dirty play that served no purpose at all , and should have earned him a 95 - mph heater in the ear next time up .
Then , later on in the same month he caused yet another uproar on an infield pop against the Blue Jay .
He was on second when the ball was hit , and as Jay ’s 3B Howie Clark settled in to make the catch A - Rod trotted along and yelled “ mine , ” making Clark think his shortstop was calling him off .
A serious no -no , and Toronto pitchers were still humming fastballs at Rodriguez weeks later .
So long A - Rod , hello Bush - Rod .
These kinds of antics , which ought to be beneath a 4th - grader on the playground , gripe the hell out of people like me .
I grew up playing hardball and still play every summer , and my credo , win or lose , is simple : Respect the Game .
I do n’t have big league talent , obviously , but there are clearly some things that I and my Denver Grizzlies teammates understand that nobody ever explained to Alex .
But as bad as these petty misdemeanors have tarnished what should be a sterling rep , the other night he and his punk agent Scott Boras topped them all by announcing , in the middle of Game 4 of the World Series , that he’d be opting out of his $ 800 billion contract with the Yankees to pursue free agency .
As ESPN ’s Buster Olney eloquently explains , whoever signs him better understand that their organization is going to be 100 % about him .
Not them .
Not winning .
Not the team .
Him .
Recall that wonderful Bud ad featuring “ Leon ” a couple years back , where the reporter says “ There ’s no ‘ I ’ in ‘ team . ' ”
Leon fires back , in supremely Bush - Rod fashion , “ ai n’t no ‘ we , ’ either . ”
It ’s now AAA - Rod : All About A - Rod .
You just do n’t put yourself ahead of the game like that .
Even if the World Series were about one guy instead of the team , that one guy would n’t be somebody sitting at home on his couch after going 4 - 15 and leading his team to yet another postseason loss in the ALDS .
The Major League office is justifiably incensed over this stunt , and Scott Boras can stick his fake apology in the same place my junior high coach used to threaten to stick his fungo if I booted one more & %$ #@ * & ground ball at short .
I mean , get a load of this :
“ I apologize to the Boston Red Sox and Colorado Rockies and their players , Major League Baseball and its players , and baseball fans everywhere for that interference , ” he said in a statement .
“ The teams and players involved deserved to be the focus of the evening and honored with the utmost respect .
The unfortunate result was not my intent , but is solely my fault .
I could have handled this situation better , and for that I am truly sorry . ”
Right .
This is like Allen Iverson apologizing for missing practice or Dick Cheney apologizing for sheepdogging a no - bid contract toward one of his hunting buddies .
Bush - Rod has now earned his way into the no-class pantheon where he sits alongside the likes of Pete Rose .
If you recall , in 2004 Rose , who was set to admit gambling on baseball so he could get his lifetime ban lifted by Commish Bud Selig , chose to upstage the Hall of Fame announcements with his book release .
This put Dennis Eckersley and Paul Molitor , two world - class acts who were incredibly deserving of the honor , in the position of having to field questions about goddamned Pete Rose , the biggest embarrassment in the game ’s recent history , instead of being able to enjoy the opportunity to bask in their accomplishments .
Up until that moment I had been open to the possibility that if Pete came clean I might support letting him back in the door .
But the Hall of Fame is ( or ought to be ) about people who respect the game , and when you piss on the door of Cooperstown like that you deserve to be banned for life .
And maybe , despite his many faults , Commish gets this , because since that moment there has n’t been a whisper about lifting Charley Hustle ’s exile .
Good .
( And by the way , a pox on the sporting “ press ” here – FOX can go to hell for actually reporting Bush - Rod ’s announcement during the game the other night , as can the reporters who had the gall to ask to Molitor and Eck about anything except Molitor and Eck . )
So congrats , AAA - Rod.
Scott Boras does n’t opt out of the kind of deal you had without knowing something , so my guess is you ’ll be signing a deal worth roughly the GDP of Western Europe here in the next couple of weeks .
You ’re still young enough that there ’s time to grow up and maybe restore some shine to your legacy , and here ’s hoping we ’ve seen the last of Bush - Rod .
I ’m not betting on it , mind you , but I ’d love to be proven wrong .
If you want us to actually cheer and feel good about it as you chase Hank Aaron ’s all - time homerun record , though , here ’s a few words of advice :
Respect the game , bitch .
CouchDb strikes a chord
Apparently the switch to JSON and Javascript is a big hit .
Jan writes a bit about the upcoming changes and suddenly CouchDb is attracting lots of attention .
Andrew Tetlaw - Watch out for CouchDb
I also dig the free - form data aspect .
In a rdbms it ’s often the case you have to be attentive to your schema design so that you can support future query requirements .
In CouchDB you just make views whenever you feel like to give you any number of different views on the same data .
Tobias Lütke - Futuretalk : CouchDB
CouchDB uses the concept of views which are essentially javascript methods .
It uses map / reduce to find matching records in its global namespace so that at query time the results are available instantaneously .
This is a huge performance boost for web applications which generally have many more queries than update / inserts .
Labnotes - CouchDB : Thinking beyond the RDBMS
Here ’s the kicker .
This simple architecture you can partition and replicate any way you want , map / reduce these computed tables on any scale , and deal with the rest on the client .
Also there are a bunch of comments on Reddit .
Here is one of my favorites :
By the by , the flurry of CouchDB articles smell remarkably like freshly mowed astroturf .
Color me suspicious .
Me too .
No way this many people get it .
If you want to know more about the design and implementation of CouchDb , read the Technical Overview .
Also , Jan has been doing a ton of work updating the documentation wiki to reflect the new changes .
Keep in mind that although you can get the source and build it yourself , the CouchDb JSON conversion is n't done yet .
The client replication logic has n't been converted to use the new JSON formats and file attachments are n't tested .
Once that 's done we 'll release the next alpha version .
In the meantime , here is the nascent Javascript based test suite and client library .
The cool thing about them is they are run directly from a web browser , making a pimped - out test suite with GUI bling and debugging hotness not only possible , but mandatory .

According to a report from a government Insider currently posted on AfterDowningStreet.org , the Anthrax attacks on Senators Daschle and Leahy in 2001 , just weeks after 9 - 11 , may have been launched not by foreign or even domestic terrorists , unless ( like Rosie O'Donnel ) you count members of the U.S. Government as potentential members such a group .
Francis A. Boyle , an international law expert who worked under the first Bush Administration as a bioweapons advisor in the 1980s , has said that he is convinced the October 2001 anthrax attacks that killed five people were perpetrated and covered up by criminal elements of the U.S. government .
The motive : to foment a police state by killing off and intimidating opposition to post - 9/11 legislation such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the later Military Commissions Act .
I admit I am wary of what might seem a bit of tin-foil habberdashery , but then again - we just had a President commute the sentence of someone who lied to protect the Vice President from possible Treason charges .
We 've seen our racial discrimination at the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ .
Just how much lower can the Bush / Cheney Government go ?
Based on what Dr. Boyle has to say it just might be that we have n't even begun to completely plumb the true depths of BushCo .
" At the time I myself did not know precisely what was going on , either with respect to September 11 or the anthrax attacks , but then the New York Times revealed the technology behind the letter to Senator Daschle .
[ The anthrax used was ] a trillion spores per gram , [ refined with ] special electro-static treatment .
This is superweapons - grade anthrax that even the United States government , in its openly proclaimed programs , had never developed before .
So it was obvious to me that this was from a U.S. government lab .
There is nowhere else you could have gotten that . "
At the time of the attacks the Senate was contempating the original version of the Patriot Act , which at the time included a complete striping of Habeas Corpus .
Senator Leahy was one of the leading opponents of the bill .
Following the attacks , much of that opposition faded and the bill - with some modifications - was passed .
Leahy even voted for it .
Boyle who had worked for years on Bioweapons and had been responsible for drafting the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism
Act of 1989 , which passed both Houses and was signed into law by George Herbert Walker Bush .
But wait , the plot sickens ...
After realizing that the type and quality of the Anthrax used against Sen .
Daschle indicated that it had to have been developed by U.S. Scientists , Boyle contacted the FBI and spoke with Agent Marion " Spike " Bowman .
Boyle and Bowman had met at a terrorism conference at the University of Michigan Law School .
Boyle told Bowman that the only people who would have the capability to carry out the attacks were individuals working on U.S. government anthrax programs with access to a high - level biosafety lab .
Boyle gave Bowman a full list of names of scientists , contractors and labs conducting anthrax work for the U.S. government and military .
Well , you 'd expect that armed with this knowledge , trusty Agent Bowman would be after his man / men immediately ?
Well , not so much .
Bowman then informed Boyle that the FBI was working with Fort Detrick on the matter .
Boyle expressed his view that Fort Detrick could be the main problem .
Fort Detrick recieves it 's cultures for bioweapon analysis and development from Ames , Iowa - but not long after these events the cultures at Ames were ordered destroyed by ... wait for it ... the FBI .
Study Indicates Diabetes Drug Avandia and Actos Double the Risk of Heart Failure
( CardiovascularWeb News )
FRIDAY , July 27 , 2007
Today , a study in Diabetes Care reported that patients taking either of the diabetes drug Avandia ( rosiglitazone )
and Actos ( pioglitazone ) have twice the risk of suffering from heart failure than people not on the drugs .
Both drugs are prescribed for type 2 diabetes and belong to the same family of drugs known as
thiazolidinediones .
This study1 is led by Dr. Sonal Singh of Wake Forest University in North Carolina .
In this report , a
meta - analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials showed a 2.1 times higher risk for patients to have heart failure
in patients on thiazolidinediones .
Avandia ( GlaxoSmithKline ) and Actos ( Takeda ) decrease insulin resistance suffered by type 2 diabetic patients
by binding and activating the peroxisome proliferators - activated receptor ( PPARs ) located on the cell nucleus
membrane .
The activation of PPARs leads to the production of insulin dependent enzyme and thus more
efficient use of glucose in patients .
However , there is now a concern that these drugs may increase the rate of
heart failure .
The Food and Drug Administration will be holding a review with outside experts on July 30 to determine the
safety of the drugs and whether any of the drugs should be pulled from the market .

Top 10 : Movie Roles That Never Happened
Page 1 of 3
Watching movies is always a fun pastime , but it becomes even more enjoyable when you imagine different actors in certain film roles .
Come on ; do n't tell me you never envisioned how Pulp Fiction would have turned out had Pauly Shore been cast as Marsellus Wallace .
For this article , I went even further by actually rummaging through film history to find out which actors and actresses were considered for classic movie roles .
You definitely wo n't believe some of the choices that were almost made .
Before checking out the top 10 roles that never happened , be aware of the following criteria :
The actor may have turned down the role , or he may have been passed up for it ;
The movie must have been commercially successful .
Number 10
Will Smith as Neo , The Matrix
Number 9
Jack Nicholson as Michael Corleone , The Godfather
Number 8
Robert Redford as Benjamin Braddock , The Graduate
So let 's find out which celebrities made career - altering decisions , and which ones were simply unlucky .
Roll it !
If there 's one movie that totally revolutionized the film industry in recent years , it 's definitely ( 1999 ) .
At the time , Will Smith was quickly becoming one of America 's favorite movie stars , and as a result , he was offered the lead role of Neo .
However , the Fresh Prince did n't want to be part of some obscure , relatively low - budget science - fiction film that would surely not be box - office gold .
He turned down that offer to do the sci- fi comedy ( 1999 ) instead , and the latter became one of the biggest disappointments in Hollywood .
In a neat little twist of fate , Smith 's wife Jada Pinkett Smith was offered a pretty sizable role in the twosequels .
took the job .
At least someone in the family got to get jiggy in bullet time !
Ask any movie critic to list the most influential American films in history , and the gangster saga ( 1972 ) will undoubtedly appear in the Top 10 .
While casting for the film , Paramount thought the movie was a risky venture and was angling for an established star to be hired as the lead .
Jack Nicholson was offered the part , along with Warren Beatty , Robert Redford , Ryan O'Neal , and Dustin Hoffman , but they all declined .
The character of Michael Corleone ultimately became an American icon because of Al Pacino 's chilling and introspective performance .
Although Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time , the Godfather yelling " Heeeere 's Johnny ! " does n't seem too believable ... Another job that Robert Redford turned down was for the influential 1967 motion picture .
The role of Benjamin Braddock called for a young man who is uncertain about his future and becomes embroiled in an affair with Mrs. Robinson , the resident MILF .
Robert Redford liked the script and even went as far as doing a screen test .
But in the end , Redford was too much of a movie star .
Self - assured , cool and handsome , he and director Mike Nichols both came to the conclusion that a more innocent - looking actor would be better suited for the role .
After all , Redford would 've probably resolved the situation with a $ 1 million indecent proposal .

The Windscale piles provided material for nuclear weapons
In 1957 , a fire at the Windscale nuclear reactor in Cumbria led to a release of radioactive material that spread across the UK and Europe .
But new research claims the incident generated twice as much radioactive material and could have caused more cancers than was previously thought .
The research was published in the journal Atmospheric Environment .
Risky act
The Windscale site was home to Britain 's first two nuclear reactors - the Windscale Piles - which were constructed to produce plutonium and other materials for the UK 's nuclear weapons programme .
But the rush to build them when little was known about nuclear reactors led to what was at the time the world 's biggest nuclear disaster , although it was later dwarfed by Chernobyl and Three Mile Island .
Graphite overheated and fire broke out Air from fan fuelled fire Nuclear contaminants travelled up chimney Filter blocked some but not all contaminated material Radioactive cloud spread over UK and Europe
Windscale : A nuclear disaster
On 10 October 1957 , a failure to properly control the temperature of the graphite moderator within the Windscale No 1 pile sparked a devastating fire , which caused radioactive contamination to spew into the atmosphere .
The fire was eventually put out by restricting the air flow , and with water - a risky act which could have caused an explosion - but a radioactive cloud was already spreading far and wide .
At the time of the accident the levels and spread of the radioactive materials was estimated , and measures were put in place to limit radioactive contamination .
But a new study carried out by John Garland , formerly of the UK Atomic Energy Authority , and Richard Wakeford , a visiting professor at the University of Manchester , suggests the contamination of the environment may have been much higher .
The team carried out a re-analysis of data taken from environmental monitoring of air , grass and vegetation and combined this with computer models that revealed how the radioactive cloud would have spread from the reactor with the meteorological conditions at that time .
They confirmed radioactive iodine and caesium were released , as well as polonium and a very small amount of plutonium , but found that the levels would have been higher than previously thought .
John Garland said : " The reassessments showed that there was roughly twice the amount than was initially assessed . "
This would have also impacted the numbers of cancers that the accident would have caused , said the authors .
Previously , it was thought that the radiation would have eventually led to about 200 cases of cancer , but the new contamination figures suggest it could have caused about 240 .
The researchers said most of the radioactive materials released had now decayed and posed no ongoing risk , but small quantities of caesium and plutonium remained .
Paul Howarth , director of research at the Dalton Nuclear Institute at Manchester University , said a repeat of the Windscale incident would not happen today because the design of modern nuclear reactors was completely different .
A wild idea is one that many people think is obviously quite unlikely .
I 'd say at least a third of these wild ideas are likely true .

With triple - decker bunk - beds stacked from floor to ceiling , it looks a cross between a school dormitory and the sleeping quarters on a troop ship .
But thrifty fliers take note .
German airline Lufthansa is considering introducing just such an economy sleeper cabin on its long - haul flights .
It would , for the first time , offer economy - class passengers a bed rather than a seat for a more comfortable ride .
The triple decker bunks are set out in the herring - bone pattern of a kipper - designed to give the maximum number of passengers the chance of a kip .
Scroll down for more
The fly - and - lie " kipper class " service is likely to take place first on the giant Airbus A380 , giving budget fliers the chance of a horizontal snooze that , until now , is the preserve of business and First class fliers .
But it could be adapted to most long - haul aircraft .
Details of the idea - which would radically alter intercontinental travel - emerged yesterday as the airline hailed encouraging feedback from customers quizzed in an online poll .
Lufthansa spokeswoman Amelie Lorenz said : " We are going to analyse the results of the survey and then we will decide whether to proceed or not .
But the first results have been very positive . "
Most airlines already provide flat bed seats on their long - range routes , but only for first - and business - class customers .
Economy - class passengers have had to settle for being packed into tightly regimented reclining seats for extended periods of travel , which have been blamed for causing potentially fatal blood clots known as deep - vein thrombosis , or DVT , in susceptible individuals .
Until now , airlines have been reluctant to introduce fully reclining seats in economy class because they require more space .
This reduces the number of passengers and decreases profit for the carriers .
But by stacking beds one on top of another , the airline can make use of the normally unused space in the cabin above fliers .
Lufthansa revealed computer - generated pictures of its triple - decker bunk beds as part of a customer survey it conducted among selected customers to see if the idea had wings .
The official picture , which the airline was nevertheless reluctant to release , features a layout of berths stacked three - high in diagonal rows - herringbone - style - along the sides of the plane .
There are two additional rows bunked berths at the centre of a wide central aisle .
The high - density bunk - beds would allow the airline to accommodate enough passengers , while still providing them with the luxury of a good night 's sleep on an overnight flight , without having to charge them a £ 3,000 price tag .
Miss Lorenz noted that the proposed layout - which appeared to represent the lower deck of the twin - level Airbus A380 - was just one of those under consideration .
If the airline decides to go ahead with the proposed sleeper cabin , the best option will be selected , she said .
The A380 - the world 's largest airliner - will fly on Lufthansa 's ultra-long haul flights , including those from Germany to North America , South Africa , the Far East and Australia .
It has already flown long - haul , staffed with a full Lufthansa crew and VIP passengers , to Hong Kong and the United States .
If the new " kipper class " idea is adopted , the airline would have to fine - tune how the beds would be adjusted to enable passengers to eat meals - and how the cabin would be configured for take off and landing .
But Lufthansa suggested it was ready for the challenge .
The bunk beds would be transformed from seats after take off and would cost around £ 120 more than a flexible economy fare .
They would be linked to the flight entertainment system but would be unlikely to include a meal service , other than a light snack and bottled water from the buffet , because passengers booking them would be anxious to get their heads down to sleep as quickly as possible .
The bunk beds would have to be approved by the international safety authorities , who would consider ease of evacuation in an emergency .
Business travellers on passenger websites have broadly welcomed Lufthansa 's bunk bed idea .
One passenger noted : " The prospect of being able to get a decent night 's sleep on a flight without having to fork out a four figure sum would be a monumental step forward for air travel . "
Another said : " I think that it could prove very popular with business travellers whose companies are too stingy to let them fly business class .
Even with the £ 120 surcharge , this should still be within the range of all but the most draconian corporate travel policies . "
Miss Lorenz said : " This is part of an innovation process within our airline .
It is part of our normal product development . "
Sir Richard Branson 's Virgin Atlantic will be the first UK airline to take delivery of the A380 superjumbo and has already expressed an interest in putting beds into its planes .
Sir Richard even went as far as suggesting it could have private cabins costing from £ 2,000 which he dubbed " the Mile High Club . "
Three years ago he said : " It has been one of my long held ambitions to have double beds onboard our aircraft and now , once again , we are leading the way in product innovation onboard our aircraft . "
British Airways has yet to commit to buying any A380s .
More than a decade ago some aircraft engineers came up with the idea of sleeping capsules on planes , similar to the capsule hotels in Japan .
Critics of the war in Iraq who compare the conflict to Vietnam have the analogy backward , President Bush plans to tell veterans in a speech today .
In what the White House is billing as a major foreign policy address , the president will say that the lessons of Vietnam teach that the U.S. should stay in Iraq , not withdraw .
Terrorists cite Vietnam to predict that the United States will run from the Iraq war , he will say .
“ Here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility -- but the terrorists see things differently , ” Bush plans to tell a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention , according to speech excerpts released late Tuesday by the White House .
Bush will argue that the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam had dire consequences for the people in that region and so would a withdrawal from Iraq .

“ Three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left , ” Bush will say .
“ Whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America ’s withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ‘ boat people , ’ ‘ re - education camps , ’ and ‘ killing fields . ’ ”
The release of the lengthy excerpts was an unusual move by the White House , which rarely provides advance text of presidential addresses .
It was also unusual because Bush has tended to steer clear of analogies to Vietnam , widely considered an unwinnable quagmire that critics have increasingly compared to the Iraq war .
White House counselor Ed Gillespie said today ’s speech would be the first of two designed to lay the rhetorical groundwork for a mid-September progress report Congress had demanded as part of the debate over whether and how to continue funding military operations in Iraq .
“ As we face challenges in Iraq today , we do so knowing we have done this kind of transformative work before , and the benefits to America made the sacrifices worthwhile , ” Gillespie said in a statement explaining the early release of the speech excerpts .

Today ’s speech will stress how the U.S. “ perseverance in Asia led to a freer , more stable , and more prosperous continent , ” Gillespie said .
On Tuesday , in a speech to the American Legion , the president is to address the importance of Iraq to the future of the Middle East .
White House officials were traveling with the president from Canada to Kansas City , Mo. , and were not available for comment .
In today ’s speech , Bush will compare the occupation of Iraq to that of Japan after World War II and the continued defense of South Korea , arguing that they are similar “ ideological struggles . ”
He will say that the U.S. presence in Iraq will help bring democracy and prosperity to the Middle East , as it did in Asia .
“ Prevailing in this struggle is essential to our future as a nation , ” the president will argue , according to the excerpts .
“ The question now before us comes down to this : Will today ’s generation of Americans resist the deceptive allure of retreat -- and do in the Middle East what veterans in this room did in Asia ? ”

Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. ( D - Del. ) , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , criticized Bush ’s speech , saying the president “ continues to play the American people for fools . ”
“ The only relevant analogy of Vietnam to Iraq is this :
In Iraq , just as we did in Vietnam , we are clinging to a central government that does not and will not enjoy the support of the people , ” he said .
“ Unless the president acts on that lesson from history and works toward a federal solution in Iraq , there is no prospect that when we leave , we will leave anything stable behind .
“ In fact , the president ’s policies are pushing us toward another Saigon moment -- with helicopters fleeing the roof of our embassy -- which he says he wants to avoid .
“ Al Qaeda in Iraq did n’t exist before we invaded .
It is a Bush fulfilling prophecy , ” he added .

Historian Robert Dallek , who has written about the comparisons of Iraq to Vietnam , accused Bush of twisting history .
“ It just boggles my mind , the distortions I feel are perpetrated here by the president , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ We were in Vietnam for 10 years .
We dropped more bombs on Vietnam than we did in all of World War II in every theater .
We lost 58,700 American lives , the second - greatest loss of lives in a foreign conflict .
And we could n’t work our will , ” he said .
“ What is Bush suggesting ?
That we did n’t fight hard enough , stay long enough ?
That ’s nonsense .
It ’s a distortion , ” he continued .
“ We ’ve been in Iraq longer than we fought in World War II .
It ’s a disaster , and this is a political attempt to lay the blame for the disaster on his opponents .
But the disaster is the consequence of going in , not getting out . ”
Bush has long compared the Iraq war to World War II .
In a 2004 speech at the Air Force Academy , he said , “ Like other totalitarian movements , the terrorists seek to impose a grim vision in which dissent is crushed , and every man and woman must think and live in colorless conformity . ”

Bush has usually sidestepped comparisons of Iraq and Vietnam .
When he has mentioned Vietnam , he usually emphasizes that the conflicts are dissimilar .

Reynolds reported from Washington , Gerstenzang from Kansas City , Mo. , and Montebello , Canada .
Now that Idaho Senator Larry Craig has finally been discovered hiding in his closet , it ’s becoming more and more obvious that there ’s a segment of the Republican Party whose main motivation in politics appears to be making laws that are an attempt to keep themselves from their particular dysfunctional behaviors .
We saw it with Mark Foley , who actually introduced legislation to punish the kind of behavior he engaged in .
And strongly anti-gay Republicans like Ed Schrock and Jim West have supported and even pushed anti-gay legislation as they sat quietly in their closets .
As David Kurtz points out here , a website for the Idaho Values Alliance contains a remarkably familiar warning about what homosexuals do underneath a picture of family values champion Senator Craig ( emphasis mine ) :
One of the tragic characteristics of the homosexual lifestyle is its emphasis on anonymous sex and multiple sexual partners .
It is a little - acknowledged secret that many active homosexuals will have more than 1,000 sex partners over the course of a lifetime ( the average among heterosexuals is seven – still six more than we were designed for ) .
This sordid fact of homosexual life surfaced yesterday in an AP article yesterday that reports on the number of arrests police have made for indecent exposure and public sex acts in the restrooms at Atlanta ’s airport , the busiest in the world .
The increased restroom patrols , begun to apprehend luggage thieves , instead uncovered a rash of sex crimes .
Airport restrooms have become so popular that men looking for anonymous sexual trysts with other men have advertised their airport availability on Craigslist .
One such ad was from a man saying he was stuck at the airport for three hours and was looking for “ discreet , quick action . ”
You just ca n’t make this stuff up .
In its miniseries about the missteps that led to 9/11 , ABC spared not only Bill Clinton but also George W. Bush .
Our hawkish War President had almost nine months to respond to the USS Cole attack and did nothing , even as his security staff fired off memo after memo fingering Osama bin Laden and urging retaliation .
Clinton claims , feebly , that he did n’t have enough evidence to pin the October 2000 attack on bin Laden .
But Bush certainly did .
On March 2 , 2001 , then - senior White House counterterrorism official Roger Cressey sent a memo to then - National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice relaying intelligence that bin Laden had gloated about the attack on the Cole in a poem he read at his son ’s wedding .
“ BIN LADEN on the USS COLE ” was the title of the urgent memo .
But Rice could n’t be bothered with stuff that happened on Clinton ’s watch .
Undeterred , Cressey a few weeks later followed up with Rice ’s deputy Steve Hadley .
He wrote , “ We know all we need to about who did the attack to make a policy decision . ”
His March 22 email  written under the heading , “ Need for Terrorism DC Next Week ”  fell on deaf ears .
Two days later , White House terror czar Richard Clarke weighed in on the subject .
He wrote both Rice and Hadley that the Yemeni prime minister had told the State Department that while Yemen was not saying so publicly , Yemen was 99 percent certain that bin Laden was responsible for the Cole attack .
His March 24 memo , “ Yemen ’s View on the USS Cole , ” only elicited more yawns from Bush ’s top security aides .
By the summer , Clarke finally had the iron - clad proof he needed to convince Rice and the president to take action against bin Laden .
On June 21  less than three months before the 9 - 11 attacks 
Clarke fired off another memo to Rice and Hadley alerting them that a new al - Qaeda video claimed responsibility for the Cole .
His memo could n’t have been more plain : “ Al Qida[sic ] Video Claims Responsibility for Cole Attack . ”
More yawns .
Later that month , two Saudi jihadists arrested by Bahraini authorities during the summer threat spike told their captors that their al - Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan had held celebratory parties over the Cole attack .
By now , Clarke ’s hair was on fire .
He dashed off another memo to Rice on June 29 .
Rice again did nothing  except demote Clarke , that is .
Why were Bush ’s neocon security advisers so insouciant about terrorism ?
They were still fighting the last war .
Obsessed over Russia , China , Iraq and missile defense , the cold warriors refused to give an audience to the career White House security experts who presciently warned about the new greater threat from al - Qaeda terrorists .
The White House before 9/11 held some 100 Cabinet meetings on Iraq , Russia , missile defense and other Bush - 41 hobbyhorses , and only one on terrorism .
Rice insists al - Qaeda was priority No. 1 , but a speech she ’d planned to deliver on Sept. 11 , 2001 , contained no mention of al - Qaeda , Osama bin Laden or Islamic terrorists .
The focus of the policy speech , before the neocon School for Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University , was missile defense , and not of the passenger airliner variety .
In fact , Rice overlooked al - Qaeda in every public speech she made between Jan. 20 , 2001 , and Sept. 11 , 2001 , a Nexis search reveals .
Even stretching all the way back to early 1993 , when the World Trade Center was first hit , Rice mentions al - Qaeda not a single time in any speech , article or media interview .
By comparison , she cites Iraq more than 1,000 times from 1993 to 2001 .
And the same misguided set of priorities were in place over at the Pentagon in the run-up to 9/11 .
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his neoconspirators were just as stuck in the Cold War .
Al - Qaeda hardly registered on their radar screen , either  even though the attack on the Cole was arguably an act of war .
Al - Qaeda killed 17 U.S. sailors and injured more than 30 while nearly sinking a Navy destroyer anchored in the port of Aden , Yemen .
Yet there was no response from the Pentagon at all .
“ Secretary Rumsfeld did not order the preparation of any new military plans against either al - Qaeda or the Taliban before 9/11 , ” states a staff report released by the 9/11 Commission in 2004 .
Zero. Zip. Nada .
Rummy apparently was too busy drawing up plans to invade Iraq .
When Bush stepped into office , he clearly had learned nothing from the previous administration ’s grave mistake of underestimating bin Laden , attack after bigger terror attack .
Nor did he learn anything from his own mistake of blowing him off after the Cole .
Bush now crows about taking out “ the mastermind of the USS Cole bombing who was the chief of al - Qaeda ’s operations in the Persian Gulf . ”
That would be Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , captured in 2002  only after the 9 - 11 attacks .
Again , Bush is fighting the last war , always one step behind .
If he had focused on bin Laden and al - Qaeda as the career White House security experts were pleading for him to do before 9 - 11 , if he had retaliated for the brazen attack on a U.S. warship by an enemy that had already declared war on us , perhaps 9 - 11 could have been diverted .
Even after 9/11 , Bush did n’t go after bin Laden hard enough .
He let him live another day  1,830 days to be exact .
He ’s failed to decapitated the al - Qaeda leadership , because he got distracted once again fighting a previous war  in this case his daddy’s .
And in doing so he ’s only played right into his hands of bin Laden , who is making great hay of the “ crusaders ” attacking and occupying ( admittedly , for no good reason ) the seat of the old Islamic caliphate .
If a President Gore had attacked the wrong country and blown off bin Laden for another five years , we ’d never hear the end of it from Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and the rest of the Koolaid crowd .
Or from me .
Yet President Bush gets a pass ?
“ Patriots , ” my ass .
オープンソースコミュニティ運営方法
Google Videoに 「 How Open Source Projects Survive Poisonous People ( And You Can Too ) 」 という54分のビデオがありました。 Subversionの開発者達が、オープンソースプロジェクトを運営上の注意点を解説していました。 面白かったです。
ボランティア開発者の集合体によって実現しているオープンソースプロジェクトを運営する方法を解説するという題目ですが、
最後のオチでは、「これはオープンソースに限らない」と言っていました。
確かに、一般的な開発でも参考になる部分は多いと思いました。
また、掲示板やブログのコメント欄でも一部は適用できそうなノウハウであると思いました。
要約してみましたが、結構いい加減で間違いなどがあると思うので詳細はビデオをご覧下さい。
「 Poisonous People 」 は 「 有害な人」と訳してみました。
概要
最初に、これは唯一の方法ではなく、私達の方法です。
プロジェクトを有害な人から守る４つのステップ
comprehension : 有害なのは誰か、どんな人か、守るものは何か
fortification : 有害な人は引き付けない
identification : 誰がそうか
disinfection : どうやって追い出すか
comprehension
大事なのはリソース。時間など。
コミュニティが大事 それを守りたい 感情的になってコミュニティのやる気を削ぐ人 無駄な争いを起こす人 何かをしようとしても、足をひっぱったり、間違った方向に導こうとする
狙ってこれをする人もいれば、うっかりやってしまうひともいる。
自分では気が付かずにやっている人がいる。 むしろそのほうが多い。 あまりにそのプロジェクトが大好きで良くしたい
でも、結局は痛めつけているだけになる 完璧にやりたいと思っている
「 完璧が良品の敵になるべきでは な い( The perfect must not be the enemy of the good ) 。 subversion projectではそれが標語になっている デザインドキュメントに完璧を求めすぎる人がいて、コードを書き始められなかった

何を目指しているかと、スコープを区切って明確にする事が大事
subversionの場合は 、「 To create a compelling replacement for CVS 」
6年やった あれもこれもやりたいという人がいた 何をしたいか 、CVS の問題点は何かをまず列挙した
ToDo Listを作った 新しい提案が出てきても、リストを眺めて 、ToDoになければ 、 「 1.0以降にもう一度来てください」と言った
新しくやって来る開発者と常にコミュニケーションをとらないといけない。
その開発者と方向性があうなら最高だ、でも、あわなそうならばお互いの時間を節約しよう(バイバイ ) 。
google web toolkitの場合は、scope を最初に明確にしようといった。 ボランティアの開発者達を 「 work with you but not against you 」な状態にしないといけない。 google web toolkitのscopeは 「 no compermise AJAX development environment in JAVA in a modern browser 」にした。 やること、やりたくないことの範囲を明確にすることが大事。
IRCとかIMがあるけど、ほとんどの議論はメーリングリストで行われる。
途中から来た人がメールアーカイブを読んでいないと意味が無い。
途中から来た人が、前提を読まないとみんなの時間を浪費してしまう。
それは途中から来た人が前からいる皆に対するdisrespectなので、それを発生させてはいけない。
議論をしていると、自分に反対する全てのメールに全て個別にリプライする人が出てくる。
５０個ぐらいのメールの半分が特定の個人という事もある。 馬鹿馬鹿しい。 自分で出すresponseは一つにまとめろと言うことにしている。
ざっと読んでいると、反対する人が多いなぁという印象を持つかも知れないが、実は一人だったりする。
ドキュメンテーションは重要だ

ドキュメンテーションをしないと。。。 同じ事を、何度も何度も何度も何度も何度も何度も何度も何度も何度も、繰り返すことになる
code collaboration
commit e-mail はbest way to realize what others are doing code reviewをメンバーがするきっかけになる commit e-mailは重 要
開発者が人知れず３ヶ月ぐらいこっそりと巨大な機能を作りこんで、ある日突然commitするような事を許してはいけない
あまりに巨大すぎると誰もレビューできない 皆がやるきをなくしてしまう 一人しかわからなくなってしまう branchを恐れてはいけない
開発者がいきなりいなくなることがある コメントがコード中に十分に書かれている事を確認するようにしている
一人で書いているときには、一緒に書いて手伝ってくれる人を募った
開発者に子供が生まれるかもしれない 開発者が転職するかも知れない 人生で色々転機がくるかもしれない ボランティアなので、些細なことでも開発者が離れてしまう可能性がある
誰か、特定の人がコードの特定の場所を「所有」してしまわないようにする
特定の事柄のエキスパートになるのは良い
でも、企業やオープンソースプロジェクトでよくあるのが、段々と特定の個人がテリトリーを主張しだしてしまうこと

Donald Ross , a poultry worker in Virginia , nicked his finger one day on the job .
The subsequent infection ballooned into a lesion so unresponsive to antibiotics that it had to be surgically removed , according to a report in the Baltimore Sun .
Poultry workers spend their days feeding birds , transporting and weighing them , and then hanging them on hooks , slaughtering , and packing them .
Often they do not wear gloves or protective clothing while they do this messy work , and bird feathers and bits of fecal matter can piggyback on their clothes and shoes .
Chances are they bring home dangerous bacteria , the kinds that are resistant to antibiotic treatment .
An estimated 70 percent of all antibiotics sold in the United States — more than 24 million pounds every year — are used on farms , mostly in animal feed .
Health researchers have long worried that this heavy load of antibiotics is causing strains of bacteria to evolve that are impervious to the drugs .
Farmers have justified their practice on the grounds that antibiotics help fatten up the birds , thereby increasing profits .
But a groundbreaking study by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health pulls the rug out from under this argument .
Using data collected by Perdue poultry farms , Hopkins researchers calculated that Perdue lost $ .0093 per broiler chicken when using antibiotics .
For each dollar spent on antibiotic feed additives , the return was less than 10 cents .
“ We were surprised to find no measurable benefit and actually a business loss , ” says Ellen Silbergeld , professor of environmental health sciences at Johns Hopkins and one of the authors of the study .
Julie DeYoung , vice president for corporate communications at Perdue , claims the data that Johns Hopkins examined were not designed to evaluate the economics of antibiotic use .
At the very least , though , the Hopkins study establishes that feeding antibiotics to chickens in low , uncontrolled doses provides no clear economic benefit .

So how did the poultry industry get hooked on drugs that are dangerous to the health of both humans and companies ?
Blame an overreliance on conventional wisdom .
In some studies from the 1950s , animals were found to gain more weight faster when given low doses of antibiotics in their feed .
It is highly likely that other factors , like improved breeding , management , and feed formulation , also played a role in spurring the growth of poultry .
Nevertheless , the vast majority of antibiotics used on farms today are added to animal feed solely to stimulate growth .
The consequences are clear .
The FDA estimates that about 70 percent of all infection - causing bacteria have become resistant to at least one of the drugs most commonly used to treat infections .
Bacitracin , erythromycin , neomycin , streptomycin , tetracycline , and more than 10 other antibiotics , representing all the major classes of clinically important therapies commonly used in human medicine , are approved by the FDA for use in chickens and turkeys .
Quinupristin - ­dalfopristin was licensed for use on farms in advance of clinical approval .
The result was that resistance to the drug emerged even before it could be used to fight infectious disease in human beings .
The story gets worse .
Bacteria share DNA with other organisms with which they come into contact , so an antibiotic - resistant gene can transfer from one type of bacterium to another , and a bacterial cell can become resistant to numerous antibiotics at once .
Employees in the poultry industry typically work without protective equipment in dusty spaces crowded with thousands of birds ; heavy antibiotic use in those conditions creates a paradise for the emergence and spread of these multiantibiotic - resistant bacteria .
Poultry are already a leading source of Salmonella and Campylobacter infections in humans .
If a person ingests chicken contaminated with Salmonella that is resistant to ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin , not only will the Salmonella itself be difficult to treat , it will share its resistance with other bacteria in a person ’s body .
If the same person later comes down with strep throat , ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin may be ineffective to treat it .
Resistance to antibiotic cures for Campylobacter , Salmonella , and other food - borne pathogens is increasing .
Untreatable strains of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus aureus in intensive care units are also on the rise .
Over one five - year period in the 1990s , the rate of penicillin resistance increased by 300 percent , while cefotaxime resistance grew by more than 1,000 percent .
The annual cost of antimicrobial resistance in Staphylococcus alone has been estimated at $ 122 million .
Unsafe for humans , a drain on health - care resources , and not even profitable :
It ’s time for companies like Perdue to kick the antibiotic habit so we can all be better off .

それでは、いってみましょう。
予備知識 ：
Make言語には算術演算がない
さて、今話題の（って、そんなこたぁねーよ）プログラミング言語Makeですが、豊富な（って、ホントかぁ？）文字列処理関数を備えていますが、なぜか算術演算がありません。足し算もできません。でも大丈夫、足し算くらいすぐに実装できますよ（って、ホントかぁ？）。
最初に老婆心から言っておきますが、すぐさまホントに足し算が欲しいなら、次の不粋な方法が現実的かと思います。
add = $ ( shell expr $ ( 1 ) + $ ( 2 ) )
タリー表現による足し 算
自然数（0以上の整数）を次のように表現しましょう； 0 は " " （空文字列 ） 、 1 は " I " 、 2 は " II " 、3 は " III " … ローマ数字*1と似てます。が、I（大文字アイ）以外は使わないので、100はIを100個並べます。分かりやすくていいですね :-)
このような超素朴な数表記はタリー（tally；札、勘定）表現と呼びます。タリー表現をベースとするなら、Make言語による足し算は実に簡単です。
add = $ ( 1 ) $ ( 2 )
10 進タリー表現
タリー表現はいくらなんでもヒドイので、0から9まではタリー表現としたうえで、通常の10進記数法を採用しましょう。例えば、253は"
II IIIII III " とします。桁と桁のあいだは空白を入れます。ただし、これだと2503でも" II IIIII III " になってしまうので、0を表す文字O（大文字オー）を導入して、2503
は" II IIIII O III " としましょう 。
10進タリー表現は、数字（digit）の形は違うものの、日常使ってる数表現とまったく同じです。その計算は、小学校で習ったあの方法を愚直に再現すればいいですね（後でそれをやるよ）。
制御構造の強化 -- foldr
foreachだけだと制御構造（高階関数）がどうも足りない感じ、foldが欲しいところ。再帰でユーザー定義するなら、foldlよりfoldrのほうが簡単なのでfoldrを作りましょう。
Make言語で書く前 にLisp（つっても 、Emacs Lispだが）で示しておくと：
( defun foldr ( fun acc lis )
( if ( null lis ) acc
( funcall fun ( car lis ) ( foldr fun acc ( cdr lis ) ) ) ) )
( foldr ( lambda ( elm acc )
( princ ( format " %d
" elm ) )
(+ acc elm ) )
0 '( 1 2 3 4 5 ) )
5
4
3
2
1
15
実行例で、5から1はprincによる表示で、最後の15は計算結果です。
Lispのnull , cdrに対応す るMake関数empty , butfirstを定義したうえで、foldr のMake版を書きます。（横長でスミマセン、改行を不用意に入れられないので。）
empty = $ ( if $ ( strip $ ( 1 ) ) , , T )
butfirst = $ ( wordlist 2 , $ ( words $ ( 1 ) ) , $ ( 1 ) ) foldr = \
$ ( if $ ( call empty , $ ( 3 ) ) , $ ( 2 ) , $ ( call $ ( 1 ) , $( firstword $ ( 3 ) ) , $( call foldr , $ ( 1 ) , $ ( 2 ) , $( call butfirst , $ ( 3 ) ) ) ) )
foldrを使うと、reverseは次のように書けます。
swap = $ ( 2 ) $ (1 )
reverse = $ ( call foldr , swap , , $ ( 1 ) )
$ make -f rev.mk
X='a b c d '
reverse X= ' d c b a '
出力の先頭に余分な空白が付きますが大目に見てね。
リスト処理による10進数の足し算
足し算のハナシに戻ります。
まず、1桁の足し算は文字列連接で出来ます。0を表すO（オー）の処理が必要ですが、たいしたことはありません。複数桁の足し算は、各桁ごとの足し算をします。10を越えてしまった桁にはフラグを立てて、繰り上がり処理をします。この繰り上がり処理のとき、foldrにより右から順に桁を見ていくことにします。
アイディアを示すため、まずはLispで書いてみます。ただし、各桁は、タリー表現ではなくて普通の整数を使います。
( defun foldr ( fun acc lis )
( if ( null lis ) acc
( funcall fun ( car lis ) ( foldr fun acc ( cdr lis ) ) ) ) ) ( defun n- times ( n x )
( cond
(( >= 0 n ) nil )
( (= 1 n ) ( list x ) )
(t ( cons x ( n - times ( 1- n ) x ) ) ) ) ) ( defun adjust - first ( first second )
( let ( (d (- ( length second ) ( length first ) ) ) )
( if ( < = d 0 ) first
( append ( n - times d 0 ) first ) ) ) ) ( defun adjust - second ( first second )
( let ( (d (- ( length first ) ( length second ) ) ) )
( if ( < = d 0 ) second
( append ( n - times d 0 ) second ) ) ) ) ( defun join - add ( numlis1 numlis2 )
( cond
( ( null numlis1 ) numlis2 )
( ( null numlis2 ) numlis1 )
(t ( cons (+ ( car numlis1 ) ( car numlis2 ) )
( join - add ( cdr numlis1 ) ( cdr numlis2 ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defun naive - add ( numlis1 numlis2 )
( join - add
( adjust - first numlis1 numlis2 )
( adjust - second numlis1 numlis2 ) ) ) ( defun process - carry ( num numlis )
( if ( eq ' X ( car numlis ) )
( process - carry - sub ( 1+ num ) ( cdr numlis ) )
( process - carry - sub num numlis ) ) ) ( defun process - carry - sub ( num numlis )
( if ( >= num 10 )
( cons 'X ( cons ( - num 10 ) numlis ) )
( cons num numlis ) ) ) ( defun normalize ( numlist )
( foldr ( function process - carry ) '( ) numlist ) ) ( defun process - last - carry ( numlis )
( if ( eq ' X ( car numlis ) ) ( cons 1 ( cdr numlis ) )
numlis ) ) ( defun add ( numlis1 numlis2 )
( process - last - carry ( normalize ( naive - add numlis1 numlis2 ) ) ) )
計算例：
( add ' ( 1 ) ' ( 1 ) )
(2)
( add ' ( 2 0 5 ) ' ( 2 0 ) )
( 2 2 5 )
( add ' ( 7 5 ) ' ( 3 5 ) )
( 1 1 0 )
( add ' ( 9 8 2 ) ' ( 5 9 ) )
( 1 0 4 1 )
繰り上がり処理をしない足し算はnaive-addという関数、最上位桁以外の繰り上がり処理はnormalizeという関数です。
( naive - add ' ( 9 8 2 ) ' ( 5 9 ) )
( 9 13 11 )
( normalize ' ( 9 13 11 ) )
( X 0 4 1 )
( process - last - carry ' ( X 0 4 1 ) )
( 1 0 4 1 )
Make言語による足し算
以下 にMake言語による足し算を示します。基本的な流れはLispコードと同様です（細部は異なりますが）。通常の10進数と、内部表現である10進タリー表現との相互変換が入ります。
Lisp とMakeの関数対応表：
Lisp関数 Make関数 adjust - first adjust_first adjust - second adjust_second join - add join ( 組み込み ) naive - add naive_add - shrink - remainder process - carry process_carry process - carry - sub process_carry_sub normalize normalize process - last - carry - add add

足し算はできたので、残りの算術演算もチョイチョイだよ。けど、なぜか掛け算をやる気力がまったく湧かない。

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_W._Bussard&oldid=88288804
From Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia
Robert W. Bussard
Robert W. Bussard is an American physicist working primarily in nuclear fusion energy research .
In 1960 , Bussard famously conceived the Bussard ramjet , an interstellar space drive powered by hydrogen fusion using hydrogen collected using a magnetic field from the interstellar gas .
Due to the presence of high - energy particles throughout space , most interstellar hydrogen exists in an ionized state that can be manipulated by magnetic or electric fields .
Bussard proposed using a large magnet to " scoop " up the ionized hydrogen and funnel it into a fusion reactor , using the exhaust from the reactor as a rocket engine .
Since it picked up its fuel from space , there was no apparent upper limit to the speed such a craft could achieve .
However it appears the " energy gain " in the reactor must be extremely high for the ramjet to work at all ; any hydrogen picked up by the scoop must be sped up to the same speed as the ship in order to provide thrust , and the energy required to do so increases with the ship 's speed .
In the early 1970s , Bussard joined the director of the , then , Atomic Energy Commission 's Controlled Thermonuclear Reaction Division , Robert Hirsch , as Assistant Director .
They founded the mainline fusion program for the United States : the Tokamak .
Later , Bussard in a June 6 , 1995 letter to all fusion laboratories as well as to key members of US Congress regarding his role in the founding of the US fusion program , claimed that he , along with the other founders of that that program , supported the Tokamak not out of conviction that it was the best technical approach but rather that it would provide a vehicle via which political support for fusion development could be generated , thereby allowing them to pursue " all the hopeful new things the mainline labs would not try " . [ 1 ]
With fellow researcher Bruno Coppi , Bussard later founded Inesco , a private firm funded in part by Penthouse Magazine publisher Bob Guccione .
Inesco set out to build small power - producing Tokamak fusion reactors called Riggatrons using methods developed from the MIT Alcator research tokamaks .
The method they were trying to use in order to initiate fusion proved vastly more difficult to achieve than they had anticipated and Inesco eventually shut down when its funds ran out .
Bussard later founded another company , Energy Matter Conversion Corporation ( EMC2 ) , which has engaged in research on variants of the Farnsworth - Hirsch fusor .
In an article entitled " The World 's Simplest Fusion Reactor : How To Make It Work " in the December 12 , 1998 issue of Analog magazine , fusion researcher Tom Ligon described an easily - built demonstration fusor system , and some of Bussard 's ideas for fusion reactors and incredibly efficient spacecraft propulsion systems , which could enable single - stage spacecraft to travel anywhere in the Solar System in short times compared to chemical rockets .
On March 29 , 2006 , Bussard claimed on the fusor .
net forum that EMC2 had developed an inertial electrostatic confinement fusion process that was 100,000 times more efficient than previous designs .
However , the company 's funding ran out , and Bussard is looking for additional funding to develop a full - scale fusion power plant .
On June 23 , 2006 Bussard provided more details of the breakthrough and the circumstances of the shutdown of this work by the government .

Forum for IEC discussions

Dear Sir Philip :
I have read the threads on the Randi forum , and they are all intent and I am sure well - menaing .
However , I have not been able to " log in " on this forum so am writing to you instead .
Perhaps you can post this note as a reply and commentary to some of the issues raised by your forum correspondents .
First , what we have achieved in our rather unexpectedly good tests of last November 9 and 10th was an output of DD fusion at about 10 kV , at B fields of 1300 G , in a 30 cm diam device ( WB - 6 ) run in a pulsed mode from big capacitors , with a fusion rate of about 1E9 / sec .
This works out to be about 100,000 x higher than the data of Hirsch / Farnsworth at similar well depth and drive conditions .
The test duration was only about 0.4 masec , but since the electron lifetime is ca 0.1 microsec this is steady - state to the plasma particles .
We had neither the money , nor the cooling , nor the power supplies , nor the controls to run this small device steady - state , which is what we need to do , and what requires us to build the full - scale device .
This was a direct result of discovering something during late Spring / early summer tests of WB - 5 , which was a closed boc machine , like the early HEPS of 1989 .
What we discovered was -- in hindsight -- elementary ; it was that indeed God is in the details , and the detail of particular importance is that no metal surface penetrated by B fields must occupy more than about 1E - 4 to 1E - 5 of the total surface available to the recirculating electrons .
If this dead fraction is larger , there is NO hope of net power from any such machine .
AND , it is essential that the device be recirculating , i.e. that the electrons can circulate out and back through the cusps all over the machine .
Of course , this is obvious ; but in 15 years no one saw it , not Hirsch , not our consultants not our opponents , not our staff , and not me .
It is consistent with the need for electrons to recirculate about 100,000 times before being lost to collisions with structure , to yield net power .
Please remember that our device has the property that the electron flow and losses are decoupled from the ion flow and fusion generation .
Power balance depends on suppresssion of the electron losses , which are derived from the energetic electron injection that forms the gridless negative potential well that traps the ions .
When we figured this thing out , in summer 2005 , we quickly designed and quickly built WB - 6 , using only conformal ( with the B fields produced ) coil cans , so that no B field uniquely penetrated the cans , and then placed the coils in a special array so that no corners touched ( this latter is a long topic having to do with local B fields , and loss of WiffleBall trapping due to line cusp effects at the corners , etc , etc , and is the baisis of our final patents on this thing ) .
It IS the details that make or break the device .
And this particular set of details absolutely dominates the performance .
Anyway , we ran the device in October , for beta=one tests , to confirm transport scaling laws , and then in early November to test for fusion output .
And , happiness , indeed , three tests on 9 November and one on 10 Novem , ber gave the results mentioned above .
The next day , 11 November , we tried it again , but magnet coil motions induced by repeated testing had moved the coils enough that an insulation spot had worn away inside the cans , and the device shorted and blew up one leg , with the full cap discharge .
Having no further funding , we had to start shutting doen the lab the following Monday !!!
Irony ?
As to our funding -- our USN contract still exists , and still has about $ 2 M authorized in it .
However , year - by - year funding was NOT provide for FY 2006 , so that we knew we had to close down early in 2006 ..
What saved us was Adm Cohen ( CNR ) who put another 900 K into the program to try to get us down the road to where we DID go , and then we had to quit .
It was not a cutoff of OUR funding , but the entire Navy Energy Program was cut to zero in FY 2006 , and we were a part of this cut .
The funds were clearly needed for the more important War in Iraq .
So , as we cut down , we managed to save the lab equipment , by transfer to SpaceDev , which hired our three best lab people as well , and we are still trying to get the missing $ 2 M restored and put into our existing but unfunded contract .
IF this happens - which is improhable , given the politics of this election year , and the non-visionary people in Congress - we will redo WB - 6 with an improved and better version ( WB - 7 ) which should give 5 x more output , and run about 50 tests to quiet dissent .
AND we will convene a review panel of very high - level and internationally distinguished people to spend about 6 weeks going over this to recommend for or against proceeding sith a full scale demo .
This may or may not happen .
If it does , I have little doubt as to the panel recommendation , as the data and insight from WB - 5/ 6 is just too clear .
We really have solved the last engineering physics problem that has plagued our work for 12 year s or so .
Yes , there is much left to do , iespecially in controls and diagnostics , but these are predictable things not dependent on beating the Paschen curve .
And we still have to develop some reliable e-guns and i-sources , again predictable enginering that costs both time and money , but not new physics .
Why a full - scale demo ?
Because the system scales oddly : Fusion output goes as the 7th power of the size and Gain goes as the 5th power .
Thus there is very little to be gained by building a half - size model ; it is too weak to give anything definitive about power production or gain .
And our tests were always at about 1/8 to 1/10 scale of the full scale demo .
We told the DoD from the beginning that the real program would cost about 150 - 200 M , since 1987 , and they all knew this .
However , since the DoD has no charter to do such work , and the political realities were that a big DoD program would attract the ire and power of the DoE to kill it , it was never funded beyond about 1/8 the level required .
So we did what we could and finally DID prove the physics and associated engineering physics constraints , scaling laws , etc , albeit at 1/8-1/10 scale .
So what ?
Doubling the size will not tell us anything we do n't already know .
The next intelligent and logical step is to build a machine big enough to make net power .
And THAT is the same 200 M we have quoted to the DoD since the beginning .
As for energy companies " stampeding " to support us --
It is clear that a view like this is ignorant of the reality of energy companies .
There is only one thing the oil cvompanies want , and that is to sell oil , and more oil .
So long as the fields pump , the oil companies will squeeze .
They have NO , absolutely NO interest in anything new , ins spite of all their foolish ads in magazines for wind mills and solar - PV roofs .
It is all just show and tell .
I know these guys , and there is no way they would support anything that might get in the way of oil .
The only way to stop oil , from their view , is when it does run out .
And then they ''ll go for deeper drilling , new fields , Gulf geopressure gas , LNG , etc , etc , and keep raising the price , until finally foolish solar and windmills become competitive .
And we are paying the equivalent of $ 500 / bbl oil costs .
But Exxon and Halliburton are getting richer all the time .
Yes , we would like to build the demo plant , and yes , it will cost about 150 ( DD ) to 200 M ( pB11 ) , and who knows if any investor singly or a group can or will come up with the money .
One of the biggest obstacle is the world - wide tokamak lobby , which perpetuates the fraud that Hirsch , Trivelpiece and I foisted on the country in the 1970's when we started the big tokamak ball rolling .
Magnetic confinement fusion is a misnomer , as magnetic fields can NOT confine a plasma , only constrain its motion towards walls .
The entire history of the MagConf program has been to reduce transport to neo-classical ( not turbulent or instability - driven ) losses .
And THEN the machines are all inherently and inevitably huge and cost too much and make too much power to ever be economically useful --- as the utilities have been telling the AEC / DoE for 30 years .
No matter , the global tokamak program provides jobs for hudreds of thousands of people in many countries , and is a safe place to put political pork funding , simply because it IS NO THREAT TO OIL - it wo n't ever work , but it sounds good to the untutored public ..
As for us ; our company still exists , but we will not likely run any demo program - that will be up to others to carry it on , if we all get the chance .
Meanwhile , my objective is very simple .
I detest the energy stranglehold of our companies on our people , and am going to try to give our idea away at the soonest possible moment .
To anyone , anywhere , who might want to undertake its development .
And we 'll be happy to help in any way we can , if a serious interest develops anywhere in the world .
I think the US , UK , France , et al are lost causes , because of theri commitment to the failed tokamak effort , as is probably Germany , and maybe others , too .
China may be a possibility , as it is quite independent even though part of the ITER mess , Russia may be considererd , and countries like Spain , Brazil , Italy , Argentina , and others may logically have an interest .
I believe that the survival of our high - tech civilizations depends on getting off of fossile fuels ASAP , and - if we do not - we will descend into a growing series of " oil wars " and energy confrontations that can lead only to a huge cataclysim .
Which CAN be circumvented if only we build the clean fuison machines in time .
Our patents are in final form , and I am giving a paper in the Fall , and trying to get a large technical description together for a major paper by summer .
We shall see .
One final word : Actually our device is really not a variant of Farnwworth / Hirsch , but of Elmore / Tuck / Watson who propeosed the inversion of Farnsworth / Hirsch long ago ( ca. 1967 ) .
Their problem was the interception of circulating electrons by grids - we removed the grids and replaced them by B field insulated coils - thus our " grids " are the coils themselves ..
And we do know how these work , at last .
Good luck to all of us .
Cheers , RW Bussard

Should Google Go Nuclear ?
Baldrson writes
" One of the founders of the US Tokamak fusion program , Dr. Robert W. Bussard , gave a lecture at Google recently now appearing as a Google video titled ' Should Google Go Nuclear ? ' .
In it , he presents his recent breakthrough electrostatic confinement fusion device which , he claims , produced several orders of magnitude higher fusion power than earlier electrostatic confinement devices .
According to Bussard , it did so repeatably during several runs until it blew up due to mechanical stress degradation .
He 's looking for $ 200 M funding , the first million or so of which goes to rebuilding a more robust demonstrator within the first year .
He claims the scaling laws are so favorable that the initial full scale reactor would burn boron - 11 — the cleanest fusion reaction otherwise unattainable .
He has some fairly disturbing things to say in this video , as well as elsewhere , about the US fusion program which he co-founded . "

Clean , cheap , nuclear power ( no , really ) "
ABSTRACT ---
This is not your father 's fusion reactor !
Forget everything you know about conventional ... all thinking on nuclear fusion : high - temperature plasmas , steam turbines , neutron radiation and even nuclear waste are a thing of the past .
Goodbye thermonuclear fusion ; hello inertial electrostatic confinement fusion ( IEC ) , an old idea that 's been made new .
While the international community debates the fate of the politically - turmoiled $ 12 billion ITER ( an experimental thermonuclear reactor ) , simple IEC reactors are being built as high - school science fair projects .
Dr. Robert Bussard , former Asst. Director of the Atomic Energy Commission and founder of Energy Matter Conversion Corporation ( EMC2 ) , has spent 17 years perfecting IEC , a fusion process that converts hydrogen and boron directly into electricity producing helium as the only waste product .
Most of this work was funded by the Department of Defense , the details of which have been under seal ... until now .
Dr. Bussard will discuss his recent results and details of this potentially world - altering technology , whose conception dates back as far as 1924 , and even includes a reactor design by Philo T. Farnsworth ( inventor of the scanning television ) .
Can a 100 MW fusion reactor be built for less than Google 's annual electricity bill ?
Come see what 's possible when you think outside the thermonuclear box and ignore the herd .

An apparatus and method of enhancing nuclear fusion reactions utilizes a plasma , made up of ions and electrons , contained within a region , and enhances the density of the plasma using a collision - diffusion compressional enchantment process .
Ion acoustic wave generated within a central region of the system permits increased reflection and scattering of ions and thereby reduces their mean free path within the core region to permit greatly increased ions density sufficient to enhance nuclear fusion reactions within the core .

Abstract --
A fusion power generating device is disclosed having a relatively small and inexpensive core region which may be contained within an energy absorbing blanket region .
The fusion power core region contains apparatus of the toroidal type for confining a high density plasma .
The fusion power core is removable from the blanket region and may be disposed and / or recycled for subsequent use within the same blanket region .
Thermonuclear ignition of the plasma is obtained by feeding neutral fusible gas into the plasma in a controlled manner such that charged particle heating produced by the fusion reaction is utilized to boot - strap the device to a region of high temperatures and high densitities wherein charged particle heating is sufficient to overcome radiation and thermal conductivity losses .
The high density plasma produces a large radiation and particle flux on the first wall of the plasma core region thereby necessitating replacement of the core from the blanket region from time to time .
A series of potentially disposable and replaceable central core regions are disclosed for a large - scale economical electrical power generating plant .

Inertial Electrostatic Fusion systems can now be built by Robert W. Bussard
Our company , EMC2 , has been working since 1987 on the R&D of Iour polyhedral IEF concept for fusion ; mostly under DoD support .
Final tests were made last Oct / Nov on a unique new design , based on unexpected discoveries made in Spring / Summer 2005 .
This final machine , WB - 6 , showed 10 x lower e- losses than any predecessor and produced DD fusions at a rate over 100,000 x times higher than the data of Farnsworth - Hirsch in the 1960 's for same drive conditions .
We have now proven the engineering and physics scaling laws that allow design of full - scale net - power systems , whether on DD or pB11 .
USNavy budget line item that supported our work was zero - funded in FY2006 , and our lab had to shut down and close one week after achieving these results !
We are probably the only people on the planet who know how to make a real net power clean fusion system , and we are out of support !
Somewhat ironical !
The next logical step MUST be a full - scale net - power demo system , simply because there is not much left to do at small scale ; when it is realized that the fusion output of these devices scales as the 7th power of the size , and the gain scales as the 5th power .
These outlandish scalings ( inherent in the engineering physics of the thing ) make it useless to build half - scale systems ( for example ) .
Unless you are AT the net - power size , you are nowhere in power and gain , even though the physics IS relevant .
We have always been limited to about 0.1 scale , and have learned nearly all there is to know about the system 's basic operation .
Thus , we have the ability to do away with oil ( and other fossil fuels ) but it will take 4 - 6 years and ca. 100-200 M $ to build the full - scale plant and demonstrate it .
Anyone care ?

Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Reactor based Fusion Ash Impact Propulsion System by S. Krupakar Murali ( Fusion Technology Institute , University of Wisconsin , Madison -- 1500 Engineering Dr. , Madison , WI 53706 )
Abstract ---
A new Inertial Electrostatic Confinement reactor ( IEC ) based Fusion Ash Impact Propulsion ( FAIP ) unit devoid of magnetic fields is proposed in this paper .
Theoretically , this system yields extremely high specific impulse ~ 5.5 x 106s , higher than any other advanced propulsion concepts available at this time .
Besides , a very high specific power 100 kW/kg , and a relatively high thrust - to - weight ratio of ~ 0.031 can be obtained .
The present design produces a continuous thrust of ~0.9N over the entire duration of the journey .
FAIP system can be used to propel spaceships during interstellar missions such as mission to Heliopause , which is at a distance of around 120 to 150 A.U. in a period of ~ 30yrs .
The concept is also suitable for missions beyond Heliopause , since calculations show that the FAIP system does not burn all its fuel when it reaches Heliopause , ( at the end of the mission this system would have consumed only 3.55 kg of its fuel .
Hence if the system continues its trajectory much higher terminal velocities ( depending on the mission time ) could be achieved eventually , leading to the accomplishment of even longer - range missions .
The double gridded IEC device can be used to realize extremely high ion densities in the core region of the inner grid , which in turn results in an extremely high fusion power density there .
Recent experiments at University of Wisconsin , Madison ( U.W. Madison ) have demonstrated the feasibility of using advanced fusion fuel D – 3 He for steady state operation of the device e.g. , producing ~ 3 x107 ( 14.7MeV ) protons / sec steady state .
Research group at U.W. Madison , are the first to realize D – 3 He reactions on a steady state basis .

Inertial - Electrodynamic Fusion ( IEF ) Device
Energy / Matter Conversion Corporation ( EMC2 )
THE TECHNOLOGY
Dr. Bussard and his team at Energy / Matter Conversion Corporation , after close to 20 years of hard work , have developed a revolutionary radiation - free fusion process that could change the world as we know it today .
Fusion is the energy that powers everything in the universe .
The sun 's energy comes from fusion .
Alternatively , fission is the process whereby heavy atoms , which are nearly unstable , are split into two radioactive atoms .
Fusion , on the other hand , is when two light atoms merge .
The ultimate fuels for fusion include hydrogen and other light atoms such as lithium , boron , and helium isotopes .
Some of these reactions are radiation free , others are not .
The fusion process recommended by Dr. Bussard takes boron - 11 and fuses a proton to it , producing , in its excited state , a carbon - 12 atom .
This excited carbon - 12 atom decays to beryllium - 8 and helium - 4 . Beryllium - 8 very quickly ( in 10 - 13 s ) decays into two more helium - 4 atoms .
This is the only nuclear - energy releasing process in the whole world that releases fusion energy and three helium atoms -- and no neutrons .
This reaction is completely radiation free .
The most commonly studied fusion process today is the reaction that occurs between deuterium and tritium , the so - called DT reaction , that produces helium and a radioactive neutron .
Various magnetic confinement vessels have been designed and developed over the years to contain the high - energy DT fusion reaction .
The Tokamak is one such magnetic confinement vessel , 30 m across by 110 feet tall .
The majority of fusion processes being investigated today are very expensive , costing billions of U.S. dollars ; require giant machines ; and offer no predictability .
Nonetheless , we know that fusion works because every star is a fusion reactor .
The fusion reactors of the stars and the sun are held together by a direct force field .
This works very well and efficiently -- this force field is gravity .
Gravitational forces between particles draw them directly together .
Only one other force is known to be like gravity : this is the electric field force or " coulomb " force , between electrically - charged particles .
Charged particles of opposite signs attract each other with direct forces ; charged particles in electric fields feel forces directly along field gradients .
Thus , fusion fuel plasmas could be held together efficiently by electric forces and electric fields .
This is called " Electric Fusion " .
Dr. Bussard was not the first to try to create such a field .
One notable technique utilized a spherical screen grid that was biased to a positive potential , thereby attracting electrons through the screen , producing a negative potential well .
As the electrons passed through the screen , they slowed down as their kinetic energy was transformed into potential energy in the potential well , and ions could then be dropped into it at the edge , fall down , and be recirculated back and forth .
Any particles not reacting went back into the well .
The only problem with this method was that the grid was not transparent .
Because of the high interception rate on the grid , essentially all of the energy put into the electron acceleration went into the grid .
Energy was lost and the grid melted .
This technique just did n't work .
Dr. Bussard 's invention , however , removes the fore - mentioned grid and replaces it with a magnetic field .
It is known that magnetic fields do not contain neutral plasmas very well ( as illustrated in the case of the Tokamak ) .
Magnetic fields , however , contain electrons very easily because electrons are extremely light .
The basic approach of electric fusion is the following :
Quasi-spherical magnetic fields trap injected energetic electrons to form spherical negative potential well .
Fusion ions trapped in this spherical well focused through central region oscillate across the " core " until they are reacted .
The system acts like a spherical colliding beam device .
Fuel gas is input at the potential well edge .
Fusion products escape to system walls .
Ion fusion power generation occurs in a central region .
Electron drive power is decoupled from the fusion process .
Power balance is set by injected electron losses ; the main losses occurring through the magnetic cusps and to walls .
Magnetic confinement of electrons is critical .
" Wiffle Ball " ( WB ) effect insures cusp sealing .
Magnetic insulation of the walls is important .
" Magrid " ( MG ) effect reduces power and raises gain .
In 1994 , Dr. Bussard successfully demonstrated a wiffle ball , achieving a beta - 1 condition .
In 2005 , he was able to magnetically insulate the electrons from the walls via his " Magrid " transporter .
Early prototypes experienced some losses because the original coils touched one another , resulting in intersecting magnetic fields .
This made the magnetic field lines run into the metal vessel walls resulting in electron losses .
Dr. Bussard realized that all the coil containers had to be conformal to the magnetic fields they produced .
If he utilized circular torroidal coils spaced at the corners , the magnetic fields could be allowed to go out between the coils .
Using such a device , that offered both the wiffle ball effect and the magrid transporter , Dr. Bussard was able to achieve 1x109 fusions / second for .25 milliseconds .
In summary , Dr. Bussard 's Inertial Electrostatic Fusion offers
Small , efficient power reactors , 1 - 3 % the size of current magnetic confinement reactors .
Clean , radiation - free energy utilizing p B - 11 .
Relatively simple engineering with commercial viability in 6 - 10 years .
Low cost ( $ 150 - 200 million from program inception to demonstration of clean power . )

DIGG THIS
While speaking to a woman the other day that had never heard of Ron Paul , she stated “ My goodness , he is amazing .
He is the best kept secret of this presidential campaign . ”
She could not believe there was a contender who represented everything she wanted in a presidential candidate and more .
( For those of you who have not yet heard , Ron Paul is running for President . )
She talked about wanting to end the war in Iraq .
Ron Paul has promised to do that immediately and not leave a soldier behind .
She talked about wanting a more secure border .
Ron Paul has stated that he wants very strong borders and he was appalled that our government had taken border guards off of our borders to send them to Iraq .
She mentioned she is treading water financially and never seems to get ahead .
Ron Paul has a solution for that too : end the fiat money system so Congress cannot create monetary inflation .
Well , what about privacy she asked ?
She felt we have moved into an age of Big Brother .
Ron Paul wants to protect our privacy by sticking to a strict Constitutionalist policy .
He wants to end the Patriot Act that allows the government to enter your home without a warrant and without notifying you so you know they were there .
Dr. Paul wants to end the destruction of habeas corpus , the only doctrine we have that lets you see a lawyer if you land in jail .
Without it , all other rights are meaningless .
Dr. Paul has voted against every attempt to regulate and control the Internet .
He believes that the Constitution does not give Congress a right to decide who may or may not marry , or what drugs a physician may or may not prescribe .
Ron Paul believes in limited Federal government and limited taxes : he even wants to end the Income tax .
( Can you imagine taking home your whole paycheck ? )
The conversation continued .
She wanted to know why she should vote for a person who has no chance .
The obvious answer was because Ron Paul offered her everything she wanted .
The second not so obvious answer was that he is actually doing much better than anyone knows because the press hides all of his successes .
What most people do not know , because the mainstream press is doing its best to manipulate support away from Dr. Paul , is that he won the first debate , he came in second in the second debate , and he came in first in the third debate .
In the most recent straw polls Dr. Paul placed second in the Georgetown SC straw poll , he placed second in the Cob County straw poll and he won the Coalition for New Hampshire Taxpayers straw poll at their annual picnic .
As of this writing Ron Paul has placed number one in the PajamasMedia straw poll with 70.8 % of the votes !
Yet , over and over we are subjected to articles that say he has no chance .
( This is an oft - used tactic to sway voters away from a candidate because people do not like to " waste " a vote .
As if voting for what you want is a waste . )
The mainstream media call his supporters “ spammers , ” attempting to claim that all his Internet support is really just a few folks pressing a lot of buttons .
Nonetheless , his “ non-existent ” support is growing by leaps and bounds .
Oh , the big guys may have the big money , but Ron Paul has the people .
In one month alone , his Meetup supporters have grown from 16,184 to 25,101 with 4,192 more waiting to join in the fun .
He has 643 separate groups .
( These figures tend to rise daily ; they were accurate at the time this article was written . )
These are undeniable signs that the snowball is rolling .
When people get through the gauntlet of media attempts to control their thoughts and votes and actually HEAR Ron Paul speak ( see videos on YouTube like this one ) or read what he has written they become ardent supporters .
I dare you to click on that last link of articles he has written and start reading .
I double dare you .
Ron Paul brings a sense of decency back into the political arena .
He is not out to win the nomination so that he can run your life , he just wants to return this country to the basics of liberty and freedom we once enjoyed and used to fight for .
The rest of the candidates , on both sides , with the exception of Dennis Kucinich , are willing to use pre-emptive nuclear strikes against other countries .
Has it been so long that people have forgotten the horrors of nuclear war ?
Tens of thousands of innocent civilians die .
They get radiation sickness and die horrible deaths .
Babies die screaming with burning flesh .
Thousands are blinded and left helpless .
It is a horrible inhumane thought , let alone action .
Incredibly , when asked if they would take the option of a pre-emptive nuclear strike off the table , nearly all the other candidates , Republicans and Democrats alike said no .
When Dr. Paul was asked during the last GOP debate on Fox , what he thought was the most pressing moral issue facing our country he stated that it was the idea that all those other candidates were willing to entertain even the thought of pre-emptive nuclear strikes .
Even the most optimistic predictions about the effects of a major nuclear exchange predict the death of millions of civilians within a very short amount of time ; more pessimistic predictions argue that a full - scale nuclear war could bring about the extinction of the human race or its near extinction with a handful of survivors ( mainly in remote areas ) reduced to a pre-medieval quality of life and life expectancy for centuries after and cause permanent damage to most complex life on the planet , Earth ’s ecosystems , and the global climate .
Let ’s be clear here .
Pre-emptive warfare means that one country will strike another before they have been attacked .
Translated that means that if one of those other candidates becomes President they would consider dropping a nuclear weapon on another country on the thought that perhaps that country could be a threat to us .
Where are the headlines ?
Where is the outrage ?
Where is the humanity ?
Well , I can answer that last one , it is with Dr. Paul .
It is difficult to get through the morass of disingenuous reporting that insists on calling Dr. Paul names rather than address his policies .
But , if you can do it , and if you can find out information about him yourself , you will understand why those of us who support him are so emphatic in our love of this man .
He represents all that is good , or was good , about this country .
He lives a principled life and will not accept his own Congressional pension even though he has spent ten terms in Congress because he does not want to take one dime away from any American .
He sent his children to college but would not let them take out student loans because the government has limited resources and he wanted to make sure that loan money went to small businesses that needed it more than his children .
He has been married for 50 years .
If that does n’t show commitment I do n’t know what does .
Dr. Paul is the most moral , upstanding , best hope this country has .
Those who have read his writings and seen him speak have learned this .
I invite all to do the same .
Please click on this link to see his writings and things people have written about him .
Find out WHY his campaign is growing so fast , so exponentially , and with so many individual supporters .
Find out WHY most of his money comes from donations of less than $ 250 dollars each and almost none from the big players who want government favors .
Find out WHY people become so passionate about a silly politician .
Have you ever seen such a thing before ?
Dr. Paul offers us all hope .
Hope that things can actually change in this country and we will not get another 4 years of the same .
Disenfranchised Democrats , who voted expecting their party to end the war only to see the money handed over to continue it , are supporting Dr. Paul .
Why ?
Because Ron Paul voted against the war the first time it was brought up , he voted against it the second time it was brought up and he wants to end it completely now .
You can always trust people : you can trust them to act the way they have in the past .
Dr. Paul offers businesses hope out of the morass of paperwork and costs they have had to endure since the passage of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act .
An Act so heinous , it threatens to destroy the very fabric of our capital markets in this country .
He offers hope to the small business owner who just wants to try to make it on his own and not get buried in the costs of complying with section 404 .
Ron Paul offers hope to the elderly who need to have their Social Security checks .
Ron Paul wants to have a separate fund to make sure that Congress cannot raid the money and take it from those who need it most .
He also introduced an act to repeal all taxes on Social Security benefits .
He offers all hope that their savings will still have value in 20 years by taking us off a fiat money system and eliminating the possibility that Congress and the Fed can create monetary inflation .
He offers hope to the young people by devising a plan whereby they will have the option to opt out of the Social Security system completely .
He offers those same young people hope by promising to vote against a draft while the rest of Congress contemplates the idea .
Ron Paul offers hope to all .
Hope that things will change .
He is not the “ usual ” politician .
He is known as Dr. No in Washington because he will not take money from one group of people just to give it to another .
The lobbyists do n’t even bother knocking on his door .
They know better .
We need someone unusual .
The usual has brought us , well , the usual .
Where else can you find supporters who give up their weekends to make phone calls , spend their Saturdays standing on street corners with signs just so people will hear about their candidate ?
Where else do find people willing to meet others and work for hours stuffing envelopes , making DVDs and doing it all on their own dime and their own time ?
All the other candidates keep asking how Ron Paul has garnered this much support on the Internet .
He has done nothing .
Dr. Paul is more surprised than anyone .
The people are doing this all on their own .
It is his message of freedom and liberty that is doing the selling .
After all , that is the very foundation of our country : A thing the new breed of politician seems to have forgotten .
Freedom has been replaced with cameras on every corner and expected groping at the airport .
Liberty has been replaced by sneak - and - peek warrants , an end to habeas corpus , expectations to " show me your papers " and Executive decrees that place the President above the law .
By the way , Ron Paul also voted against the National ID card .
Ron Paul stands for limited government .
For many they think that means he is uncaring .
To those who understand , nothing could be further from the truth .
Our government does not make anything , create anything or have any means of creating wealth .
It has what it has by taking from others by force .
When Ron Paul seeks limited government , what he is really asking for is limited coercion over our lives .
That is why so many support him .
We do n't like being coerced .
We like liberty and freedom .
And we like Dr. Paul .
So , is Dr. Paul the best kept secret in this campaign ?
Perhaps he is .
One can only hope that it will not be for long .
The people need him and need to know he is out there .
They need to know he is a choice .
With any luck , and continued exponential growth , Ron Paul supporters will soon be strong enough to overtake the media manipulation machine that has done all it can to silence him .
As so many have said , what this country needs is a doctor to fix it , not another politician .
If his campaign continues to grow you can expect the negative , fact - voided , name - calling articles to continue and get nastier .
They will attack him on his most positive stances .
They will call him a nut for trying to stop the counterfeiting Federal Reserve so that Americans will have money that holds its value .
They will call him insane for trying to end the war in Iraq when 70 % of the people have that wish as well .
So fight back .
Do n't sit there and take it .
Do n't let the mainstream steal the one hope of getting out of the mess we are in .
Think for yourself and do the research .
Do n't let Ron Paul stay secret any longer .
Please read the links in this article .
Many of them are to Ron Paul 's articles and Acts he submitted to Congress .
These should help give you a better understanding of Dr. Ron Paul , Presidential candidate for 2008 .

August 4 , 2007
The Best of Jennifer Haman
U.S. engineers have long wanted to fold up an airplaneinside a rocket and send it on a mission to cruise through the atmosphere of Mars .
They now have a new potential customer for the concept : the Pentagon 'sDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .
DARPA started a programearlier this year called Rapid Eye to demonstrate technology that would lead todevelopment of a rocket - delivered unmanned plane to fly high over the site of anatural disaster or other " hot spot . "
The idea is to give the U.S. president a first , quick look at the scene , DARPA Director Tony Tethersaid , following his talk at the Geoint 2007 Symposium in San Antonio .
" We got this ideafrom NASA , " Tether said .
Engineers from NASA 's Ames Research Center in California and Langley Research Center in Virginia , who are working oncompeting concepts for " planetary aircraft , " began speaking withDARPA officials earlier this year about adapting some of their concepts forneeds on Earth .
Since the 1970s asuccession of NASA engineers and scientists have dreamed about flying an unmannedairplane over the surface of Mars to take close - up photos and make othermeasurements .
Dale Reed , a researcher at NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center , Edwards , Calif. , who died in 2005 , earned a patent in 1977 on his design for afoldable Mars airplane called the Mini -Sniffer .
In 1999 , then - NASAAdministrator Dan Goldin revived the dormant idea by challenging NASA to fly aplane over Mars in time for the centennial of the Wright Brothers flight in2003 .
Joel Levine of Langley twice proposed missions to deliver an airplane toMars .
None of those proposalsleft the ground because of a combination of budget , scientific and technicalchallenges .
Engineers at Ames and Langley have continued to work on theirdesigns in wind tunnels and in high - altitude tests , and today the idea offolding a plane inside a rocket and deploying it once it reaches Mars no longerseems as technically radical as it once did .
" I think there 'sactually relative agreement now that it 's technically feasible and not terriblyrisky , " said Larry Lemke , a mission designer at Ames .
Tether agreed .
" There 'sno reason why we can't do this , " he said .
NASA might have inspiredthe idea , but DARPA has decided to approach the U.S. aerospace industry firstthrough its Broad Agency Announcement process .
That has led some NASA engineersto wonder whether or how they might be able participate .
" They will beinvolved , " Tether said of NASA engineers .
" But we 're going out on ournormal process of a broad agency announcement to industry [ saying ] that we wantthis capability . "
On Mars , the airplanesthat have been proposed would fly in the thin martian atmosphere at altitudesbetween 5,000 to 10,000 feet ( 1,524 meters to 3,048 meters ) .
On Earth , thatwould be the equivalent of flying at 100,000 feet ( 30,480 meters ) , a perfectaltitude for surveillance , Tether said .
The concept of usingrockets to deploy sensors as rapidly as possible to any hot spot throughout theworld also is a goal of the U.S. Air Force 's Operationally Responsive Spaceinitiative .
" We did n't have thatin mind , " Tether said , noting that DARPA 's concept for Rapid Eye is tosupport " the president . "
Nevertheless , the same concept could be usedto support military personnel in the field , Tether said .
In a real world scenario , an unmanned Rapid Eye system would provide quick surveillance until othersensors could be trained on the scene .
Those could include sensors aboard thenew Ultra Long Endurance Aircraft DARPA is designing , Tether said .
Those craft would be slowflying but they would able to stay aloft for up to five years and would besupported by an autonomous refueling system DARPA is developing , Tether said .
" It sounds funny , but imagine if we could do that .
Who needs satellites ? " he said .
A description of theprogram published in July said the goal of Rapid Eye is to develop ahigh - altitude , long - endurance , unmannedaircraft that can be rocket - deployed from the continental United Statesworldwide within one to two hours to perform intelligence , surveillance , reconnaissance , and communication missions .
The enabling technologieslisted included inflatable , folding structures , stable and dense energystorage , and low - oxygen propulsion .

The campaign will include a series of hard - hitting posters
The £ 1.5 m Piracy is a Crime campaign , the biggest of its kind yet in the UK , was launched in London on Monday by broadcaster Jonathan Ross .
A new trailer will warn that buying a copy is like stealing a car or phone .
Ross admitted he had bought pirate DVDs in the past - but said : " Were they wise purchases ?
Of course not . "
Campaign posters have hard - hitting messages including : " Terrorist groups sell DVDs to raise funds . "
Militant groups are involved in selling DVDs in the UK , according to the Federation Against Copyright Theft ( Fact ) , the industry 's anti-piracy unit .

Tracking down the pirate DVDs
" I do accept it 's maybe more regionalised and it's not a problem widespread throughout the whole of the United Kingdom , " he told BBC News Online .
But the campaign emphasises that other organised criminals including people traffickers , drug dealers and paedophile rings are likely to be involved if terrorists are not .
In London and surrounding counties , Mr Leinster said , the culprits were more likely to be Chinese gangs who forced illegal immigrants to sell DVDs on the streets .
" By purchasing pirated DVDs , many consumers are unwittingly helping to fund hardcore criminals with links to people trafficking , drugs , guns and money laundering , " he said .
" The potential high returns and relatively low risks mean that organised crime groups have got into DVD piracy in a big way . "
The group behind the campaign , The Industry Trust for Intellectual Property Awareness , includes the UK home entertainment arms of Hollywood studios and retailers such as HMV and Asda .
It says pirate DVD seizures in the first half of 2004 more than tripled compared with the same period in 2003 .
It 's very easy to find pirated product - even though we 're fighting as hard as we can

As well as the alleged criminal links , film fans are also likely to get a poor viewing experience from the copies , the campaign says .
It says nine out of 10 pirated DVDs of films that have not yet been officially released are filmed from the back of a cinema with a camcorder .
Jonathan Ross said of the pirate DVDs he bought : " Without exception , they were rubbish , they were shaky , out of focus , camerawork was bad , they had muffled sound - they were a cheap , shoddy , second - rate version of the original .
The " romantic , Robin Hood image of DVD pirates " was far from reality , he said , telling film fans they had a choice .
" Either they can buy genuine high - quality DVDs and support all the people that keep the home entertainment industry going in this country .
' Unsavoury individuals '
" Or they can buy the hooky gear and put the money into the pockets of some very unsavoury individuals indeed . "
Copies of Spider - Man 2 , which has its UK premiere in London on Monday , have already appeared for sale on UK streets and the internet .
That is a fact acknowledged by Marek Antoniak , managing director of Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment , which will eventually release the film 's official DVD .
" Every big blockbuster will be pirated - pirates know that 's where the money is , " he told BBC News Online .
" It 's very easy to find pirated product - even though we 're fighting as hard as we can .
It will be a campaign over time and we 've got to start somewhere . "

RAF jets were scrambled twice yesterday to intercept Russian aircraft heading for and inside British airspace .
Tornado fighters had already been sent up on Tuesday to meet two bombers approaching Britain from a Russian base in the Arctic Circle .
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was " rare and unusual " for three incidents to follow so closely .
The aerial tensions come amid titfortat expulsions of diplomats following the Kremlin 's refusal to extradite radiation murder suspect Andrei Lugovoy .
Russia 's foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , said last night he wanted to see a return to " normal relations " with Britain .

But the arrival in yesterday 's early hours of the Tupolev aircraft - also known as Bears - suggests president Vladimir Putin is not backing down .
Two Tornados were scrambled from RAF Leeming , near Darlington , after two Tu95 bombers were picked up on radar .
They were intercepted inside British airspace shortly after 2 am but , with the RAF pilots on their tail , the intruders turned and flew north .
Another alert a few hours later led to the scrambling of two more Tornados .
RAF sources said the planes were recalled when it turned out that the Tu160 Blackjack bomber was only on the " fringes of UK airspace " .
It also made off to the north from a position off Scotland .

Tuesday 's incident saw two Tu95s approached by Norwegian F16s and RAF Tornados off the coast of Norway .
Russian air force commander Colonel Alexander Zein said the encounter had no connection with the political row between London and Moscow .
" Our planes were flying planned flights over neutral waters , " he insisted .
Yesterday a Russian air force spokesman said all the sorties were training flights .
The Tu95 can carry missiles as well as undertake surveillance missions .
With a range of more than 8,000 miles at a top speed of 575 mph , it was the Russian answer to the American B - 52 .
The Tu95 took its maiden flight in the early 1950s and was designed to drop nuclear weapons .
It has been redesigned to carry cruise missiles and can even be converted for use as a civilian airliner .
The Tu160 , which can reach speeds of up to 1,380 mph , was brought into service in the 1980s .
Nicknamed the White Swan by its Russian pilots , it can carry up to 88,000 lbs of ordnance including either cruise or short - range nuclear missiles .
Russian authorities would not disclose whether the planes in this week 's incidents were carrying bombs or simply on surveillance duties .
On a visit to Paris yesterday , Gordon Brown insisted that Mr Lugovoy , the prime suspect in the murder of exiled dissident Alexander Litvinenko , must be extradited to face trial in the UK .
Russia has insisted however that it can deal with the case through its own justice system .
Mr Litvinenko , who like Mr Lugovoy was a former agent of the FSB - the successor to the Communist - era KGB - died in a London hospital last November from a fatal dose of the extremely rare radioactive isotope polonium - 210 .
A British citizen , he was a fierce critic of Mr Putin 's regime and had close links with a network of expatriatedissidents , both in the UK and New York .
He and Mr Lugovoy met at the Millennium Hotel in London 's Grosvenor Square on the day he was poisoned .
Mr Brown said : " We had to take difficult decisions in relation to the Litvinenko case and we will not tolerate a situation where a British citizen is assassinated on British
" Our first duty is to protect our citizens and to prevent there being lawlessness in the streets of London . "
Britain announced on Monday it was expelling four Russian diplomats from London .
Moscow retaliated on Thursday , saying four Britons would be kicked out of Russia .
The RAF tried to play down suggestions that the three separate incidents involving Russian planes were linked to political tensions .
Mr Lugovoy yesterday claimed that the British secret services attempted to recruit him in a spying mission to gather compromising material about the Mr Putin .
“ The people who are reacting to that word are not reading the book as a whole , ” she said .
“ That ’s what censors do — they pick out words and do n’t look at the total merit of the book . ”
If it were any other novel , it probably would have gone unnoticed , unordered and unread .
But in the world of children ’s books , winning a Newbery is the rough equivalent of being selected as an Oprah ’s Book Club title .
Libraries and bookstores routinely order two or more copies of each year ’s winners , with the books read aloud to children and taught in classrooms .
“ The Higher Power of Lucky ” was first published in November by Atheneum / Richard Jackson Books , an imprint of Simon & Schuster , accompanied by a modest print run of 10,000 .
After the announcement of the Newbery on Jan. 22 , the publisher quickly ordered another 100,000 copies , which arrived in bookstores , schools and libraries around Feb .
5 .
Reached at her home in Los Angeles , Ms. Patron said she was stunned by the objections .
The story of the rattlesnake bite , she said , was based on a true incident involving a friend ’s dog .
And one of the themes of the book is that Lucky is preparing herself to be a grown - up , Ms. Patron said .
Learning about language and body parts , then , is very important to her .
“ The word is just so delicious , ” Ms. Patron said .
“ The sound of the word to Lucky is so evocative .
It ’s one of those words that ’s so interesting because of the sound of the word . ”
Image Susan Patron , the author of the book and a librarian , said the controversial word was just part of the characters learning about body parts .

Ms. Patron , who is a public librarian in Los Angeles , said the book was written for children 9 to 12 years old .
But some librarians countered that since the heroine of “ The Higher Power of Lucky ” is 10 , children older than that would not be interested in reading it .

Want to attract thousands of visitors ?
If you are a blogger struggling to succeed on the social sites , this post is a must read .
Up until three days ago I had n’t been able to get much traffic from any of the social sites ( Digg , Reddit , StumbleUp , etc. ) .
I ’d been frequently submitting to all of them but nothing stuck .
I was n’t sure why .
I knew my content was good , but for some reason people were n’t going for it .
I finally made a break through , and I ’ll tell you exactly how it happened .
The Stats
On Friday , January 26 , I wrote a post titled “ The Two Types of Cognition ” .
I posted it to Reddit , StumbleUpon , and Del.icio.us and attracted a grand total of 100 visitors in the next two days .
The average time spend on the post ( 6:11 ) was great , so I knew the people who read it liked it .
The problem was people were n’t seeing it .
On Saturday , my friend Greg came by and told me he liked the post and that I should try to promote it .
This planted the seed of curiosity .
On Sunday I decided to make an effort to promote the article .
I realized that my original headline sucked .
I ’m new to copywriting , so I normally want to use headlines as labels .
‘ The Two Types of Cognition ’ is a perfect description of the post and it includes the main keyword , but it does n’t give the reader any incentive .
My breakthrough was galvanized by the discovery of Steve Olson ‘s post , “ How This Blog Attracted 100,000 Visitors in the First 30 Days “ .
Through Steve ’s post I discovered “ 5 of Your Headlines Remixed ” by Brian Clark .
If you want traffic READ THIS POST .
After reading Brian ’s article and some of the other links from Steve ’s post I resolved to concoct a new headline and resubmit to the social sites .
I came up with “ Learn to Understand Your Own Intelligence “ .
A bit more provocative is n’t it ?
I submitted to all the same sites , made it up to the second page of Reddit and got a few del.icio.us tags and stumbles .
Reddit brought in some good traffic , but it really took off with StumbleUpon .
As of this moment that article has attracted 4,930 unique views .
Not bad for a site that normally averages a couple hundred visitors a day .
As a bonus , people started stumbling one of my other pages , leading to even more traffic .
Here is a chart depicting how rewriting a single headline has affected this site ’s traffic .
I did n’t write this post to brag .
Many other people attract many more visitors over the social sites everyday .
I wanted to point out that content is not always the biggest issue .
The EXACT SAME ARTICLE had drastically different results all because of a headline .
And it is n’t even that tough .
Read the posts I linked to earlier , take the lessons to heart , and start putting a lot more effort into your headlines and opening paragraphs .
Do n’t let your great content go to waste .

Colorful Moon Mosaic
Credit & Copyright : Noel Carboni
Explanation :
No single exposure can easily capture faint stars along with the subtle colors of the Moon .
But this dramatic composite view highlights both .
The mosaic digitally stitches together fifteen carefully exposed high resolution images of a bright , gibbous Moon and a representative background star field .
The fascinating color differences along the lunar surface are real , though highly exaggerated , corresponding to regions with different chemical compositions .
And while these color differences are not visible to the eye even with a telescope , moon watchers can still see a dramatic lunar presentation tonight .
A partial eclipse of the Moon will be visible from Europe , Africa , Asia , and Australia .
A ghostly white bow shines from mountain fog on Carn Gorm , Scotland .
This spectacular fogbow was photographed by Simon Caldwell ( site ) in February 1999 .
The matching IRIS simulation shows that the fog droplets were ~ 60 micron diameter .

The Mie scattering simulation used a mean droplet diameter of 60 micron with a lognormal distribution of diameters having a standard deviation 12 % to match the width of the primary fogbow and the position of the two supernumerary arcs inside the main bow .
For years , the private terror - hunters at the SITE Institute have been infiltrating jihadist chat rooms , and spying on the extremists congregating online .
Now , the group its digital cover has been blown – and Al - Qaeda online communications channels have gone dark – thanks to a ham - handed move by the Bush administration , it seems .
" Techniques that took years to develop are now ineffective and worthless , " SITE 's Rita Katz told the Washington Post .
[ SITE ] obtained a new Osama bin Laden video ahead of its official release last month ...
Around 10 a.m. on Sept. 7 , Katz sent both [ National Counterterrorism Center # 2 Michael ] Leiter and [ White House Counsel Fred ]
Fielding an e-mail with a link to a private SITE Web page containing the video and an
English transcript .
" Please understand the necessity for secrecy , " Katz wrote in her e-mail .
" We ask you not to distribute ... [ as ] it could harm our investigations . "
Exactly what happened next is unclear .
But within minutes of Katz 's e-mail to the White House , government - registered computers began downloading the video from SITE 's server , according to a log of file transfers .
The records show dozens of downloads over the next three hours from computers with addresses registered to defense and intelligence agencies .
By midafternoon , several television news networks reported obtaining copies of the transcript .
A copy posted around 3 p.m. on Fox News 's Web site referred to SITE and included page markers identical to those used by the group .
" This confirms that the U.S. government was responsible for the leak of this document , " Katz wrote in an e-mail to Leiter at 5 p.m .
Al - Qaeda supporters , now alerted to the intrusion into their secret network , put up new obstacles that prevented SITE from gaining the kind of access it had obtained in the past , according to Katz .
I think it bears repeating at this moment that Fielding 's boss , one George W. Bush , last year accused reporters of compromising national security because they discussed a bogus roadside bomb countermeasure .
Will the President come down as hard on his own staff , if it turns out they leaked something much more serious ?
As we 've noted before , today 's jihadists do n't just use the Internet , occasionally .
" They do n't exist without the Web , " says Naval Postgraduate School professor John Arquilla .
Everything from recruiting to training to propaganda is handled online .
According to the New York Sun , the video disclosure effectively shut down the window into those activities .
One intelligence officer who requested anonymity said in an interview last week that the intelligence community watched in real time the shutdown of the Obelisk system ... [ the ] network of Web sites serves not only as the distribution system for the videos produced by Al Qaeda 's production company , As - Sahab , but also as the equivalent of a corporate intranet , dealing with such mundane matters as expense reporting and clerical memos to mid- and lower - level Qaeda operatives throughout the world .
While intranets are usually based on servers in a discrete physical location , Obelisk is a series of sites all over the Web , often with fake names , in some cases sites that are not even known by their proprietors to have been hacked by Al Qaeda ...
By Friday evening , one of the key sets of sites in the Obelisk network , the Ekhlaas forum , was back on line .
The Ekhlaas forum is a password - protected message board used by Qaeda for recruitment , propaganda dissemination , and as one of the entrance ways into Obelisk for those operatives whose user names are granted permission .
Many of the other Obelisk sites are now offline and presumably moved to new secret locations on the World Wide Web .
Ben Venzke , who runs IntelCenter , a ( sorta ) SITE rivals , says his " sources , methods and techniques ... to collect terrorist video material remain intact . "
However , the continued public release of videos before terrorist groups officially release them has been making it progressively more difficult to collect video material early in the dissemination process .
While IntelCenter does release material publicly it only does so after an evaluation is made to insure that sources and methods are protected and a careful weighing of the benefits versus costs .
The single driving factor behind this decision process is what best serves the work of the overall counterterrorism community with the most important objective being the prevention of attacks and removal of threats .
It is not just about getting the video first .
It is about having the proper methods and procedures in place to make sure that the appropriate intel gets to where it needs to go in the IC and elsewhere in order to support ongoing counterterrorism operations .
Simply getting the video first but not having the professional knowledge and responsibilities to know what to do with it can not only result in the loss of valuable intelligence but it can actually harm ongoing activities within the official counterterrorism commmunity , as has happened time and time again when private citizens and organizations outside of the IC play in fields where they lack the depth and experience .
While much attention in the public arena is paid to getting videos first , this is actually a much smaller part of the work that is done within the official counterterrorism community .
Work on videos continues weeks after their release and involves many facets of analytical and other efforts .
While any jump start one can get is of benefit , a few hours when taken in the overall context of weeks of work is relatively insignificant .

There 's no doubt about it : Adobe 's Portable Document Format better known as PDF is a choice tool for digital document delivery .
Some might say that it 's the tool for delivering complex documents to wide array of users , as its design allows for faithful rendering on any platform that supports PDF application issues , font problems , layout quirks , etc. , need need not apply .
Enter Microsoft .
The company has been toiling away on its own " portable " document technology for some time and plans to make a splash with it in 2007 .
Dubbed the XML Paper Specification ( or more succinctly , XPS ) , Microsoft plans support for the new format in both Windows Vista and Office 2007 .
In response , Adobe went to EU regulators earlier this year to ask that they bar Microsoft from including XPS support in Windows Vista , fearing that the ability to create XPS documents " for free " could cut into their ability to sell PDF creation software to Windows users .
Now in a move to appease EU regulators , Microsoft is going to step things up a notch and try to push XPS through as a standard .
For Adobe , this could ultimately make XPS more not less — popular .
EU making XPS a better competitor ?
For its part , Microsoft had previously indicated that its XPS technology would be licensed " royalty - free " to developers , and the company also promised a so - called " covenant not to sue " provision for businesses working on XPS print support , scanning technologies , and certain graphics display technologies .
However , at the behest of the EU , Microsoft is now taking matters a step further .
A company spokesperson told Ars Technica that Microsoft " agreed to submit our new fixed - layout document format the XML Paper Specification to a standards - setting organization , and to revise the licensing terms on which the specification is made available to other software developers . "
Microsoft is looking again at its license in order to make it compatible with open source licenses , which means that the " covenant not to sue " will likely be extended to cover any intellectual property dispute stemming from the simple use or incorporation of XPS .
The end result is that using XPS may be considerably more attractive for developers now that the EU has apparently expressed concerns over the license .
The company has not hinted to which standards body it would submit XPS , but a few things are clear already .
First , standards approval will see Microsoft opening XPS to the point that any platform could theoretically support it , including Linux and Mac OS X .
If it remains royalty - free , this could mean a proliferation of support for the format .
Second , given that the EU is pushing Microsoft to be more open with XPS , we can expect Microsoft to take an approach similar to Adobe : the specification would remain " open " but also controlled by the company .
Until details of Microsoft plans are available , it 's difficult to say how XPS will ultimately be positioned by the company .
We do wonder if the EU has n't in effect made XPS that much more of a PDF competitor , however , by leading Microsoft to adopt more open licensing .
If Adobe had hoped that the EU would ask Microsoft to remove XPS from Vista , the end result is probably the farthest thing from what they wanted .
A copy of Waxman 's letter to Susan Ralston is below .
It says that Jack Abramoff ( and associates ) had more than 400 contacts with the White House !
Susan Ralston is a key figure in the corruption scandal plaguing the Republican Party .
For those who do n't know , she was Jack Abramoff 's Assistant prior to the theft of the 2001 election .
When Karl Rove moved into the White House , he was looking for a " trustworthy " assistant and Jack Abramoff , being the stand - up guy that he is , offered his very own assistant ..... Susan Ralston .
We have long suspected that she is key to this criminal enterprise and now we may be getting closer to the truth .
UPDATE : Clammyc has provided a link to a diary written back on May 10 , 2006 discussing the missing security logs and bogus claims by the WH that Jack Abramoff had only visited 2 times .
It 's worth another look .
UPDATE # 2 : Kossack , EasyRider , has provided an excellent link to Raw Story with more info on Susan Ralston :
Susan Rawstory 's ROVE AIDE CALLED TO TESTIFY TOOK HIS MESSAGES
A former senior aide to Bush adviser Karl Rove who reportedly gave testimony to a grand jury investigating the leaking of a CIA agent 's identity answered phones and took Rove 's messages , RAW STORY has discovered .
According to a 2004 Salon piece , she also had a role with one of conservative Washington 's leading men , Grover Norquist , in which she took messages for Rove and called Norquist to screen callers .
" For two years , the assistant who answered Rove 's phone was a woman who had previously worked for lobbyist Jack Abramoff , a close friend of Norquist 's and a top DeLay fundraiser , " Salon reported .
" One Republican lobbyist , who asked not to be named because DeLay and Rove have the power to ruin his livelihood , said the way Rove 's office worked was this : ' Susan took a message for Rove , and then called Grover to ask if she should put the caller through to Rove .
If Grover did n't approve , your call did n't go through . ' "

ON THE RISE :
As the housing market softens , a combination of consumer naivete and aggressive lending means owners with subprime loans are increasingly getting sucked down a financial black hole 1 / 7 Back to Gallery
To many people in the affluent Bay Area , losing a home to foreclosure sounds like a Depression - era relic or a Rust Belt phenomenon .
Our real estate prices have defied gravity for so long ; our job market is so strong ; our cachet as a place to live seems so obvious .
How could foreclosures happen here ?
But in recent months , the Bay Area has proven to be home to numerous victims of the subprime loan debacle .
Just like elsewhere in the country , people here with tarnished credit or limited funds bought houses that proved to be beyond their means , often putting little or no money down , and borrowing money through exotic , expensive loans that were virtual time bombs set to soar to unaffordable levels after an introductory period .
Aggressive mortgage brokers , voracious lenders and naive consumers combined to create an unstable situation .
The tipping point came a year and a half ago when real estate prices started to flatten or fall in some areas .
Suddenly , home buyers who had planned to refinance saw that door slammed shut because they no longer had equity in their houses and their " introductory rate " mortgages quickly became unaffordable as interest rates -- and their monthly payments -- rose .
This year , almost 1 million people nationwide will enter a stage of foreclosure , according to RealtyTrac.com .
That great tidal wave is ravaging the already beleaguered real estate market and causing repercussions from Wall Street to Washington , D.C .
In the second quarter of this year , 2,206 homes in the nine - county Bay Area were lost to foreclosure , according to real estate service DataQuick Information Systems .
That was the highest number for this area since DataQuick started tracking foreclosures in 1988 , and an almost nine - fold increase from 258 foreclosures in the April - June period last year .
Also in the second quarter , DataQuick said 7,696 Bay Area homeowners received notices that they were in default on their mortgage payments -- the first step in the foreclosure process .
That was more than double the 2,910 default notices received at the same time last year .
Some observers say that many of those facing foreclosure should never have bought a house .
To be sure , many consumers were seduced by the American dream of homeownership and so financially unsophisticated that they did n't apply due diligence .
For Bay Area residents , more than a decade of consistently rising home prices may have led to a mob mentality of people overeager to jump into the real estate market , confident they would quickly gain equity .
On the other side of the equation , many lenders pushed the envelope .
For example , Ameriquest Mortgage Co. , the nation 's leading subprime lender , is now paying $ 325 million to 725,000 borrowers nationwide for allegedly improper sales practices , including failing to adequately disclose home - loan terms and rates , refinancing borrowers into inappropriate loans , inflating home appraisals , and charging excessive fees and prepayment penalties .
Foreclosures have a much broader impact than just misfortune for the people who lose their homes .
Within neighborhoods , they cause real estate prices to sink because houses on the verge of foreclosure or already foreclosed upon often are resold at lower prices .
That , in turn , has a ripple effect on the overall real estate market .
Increasing foreclosures are one reason the current housing downturn has proven to be more severe and long - lasting than anticipated .
Foreclosures also take a deeply personal toll .
As shown in these profiles of several Bay Area homeowners who got in over their heads , a foreclosure goes through many stages , and is an extended and complex process during which homeowners desperately search for solutions to save their homes and salvage their credit ratings .
Foreclosure trail
Foreclosure is a complicated process that usually takes many months .
Here are some of the steps involved in a foreclosure .
Default :
When a homeowner falls behind on mortgage payments -- how far behind varies with different lenders -- the bank sends a notice of default and records it with the county recorder 's office .
Homeowners can try to rectify the situation by bringing payments up to date or refinancing .
They can try to sell the house , but selling for less than they owe on the mortgage -- a " short sale " -- requires approval from the lender and can have negative tax consequences .
The percentage of default notices that result in foreclosure is rising .
DataQuick Information Service said one year ago only 12 percent of defaults resulted in foreclosure .
This year , 45.4 percent of defaults ended up being foreclosed .
Notice of trustee sale :
Three months after the notice of default , the lender can announce that it is putting the property up for auction .
The lender notifies the homeowner and files a notice with the county recorder 's office .
It is common for auctions to be postponed , sometimes multiple times and often at the last minute , as the homeowner tries to stave off foreclosure .
Auction : Properties are auctioned on the courthouse steps in the county where they are located .
Because sales are all - cash and " as is , " the vast majority of homes revert to the lender at auction .
Once a house has been through a courthouse auction , a trustee 's deed is filed with the county signifying that it no longer belongs to the homeowner and is a foreclosure .
Resources
Here are some places homeowners facing foreclosure can turn for assistance .
Your bank : Lenders stress that homeowners should contact their lender immediately if they have trouble making their mortgage payments .
Ask to speak to the workout department .
Ask if your loan can be modified , for example , by adding a year onto its term .
Ask if you qualify for " forbearance " -- temporary reduction or suspension of payments .

Johnny Pitts , 42 , loves tigers so much that he 's crammed almost every inch of his bedroom with big - cat keepsakes .
A life - size toy tiger and her two cubs crouch atop the tiger bedspread on his bed , nestled next to a tiger watercolor and a tiger rug .
The remaining surfaces are decorated with African statues and inspirational Christian sayings .
" My home is my oasis , " said Pitts , a cheerful and talkative man who works as a driver for San Francisco Muni .
" It 's like Disneyland come to life , " he added proudly , showing off the hundreds of color magnets -- a vivid rain forest of tropical birds and exotic fruit -- adorning his kitchen .
Pitts ' wide - eyed enthusiasm worked against him when he bought his house .
A couple of years ago , a friend referred Pitts to a mortgage broker .
The broker , who also acted as Pitts ' real estate agent , showed him the three - bedroom house on Oakland 's MacArthur Boulevard .
The 1930s bungalow was rundown and the street is a busy thoroughfare , but Pitts liked the neighborhood and agreed to buy the house for $ 429,950 .
Pitts said the broker told him his mortgage would be $ 2,000 a month with no down payment .
Pitts put himself entirely in the broker 's hands .
He did n't scrutinize the paperwork .
He did n't get a home inspection .
After he moved in , it turned out his mortgage payment was indeed $ 2,039 .
But there was a second mortgage with a payment of $ 841 .
Pitts makes about $ 4,000 a month , so that meant three - quarters of his income is eaten up by the mortgage .
After a few months , Pitts got a bill for supplemental property tax , which is a standard assessment for new owners .
That $ 4,000 hit caused him to skip a couple of mortgage payments last year and he spent several months getting caught up .
" The money I put away for rainy days , my ' do not touch fund ' is going away , " he said .
Pitts said he fell behind on his mortgage again this year due to higher monthly charges for taxes .
He 's been working extra shifts and now has finally gotten caught up with his mortgage .
But there 's a bigger problem around the corner .
Pitts ' first mortgage , currently at an interest rate of 10.026 percent , will reset higher in October , adding $ 850 onto his payments .
That would mean a monthly total of $ 3,730 , plus several hundred more in taxes and insurance .
Meanwhile , the cooling real estate market means his house is now worth $ 330,000 , according to an appraiser Pitts hired this month because he hopes to reduce his property taxes .
" I 've learned all this new terminology , " Pitts said ruefully .
" I 'm what they call ' upside down ' -- that means I owe more than the house is worth .
You have to have equity in your house to refinance , and I do n't have any . "
Pitts turned to nonprofit ACORN Housing for assistance .
He hopes his lender will agree to modify his loan to avoid the huge increase in October or even to lower his payments .
He plans to get a roommate and continue working extra shifts .
" All I 'm asking for is a loan modification , " Pitts said .
" I make good money , I do n't have other bills . "
The mortgage broker has closed his company and could not be located for comment .
The mortgage originator , BNC Mortgage of Irvine , a subprime lender owned by Wall Street firm Lehman Bros. , resold Pitts ' mortgage , as is common in the business .
" As a responsible lender , BNC Mortgage works hard to ensure that its loans meet our underwriting guidelines , " a spokesman said .
Pitts ' loans are now being serviced by banking powerhouse Chase , part of JP Morgan Chase & Co. Chase declined to say who currently owns the loan .
" Chase has been working with ( Pitts ) over a number of months on getting current with the loan , " said Tom Kelly , a Chase spokesman .
" We are willing to work with him or a community group and look at possibilities .
Sometimes when you 're in a difficult financial situation , the choices might not be pretty . "
In terms of modifying Pitts ' loan , Kelly said : " We have to make sure it meets the legal and contractual obligations that we have with investors . "
Meanwhile Pitts feels like he 's gotten a lifetime 's worth of financial education .
" This home ownership is not what it 's cracked up to be , " he said .
" My home is my little piece of the Plymouth rock .
I 'm going to keep working like a dog to keep it . "

Pitts , 42 , is a San Francisco Muni driver .
Monthly net income : About $ 4,000 .
House :
Three - bedroom , Oakland , purchased in 2005 for $ 429,950 ; recently appraised at $ 330,000 .
Mortgage : $ 2,880 a month ( not including taxes and insurance ) , due to reset to $ 3,730 a month in October .
Status :
Fell behind on mortgage payments but has caught up .
Will not be able to afford new mortgage rate in October .
Joann Gardner was scared .
Mortgage payments on her family
home were now eight months in arrears .
The lender planned to auction the house in foreclosure proceedings at noon .
She was getting ready to drive to the Alameda County Courthouse to see what would happen .
She pictured that " bigwigs , investors ( would ) fork out the money . "
Just 90 minutes before the appointed time on July 3 , Gardner got a phone call that the auction had been postponed for a month .
Her real estate agent said the lender had agreed to allow time to try to sell the house to an investor who would rent it back to the family .
" It 's a big load off my shoulders for now , " said Gardner , a voluble woman with high cheekbones and an aquiline nose .
" But I know it 's just postponing the inevitable .
They will be putting me out of the frying pan into something worse . "
The inevitable seems to be that Gardner , 50 , and her elderly parents will lose their modest two - bedroom home in Oakland 's Sobrante Park neighborhood , where she 's lived her whole life .
Her parents bought the house in 1954 for $ 11,500 and raised their four children there , outliving two of them .
After refinancing more than a dozen times over the years to pull out money , the Gardners now owe $ 454,500 on the house .
She thinks it is probably worth about $ 350,000 .
Gardner said her lack of financial knowledge and the need for funds to fix up the house and pay off bills kept inducing her to refinance .
Public records show that the home was refinanced four times in the past two years .
Each time , Gardner said , she did n't understand the mortgage terms , and the family did not receive as much cash out as they had expected .
" I 've learned a valuable lesson at the expense of this house , " she said .
" People do n't have your back . "
On the July day when the auction was scheduled , the compact house brimmed with activity .
In the back yard , crammed with tools and debris , Gardner 's father , Johnnie Gardner , 86 , shuffled stiffly around his pickup truck .
Her mom , Estelle Gardner , 87 , watched TV in her bedroom .
Joann Gardner 's great - nephew , Jaron Isom , 20 , who stays in the small den , played computer games , while his visiting 4 - year - old sister , Maaiah , scribbled out a series of drawings .
Joann Gardner and a neighbor sat at the kitchen table shaking their heads as they looked through the loan documents she and her dad had signed on Halloween , for the most - recent refinance , which went into effect in November .
" It would have to be an intervention from God if it turned around , " Gardner said .
The papers show that the monthly payments for mortgage , interest and taxes are $ 3,362 .
Johnnie Gardner 's monthly income from Social Security and his pension from 45 years as an electrician at the Oakland Naval Supply Center is $ 3,144 , while Joann Gardner made about $ 2,100 a month from her secretarial job .
How did Gardner think they would afford the mortgage ?
" We were supposed to be cashed out $ 15,000 , " she said .
" I thought with having that cushion , I 'd take a little out each time , and as Daddy 's checks came in , it would stack up to enough to pay for the mortgage , and my income would go for utilities and groceries . "
Instead , after the lender paid off credit cards for her and her father totaling about $ 14,000 , she only got $ 1,260 .
Then she lost her job in February because she was taking too much time off to tend to her parents .
Her mother has Alzheimer 's , and her father has arthritis and digestion problems .
When the first mortgage payment came due , Gardner realized they were in over their heads and called the lender .
" They said , ' We can't help you , it 's a done deal , you 're going to have to try to make those payments , ' " she said .
Ian Kideyz , a spokesman for the Gardners ' mortgage broker , Apply4Homes of La Jolla , said the refinance helped the family because paying off the credit cards saved $ 666 in monthly payments , and their new mortgage payment of $ 3,007 ( not including taxes and insurance ) was only $ 133 more than their previous payment .
" I know they 're upset because they can't make the payments , but they were put in a better situation , " he said .
" Their monthly obligations have been reduced .
There were no excessive fees charged on this loan . "
Chris Orlando , a spokesman for Argent Mortgage Co. of Irvine ( Orange County ) , said , " Argent is a wholesale lender , which means the company had no direct interaction with the customer .
We deal through independent brokers and they coordinate with their clients .
The loan was approved within our underwriting guidelines based on documented income . "
Because of her Alzheimer 's disease , Estelle Gardner does n't always remember that the house is in jeopardy , but sometimes she has moments of insight on the family 's situation .
" I would hate to have to go to glory and leave them in the condition where they lose this home , " she said .
" I always kept up my bills . "

" This was my favorite wedding gift of all time , " Vanessa Hahn said as she packed up her Cuisinart toaster , along with the few possessions still in her " fairy - tale " Fairfield home .
In front of the spacious house hung a " For Sale " sign -- one of several in the subdivision .
In a few hours , Vanessa and her toddler , Jonah , would leave for good to join her husband , Jeff , in Los Angeles , where he'd found a steady job .
Jeff
Hahn had already driven a U - Haul full of their furniture down the previous week , after the couple realized they could no longer make ends meet in the Bay Area .
Their monthly mortgage payments are now $ 5,000 -- about the same as their take - home income .
Jeff 's business of importing automotive parts for racing cars had failed to take off as quickly as he had hoped , and ate up all his savings .
Vanessa 's work as a behavioral therapist for autistic children is n't particularly high - paying ; in fact , she 'd recently switched to working in day care so she could bring Jonah along and cut down on child care bills .
They missed several mortgage payments .
They put the house on the market without generating any interest .
Then Jeff found the Los Angeles job .
" This is the only way to get out of this situation we 're in , " she said .
" No one wants to leave an area they 're so fond of . "
Jeff
Hahn bought the house , a nicely laid - out decade - old four - bedroom Colonial in a neighborhood of classic two - story homes , three years ago for $ 495,000 .
Later that year , he met Vanessa , they fell in love and started a family .
" When I first bought the house , everything was too good to be true , " Jeff recalled .
" No money down , instantly gaining $ 10,000 in equity .
Written in very small print was that the loan will adjust in two years .
Everybody I talked to said it would only be a ( minimal ) increase . "
Instead his two loans , initially totaling $ 2,200 a month , hit $ 3,700 last September .
When he tried to refinance , Hahn found out that he had been a victim of identity theft .
And , as a newly self - employed person , he had to produce extra documentation on his income .
All that slowed down the " refi " process for several months , during which the couple scrimped and borrowed to make the larger payments .
Several loans fells through for various technicalities .
By the time a new loan finally came through in March , not only had the subprime mess caused banks to tighten their lending standards , but the home 's value had dipped .
Jeff had borrowed against the home 's equity to pay off some bills and start his business .
He also took out money to cover closing costs for the new $ 570,000 loan .
The 40 - year fixed - rate loan , at an interest rate of 10.5 percent , carries monthly payments of $ 5,000 .
It was underwritten by BNC Mortgage of Irvine ( Orange County ) , a subsidiary of Wall Street firm Lehman Bros .
BNC said through a spokesman that it is a responsible lender and works hard to ensure that loans meet its underwriting guidelines .
Why did Hahn accept a loan with higher monthly payments ?
" I was using credit cards to subsidize the payments " on the existing mortgage , he said .
" I was about to miss a payment .
My lender said , ' Take the loan , because it will save your credit , that 's the first issue .
Then you can sell the house . ' "
The Hahns have not made any payments on the loan since it was funded in March .
" Honestly , I gave up once ( monthly payments ) hit $ 5,000 , " Jeff Hahn said .
" I said I can't do this . "
They have not received a notice of default -- the first step in the foreclosure process -- although they have received numerous calls and letters from Chase , which services the mortgage .
" If people do n't make payments early in the mortgage , we try to act very quickly to contact them , " said Chase spokesman Tom Kelly .
" We need to talk to the person to find out what 's going on . "
The Hahns put their house on the market , only to discover that real estate prices were spiraling downward in their area .
Their house , which had been appraised for $ 630,000 in January , was now worth less .
They started out listing it at $ 575,000 , and now have dropped the price to $ 555,000 .
Selling for less than the outstanding mortgage is called a " short sale " and requires bank approval .
It does not hurt a homeowner 's credit as much as a foreclosure , but the late payments still appear on credit reports , and homeowners can end up liable for extra taxes .
Chase 's Kelly was unable to say what the status was of the Hahns ' request for a short sale , but he said in general it takes 45 to 60 days to get a decision .
So far , the Hahns have n't received any offers .
" My neighbor is selling his house for $ 505,000 , " Hahn said .
" My Realtor wants me to drop my price another 100 grand . "
The job in Los Angeles seemed like one way to get financial stability .
What if the house goes into foreclosure ?
" We 're hoping it sells before it goes down that road , " Vanessa Hahn said .
" We 're in limbo now , doing what we can . "
Jeff
Hahn said he is bitter about his experience with home ownership .
" I 've probably wasted $ 90,000 over the past three years and have nothing to show for it , " he said .
" I lost my house , have to relocate my family and ruined my credit .
Now my family will probably never own a house again because we will be considered even more of a risk in the future . "

Monthly net income : About $ 5,000 a month .
House : Four - bedroom in Fairfield , purchased in 2004 for $ 495,000 .
Mortgage : Total owed on house is now $ 570,000 ; monthly payments are $ 5,000 .
Status :
Three months behind on mortgage ; house on market for $ 555,000 .
Carlos Cil , 32 , cherishes his Hispanic heritage , wearing embroidered shirts from his native Guatemala , dancing with an Aztec troupe and decorating his house with colorful artifacts from home , as well as pieces from his wife Flore 's native Peru .
When he bought a house two years ago , he trusted his mortgage broker because she 's from Mexico , so he figured she would look out for a fellow immigrant .
Cil told the broker he could only afford $ 2,200 a month .
He makes $ 2,600 a month as a painter for the Berkeley Unified School District , but is accustomed to picking up extra jobs to supplement his income so he figured he could stretch for a bit .
His wife stays home full time with their 13 - month - old son , Brandon .
Cil bought a three - bedroom home in Vallejo for $ 450,000 with no down payment .
The mortgage brokerage acted as his real estate agent .
He said he was told his monthly payments would be $ 2,600 a month .
The day he signed the loan papers , he found out the payments would be $ 2,900 a month , not including taxes and insurance .
Cil said he balked , but the brokerage assured him that he 'd easily be able to refinance in less than a year to lower his payments .
Reza Khan , an official with Brokaw Capital Financing in San Jose , which brokered the loan , said his company went out of its way to look out for Cil 's best interests .
It did not include any prepayment penalties , even though those would have earned it more money , Khan said , thus giving Cil more flexibility to refinance .
The home was appraised at $ 465,000 at the time of sale and then sold for $ 450,000 , less a $ 10,000 seller credit arranged by Brokaw .
" So in reality he got this house for $ 25,000 below market , back in 2005 when the market was booming , " Khan said .
" In that market , that was a great deal . "
Khan said Cil signed a letter saying his income was sufficient for the loan .
In such " stated income " loans , lenders do not verify the income , and charge a higher rate because the loans are riskier .
Cil paid an interest rate of 7.15 percent on his primary loan and 9.75 percent on his secondary loan , Khan said .
" We 've done everything by the book and we have every documentation to back it up , " Khan said .
As has happened in many outlying parts of the Bay Area , home prices in Vallejo softened .
" After one year , I could n't refinance because the value of the houses is not really high here in the neighborhood , " Cil said .
His brother , who had been staying with the couple and paying rent , moved out , which reduced their income .
Cil 's initial mortgage payments did not include an impound account for insurance and property taxes .
That was added about four months ago , bringing the monthly payments to $ 3,500 .
The loan is set to adjust still higher in September , when its two - year interest - only period will be up ; he 's not sure how much higher it will go .
Cil was determined not to miss a payment .
He said he has been working 12 to 16 hours almost every Saturday and Sunday on extra painting jobs -- and he has kept current with the payments .
The couple did everything they could to economize , getting rid of their cable TV service , landline phone , and even taking bulbs out of light fixtures to cut electricity costs .
" Saving every little bit of money helps , " Cil said , pointing to the tomatoes and chile peppers they grow in the sunny yard , along with marigolds for Día de los Muertos .
Keeping up with the payments has proven to be a saving grace .
Cil 's steady payment record means he can qualify to refinance through Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America , a nonprofit that has secured $ 1 billion from banks such as Bank of America and Citibank to help convert subprime mortgages into long - term loans with fixed rates .
He should be able to get a 30 - year fixed - rate loan at an interest rate of 1 point below market rate ( about 5.75 percent ) with no prepayment penalties , according to Winifred Gant , director of the assistance corporation 's Oakland office .
According to standard mortgage calculators , that would put Cil 's monthly payments at $ 2,626 a month -- still a stretch .
Cil said they might rent out rooms if the payments prove high .
" He 's been making payments on time , which is a plus for him even though it 's really difficult for him to do that , " Gant said .
" He 's had no late payments on his mortgage .
Clearly he 's made every effort even at the expense of not paying something else .
We can help people with late payments , but this is better . "
Cil said he is hopeful that the new loan will work out .
" I keep my spirits up , " he said .
" I do n't want to lose the house .
It would be really sad to lose it when I 've worked so hard . "

I just got another one of those Very Annoying messages .
One where you send an email to the very useful customer service email address for a company and they respond with a stock template
" We are unable to discuss account matters via email , please call our contact centre " .
Which is of course another way of saying " we live under the mistaken impression that email is less secure than the phone , so please contact our contact centre , press loads of irritating buttons , pay a premium rate , listen to annoying hold music and adverts and generally waste your time " .
Especially when I can send email for free then read the response at my leisure but taking up 15 minutes of my time listening to hold music on my mobile is certainly not free .
I wrote about this in 2003 and the arguments are just as valid today .
Since getting email in 1983 and sending on average 30 emails a day ( would have been less in 1983 , considerably more since 1987 when I 've used it on a daily basis for my job ) I figure I must have sent around 260,000 mails .
In that time , I can't think of a single instance where one has been maliciously intercepted en route .
Consider those odds of 260,000: 1 versus the odds of calling from an open plan office or in the street and everyone hearing the login details that you have to speak down the phone or indeed hearing the gist of why you are actually phoning and then using that to commit fraud .
I accept email is n't 100 % secure .
However , I believe the phone to be less secure than email .
So why can't we move on and accept email as a valid communication channel for secure conversations and then build the appropriate support and encryption channels around this rather than sticking our heads in the sand and resorting to plain text expensive 19th century communications technology ?

She has hit headlines for marital strife , designer dresses and her surprise role as an envoy to Libya , but France 's first lady , Cécilia Sarkozy , is now under scrutiny over her tonsils .
The French president , Nicolas Sarkozy , on holiday in the US , attended an informal family picnic at George Bush 's retreat in Maine on Saturday , sharing burgers in the name of Franco - US relations .
But his wife was unexpectedly absent , blaming a severe throat ailment that prevented her making the one - hour trip from the Sarkozys ' rented villa in New Hampshire .
The Bushes were sympathetic .
But the fact that Mrs Sarkozy was spotted shopping with friends on both Friday and Sunday raised eyebrows in France .
" Cécilia has set a new record for making a swift recovery , " a news reader said dryly on France Inter radio today .
" Cécilia coughs , France and America catch a cold ! " warned the regional paper , La Nouvelle République du Centre - Ouest .
The financial daily Les Echos said the incident heightened her reputation as " secretive , unpredictable , even disconcerting " .
Questions over Mrs Sarkozy 's official role have abounded after her unexpected foray into international politics by apparently helping to broker the release of Bulgarian medics imprisoned in Libya .
The Elysée has said her role and aims will be outlined in the autumn .
She said two years ago : " I do n't see myself as a first lady .
It bores me .
I 'm not politically correct . "
Talking to reporters last month , Mr Sarkozy said : " At the end of day , my only real worry is Cécilia . "
This is a set of functions used in the postfix MTA daemon but obviously well abstracted so that they can be easily used in other applications .
It works on a pointer and length model , although it also has " end pointer " and " amount left " variables .
The abstraction seems somewhat weird to me , as the underlying objects want to look and act like ( FILE *) and so have IO error flags ... and then on top of this are built Objects that are variable length strings and they 'll never do any IO .
It is upto the user of the library whether you have a fixed or dynamically sized buffer , and I think you can return failure if memory is n't available but the vstream.c and vstring .c implementations just assumes this can't happen .
The functions to act on the buffer are just copied APIs of ISO C ( FILE *) manipulators , str* and mem* ( with the addition of memcat ( ) ) .
Importantly there are no interfaces for removing data or substituting data in the string ( you could probably do remove from the end of the string easily by playing with the pointers and counters , but you 'd have to write your own function for it ) .
There is no way to access anything but the entire string , using the API , or add data anywhere but the end of the string .
There is an interface for using netstrings , but instead of the simple begin and end semantics in Vstr the interface overloads the string interface ... so you have to say netstring_memcpy ( ... ) which will copy data and encapsulate it as a netstring .
It 's also worth noting that the counters are of type " int " , and the negative bit is used in the code ... so it 's not possible to have a string bigger than INT_MAX .
The printf like functions are implemented by parsing the format string and then passing known good formats through to the host implementation sprintf ( ) ( after requesting enough space to hold them ) .
It does n't accept long long or long doulbe types , i18n argument number specifiers or thousand seperator modifiers .
Last Sunday ’s deadly shootout in a Baghdad neighborhood involving the American private security firm , BlackwaterUSA , plunged into sharp Western focus the often violent conduct of U.S. private armies operating in Iraq since the 2003 invasion .
Armed with automatic weapons and virtually immunity from scrutiny and prosecution , the alpha mercs from Blackwater have acquired a notorious reputation across Iraq as a deadly , apathetic even anarchistic force .
Surprisingly , Blackwater ’s henious reputation has been reiterated by other private security companies as well .
The latest incident has sparked one of the most bitter , public disputes ever between the Maliki regime and American occupiers .
Accusations are stark and aimed exclusively at BlackwaterUSA .
In short , they ’re accused of going on an unprovoked killing spree in a recently stabilized Baghdad neighborhood , and it was not the first time or place it ’s happened .
The U.K’s Independent has the story :
Hassan Jabar Salman , a lawyer , was shot four times in the back , his car riddled with eight more bullets , as he attempted to get away from their convoy .
Yesterday , sitting swathed in bandages at Baghdad 's Yarmukh Hospital , he recalled scenes of horror .
" I saw women and children jump out of their cars and start to crawl on the road to escape being shot , " said Mr Salman .
" But still the firing kept coming and many of them were killed .
I saw a boy of about 10 leaping in fear from a minibus , he was shot in the head .
His mother was crying out for him , she jumped out after him , and she was killed .
People were afraid . "
At the end of the prolonged hail of bullets , Nisoor Square was a scene of carnage with bodies strewn around smouldering wreckage .
Ambulances trying to pick up the wounded found their path blocked by crowds fleeing the gunfire .
Yesterday , the death toll from the incident , according to Iraqi authorities , stood at 28 .
And it could rise higher , say doctors , as some of the injured , hit by high - velocity bullets at close quarter , are unlikely to survive .
Blackwater and the US State Department maintain that the guards opened fire in self - defence as they reacted to a bomb blast and then sniper fire .
Amid continuing accusations and recriminations ,
The Independent has tried to piece together events on that day .
The reports we got from members of the public , Iraqi security personnel and government officials , as well as our own research , leads to a markedly different scenario than the American version .
There was a bomb blast .
But it was too far away to pose any danger to the Blackwater guards , and their State Department charges .
We have found no Iraqi present at the scene that saw or heard sniper fire .
Witnesses say the first victims of the shootings were a couple with their child , the mother and infant meeting horrific deaths , their bodies fused together by heat after their car caught fire .
The contractors , according to this account , also shot Iraqi soldiers and police and Blackwater then called in an attack helicopter from its private air force , which inflicted further casualties .
Blackwater disputes most of this .
In a statement , the company declared that those killed were , " armed insurgents and our personnel acted lawfully and appropriately in a war zone protecting American lives . "
The day after the killings , Mirenbe Nantongo , a spokeswoman for the US embassy , said the Blackwater team had " reacted to a car bombing " .
The embassy 's information officer , Johann Schmonsees , stressed " the car bomb was in proximity to the place where State Department personnel were meeting , and that was the reason why Blackwater responded to the incident . "
Not surprisingly , those on the receiving end of the violence tell a completely different story .
Mr. Salman said when the shooting began , he had turned into the Nisoor Square right behind the Blackwater convoy :
" There were eight foreigners in four utility vehicles , I heard an explosion in the distance and then the foreigners started shouting and signaling for us to go back .
I turned the car around and must have driven about a hundred feet when they started shooting .
My car was hit with 12 bullets .
It turned over .
Four bullets hit me in the back and another in the arm .
Why they opened fire ?
I do not know .
No one , I repeat , no one , had fired at them .
The foreigners had asked us to go back and I was going back in my car , so there was no reason for them to shoot . "
Muhammed Hussein lost a brother in the shooting and narrowly escaped death himself .
" My brother was driving and we saw a black convoy ahead of us .
Then I saw my brother suddenly slump in the car .
I dragged him out of the car and saw he had been shot in the chest .
I tried to hide us both from the firing , but then I realised he was already dead . "
Another resident , Jawad Karim
Ali was on his way to pick up his aunt from Yarmukh Hospital when the shooting started .
His windshield was blown out by the percussion of gunfire , chards of glass cutting his face :
" Then I was hit on my left shoulder by bullets , two of them another one went past my face .
Now my aunt is out of hospital and I am sitting here .
There was a big bang further away but no shots before the security people fired , and they just kept firing . "
Incidents such as last week ’s Baghdad " Bloody Sunday " have been happening in Iraq for years with most of the smaller shootings usually going unreported .
However , due to the high number of victims in this latest episode , the Nisoor Square incident has morphed into a test of sovereignty between the powers of the Iraqi government and the U.S. occupiers .
The Iraqi Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , said : " We will not tolerate the killing of our citizens in cold blood . "
The shooting was , he said , the seventh of its kind involving Blackwater .
These days , Blackwater ’s reputation precedes their arrival wherever it goes .
Its recognizable caravans are known afar by children and senior citizens alike .
Even outside of their vehicles , Blackwater personnel are recognizable from their " uniform " of wraparound sunglasses and body armour over dark coloured sweatshirts and helmets .
Employees are thought to earn about $ 600 ( £ 300 ) per day .
It was the lynching of four of the company 's employees in 2004 , which led to the bloody confrontation in Fallujah .
The men's bodies were set on fire , dragged through the streets and then hung from a bridge .
Nisoor Square is located in the Mansour District of Baghdad , once one of the most fashionable districts of Baghdad , with roads flanked by shops selling expensive goods , restaurants and art galleries .
In the midst of sectarian bloodletting between Shias and Sunnis earlier this year , dead bodies would be regularly strewn in the streets .
Since that time , a semblance of safety has returned , and Mansour was recently held up by the Bush regime as an example of how the US military " surge " was cutting the violence .
Now ... not so much .
That erroneous theory garners little credence in Baghdad .
Asked about the witness accounts , Ali al - Dabbagh , an Iraqi government spokesman , confirmed : " The traffic policemen were trying to open the road for them .
It was a crowded square and one small car did not stop , it was moving very slowly .
They started shooting randomly , there was a couple and their child inside the car and they were hit . "
To the depths of my darkest nightmares could I ever envision living in what has literally become the bloodiest place on Earth .
I have n’t a doubt in my mind that for the Iraqi people , the pre-invasion days of living under Saddam Hussein 's iron fist , in tragic irony , are now looked upon as the proverbial good ol ’ days .
And , this apocalyptic hell on earth is inflicted upon these innocents ; in our names , as I speak .

Aerodynamic scaling rules that explain how flight varies according to weight and wing loading have been used to compare general speeds of a wide range of flyers , from the smallest insects to the largest aircraft .
In a paper published this week in the open access journal PLoS Biology , Thomas Alerstam , Mikael Rosen , and colleagues from the University of Lund in Sweden analyze the flight speeds of 138 bird species and overturn the general assumption that maximum flight speed of a species is solely determined by such rules .
Flight speed does n't just depend on the size of the bird ( mass and wing loading ) , but also reflects functional constraints and the evolutionary lineage of the species in question .
The authors argue that only empirical measurements of flight speeds enable you to evaluate how general such aerodynamic rules really are .
They used tracking radar measurements of the cruising speeds of migrating birds ( collected by themselves and others ) to do the analysis and provide the comprehensive dataset with the paper ( e.g. this contains the flight speed of approximately one - third of all European bird species ) .
Their analysis reveals that the difference between the speed of small and large birds is not as great as expected ; they suggest that this surprising result is likely to be the result of disadvantages associated with very slow speeds among smaller birds and with very fast speeds for larger birds .
They also show that the evolutionary history of the species helps explain much of the variation in flight speed : species of the same group tend to fly at similar characteristic speeds .
For example , birds of prey and herons had slow flight speeds , on average , given their mass and wing loading , whereas the average speed for songbirds and shorebirds was faster than would be predicted .
This study suggests that there are different functional adaptations affecting flight differently among different types of bird , and that there exists a diversity of cruising flight characteristics among birds that remain to be explored and understood .

On what , then , do psychiatrists base their sweeping judgments ?
Most point to The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders — the fundamental handbook of psychiatry .
Yet a glance at the manual reveals that the diagnostic criteria for shyness are far from clear .
The third edition , which was published in 1980 , said that a person could receive a diagnosis of what was then called “ social phobia ” if he was afraid of eating alone in restaurants , avoided public restrooms or was concerned about hand - trembling when writing checks .
The same guidelines could hardly apply to youngsters heading to kindergarten , children not yet potty - trained and toddlers just learning to eat .
So in 1987 , the revised third edition of the manual expanded the list of symptoms by adding anticipated concern about saying the wrong thing , a trait known to just about everyone on the planet .
The diagnostic bar was set so low that even a preschooler could trip over it .
Self - help books and magazine articles further widened the definition of social anxiety disorder to include symptoms like test anxiety , aversion to writing on the blackboard and shunning of team sports .
These ridiculously loose criteria led to more diagnoses , until social anxiety disorder in children began to look as if it were spreading like the common cold among second graders .
Then , having alerted the masses to their worrisome avoidance of public restrooms , the psychiatrists needed a remedy .
Right on cue , GlaxoSmithKline , the maker of Paxil , declared in the late 1990s that its antidepressant could also treat social anxiety and , presumably , self - consciousness in restaurants .
Nudged along by a public - awareness campaign ( “ Imagine Being Allergic to People ” ) that cost the drug maker more than $ 92 million in one year alone ( $ 3 million more than Pfizer spent that year promoting Viagra ) , social anxiety quickly became the third most diagnosed mental illness in the nation , behind only depression and alcoholism .
Studies put the total number of children affected at 15 percent — higher than the one in eight who psychiatrists had suggested were shy enough to need medical help .
This diagnosis was frequently irresponsible , and it also had human costs .
After being prescribed Paxil or Zoloft for their shyness and public - speaking anxiety , a disturbingly large number of children , studies found , began to contemplate suicide and to suffer a host of other chronic side effects .
This class of antidepressants , known as S.S.R.I.’s , had never been tested on children .
Belatedly , the Food and Drug Administration agreed to require a “ black box ” warning on the drug label , cautioning doctors and parents that the drugs may be linked to suicide risk in young people .

Two Democratic senators warned Monday that they might delay confirming President Bush 's choice to be the next attorney general unless the White House turns over documents relating to several investigations , a move that could provoke the kind of confirmation fight the Bush administration was hoping to avoid .
Bush announced the selection of Michael Mukasey , a retired federal judge from New York who has presided over several high - profile terrorism trials , during a morning Rose Garden ceremony .
He urged the Senate to confirm Mukasey promptly as the nation 's 81st attorney general , succeeding Alberto Gonzales , who resigned last month under withering attacks from Democrats on Capitol Hill .
" Judge Mukasey is clear - eyed about the threat our nation faces , " Bush said , with the 66 - year - old former jurist by his side .
" As a judge and a private lawyer , he 's written on matters of constitutional law and national security .
He knows what it takes to fight this war effectively . "
If confirmed , Mukasey will take over a Justice Department that has been burdened by the weight of congressional inquiries into the firing of federal prosecutors and the administration 's domestic wiretapping program .
In brief remarks after Bush spoke , he pledged to give the department 's lawyers " the support and the leadership they deserve . "
At a time when Democrats are bitterly at odds with the administration over the war in Iraq , the selection of Mukasey - a Washington outsider who met Bush for the first time during an hourlong interview at the White House on Sept. 1 - seemed to signal that the administration is looking to move past the partisanship that characterized Gonzales ' tenure .
But two Democrats who will have a powerful say over whether Mukasey gets confirmed - Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Chuck Schumer of New York - pledged to use the nomination to pressure the White House into turning over information that the Senate Judiciary Committee has been seeking on domestic wiretapping and the treatment of military detainees .
" All I want is the material we need to ask some questions about the former attorney general 's conduct , on torture and warrantless wiretapping , so we can legitimately ask , ' Here 's what was done in the past - what will you do ? ' " said Leahy , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , which will hold Mukasey 's confirmation hearings .
Whether that was a negotiating tactic or a threat that could turn into an all - out battle , was unclear .
Leahy did say he has told White House counsel Fred Fielding that the nomination cannot go forward without the information , and that " cooperation with the White House would be central " to scheduling hearings on Mukasey .
Schumer , for his part , seemed to take the role of mediator between Leahy and the White House .
On Sunday , Schumer - who first floated Mukasey 's name with the White House as a potential Supreme Court nominee four years ago - praised Mukasey as a potential consensus nominee .
On Monday , he said he had told Fielding that the White House would have to resolve Leahy 's concerns .
" Chairman Leahy 's concern is genuine , " Schumer said in an interview .
" He strongly defends the prerogatives of the committee .
I stressed that to both Fielding and Mukasey .
It would be much better for everyone concerned if they could reach an agreement . "
The White House is trying to cast the Mukasey confirmation as urgent and is calling on the Senate to put him in place at the Justice Department before lawmakers leave for their next recess , on Oct. 8 .
Most Democrats reacted with caution Monday .
Several , like Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , said Mukasey will have to prove that he is independent of Bush and that he can repair the damage done to the department by Gonzales , whom many Democrats regarded as a crony of the president .
Others , like Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware , sounded surprised by what they regarded as an unusual White House overture .
Biden said he was " pleased that President Bush put aside his old habits and picked an outside professional to nominate as attorney general , rather than a member of his own circle . "
The Man , the Mercenary
Ted Roelof of the Grand Rapids Press has an extensive look into the reclusive Prince and a life built on ultra-conservative tenets and money .
Prince , son of Holland industrialist Edgar Prince and an ex-Navy SEAL , tapped his inherited wealth in 1996 to found a little - noticed North Carolina security firm that would become Blackwater USA .
Family connections helped .
As brother to former Michigan GOP chairwoman Betsy DeVos and brother - in - law to her husband , 2006 GOP gubernatorial candidate Dick DeVos , Prince had access to Capitol Hill power brokers .
But his business plan did not crystallize until the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
With the U.S. decision to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq , a changing military looked to the private sector to complete a variety of missions .
Blackwater was in prime position to capitalize .
Roelof 's Blackwater descriptor as a " security firm " is akin to calling Wal - Mart the mom and pop corner store .
According to David Isenberg with the British American Security Information Council ( BASIC ) , Blackwater is a private military company .
Isenberg should know , he has been researching and writing on private military companies ( PMC ) since the early 1990s .
George Washington University professor of political science Deborah Avant had this to say about Prince in Roelof 's piece -
" Blackwater is owned by one guy , who is very rich , " Avant said .
" He 's very connected .
He 's very tied to the Christian right . "
Prince 's entire history is seeped in the ultra - conservative agenda , from political beliefs to campaign donations , Prince has been a stalwart of the Republican money machine .
In 1992 , Erik Prince and his father split politically with his sister , Betsy DeVos , who was then 5th District GOP chairwoman .
They backed Pat Buchanan for president .
She supported President George H.W. Bush .
As a 22 - year - old senior at Hillsdale , Prince explained his decision to The ( Grand Rapids ) Press .
" I interned with the Bush administration for six months , " he said .
" I saw a lot of things I did n't agree with -- homosexual groups being invited in , the budget agreement , the Clean Air Act , those kind of bills .
I think the administration has been indifferent to a lot of conservative concerns . " ...
At age 19 , Prince made his first political contribution : A $ 15,000 donation to the GOP .
By 2006 , his total contributions had swelled to more than $ 235,000 -- virtually all to Republican or conservative causes .
The Questionable Company
The problem is n't Prince 's money , personal political beliefs or his sister and brother - in - law , fondly known here in Michigan as Mr. and Mrs. Amway Guy .
As much as I may not agree with Prince , I respect his right to believe whatever he wants and have as much money as he wants .
The real problem is with what he 's turned Blackwater into , how the company is being used to our ridicule country 's justice system and the careless way in which its employees are being treated .
According to BASIC's Isenberg , private military companies like Blackwater use political campaign contributions and lobbying firms to influence the government .
On the lobbying front it was reported that Washington , D.C. - based PR and lobbying firm Alexander Strategy Group is working on behalf of Blackwater USA .
Though ASG recently announced it was shutting down because of its ties to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff and former House majority leader Tom DeLay , who has been indicted on money - laundering charges .
As if that 's not bad enough , The Nation 's Jeremy Scahill has done extensive research on Blackwater USA .
Up till now , the facts have been kept quiet because they are so scary .
Consider this from Scahill 's August ' 06 report -
Government records recently obtained by The Nation reveal that the Bush Administration has paid Blackwater more than $ 320 million since June 2004 to provide " diplomatic security " services globally .
The massive contract is the largest known to have been awarded to Blackwater to date and reveals how the Administration has elevated a once - fledgling security firm into a major profiteer in the " war on terror . " ...
Blackwater was originally slated to be paid $ 229.5 million for five years , according to a State Department contract list .
Yet as of June 30 , just two years into the program , it had been paid a total of $ 321,715,794 .
When confronted with this apparent $ 100 million discrepancy , the State Department could not readily explain it .
Blackwater 's two years of WPPS ( Worldwide Personal Protection Services , a little known State Department program ) earnings exceed many estimates of the company 's total government contracts , which the Virginian - Pilot recently put at $ 290 million combined since 2000 .
Six years ago the government paid Blackwater less than $ 250,000 .
With this surmounting evidence , it seems as if Blackwater is up to its eyeballs in questionable transactions and the whole thing reeks of collusion and conspiracy .
The Sins of the Employer visit kill the Employees
To date , according to SourceWatch , Blackwater USA has receieved no -bid government contracts in Iraq , Afghanistan , and post - Katrina New Orleans , all from George W. Bush 's administration .
Many Americans are perfectly willing to sit in their living rooms and cluck their tongues when they hear of corporate scandal and incest .
For most , it 's a problem within the boardroom , and even if they wanted too , what could they really do about it ?
That 's what was going on with Blackwater until that fateful day in Fallujah on March 31st , 2004 .
The world turned on their televisions and were met with a gruesome image of charred American bodies , burned and chopped up , hung in pieces to a bridge over the Euphrates River .
The poor soldiers , everyone said .
Jaws hit the floor when it was discovered that those poor men were not U.S. soldiers , they were Blackwater USA employees .
Even more stunning than the manner in which they died , is why they died .
In a separate piece for The Nation , Scahill 's Blood is Thicker than Blackwater reveals the truth .
According to former Blackwater officials , Blackwater , Regency and ESS were engaged in a classic war - profiteering scheme .
Blackwater was paying its men $ 600 a day but billing Regency $ 815 , according to the Raleigh News and Observer .
...
All this was shady enough -- but the real danger for ( murdered Blackwater employee Scott ) Helvenston and the others lay in Blackwater 's decision to cut corners to make even more money .
The original contract between Blackwater / Regency and ESS , obtained by The Nation , recognized that " the current threat in the Iraqi theater of operations " would remain " consistent and dangerous , " and called for a minimum of three men in each vehicle on security missions " with a minimum of two armored vehicles to support ESS movements . "
[ Emphasis added . ]
But on March 12 , 2004 , Blackwater and Regency signed a subcontract , which specified security provisions identical to the original except for one word : " armored . "
Blackwater deleted it from the contract .
" When they took that word ' armored ' out , Blackwater was able to save $ 1.5 million in not buying armored vehicles , which they could then put in their pocket , " says attorney Miles .
" These men were told that they'd be operating in armored vehicles .
Had they been , I sincerely believe that they'd be alive today .
They were killed by insurgents literally walking up and shooting them with small - arms fire .
This was not a roadside bomb , it was not any other explosive device .
It was merely small - arms fire , which could have been repelled by armored vehicles . "
When the facts of the case revealed themselves , the families of the murdered men were horrified .
It was discovered that Scott Helveston and other Blackwater employees knew about the shortcuts and mistreatment , and attempted to bring it to Blackwater 's attention .
Their complaints were swept under the rug and the families would not find out about it until after that fateful day in Fallujah .
Erik Prince and Blackwater played the role of grieving employer well , until the families wanted some answers .
After the killings , Katy Helvenston joined the families of Mike Teague , Jerko Zovko and Wesley Batalona in grieving and in seeking details about the incident .
Blackwater founder Erik Prince personally delivered money to some of the families for funeral expenses , and the company moved to get the men's wives and children benefits under the government 's Defense Base Act ... ...
But then things started to get strange .
Blackwater held a memorial service for the men at its compound .
The families were gathered in a conference room , where they thought they would be told how the men had died .
The Zovko family asked Blackwater to see the " After Action Report " detailing the incident .
" We were actually told , " recalls Zovko 's mother , Danica , " that if we wanted to see the paperwork of how my son and his co-workers were killed that we'd have to sue them . "
Thus began the legal battle between Blackwater and the dead men's families .
In one of its few statements on the suit , Blackwater spokesperson Chris Bertelli said , " Blackwater hopes that the honor and dignity of our fallen comrades are not diminished by the use of the legal process . "
Katy Helvenston calls that " total BS in my opinion , " and says that the families decided to sue only after being stonewalled , misled and lied to by the company .
" Blackwater seems to understand money .
That 's the only thing they understand , " she says .
" They have no values , they have no morals .
They 're whores .
They 're the whores of war . "
Prince and Blackwater do seem to understand money quite well .
They hired convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff 's former employer , Greenberg Traurig , the influential DC law firm as their lead counsel .
With their vast financial resources , Blackwater 's legal team has managed to delay the case for almost 3 years now with tricky moves and one fluff motion after another .
According to another article in The Nation , in early October 2006 , Blackwater dumped Greenberg Traurig and hired former Whitewater investigator Kenneth Starr to file motions in front of the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the suit .
There are undeniable benefits to having Starr , the US Solicitor General under President George H.W. Bush , represent Blackwater - - a highly partisan GOP company -- in front of a Supreme Court stacked with Bush appointees .
Starr also has a personal connection to Blackwater .
Starr and Joseph Schmitz , the general counsel and chief operating officer of Blackwater 's parent company , the Prince Group , have both worked closely with the arch - conservative Washington Legal Foundation .
Since 1993
Starr has served on the legal policy advisory board of the organization for which Schmitz has frequently acted as a spokesperson and attorney .
The case is in front of the U.S. Supreme Court , and a decision is being awaited .
U.S. Congressman Henry Waxman ( D - California ) chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is holding hearings into the allegations that Blackwater purposely shorted its employees of necessary equipment .
As the country awaits the two decisions , we need to stare the grim reality of this situation of corruption , greed , and complete disregard for American lives straight in the face and change the system .
The ultimate tragedy will be if we , the People , turn a blind eye and allow people like Erik Prince and corporations like Blackwater to continue to make a farce out of our brave men and women and the laws that exist to protect them .

There is new hope that Earth , if not the life on it , might survive an apocalypse five billion years from now .
That is when , scientists say , the Sun will run out of hydrogen fuel and swell temporarily more than 100 times in diameter into a so - called red giant , swallowing Mercury and Venus .
Astronomers are announcing that they have discovered a planet that seems to have survived the puffing up of its home star , suggesting there is some hope that Earth could survive the aging and swelling of the Sun .
The planet is a gas giant at least three times as massive as Jupiter .
It orbits about 150 million miles from a faint star in Pegasus known as V 391 Pegasi .
But before that star blew up as a red giant and lost half its mass , the planet must have been about as far from its star as Earth is from the Sun  about 90 million miles  according to calculations by an international team of astronomers led by Roberto Silvotti of the Observatorio Astronomico di Capodimonte in Naples , Italy .
Then , just after the start of the Iraq war , “ There was a miniburst of optimism ” that capitalism was leading to democracy after all , Mr. Mandelbaum said , with three popular uprisings in Ukraine , Georgia and Kyrgyzstan and elections in Gaza , Lebanon and Egypt in 2005 .
The burst quickly fizzled though , when the democratic “ revolutions ” proved short - lived and prone to violence and corruption .
Now some scholars argue that a free market can even end up undermining democracy .
“ Capitalism does n’t necessarily lead toward democracy at all , ” Mr. Scott said .
“ The one thing that you can say is that capitalism is going to relentlessly produce inequality of income , and eventually that is going to become incompatible with democracy . ”
That is where political leadership and institutions come in .
Another problem , said Lord Dahrendorf , a research professor at the Social Science Research Center Berlin , is that when democracy fails to deliver the economic goods , people begin to doubt its value .
“ Few things seem more difficult and yet few things are more important for sustainable liberty , ” he wrote recently , “ than to separate capitalism and democracy in people ’s minds . ”
Otherwise , instead of mutually reinforcing each other , the two spiral into disenchantment .
Even if capitalism does not assure democracy ’s existence , many economists and political scientists say it creates a hospitable atmosphere and helps democratic systems withstand turmoil .
Nor should we forget , Mr. Stiglitz counsels , that “ the movement from closed to open society is a very big change . ”
To compete economically , a nation has to be plugged into the global information network , which exposes its citizens to other political systems and cultures .
Reinforcing that trend , Mr. Mandelbaum said , is that the “ habits and values of a market economy , when transferred to the political sphere , make for a democracy . ”
But China , he acknowledges , is “ the big enchilada , the big test . ”
Even with its growing middle class , it still has a billion poor people .
Pressure for democracy will increase , but so will push back from China ’s leaders .
So far they have been successful .
“ The Chinese government is pretty good at buying off intellectuals and the middle class who fear disorder much more than they want political participation , ” Mr. Fukuyama said .
He added that he would not be surprised if China and even Russia were to come up with a “ new type of authoritarian ideology that tries to justify ” their non-Western systems .
He has already heard the outlines of such arguments — which echo the “ Asian values ” idea of non-Western cultural norms that lead to different development paths — from Chinese intellectuals and Russian policy makers .
Where the theorizing spills out of the classroom , though , is around the question of what can be done to influence the process .
This is where stark differences appear , not between liberals and conservatives , but between the professors and policy makers .
As Mr. Fukuyama said , one point on which he has differed from neoconservatives in the Bush administration is that , “ I think , in general , the United States ca n’t do very much . ”
[ Squeakland ] the non universals
Hi David -- Someone once asked Mohandas Gandhi what he thought of Western Civilization , and he said he " thought it would be a good idea ! "
Similarly , if you asked me what I thought of University Education , I would say that " it would be a good idea ! " .

So where is the difficulty ?
A lack of proven > agreed teaching methods , a perception of elitism , or the competing > desire we all feel to make sure everyone leaves school with basic > literacy and numeracy ?
My perception of your first sentence is very different than yours .
Most educators in K - 8 do not seem to know anything about calculus and precious little about geometry or algebra ( and their knowledge of arithmetic is rule - based not math - based ) so I do n't see whatever desires they might espouse about these progressions as having much substance .
I do think that one is likely to get much better instruction and coaching from music teachers and sports coaches -- in no small part because they are usually fluent practitioners , and do have some real contact with the entire chain of meaning and action of their subjects .
I do n't have deep direct scientific knowledge of the nature of the difficulties , just thousands of encounters with various educational systems around the world and educators over the last 35 + years .
So I could have just been continually unlucky in my travels ....
In the early 80's I went to Atari as its Chief Scientist to try to get some of Papert 's and my ideas into consumer electronics .
The Atari 800 and especially the 400 were tremendous computers for their price , and Brian Silverman made a great version of Logo to go on these machines .
( There were also Logos on most of the other 8 - bit micros . )
And , there was a Logo - vogue for a time , both in the US and in the UK .
Many early adopter teachers got Atari's or Apple IIs in their classrooms and got their students started on it .
This was exciting until examined closely .
Essentially none of the teachers actually understood enough mathematics to see what Logo was really about .
And for a variety of reasons Logo gradually slid away and disappeared .
We should look a bit at three different kinds of understanding : rote understanding , operational understanding , and meta-understanding .
If we leave out the majority of teachers who do n't really understand math in any strong way , we still find that the kinds of understandings that are left are not up to the task of being able to see the meaning and value of a new perspective on mathematics .
For example , it is possible to understand calculus a little in the narrow form in which it was learned , and still not be able to see " calculus " in a different form ( even if the new way is a stronger way to look at it ) .
Real fluency in a subject allows many of the most powerful ideas in the subject to be somewhat detached from specific forms .
This is meta-understanding .
For example , the school version of calculus is based on a numeric continuum and algebraic manipulations .
But the idea of calculus is not really strongly tied to this .
The idea has to do with separating out the similarities and differences of change to produce and allow much simpler and easier to understand relationships to be created .
This can be done so that the connection between one state and the next one of interest is a simple addition .
Actual continuity can be replaced by a notion of " you pick and then I pick " so that non-continuities do n't get seen .
This other view of calculus as a form of calculation was used by Babbage in his first " difference engines " because a computing machine that can do lots of additions for you can make this other way to look at calculus very practical and worthwhile .
The side benefit is that it is much easier to understand than the algebraic rubrics .
If we then add to this the idea of using vectors ( as " supernumbers " ) instead of regular numbers , we are able to dispense with coordinate systems except when convenient , and are able to operate in multiple dimensions .
All of this was worked out in the 19th century and quite a bit was adopted enthusiastically by science and is in main use today .
To cut to the chase , Seymour Papert ( who was a very good mathematician ) was one of the first to realize that this kind of math ( called " vector differential geometry " ) fit very well into young children 's thinking patterns , and that the new personal computers would be able to manifest Babbage 's dream to be able to compute and think in terms of an incremental calculus for complex change .
Any one fluent in mathematics can recognize this ( but it took a Papert to first point it out ) .
But , virtually no one without fluency in mathematics can recognize this .
And surveys have shown that less than 5 % of Americans are fluent in math or science .
Many of the 95 % were able to go through 16 years of schooling and successfully get a college degree without attaining any fluency in math or science .
This is not a matter of intelligence at all , but is more of a " two cultures " phenomenon .
So I am not able to agree with this sentence of yours : > This barrier is puzzling to me , as the key gatekeepers in education >( teachers , head teachers , inspectors , government education > departments ) are products of the university system , which seems to me > to exist to propagate and build on the hard ideas ( greek math , > relativity , quantum theory , sociology , musical harmony ... )
It is possible to learn about these ideas in university ( and outside of university ) , but I do n't know of any universities today whose goal it is to invest its graduates with fluency in these ideas or any other powerful ideas .
That is , the concept of a general education for the 21st century that should include these ideas does n't seem to be in any American university I 'm familiar with .
> If Logo , Etoys and OLPC can teach calculus to 10 - year - olds , and > calculus is essential to every engineering craft , and teachers love > encouraging students ' creativity , why are so many schools teaching > pupils to use word processors instead ?
The problem is that Logo , Etoys and OLPC can't teach calculus to 10 year olds .
The good news is that adults who understand the subject matter can indeed teach calculus to 10 year olds with the aid of Logo , Etoys and OLPC .
If you put a piano in a classroom , children will do something with it , and perhaps even produce a " chopsticks culture " .
But the music is n't in the piano .
It has to be brought forth from the children .
And the possibilities of music are not in the children , but right now has to be manifested in the teachers and other mentors .
( It took several centuries to develop keyboard technique , and much longer than that to invent and develop the rich genres of music of the last 6 centuries . )
Math and science were difficult to invent in the first place ( so Rousseau - like optimism for discovery learning is misplaced ) , and both subjects have been developed for centuries by experts .
Children need experts to help them , not retreaded social studies teachers .
One of the goals of 19th century education was to teach children how to learn from books .
This was a great idea because ( a ) oral instruction is quite inefficient ( b ) you can get around bad teachers ( c ) you can contact experts in ways that you might not be able to directly ( especially if they are deceased ) ( d ) you can self - pace ( e ) you can employ multiple perspectives on the subject matter ( f ) you are not in the quicksand of social norming , etc .
A small percentage of children still are able to learn from books , and similar small percentages of children can and do learn powerful ideas by themselves without much adult aid .
But since general education is primarily about helping to grow citizens who can try to become more civilized , the big work that has to be done is with those who are not inclined to learn powerful ideas of any kind .

It 's tricky to directly compare Apple 's Mac OS X Leopard and Microsoft 's Vista , because the two products will be sold to very different markets in different ways .
Here 's a look at how both differ in their prerelease marketing .
The biggest hurdle in directly comparing Mac OS X Leopard against Windows Vista is that Apple and Microsoft have very different marketing strategies , particularly when it comes to prerelease software .
Why is Apple so Secretive ?
described this in greater detail .
The Difference in the Known Knowns
Nearly all the public information available on Apple 's next version of Mac OS X comes from a brief slideshow presented at WWDC in October and repeated on Apple 's Leopard sneak peek website , while Vista has been in public beta for years , and its features are widely documented and have been extensively reviewed .
The public actually knows more about the features that have been cut from Vista than they do about the features that will actually ship in Leopard this spring .
In part , that 's because Microsoft repeatedly advertised its changing plans over the last six years , while Apple shipped regular new advances to Mac OS X that each unveiled a surprise of unanticipated new features .
Apple and Microsoft act out these roles because each suits the position and needs of the company .
Microsoft , as the reigning incumbent , is best served by making broad announcements of future intentions that pacify its user base into feeling comfortable with staying where they are .
Apple , as a minority challenger , is best served by playing its cards close to the chest , and then dramatically unveiling them with the greatest fanfare possible right when a product is available for sale .
The Reversal of Fortune
Interestingly , the tables are nearly reversed between the two companies in the music player market .
This fall , Apple announced full details of the next generation of its Shuffle and Nano , along with advanced plans for next spring 's iTV , while details on Microsoft 's Zune have been hard to find and shrouded in myth and hype .
Even Microsoft 's official PR webpage for Zune was short on meaty details and long on generalizations and marketing fluff .
Microsoft executives provided few details in interviews , and left published errors uncorrected .
CNET 's MP3.com prominently reported Microsoft as saying that the Zune pointedly would not play video at its release .
When I cited the CNET article in 10 iPod vs Zune Myths in the context of Microsoft 's leading Zune executive describing in his own words that portable video " was n't a big focus for the company , " I was cowardly attacked for supposedly inventing the idea by a Microsoft aligned Zune site .
Vaseline Hardball
If Microsoft hopes to slide its excessively restrictive DRM and other obvious product flaws under the radar using the distraction of hype and incomplete information , it can't cry when the snakes of misinformation it unleashes come back to bite it .
How hard would it have been to put together a straight forward web page of plainly stated features ?
As it stands , the company is either tragically incompetent or was simply floating the idea of unfinished video playback in order to gauge how much work they'd have to actually do before launch .
While Apple works to keep details of its products secret prior to their release , Microsoft 's marketing campaigns seeds the market with information that is long on hype and short on specifics , whether it ’s flamboyantly positive fluff about its own future plans , or fearsomely negative doubts and uncertainty about rivals .
This difference in prerelease marketing tactics also plays into an honest comparison between Vista and Leopard .
As Rumsfeld might have described , there are known knowns , known unknowns , and unknown unknowns with Apple , but with Microsoft , there are also unknown knowns , things we thought we knew that turned out later to not be the case .
A simpler word would be " misinformation , " with Vaporware and FUD as specific examples .
This gives Apple an advantage with Leopard over Vista , as well as with the iPod over the Zune : most people would rather be pleasantly surprised than disappointed .
This Series
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney said his office would respond later , while a Justice Department spokesman said , “ The department will continue to work closely with the Congress as they exercise their oversight functions , and we will review this matter in the spirit of that longstanding relationship . ”
Under the domestic eavesdropping program , the N.S.A. did not obtain warrants before listening in on phone calls and reading e-mail messages to and from Americans and others in the United States who the agency believes may be linked to Al Qaeda .
Only international communications — those into and out of the country — were monitored , according to administration officials .
The Senate panel ’s action comes after dramatic testimony last month by James B. Comey , former deputy attorney general , who described a March 2004 confrontation at the hospital bedside of John Ashcroft , then attorney general , between Justice Department officials and White House aides over the legality of the wiretapping program .
Before Mr. Comey ’s testimony , the White House had largely been able to fend off aggressive oversight of the N.S.A. wiretapping since it was first disclosed in December 2005 .
The Republican - controlled Congress held hearings last year , and even considered legislative proposals to curb the scope of the eavesdropping .
But Mr. Cheney repeatedly pressured Republican Congressional leaders to pull back .
When the Democrats won the 2006 midterm elections , many observers predicted that the N.S.A. program — which a federal judge declared unconstitutional — would be one of the first Bush administration operations to undergo new scrutiny .
But in January , the administration announced that it was placing the program under the legal framework of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , a move it had previously refused to consider .
The Democrats have largely focused on objections to the Iraq war in their first months in power , and have appeared reluctant to take aggressive steps to challenge policies on harsh interrogation practices , secret Central Intelligence Agency prisons and domestic wiretapping for fear of being labeled soft on terrorism .
For instance , at a confirmation hearing on June 19 for John A. Rizzo as general counsel of the C.I.A. , no member of the Senate Intelligence Committee directly challenged the agency ’s secret detention or harsh interrogation practices .
[ in the process of updating this for Silverlight 2.0 beta ]
Come with me on my journey of discovery of the new SilverLight technology .
I ’ll be learning by doing .
I ’ll create a full blown SilverLight application from ground up and share every step of the journey with you .
Everything i learn i will post right here in my blog and i’ll file it under the category “ Project SilverLight 1.1 ”
The “ End Goal ” of this project is to recreate iTunes as a silverlight / ajax.asp.net application
Below is a picture of Apple ’s iTunes application :
The “ project silverlight 1.1 ” is currently at this point , note that the wireframe is shown in a “ standard metallic ” theme taken from step ( 18 ) below .
[ clicking the picture will take you to the working sample ]
Here is another version of the wire - frame using the “ 5 minute wooden ” theme taken from step ( 18 ) below .

CodePlex is a great source code repository from a collaboration and management perspective .
It will make managing the code deployment so much easier .
" I do n't consider it a credible report , " Mr Bush told a White House press conference in response to a study published in the medical journal The Lancet .
" Neither does General Casey , neither do Iraqi officials , " he added , referring to George Casey , the top US general in Iraq .
The Iraqi government said the report 's death toll was " inflated " and " far from the truth " , but did not give its own figure for the deaths .
Mr Bush , who last December suggested there may have been 30,000 civilian deaths in Iraq , would not give a figure today for overall fatalities .
The study found that the equivalent of 2.5 % of Iraq 's population had been killed since fighting began more than three years ago .
The study , by the Johns Hopkins University 's Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore , was based on household interviews - not a body count - and was a follow - up to a report by the same group two years ago .
An Iraqi government spokesman , Ali al - Dabbagh , said in a statement that the toll in the report " exceeds the reality in an unreasonable way " .
The report " gives inflated numbers in a way that violates all rules of research and the precision required of research institutions " , he said .

1. Artificial General Intelligence ( AGI )
by Lifeboat Foundation Scientific Advisory Board member Michael Anissimov Transhumanists advocate the improvement of human capacities through advanced technology .
Not just technology as in gadgets you get from Best Buy , but technology in the grander sense of strategies for eliminating disease , providing cheap but high - quality products to the world ’s poorest , improving quality of life and social interconnectedness , and so on .
Technology we do n’t notice because it ’s blended in with the fabric of the world , but would immediately take note of its absence if it became unavailable .
( Ever tried to travel to another country on foot ? )
Technology need n’t be expensive  indeed , if a technology is truly effective it will pay for itself many times over .
Transhumanists tend to take a longer - than - average view of technological progress , looking not just five or ten years into the future but twenty years , thirty years , and beyond .
We realize that the longer you look forward , the more uncertain the predictions get , but one thing is quite certain : if a technology is physically possible and obviously useful , human ( or transhuman ! ) ingenuity will see to it that it gets built eventually .
As we gain ever greater control over the atomic structure of matter , our technological goals become increasingly ambitious , and their payoffs more and more generous .
Sometimes new technologies even make us happier in a long - lasting way : the Internet would be a prime example .
In the following list I take a look at what I consider the top ten transhumanist technologies .
Cryonics is the high - fidelity preservation of the human body , and particularly the brain , after what we would call death , in anticipation of possible future revival .
Cryonics is an important transhumanist technology not only because it is already available today , but because the technology is relatively mature  we can reliably stop cells from decaying .
In vitrification , the brain is not frozen in the conventional manner but with a cryoprotectant ( antifreeze ) mixture , which effectively prevents the formation of crystals , causing the water to freeze smoothly , like glass .
Maintenance of a cryo-patient is not difficult  it requires no electricity , but merely the replenishment of liquid nitrogen about every three weeks .
As cryonics becomes more popular , this process could become automated and extremely reliable .
Further improvements in dewar technology will continue to increase safety and reduce costs .
The Cryonics Institute in Michigan , for example , has operated since 1976 without a single mishap .
Financed by the interest of the payout of a life insurance policy ( which for people under 40 may cost as little as $ 100 a year to own ) , patients can be securely cryopreserved for as long as the cryonics company stays afloat and the dewar stays in one piece .
Eventual revival does not require the technology to become available tomorrow , or next year … as long as the liquid nitrogen keeps replenished , you can stay on ice for as long as it takes .
For an existence proof of cryonic revival , there are frogs that can freeze solid and revive later , though reviving a human from freezing would likely require molecular nanotechnology ( MNT ) .
When we will be able to revive a cryo-patient will be strongly related to when we develop sophisticated MNT .
Once we do develop MNT , the prospect of successful revival is extremely likely  it would involve slowly melting the ice and rebooting the metabolism by kickstarting the appropriate chemical reactions within cells .
The above image may look like a photo , but it ’s actually a screenshot from the game Crysis , a first - person shooter which will be released later this year .
Look at screenshots from the game and you ’ll see that computer graphics are already beginning to approach photorealism .
Sometime in the 2020s , reality simulations will become so high - resolution and immersive that they ’ll start to get indistinguishable from the real thing .
Simulations will become the preferred environments for work and play .
Pretty soon the main obstacle to truly immersive VR will not be the visuals but the haptics  our sense of touch .
To fool our senses into believing haptic technologies are conveying the real thing , the “ frame rate ” needs to be significantly higher than for visual technologies , a few hundred updates per second rather than a few dozen  which is why development could take another decade or two .
But many millions of dollars are currently going into efforts to develop advanced VR .
Clearly , World of Warcraft ’s eight million subscribers and Second Life ’s five million subscribers are onto something .
At least 1 % of all broadband Internet users play in virtual worlds , and this number is increasing rapidly .
These worlds typically outclass the real world in terms of customizability , but still have yet to catch up in terms of sensory richness or social fulfillment .
But it ’s only a matter of time .
In the mid -to - late 2020s , I expect full - body , high quality haptic VR suits to be affordable to the average person in developed countries , obtained either from your local Wal - Mart or perhaps printed right out of a desktop nanofactory after payment of a fee .
For more on this , here is one scientific paper , “ Towards full - body haptic feedback ” Gene therapy replaces bad genes with good genes , and RNA interference can selectively knock out gene expression .
Together , they give us an unprecedented ability to manipulate our own genetic code .
By knocking out genes that code for certain metabolic proteins , scientists have been able to make mice that stay slim no matter how much junk food they eat .
Lou Gehrig ’s disease has been cured in mice , and it could only be a few years before we develop a therapy that can cure it for humans too .
Aubrey de Grey ’s SENS ( Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence ) research program contains various prescriptions for the use of gene therapy .
Within a couple decades or so , progress in anti-aging therapies will improve to the point where we are gaining more than an extra year of lifespan per year , reaching so - called “ longevity escape velocity ” eventually culminating in indefinite lifespans
Like many transhumanist technologies , gene therapy is really exciting because it ’s just beginning .
No scientist has yet performed gene therapy on germline cells ( sexual cells in the gonads ) due to the ethical controversy of producing genetic changes which are heritable , but , as with many of these things , it ’s only a matter of time .
Regulations in any given country will only be capable of slowing the overall progress of the field by a few years at most .
The money will go where the research is permitted .
In its mature form , gene therapy and genetic engineering will become extremely cheap and powerful , letting humans live comfortably in a wider range of environments and gain immunity to most , if not all diseases .
Supercomputers of the future , with thousands or millions of times the crunch power of today ’s best , will let us simulate the changes in extreme detail before we attempt them with actual human beings .
This will make ill side effects quite unlikely for the typical case , much to the dismay of the authors of “ genetic engineering turned daddy into a bloodthirsty zombie ! ” trash novels and films .
Space colonies will become necessary to house the many billions of individuals that will be born in the future as our population continues to expand at a lazy exponential .
In his book , , Marshall T. Savage estimates that the Asteroid Belt could hold 7,500 trillion people , if thoroughly reshaped into O’Neill colonies .
At a typical population growth rate for developed countries at 1 % per annum ( doubling every 72 years ) , it would take us 1,440 years to fill that space .
Siphoning light gases off Jupiter and Saturn and fusing them into heavier elements for construction of further colonies seems plausible in the longer term as well .
Why expand into space ?
For many , the answers are blatantly obvious , but the easiest is that the alternatives are limiting the human freedom to reproduce , or mass murder , both of which are morally unacceptable .
Population growth is not inherently antithetical to a love of the environment  in fact , by expanding outwards into the cosmos in all directions , we ’ll be able to seed every star system with every species of plant and animal imaginable .
The genetic diversity of the embryonic home planet will seem tiny by comparison .
Space colonization is closely related to transhumanism through the mutual association of futurist philosophy , but also more directly because the embrace of transhumanism will be necessary to colonize space .
Human beings are n’t designed to live in space .
Our physiological issues with it are manifold , from deteriorating muscle mass to uncontrollable flatulence .
On the surface of Venus , we would melt , on the surface of Mars , we ’d freeze .
The only reasonable solution is to upgrade our bodies .
Not terraform the cosmos , but cosmosform ourselves .
Can you spot the cyborg in this picture ?
You ’re looking right at him !
It ’s Michael Chorost , the man who was born almost deaf but now can hear , thanks to a cochlear implant .
Most of the cyborgs in fiction fit certain stereotypes  bermensch wannabes , cyborg assassins , and supercops .
But cyborgs already walk among us , and they look just like normal people .
This trend will continue in the future .
Many cyborg upgrades which will become available in the 20s and 30s , such as hearing and vision enhancement , metabolic enhancement , artificial bones , muscles , and organs , and even brain - computer interfaces will be invisible to the casual observer , implanted beneath the skin .
Cybernetic features on the surface , such as dermal enhancements or technological actuators like retractable wings , will be carefully camouflaged .
No one will want to shock the rest of society by looking like the tin man in public .
The process of cyborgization has already been happening for centuries if not millennia , since the advent of clothing and piercings .
For many generations , but especially in the last couple decades , our technological gadgets have been getting smaller , more functional , and more closely integrated with our natural activity .
Recently , Microsoft announced Microsoft Surface , a mouseless , keyboardless form of desktop computing which takes input from finger tracing and hand gestures .
The sophistication of biotechnology and the availability of better materials and precision manufacturing will let us make systems so small and effective that even everyday people elect to implant them .
These cybernetic systems will greatly improve our everyday experience , from letting us hear a wider range of ambient sounds , to viewing millions of stars rather than just a few thousand , to making us more resistant to accidents .
They will improve the overall economy by enabling us do more work in less time for better pay .
In the long term , enhanced humans may get a bigger portion of the economic pie than un-augmented humans , but the pie itself will become so much larger than even the poorest humans of tomorrow will be better off than the wealthiest of today .
Here ’s a good cyborg blog I found while doing research for this article , and the Power Jacket , a 4 - pound jacket that enhances strength and is used by people recovering from paralysis .
For more , see the cybernetics category of my del .
ic.ious links , or my top ten list of cybernetic enhancements .
Why do manual labor when the robots can do it for you ?
Self - replication might be considered the Holy Grail of robotics .
A landmark NASA study , “ Advanced Automation for Space Missions ” , found that robotic self - replication is just a matter of engineering , and that no fundamental theoretical breakthroughs are needed .
The study proposed sending a 100 - ton package to the Moon , with a self - replication time of 1 year , and letting it self - replicate until the desired level of development is attained .
The design  which was fleshed out in great detail  was based on electric carts running on rails within the factory , “ paving machines ” that direct sunlight to melt lunar regolith , robotic strip miners for obtaining raw materials , and a solar cell “ canopy ” for powering it all .
After 10 years , over 100,000 tons of lunar factory could be produced autonomously .
The factory ’s functions could then be hijacked for the benefit of human colonists , used to produce housing , products , and provide large quantities of solar power .
If similar self - replicating systems could be constructed on Earth , there would be little limit to the material plenty they could provide .
Self - replicating factories could turn the vast empty badlands of Australia into lush gardens by pumping water from the oceans , self - replicating factories in the high Arctic could melt snow and create gigantic transparent domes suitable for habitation , and submersible automata in the seas could dredge sand from abiotic regions of the ocean floor and process it into gigantic platforms for human colonization .
By opening up such vast new regions of the Earth ’s surface , talk of overpopulation and crowding would fall by the wayside for quite a few decades , with people realizing how much space there actually was all along .
And once things really do get too crowded here on Earth , we can move to the Moon , Mars , and the asteroid belt , using the power of self - replicating robotics to create rotating space colonies suitable for housing trillions of people .
Self - replicating factories could reduce the costs of material goods close to that of food  the primary expenses would consist of raw materials , energy , and whatever small quantity of human oversight is necessary to keep an eye on the overall structure of things .
By utilizing special , man -made “ nutrients ” for top - level functions ( rare or exotic molecules such as custom - synthesized proteins ) and the broadcast architecture  whereby derivative factories must receive affirmations from a central parent factory to continue self - replicating  such factories could be made safe by design .
With such abundance , humanity might actually shift from having a zero-sum perspective on a world to a positive - sum perspective .
With medical tools and basic goods in ample supply , no one in the world would need to suffer from poverty or curable disease .
The nature of human work would shift from manual drudgery and mind - numbing routine to more creative and personally fulfilling endeavors , like art , music , math , science , literature , and exploration .
For more details on the state of the art in self - replicating machines , see the Wikipedia entry , or the magnum opus on the topic , If self - replication is the Holy Grail of robotics , then molecular nanotechnology ( MNT ) is the Holy Grail of manufacturing .
Molecular nanotechnology would use massive arrays of nanometer - scale actuators ( produced initially through self - replication ) to manufacture macroscale products with atomic precision .
This concept is known as the nanofactory
In practical terms , the creation of nanofactories would mean that practically everything could be made out of diamond , motors would become so powerful that a cubic centimeter would provide enough torque to propel a car , medical nanodevices could heal wounds and repair organs without the need for surgery , and air - suspended nanodevices ( “ utility fog ” ) could be configured to simulate practically any desired object on demand .
On the downside of things , it could become easy to manufacture mite - sized robots with a payload of poison sufficient to kill thousands , or a laptop - sized device capable of separating U - 235 from U - 238 in a worrisomely simple and rapid fashion , or self - replicating synthetic algae capable of clogging up our oceans with grey goo .
Enabling widespread use of the positive applications while cleanly and completely suppressing the nasty applications is a first - order challenge .
Incidentally , you can make a difference right now by donating to the Lifeboat Foundation or Center for Responsible Nanotechnology , two of very few organizations focusing on this area .
To some , molecular nanotechnology sounds like science fiction , and based on the grandiose applications I discussed in the previous paragraph , you ca n’t blame them .
But many of the prerequisites of molecular manufacturing have already been demonstrated  “ molecular surgery ” has been used to snip off and replace individual hydrogen atoms , various functional nanoscale devices have been built , scanning tunneling microscopy has been used to mechanically manipulate individual atoms , and so on .
The challenge is to create a nanoscale manipulator arm capable of placing individual atoms with angstrom - level precision , avoiding undesired reactions , and serving as a universal constructor that can build a copy of itself .
There are numerous technical challenges still outstanding , but when these are overcome , manufacturing will be granted the power that nature has had for hundreds of millions of years  the ability to fabricate large objects with molecular precision .
The numerous potential applications of the technology to human enhancement are obvious ; with molecular manufacturing , we could orchestrate elegant improvements to every single body component , achieving all of the upgrades described on my top ten list , and many more .
Most people are familiar with megascale engineering because it is seen throughout fiction  the Death Star , for instance .
Typically , megascale engineering refers to building structures at least 1,000 km in length in one dimension , such as a space elevator Globus Cassus , or Dyson sphere .
With the self - replicating robotics described above , the production of such large structures could be done largely by autonomous drones , with intelligent agents only managing the highest top - level functions and architecture .
Considering that mankind ’s long - term future is in space , and that space right now is pretty devoid of any structure useful or habitable to humans , we have a lot of work to do , and if you can make the projects megascale , why not ?
Like some of the other items on this list , megascale engineering is only indirectly transhumanist  but is still very relevant to the long - term future of intelligent life .
Megascale engineering goes hand - in - hand with the grandiose transhumanist vision : intelligent beings spreading across the cosmos , and eventually shaping the very structure of the universe itself .
The fact that these vast expanses of colonizable space are currently neglected imposes on us a vast opportunity cost  if we hurried up a bit and colonized them , we could give rise to tremendous numbers of people leading worthwhile lives .
What experiences would they have , and what stories would they tell ?
We ’ll never find out , unless we make it happen .
Mind uploading , sometimes referred to as nonbiological intelligence , centers around the controversial proposition that cognitive processing can be implemented on substrates other than our current neurons .
Considering decades of successful results in neurophysiology , and the recent construction of the world ’s first brain prosthesis  an artificial copy of the hippocampus  this seems very likely .
It appears that our minds are defined more by the information pattern they embody than the particular hardware they are implemented on .
Numerous philosophers of mind have long recognized this , but acceptance among the wider public has been a long time in coming : people do n’t want to think that they ’re “ just ” data structures being implemented as computational automata on biological neurons .
But it is hard to think of it any other way : once we dismiss the possibility of an immaterial soul , we must acknowledge the mind as a material pattern implemented in physical configurations , and if other substances aside from our current neurons can meet the requirements for these configurations , then there is no reason why intelligence and consciousness could not exist on another substrate .
For a humorous look at this complex philosophical argument , see “ They ’re Made Out of Meat ” by Terry Bisson .
If our brains really do n’t have to be made out of meat , then we can transfer them to other substrates .
By incrementally replacing each neuron with a synthetic neuron - equivalent , the whole process could go down painlessly and seamlessly .
The transfer could be as slow or as fast as we want : from the information - processing perspective of the brain itself , nothing ever changes .
Light still comes in through the eye ’s lens , hits the retina , is transformed into nerve impulses which travel down the optic nerve , receives further processing in the visual cortex at the back of the brain , the highlights of which are sent to the prefrontal cortex for integration with information from the other senses .
The brain ca n’t tell if it ’s made out of traditional meat , or accelerated biological neurons , or entirely nonbiological neuron - equivalents : the computation is the same .
Sometimes this notion is also referred to as an application of the Church - Turing thesis
If entirely synthetic brains are possible , then there ’s nothing stopping such persons from inhabiting computer networks  not indirectly , sitting in chairs as we currently do , but directly , engaging in computer worlds as a sentient program of tremendous complexity .
With molecular manufacturing on hand , reversing the process would be as simple as printing out a hundred or so kilograms of flesh and bone again , complete with memories from the networked experience .
This is probably among the transhumanist visions that most reliably elicits the “ yuck ! ” reaction , but if functionalism is true , then virtual experience will be indistinguishable from physical experience .
Not only that , but even more enjoyable , due to the manifold degrees of freedom which would become newly accessible .
In a virtual world , there are no laws of physics except those we choose .
For a bit more on simulations , see this primer , and remember : be careful not to generalize from fictional evidence
As argued in the previous section , functionalism seems likely .
If so , then strong AI is possible .
Thinking , feeling , imagining , creating , communicating , thoughtful synthetic intelligences with conscious experiences .
Whether serial computing is sufficient , or parallel computing is necessary , both are within technological reach , and present - day computing speeds are fast approaching the computing power of the human brain .
In fact , according to many estimates , the fastest present - day supercomputer , Blue Gene / P , has already exceeded it .
Blue Gene / P operates continuously at speeds of over a petaflop , which is a million billion operations per second .
For strong AI skeptics , no computer  even one operating at trillions of trillions of trillions of operations per second , is sufficient to implement true intelligence , but to functionalists like myself , such a meat - centric perspective is unjustified .
Distinct from artificial intelligence in general , which has come to refer to any sophisticated software program , artificial general intelligence refers to AIs that display open - ended learning and similar competency levels to human beings .
A handful of researchers are working diligently towards artificial general intelligence , informed by the mathematics of inference and probability theory : Jürgen Schmidhuber , whose “ main scientific ambition has been to build an optimal scientist , then retire ” ; Marcus Hutter , author of the landmark book Universal Artificial Intelligence Ben Goertzel , who recently presented his AI design in a talk to Google ; and Eliezer Yudkowsky , who is developing a reflective decision theory from first principles .
Whether or not others believe in the feasibility of general AI , these individuals will keep working , and one will eventually succeed .
The way the world would be impacted by the arrival of general AI is too extreme to discuss in much detail here .
If raw materials such as sand can be converted into computer chips and then into intelligent minds , eventually the majority of material in the solar system could be made intelligent and conscious .
The result would be a “ noetic Renaissance ” : the expansion of intelligence and experience beyond our wildest dreams .
Conversely , if not given empathic values , artificial intelligence could lead to the doom of all .
It ’s up to us to set the initial conditions appropriately : if not , we might not be around to regret it .
Here 's a visual tour of my comic - making process .
If you are not already a syndicated cartoonist , just copy these steps .
Please excuse the random formatting of this post .
I do n't have time to tweak the HTML .
Click on the photos to enlarge them .
This is me at 4:59 AM , just before my BlackBerry alarm goes off .
5:02 AM , I put on some clothes and head downstairs to eat a banana .
Mmmm ... good banana .
Put the flip - flops on and begin my commute .
Usually it 's dark when I go to work .
And I 'm not smiling so much .
Clearly these photos are staged .
47 seconds later ( I timed it ) , I reach my office .
I wave to the guy delivering newspapers .
At that time of day , it 's just him and me .
Upstairs to the office .
I head to the office fridge for the first of many Diet Cokes .
My office cat , Sarah , hears the refrigerator open from the next room and will be waiting for me in her designated spot .
Sarah demands quality time on the rug or she literally wo n't let me work .
She 'll scream and start ripping my stuff to shreds unless she gets her quota of petting .
This part of my routine has not varied in 17 years .
I take Sarah with me to get additional petting while I check blog comments and e-mails .
She looks uncomfortable but she 's actually totally relaxed .
It 's her favorite petting position .
After I write my blog post , I start the comic - making phase .
In step one , I look at a Word document where I saved a bunch of suggestions from readers .
I peruse the suggestions to see what inspires me .
Once I have a general idea , I use Photoshop to call up a blank comic format , 600 dpi .
I draw directly on the computer screen using a stylus .
The monitor is a Wacom 21UX .
This is the equpment I 've used for the past two years or so .
Before that , it was all on paper .
I draw the first panel ( in rough form ) and type in the words using a font I created of my own handwriting .
When you draw on the computer at a " natural " size , the limit of the technology is that your lines will be jagged .
That 's fine for the rough draft .
( If this were paper , the rough version would be in pencil . )
To finish the art in clean form , I change the rough lines to a light gray , then adjust the viewing size to 200 % and " ink " over the rough art .
I get a smooth line when I work at that size .
In Photoshop lingo , the rough draft is a " layer . "
To turn that layer into a light gray , I adjust its opacity .
The layers are the digital equivalent of tracing paper .
You can see the layer below , but your drawing only touches your current layer .
This is the size I use for the final clean lines .
Any imperfections disappear when the image is shrunk to publishing size .
Sunday strips are a somewhat different process because of the color .
It starts the same , with a black line art version .
Then I copy the file and create a second version with color .
The color version is then stripped of its black .
That leaves me with two files .
One is only black lines , the other is all the colors except black .
Both files go to the printer , who combines them during the printing process .
I assume this kludgy process has something to do with the legacy equipment used by the newspapers .
I just prep the file the way I 'm instructed by United Media .
This is where I sit for most of my work day .
There 's a huge amount of paperwork with this job .
My desk is normally covered with contracts , tax stuff , accounting things , and various projects .
Here 's the view from my chair .
I have the TV on when I do the mindless step of adding the final art .
While working , I usually watch recordings of The Daily Show , tennis , Real Time , or Battlestar Galactica .
I keep my original art table in a corner for historical and sentimental reasons .
I refinished that little table in 1988 .
I 'm not what you would call a " craftsman , " so it 's poorly done .
My original chair , also shown , was created when I was a teenager , using parts from two separate chairs .
Originally it had legs .
I attached it to the base of an old office chair and my mother gave it some upholstery .
It is also poorly constructed .
I love it .
Here are the art supplies I used before moving completely to the computer .
That 's a daily strip , so you can see its size as an original .
About half of all Dilbert strips were drawn with the mechanical pencil shown .
The green thing on the art is what I used to keep the lettering on a straight line .
The pen was for the final art .
If you plan to become a syndicated cartoonist , here is a summary of the equipment you will need :
1. Banana
2. Diet Coke
3. Cat
4. Computer with Wacom 21UX monitor
Good luck .

Experts say alcohol is damaging the health of Australians
One in eight Australians drink at dangerous levels .
The effects on long - term health are likely to be catastrophic .
Australia has always had a boozy reputation but excessive drinking is on the rise .
Doctors are warning of a surge in chronic diseases such as cirrhosis of the liver and cancers as well as brain disorders in the next 20 years .
" Unfortunately Australia has a massive alcohol drinking problem , " said Associate Professor Gordian Fulde from Sydney 's St Vincent 's Hospital .
" It 's our culture , our society accepts it and in some ways society encourages it . "
" Alcohol leaves all the other drugs - heroin , ecstasy , ice ( methamphetamine ) - absolutely for dead , " he told the BBC .
" They 're minute compared to problems caused by alcohol drinking . "
' Out of control '
On average about 10 Australians die every day as a result of alcohol consumption .
It is a health calamity that affects the lives of so many .
The Australian National Council on Drugs has found that 230,000 children have a parent or carer who drinks excessively .
It 's our culture , our society accepts it and in some ways society encourages it
Prof Gordian Fulde
" I think what 's happened here ( is ) it 's a reflection of our prosperity , in the sense that there 's more money that is available for drinking alcohol , " said the council 's chairman Doctor John Herron , who pointed out that the cost of beer , wine and spirits has also gone down .
Research has shown that those families with alcohol problems are also commonly affected by mental illness as well as physical and sexual abuse .
Australia 's indigenous population is suffering more than any other group .
Black Australians are twice as likely to die from the effects of drinking as their non-Aboriginal counterparts .
A recent report showed that alcohol misuse claims the life of an Aborigine every 38 hours .
Suicide is the greatest cause of death among intoxicated men , while many women die of liver cirrhosis or strokes .
Some have managed to conquer their demons , but those dark days of the past are never far from the surface .
" I 'm compulsive , I 'm out of control when I 'm drinking , " said Les Beckett , a middle - aged Aboriginal man from Queensland .
" I 'm a nasty piece of work when I 'm drinking and I 'm a sorry piece of work and dangerous . "
Les admitted to beating his late wife and stealing from his children during his alcoholic years .
Les has remained sober for the past two decades but staying on the straight and narrow is a constant battle .
' Social suicide '
There is a feeling that Aborigines turn to booze and other drugs because they feel left behind by mainstream society more than two centuries after European colonisation .
Alcohol abuse is rife among the Aboriginal community
" To understand alcohol abuse , we need to look at the ways in which our people have been treated over the last 200 years , " explained indigenous Pastor Ray Minniecon .
" Most of this stuff is just a broken spirit of the Aboriginal people ... and alcohol abuse becomes a substitute for the spirit that we 'd like to have . "
Beer and wine have been outlawed in some ' dry ' indigenous communities but for many the cravings remain irresistible .
Despite the gloom - and there is plenty of that - there is hope that things will one day improve .
" There 's a strong capacity in our people to make sure we survive , " said Ray Minniecon .
" We do n't know how we 're going to eradicate it ( the abuse of alcohol ) but we can heal ourselves through our own culture which makes our spirit strong . "
Australians - both black and white - are increasingly hitting the bottle .
Binge drinking has emerged as the real menace .
Those who have to pick up the pieces say the situation is out of control and getting worse .
" The thing that is very scary is that females - especially young females - have now adopted and may be even improving on male drinking habits , " said Gordian Fulde .
" Alcohol is a poison .
It rots your brain .
It is just absolute social suicide , " he said grimly .
“ This is just one of many areas , ” a government brief said , “ where it is inappropriate to compare C.S.R.T. proceedings with background principles that stem from domestic criminal law . ”
Another aspect to the case in the appeals court that has caused public debate involves the government ’s request that the court tighten restrictions on lawyers for the detainees .
One proposal would have limited the number of visits the lawyers could make to Guantánamo , a request that the Justice Department withdrew Friday .
The practice of repeating some of the hearings is shrouded in secrecy .
It first came to public attention in November , when a report by Seton Hall University Law School documented that “ at least three detainees were initially found not to be enemy combatants ” but were then reclassified as enemy combatants after a new hearing .
Reviewing records of 102 hearings that were obtained from the government through lawsuits , the report ’s authors found that “ at least one detainee , after his first and second tribunals unanimously determined him not to be an enemy combatant , had yet a third tribunal ” that then classified him as an enemy combatant .
About 380 men are now detained at Guantánamo .
Military officials have not said in how many cases such hearings were repeated .
A Pentagon spokesman , Lt. Cmdr. Chito Peppler of the Navy , acknowledged that some decisions had reversed earlier findings that detainees were not enemy combatants .
At the same time , Commander Peppler said , after reconsideration in Washington , some detainees benefited from tribunal hearings that were repeated and that reclassified them from enemy combatant to “ no longer enemy combatant , ” making them eligible for release .
Commander Peppler disputed the way the detainees ’ lawyers described the repeat hearings .
He said multiple hearings for a single detainee were part of the process .
Under Defense Department rules , he said , the hearing process is not finished until a Pentagon official “ completes final review and approval of the decisions of the tribunals . ”
“ I AM MAD AS HELL AND I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANY MORE ! ”

If you have not seen this yet , you should .
Every American should see this .
I was so pissed off I felt physically ill while watching it .
Then I felt worse as I watched the public reaction to what I thought was an obvious and disgusting violation of a young citizen ’s right to free speech and to redress his grievances with his government .
At the University of Florida , a 21 - year - old student , Andrew Meyer , was tasered into silence for asking John Kerry controversial questions at a public forum .
Let me get this straight .
It is a public forum , at a public university , specifically for the purpose of letting the public ask questions of an elected public official .
Yes , the kid is acting like a bit of a jerk while he is asking his questions , but being a jerk is not a crime in itself .
If it were , Bill O'Reilly and Glen Beck would have been tased into silence long ago and Ann Coulter would be court - ordered to wear a shock collar around her neck 24/7 … and Barbara Streisand would get to keep the remote .
… But I digress .
You can see at the beginning of the video that everyone is just standing around calmly while John Kerry is speaking .
There is no disturbance or commotion and everyone is focused on John Kerry .
He finishes speaking , looks up , points directly at this kid and says , " You have a question ? ” giving this kid the floor .

You might not think snakes need any more tools in their box of fright tactics .
However , some of these slithering reptiles are dramatic flyers .
Jake Socha of the University of Chicago has been studying snakes ' ability to act like birds for eight years .
Today he revealed just how good they are at winging it .
" Despite their lack of wing - like appendages , flying snakes are skilled aerial locomotors , " he said .
Like a Frisbee
Snakes join birds , insects , bats , squirrels and even ants in the realm of aerial prowess .
So just how do they do it ?
" First of all , they flatten their bodies out all the way from their head to tail , " Socha told LiveScience .
" Snakes are part body and part tail , and they have ribs up until the tail .
They flatten their ribs and make themselves Frisbee - like in form . "
This gets them aerodynamically fit for gliding .
" As [ the snake ] starts falling , it starts sending large S - shaped waves through its body mostly by moving its head from side to side , " Socha explained .
" It also keeps its body parallel to the ground . "
Since they do n't have wings , snakes control their flight patterns by sort of slithering through the air .
By undulating their bodies in an exaggerated S - shaped pattern , they maintain in - flight stability .
It 's sort of like how a tight - rope walker shifts weight from side to side to keep balance .
To get airborne , snakes either hang from a branch , search for a comfy landing spot , and drop , or they actively leap off the branch , which gives them a little more height and allows them to glide farther .
Socha is n't quite sure why snakes developed the ability to glide , but he suggests that they do it to save energy .
" Say you 're in one tree and you want to get to another tree that 's 50 feet away .
You would have to climb down , slither across , and climb up the tree , " he explained .
Turning in mid-air
The paradise tree snake seems to be the only species of flying snake that can turn mid-flight .
Socha has found .
" There are some small clues to how turning works , but I do n't have the details yet , " he said .
" When they are making the turn , it seems that the actual turning only occurs when their head is pointing in the direction they want to turn in . "
Socha also studied Chrysopelea ornata , the golden tree snake .
Both snakes live in the trees in the lowland tropical rainforests in South and Southeast Asia .
Most flying snakes - there are three additional species - grow about 3 to 4 feet long .
They secrete a mild venom , but this is only hazardous to small prey - such as lizards , birds , frogs , and bats - and they are officially classified as harmless to humans .
Socha 's findings will be detailed in the May 15 issue of the Journal of Experimental Biology .
Videos of the snakes in flight are available here .

According to numbers released by the Iraqi government , since July civilian casualties have risen 20 % across Iraq .
The numbers fell significantly in Baghdad .
The figures , provided by Iraqi Interior Ministry officials on Saturday , mirrored the geographic pattern of the troop increase , which is focused on Baghdad .
The national rise in mortality is partly a result of more than 500 deaths , in an August truck bomb attack on a Yazidi community in August north of the capital , outside the areas directly affected by the additional troops .

Various numbers from the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior show no drop in violence .
According to the Iraqi Ministry of Interior , 984 people were killed across Iraq in February , and 1,011 died in violence in August .
No July numbers were released because the ministry said the numbers were n't clear .
But an official in the ministry who spoke anonymously because he was n't authorized to release numbers said those numbers were heavily manipulated .
The official said 1,980 Iraqis had been killed in July and that violent deaths soared in August , to 2,890 .
[ McClatchy , 9/10/07 ]
Petraeus : " Though the improvements have been uneven across Iraq , the overall number of security incidents in Iraq has declined in 8 of the past 12 weeks , with the numbers of incidents in the last two weeks at the lowest levels seen since June 2006 . "
According to General Petraeus
Attacks are only down in only one of the last three weeks , but at the same time we have hit an all time low ?
In the National Intelligence Estimate released three weeks ago said that overall attacks had fallen in 7 out of 9 weeks .
“ The steep escalation of rates of violence has been checked for now , and overall attack levels across Iraq have fallen during seven of the last nine weeks . ” [ National Intelligence Estimate ]
The DIA ’s statistics show that attacks on civilians were at the same level in July that they were in , back in January .
The defense intelligence chart makes the point , with figures from Petraeus ' command in Baghdad , the Multinational Force - Iraq .
Congressional auditors used the same numbers to conclude that Iraqis are as unsafe now as they were six months ago ; the Bush administration and military officials also using those figures say that finding is flawed .
[ AP , 9/9/07 ]
Petraeus :
We endeavor to ensure our analysis of that data is conducted with rigor and consistency , as our ability to achieve a nuanced understanding of the security environment is dependent on collecting and analyzing data in a consistent way over time .
There were significant revisions to the way the Pentagon ’s reports measure sectarian violence between its March 2007 report and its June 2007 report .
The original data for the five months before the surge began ( September 2006 through January 2007 ) indicated approximately 5,500 sectarian killings .
In the revised data in the June 2007 report , those numbers had been adjusted to roughly 7,400 killings – a 35 % increase .
These discrepancies have the impact of making the sectarian violence appear significantly worse during the fall and winter of 2006 before the President ’s “ surge ” began .

What Happens When A Paper Currency Fails ?
The Worst Episode of Hyperinflation in History : Yugoslavia 1993 - 94 Thayer Watkins , Ph.D. Between October 1 , 1993 and January 24 , 1995 prices increased by 5 quadrillion percent .
That ’s a 5 with 15 zeroes after it .
Thayer Watkins is an instructor and graduate advisor in the Economics Department of SAN JOSÉ STATE UNIVERSITY .
Under Tito , Yugoslavia ran a budget deficit that was financed by printing money .
This led to a rate of inflation of 15 to 25 percent per year .
After Tito , the Communist Party pursued progressively more irrational economic policies .
These policies and the breakup of Yugoslavia ( Yugoslavia now consists of only Serbia and Montenegro ) led to heavier reliance upon printing or otherwise creating money to finance the operation of the government and the socialist economy .
This created the hyperinflation .
By the early 1990s the government used up all of its own hard currency reserves and proceded to loot the hard currency savings of private citizens .
It did this by imposing more and more difficult restrictions on private citizens ' access to their hard currency savings in government banks .
The government operated a network of stores at which goods were supposed to be available at artificially low prices .
In practice these store seldom had anything to sell and goods were only available at free markets where the prices were far above the official prices that goods were supposed to sell at in government stores .
All of the government gasoline stations eventually were closed and gasoline was available only from roadside dealers whose operation consisted of a car parked with a plastic can of gasoline sitting on the hood .
The market price was the equivalent of $ 8 per gallon .
Most car owners gave up driving and relied upon public transportation .
But the Belgrade transit authority ( GSP ) did not have the funds necessary for keeping its fleet of 1200 buses operating .
Instead it ran fewer than 500 buses .
These buses were overcrowded and the ticket collectors could not get aboard to collect fares .
Thus GSP could not collect fares even though it was desperately short of funds .
Trip to Truth Delivery trucks , ambulances , fire trucks and garbage trucks were also short of fuel .
The government announced that gasoline would not be sold to farmers for fall harvests and planting .
Despite the government 's desperate printing of money it still did not have the funds to keep the infrastructure in operation .
Pot holes developed in the streets , elevators stopped functioning , and construction projects were closed down .
The unemployment rate exceeded 30 percent .
The government tried to counter the inflation by imposing price controls .
But when inflation continued , the government price controls made the price producers were getting so ridiculous low that they simply stopped producing .
In October of 1993 the bakers stopped making bread and Belgrade was without bread for a week .
The slaughter houses refused to sell meat to the state stores and this meant meat became unvailable for many sectors of the population .
Other stores closed down for inventory rather than sell their goods at the government mandated prices .
When farmers refused to sell to the government at the artificially low prices the government dictated , government irrationally used hard currency to buy food from foreign sources rather than remove the price controls .
The Ministry of Agriculture also risked creating a famine by selling farmers only 30 percent of the fuel they needed for planting and harvesting .
Later the government tried to curb inflation by requiring stores to file paperwork every time they raised a price .
This meant that many store employees had to devote their time to filling out these government forms .
Instead of curbing inflation this policy actually increased inflation because the stores tended to increase prices by larger increments so they would not have file forms for another price increase so soon .
In October of 1993 they created a new currency unit .
One new dinar was worth one million of the " old " dinars .
In effect , the government simply removed six zeroes from the paper money .
This , of course , did not stop the inflation .
In November of 1993 the government postponed turning on the heat in the state apartment buildings in which most of the population lived .
The residents reacted to this by using electrical space heaters which were inefficient and overloaded the electrical system .
The government power company then had to order blackouts to conserve electricity .
In a large psychiatric hospital 87 patients died in November of 1994 .
The hospital had no heat , there was no food or medicine and the patients were wandering around naked .
Between October 1 , 1993 and January 24 , 1995 prices increased by 5 quadrillion percent .
This number is a 5 with 15 zeroes after it .
The social structure began to collapse .
Thieves robbed hospitals and clinics of scarce pharmaceuticals and then sold them in front of the same places they robbed .
The railway workers went on strike and closed down Yugoslavia 's rail system .
The government set the level of pensions .
The pensions were to be paid at the post office but the government did not give the post offices enough funds to pay these pensions .
The pensioners lined up in long lines outside the post office .
When the post office ran out of state funds to pay the pensions the employees would pay the next pensioner in line whatever money they received when someone came in to mail a letter or package .
With inflation being what it was , the value of the pension would decrease drastically if the pensioners went home and came back the next day .
So they waited in line knowing that the value of their pension payment was decreasing with each minute they had to wait .
Many Yugoslavian businesses refused to take the Yugoslavian currency , and the German Deutsche Mark effectively became the currency of Yugoslavia .
But government organizations , government employees and pensioners still got paid in Yugoslavian dinars so there was still an active exchange in dinars .
On November 12 , 1993 the exchange rate was 1 DM = 1 million new dinars .
Thirteen days later the exchange rate was 1 DM = 6.5 million new dinars and by the end of November it was 1 DM = 37 million new dinars .
At the beginning of December the bus workers went on strike because their pay for two weeks was equivalent to only 4 DM when it cost a family of four 230 DM per month to live .
By December 11th the exchange rate was 1 DM = 800 million and on December 15th it was 1 DM = 3.7 billion new dinars .
The average daily rate of inflation was nearly 100 percent .
When farmers selling in the free markets refused to sell food for Yugoslavian dinars the government closed down the free markets .
On December 29 the exchange rate was 1 DM = 950 billion new dinars .
About this time there occurred a tragic incident .
As usual , pensioners were waiting in line .
Someone passed by the line carrying bags of groceries from the free market .
Two pensioners got so upset at their situation and the sight of someone else with groceries that they had heart attacks and died right there .
At the end of December the exchange rate was 1 DM = 3 trillion dinars and on January 4 , 1994 it was 1 DM = 6 trillion dinars .
On January 6th the government declared that the German Deutsche was an official currency of Yugoslavia .
About this time the government announced a NEW " new " Dinar which was equal to 1 billion of the old " new " dinars .
This meant that the exchange rate was 1 DM = 6,000 new new Dinars .
By January 11 the exchange rate had reached a level of 1 DM = 80,000 new new Dinars .
On January 13th the rate was 1 DM = 700,000 new new Dinars and six days later it was 1 DM = 10 million new new Dinars .
The telephone bills for the government operated phone system were collected by the postmen .
People postponed paying these bills as much as possible and inflation reduced their real value to next to nothing .
One postman found that after trying to collect on 780 phone bills he got nothing so the next day he stayed home and paid all of the phone bills himself for the equivalent of a few American pennies .
Here is another illustration of the irrationality of the government 's policies : James Lyon , a journalist , made twenty hours of international telephone calls from Belgrade in December of 1993 .
The bill for these calls was 1000 new new dinars and it arrived on January 11th .
At the exchange rate for January 11th of 1 DM = 150,000 dinars it would have cost less than one German pfennig to pay the bill .
But the bill was not due until January 17th and by that time the exchange rate reached 1 DM = 30 million dinars .
Yet the free market value of those twenty hours of international telephone calls was about $ 5,000 .
So despite being strapped for hard currency , the government gave James Lyon $ 5,000 worth of phone calls essentially for nothing .
It was against the law to refuse to accept personal checks .
Some people wrote personal checks knowing that in the few days it took for the checks to clear , inflation would wipe out as much as 90 percent of the cost of covering those checks .
On January 24 , 1994 the government introduced the " super " Dinar equal to 10 million of the new new Dinars .
The Yugoslav government 's official position was that the hyperinflation occurred " because of the unjustly implemented sanctions against the Serbian people and state . "
Economic collapses and hyperinflation gave rise to Bitcoin .
Many people want a currency that is not controlled by federal banks or governments which led to the birth of cryptocurrency .
Many online sites accept Bitcoin as a form of payment bypassing any country 's currency .

Scientists with the Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Medicine at UCLA were able to produce from human embryonic stem cells a highly pure , large quantity of functioning neurons that will allow them to create models of and study diseases such as Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s , prefrontal dementia and schizophrenia .
Researchers previously had been able to produce neurons - the impulse - conducting cells in the brain and spinal cord - from human embryonic stem cells .
However , the percentage of neurons in the cell culture was not high and the neurons were difficult to isolate from the other cells .
UCLA ’s Yi Sun , an associate professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences , and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator Thomas Südhof at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center were able to produce 70 to 80 percent of neurons in cell culture .
Sun and Südhof also were able to isolate the neurons and determine that they had a functional synaptic network , which the neurons use to communicate .
Because they were functional , the neurons can be used to create a variety of human neurological disease models .
The study results are published today in an early online edition of the peer - reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ Previously , the system to grow and isolate neurons was very messy and it was unknown whether those neurons were functioning , ” Sun said .
“ We ’re excited because we have been able to purify so many more neurons out of the cell culture and they were , surprisingly , healthy enough to form synapses .
These cells will be excellent for doing gene expression studies and biochemical and protein analyses . ”
Sun ’s method prodded human embryonic stem cells to differentiate into neural stem cells , the cells that give rise to neurons .
When the time was right , Sun ’s team added protein growth factors into the cell culture that stopped the neural stem cells from self - renewing and prodded them into differentiating into neurons .
To isolate the cells , Sun and her team added an enzyme that digests a sort of protein matrix that holds cells in culture together .
The neurons could then be separated from the neural stem cells that had not yet differentiated , a sort of chemical round - up that isolated the neurons .
The cells were then put into a cell strainer that allowed passage through of the isolated neurons .
The large number of pure neurons produced will allow Sun and her team to study their biological form and structure , the genes they express , the development of synapses and the electric and chemical communication activities within the synapse network .
“ We will be able to study the cellular properties of neurons in a very defined way that will maybe tell us what goes wrong in diseases such as Alzheimer ’s and Parkinson ’s , ” Sun said .
“ We ’re currently creating many models of human neurological diseases that may provide the answers we ’re looking for .
We do n’t know what causes prefrontal dementia , Huntington ’s disease or schizophrenia .
The key is likely in the quality of neuronal communications .
By studying the chemical and electrical transmissions , we may be able to determine what goes wrong that leads to these debilitating diseases and find a way to stop or treat it . ”
Sun will be among the first researchers to be able to study true neuron function .
A second important discovery in Sun ’s study showed that two embryonic stem cells lines derived in similar manners , and therefore expected to behave similarly when differentiating , did not .
Using the same techniques to prod the two embryonic stem cells lines to differentiate , Sun found that one line had a bias to become neurons that are found in the forebrain .
The other line differentiated into neurons found in rear portions of the brain and spinal cord .
The finding was surprising , and significant , Sun said .
“ The realization that not all human embryonic stem cell lines are born equal is critical , ” Sun said .
“ If you ’re studying a disease found in a certain part of the brain , you should use a human embryonic stem cell line that produces the neurons from that region of the brain to get the most accurate results from your study .
Huntington ’s disease , for example , is a forebrain disease , so the neurons should be differentiated from a cell line that is biased to produce neurons from the forebrain . ”
Sun said there are ways to prod an embryonic stem cell line biased to become neurons found in the rear brain to become neurons found in the forebrain .
However , there are limits to how much prodding can be done .
Sun and her team confirmed that the two embryonic stem cell lines were different through gene expression analysis – neurons that perform different functions in different parts of the brain express different genes .
The cell line prone to becoming neurons found in the forebrain expressed genes typically found those neurons , while the other line expressed genes found in the rear brain and spinal cord .
Sun and her team now are studying why the two human embryonic stem cell lines have biases to become different types of neurons .
“ If we knew that , we might be able to tweak or alter whatever is driving the bias so that limitation in the stem cell line could be bypassed , ” Sun said .

It 's impossible not to be fascinated by the fallout over the hole blown in Northern Rock 's finances by - apparently - its reliance on money which relied on loans which came from derivatives built on bonds issued against sub - prime loans in the US .
( Something like that . )
What 's been overlooked is that so much of this was a software - driven problem in the first place .
Yet unlike most software issues , this stuff worked perfectly well .
It did n't break .
It did exactly what it was meant to all the time .
The problem for the designers of the software , and the people who used it , was that there was one factor they could n't program in : the people who'd be affected by its decisions .
When the software said to take the loans , the bankers did .
There had to be some knowledge that some sub - prime mortgages would never last to maturity - that 's got to be factored in to any risky loan .
But what had n't been foreseen was how people would react on hearing how many of those loans failed .
It produced a feedback loop which might be positive or negative .
And any engineer will tell you there 's a world of difference between systems based on the two .
It 's easy to lose sight of how software - driven today 's money market is .
An interesting post by Paul Kedrosky points out that hedge funds are the new software companies - while what we usually think of as " software " companies are actually marketing arms with a small software house attached .
" Here is a factoid that jumped out at me yesterday , one having to do with the ratio of software developers to non-developers at a major quant fund versus a major software company , " he wrote : " Oracle ( 56,000 empl . ) : 1 - 8 ( one developer for every eight employees ) ; [ hedge fund ] Renaissance Technologies ( 178 empl. ) : 2 - 3 ( two developers for every three employees ) " .
Scary , surely .
Renaissance Technologies says that it has " a long record of producing superior returns for our clients by adhering to mathematical and statistical methods in the design and execution of our investment programs .
We currently have more than 260 employees , and manage over $ 30bn . "
I do n't know whether Kedrosky or the website is correct - I suspect the $ 30bn has shrunk a bit , but it 's still looking for programmers with " Bachelor 's , Master 's , or Ph.D. in Computer Science , Mathematics , or Physics " , experience in C++ in Unix , who 'd like to earn between $ 125,000 and $ 250,000 .
You do have to go and live in Long Island , though .
The problem with these models , however , is that they cannot cope with the wayward patterns of humans .
We fib to people who are selling us the chance to buy a house .
The people selling us the chance to buy the house , meanwhile , fib to us about the interest rate .
( Many sub - prime loans were on an " Adjustable Rate Mortgage , which leapt in cost after a year or two . )
And so worthless loans were created .
Then when the people who are on solid loans , or are creditors - like so many of the Northern Rock customers who queued up - hear about this , and react in a chaotic manner .
It 's that unpredictable element that throws the feedback loop completely out - and no amount of programming will be able to forecast it exactly .
Even if you could find someone smart enough to want to live in Long Island who could also somehow put the " human element " into your financial forecasts , you 'd only be able to get approximations of the truth - rough estimates of how many adjustable - rate mortgages will turn sour , or how people will react to hearing that their mortgage lender is built on uncertain foundations .
Actually , statisticians know a technique for working out what outputs these random inputs can produce : you keep trying the calculation until you see what makes it go mad .
It 's like predicting the weather - probably it wo n't rain , but there might be a thunderstorm .
Given the way that the markets have swung from panic to reassurance and back again , and the way they 've been playing with the money , the name of this technique is apposite : it 's called the Monte Carlo method .
This week I was working on boiler plate authentication in Python , and while talking to Chad , I started getting Rails envy .
I wanted Acts as Authenticated .
When I learned that there are multiple ways to define blocks and that Ruby inherited TIMTOWDI from perl , I developed a philosophical bias against the language .
While Python is n't the perfect language , I am in favor of Guido 's philosophy of restraint in language design .
But still , I want ACTS AS AUTHENTICATED .
So I picked up the Rails book -- trying hard to ignore the redefinition of fundamental boolean operations ( ah hem " unless " ) -- and now I 'm watching DHH's 2006 Rail 's Conf keynote .
Here 's a couple choice quotes :
Decisions are bad .
Because decisions take up your brain power , and it requires brain cycles to consider which or the other .
The more decisions you can take out of the whole the thing , the more brain power you free up to consider the really important things .
That 's of course how this leads to simplicity .
It leads to simplicity in the fact that it is not even something you think about anymore .
Constraints are liberating .
It [ Rails ] takes a stand on lots of issues .
If you design a new schema and you want to use composite primary keys you 're insane .
And basically if you want to indulge in insanity it should hurt .
It should n't be a walk in the park to be insane ...
Hmm this does n't sound like TIMTOWDI at all .
It sounds down right Pythonic , in that there should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it .
Somehow the web development universe got turned upside down .
Ruby got a Pythonic framework , and Python has a TIMTOWDI smorgasbord of frameworks .
What I really , really want is Python On Rails .
In other words , Rails is written in the wrong language .

There is a short follow up here .
Critics of the Iraq war have called it George Bush 's Vietnam .
Now , it appears , President Bush himself agrees .
In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars last week , the president sought to increase support for his policy by drawing parallels between the consequences of the US departure from Indochina in the mid-1970s and possible consequences of a US withdrawal from Iraq .
In Vietnam , the president stated , " the price of America 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like boat people , re-education camps and killing fields " .
Similar suffering would follow from US withdrawal in the midst of continuing conflict in Iraq .
In addition , the president argued , the US itself would lose much of its credibility and suffer a defeat in the global ideological struggle against jihadism .
Bush 's evident purpose in making the speech was to win back the support of conservatives who consider the Vietnam war to have been a noble lost cause but are having growing doubts about the Iraq war .
Even so , the assertions of President Bush deserve to be analysed on their merits .
About one thing the president is undoubtedly correct : Osama bin Laden and other jihadists would be emboldened by a US withdrawal .
Doubtless they would take credit for having humbled the " world 's only remaining superpower " , even if Sunni and Shia insurgents who are not jihadists were primarily responsible for forcing the US out .
The jihadists could point to the US withdrawal from Iraq , following Israel 's withdrawal from Lebanon and the Soviet Union 's withdrawal from Afghanistan , as proof that non-Muslim powers can be defeated by Islamic militants .
One of the lessons of the 20th century is that a revolutionary success in one or a few countries can inspire a transnational revolutionary " wave " because the revolution is seen as unstoppable .
There were waves of international enthusiasm for communism , fascism and , in the 1950s and 1960s , revolutionary secular Arab nationalism .
Perceived US defeat in Iraq could strengthen the contemporary wave of Sunni Muslim radicalism and make it more dangerous .
Indeed , as the president pointed out , Bin Laden himself has cited Vietnam as evidence of America 's weakness .
But the enemy is not the sole audience for displays of military credibility by a great power like the US .
The other audience consists of allies and client states .
Even if a defeat emboldens the enemy , it does not necessarily weaken the confidence of the defeated nation 's allies and client states .
During the cold war , American statesmen were seriously concerned that US defeats in symbolic proxy wars with the Soviet bloc in Korea , Indochina and Afghanistan could lead major allies like West Germany and Japan to doubt the ability of the US to protect them and to appease the other superpower .
But in the case of the jihadist revolution , there is no other superpower .
There is not even a minor power on the other side .
With the fall of the Taliban and Pakistan 's alignment with the US after 9/11 , al - Qaida lost its only state sponsors .
It has no official support from the Sunni regimes it aims to topple , or from what it regards as the Shia heretics in Tehran .
In his speech , Bush said that the US efforts in Asia in the second world war and the cold war , like the campaign against jihadism , " are all ideological struggles " .
While imperial Japan sought to build an empire , not spread a creed , the cold war struggle was indeed both ideological and geopolitical .
But the struggle against jihadists is almost purely ideological .
Here , the greatest difference between Vietnam and Iraq is apparent .
When the US pulled out of Indochina , communists came to power in Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia .
But if the US pulls out of Iraq , jihadists will not come to power there .
Either a Shia majority regime will consolidate a new Iraqi state or de facto partition will result in three regions ruled by Shias , Sunnis and Kurds .
There is a genuine danger that al - Qaida could maintain bases in chaotic parts of Iraq .
But the obvious solution is for the US to provide indirect help to the local authorities in crushing jihadist networks - which may well be some of the Sunni and Shia insurgents whom the US is now fighting .
The goal of stamping out Bin Laden 's allies in Iraq does not require the US to fight both sides in the Sunni - Shia ethnic war on behalf of a fictive national unity government .
There is no doubt the international jihadist movement will be emboldened by US withdrawal .
But the jihadists will be unable to translate their jubilation into effective action if the US works with authorities in a post - American Iraq to suppress jihadists , and collaborates with other nations to heighten their homeland security measures .
The US cut its losses in Indochina , and went on to prevail in the cold war .
In the same way , the US will cut its losses in Iraq - and then will go on with its allies to withstand and outlast the revolutionary jihadist wave .
The defeat of the communist bloc was not a foregone conclusion .
The eventual defeat and decline of jihadism is .

Villagers in south - western China are scratching their heads over the local government 's decision to paint a barren mountainside green , it was reported today .
Workers who began spraying the Laoshou mountain last August told nearby residents they were doing so on the orders of the area authorities , but had not been told why .
Some villagers believed Fumin county officials were attempting to change the area 's feng shui - the ancient Chinese belief of harmonising the physical environment for maximum health and financial benefit .
Others suggested it was an unusual attempt to " green " the area in keeping with calls for more attention to the environment .
The mountain 's exposed rock , covered in an artificial green the colour of Astroturf , looms over houses against a scrubby background .
China 's official Xinhua News Agency estimated the cost of the paint job at 470,000 yuan ( £ 31,247 ) and quoted villagers as saying that , if spent on plants and trees , the money could have restored a far greater area of barren mountain .
Laoshou mountain was quarried for more than two decades , but the quarrying was recently stopped following complaints about dust and noise .
Officials have also been trying to stem environmental damage in the surrounding Yunnan province , where logging and the development of mountain areas have been blamed for heavy floods downriver .
A woman who answered the phone at the Fumin county forestry department said workers there were also unaware of the reasons behind the paint job .
" This is an order from above , " she said .
" You should ask the leader from above .
I do n't have any information on this . "

For Kenneth Foster : No More Death Row

To the state of Texas that sought to extinguish his life , his name is Kenneth Foster ; to many of his friends and supporters , his name is Haramia KiNassor , an eloquent and outspoken activist .

This is a question I ’ve thought about often ( See Google ’s ten rules compared to Microsoft ) .
Before I give my answer , if you ’re in Seattle you should go listen to Lawrence Lessig give his talk on the subject Friday Nov 2nd at Kane Hall , at the University of Washington .
The short answer is No .
In 1998 Microsoft was suffering from the shaky Windows 98 release , was facing a new DOJ lawsuit , and will still engaged in the browser - war with Netscape .
I was in my 4th year at MSFT in ’ 98 , and it was the roughest year for the company I ’d seen .
The browser war was emotionally brutal , and on the Internet Explorer team we were trying to recover from IE4 ( a release few of us were proud of ) .
To outsiders , 1998 was a year of comeuppance for Microsoft .
Looking to next year I do n’t see Google headed for seas quite so rocky .
Yes , there are threats of major lawsuits with YouTube and search privacy , but those threaten future revenue sources more than current ones .
However , like Microsoft in the 90s , the competitive landscape is n’t impressive .
Yahoo and Microsoft have are still trailing players in tech - sector mind share .
Most important comparison :
By 1998 Microsoft , the 23 year old company , had managed to piss off just about everyone at least once : at least it felt that way when I spoke at conferences .
Google , only 8 years old , has a much higher standing in the industry , among competitors and partners , than Microsoft did .
But then again , it ’s 15 years younger :)
On culture and attitude : Life inside Google feels much like at Microsoft in the mid 1990s .
I ’ve been to Google several times ( Chapter 1 of the Myths of Innovation recounts one visit ) and know folks working there .
The vibe feels incredibly familiar to my mid-90s MSFT memories : happy , smart , independent people who feel they are empowered to change the world , and who work in a special place , with special rules .
And as best I can tell , it ’s true .
They deserve to feel that way .
So in that respect , rock - on Googlers .
But the rub is that in the mid-1990s Microsofties felt the same way about their place in the industry , and their ability to change the world , as the folks at Google seem to today :
We have the ball and we are running away with it .
I suspect the folks at Atari in 1977 ( year of the 2600 ) , Apple in 1985 ( and perhaps again now ) , Netscape in 1994 ( year of Mosaic ) and dozens of other companies that were once at the top of the world .
And they were all prone to the same kinds of self - destructive hubris .
Common mistakes employees of dominant companies make :
Believing no one has been at the center of the tech - universe before .
Inability to take a non self - centric view of the world .
Depending on power and intimidation , more than intelligence and wisdom .
Failing to find ways to stay humble & hungry while being dominant .
Focusing more on beating rivals than satisfying customers .
Underestimating how decisions will be received by the rest of the world .
When I was at Microsoft ( ’94 - ’03 ) , I always felt the company made things so much harder for itself in how employees , executives included , presented themselves to the world .
I ca n’t tell you how many times I saw Microsoft employees embarrassing themselves at conferences , e-mail lists or on newsgroups .
And it was n’t entirely their fault : they were expressing the internal culture to the outside world and the result was predictably disastrous .
The perception of Google today , and in 2008 , is at a tipping point .
They are quickly rounding out their positions of dominance and the Microsoft comparisons will only get sharper .
If they can learn the best lessons from Microsoft ’s 1998 , it ’s about handling pressure with grace , and the wisdom to pay more than token attention to the mistakes above .
A group of US record labels agreed to drop a music piracy case in the US after the alleged file - sharer argued that it could not be proved that she downloaded any illegal music .
The case may set a precedent that undermines scores of other music piracy cases .
Tammie Marson of Palm Desert , California refused to pay the initial $ 3,500 demanded by a group of record labels and opted to fight the case in court .
Marson and her lawyer Seyamack Kouretchian of Coast Law Group argued that the fact that Marson 's computer contained illegal music files downloaded over her internet connection was not proof that she had committed a crime .
The record companies – Virgin , Sony BMG , Arista , Universal and Warner Brothers – agreed to dismiss the case and pay their own legal costs .
" They do n't take these cases to trial , they either settle or dismiss , " Kouretchian told OUT - LAW .
" It was our position that they could not ever prove that Tammie Marson downloaded this music or that Tammie Marson made it available .
It was just an absolute impossibility .
The best they could ever prove was somebody had used Tammie Marson 's internet account to download the music or make it available .
That 's the best they could ever do . "
Marson argued that as a cheerleader teacher she had had hundreds of girls through her house , any one of whom could have used her computer .
She also used a wireless internet network , meaning that people outside of her house could have used her internet connection .
" She does n't even know what a shared folder is , " said Kouretchian .
If this becomes a popular defence it could seriously hamper a huge number of file - sharing lawsuits taken in the US against individuals .
It also looks to be a trend in defence against movie file - sharing law suits .
Software executive Shawn Hogan is using a similar argument in his response to a film industry case against him .
He has decided to fight the case rather than pay the $ 2,500 demanded of him , even though it will cost him far more than that .
His case is that he did not commit an offence and that the film industry cannot prove that he did .
" They 're completely abusing the system .
I would spend well into the millions on this [ lawsuit ] , " he told Wired magazine .
Kouretchian said that Marson chose to take a similarly principled stand .
" Copyright is my area of expertise , we were n't going to fold .
They tested the waters with us to see if my client was prepared to go the distance , " he said .
" We were n't going to be fooled by the allegations and the threats . "

Summing Up
How can business schools reprofessionalize management ?
The responses to this month 's column can be characterized in several ways :
1 ) Business schools , particularly those regarded as being the " elite , " by their very nature have contributed to the problem of deprofessionalizing management by building more value in their alumni networks than in their curricula and teaching .
2 ) Business school curricula , if not always their teaching , reflect the demands of the market .
This is or is not appropriate , but not unexpected .
3 ) How can business schools deprofessionalize something that is not a profession ?
Phil Clark 's comment characterizes the first line of thought .
As he put it , an " elite B - school degree is seen as a ticket to connections to ' take care of ( oneself ) , ' not necessarily to provide value to any organization or build new organizations . "
The market - driven explanation was offered most provocatively by Tony Wanless , who commented that " B - schools are university cash cows , and the only way to justify their fees is to go where the mass market wants it to go .
So they concentrate on what will earn their graduates the largest immediate salaries . "
As Edward Hare put it , " ' Business schools ' are a business … .
I 'd be reluctant to blame the business schools .
They … give students tools .
But they rarely can teach motives , ethics , and ideals . "
The phenomenon is not confined to the United States .
B.V. Krishnamurthy described the concerns of a hundred e-mail inquiries from prospective students at his business school .
All but two inquired primarily about the earnings of previous graduates .
Eric Mueller comments that management will not be a profession until it requires " formal qualification , " is governed by a " regulatory body , " and establishes an " objective means to assess competence . "
As a result , business schools provide the business world , in his view , with no more than an " effective , albeit expensive , recruiting service . "
In citing 7 requirements of a profession , of which management meets only 1 or 2 , Roger Manley commented that " the thought that management is being ' deprofessionalized ' strikes me as a bit of a stretch . "
Patrick O'Rourke added , " Let 's forget about striving to gain acceptance as a profession in the traditional sense , as we are not comparing like with like .
The French term of ' cadre ' may best accommodate the reality of business practitioners in a modern world . "
Respondents also provided some possible remedies .
Osbert Lancaster suggested that what is needed is an injection of " ' craftsmanship ' — broadly conceived as doing something well for its own sake , " into the thinking of managers and those who train them .
Gerald Nanninga comments , " Maybe what we need are fewer professors and more mentors . "
Karen Dempster suggests that students and faculty with more practical experience , as well as accreditors willing to recognize programs that " tailor learning for students " rather than just meet rigid standards , would help .
Can business schools do much about what may be largely market - driven phenomena in a field that has never qualified as a profession ?
Or are there ways in which business schools can reprofessionalize management ?
While looking over responses to this month 's column , I noticed a newspaper article describing a growing number of young managers who are making so much money managing , in many cases other people 's money , that they have decided to forego an MBA .
Does this suggest that , by freeing up classroom spaces for those interested in managing people , that the market may help redress problems described above ?
What do you think ?
Original Article
My areas of interest bring me into contact with companies that are , in the words of the book of the same name , " built to last . "
But I 'm puzzled .
If they represent the crème - de - la - crème of long - term management performance , why is it that only a handful of graduates from Harvard Business School — or for that matter Stanford , Wharton , Chicago , INSEAD , or other well - known business schools — have ever been employed by them ?
A book being published in September , From Higher Aims to Hired Hands , by one of my colleagues , Rakesh Khurana , may help explain it .
Khurana traces the development of business schools from their early days in a small number of " elite " institutions ( his word ) where the ideal or goal was that of creating a field of management that would qualify as a " profession , " combining " mastery of specific knowledge with adherence to certain formal or informal codes of conduct and , even more fundamental , to an ideal of service . "
Graduates often sought long - term employment as managers in a wide range of large , established , highly - regarded business firms .
Khurana then proceeds to outline significant events that led to the dilution and destruction of this ideal , to the replacement of " managerial capitalism " by " shareholder capitalism . "
At the risk of simplification , among these were the results of two foundation - sponsored studies of management education in the 1950's that argued for greater emphasis on the development of measures and exploration of theories by means of quantitative analyses of various phenomena encountered by managers .
This , it was thought , would legitimize a field largely based to that point on practice and shared ( often untested ) wisdom handed down from one generation to the next .
This was followed by , among other things , the growing acceptance of a 1970 declaration by Milton Friedman that " the sole concern of American business should be the maximization of profit " and the development of the field of " agency theory " by " Chicago School " alumni which clearly positioned the manager as the agent of the shareholder .
They advocated larger performance - based incentives that were necessary to " align " the interests of managers and shareholders .
Takeovers were favored as a means of enforcing the urgency of such alignment .
At about this time , according to Khurana , deregulation came along that both made it possible and more tempting for agents to act in ways that served the short - term interests of both parties while abandoning any semblance of " professionalism . "
As readers , we are left to speculate how , if at all , this might have led to such phenomena as Enron , the management revolving door , and even today 's subprime mortgage mess .
Are these the results of an era of " shareholder capitalism " ?
The effect on the elite business school was , in Khurana 's view , substantial .
The forces described above have led to the hiring of faculty well - trained in economics and math , ready to do battle with issues and phenomena lending themselves to quantification ( e.g. , finance and agency theory ) , but " not intrinsically interested in business . "
It may account for evidence that students today are primarily interested in admission to , rather than study at , the elite business schools to enable them to join the best networks in order to make the most money the fastest .
If so , does it help explain why they often do n't go to work for organizations seeking managers of other people ?
In an effort to adapt , Khurana observes that nearly every one of the elite schools has adopted missions in which the development of leaders is paramount .
But one might ask whether this is of much interest to students attending such programs or to the firms hiring their graduates .
This raises other interesting questions .
To what extent is today 's business school contributing to the deprofessionalization of management ?
Should it foster greater balance between managerial and shareholder capitalism ?
By what means ?
What do you think ?

NASA Astronomers Find Bizarre Planet - Mass Object Orbiting Neutron Star
Image right :
In this artist depiction of the SWIFT J1756.9-2508 system , the foreground object is the planet - mass object .
The pulsar , located at the upper right , is tidally distorting the companion into a teardrop - shaped object , and ripping gas from it .
This material flows in a stream toward the pulsar and forms a disk around it .
Eventually , enough gas builds up in the disk to produce an outburst bright enough to make the system visible from Earth .

The low - mass companion in SWIFT J1756.9-2508 may have a mass just a few times greater than Jupiter , but up close , it would probably look nothing like a planet .
The object is probably dominated by helium gas .
Even though it is much larger than the pulsar , the pulsar is at least 100 times more massive .

Using NASA ’s Swift and Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer ( RXTE ) satellites , astronomers have discovered one of the most bizarre planet - mass objects ever found .
The object ’s minimum mass is only about 7 times the mass of Jupiter .
But instead of orbiting a normal star , this low - mass body orbits a rapidly spinning pulsar .
It orbits the pulsar every 54.7 minutes at an average distance of only about 230,000 miles ( slightly less than the Earth - Moon distance ) .
" This object is merely the skeleton of a star , " says co-discoverer Craig Markwardt of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " The pulsar has eaten away the star ’s outer envelope , and all the remains is its helium - rich core .
" Hans Krimm of NASA Goddard discovered the system on June 7 , when Swift ’s Burst Alert Telescope picked up an outburst of X rays and gamma rays in the direction of the galactic center .
The source was named SWIFT J1756.9-2508 for its sky coordinates in the constellation Sagittarius .
RXTE began observing SWIFT J1756.9 on June 13 with its Proportional Counter Array ( PCA ) .
After analyzing the PCA data , Markwardt realized that the object was pulsing in X rays 182.07 times per second , which told him that it was a rapidly spinning pulsar .
These so - called millisecond pulsars are neutron stars that spin hundreds of times per second , faster than a kitchen blender .
Normally , the spin rate of neutron stars slows down as they age , but much like we can pull a string to “ spin up ” a top , gas spiraling onto a neutron star from its companion can maintain or even increase its fast spin .
In the case of SWIFT J1756.9-2508 , Markwardt detected subtle modulations in the X - ray timing data that revealed a low - mass companion tugging the pulsar toward and away from Earth .
His calculations show that the companion has a minimum mass about 7 times that of Jupiter .
Because we do n’t know the orbital inclination of the system , the companion ’s actual mass is unknown , but it is extremely unlikely to exceed 30 Jupiters .
MIT astronomers led by Deepto Chakrabarty also observed the system with RXTE , before it faded to invisibility on June 21 .
Chakrabarty ’s group reached identical conclusions , and the two teams have coauthored a paper that has been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
The system is only the eighth millisecond pulsar that is observed to be accreting mass from a companion .
Only one other such system has a pulsar companion with such a low mass .
The companion in this system , XTE J1807 - 294 , also has a minimum mass of about 7 Jupiters .
" Given that we do n’t know the exact mass of either companion , ours could be the smallest , " says Krimm .
The system probably formed several billion years ago , when it consisted of a very massive star and a smaller star with perhaps 1 to 3 solar masses .
The more massive star evolved quickly and exploded as a supernova , leaving behind the neutron star .
The smaller star eventually started to puff up en route to becoming a red giant , and the two objects became embedded in the extended stellar envelope .
This drained orbital energy , causing the two stars to draw ever nearer , while simultaneously ejecting the envelope .
Today , the two objects are so close to each other than the neutron star ’s powerful gravity produces a tidal bulge on its companion , siphoning off gas that flows into a disk that surrounds the neutron star .
The flow eventually becomes unstable and dumps large quantities of gas onto the neutron star , causing an outburst like the one observed in June .
Evolution models by Christopher Deloye of Northwestern University suggest that the low - mass companion is helium dominated .
" Despite its extremely low mass , the companion is n’t considered a planet because of its formation , " says Deloye .
" It ’s essentially a white dwarf that has been whittled down to a planetary mass .
" After billions of years , little remains of the companion star , and it remains unclear whether it will survive .
" It ’s been taking a beating , but that ’s part of nature , " adds Krimm .
With an estimated distance of roughly 25,000 light - years , the system is normally too faint to be detected at any wavelength , and is only visible during an outburst .
SWIFT J1756.9 has never been seen to erupt until this June , so as Markwardt points out , " We do n't know how long it will slumber before it wakes up again . "
There are fears that ISPs could become the web 's gatekeepers
The agency said it was opposed to " network neutrality " , the idea that all data on the net is treated equally .
The comments put the agency at odds with companies such as Microsoft and Google , who have called for legislation to guarantee equal access to the net .
The agency submitted its comments to the Federal Communications Commission , which is investigating net access .
Several US internet service providers ( ISPs ) , including AT&T and Verizon , have previously said that they want to charge some users more money for certain content .
This has particularly become an issue with the rise of TV and film download services .
A similar debate is ongoing in the UK .
One web
The Justice Department said imposing net neutrality regulations could hinder development of the internet and prevent ISPs from upgrading networks .
The agency said it could also shift the " entire burden of implementing costly network expansions and improvements onto consumers " .
" Regulators should be careful not to impose regulations that could limit consumer choice and investment in broadband facilities , " said Thomas Barnett , the department 's antitrust chief .
The agency 's stance is contrary to much of the internet community that believes in an open model for the internet .
Net neutrality advocates argue that a two - tier internet would allow broadband providers to become gatekeepers to the web 's content .
Providers that can pay will be able to get a commercial advantage over those that cannot , they say .
In particular , there is a fear that institutions like universities and charities would suffer .
Last year , Sir Tim Berners - Lee the inventor of the web rallied against the idea of a two - tier internet .
" What 's very important from my point of view is that there is one web , " he said .
" Anyone that tries to chop it into two will find that their piece looks very boring . "
Unparticles , but not particles , can fit in a theory that has the property of continuous scale - invariance , which is difficult to visualize .
A fractal , like this Koch Curve , is an example of discrete scale - invariance because it looks the same if multiplied by a fixed number .

Howard Georgi , a physicist at Harvard University , has recently published a paper on so - called unparticle physics , which suggests the existence of “ unparticle stuff ” that cannot be accounted for by the standard model .
Appearing in a recent edition of Physical Review Letters , the paper says that unparticle stuff would be very different than anything seen before .
Georgi , a highly regarded physicist well - known for his pioneering work in areas including supersymmetry , quantum chromodynamics , and grand unified theories , explains that the low - energy physics of nontrivial scale - invariance cannot be described in terms of particles .
In this initial investigation of the idea , he gives a quantitative scenario of the production of unparticle stuff , and predicts how it could be experimentally detected in the upcoming Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , the most powerful particle accelerator that will open in early 2008 .
In scale - invariant theory — where objects do n’t change when their dimensional qualities are multiplied by a rescaling parameter — the concept of particles does n’t work because most particles have a definite nonzero mass .
In quantum mechanics , this is n’t a problem because the standard model does not have scale - invariance .
But Georgi suggests that there could be an undiscovered sector of the standard model that is exactly scale - invariant .
“ I have been having a lot of fun with this , ” Georgi told PhysOrg.com .
“ It is a phenomenon that has been understood mathematically for a long time , in the sense that we know of theories that have the peculiar property of scale - invariance .
It is hard to describe this because it is so different from what we are used to .
For us it makes a big difference whether we measure masses in grams or kilograms .
But in a scale - invariant world , it makes no difference at all . ”
Georgi explains that photons , which are particles of light , have the property of scale invariance because they have zero mass .
Multiplying all the photon energies by a factor of 1000 would make them look exactly the same .
“ Clever theorists ( like Ken Wilson ) showed long ago that there were crazier possibilities which do not involve particles with zero mass , but still have the property that energies can be multiplied by any factor to give a physically equivalent theory , ” Georgi said .
“ [ But ] this is impossible if there are particles with any definite nonzero mass .
That is why I called this ‘ unparticle ’ stuff . ”
This scale - invariant sector would interact very weakly with the rest of the standard model , making it possible to observe evidence for unparticle stuff , if it exists .
The unparticle theory is a high - energy theory that contains both standard model fields and “ Banks - Zaks ” fields ( which has scale - invariance at an infrared point ) .
The two fields can interact through the interactions of ordinary particles under high enough machine energy or a low enough mass scale .
“ If all of the stuff that is scale - invariant couples to all the stuff that is n't in a way that gets weaker and weaker as the energy gets lower , then it could be that , at the energies we can probe today , we just do n't see the unparticle stuff at all , ” Georgi explained .
“ There could be a scale - invariant world separate from our own that is hidden from us at low energies because its interactions with us are so weak . ”
These particle interactions would appear to have missing energy and momentum distributions .
Georgi has calculated the peculiar distributions of missing energy for the decay of a top quark , which would signify the production of unparticle stuff .
“ The very confusing question of ‘ What does unparticle suff look like ? ’ gets replaced by a simpler question :
‘ How does unparticle stuff begin to show up as the energy of our experiments is increased ? ’ ” he said .
He explained that a good way of understanding unparticle stuff is with neutrinos .
Neutrinos have some properties in common with unparticle stuff .
For example , neutrinos are nearly massless and therefore nearly scale invariant .
They couple very weakly to ordinary matter at low energies , and the effect of the coupling increases as the energy increases .
“ Very often , in a scattering experiment , we can infer the existence of neutrinos by adding up the energy and momentum of the colliding particles and subtracting the energy and momentum of all the particles we can see to get the energy and momentum of the ‘ missing ’ ( which just means that we do n’t see them because they escape our detectors without interacting ) neutrinos , ” he said .
“ By doing the scattering many times , we can measure a probability distribution for the missing energy and momentum .
And by looking at the distribution , we can tell whether there is one or two or more neutrinos missing in the particular process we are studying .
“ An interesting result of my analysis is that such a distribution for a process that produces unparticles looks like the distribution for a fractional number of massless particles , ” he added .
“ This is weird , but it follows very simply from the scale invariance of the unparticles .
It is the first glimmer of an answer to the question of how unparticles begin to show up . ”
Because the signatures of unparticle stuff would be very distinct , LHC experiments have the potential to verify the existence of unparticle stuff immediately .
Georgi says that , in his opinion , unparticle stuff would be a more striking discovery than supersymmetry or extra dimensions , both of which point to just more new particles .
Unparticle stuff , on the other hand , would be a different concept altogether .
“ I , and a number of other researchers , am now trying to push these ideas harder , ” Georgi said .
“ Other weird properties of unparticles have already emerged .
I expect more .
It is great fun .
Of course , it would be even greater fun if we actually saw stuff like this at the LHC .
But even if we do n’t , I believe that analyses like this are useful because they can shake us out of preconceptions that could cause us to miss important physics as the energy of our machines grows . ”

Senator Jim Webb ( via email ) :
Today , Senator Chuck Hagel and I will reintroduce an amendment that seeks to provide our men and women in uniform with the responsible rotational cycles they deserve .
We will be offering an amendment that requires our troops have a 1:1 deployment - to - dwell ratio for active units and members .
This is a minimum floor .
The Department of Defense 's historic policy and current goal is a ratio of 1:2 .
Currently , Army units are deployed for 15 months with 12 months at home .
It is not unusual for Marines also to have less time at home than the length of their last deployment .
This amendment is vital to the continued morale and effectiveness of our Armed Forces , which are breaking under the strain of unprecedented long deployments in combat zones .
Please email your Senators before today 's vote .
Encourage them to support my Dwell Time Amendment to support our troops .
This Dwell Time Amendment provides a safety net under our troops .
However long a servicemember has been deployed , they deserve at least that much time at home .
It is a very simple , common sense amendment .
In July , my amendment received 56 votes .
We need just 4 more votes this time to pass this amendment , and I am asking for your help .
Please take a moment now , and send a message to your Senators to support the Dwell Time Amendment .
After 4 1/2 years of occupation in Iraq , it is time for the availability of troops to dictate the operational tempo , not the other way around .
I hope you will join me in supporting this important
legislation .
Then help me spread the word to friends and family across the country .
For the sake of our servicemembers and their families , this is the right thing to do .
Sincerely ,
Jim Webb

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain ’s first official road signs to warn drivers about the dangers of trusting their satellite navigation devices ( satnavs ) were introduced on Tuesday in a Welsh village .

The signs , introduced by authorities in rural St Hilary , in the Vale of Glamorgan , South Wales , to warn drivers about placing too much faith in the directional gadgets , could be brought in across the country if the trial is successful .
Problems were reported after foreign drivers found it difficult to understand phrases such as “ unsuitable for heavy goods vehicles ” but could understand pictorial notices , media reported .
The four signs have been introduced around one particular black spot in the village , where the electronic devices direct truck drivers to a shortcut between the main M4 motorway and Cardiff airport .
The road is far too narrow for many to travel down , causing them to get stuck and sparking major traffic problems .
More than a dozen large lorries had become stuck in the road in the past six months , according to traffic engineer Mark Simpson who came up with the idea for the signs .
“ We have had a series of problems with drivers getting into trouble by trusting their satnavs and we needed to do something about it , ” Simpson was quoted in newspapers as saying .
“ They can send drivers on the most direct routes which turn out to be narrow roads completely unsuitable for heavy and long trucks and lorries .
Satnav can be a wonderful tool for drivers but it does have its dangers . ”
If successful , officials plan a national roll - out of the signs to combat what is seen as a growing problem for frustrated motorists , with recent figures showing that more than four million of Britain ’s 32 million drivers rely on satnavs .
Some have reported that software glitches have sent drivers down one - way streets or up impassable mountain tracks .
One ambulance driver with a faulty satnav drove hundreds of miles in the wrong direction while transferring a patient from one hospital in Ilford east of London to another just 8 miles
away .
A spokesman for the Welsh Assembly regional government said that officials would be “ watching closely ” the trial ’s results before deciding whether to expand the program .
He also said that officials from Britain ’s Department of Transport had been consulted and were also monitoring the experiment .
Should the world ’s most - used search engine be more of a Yankee Google Dandy ?
Google Inc. occasionally features light - hearted doodles on its colorful home - page logo to commemorate special occasions .
But now they are drawing criticism from conservatives for not being more patriotic .
The Mountain View , Calif. , company bathes its logo in stars and stripes every Independence Day , but last week ’s decision to honor the 50th anniversary of the Sputnik launch -- the second “ g ” in Google was replaced with a drawing of the Soviet satellite -- is being blasted by some conservatives .
Not only did Google honor an achievement by a totalitarian regime that was our Cold War enemy , they griped , but it did so without having ever altered its logo to commemorate U.S. military personnel on Memorial Day or Veterans Day .
“ It ’s a kick to your belly , ” said conservative blogger Giovanni Gallucci , 39 , a social media consultant from Dallas .
“ I understand these guys are scientists and engineers and they have their quirks and want to make sure people are recognized who might not normally be recognized . . . but why not celebrate the struggles that we ’ve come through as a people ? ”
Conservatives see the Sputnik logo as particularly galling because the search giant ’s in - house artist has tweaked the Google logo for a variety of obscure events , including World Water Day , Persian New Year , painter Edvard Munch ’s birthday and China ’s Dragon Boat Festival .
Google regularly gives other U.S. holidays the logo treatment , including Halloween , Thanksgiving and St. Patrick ’s Day ( but not for Columbus Day , which was Monday ) .
“ When they ignore Veterans Day and Memorial Day , I think they ’re telling us something about the way they view America , ” said Joseph Farah , editor of WorldNetDaily.com , a conservative website that has criticized Google ’s logo decisions .
Conservatives have found plenty of reasons to complain about Google , which they see as a liberal enclave because of the corporate causes it champions and the political candidates its employees support .
The company , started in 1998 by two Stanford University graduate students , prides itself on progressive thinking .
Google set up a $ 90 - million foundation in 2005 to fund causes widely seen as liberal , including climate change and global public health .
What ’s more , the company ’s employees contribute overwhelmingly to Democratic candidates .
While the company ’s new political action committee has given nearly half of its $ 22,100 in contributions this year to Republicans , 93 % of the $ 141,000 donated by individual employees went to Democrats , according to Federal Election Commission data provided by CQ Moneyline .
Google ’s decision to self - censor its search engine in China to comply with the Communist government ’s online rules also has drawn condemnation from Republicans .
The company defended its decision to let Veterans Day and Memorial Day pass without a special logo , saying it was trying to be respectful .
“ Google ’s special logos tend to be lighthearted and often scientific in nature , ” spokeswoman Sunny Gettinger said in an e-mailed statement .
“ We do not believe we can convey the appropriate somber tone through this medium to mark holidays like Memorial Day . ”
Google has altered its logo more than 140 times since 1999 , according to a gallery on the company ’s website .
The choices sometimes reflect Google ’s corporate fascinations .
For example , the company is so enthralled with space exploration that it recently agreed to sponsor a $ 30 - million contest to land unmanned rovers on the moon .
That passion has been reflected in logos that commemorate some of America ’s crowning achievements in space exploration , including lunar landings and Mars missions , and the birthday of noted American astronomer Percival Lowell .
Still , outrage increases in some corners of the Web for each year Google fails to honor Memorial Day .
In May , the website www.zombietime.com started a Memorial Day logo contest to “ show Google that it ’s not so hard ” to make respectful ones .
It has received about 250 entries , including ones that replace the second “ o ” with a Purple Heart medal and the “ l ” with the flagpole in the Iwo Jima flag - raising .
“ I have no problem with Google commemorating obscure holidays or some of the trivial anniversaries that they note , ” the site ’s owner , who declined to give his name , said via e-mail , “ just so long as they also make special logos for the more significant holidays . ”

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - A study in Australia has shown that changes occur in blood vessels in the eyes of heavier and obese children from as young as six , warning signs that might be linked to cardiovascular disease in later life .
Previously , these changes -- widening of veins and narrowing of arteries -- were only observed in the retinas of heavy teenagers and adults , and this is the first time that such troubling signs have been seen in children so young .
Writing in the International Journal of Obesity , the researchers called for extensive monitoring of these subtle blood vessel changes as they can be an early indication of risks such as hypertension and stroke when the children enter adulthood .
“ It was initially thought that the risk profile developed in adolescents and young adults , but ( this study ) suggests that these changes probably occur even at an early age , ” Paul Mitchell , a professor at the University of Sydney ’s Centre for Vision Research , said in a telephone interview .
“ It may be worthwhile examining children or adolescents for subtle retinal vessel size as these could be markers of a person ’s risks as they get older into adulthood . ”
The retina is a thin layer of neural cells that lines the back of the eyeball .
The study involved 1,740 six - year - olds from 34 schools in Sydney .
After accounting for differences such as sex , ethnicity , length of the eyeball , birth weight and mean blood pressure , the researchers found unique changes in minute blood vessels in the retinas of children who were over the mean weight .
The average diameter of their retinal veins was 2.1 microns larger than those of their lighter peers .
However , the average diameter of retinal arteries in the heavy children was 2.2 microns narrower than other children .
Veins carry low - oxygen blood back to the heart , while arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart .
“ The reason for widening of the veins may simply relate to a larger blood volume associated with a heavier child .
It ’s harder to explain the effects on the retinal ( arteries ) .
It could be a reflex response in obese children , but that remains to be seen , ” Mitchell added .
It also remained to be seen if the changes to blood vessels were reversible .
“ In adult populations , we have n’t ( seen ) reversibility so often .
For the narrowing of arteries associated with elevated blood pressure , even when blood pressure is back to normal , the arteries do n’t seem to respond , but we do n’t know about the ( retinal blood vessels ) , ” Mitchell said .

After the first three debates on National television , three mainstream news channels featured polls asking the American people who won .
After the first debate on May 3rd , MSNBC ran a poll obtaining over 72,000 responses showing Ron Paul was the most convincing candidate receiving 45 % of the vote .
His nearest competitor was Mitt Romney who received 18 % .
Fox news ran its own poll after the second debates on May 15 , and with over 40,000 votes Ron Paul came in second with 25 % of the vote .
Watching Sean Hannity ’s face was priceless as while he was saying that Ron Paul ’s chances were over in this election , Fox ’s polling numbers flashed across the screen and had Ron Paul in the lead .
He immediately did his best spin to claim the polls had been rigged .
MSNBC also ran a poll about that debate and discovered Ron Paul was , again , the most convincing candidate with 64 % of the over 25,000 responses .
After the third debate on June 5 , CNN ’s poll of over 25,000 respondents showed Ron Paul won with 60 % of the vote .
One would think with such a strong showing on the online polls for a “ second tier ” candidate that the mainstream media ( MSM ) would have discussed this phenomenon at length and on the front page .
However , no such stories appeared .
In fact , MSM pundits did their best to ignore these figures and instead focused mainly on who they deemed to be the top three choices ; effectively , taking control of the election and deciding quite undemocratically who was a “ real ” candidate .
Even though the MSM is largely ignoring him , Ron Paul is taking the Internet by storm .
His name leads in searched terms ahead of even Paris Hilton , his YouTube videos have been viewed over one million times and he has more Meetup groups than all other GOP candidates combined .
Poll after poll conducted on the Internet shows Ron Paul winning or at least in the top three .
Yet , these polls are completely discounted and Ron Paul ’s tremendous Internet support is sloughed off by the MSM .
Occasionally , the MSM will grant some notice of the huge grassroots support online but then discount it by saying “ he may be doing well online but he is only polling at 1 or 2 percent . ”
Does n’t anyone see a disconnect between those two clauses ?
Who do they think is on the Internet ?
Pet mice running around in tubes ?
The Internet , for those who seem confused , is a link of people who write things and have ideas and OPINIONS .
The 300 - plus Meetup groups he has across the country are also attended by people .
The MSM is trying to get us to believe that Ron Paul is only polling at 1 % because that is what was said on a few polls and the fact that he is polling much higher on the Internet does not count .
It is as if they believe that the people on the Internet are not real , their opinions do not count , and the Internet polls could not possibly be correct .
The argument is absurd , insulting and designed to keep Ron Paul out of the mainstream public ’s eye .
The MSM ignores his success because of the misguided concept that people do not want to “ waste ” a vote .
It is never a waste to vote for what you want : indeed , nothing could be more wasteful than voting for what you do not want because you think it the lesser of two evils .
Voting for evil is always a bad idea .
Not only is the MSM staying mum to keep you from seeing Ron Paul as a legitimate candidate but there have been active attempts to hide information about his successes .
After the third debate CNN not only ran a poll , but also asked viewers to voice their opinions about the debates .
Comments started pouring in supporting Ron Paul , along with all the votes .
The next day CNN removed the comments from their webpage .
Clever supporters found these lost comments through Google ’s cache ( a technology that takes a virtual picture of a webpage on a certain date , so you can see if it has changed ) .
When silence does not work , biased pundits accuse Ron Paul supporters of “ spamming ” the votes ( that is voting over and over for their candidate ) and claim that this huge show of support is really being done by a few campaigners .
This claim is specious for several reasons .
First , if it was so easy to spam the polls , all the candidates would do it and online polling numbers would look more like an American Idol session with tens of millions of votes cast .
Second , anyone , who understands that the Internet is not a series of tubes , knows that it is easy for a web designer to develop a poll that prohibits more than one vote per person .
In fact , most of the online polls do restrict you to voting only once and if you attempt to vote again , even weeks later , you get a polite message that your vote will not count .
Finally , along with the polls themselves , people leave comments , thousands of individual comments .
So let ’s look at these polls and their methodologies .
Many online polls have tens of thousands of responses , especially the ones done by the MSM immediately after the debates , while old - fashioned telephone pollsters only get responses from hundreds .
Yet , only the old telephone polls are reported on by the MSM .
We are asked to accept that a poll with 600 persons responding is more accurate than a poll with 70,000 respondents .
For example , a much - cited Zogby poll admits that they only targeted 500 interviews and drew their samples randomly from telephone CD ’s of a national listed sample .
( In that poll Ron Paul has a 3 % lead ) .
A recent Washington
Post article cited its own telephone poll that only reached 1205 adults , and that was used to say Ron Paul is only receiving 1 % support .
Instead of citing polls that have 70 to 100 times more respondents , the MSM still sticks to old - fashioned telephone - polling methods .
The world has changed .
We no longer need to depend on poor polls that only call a few hundred people , nor should we be relying on them to tell the whole story .
Some say random telephone sampling is more effective just because of its randomness and therefore there is no self - selection bias as in the online polls in which one chooses to partake .
However , elections are also based on self - selection and are only won and lost by those who choose to go to the polls : so should n’t the self - selected polling methods be more accurate ?
The good news is that of those who have heard Ron Paul speak ( if only for the 5 minutes or so he gets in the debates ) he is leading by a landslide ; unfortunately , not enough people are getting to hear about him .
This race would look much different if the leading headlines the days following the GOP debates were ( in order of the debates ) : 1 . Ron Paul takes GOP by surprise and WINS the debate .
2 . Ron Paul once again a leading contender in second debate , comes in second .
3 . Ron Paul wins third debate hands down : other candidates struggling to keep up .
If the people were told Ron Paul won the debates , more would learn about him and his support would grow exponentially .
In all fairness , the polls that show that Ron Paul is ahead with 98 % of the vote are just as inaccurate as the polls that show he is only polling at 1 % and the truth lies somewhere in the middle .
But the largest online polls , the ones taken after the debates , have him receiving somewhere between 45 % and 60 % of the votes .
So , why the big disparity in polling numbers ?
Some have suggested that Ron Paul has a lot of young supporters who do not own landlines and thus are not being polled .
Other explanations come to mind as well : 1 . Typical polls will only call a certain type of voter e.g. people who voted Republican in the last election and this will leave out a lot of Ron Paul supporters .
Ron Paul ’s message of liberty and freedom reaches across the aisle and a lot of previously registered Democrats are switching parties to vote for him in this election .
For the same reason , many Libertarians and Independents are also going to be voting as Republicans this election .
Much of his support also comes from young people who are voting in their first Presidential election and thus would have no previous voting record .
2 . Ron Paul ’s message of freedom and liberty is so exciting that people who have decided not to vote in past elections have decided that finally they have someone for whom to vote .
3 . Some polls are so biased they do not even list Ron Paul as a choice ( coincidentally , in a few of those “ other ” is leading the pack ) :
Hard to win a poll when your name is not on the list .
4 . Ron Paul fights for the individual , not the government , and his message appeals to those who like to be left alone .
During this election many individuals have caller ID and often choose to avoid telemarketers and callers they do not know .
5 . Some of these polls begin with intrusive questions about a person ’s gender , religious affiliation , annual income , and other information some see as none of anyone ’s business .
If you refuse to answer the initial questions they will not continue with the questions .
The type of person that likes Ron Paul , also tends to like privacy .
6 . Sadly , not enough people are getting to hear about his policies .
Once they hear him , Ron Paul ’s supporters are very passionate about his message .
A search of Internet “ blogs ” shows people writing zealously about him .
Nothing could be more thrilling than to see an 18 - year - old excited about the election process , shouting out support for Ron Paul , begging to hear more information about the Federal Reserve and its implications for the country .
Through his campaign , Ron Paul is teaching many the benefits of limited government .
There should be no surprise that his message is so well received ; it is the one taught to us by Thomas Jefferson , George Washington and other founding fathers .
It is the message of liberty , freedom , with the basis of a republic , not a democracy .
We have been lied to so often , and our Constitution ripped apart at the seams , that when a person comes along speaking basic truths and principles , it awakens a part of us buried for so long .
When ignoring Ron Paul does not work , and removing messages about him receives backlash , the next stage is to call his supporters rabid , nuts , crazy , unstable .
If you cannot attack the man , attack his supporters .
Yet who can blame people who get upset when a life - saving message comes along and the MSM tries to keep it from the public .
Ron Paul ’s message is life - saving .
He wants to end the war , he wants to help ease poverty by eliminating the Federal Reserve and its ability to steal through monetary inflation .
He wants to end the Income Tax and give those who need it most their entire salaries .
The anger you hear is frustration by his supporters at being marginalized , just as they are by so many government actions these days , and fury when all this support is discounted .
Of course people are getting upset .
They do not like being manipulated and they especially do not like it when a Presidential campaign is being hijacked .
The worst part about the MSM treatment of Ron Paul , is that finally the people have a candidate they really love , and a man who would get this country back on the proper course .
They have a man who will follow the Constitutional course that served this country so well for so long .
Instead of rejoicing and helping the country and the people find their way , corporate media giants are trying to silence his message by ignoring him completely or reporting on only the most obscure , misleading and slanderous articles ( could this be because Ron Paul is also against corporate welfare ? ) .
Most recently , even the Associated Press got into the “ let ’s lead with misleading statements ” game .
In reporting on how Dr. Paul decided to hold his own rally after being the only candidate in the debates to not be invited to a Presidential Forum in Iowa , the AP ’s first line in the article was that Ron Paul has added “ party crashing ” to his debate tactics .
As any ten - year - old knows , to crash a party you have to attend the party .
Ron Paul had not announced he would attend the Presidential forum .
Instead , he decided to hold a completely separate event immediately following the forum in the same venue .
That is not party crashing , that is called campaigning .
The article went on to tell the truth about the situation , but that catch phrase was repeated as a headline across the country impugning Dr. Paul ’s character .
See for example this ABC News headline : Republican Ron Paul to Crash Iowa Forum .
Just as Ron Paul spoke of blowback in the context of military interference in foreign affairs , unless the mainstream media ends the Ron Paul blackout and misinformation drive , they will lose the next generation who is seeing it as a biased , manipulating , election - fixing force not to be trusted .
When Ron Paul gets heard or seen , he is liked .
As soon as people who do not own computers are able to see him or read his message his numbers in the national polls will rise just as they have done on the Internet .
In general , the American people are saying they want liberty and freedom : Now , if only the MSM would listen .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A leading Democratic lawmaker on Tuesday accused Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice of interfering in congressional inquiries into corruption in Iraq ’s government and the activities of U.S. security firm Blackwater .

Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman said State Department officials had told the Oversight and Government Reform Committee he chairs they could not provide details of corruption in Iraq ’s government unless the information was treated as a “ state secret ” and not revealed to the public .
“ You are wrong to interfere with the committee ’s inquiry , ” Waxman said in a letter to Rice .
“ The State Department ’s position on this matter is ludicrous , ” added Waxman , a vocal opponent of the Bush administration ’s Iraq policies .
The State Department had no immediate comment on the letter or Waxman ’s allegations of interference but it has in the past dismissed the California lawmaker ’s comments as partisan .
Waxman said security contractor Blackwater , which was involved in an incident in which Iraqi civilians were killed last week , said they could not hand over documents relevant to an investigation without State Department approval .
“ Congress has a constitutional prerogative to examine the impacts that corruption within the Iraqi ministries and the activities of Blackwater may have on the prospects for political reconciliation in Iraq , ” Waxman wrote to Rice .
Blackwater provides security for the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and has a contract with the State Department .
The company was involved in a September 16 shooting in which 11 people were killed while Blackwater was escorting a convoy through Baghdad .
The State Department is investigating the incident along with the Iraqis .
Waxman , who has called a hearing on Blackwater for October 2 , released a letter his staff received from the security contractor ’s attorneys dated September 24 .
“ It ( the State Department ) directs Blackwater USA not to disclose any information concerning the contract without DOS ( Department of State ) preauthorization in writing . ”
Blackwater also urged the committee not to ask questions at the hearing that could reveal sensitive information “ that could be utilized by our country ’s implacable enemies in Iraq . ”
Such information included the size of their security staff in Baghdad , weaponry and the operation of convoys .
Waxman also released a letter signed by State Department contracting officer Kiazan Moneypenny to Blackwater .
“ I hereby direct Blackwater to make no disclosure of documents or information ... unless such disclosure has been authorized in writing by the contracting officer , ” wrote Moneypenny .
Waxman also complained Rice was refusing to testify at any hearings his committee planned to look at political reconciliation in Iraq , corruption or the Blackwater incident .
In November 2005 I presented on pro.html .it a three - part article on creating CSS layouts using techniques like negative margins , any order columns and in some case opposite floats .
The main goal of the article was getting the maximum number of layouts based on the same markup , each with valid CSS and HTML , without hacks nor workaround and a good cross - browser compatibility .
The result is a set of 40 layouts that we 've thought worth sharing : on each of them you 'll find also a download link ( if you want , you can download the entire collection , 40 HTML pages in a single zip file ) .
Further details can be found below the gallery .
Further details
All layouts use valid markup and CSS , and have been tested successfully on Internet Explorer / win 5.0 , 5.5 , 6 and beta 2 preview of version 7 ; Opera 8.5 , Firefox 1.5 and Safari 2 .
Each of the columns could be the longest , and for testing columns length I 've used the script filler text on demand .
Each layout could represent a site with five main sections : header , content , navigation , other stuff and footer .
The basic markup , common to every layout , is the following :
< div id =" container " >
< div id =" header " >
Header </div >
< div id =" wrapper " >
< div id =" content " > Content</div >
</div >
< div id =" navigation " > Navigation </div >
< div id =" extra " >
Extra stuff</div >
< div id =" footer " >
Footer </div >
</div >
It 's almost minimal , apart from an extra wrapper around the content .
Some might argue that the extra div it 's unsemantical : all I can say is that in my opinion an extra wrapper in the markup is certainly better than CSS hacking , and to be able to meet the objectives I fixed for the article I needed at least a solid starting point .
Talking about CSS : each of the layouts uses float and in most of the cases negative margins .
Once you 've understand how they work , they are really simple and powerful .
There are two main things to know : first , a negative margin according to the side of float has the effect of shifting even more the floated elements towards the side of float ; the second one is that a negative margin on the opposite side of float does not affect the floated element position , but has the only effect to yeld space for eventual flanking element on the side of the negative margin .
The CSS of the examples , which is embedded in both online and download versions , has been kept to the minimum in order to focus on the most important thing , as is the layout .
In fact , the CSS has been divided , with an empty line , between two logical parts : the first is for typography and colors , while the second and most important is for the layout itself .
No graphics was used in the examples , but if you 'll feel the need , you may want to apply techniques such as Faux Columns and Sliding Faux Columns .
That 's all for now : enjoy !

Club drug relieves symptoms and boosts other treatments .
Ecstasy appears to relieve symptoms in mice in a different way from known treatments .

The drug ecstasy relieves the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease in mice , a team of researchers has found .
The scientists did not look at the drug 's effects in people , and do not advocate self - medication .
" We do n't want to give the idea that every Parkinson 's patient should be standing on the street corner trying to buy amphetamines , " says team leader Marc Caron , a cell biologist at Duke University in Durham , North Carolina .
Nevertheless , the team is hopeful that their findings may point to new treatments for Parkinson's , a debilitating disorder in which patients lose the ability to control their actions .
“ We do n't want to give the idea that every Parkinson 's patient should be standing on the street corner trying to buy amphetamines . ”
Marc Caron
Duke University
Caron 's team looked at genetically altered mice that lack the brain chemical dopamine .
As in humans with low dopamine levels , these mice exhibit Parkinson 's - like symptoms , such as tremors and stiff limbs .
The team then dosed the mice with chemicals , looking for drugs that might alleviate their symptoms .
What worked best , they found , was methylenedioxymehtamphetamine ( MDMA ) , a drug better known as ecstasy .
But MDMA did not raise dopamine levels , hinting that it restores movement through an unknown mechanism outside of the dopamine system .
Better together
The team also found that a combination of MDMA and the current Parkinson 's drug L - DOPA , a chemical building block of dopamine was more effective than either drug alone .
" This suggests that maybe low concentrations of these amphetamines , or compounds related to them , could be potentially used as add - ons to L - DOPA , " says Caron .
The study is reported in PloS Biology1 .
Caron aims to search for drugs that act similarly to MDMA .
He does not advise giving MDMA to Parkinson 's patients , but hopes to find other chemicals that mimic its effects .

The new results are ironic , given that three years ago a study suggested that ecstasy might cause Parkinson 's - like symptoms in monkeys2 .
But the researchers who published that study retracted it after they realized they had mixed up ecstacy with methamphetamine , commonly known as speed3 .

In 1810 , U.S. Senator Philip Reed of Maryland proposed the above amendment to the U.S. Constitution , essentially stating that anyone accepting a title of nobility would be stripped of their citizenship .
Under such an amendment , individuals like Sir Rudy Giuliani , or possibly even lawyers adopting the title ' esquire ' , could lose their status as U.S. citizens .
At the time , 13 states were needed to ratify the amendment , but only 12 are known to have done so prior to the war of 1812 .
Controversy arises because most government records were lost when the British burned down Washington DC in 1814 .
Some people now believe that the amendment was actually ratified , as did many states and government agencies throughout the 1800's .
Even the U.S. President , James Madison , was apparently unsure of the amendment 's status and sent delegates to undecided states in 1817 to determine if they had voted to have it ratified .
Officially , the amendment was never ratified , but remains open for ratification if enough states vote to do so .
However , many state and federal printings of the Constitution included the amendment until around the Civil War , lending credibility to the theory that it was ratified and later swept under the table once the new 13th amendment abolishing slavery was added .
Was it a conspiracy ?
Or just a case of misunderstood constitutional law and bad record keeping ?

Libby judge questions Bush commutation as Judiciary Committee prepares hearings Michael Roston

The House Judiciary Committee plans hearings next week into President George W. Bush 's decision to commute the sentence of convicted former White House aide I. Lewis ' Scooter ' Libby .
They are likely to focus their inquiry into whether Bush 's commuting of a jail sentence that had not yet been served was appropriate after the key judge in the Libby case questioned the President 's act .
Federal District Judge Reggie Walton , who sentenced Libby to 30 months in jail for perjury , obstruction of justice , and making false statements in the investigation of the outing of Plame , raised concerns about the President 's commutation of Libby in a Tuesday filing .
He suggested that the commutation cannot be used without Libby first serving time in jail .
" It has been brought to the Court 's attention that the United States Probation Office for the District Court of the District of Columbia intends to contact [ Scooter Libby ] imminently to require him to begin his term of supervised release .
Strictly construed , the statute authorizing the imposition of supervised release indicates that such release should occur only after the defendant has already served a term of imprisonment , " Walton wrote in the filing , which was posted at the Sentencing Law and Policy Blog on Tuesday .
He added , " [ Section 3583 , the law in question ] does not appear to contemplate a situation in which a defendant may be placed under supervised release without first completing a term of incarceration . "
Tony Snow was asked a related question in a Tuesday morning press conference .
He said the president was ruling out any jail time for Libby .
" He thought that any jail time was excessive .
And therefore , he did not see fit to have Scooter Libby taken to jail , " the White House Press Secretary stated , after a reporter pointed out that " Normally , somebody at least serves a day in jail , a week in jail , a month in jail , " before a commutation is granted .
In a statement to RAW STORY Tuesday , Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , said the decision to commute Libby 's sentence required congressional oversight .
" In light of yesterday 's announcement by the President that he was commuting the prison sentence for Scooter Libby , it is imperative that Congress look into presidential authority to grant clemency , and how such power may be abused , " Conyers said in a statement released to RAW STORY Tuesday night .
" Taken to its extreme , the use of such authority could completely circumvent the law enforcement process and prevent credible efforts to investigate wrongdoing in the executive branch . "
Another Democratic Congress member agreed with the Chairman .
" The President 's blatant disregard for the rule of law proves that Democrats must redouble their efforts to hold this administration accountable , " Rep. Carolyn Maloney ( D - NY ) told the New York Daily News . '
The hearing is scheduled for Wednesday , July 11 , at 10:15 AM .
The committee has not yet announced the witnesses who will testify at the hearing .
Global warming is destroying ponds that have supported life in the Arctic for thousands of years – bad news for the North and an ominous warning to the rest of the world , says a new report by two Canadian scientists .
The small , shallow ponds on Ellesmere Island , high in Canada 's Eastern Arctic , are drying up and could begin to release greenhouse gases that make the problem worse , says John Smol , a biologist at Queen 's University in Kingston .
" What happens in the Arctic will affect us all , and not in good ways , " says Smol , co-author of the report with Marianne Douglas of the University of Alberta in Edmonton .
It is being published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Their findings are the latest in a series of troubling studies that show how global warming is transforming the Arctic .
The region is heating up further and faster than any other place on Earth , and " it 's the first to show signs of change , " Smol says .
It 's like the canaries that were kept in mines to warn of bad air : " The canary is singing – it's coughing and choking . "
The Eastern Arctic is dotted by thousands of ponds – some just 30 or 40 metres long .
Until now , they 've been locked in ice most of the year and survived the brief , cool summers , bursting into life during that short open spell .
Smol has been visiting 40 ponds since 1983 on Cape Herschel , on the east side of Ellesmere Island , and Douglas joined the research three years later .
They 've also studied fossils in the pond sediments dating back 5,000 years .
The fossil record shows the ponds were stable until 100 years ago , when industrial pollution put enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to launch the warming process .
Until recently , the alterations were subtle .
Photos taken by others in 1959 and 1973 show the ponds were full of water in midsummer .
But the mix of microscopic life was changing – evidence of the impact of higher temperatures and an ice - free season that 's at least a month longer than two decades ago .
In 2005 and again last year – the two hottest years on record in the Arctic – many ponds dried up completely .
So , too , did much of the tundra around them :
Moss that was wet in July can now be set on fire .
" A key `tipping point ' has now been passed .
Arctic ponds that were permanent water bodies for millennia are now ephemeral , " the report states .
" The ecological implications of these changes are likely severe and will cascade throughout the Arctic ecosystem . "
The ponds are drying even though the past two summers were wetter than average , the report states .
Increased evaporation caused by the warmer temperatures and reduced ice cover far outstripped the extra precipitation .
The result is that temporary ponds have vanished , permanent ponds are now temporary and bigger lakes are shrinking .
The wet areas are full of algae and are breeding pools for insects – major foundations for the Arctic 's fragile ecosystem .
Although little is known about how the food chain operates , the loss of these areas is bound to have a major impact .
The potential impact on global warming , though , is clear .
The algae consume and store carbon .
Without them , it 's no longer absorbed .
And , if the dry tundra burns , carbon dioxide will be released , adding to the greenhouse effect .
The new report adds to the evidence of Arctic warming , with the threat Greenland 's massive ice cap will melt , raising sea levels and flooding coastal areas around the globe , and altering ocean currents .

While satellite tracking of polar sea ice has been done only since 1979 , several ice experts who have studied Russian and Alaskan records going back many decades said the ice retreat this year was probably unmatched in the 20th century , including during a warm period in the 1930s .
“ I do not think that there was anything like we observe today ” in the 1930s or 1940s , said Igor Polyakov , an ice expert at the University of Alaska , Fairbanks .
Image A satellite image from last Saturday shows shrinking ice opening Canadas Northwest Passage .
Scientists said on Thursday that this years ice retreat was probably unmatched in the 20th century .

The ice retreat has been particularly striking this year .
The Alaskan side of the Arctic Ocean has stretches of thousands of square miles of open water ; the fabled Northwest Passage through the islands of northern Canada was free of ice for weeks ; and the sea route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans north of Russia was nearly clear a week ago , with one small clot of ice around a group of Siberian islands .
Mark Serreze , a senior researcher at the snow and ice center , said it was increasingly clear that climate change from the buildup of greenhouse gases was playing a role in the Arctic warming , which is seen not only in the floating ice but also in melting terrestrial ice sheets , thawing tundra and warming seawater .
“ We understand the physics behind what ’s going on , ” Dr. Serreze said .
“ You can always find some aspect of natural variability that can explain some things .
But now it seems patterns that used to help you do n’t help as much anymore , and the ones that hurt you hurt you more . ”
“ You ca n’t dismiss this as natural variability , ” he said .
“ We ’re starting to see the system respond to global warming . ”
The organisers of London 2012 may have foreseen some of the criticism they have received since unveiling the Olympic logo - variously derided as an uninspiring emblem , a puerile mess , an artistic flop .
But yesterday evening , they were forced to pull the promotional video for the new brand from the official website after complaints from a completely unexpected quarter - Britain 's epileptics .
In the two and a half minute animation , the logo comes alive , springing from athletes ' bodies and bouncing vividly across the city , and one flashing section has triggered seizures .
As the flow of complaints about the quality of the £ 400,000 brand gathered pace yesterday ( the emblem was likened to a " broken swastika " and a " toileting monkey " ) , one viewer , Christopher Filmer , rang the BBC to say he suffered a seizure while watching the footage on television and his girlfriend had also suffered a fit and needed hospital treatment .
" The logo came up on TV and I was thinking about the 2012 games and then I was out , " he told BBC London 94.9 FM .
Last night it emerged that eight people had suffered seizures and several people had contacted the charity Epilepsy Action to say they had been affected .
One section of the film , in which a diver plunges into a pool with a multicolour ripple effect , is thought to have triggered the seizures .
Graham Harding , a clinical neurophysiology expert who developed a test to measure photo sensitivity levels in TV material , said the video breached Ofcom regulations and should not be broadcast .
The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games pulled the animation from the site last night and said it was looking into it as a matter of urgency .
" We have just been notified of the problem and we have taken immediate steps to remove the animation from the website , " a spokeswoman said .
" We will now re-edit the film . "
She said a five - second section of the animation , rather than the logo itself , had prompted the problems .
Epilepsy Action said the images could affect the 23,000 people in the UK who have photosensitive epilepsy .
Yes , I ’ve been a critic of the prospects of the campaign , but this clip had me yelling “ Hell , yeah ” all along

Swiss citizen Oliver Jufer , who pleaded guilty to insulting the Thai king by spray - painting portraits , has been jailed for 10 years under Thailand 's rarely used " lese - majeste " law .
Thailand is not the only state to prosecute those who offend their head of state , though few such laws are as draconian .
Its law carries a maximum prison sentence of 75 years .
One step beyond - Henry VIII equated lese Majeste with Treason
The concept of " lese - majeste " ( literally , injury to the Majesty ) as a crime goes back to ancient Rome and was jealously guarded by absolute monarchs in medieval Europe , while something similar existed in Asian cultures .
In Brunei , which like Thailand is ruled by a monarchy , three men were jailed for a year in 2006 for sending mobile phone clips judged seditious and insulting to Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and his family .
Laws protecting the " dignity " of a monarch have been borrowed by many modern republics .
In the Indian Ocean state of the Maldives , three journalists were sentenced to life in 2002 for " insulting the president " and setting up a newsletter critical of the government .
In Poland , a member of the European Union , you can technically get up to three years for offending the president .
Given that Mr Jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better

That protection is extended to any foreign head of state visiting the country .
Thus police arrested 28 demonstrators in 2005 who were protesting against President Vladimir Putin of Russia , a country which has not enjoyed good relations with its western neighbour at the best of times .
The chief concern about insult laws among human rights campaigners is that they can be used to stifle freedom of expression .
A basic right " Freedom of speech is one of the most basic human rights , " a spokesperson for Amnesty International told the BBC News website .
Egypt jailed blogger Abdel Kareem Soliman for insulting its leader " No state should be prosecuting any individual for expressing an opinion held peacefully . "
Amnesty is not quibbling with laws on defamation or incitement which , it says , rightfully exist in any state to protect individuals and the community .
But other than these recognised limits on freedom of speech , there should be no restrictions , it argues .
Republics which have prosecuted people for insulting their heads of state in recent years are typified by authoritarian leaders An Egyptian court sentenced blogger Abdel Kareem Soliman in February to four years in prison for insulting Islam and President Hosni Mubarak
Kazakhstan gave journalist Kaziz Toguzbayev a two - year suspended sentence in January for " insulting the honour and dignity " of President Nursultan Nazarbayev
Zimbabwe gave a two - year suspended sentence to businessman Jason Gambitzs in 2004 for denigrating President Robert Mugabe by saying he had " printed useless money "
Belarus sentenced two opposition figures , Valeriy Levonevskiy and Alexander Vasiliev , in 2004 for publicly insulting President Alexander Lukashenko
Syria sentenced journalist Mohammad Ghanem to six months in prison in 2006 for charges which included insulting President Bashar al - Assad Access to the popular video - sharing website YouTube was suspended in Turkey this month after prosecutors told a court that clips had appeared on the site insulting national hero Mustafa Kemal Ataturk - who has been dead for nearly 70 years .
Rebellious or rude ?
Freedom of speech was not , strictly speaking , at issue in Thailand 's prosecution of Oliver Jufer , who admitted spray - painting several portraits of the king while drunk .
Many in Thailand see King Bhumibol as an anchor of stability " It was the idea that being rude about a government was a very bad idea - it hurt the government but was technically not treason because no act of rebellion was committed , " Prof Ronald Hutton of Bristol University told the BBC News website .
" In the days before the idea of constitutional opposition , any opposition was regarded as criminal and anybody who spoke against the government had to be prosecuted because it could incite rebellion . "
If the concept now sounds obscure in that other leading contemporary monarchy Britain , it is thanks to King Henry VIII ( 1491 - 1547 ) , who took personal injury one step further .
" Traditionally you have a division in countries between acts against the monarch which are treason and rude things said against the monarch which are ' lese - majeste ' , " Prof Hutton explains .
" But Henry VIII passed an act which made speaking against the king treason in itself so ' lese - majeste ' became redundant . "
Before anyone gets unduly anxious about offending Queen Elizabeth II , it should be pointed out that British parliamentarians dealt with that part of Henry 's act long ago .
Since the 1790s , Prof Hutton points out , Britain has had freedom of speech legislation which covers most of what was once " Treason - by - words " .
Your comments Well ... if you are walking down the street in London facing massive Queen 's portraits on every corner , pretty sure you will be intimidated or annoyed .

When in Asia , do as the Asians , please . "

This is truly shocking .
Respect is earned , not ordained .
I respect the Thai people .
They have to live and work under such capricious and vile laws .
I have zero respect for their King that does n't rationally find such laws inhumane ...
He 's been given the fate of millions by birthright without ever earning that enormous right and responsibility .
Us " Westerners " may not be the beacons of honour and morality to most of you , certainly my country 's leadership is lacking beyond imaging , but I am proud they 're thick - skinned enough not to be disassembled by mere insults .
How fragile Thailand 's monarchy must be if they fear the act of a drunkard ...
I question the upbringing of some of you that support this garbage .
Any of those that suggest to blindly follow authority have clearly lost some capability ... called thinking .
If you defend such onerous nonsense , you should be jailed along with the drunk , for supporting such dangerous laws of repression that clearly is a danger to all of Thailand ...
From the country that can take its punches and give some back .
Peace .

Thai living in many countries abroad longer than in Thailand I find some opinions on the issue most interesting while others to be downright pitiful .
When one travels the world one cannot just hold on to one 's own supreme standard but adjust and adapt as one goes along - to make the most of what are on offer and to one 's own benefits and enjoyment .
The Swiss has lived for a decade in one of the most beautiful cities in the world with a mild climate , well - mannered gentle people and great choices of food , and at a fraction of what he would have to pay in Switzerland .
One day he got drunk and did what not only goes against the law but is also the most offensive act to the Thais .
Is this not the case of taking out of the land more than he put in ?
He should have left the country if and when he's so unhappy at the way it 's governed .
In my opinion he deserves what he 's got , perhaps he will make himself useful while serving his sentence ?
I do believe , however , that he will be pardoned one day .
And in a larger picture , I hope , a lesson is learned ( or is it not ? ) and the point is made .
And to those ignorant few the Thai King has worked extremely hard throughout his life for his own people and the land , and in so doing he has earned the highest respect and love from his own people .
He is our father .
I now wish to ask how do you treat your own selfless father ?
And how would you feel & react when someone tries to knock him down ?

When I lived in Thai refugee camps in the 80s , we were not allowed to mess with Thai Baht which have the king 's pictures or emblem on them .
Refugees were beaten up every day just because their lack of respect for the Thai King .
Even when the Thai national anthem is playing , no matter where you are or what you do , you must stand still and straight .
If Thailand means the land of the free , then it should reconsider it name .
S. Ley , Santa Ana , US I'm a Filipino living in Japan for the last 6 years and have met many Thai nationals , and I can say that they truly have a deep respect for their King .
For those who criticize the Thai monarch for being pompous or having a temper , I would like to say that the King does not charge anyone with " lese majeste " ( and if I 'm not mistaken , has never had , at least in contemporary Thailand ) ; it 's the police that does .
There are cases wherein the said law was indeed abused ( i.e. when politicians accuse their rivals ) , but in the case of Mr. Jufer , his actions are similar to flag - burning / defacing of national symbols and should be punished , although I would agree that the sentence is draconian indeed .
Christian Ernest , Oita , Japan Everyone in Thailand knows the respect that the royal family , and in particular the King , are held in .
Of course one should do what is expected of you in a different country and culture .
Having said that the law regarding the Thai monarchy serves no one but the powerful - who have managed to hide behind it for their political advantage before ( example Thaksin expelling critical foreign journalists on the grounds they insulted the monarchy ) .
This rule does Thailand no favours , laws are not needed for the King to be respected ( he has it already ) , social mores are enough to ensure respect is given - it only shows Thailand in a poor way to the international community .
Tim , Seoul Korea Given that Mr Jurer comes from a country that has such strict rules about when to take the garbage out , what time you can mow the lawn or wash your clothes , he really should know better .
I agree with Derek from Canada .
The rule is simple : Respect the rules of the country you are in , otherwise stay home .

The guy has absolutely no excuse .
As foreigners in this country we are all well aware of Thais ' respect for their monarch .
They and most foreigners still stand for the national anthem in the cinema before a film .
I am sorry but it 's values like this that form a National Identity and give a people pride .
What would happen if you played the national anthem before a film in the UK ?
Also the offender will have been well aware in advance that he would be unable to buy alcohol on this day and should have done like all sensible foreigners here and had a supply at home .

Although the court ruling of ten years is very severe , the point in fact is that Oliver Jufer was disrespectful and vandalous .
He not only went on a rampage of vandalism throughout the city of Chang Mai but also chose to degrade symbols of the very core of society in the country that was hosting him .
If we had strict such punishment and reverence for our cultural symbols there might be a lot less vandalism in our communities as well .
Respect for property and cultural symbols is innate to any nation and this man deliberately went contrary to the respect of that land .
He deserves to be punished .
Antonio , Tokyo , Japan
Folks need to remember that yes , as draconian and exaggerated as the sentence may appear ... this law is not imposed or even necessarily acknowledged by the king , but is enforced more so by all his subjects who see him as someone who very genuinely holds his people to heart and see him as the one pivotal figure of stability in a country with a history fraught with political instability and corruption and just as any of you might feel angered , even vengeful perhaps at someone demonstrating total , uncalled for disrespect to your immediate family members , so do the Thai people feel protective of their king whom they lovingly refer to as father .
long term expat resident in Thailand , Bangkok I find this ridiculous ...
In the 21st century today , people can even freely criticise or insult the gods - who does the Thai king think he is ?
God ? or superior than gods ?
Outrageous !
People should boycott travel industry in Thailand .
Such country is a horrified country , every single tourist in there must be cautioned over the unstable politics and their " sacred " king ... who knows maybe some day a single wrong saying about their king there can cost your fortune and life .
Wake up , it 's the 21st century not the feudal era .
Everyone is an equal individual ,
We do n't need anyone superior over us .
X , UK having lived in parts of asia for years , I kinda get the whole respects for monarchy thing - its not about respecting a terrifying institution , but about respecting an institution that symbolises a nation and a people , in a way .
If individuals in parts of the ' free ' west can be charged under law for burning the flag of certain nations , what difference defacing a poster depicting a symbol of another ?
If this guy had been simply an ignorant tourist , then he would n't know better , but he had lived in the country for 10 years .
Though I hope he is pardoned , I understand why a nation that has made him welcome for such a time might not feel inclined to let him off lightly .

Yet another travesty of Thai " Justice " .
This says far more about Thailand than it does about Oliver Jufer ; Draconian sentences like the one handed down today serve no purpose in the 21st century other than to maintain already fraught divisions between Western and Eastern cultures .
Marc , London
If King Bhumibol can truly call himself as such then he should step in and pardon Oliver Jufer .

No one brings anything into the world at birth , no one will take anything out of it at death .
Everybody , including monarchs , should bear that in mind .

While we enjoy the privilege of international travel , especially to places in Asia , we are made aware of , and therefore must abide by , all national and international laws .
Many foreigners travelling through such countries seem to think that they are above these laws and that they only apply to the " locals " and that their respective embassies will step up and get them out of trouble .
It 's simple , respect the laws of the countries that let you in .
Derek Junor , Toronto , Canada
The countries you mentioned are just the tip of the ice - berg .
Regimes which need these repressive laws to avoid accountability and shut down public debate are the real traitors .
Adrian , Melbourne , Australia For Murdoch in Prague :
It seems clear from your comments that you understand nothing of respectability , opinions , laws or customs of other countries .
I do wonder what kind of upbringing you were subjected to that you cannot see the man was wrong in insulting and not respecting His Majesty the King .
Furthermore , I do not believe His Majesty sees Westerners as threats .
The whole issue fundamentally lies with respecting one 's culture , which the West seems to have forgotten how to .
Any patriots would understand that .
If you are one , and find your country insulted , I doubt you would write what you , sadly , have written .
Respectfully yours , M in Oxford .
M , Oxford Honestly , I find this rather comic and cruel at the same time , on one side you have a drunk and on the other , a king , who in my opinion , must have an explosive temper and turn purple at the mere idea of him being put down .
Yes it may be against the law to do so , yet if all of a sudden the king says that he feels that anyone from the West is a threat and should be kicked out to maintain his ego , is that right ?
No , and all this is is one person poking fun at the king .
It poses no threat to the king at all .
So why freak out over an insult ?
Now this may sound harsh but why not just quit being self - saturated and care for your people for they are the ones keeping your country alive , it 's not all you sir .
Murdoch , Prague .

It is appalling that such extreme laws still exist .
The king of Thailand may be loved by his people , but since it is illegal to report anything but good news , they cannot possibly know what he is really like .
Maybe he is as wonderful as they think , but maybe not .
These draconian laws do not help the monarchy , except to stifle and control any opposition .
I think they are used to stop ordinary Thai people learning the truth about how their country is run behind the scenes and by whom .
Mary Aquila , Stockholm , Sweden I think it was just a rude act , and an apology should suffice .
Personally , I believe it is most insulting to other human to consider oneself a king or queen .
Are n't we all created equal ?
Jamila Thomas , USA / kwt Sorry , I am Chinese , but I still find this ridiculous .
I know in the ancient Asian couture , these kind of acts are very serious crimes .
Not just Asia , but I guess everywhere of the world .
However , in modern world ?
No way .
Do n't claim this Asian culture , maybe it 's a Thai culture , but it 's not an Asian culture , it 's a feudal and out of date practice .
In modern Asian societies , we do n't think this " lese Majeste " act is any good thing and can represent Asian culture .
Never !
PS , I criticise our Chinese Communist leaders and their policies everyday , even the former chairman Mao .
Ming , China
In the Far East , we respect our monarchs not only as part of our culture , but even to the extend of our beliefs ( divine majesty ) sometimes .
As such the view of lese Majeste is somewhat more serious compared to the " openness " of Western culture .
You say , when in Rome , do as the Romans .
I say , when in Asia , do as the Asians , please .
T.Chunlakorn , Thailand I 've lived in Thailand for the past five years .
The guy should have known better .
There 's no excuse .
But for " P. Kamao " from Kenya , saying that it 's normal for Westerners not to have any respect , is a foolish and contradictory statement .
I 've been to Africa as an NGO and I 've seen the respect that your " elders " have given to the people .
And it was n't pretty .
And I 've lived in Asia long enough to realize there is no respect in driving .
This was simply someone making a stupid decision .
You have to remember there are thousands of other Westerners living in countries like Thailand who are respectful .
T. Johnson , Bangkok , Thailand
You know , it may seem outrageous from the Western perspective !
But Western people should know that respect is very important in most cultures and societies especially in Asia and Africa .
I think the Swiss man is paying for his bad bringing up !
perhaps he grew up without any sense of respect for anybody including his elders , the trend of which is so familiar and normal in western children and adults .

" This is the best thing to happen to me in a long , long time .
Check my filings , sweetie . "
Gaming - crazed attorney Jack Thompson may be best known for suing 2 Live Crew and the makers of the Bully video game , but , as the good folks at GamePolitics noted yesterday , this tough - as - nails litigator still finds the time to cruise gay hardcore sites and dig up dirt on rivals .
His legal career apparently hanging by the lightest of lashes , the all - purpose anti-everything Christian crusader last week filed graphic man -love sex photos in federal court in a futile attempt to discredit Florida state bar ethics and lunacy proceedings against him .
Never one to be deterred by the swoosh of the oncoming black helicopters , Thompson 's recent court filings ( pdf ) have taken on a conspiratorial tone .
The Bar ’s demonstrable mindset is that the “ enemy of my enemy is my friend , ” as indicated by The Bar ’s enthusiastic , recidivist collaboration with Mr. Kent , over a twenty year period , at Thompson ’s expense .
Lunacy proceedings have been sought and secured , Bar complaints have recently been maintained for nearly three years .
Although better known for his campaigns against violent video games , which he holds responsible for the DC sniper rampage a few years back , some serious hardcore man- on - man action apparently gets a rise out of Thompson , too .
Norm Kent , a Florida criminal defense attorney and longtime Thompson foe , publishes the National Gay News website .
Always angling to skewer his gay nemesis , Thompson laid into Kent in court filings last week for “ distribution of hardcore porn to anyone of any age . ”
To prove his point , Thompson went to the site , found some especially hot links , stole the copyrighted material , and then filed the incriminating porn for all to see .
Judge Adalberto Jordan was not impressed ( pdf ) .
The attached exhibit , which includes several graphic images of oral and genital sex between adult males , was filed electronically in the docket in this case , without prior permission from the court …
To the extent that the other attorney ’s alleged conduct is in any way relevant … there was no need for Mr. Thompson to file these graphic images in the public record .
A simple reference to the website and its alleged links would have sufficed …
Through his actions , Mr. Thompson made available for unlimited public viewing , on the court ’s docketing system , these graphic images .
For this reason , by October 5 , 2007 , Mr. Thompson shall show cause why this incident should not be referred to the court ’s Ad Hoc Committee on Attorney Admissions , Peer Review , and Attorney Grievance for appropriate action .
Thompson then went for the money shot .
Never one to shy away from a little mano a mano legal wrangle either , the hardened activist took the turgid thrust of history in his own two hands - he grabbed His Honor by his own gavel , and hoisted him up for all to see .
Thompson , speaking in the third person , responded thus to the rebuke :
Thompson may have more to say in his own defense as to his alleged contemptuous behavior , but at this juncture , with all respect , he does not apologize for nor regret what he has done … if this court desires to throw Thompson into jail for trying to sound the alarm in this dramatic fashion … then Thompson is prepared to go there .
Go where , again ?
Thompson is prepared to sacrifice his very liberty and experience the true meaning of hard time - all to establish our right to file pornographic photos with the court , and then submit to the stern crack of the law enforcement crop meted out thereby !
Of course , Thompson 's obsession with gay sex dates back at least as far as his lesbian - baiting face - offs with Janet Reno , and even made it into the court filings in the aforementioned ethics / sanity proceedings .
You missed the gay sex …
I ’m sure the voters are going to love that .
Go ahead , Judge .
File your bar complaint .
Make my day .
We know Thompson would n't miss the gay sex .
Explicit anal action could not be dismissed so cavalierly - clearly emboldened by his latest bit of legal swordplay , Thompson responded enthusiastically via email to GamePolitics 's coverage of the latest brouhaha :
I ’m not the one in trouble .
The judge found a certain lawyer ’s material obscene .
I absolutely love it .
This is the best thing to happen to me in a long , long time .
Check my [ case ] filings , sweetie .
To submit to a court order or blow off a federal judge ?
Always thinking big , Thompson compared ( pfd ) himself to another , more famous midnight rider .
To hold Thompson in contempt for alerting the federal court system to the criminal activity … is akin to arresting Paul Revere , in 1775 , for “ disturbing the peace ” with his midnight ride …
Whatever you say , sweetie . ®

A high - ranking British boffin has proposed that other planets might be explored by " smart dust " , clouds of tiny electronic devices which would drift intelligently on alien atmosphere currents while communicating by Wi-Fi .
John Barker , professor of electronics at the University of Glasgow , outlined his ideas at the Royal Astronomical Society 's 2007 national astronomy meeting .
The professor 's team at Glasgow has already done extensive research into smart dust and " smart specks " , and he believes that devices which could communicate and manoeuvre themselves about in mid-air can already be built .
Clouds of such tiny robots might be delivered to other worlds by automated space probes , avoiding the need for human explorers with their requirements for life support – not to mention their complex emotional baggage and possible tendency to wig out under the stress of space travel .
Core circuitry in each dust mote would be able to change the shape of its plastic casing by applying different voltages to it , so manoeuvring on the winds like a sort of miniscule droid hang - glider .
The optimum sized device for cruising the thin airs of Mars , for instance , would be approximately as big as a grain of sand .
Larger mini-machines would be required in the thicker Venusian atmosphere .
But the professor 's ambitions do n't stop at Mars and Venus .
" The same technique might also be used for exploring distant solar systems , " he writes on his website .
" The idea would be to use solar sailing variants of smart dust , " which would drift not on atmospheric winds but solar radiation ones , presumably taking centuries to reach their target stars and worlds .
Professor Barker is also involved in an attempt to build an " electronic nose " , and research into semiconductor theory .
Smart dust is clearly nanotechnology , at least in its smaller forms .
Like other nanotech , it can be associated with scary sci- fi style phrases .
" Mote swarm " , " shape - changing " , and " self - assembly " , for instance , appear on the professor 's website .
According to the BBC , he also openly used the word " mothership " , during his RAS presentation .
Nonetheless , only a truly gutter - crawling journalist would speculate that the human race might one day travel to strange new worlds – only to find that its smart - dust advance probes had evolved into a fearful hive - intelligence shapeshifting swarm , self - assembling out of control and eventually colonising the entire galaxy via solar - wind travel .
Still , Prof Barker candidly admits that : " In our simulations , we have shown that a swarm of 50 dust particles can organise themselves into a star formation , even in turbulent wind . "
It can be only a matter of time until clouds of micro-robotic dust can take human form in vampire fashion , or perhaps assemble themselves into knives or stabbing weapons , T - 1000 mimetic polyalloy style .
Cheerier buzzwords altogether are to be found at SpeckNet , home of the " smart speck " .
The scientists there describe themselves as members of the Speckled Computing consortium , which has a far matier ring to it than " mote swarm " .
Who could be irrationally afraid of a speckled computer ?
In any case , it 's early days to be beating the techno - panic gong on this one .
Professor Barker says there are many obstacles to be overcome before his dust - droids are ready to fly .
Most significantly , chemical sensor packages are still too large to fit aboard such teeny platforms .
The " electronic nose " will evidently need to be seriously miniaturised so the organised motes can smell your fear research alien atmospheres effectively . ®
Scientists have now levitated small live animals using sounds that are , well , uplifting .
In the past , researchers at Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi'an , China , used ultrasound fields to successfully levitate globs of the heaviest solid and liquid — iridium and mercury , respectively .
The aim of their work is to learn how to manufacture everything from pharmaceuticals to alloys without the aid of containers .
At times compounds are too corrosive for containers to hold , or they react with containers in other undesirable ways .
" An interesting question is , ' What will happen if a living animal is put into the acoustic field ? '
Will it also be stably levitated ? " researcher Wenjun Xie , a materials physicist at Northwestern Polytechnical University , told LiveScience .
Xie and his colleagues employed an ultrasound emitter and reflector that generated a sound pressure field between them .
The emitter produced roughly 20 - millimeter - wavelength sounds , meaning it could in theory levitate objects half that wavelength or less .
After the investigators got the ultrasound field going , they used tweezers to carefully place animals between the emitter and reflector .
The scientists found they could float ants , beetles , spiders , ladybugs , bees , tadpoles and fish up to a little more than a third of an inch long in midair .
When they levitated the fish and tadpole , the researchers added water to the ultrasound field every minute via syringe .
The levitated ant tried crawling in the air and struggled to escape by rapidly flexing its legs , although it generally failed because its feet find little purchase in the air .
The ladybug tried flying away but also failed when the field was too strong to break away from .
" We must control the levitation force carefully , because they try to fly away , " Xie said .
" An interesting moment was when my colleagues and I had to catch escaping ladybugs . "
The ant and ladybug appeared fine after 30 minutes of levitation , although the fish did not fare as well , due to the inadequate water supply , the scientists report .
" Our results may provide some methods or ideas for biology research , " Xie said .
" We have tried to hatch eggs of fish [ during ] acoustic levitation . "
The research team reported their findings online Nov. 20 in the journal Applied Physics Letters .

I never liked CVS — the limitations and design flaws become obvious almost as soon as you start using it — but after years of use it was a familiar model that worked well enough in practice .
Then came Subversion .
It worked like CVS but fixed the glaring problems , providing atomic commits , the ability to move files and folders , checksumming , revision numbers that represent whole trees , and easier tagging and branching ( albeit by shoe - horning them into the tree ) .
Switching was an easy decision .
I remained happy with it , especially with the more reliable FSFS backend and the new working copy format .
I was aware that Subversion had some problems , but none were too bothersome , and as a solo developer I knew I did n’t need a distributed version control system .
Then I heard about Git when I happened to watch a video of its creator , Linus Torvalds .
It had not occurred to me that CVS and Subversion were fundamentally broken .
Torvalds is undeniably a smart guy , but he ’s also known for his bluster .
I ’d heard Git mentioned a few times before , usually in the context of it being difficult to use , something only a kernel developer could love .
So I was skeptical but interested enough to try it out .
What I found is that Torvalds ’s bragging is justified .
Learning about Git after using other version control systems is somewhat like learning a new programming language that ’s radically different from what you ’ve known before .
Even if you might not need the more unusual features most of the time , you feel as though your eyes have been opened , your mind expanded .
Beyond just the distributed model , Git ’s implementation is beautiful .
It stores the repository in such a logical way , using far fewer files and much less disk space than Subversion .
Each file , no matter its location in the tree or history is only stored once .
The repository is stored in a single .git folder at the top level of your working directory .
In addition to its repository , Subversion needs a .svn folder inside each folder of the working directory .
The working directory holds two extra files ( one for the data and one for the properties ) for each file , plus some more file and folders for each directory .
Git needs none of these .
It ’s more efficient , and you do n’t need to make sure all your tools have special handling for the invisible .svn folders .
Git ’s implementation is compact .
It does n’t rely on a ton of other libraries , and the tar . bz2 file is only 1.1 MB .
Compiling
Git took only 15 seconds on my Mac , compared to 104 seconds for Subversion .
The user interface is currently a bit rougher than Subversion ’s , but it ’s not too bad , and some things are actually nicer .
Unfortunately , the man pages and manual do n’t build out of the box on Mac OS X , so I recommend reading them online , along with the tutorial .
In order to migrate from Subversion I needed to install LWP :
sudo perl - MCPAN -e shell install Bundle ::LWP
and a different build of Subversion that included the Perl bindings .
With /usr / local / lib / svn - perl in my PERL5LIB
I was then able to use the git - svnimport import command , but I found that this did n’t work very well , perhaps because one of my Subversion repositories did n’t use the traditional branches / tags / trunk structure .
I had much better luck with :
git - svn init - T < svn-repos > < svn-repos > git-svn fetch
So far I ’ve moved two Subversion repositories to Git .
Before I move my main development repository I want to write some shell aliases to make it a bit smoother to use , and some scripts to integrate it with BBEdit .

" Self - policing " should correct any corrupting entries
The " wiki " will allow the public to suggest the wording of a new police act , as part of a government review of the current law , written in 1958 .
Police say they hope to gain a range of views from the public on the new law before presenting it to parliament .
The wiki , one of the first of its kind in the world , is open to any internet user , police say .
' Wiki sandbox '
The wiki is the latest round of public consultation in the 18 - month review of the 50 - year - old law .
Launching a wiki version of a statute is a novel move , but one we hope will yield a range of views from people interested in having a direct say on the shape of a new Policing Act
Supt Hamish McCardle ,
New Zealand police
The officer in charge of the review , Supt Hamish McCardle , described the site as " similar to a whiteboard " and said it was open to anyone who wanted to have their say on the new law .
It even includes a " wiki sandbox " that lets nervous newcomers practise their posting .
The final document will be given to a parliamentary committee in 2008 to be considered with other information gathered during the review period .
" Launching a wiki version of a statute is a novel move , but one we hope will yield a range of views from people interested in having a direct say on the shape of a new Policing Act , " Supt McCardle said .
Aaron Smith - from the US - based Pew Internet Project , which studies the evolution of internet uses - told the BBC News website that the wiki was a new frontier in online government .
" You see a lot of government sites worldwide allowing for various feedback mechanisms ... but in terms of bringing this to the public in the form of writing laws , that 's obviously a different thing entirely and something that we certainly have n't seen yet , " Mr Smith said .
He said any possible corrupting of the process should be reduced by the " self - policing " nature of wikis .
" It would certainly be difficult for people to put in bogus information ... without people recognising that fact and the community of users correcting that before the finished product is completed , " he said .
A " wiki " - from the Hawaiian word for " quick " - is a type of website that can be easily edited by anyone .
The most well - known wiki is the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia .
Johnston has been held since 12 March
Hamas statement
A Hamas spokesman told the BBC that if Johnston was not freed , it would be the role of the Palestinian government to work for his safe release .
The reporter was abducted in March by a group calling itself The Army of Islam .
On Friday , Hamas said that Johnston should be freed and that it was in contact with his abductors .
" Alan Johnston was discussed with the kidnappers , " Mahmoud Zahhar , the former Palestinian foreign minister who is believed to be a leader of Hamas , told the BBC Arabic Service .
They have been given a deadline of today , Monday , to respond
Mahmoud Zahhar , Hamas
Timeline : Johnston missing
" They have been given a deadline of today , Monday , to respond .
They will be contacted , they may have already been contacted , for his release .
If he is not released then the role of the current government is to work for his release , safe and sound . "
In a separate interview with Reuters news agency , Mr Zahhar said : " If he is not released , we would use all means to secure his life and to free him . "
Hamas , which seized control of Gaza last week and was ousted from the Palestinian government , has said reporters should be treated as guests .
The Army of Islam has threatened to kill the BBC man if certain Islamist prisoners - in particular Palestinian - born cleric Abu Qatada , who is detained in the UK - are not released .
Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahhar says negotiations are continuing
In a video released on Sunday , Johnston 's captors denied they had reached a deal with Hamas for his imminent release but acknowledged that there had been " developments " in meetings with Hamas .
" There are developments and we will let you know when there are new developments , " a masked spokesman said .
" If they do not meet these demands there will be no release of this prisoner , but if things get worse we will get closer to God by killing this journalist . "
Johnston was the only Western reporter permanently based in Gaza , and his abduction has triggered appeals for his release from lawmakers and rights groups around the world .
Several foreigners have been seized in Gaza in recent years and all have been released unharmed , but none has been held as long as the BBC reporter .
Based on a series of secret 1999 government war simulations called The Desert Crossing games , 70 experts suggested that an occupation of Iraq would require at least 400,000 troops and even that might not be enough .
And “ Desert Crossing ” assumptions did n’t include insurgency or civil war .
For calibration purposes , at the height of the Vietnam “ War ” ( Congress did n’t declare war , so “ War ” has to go in quotes because , according to the U.S. Constitution , it is n’t a war unless congress declares it — ditto the Korean “ War ” — “ Desert Storm ” ( Iraq “ War ” I ) and the so - called present Iraq “ War ” ) , the U.S. had nearly 550,000 troops “ in country . ”
So , Bush needs at least 400,000 .
Right now , the U.S. has approximately 130,000 troops in Iraq .
Let ’s do the math : 130,000 plus 22,000 = 152,000 . 400,000 minus 152,000 = 248,000 .
So , according to the most optimistic figures , Bush will be “ only ” 248,000 troops short .
That means he ’ll have way fewer than half as many as needed .
And that ’s the rosy scenario .
There simply are n’t enough troops available any time soon — even with a draft .
Thank goodness .
And 22,000 more troops are , to be kind , irrelevant .
Why is he doing it then ?
We know someone in his Administration can add and subtract at least as well as we can .
Heck Dubya himself is a graduate of both Yale and Harvard .
Maybe they gave him a “ pass ” because he was a cheerleader ?
Naaaww .
Your mission , should you choose to accept it , is to explain Bush ’s reasoning .
Should you be caught or captured , the Secretary will disavow all knowledge – – –
P.S. How about this – – –

On Saturday , September 15th there will be a large gathering in St. Paul to protest the war , money for war , and to urge the building of bridges not bombs .
We will gather near the Cathedral of St. Paul , 239 Selby Avenue , St. Paul at 1 PM and then march to the Capitol at 1:30 .
There will be speakers at both points .
This march will coincide with the march in Washington , D.C. on the same day .
Warren Blechert with Lake Country Progressives is organizing a charter bus for those who are interested .
There will be two pick - up points :
Noon
At the parking lot at 7 and 101 , near Target Greatland in Minnetonka
12:20 or after At the Louisiana and 394 Park and Ride in Golden Valley
The bus driver will drop us off at the Cathedral and then , when we are ready to come home , we will ask him to pick us up at the Capitol .
The bus will hold 55 people ( we now have 10 reservations ) and if 50 people sign up the cost will be no more than $ 5 per person for the round trip .
If you want to reserve a spot on the bus , please e-mail Carole Rydberg at : [ email protected ] as soon as possible and I will relay this information to Warren .
If it is necessary to tweak the times a bit , those who reserve spots will be notified .
It is up to each of us to make this march a great success .

For a Man in the Middle on Iraq , Church Provides No Sanctuary
By Dana Milbank
The sign outside Accotink Unitarian Universalist Church in Burke announces that it is a “ liberal , welcoming religious community . ”
For Rep. Tom Davis yesterday , it was more liberal than welcoming .
The Virginia Republican , a possible Senate candidate who supports the Iraq war , had bravely agreed to attend a meeting of the antiwar Americans Against Escalation in Iraq .
It was a journey into the belly of the beast , and Davis got out in one piece .
Almost .
( Original Article )
A sign hangs on the back wall of a small room that serves as a fatwa center for Egyptians looking for guidance : “ Brother Citizens , the Azhar Fatwa Committee welcomes the masses of citizens and announces that fatwas are free of charge and of fees . ”
Tucked just inside the entrance of the historic Al Azhar Mosque in downtown , the center is open six days a week from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m .
It is a worn room with a soaring ceiling , tattered black couches patched up with packing tape and rickety metal kitchen chairs .
Five sheiks sit on the couches and receive people .
Sheik Abdel Aziz el - Naggar has been offering fatwas for 17 years as an employee of Al Azhar .
Like other sheiks , he rotates each month to committees that operate in each of Egypt ’s regional governates .
Over the years , he said , the vast majority of the visitors have asked for help with their marriages .
“ The greatest ill in society I observe is the lack of trust and knowledge between husband and wife , ” he said .
“ A man will think masculinity is being a dictator . ”
At 11:30 one recent morning , a young woman entered and sat in the chair opposite him .
She held her son , about 4 , on her knee as she explained that her husband had married another woman ( four wives are allowed in Islam ) and that the new wife was only 18 .
“ He said he would spend five nights with her and one with me , ” the woman complained .
“ Can I ask for a divorce ? ”
Under Islam , the sheik advised , all wives must be treated equally .
So if she could not work the matter out “ peacefully , then yes , she could ask for a divorce . ”
That was her fatwa .
A couple approached .
The man ’s clothes were tattered , and his wife looked distressed .
Their 9 - year - old son ’s clothing was clean , his hair gelled , his smile bright .
The man explained that they had adopted the child when he was 9 months old , and that they had just heard that under Islam their son had to be put out of the house , because the mother had not given birth to him or breast - fed him .

A group of East Jerusalem Palestinians has announced its intention to declare before the UN that they are formally " disengaging " from West Jerusalem and establishing an independent municipality to oversee internal affairs in their section of the city .
Demographic
Threat ?
Hamas may conquer Jerusalem within 12 years , says mayor Ronny Sofer Uri Lupolianski warns cabinet ministers that demographic shift could lead to Palestinian group gaining control of Israel ’s capital .
As government discusses 40 - year anniversary of city 's reunification , Olmert promises to invest in its development Hamas may conquer Jerusalem within 12 years , says mayor
The initiative , whether conceived as a gimmick or a genuine move , is led by an association in Jerusalem linking together over 130 Palestinian civil institutions .
The group 's leadership has said that its first move will be to send a letter to UN Secretary General Ban ki-Moon , requesting the UN realize its own decisions regarding East Jerusalem .
Representatives on behalf of the umbrella group are scheduled to make their way to the UN office in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah and deliver the letter in person .
" All UN resolutions since 1948 are based on the fact that Jerusalem is occupied territory , and that the occupation has no right to change its legal status , its geographical character or demographic makeup , and it is the right of its residents to take the necessary steps to organize and maintain their civilian lives , " writes initiative leader , Hazem al - Gharabli .
" The Israeli government has ignored these resolutions over the years and worked to alter that which characterizes this city and expel its resident from Arab Jerusalem to gain control over their lands and property .
Disengaging from West Jerusalem ?

" This without paying heed to the UN 's resolutions which called for the cessation of these practices … now the Israeli authorities are carrying out a series of racist acts , the ultimate goal of which is to bring to a complete change of the situation in the city . "
" Therefore – to stand up against this racism – the Jerusalem Association for Civil Institutions demands that the UN defend the residents of Arab Jerusalem and allow them to form a special municipality which will operate on their behalf in a manner that will serve the interests of its residents in accordance with UN resolutions .
We demand of the UN to realize the resolutions pertaining to Jerusalem and not allow the Israeli authorities to continue ignoring them . "
Elections for Palestinian municipality within 16 months
After submitting the letter to the UN , the leaders of the initiative plan to hold a press conference in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood to announce the formation of a committee designed to plan to new municipality .
" The mayor of Jerusalem has stated that he views us as a demographic threat which must be disposed of .
He can not be of service to us in this situation , " al - Gharabli told Ynet .
" We expect the UN to recognize us and send observers to help us in realizing this step . "
No connection to the PA .

Publicity stunt or not , this will be one of the events marking the 40th anniversary of the Six Day War .
According to al - Gharabli , the jurisdiction of the new municipality would follow the Green Line and it would serve all Arab residents of East Jerusalem .
The new municipality would also still stake claim to Muslim assets in West Jerusalem .
" My grandfather 's home is in the western part of Jerusalem and I have no intention of giving up on it .
The Israeli people can live in their capital in West Jerusalem – and we in the eastern part .
We 're realistic in our vision , " said al - Gharabli .
But Israel is obviously not going to recognize you .
How do you intend to serve your constituents ?
" Israel broke all the international laws .
In any case , this is our right , we demand of the international community to come aid us in managing our own affairs .
We already have clerks , garbage bags and everything we need .
We 're ordinary citizens demanding justice .
In any case , the declaration is part of a campaign we are leading under the banner of ' Life to Jerusalem . '
Who will be responsible for the preparation of the municipality ?
" We have n't decided yet .
First we 'll declare it and then appoint it .
In any case the members will be from East Jerusalem families .
We will try to get our message across through peaceful means .
Just like the Israelis live in peace , we deserve to live in peace too .
The Israelis are our neighbors and they deserve life just like us . "
Are you connected to the Palestinian Authority ?
" Absolutely not .
We have no ties to the PLO or to the Palestinian Authority , which does not support us .
On the contrary – it opposes this step .
We believe that both Israel and the Palestinian Authority discriminate against the residents of East Jerusalem . "
And you expect an answer from the secretary general of the UN ?
" Of course .
And if he does n't respond , we will intensify our actions and maybe even travel to the UN headquarters in New York and protest there .
We demand that the Security Council carry out the resolutions it passed .
Rafik Hariri ( former prime minister of Lebanon ) has only been dead since yesterday and they have already formed an international tribunal .
While Jerusalem has been suffering under occupation for 40 years and no resolutions have been carried out .
AMERICA spends more on health than any other rich country — total public and private expenditure amounted to a huge 15.3 % of GDP in 2005 , according to the OECD 's annual health report published on Wednesday July 18th .
This is well above the 30 - country OECD average of 9 % .
South Korea spends least , at 6 % .
But , higher spending wo n't necessarily mean a longer life .
It may seem like hair - splitting to quibble over a few years , but life expectancy in most other rich countries is higher than America 's 77.8 years .
For instance , Japan spends 8 % of GDP on health and has a life expectancy of 82 .

Introduction
What is an eclipse of the Moon ?
What causes eclipses and why ?
How often do eclipses happen and when is the next eclipse of the Moon ?
You 'll learn the answers to these questions and more in MrEclipse 's primer on lunar eclipses .
The Moon is a cold , rocky body about 2,160 miles ( 3,476 km ) in diameter .
It has no light of its own but shines by sunlight reflected from its surface .
The Moon orbits Earth about once every 29 and a half days .
As it circles our planet , the changing position of the Moon with respect to the Sun causes our natural satellite to cycle through a series of phases :
New Moon > New Crescent > First Quarter > Waxing Gibbous > Full Moon >
Waning Gibbous > Last Quarter >
Old Crescent > New Moon ( again )
Phases of the Moon .
The phase known as New Moon can not actually be seen because the illuminated side of the Moon is then pointed away from Earth .
The rest of the phases are familiar to all of us as the Moon cycles through them month after month .
Did you realize that the word month is derived from the Moon 's 29.5 day period ?
Many early civilizations used the Moon 's monthly cycle to measure the passage of time .
In fact , some calendars are synchronized to the phases of the Moon .
The Hebrew , Muslim and Chinese calendars are all lunar calendars .
The New Moon phase is uniquely recognized as the beginning of each calendar month just as it is the beginning on the Moon 's monthly cycle .
In comparison , the Full Moon phase occurs mid-way through the lunar month .
The Full Moon is popularly known as the phase of love and romance .
When the Moon is Full , it rises at sunset and is visible all night long .
At the end of the night , the Full Moon sets just as the Sun rises .
None of the Moon 's other phases have this unique characteristic .
It happens because the Moon is directly opposite the Sun in the sky when the Moon is Full .
Full Moon also has special significance with regard to eclipses .
Geometry of the Sun , Earth and Moon During an Eclipse of the Moon
Earth 's two shadows are the penumbra and the umbra .
( Sizes and distances not to scale )
Types of Lunar Eclipses
An eclipse of the Moon ( or lunar eclipse ) can only occur at Full Moon , and only if the Moon passes through some portion of Earth 's shadow .
That shadow is actually composed of two cone - shaped components , one nested inside the other .
The outer or penumbral shadow is a zone where the Earth blocks part but not all of the Sun 's rays from reaching the Moon .
In contrast , the inner or umbral shadow is a region where the Earth blocks all direct sunlight from reaching the Moon .
Astronomers recognize three basic types of lunar eclipses :
1. Penumbral Lunar Eclipse
The Moon passes through Earth 's penumbral shadow .
These events are of only academic interest because they are subtle and hard to observe .
( click for photo example ) 2 . Partial Lunar Eclipse A portion of the Moon passes through Earth 's umbral shadow .
These events are easy to see , even with the unaided eye .
( click for photo example ) 3 . Total Lunar Eclipse
The entire Moon passes through Earth 's umbral shadow .
These events are quite striking due to the Moon 's vibrant red color during the total phase ( totality ) .
( click for photo example )
Now you might be wondering " If the Moon orbits Earth every 29.5 days and lunar eclipses only occur at Full Moon , then why do n't we have an eclipse once a month during Full Moon ? " .
I 'm glad you asked !
You see , the Moon 's orbit around Earth is actually tipped about 5 degrees to Earth 's orbit around the Sun .
This means that the Moon spends most of the time either above or below the plane of Earth 's orbit .
And the plane of Earth 's orbit around the Sun is important because Earth 's shadows lie exactly in the same plane .
During Full Moon , our natural satellite usually passes above or below Earth 's shadows and misses them entirely .
No eclipse takes place .
But two to four times each year , the Moon passes through some portion of the Earth 's penumbral or umbral shadows and one of the above three types of eclipses occurs .
When an eclipse of the Moon takes place , everyone on the night side of Earth can see it .
About 35 % of all eclipses are of the penumbral type which are very difficult to detect , even with a telescope .
Another 30 % are partial eclipses which are easy to see with the unaided eye .
The final 35 % or so are total eclipses , and these are quite extrordinary events to behold .
What is the difference between a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse ?
A solar eclipse is an eclipse of the Sun .
It happens when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun .
This is only possible when the Moon is in the New Moon phase .
For more information , see Solar Eclipses for Beginners .

Why is the Moon Red During a Total Lunar Eclipse ?
During a total lunar eclipse , the Earth blocks the Sun 's light from reaching the Moon .
Astronauts on the Moon would then see the Earth completely eclipse the Sun .
( They would see a bright red ring around the Earth as they watched all the sunrises and sunsets happening simultaneousely around the world ! )
While the Moon remains completely within Earth 's umbral shadow , indirect sunlight still manages to reach and illuminate it .
However , this sunlight must first pass deep through the Earth 's atmosphere which filters out most of the blue colored light .
The remaining light is a deep red or orange in color and is much dimmer than pure white sunlight .
Earth 's atmosphere also bends or refracts some of this light so that a small fraction of it can reach and illuminate the Moon .
The total phase of a lunar eclipse is so interesting and beautiful precisely because of the filtering and refracting effect of Earth 's atmosphere .
If the Earth had no atmosphere , then the Moon would be completely black during a total eclipse .
Instead , the Moon can take on a range of colors from dark brown and red to bright orange and yellow .
The exact appearance depends on how much dust and clouds are present in Earth 's atmosphere .
Total eclipses tend to be very dark after major volcanic eruptions since these events dump large amounts of volcanic ash into Earth 's atmosphere .
During the total lunar eclipse of December 1992 , dust from Mount Pinatubo rendered the Moon nearly invisible .
All total eclipses start with a penumbral followed by a partial eclipse , and end with a partial followed by a penumbral eclipse ( the total eclipse is sandwiched in the middle ) .
The penumbral phases of the eclipse are quite difficult to see , even with a telescope .
However , partial and total eclipses are easy to observe , even with the naked eye .

Observing Lunar Eclipses
Unlike solar eclipses , lunar eclipses are completely safe to watch .
You do n't need any kind of protective filters .
It is n't even necessary to use a telescope .
You can watch the lunar eclipse with nothing more than your own two eyes .
If you have a pair of binoculars , they will help magnify the view and will make the red coloration brighter and easier to see .
A standard pair of 7x35 or 7x50 binoculars work fine .
Remember to dress warmly and enjoy the spectacle !
Amateur astronomers can actually make some useful observations during total eclipses .
It 's impossible to predict exactly how dark the Moon will appear during totality .
The color can also vary from dark gray or brown , through a range of shades of red and bright orange .
The color and brightness depend on the amount of dust in Earth 's atmosphere during the eclipse .
Using the Danjon Brightness Scale for lunar eclipses , amateurs can categorize the Moon 's color and brightness during totality .
Another useful amateur activity requires a telescope .
Using a standard list lunar craters , one can careful measure the exact time when each crater enters and leaves the umbral shadow .
These crater timings can be used to estimate the enlargement of Earth 's atmosphere due to airborne dust and volcanic ash .
Of course , an eclipse of the Moon also presents a tempting target to photograph .
Fortunately , lunar eclipse photography is easy provided that you have the right equipment and use it correctly .
See MrEclipse 's Picks for camera , lens and tripod recommendations .
For more photographs taken during previous lunar eclipses , be sure to visit Lunar Eclipse Photo Gallery .
Lunar Eclipse Frequency and Future Eclipses
Penumbral eclipses are of little interest because they are hard to see .
If we consider only partial and total lunar eclipses , how often do they occur ?
During the five thousand year period from 2000 BCE through 3000 CE , there are 7,718 eclipses of the Moon ( partial and total ) .
This averages out to about one and a half eclipses each year .
Actually , the number of lunar eclipses in a single year can range from 0 to 3 .
The last time that 3 total lunar eclipses occurred in one calendar year was in 1982 .
Partial eclipses slightly outnumber total eclipses by 7 to 6 .
The table below lists every lunar eclipse from 2018 through 2024 .
Click on the eclipse
Date to see a diagram of the eclipse and a world map showing where it is visible from .
Although penumbral lunar eclipses are included in this list , they are usually hard to see because they are faint .
The Umbral Magnitude is the fraction on the Moon 's diameter immersed in the umbra at maximum eclipse .
For values greater than 1.0 , it is a total eclipse .
For negative values , it is a penumbral eclipse .
The Eclipse Duration column lists the length of the partial eclipse in hours and minutes .
If it is a total eclipse , two values are given .
The first is the amount of time between the start and end of the partial phases while the second ( in bold ) is the length of the total eclipse .

— SPECIAL REPORT —
Air Force refused to fly weapons to Middle East theater
By Wayne Madsen
Author ’s website : www.waynemadsenreport.com
WMR has learned from U.S. and foreign intelligence sources that the B - 52 transporting six stealth AGM - 129 Advanced Cruise Missiles , each armed with a W - 80 - 1 nuclear warhead , on August 30 , were destined for the Middle East via Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana .
However , elements of the Air Force , supported by U.S. intelligence agency personnel , successfully revealed the ultimate destination of the nuclear weapons and the mission was aborted due to internal opposition within the Air Force and U.S. Intelligence Community .
Yesterday , the Washington Post attempted to explain away the fact that America ’s nuclear command and control system broke down in an unprecedented manner by reporting that it was the result of “ security failures at multiple levels . ”
It is now apparent that the command and control breakdown , reported as a BENT SPEAR incident to the Secretary of Defense and White House , was not the result of a command and control chain - of - command “ failures ” but the result of a revolt and push back by various echelons within the Air Force and intelligence agencies against a planned U.S. attack on Iran using nuclear and conventional
weapons .
( Original Article )
Arsene Wenger spoke to France Football magazine last week about his misgivings over the departure from Arsenal of David Dein and Thierry Henry , took a dig at Chelsea in emphasising the importance of ' growing ' a team rather than buying one , and assessed the health and ailments of English football - a game that is , in Wenger 's view , 'at a crossroads ' .
Here we give British readers the first chance to read in full Wenger 's frank and wide - ranging interview
Were you ever tempted to leave Arsenal when you found out your friend David Dein was leaving the board ?
Did you have doubts about staying ?
I had my doubts , yes , at certain moments .
You always have this type of thought when you come to the end of your contract .
But where would I go ?
I mean , I 've never entered into discussions with other clubs .
David Dein leaving was something that was very difficult to accept at first , but as I 've always said , I have a responsibility to a very young team , to players who I 've brought here .
I also have a responsibility in regard to the supporters and to the club who have always trusted me , away from the internal differences that there have been at the club .
They 've always had faith in me , letting me work how I want .
It was a very difficult situation , which put me between David and the club a little bit .
But even David is still , above all , an Arsenal fan .
And he has always encouraged me to stay at the club .
Was n't allowing
Henry to go to Barcelona , paradoxically , a sign that you wanted to stay for the long term ?
A paradox ?
No .
Thierry was coming up to 30 years old [ born 18 Aug , 1977 ] ; he knew we were moving forward with a young team .
He was n't exactly sure of my plans about staying .
He had come to a stage , where , as a forward he did n't have much time left .
I understand that completely .
He said to me : ' Coach , it 's true we have a good team , it 's also true we have a young team .
It will become very strong , for sure , but me , I do n't have the time to wait .
Will it be strong next season , or the one after that ?
I do n't know - but me , now , I 've faced up to this decision .
And I said to him : ' But Thierry , I understand your problem completely .
I think the team will be very strong , very soon but I understand why you ask the question . '
So , he told me : ' I want to leave , ' and that 's why he left .
With hindsight , it 's true that David leaving had a bearing on Thierry 's decision , made it easier in some way .
Thierry 's injuries also contributed to his leaving .
He was less involved with the team and then , after a few games , you had to say , no , we are not going to win the league .
The strength of a team depends on self - belief and once we were out of the title race , we lost our belief .
I mean the belief the players have in themselves .
Maybe , at a certain stage , Thierry thought the belief had gone .
You said recently that you could n't really remember the teams you had managed before Arsenal .
Was that a joke ?
Oh no .
I 've had 10 intense years here [ he looks for the right word but can't find it ] ...
This is something I will not experience anywhere else .
You know , every morning , every day there are so many things to get on with here .
You have to get involved down to the last detail if you want to endure in the game , because there is such intensity around football in England .
And you get so involved you end up forgetting where you 've been before .
If you stay until the end of your contract , in 2011 , you will have beaten the record held by George Allison [ Arsenal manager 1934 - 47 ] , for staying as manager at the club .
Do you cast your eyes forward into the future and dream of the place you will have in Arsenal 's history , alongside legends like Herbert Chapman ?
No , not really .
I look forward into the future , but not like this .
I try to do the best I can , so that people will remember me fondly .
I think yes , that I will have contributed to the history of the club , and it makes me extremely proud that people compare me to Chapman now , for he was an exceptional person and gave Arsenal such impetus .
If you look at what he did in the context of that time , you would say it was out of this world .
Unbelievable .
But how do you explain such longevity ?
In top - level European football , there are only two managers who have been in their job for 10 years - Sir Alex Ferguson and you .
Is there a secret ?
I do n't know .
I 've had tremendous luck .
I spent seven years at Monaco and now 11 here .
I had the good fortune to find good people here , people I 've trusted .
Do you believe in destiny ?
Yes .
For me , success in life is a happy turn of events that you make with your own attitude .
The club have just announced remarkable financial results .
You are now the second - richest club in the world behind Real Madrid .
Has the bet on the Emirates completely paid off ?
Yes , without any doubt .
The figures demonstrate that .
We have entered another dimension .
And when the debts are paid ...
When exactly ?
Between 20 and 23 years ' time ... but I believe that we will see the difference after the end of the 2008 - 09 season .
We will have much greater resources at our disposal .
My priority will be to keep the players I already have .
Above all I believe in the virtues of a collective ethos and I believe that you can only maintain that and develop that if you have a culture to impart ; a culture that you can pass from generation to generation .
And these generations of players must be imbued with that culture to be able to pass it on .
If the clubs only become a place to go to and a place to leave , then the club wo n't go very far .
The love for our game must be passed on .
I will stick to that policy strictly - but if , one day , there is a player who can take us up a level , and who costs a fortune , we can still buy him .
So continuity remains the order of the day ?
Always .
It 's not an accident that one of your former clubs , Nancy , is leading the French league , having the smallest turnover of players over the past three seasons .
[ Visibly very interested ]
Well , that 's a real lesson .
There is such a thirst in this society for new things , that there is the tendency to throw things away because you want something else .
You forget the magic of team sport stems also from the development of a group of players who come together for a certain length of time .
For example , take this young Arsenal team ...
It has matured together .
Which also means it has suffered together ; it 's important to share the pain .
Think of the disappointments of last year and , in spite of all that , I felt they turned the corner .
When we 've been knocked back - walked into a head - wind , so to speak - we 've never given up , we 've always fought on .
And I told myself , hang on , there is something growing here , a mental force that will astonish everyone even more when things are going well .
And you are staying to see where this strength will lead ?
Yes .
At the end of the 1990s , faced with the inflation of transfer fees and salaries , you said English football was about to hit the wall .
All transfer records have been beaten this summer ; does this mean that crash has come and gone ?
Money itself is not guilty ; it 's what the people do with it that can be bad .
If the aim is to improve things while the players earn even more money , then that 's fine .
But if that sends us into an inflationary spiral which leads to debts and clubs collapsing , then that 's a catastrophe .
There are three factors in play ... the wealth of the clubs themselves , the wealth produced by television and the wealth of the owner .
And does n't that bother you ?
What bothers me is when a club lives beyond its means .
In some places you are seeing a return to financial trickery .
A European law would not be a bad idea at all .
But it would be much better if the people in charge of clubs were sensible enough so you did n't need to make laws .
You end up creating organisations that control those who have to be controlled , which results in a bureaucratic society preventing any creativity .
And that 's not a solution either .
But are n't you worried when you see more and more clubs in the Premier League becoming the target of foreign investors who want an immediate return on their investment ?
The real danger these days is the people who buy big clubs and re-finance their acquisition by borrowing money from banks and putting the debt on the club 's books .
That 's what the Glazers have done at Manchester United .
Yes , more or less : Man United generate so much income that they can get away with it , but their example , reproduced on a smaller scale , could be fatal .
That is the biggest danger which is threatening English football today .
But is n't there a danger which threatens all of European football , namely the creation of a football world with two gears , with the English and several big clubs able to negotiate their TV rights for themselves , and everyone else left behind .
Yes , but I believe that is inevitable .
You have to remember that the football world has always had several gears .
Do you remember the time when English players went to France because they were n't getting paid as well here as over there , thanks to [ TV channel ] Canal Plus .
And who complained about that in France at the time ?
No one .
Right now , Romanians and Bulgarians can talk about a world of football with two gears if they compare their leagues to France 's top division .
Unless you decide tomorrow to create 53 European countries that have exactly the same population and resources , that will always exist .
But there is some money which has arrived in English football whose origins ...
[ He cuts in ]
That is indefensible .
But unfortunately that also exists in the public sector and in banks .
One gets the feeling you are very attached to the moral dimension of football , including the way it is played .
Yes , and it's one of the things I 'm most proud of .
Arsenal has a tradition that I like to respect , but Arsenal also has moral qualities for which I feel responsible and which I defend in my team .
Everyone has their values that they pass down to the generations that follow .
That 's why , when there was the Ashley Cole affair , I wanted someone at Chelsea to explain what their values were .
I understand completely that they wanted to nick a player because he is one of the best .
But what are their values ?
Do you feel that English football is in the process of losing its soul ?
A little , yes .
Because the scale of things has changed .
We 've gone from owner - supporter to owner - businessman .
Where the danger was n't there before , it might be present today .
But , that said , you can't condemn people just like that .
You can have businessmen who respect perfectly English football 's values .
But in this regard , I can understand why there is worry now when it did not exist before .
You used to have a boy who went and stood watching at games , who became a Liverpool fan and who after having succeeded in life , had a dream of buying ' his ' club .
Things have changed a lot since then .
But if Dr Wenger had to give a diagnosis of English football , what would it be ?
English football is in extraordinary health .
And I believe it has preserved its spirit - up to now - while improving its quality .
It is now the football that is the most - watched and best - loved in the whole world .
And now it finds itself handed an even greater responsibility : how to continue improving the quality without losing its soul .
It 's the challenge which we face today and it requires an enormous amount of vigilance .
And who has to be vigilant ?
The fans ?
Of course .
They are the guardians of football .
They either come to matches or they do n't and their verdict is usually right .
They understand the game .
I find it so fascinating that English football has realised how to keep progressing , and kept its uncalculated way of playing and kept the enthusiasm of its supporters , but still I think we have reached a crucial moment .
The first signs of the game being over - exposed are being felt .
The grounds are less full , there is saturation coverage on TV .
There is a limit as to how much people can eat and digest , as much in terms of what they will pay as what they will watch .
Trevor Brooking ...
[ Wenger interrupts : ' Whose intelligence and analysis I regard highly ' ] is worried about another aspect of English football at club level ; only 37 per cent of players were English , among those who played the first day of this season .
[ Very animated ]
That 's really where we 've arrived at a crossroads .
Should the Premier League only try and improve its standard as much as possible to remain the best championship in the world or does it have a responsibility to produce players for the English national team ?
That is the real debate .
And where do you stand in this debate ?
Me , I 'm not part of this debate at all .
I 'm not a great fan of national teams .
If Europe does something about foreign players , it would be to the detriment of national teams .
Now Uefa is in a position where it is obliged to protect the national teams , seeing how big the audiences are on TV .
But what interests the football fanatic in me [ smiles ] is whether the game gets better and better .
But that does not explain the reduction in the number of English players every season , especially in the big clubs ?
Are they not good enough or are they too expensive ?
I think it 's a fundamental problem of quality .
But why are n't there good players from England ?
Someone has to do something .
It 's not normal that a kid coming from South Africa or Brazil is better than those here .
It 's what I 'm trying to do with the academy at Arsenal ... and it's that area that Brooking has analysed fairly and objectively : he says let 's bring up some English kids who are as good as those who come from abroad .
Those young English players will be of a good enough quality as soon as I go and see the French under - 17s and I say to myself , no I 'm not going to take that player there , because I have an English boy who is under 17 and as good as him .
But one of the beautiful things in sport is being able to say : ' Why should n't a kid who is passionate and talented - and born in Zimbabwe - have the chance to play with the best footballers in the world ? '
It would be an injustice .
So morals still come into it ?
Morals always come into it .
The Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine , or CECE , is a liquid oxygen - hydrogen pump - fed engine developed to demonstrate advanced rocket technologies for future space vehicles .
( Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne )
A liquid oxygen - hydrogen pump fed engine developed to demonstrate advanced rocket technologies for future space vehicles achieved a major technical milestone in throttling capability .
The engine was designed to demonstrate successful throttling from full power down to 10 percent of its thrust .
This flexibility to control the flow of fuel through an engine is necessary for a lunar lander , allowing the spacecraft ample propulsion , yet enough control to land gently on the moon ’s surface .
The Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine , CECE for short , was built off the design of the Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne RL10 engine which has a proven history of performance .
CECE is fueled by a mixture of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen and generates 13,800 pounds of thrust .
Cryogenic means " ice cold " in Greek , referring to the extremely low temperatures needed to keep the hydrogen and oxygen in a liquid phase .
Using liquid hydrogen and oxygen in rockets will provide major advantages for landing astronauts on the moon .
Hydrogen is very light but has about 40 percent more performance ( force on the rocket per pound of propellant ) than other rocket fuels , enabling lower vehicle mass and a larger payload than with the same amount of conventional propellants .
" This technology has the potential to be the backbone of a deep - throttling , reliable , reusable engine for use across most human and robotic missions , " said Tony Kim , NASA ’s Deep Throttling Engine Project Manager .
" Through two rounds of testing , the CECE team has accomplished quite a bit , but we still have a long way to go before this technology will be ready for full scale development . "
Engineers have added throttling ability by using a bypass valve to direct hydrogen around the turbopump that drives propellant into the combustion chamber .
Through two rounds of hot - fire testing , the CECE team has demonstrated throttling operability to 9.5 percent power , but operation with stable combustion to 20 percent power , or a 5 - to - 1 throttling ratio .
Engine performance data collected during 2098 seconds of hot run time will be analyzed to support future development decisions .
Looking forward , the team will push CECE to lower throttle levels .
Currently , at lower throttle levels , oxygen vapor forms on the inner injector plate and causes the oxygen flow to fluctuate .
This triggers pressure oscillations in the engine called " chugging . "
Chugging may not be a problem for the engine itself , but the vibrations it causes has the potential to resonate with the structure of the rocket and could cause damage .
The next tests will determine whether , with modifications to the injector and valves , CECE can demonstrate stable combustion down to 10 percent power , a 10 - to - 1 throttle ratio .
The CECE collaboration includes engineers from Marshall Space Flight Center and Glenn Research Center joined with Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne .
The CECE effort is part of the Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development ( PCAD ) project at Glenn , which is developing cryogenic propulsion and propellant management systems for the Lunar Lander .
The PCAD project is funded by the Exploration Technology Development Program in NASA 's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate .
NASA has invested in CECE technology since 2005 .
The aim is to achieve a more reliable , robust and less expensive rocket engine ready in 2018 for America ’s next moon landing .
" This CECE testing has moved us another step closer in providing risk mitigation for designing and building a future lunar lander , " said Mark Klem , NASA 's PCAD Project Manager .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
It used to be called the common cold .
Now scientists are starting to put some not - so - common names to the hundreds of viruses that make people cough , sneeze , wheeze and worse .
A reporter sits in front a projected image showing virus infected cells inspected under a microscope during a news conference in Hong Kong , March 27 , 2003 .
This week they described how new research techniques are uncovering a host of new respiratory viruses -- including a new , monster - sized virus -- and spurring efforts to better understand the role of these viruses in disease .

This week they described how new research techniques are uncovering a host of new respiratory viruses -- including a new , monster - sized virus -- and spurring efforts to better understand the role of these viruses in disease .
“ We ’ve added a bunch of viruses , some of which we have never heard of before , ” said Kenneth McIntosh of Harvard Medical School , speaking at a microbiology meeting in Chicago .
Many of these newly named viruses have been causing coughs and runny noses for hundreds of years , alongside better - known viruses such as rhinoviruses and adenoviruses .
But scientists have only recently had the molecular research tools to identify these bugs , McIntosh said .
“ We know they are there ... but we do n’t know what we really need to know about their capacity to produce disease , ” he said .
That information may prove to be important as cold viruses are the main culprit behind 50 percent to 80 percent of asthma attacks .
“ In children , up to 80 percent of the time when you have a bad asthma attack , it ’s because you ’ve got one of these wimpy cold viruses , ” said Dr. Jim Gern of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health .
“ With the advent of new tests that are based on genetic material , we ’re finding there ’s a lot more out there that we were not able to detect before , ” he said in a telephone interview .
SARS CATALYST
Some of the research activity was spurred by the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS , which spread from China to 30 countries in 2003 , infecting close to 8,000 people and killing nearly 800 before it was contained .
“ After SARS turned out to be a coronavirus , that energized the coronavirus field , so we ’ve added two new coronaviruses , ” McIntosh said .
Another new virus is the human bocavirus , a close cousin to the bovine parvovirus and the canine minute virus , which cause diarrhea in cattle and dogs .
“ Now it is being found in acute respiratory disease in children , ” McIntosh said .
The other puzzling virus is the mimivirus , first discovered growing inside an amoeba in 1992 but which evaded identification until 2003 because of its enormous size and complex characteristics .
Three times bigger than other viruses , the mimivirus was found in the DNA of patients with pneumonia , and may account for some of the 20 to 50 percent of pneumonia cases that previously went unidentified .
Last May , David Wang of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis discovered the WU virus , a new type of polyoma virus that may be causing respiratory infections and perhaps other problems .
“ One of the things we are looking at is does our virus have the ability to create tumors , ” Wang said .
Gern , who wrote about the new molecular sleuthing techniques in the September 15 Journal of Infectious Diseases , said his group and others are focusing on why cold viruses make some people very sick and not others .
That may lead to therapies that strengthen the immune system .
“ I think the most promise lies in the area of finding immune responses that seem to be protective against these illnesses , ” Gern said .
Yes , there is an official ring to LuckyPatchers.com but that is n’t the official site of the app ’s makers .
Instead , you ’ll find new releases at lucky - patcher.netbew.com .
To be fair , both the official site and the assumed official site both carry the latest version of the app : 7.2.9 .
That said , now you know that you should be looking at another site for the latest release .
Being able to download and install apps not originating from the Google Play Store is one of the best features of an Android system .
Users can simply go to trusted sources – official websites or big Android blogs – to download APKs .
APKs function like EXEs , which will be familiar to Windows users .
It ’s basically an installer that you download in order to get the app running on your device .
Usually , you go to the Play Store to find an app you ’d like to install .
With an APK , it seems like you ’re doing things manually .
When it comes to updates , it ’s always best to head to the source – in this case , the makers – for the latest release .
In the case of Lucky Patcher , the latest versions of the app are published at lucky - patcher.netbew.com .
If you dislike the notion of frequently checking the site for news , there ’s social media to turn to .
There ’s a Lucky Patcher Facebook account that you can follow to keep up - to - date on new releases .
As of this writing , the current version stands at 7.2.9 .
To sum it all : you have to go to lucky - patcher .
netbew.com or the Lucky Patcher Facebook page for the latest updates .
Why is Lucky Patcher Not Available in the Play Store
Lucky Patcher is available as an APK .
That means it ca n’t be found on the Play Store .
There are many reasons an app ca n’t be found in that marketplace , including device incompatibility and region restrictions .
However , there are cases when apps are deliberately not on the Play Store .
In the case of Lucky Patcher , it ’s not there because of what it does .
Lucky Patcher removes ads , modifies app permissions , and bypasses license verification of premium applications – just to name a few .
As you can see , these are things that most app makers do n’t want but Lucky Patcher allows you to do them anyhow .
In reality , installing an APK from sources other than big names brings with it certain risks .
You certainly do n’t want to end up with a bricked phone , but sometimes you want certain freedoms when it comes to apps .
And it ’s a good thing that there are certain people who are willing to cater to that need .
Lucky Patcher Requirements
Given what Lucky Patcher can do , it requires that your mobile device be rooted .
It ’s the equivalent of “ jailbreaking ” in iOS .
Meaning , restrictions are stripped off so you can do whatever you want to your phone .
Lucky Patcher is currently at version 7.2.9 and includes changes to the ads SDK , translation updates , and some bug fixes .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. diplomat accused of having said “ the only good Arab is a dead Arab ” in a voice mail left with an Arab - American group has retired from the government , the State Department said on Thursday .
The diplomat , Patrick Syring , was accused of having made abusive , intimidating and racist comments in e-mails and voice mails to employees of the Arab American Institute , a Washington group that promotes Arab - American interests .
The State Department declined comment on the legal case against Syring , which was outlined in an indictment filed at a U.S. federal court on Wednesday , but said the diplomat had decided to retire .
Syring is alleged to have made the comments in a series of e-mails and voice mails to officials the Arab American Institute , including its president James Zogby , when Israel was at war with Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas in July 2006 .
“ The only good Lebanese is a dead Lebanese .
The only good Arab is a dead Arab .
Long live the IDF .
Death to Lebanon and death to the Arabs , ” Syring said in a voice mail recorded at the institute on July 17 , 2006 .
IDF stands for Israel Defense Forces -- the Israeli military .
“ Fuck the Arabs and Fuck James Zogby and his wicked Hizbollah brothers .
They will burn in hellfire on this earth and in the hereafter , ” he wrote in an e-mail to Zogby and another institute employee on the same day .
The voice mails and e-mails , which were sent from a personal e-mail address , were quoted in the indictment .
Syring served as a U.S. diplomat in the Middle East and most recently worked in Human Resources at the State Department .
He stands accused of violating U.S. law on federally protected rights and of making threatening communications .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack declined to address the Syring case specifically other than to say he had retired .
U.S. officials declined to comment on whether he had decided to retire before or after having allegedly made the remarks .
Speaking generally , McCormack said such comments were unacceptable to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
“ Let me just underline for you the seriousness with which the secretary approaches the idea that the State Department should be a workplace that in no way , shape or form tolerates discrimination or hateful language , ” he said .
“ It ’s just not condoned or acceptable in this department . ”
Calls to Syring ’s home in Virginia were not returned .
The world you see around you appears perfectly stationary , even though your eyes dart back and forth two to three times every second in little hops called saccades .
For more than a century researchers have assumed that the brain must keep track of the impulses that cause these tiny motions , so as to subtract their effect from our visual awareness .
Now researchers have identified a circuit in the monkey brain that seems to play this role .
Ignoring the motion of our eyes allows us to focus on changes in our environment .
The alternative would be chaos , says brain researcher Robert Wurtz of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md. " It 's almost as if you have a movie camera on top of a bronco and it 's jumping around , " Wurtz says .
" If you watched the movie it would make you sick . "
Researchers believe the brain solves this problem through a process called corollary discharge .
Every time the brain sends the eyes a signal to twitch , it sends a copy , or corollary signal , to another location in the brain , sort of like the way your e-mail client sends copies of your e-mails to their own folder , Wurtz explains .
Wurtz and his colleague Marc Sommer , now at the University of Pittsburgh , stumbled onto the presumed corollary discharge pathway while stimulating the brain region that controls eye movements in live monkeys .
Sommer noted that a current applied to this area , called the superior colliculus , elicited a delayed response in the frontal cortex , which is associated with attention and decision making , Wurtz recalls .
The delay suggested a relay of neurons ending at the frontal cortex .
Researchers had already observed that brain cells in this region seem to anticipate where the eye 's center of focus will move to after an impending saccade , making it a reasonable place for corollary discharges to end up .
By probing the animals ' brains with electrodes , Wurtz and Sommer discovered that the signals from the superior colliculus to the frontal cortex passed through a portion of the thalamus .
" That really gives us a switch we can turn on and off , " Wurtz says .
To see if the thalamus is the source of corollary discharges , they injected a small part of it with a compound that blocks neuron firing .
As would be expected for the corollary pathway , the frontal cortex of the injected monkeys consistently displayed less of the saccade - anticipating activity , the group reports in a paper published online November 8 in Nature .
Other experts find the result convincing .
" For a long time we 've known that mechanism had to be there , and they 've shown how it works , " says neurophysiologist Douglas Munoz of Queens University in Ontario .
Besides solving this puzzle , adds James Lynch of the University of Mississippi , the group 's " imaginative and exceedingly difficult " experiments also mark a new step in the ability to pinpoint the flow of information in the brain .
Sommer says future experiments may inactivate more of the thalamus to see if monkeys have a harder time distinguishing their own saccades from changes in their environment .
Dissident Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov , father of the Soviet H- bomb . *
Photo : Corbis * 1953 : The Cold War shifts into overdrive with the public acknowledgement by the Soviet Union that it has successfully tested its first hydrogen bomb .
The detonation , which occurred Aug. 12 at the Semipalatinsk test site on the Kazakhstan steppe , allowed the Soviets to draw even in the arms race again .
The United States had detonated its first hydrogen bomb the previous November out in the Pacific atolls .
Physicist Andrei Sakharov , who would eventually become one of the USSR 's most famous dissidents , was one of the chief designers of its hydrogen bomb .
That weapon carried the explosive power of 400 kilotons of TNT , making it roughly 26 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped by the Americans on Hiroshima eight years earlier .
Thus began a long rivalry of bomb - test one - upmanship between the world 's two superpowers , dragging on through the 1950s into the '60s .
The Soviets , especially , developed a fondness for the hydrogen bomb and tested increasingly powerful versions .
The tests culminated in 1961 with the dropping of the so - called Tsar bomb , packing a 60 - megaton wallop , making it the most powerful thermonuclear device ever detonated .
There were repercussions far from the testing grounds , too , as both sides became more and more fearful and paranoid of the other .
In the United States , within days of the initial Soviet H- bomb announcement , President Eisenhower stripped J. Robert Oppenheimer of his security clearances , believing that the father of the U.S. atomic bomb harbored communist sympathies .
Ike also sacked a few thousand government employees who seemed a little too pink for his liking .

Why relief for Northern Rock savers could cost us all dear
Last night Alastair Darling , the UK Chancellor , guaranteed 100 % of savings in Northern Rock – and indeed the Financial Services Authority has since gone further , stating this guarantee extends to other troubled financial institutions that might emerge in coming days .
Given the scenes we ’ve witnessed since Thursday ’s news that Northern Rock required a lifeline from the Bank of England , many will think it ’s a good move .
And sure , the decision will probably quieten the recent financial upheavals .
It will certainly get the government off the hook for now ( and to be clear , I do n’t believe the government was responsible for the problems in the first place ) .
But it is without precedent in the UK , and has potentially serious consequences that sound academic but which in extreme cases have previously led to unpleasant upheavals of the blood and barricades variety .
What ’s worse , the guarantee has for now come without any balancing regulation to ensure the banks do not abuse the facility for their own ends .
At the very least then , a move designed to bring short term confidence to the UK banking system will prove embarrassing for years to come , with consequences for all of us in Britain who save , borrow and spend .
Everyone , in other words .
Why ?
First , some scene setting .
Yesterday I went to see the queues outside Northern Rock .
Not to gloat in people ’s misfortune , you understand .
The opposite : I wanted a reminder forever of the consequences of financial panic .
And I wanted to be able to tell my grandchildren I ’d seen a run on a bank – naturally hoping that such a worrying turn of events will never be repeated in my lifetime .
It was a very orderly queue , almost jolly , with stools and chit chat amongst the Northern Rock customers .
The branch I was able to visit was near Mayfair ; I was witnessing the “ I ’d like to withdraw the full £ 100,000 , please ” crowd .
As I ’ve written previously , I believe the customers were quite rational to want to take their money out , because , as I said then , why risk leaving it in ?
In the same article though , I said I expected the government would eventually refund any and all depositors losses , even though the official FSA compensation scheme only protects the first £ 2,000 and 90 % of the next £ 33,000 .
If I expected full refunds in the event they were required , why am I surprised and dismayed that the Chancellor has now announced that he will do so in advance ?
Because he has now guaranteed that whatever bad decisions UK banks make in the foreseeable future , savers will be safe .
An extreme view would be that he has ( temporarily , we must hope ) semi-nationalised the UK banking system .
With the Bank of England standing behind them to make good savers losses , yet exerting no control over their investments , what is to encourage banks to be prudent ?
Why should n’t they now go out and recklessly lend to whoever they fancy , however bad the credit risk ?
In the absence of balancing regulation , the only justifiable answer is that the Bank of England ’s emergency penal rate ( which we ’ve not yet been told ) is so high that profits will be damaged and shareholders will suffer if it ’s used – so even if savers face no risk , banks wo n’t want to be too cavalier with their investments for fear of calling on the bail out , making losses , and then being punished by the stock market .
It ’s a reason , certainly , but I believe a convoluted one , especially since it ’s currently near impossible for investors to judge the risks and rewards of owning a bank , given that we do n’t know :
The penal rate the Bank of England is charging Northern Rock and others
How long it will extend these guarantees
What rules it might change tomorrow if politically expedient ( at least until we get more clarification on the above two points )
Why you should care
Yawn yawn , you might now be thinking .
Yet these rather esoteric - sounding events over the past 24 hours dramatically challenge the central tenants of our financial system .
Remember , there ’s no gold in the vaults of the Bank of England to back up every £ 1 in circulation , and there has n’t been for many decades .
Rather , our system is based on us all agreeing to trust that a £ 20 note is , literally , worth £ 20 more than the paper it ’s written on .
This has enormous benefits compared with lugging gold bars about the country – let alone having to barter for a coffee at Starbucks with half a dozen fresh eggs – but it only works if we all understand and follow the rules .
Collectively , we – individuals , institutions , companies and investors – have reached agreement about how corporate bonds , government bonds , equities and central bank interest rates work , the risks and rewards of each , and how they interact with each other .
For instance :
We accept shares will go up and down over the short - term , because we believe there ’s a good probability of long term gain .
Another example : if we buy a fixed rate interest investment like a bond , we do so knowing that sometimes it will pay less than variable interest rate savings in a bank , and sometimes more .
That ’s the trade - off for the security of the fixed income .
I ’m not saying this system is always entirely orderly .
We generally accept that moments of irrationality or extreme events will upset the pricing of those assets , such as the ERM failure that threw the UK into recession in the early 1990s .
But equally , we usually leave the markets to sort out the results , because the alternatives are worse .
So , before Darling ’s announcement , if you wanted absolute guarantees about your capital , you bought gilts if you were , say , a pension fund , or put your money in a slightly lower interest paying National Savings if you were you or me .
Anyone who bought gilts or chose National Savings did so for that reason .
But by giving its full backing to Northern Rock and any other institution that looks vulnerable – not even the particularly good institutions , but rather , the specifically ‘ gone bad ’ ones !
– the government has at a stroke done away with the distinction between buying low - paying gilts backed by the Treasury , and any high street bank following an unsustainable business model in order to win market share .
How can that be sensible ?
For political ends , of course , but that ’s at the heart of the concern .
The history of governments directly intervening to change the fundamental running of capital markets for political reasons has a terrible history involving , in the very worst cases , revolutions , dictators , and hyperinflation .
To be clear , I ’m not some frothing blogger who expects to be mounting the barricades of Threadneedle Street by next Tuesday .
I ’m simply pointing out why something that seems perfectly sensible – protecting savers – has potentially wide - reaching ramifications .
Monevator.com is about saving and investing , not overspending and living in debt , and naturally I have enormous sympathy for pensioners who were worried they were going to lose their savings at Northern Rock .
Indeed , given to where we ’d got to , the government possibly had to do something – say extending the 90 per cent guarantee to cover savings above £ 35,000 .
But however difficult it might have been over the weeks and months ahead , there must be some risk in a market economy .
Otherwise the market cannot decide between asset A and asset B , pricing and risk / reward goes out of the window , and we ’ll face the cost in years to come .
Confidence in a banking system means more than , “ Will I get my money back ? ”
We also need complete confidence that the system behind our money is more than smoke , mirrors and strings .
A sudden decision to guarantee all UK savings – whatever the cost and however they were threatened – seriously undermines that credibility .
Things would have gotten worse before they ’d gotten better if the market had been left to its own devices , make no mistake .
But the government and the Bank of England should have toughed it out .
If politicians wanted to get more involved in addressing the instabilities caused by a decade of debt then they should have been done cautiously , soberly , and long before the stuff hit the fan .
Update :
It ’s become clear ( - ish ) over the course of the day that the 100 % compensation promised by Alistair Darling only applies to existing savings accounts .
While this reduces the problem of devaluing government bonds ( gilts ) by giving new Northern Rock savings accounts the same AAA protection , it hardly obviates the wider impact of such meddling .
Indeed , we now have a situation where if I open a savings account with a troubled institution tomorrow I ’ll not receive 100 % backing from the government , but if I opened one yesterday I will – despite it being exactly the same account !

Another fantastic performance by the SF Ballet .
I know you enjoyed it .
Our whole section knows you enjoyed it .
Every time a dancer would perform a particularly impressive jump , or a series of 3 + pirouettes , you would say , " Whoa ! " or " Jaysus !
" This , I did n't mind .
As a former dancer and now a season - ticket holder of our City 's fine company , I get a kick out of hearing others ' excitement for an artform I hold dear .
Much better than the guy next to me whose head started to fall like a kid in an 8th grade math class .
So , the curtain falls .
The end .
Applause .
Curtain comes up and the dancers begin to take their bows .
You notice a few people standing up .
Was it an ovation ?
NO !
They were LEAVING !
These people could not WAIT to get to their cars ( they were obviously not MUNI riders , walkers or cab - hailers like most of us in the City ) !
They had no time for CLAPPING !
They had to get out now !
It was then you yelled , in your beautiful gray - haired old crotchety man voice , " WILL YOU PEOPLE SIT DOWN AND LET THE * POLITE * PEOPLE SHOW THEIR APPRECIATION ?! , " slight pause , " YA ASSHOLES !
" Now , I have seen dozens of ballets in my relatively short lifetime of 25 years .
Never , not once , have I encountered a fan of ballet quite like you .
At the ballgame , sure , that kind of yelling is par for the course .
At the ballgame we eat peanuts and leave the shells in piles at our feet .
Sir , this was THE BALLET .
And for your outburst directed at the people who think somewhere in their tiny brains that it is even remotely acceptable to get up and leave during the curtain call , remotely acceptable to not even clap for the world class artists who just performed a most difficult and worthwhile ballet for our enjoyment ( artists whose salary is about that of a standard office receptionist ) , remotely acceptable to WALK OUT while the house lights are up and we can all ( including the dancers ) see ... Kind sir , for your outburst , screaming at these " assholes " , I thank you from the bottom of my art - loving heart .
I 've been wanting to say that for a long time .
And WOW !
They sat their asses down , did n't they ?!
A few were even clapping .
You are the BEST .

‘ Lucidtouch ’ technology ( as they call ) has been unveiled by MS in collaboration with Mitsubishi , this technology enables the user to input data into the device by touching either sides of the screen .
The major difference between LucidTouch and MultiTouch technologies is that the user can manipulate the data on the screen by touching either sides in the former and only one side in the latter .
A small camera hanging on the back of this device helps in analyzing the position of your hands and creating an illusion as if the Screen is Transparent .
I Hope This Technology will boost UMPC ( ultra mobile Pc ) handhelds ability to handle the data to a larger extent .
Acc to engadget
Microsoft , a company that ’s been increasingly active in the world of interface research and development , has been dipping its toes further into the multi - touch pool with one of its latest projects : the LucidTouch .
The new interface , developed in collaboration with Mitsubishi , adds double - sided touch to a 7 - inch , handheld , Surface - esque panel ( mysteriously similar to an Apple patent which we saw recently ) .
The new system reveals placement of a user ’s hands behind the touch surface through the use of a mounted camera — though future iterations would use surface - based sensors to show the digits — and a touch pad mounted to the back allows interaction with on - screen objects .
In addition to the panel itself , the designers have implemented “ assistant ” UI components that help ease use of the unique hand location , including a dragging system which allows you to “ pass off ” an object from one finger to another , and a customized keyboard layout that permits touch - typing at the somewhat awkward new angle .
One of the areas researchers feel the technology could be implemented is gaming , though we suspect there might be more important applications for this kind of interface … like virtual “ dating . ”
Check the video after the break to see the literal hands - on .

Should IBM
Run the DMV , CIA , and TSA ?
I blogged a few days ago about the sad fact that my beloved three - year - old child , a.k.a. 2687 , a black IBM ( Lenovo ) laptop , had to be repaired .
The LCD had gone dark .
I tried to get it fixed locally , but none of the vendors recommended by IBM could move fast enough .
Nor were any independent outfits like Geek Squad up to the task .
So I took the last resort : sending it back to IBM .
I was reluctant to do this for a variety of reasons , but it seemed the best alternative .
Although the IBM techs I ’d talked to on the phone were knowledgeable , pleasant , and fast ( I never even got put on hold ) , and even though I was assured I would n’t pay a penny for the work ( the machine is still under warranty ) , I was pessimistic .
The biggest downside was living that long without my laptop .
On Wednesday morning , IBM sent me a sturdy shipping box with a return DHL label .
On Wednesday early evening , I packed up my baby and sent her to a company called Solectron in Memphis .
I left town on Thursday ( to Madison , Wisc. — my first visit ; great town ) , and got home by late Friday morning .
There she was waiting for me , my smart little machine , all fixed up by someone halfway across the country , at a cost to me of $ 0.00 , the entire transaction taking about 36 hours .
I wish IBM made more things so I could buy them and know that if something went wrong , the repair process would always be this good .
This is the best customer service I ’ve ever encountered in my life .
Maybe IBM should be running a few other three - letter outfits .
Let ’s start with the DMV , CIA , TSA , and move on from there .
Researchers at Boston University School of Medicine ( BUSM ) and McLean Hospital have found that practicing yoga may elevate brain gamma- aminobutyric ( GABA ) levels , the brain 's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter .
The findings suggest that the practice of yoga be explored as a possible treatment for depression and anxiety , disorders associated with low GABA levels .
The World Health Organization reports that mental illness makes up to fifteen percent of disease in the world .
Depression and anxiety disorders both contribute to this burden and are associated with low GABA levels .
Currently , these disorders have been successfully treated with pharmaceutical agents designed to increase GABA levels .
This pose puts you in the Yoga Mudra
Using magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging , the researchers compared the GABA levels of eight subjects prior to and after one hour of yoga , with 11 subjects who did no yoga but instead read for one hour .
The researchers found a twenty - seven percent increase in GABA levels in the yoga practitioner group after their session , but no change in the comparison subject group after their reading session .
The acquisition of the GABA levels was done using a magnetic resonance spectroscopy technique developed by J. Eric Jensen , PhD , an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an associate physicist at McLean Hospital .
According to the researchers , yoga has shown promise in improving symptoms associated with depression , anxiety and epilepsy .
" Our findings clearly demonstrate that in experienced yoga practitioners , brain GABA levels increase after a session of yoga , " said lead author Chris Streeter , MD , an assistant professor of psychiatry and neurology at BUSM and a research associate at McLean Hospital .
" This study contributes to the understanding of how the GABA system is affected by both pharmacologic and behavioral interventions and will help to guide the development of new treatments for low GABA states , " said co-author Domenic Ciraulo , MD , professor and chairman of the department of psychiatry at BUSM .
" The development of an inexpensive , widely available intervention such as yoga that has no side effects but is effective in alleviating the symptoms of disorders associated with low GABA levels has clear public health advantage , " added senior author Perry Renshaw , MD , PhD , director of the Brain Imaging Center at Harvard - affiliated McLean Hospital .

Another day , another hedge fund casualty of Wall Street ’s subprime mortgage debacle .
Braddock Financial Corp.’s $ 300 million Galena Street Fund , the most recent victim of the collapse of subprime mortgage bonds , notified investors earlier in the week that it will be closing its doors .
The Denver - based Galena Street fund appears to have fallen prey to the investor panic surrounding default - ridden subprime bonds .
Shocked and scarred investors – prompted by the collapse of two Bear Stearns hedge funds – have been yanking assets from the hedge funds that invest in these bonds .
In turn , the hedge funds have been flooding the market with subprime mortgage bonds in order to raise cash needed to return to investors .
That has driven down prices across the board , depressing fund performance and making the bonds less attractive as collateral for loans .
Investors are expected to learn over the next two weeks just how much damage hedge funds have sustained as a result of the subprime mortgage mess , and if the news is as bad as some market players expect , there is a fear that investors could pull out in droves .
Already , some wide swaths of the $ 6 trillion mortgage - backed securities market have sold off sharply , adding to the concern that there could be many more Galena Street scenarios forthcoming .
A letter to Galena ’s investors , which was obtained by The Post , noted that as of June 30 , nearly 60 percent of its investors sought redemptions .
News about Galena was first reported in The Wall Street Journal .
Prior to being caught in the subprime crossfire , Galena Street gave little hint it was in trouble , reporting a 3.02 percent loss year - to - date , after returning 69.7 percent over the previous four - year period .
David Allon , a Braddock Financial principal , told The Post that the Galena liquidation not forced because it did not use any leverage , and that the fund ’s investors would get the first 20 percent of their capital back within a week .

Sunnis in Parliament Criticize al - Maliki ’s Security Plan
Pelosi warns Bush on Purse Strings
The killing by Iraqi guerrillas of 5 US troops was announced on Sunday .
Three of them were airmen assigned to a bomb squad .
Reuters reports other violence in Iraq , including the discovery in the capital on Sunday of 17 bodies .
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi got out ahead of a lot of Democratic lawmakers on Sunday , calling for Bush to justify the spending on sending extra troops to Iraq .
It is an old and key principle in parliamentary regimes that parliament controls the purse strings .
Pelosi is attempting to remind Bush of this control .
Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno is quoted as saying that 80 % of Iraq ’s militiamen are probably OK and could be put into the Iraqi security forces , while the other 20 % may have to be “ captured or killed . ”
This comment seems to me a welcome evidence of realism , much better than the conviction that the Sadr Movement can be defeated militarily .
But I fear that the “ more extreme ” militiamen are the cousins of the ones who are OK , and if you kill the cousin of an Iraqi , he has to kill you to restore clan honor .
So if you kill the 20 % , you turn the “ moderate ” militiamen into your deadly enemies .
Americans are so individualistic , they can’t seem to get their minds around clans and clan feuds .
This failure of understanding or imagination has underpinned a lot of the failure in Iraq .
What you do is to make a deal with the clan leaders and make them responsible for reining in the extremists , setting things up so that they are denied financial rewards if they fail to do so .
Of course this plan depends on your ability to guarantee the safety of the clan leaders , which at the moment the US military cannot do .
Rob Collier of the SF Chronicle reports on those experts who believe that negotiating with the Sunni Arab guerrillas is the only way out of the quagmire .
Saddam ’s execution has caused the neo -Baath angrily to pull out of talks .
Even the Jordanian parliament , a conservative and relatively pro-Western body with nary a Baathist among them , denounced the execution of Saddam Hussein .
Al - Zaman reports in Arabic on the new security plan for Baghdad put forth by PM al - Maliki .
Musa Abu Tawq and Ali al - Musawi write that some members of parliament have denounced the plan as unconstitutional because parliament has never been given the opportunity to vote on it .
MP Hussein al - Faluji of the Iraqi Accord Front ( Sunni religious ) insisted that the plan must be presented to parliament .
Others are criticizing the plan because it concentrates on Sunni West Baghdad and exempts Shiite Sadr City in the east .
Members of parliament warned that this lack of even - handedness would exacerbate civil conflict rather than ending it .
Kurdish politician Mahmud Osman objected to the planned use of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who are in Iraqi army units , saying he worried that it might provoke fighting between Arabs and Kurds .

Al - Hayat reports in Arabic that “ al - Qaeda ” in Fallujah assassinated Muhammad Mahmud , the head of the 1920 Revolution Brigades in the district of al - Saqlawiya , threatening al - Anbar Province with a feud between the two Sunni guerrilla groups .
( I fear this business of the Sunni guerrilla groups fighting each other is a minor phenomenon , though al - Hayat has been playing it up for a year .
During that year , any such tensions have had no effect on the deadly effectiveness of the guerrillas .
Besides , I thought the US military was taking retinal scans of everyone who returned to Fallujah and that it was now hunky dory even if 2/3s of the buildings had been damaged by the 2004 US assault .
So how come there are all these guerrilla groups in the city ? )
It says that the Association of Muslim Scholars , a hard line Sunni clerical group , called on the former officers of the Iraqi military to liberate Iraq from occupation .
Al - Hayat maintains that Baghdad looks half empty , with residents fearful to go out for fear of a guerrilla or militia attack .
Newsweek reports on the ways in which the US is losing the information war in Iraq , with guerrillas cannily spreading around images of attacks on US troops .
The chilling suggestion is made that some attacks are staged precisely to generate propaganda footage , i.e. the guerrillas are making snuff films with the GIs as victims .

A 21 - year employee of the school system could lose his job after officials accused him of repeatedly leaving early – and stunned the worker with data it got by tracking his movements with a city - issued cellphone , The Post has learned .
In a precedent - setting case , administrative trial judge Tynia Richard recommended the firing of John Halpin , a veteran supervisor of carpenters , for cutting out before the end of his shift on as many as 83 occasions between March 2 and Aug. 9 , 2006 .
The evidence against Halpin , whose base pay is $ 300 a day , included time cards that suspiciously appeared stamped on the same machine , even though his duties placed him in different locations each day .
But there was a clincher : data gathered through the GPS system on Halpin ’s cellphone , which he accepted in 2005 without being told it might be used to trace his every move .
On March 8 , for example , supervisors determined that Halpin was last in Manhattan at 1:31 p.m. and was home in Levittown , L.I. , at 2:40 p.m . On March 29 , Halpin was found at home at 2:38 p.m .
The earliest he was caught in Levittown was 1:40 p.m. on June 22 .
But his shift was n’t supposed to end until 3:30 p.m .
Some workers refused the free - phone offer , saying they preferred to use their own cells .
Richard said the unsuspecting Halpin “ admitted he took the phone because he liked the walkie - talkie and other functions it has . ”
She dismissed concerns about whether the city had to warn Halpin in advance of the cellphone ’s tracking abilities .
“ The department [ of Education ] is not expected to notify its employees of all the methods it may possibly use to uncover their misconduct , ” Richard decided .
“ The undisputed intent of issuing the cellphone with GPS was for the department to be able to determine the whereabouts of its supervisors in the field . ”
Rachel Minter , a lawyer who specializes in labor relations , said she knows of very few similar cases because the law has n’t caught up to the technology .
“ This is a very interesting case because it raises issues very much on the edge , ” she said .
Halpin questioned the reliability of the data and argued that his privacy was invaded , since officials tracked him when he was n’t at work .
In fact , the data found Halpin on numerous occasions turned up early for his job , sometimes at 6 a.m .
His shift started at 8 a.m .
Despite the extra hours Halpin put in without pay , Richard ruled that it did n’t mitigate his early departures and recommended he be fired .
Halpin has been removed from his duties and is awaiting word on whether Schools Chancellor Joel Klein will follow the administrative judge ’s recommendation .

Editorial A Fair Trade ?
Just how much are we willing to sacrifice for convenience ?
Quite a lot , it turns out .
By Ryan McGreal
Published April 09 , 2006
A group of clever scientists and engineers approach our political leaders and - stop me if you 've heard this one already - announce that they 've got a wonderful new invention that will make people 's lives easier and more comfortable , and generate thousands of well - paying jobs .
There 's just one drawback : for the invention to work , four thousand Canadians a year must be selected at random and killed .
What would the politicians do ?
Adopt it and try to draw attention away from the killings ?
Reject the invention out of hand , repulsed by its grisly price ?
What would you do ?
These are n't rhetorical questions .
The invention is n't hypothetical ; it 's real , and most of us use it regularly , each hoping at some level of consciousness that he or she is n't picked for termination .
It 's called the automobile , and there 's probably one or two parked in front of your house right now .
Even though I 've come across this story a few times over the years , it never ceases to grab my attention .
During the day - to - day minutiae of driving around , watching other motorists carefully , and avoiding collisions , it 's easy to forget that over the course of this year , one out of every thousand drivers will get into a car and set out on the last trip of his or her life .
Higher safety standards , better training , and more public education can certainly help to reduce the death toll .
That 's laudable , but it 's not going to solve the basic problem of millions of amateur drivers trusting each other to be alert and responsible .
Just yesterday while walking across Main St. , I saw an SUV nearly rear - end another SUV that was stopped at the light .
The driver was talking on a cell phone .
We can ban handheld cell phones , but we can't ban fatigue , distractions , preoccupations , poor judgment , self - absorption , overconfidence , or any of the myriad other factors that affect our attention .
In the meantime , people driving cars continue to kill themselves and each other .
Who has paid a legal or political price for the annual toll of the dead ( aside from the victims themselves ) ?
I 'm not talking about a particular reckless driver responsible for a particular death ; I mean very the system of driving everywhere that we have adopted , which makes those four thousand annual deaths an inevitability .
It 's like a class action lawsuit for negligence causing death , only with millions of defendants .
Who is willing to assume responsibility for this state of affairs ?
On whom can such responsibility even be laid ?
We certainly cannot throw everyone in jail , much as the Harper government might wish to .
If no individual can take responsibility for our driving culture of death and we cannot or will not take responsibility collectively , then how can we stop building more places that insist on us continuing to drive ?
Instead , we 've made what peace we can with those four thousand people slated to die in the next twelve months .
So perhaps your parents lied to you , and if enough people jump off a cliff , it does become a good idea .
I 'm not sure how else to explain our reluctance to give up this wonderful invention , which makes our lives easier but exacts a price that would n't have felt out of place in the final days of the Aztecs .
It is a cruel deity indeed who demands such sacrifice , whatever the putative gains .

If you ever wonder about Fox News editorial objectivity , look no further than today ’s politics page on the Fox News website , pictured below :
Of the 11 stories , I counted 4 negative stories on Democrats ( Did the New York Times ’ MoveOn deal break the law ? , Feds to indict Norman Hsu in $ 60 scheme for donations to Democrats – this was also the front page story entitled ‘ Dirty Dem ’ , Bad Medicine – Mitt Romney slams Hilary Clinton ’s health care plan , Hilary Wants to Change Our Country ) .
Compare this to the 2 negative Republican articles ( one of which is actually just a video of minority leader Boehner refuting Democratic charges for 3 minutes ) and the two positive Republican stories ( Safe at Home ? on Bush urging Congress for permanent expansion of electronic surveillance and the article on the Republican primary in Florida , Romney slamming Hilary ’s health plan ) .
So , to recap on the Fox News politics page : 4 negative stories on Democrats , 0 positive stories on Democrats , 3 positive stories on Republicans , and 1.5 negative stories on Republicans .
A " black mat " of algal growth in Arizona marks a line of extinction at 12,900 years ago ; Clovis points and mammoth skeletons were found at the line but not above it .

New scientific findings suggest that a large comet may have exploded over North America 12,900 years ago , explaining riddles that scientists have wrestled with for decades , including an abrupt cooling of much of the planet and the extinction of large mammals .
The discovery was made by scientists from the University of California at Santa Barbara and their colleagues .
James Kennett , a paleoceanographer at the university , said that the discovery may explain some of the highly debated geologic controversies of recent decades .
The period in question is called the Younger Dryas , an interval of abrupt cooling that lasted for about 1,000 years and occurred at the beginning of an inter - glacial warm period .
Evidence for the temperature change is recorded in marine sediments and ice cores .
According to the scientists , the comet before fragmentation must have been about four kilometers across , and either exploded in the atmosphere or had fragments hit the Laurentide ice sheet in the northeastern North America .
Wildfires across the continent would have resulted from the fiery impact , killing off vegetation that was the food supply of many of larger mammals like the woolly mammoths , causing them to go extinct .
Since the Clovis people of North America hunted the mammoths as a major source of their food , they too would have been affected by the impact .
Their culture eventually died out .
The scientific team visited more than a dozen archaeological sites in North America , where they found high concentrations of iridium , an element that is rare on Earth , and is almost exclusively associated with extraterrestrial objects such as comets and meteorites .
They also found metallic microspherules in the comet fragments ; these microspherules contained nano - diamonds .
The comet also carried carbon molecules called fullerenes ( buckyballs ) , with gases trapped inside that indicated an extraterrestrial origin .
The team concluded that the impact of the comet likely destabilized a large portion of the Laurentide ice sheet , causing a high volume of freshwater to flow into the north Atlantic and Arctic Oceans .
" This , in turn , would have caused a major disruption of the ocean 's circulation , leading to a cooler atmosphere and the glaciation of the Younger Dryas period , " said Kennett .
" We found evidence of the impact as far west as the Santa Barbara Channel Islands . "

The US marines say they came under fire after a roadside bombing
Staff Sgt Frank
Wuterich then told his comrades to lie about it and blame the Iraqi army , a court heard on Wednesday .
Sgt Sanick Dela Cruz was speaking at a hearing for one of the four officers charged with dereliction of duty for not investigating the killings .
Three other marines have been charged with second - degree murder .
Iraqi witnesses say the shootings were in retaliation for a roadside bomb that had killed Lance Cpl Miguel Terrazas as his convoy drove through Haditha , 240 km ( 150 miles ) north - west of Baghdad , on 19 November 2005 .
' Bad thing '
Sgt Dela Cruz also told the military courtroom at Camp Pendleton in California that he urinated on the body of an Iraqi civilian .
He told the court of the distress he felt after discovering the explosion had ripped Lance Cpl Terrazas , known as TJ , in half .
" I know it was a bad thing what I 've done , but I done it because I was angry TJ was dead and I pissed on one Iraqi 's head , " he said .
He also testified that after the explosion Staff Sgt Frank Wuterich had shot dead five men as they stood by a white car with the hands in the air .
" They were just standing , looking around , had hands up , " he said .
" Then I saw one of them drop in the middle . "
" Looked to my left , saw Sgt Wuterich shooting . "
Afterwards Sgt Dela Cruz said he himself had " sprayed " the bodies with gunfire .
" I knew they were dead , I wanted to make sure , " he explained .
Immunity
Sgt Wuterich then shot each of the men in the upper body and head , Sgt Dela Cruz testified .
He told me that if anybody asked , [ we should say ] they were running away and the Iraqi army shot them
Sgt Sanick Dela Cruz
" He went to every single one of them , sir , and shot them , " he added .
" He told me that if anybody asked , they were running away and the Iraqi army shot them . "
Sgt Wuterich 's lawyer , Neal Puckett , said Sgt Dela Cruz 's account was " false " and that he had told investigators up to five different versions of the events .
" It 's unfortunate that in exchange for his freedom he 's being forced to testify against his brothers , " Mr Puckett told the Associated Press .
In April , the Marine Corps dropped all charges against Sgt Dela Cruz and granted him immunity in exchange for his testimony .
If found guilty , the three marines charged with second - degree murder could face life imprisonment .
The Haditha inquiry is just one of a number the US military has been conducting into incidents of alleged unlawful killings by US forces in Iraq .
This is a guest post by Tom O’Leary .
A classroom full of 10 - year - old students is asked to solve a problem with children crossing the street on the way to school .
The children come up with ideas that have been used successfully in other places : traffic calming devices , overpasses , fluorescent jackets and speed limits .
All these ideas are conventional , exactly what the teacher wants to hear .
Except for one .
A student recommends that the school board sell the property and move the classroom online .
This is not what the teacher was expecting .
This idea may not be practical , popular , or even possible , but when it ’s ridiculed by the class it might be the last independent thought that the student dares to express — the death of another independent thinker .
Independent thought is not popular — it is absolutely , pricelessly , rare .
Nothing you read about in the papers or see on the television is independent .
Whatever we take in from the popular media is regurgitated conventional knowledge .
There is nothing independent about most of the world .
This is a tragedy — independent thought is essential for progress .
Conventional thinking moves us forward gradually at best ( at worst it pushes us backwards ) .
Independent thinking is required to achieve any substantial jump in performance .
Logically , when we think like everyone else is thinking , the best we can expect is to achieve what they ’re already achieving .
If our aim is to over - achieve , we need to avoid the same banal influences and think impossibly .
We need to become independent from conventional wisdom .
Fortunately , you do n’t have to be particularly intelligent or well educated to think independently .
Consider small children .
Conventional wisdom says that shoes are for wearing and bananas are for eating .
Independent thinking allows children try eating the shoes and wearing the bananas on their feet .
Their lack of conventional wisdom and utter disregard for how others view their decisions allows children to experiment without anxiety .
In this case they may be wrong , but in other cases they can be shockingly right .
Using these 5 strategies you can develop your independent thinking ability .
1. Disconnect from sources of conventional thinking
Instead of plugging into your TV , PC , or library for answers , think for yourself first .
Without cutting yourself off from the world , you can increase your capacity for independent thought by limiting the conventional opinion you absorb .
This means reducing the media you consume and the level of devotion you give to it .
Independent thinkers are n’t necessarily contrarian , but they do n’t agree with the status quo by default .
They devise new criteria for perceiving the world rather than seeing everything through the screen of their computer .
2. Immerse yourself in experiences that conflict with your current perspective
Instead of substituting a new conventional thought for the old one , deliberately seek out experiences that challenge your views .
These experiences may exist in foreign cultures , unusual subcultures , or between the pages of a book you disagree with .
The point is not to adopt a new train of thought , but to disrupt the conventional railroad .
3 . Watch the process from a distance
Leaving your normal life behind can give you the freedom to see issues from another perspective .
Watching the world instead of eating it up gives you the peace of mind to think for yourself .
Standing still from time to time gives you the opportunity to ridicule your own beliefs and explore new angles .
4. Randomize your sensory inputs
Instead of visiting the same places , eating the same foods , and talking to the same people , you can actively pursue new experiences .
Many people cling to the familiar to simplify decisions and create a sense of security .
If you truly want to think independently , you need to get outside your comfort zone .
5. Practice disbelief
Without becoming a cynic , you can develop the habit of instinctively distrusting thoughts that rely on conventional wisdom .
Instead of assuming that these “ truths ” are self evident , suspend judgement until you ’ve have confirmed that there is reality behind the logic .
If all of this sounds too difficult , consider what can be gained from independent thought .
Even microscopic steps towards thinking independently will increase your contribution to the world .
You will see opportunities and solutions that others overlook .
You will obtain a competitive advantage over less creative thinkers .
Most importantly , your thoughts will be your own and not just recycled media .
Think independently and you create a world of limitless opportunity .
But do n’t take my word for it …find out for yourself .

A new Portuguese law eliminates jail time for possession or use of small amounts of any illegal drug and instead sends drug users to a panel of experts , who provide assistance .
Jail sentences have been replaced with mandatory counseling or treatment and possibly community service or a fine of up to 30,000 escudos , about $ 130 .
The panels consist of a psychologist , a social worker and a legal adviser , who decide what action to take .
The new approach is drawing fierce criticism , especially from conservative politicians who argue that a wave of foreign '' drug tourists ' ' will head for Portugal .
'' We are offering sun , beaches and any drug you like , '' said Paulo Portas , leader of the conservative Popular Party .
Still , in shifting the focus of the police anti-drug efforts to traffickers instead of users , Portugal 's Socialist government has joined a European trend toward treating users as victims who need help , not punishment .
A majority of Google shareholders today voted against an anti-censorship proposal that took aim at the way the search giant conducts its business in China and other countries that engage in active censorship .
The company received a large amount of criticism last year on news that its Chinese search engine , Google.cn , engages in self - censorship .
Patrick Doherty , who introduced the proposal on behalf of the New York City pension funds and the Office of the Comptroller of New York City , referred to Google 's congressional testimony from last year ( listed on Google 's site ) , which acknowledged that " the requirements of doing business in China include self - censorship -- something that runs counter to Google 's most basic values and commitments as a company . "
The proposal would have required that Google not engage in self - censorship of its products , Doherty said , and also that the company clearly disclose when any censorship had occurred .
Google Opposed Measure
In response , David Drummond , senior vice president for corporate development , said flat out that " this proposal would prevent us from operating Google.cn . "
" Pulling out of China , shutting down Google.cn , is just not the right thing to do at this point , " he said .
" But that 's exactly what this proposal would do . "
The company 's board of directors had recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal .
Drummond also noted that Google is working with human - rights groups , socially responsible investors , and others to come up with guidelines for operating in such countries , but that " applying a rigid set of rules here is not always going to get us to the right outcome . "
Evidently the shareholders agreed .
The specific text of the failed proposal , available in the company 's online proxy statement , stated :
Data that can identify individual users should not be hosted in Internet - restricting countries , where political speech can be treated as a crime by the legal system .
The company will not engage in pro-active censorship .
The company will use all legal means to resist demands for censorship .
The company will only comply with such demands if required to do so through legally binding procedures .
Users will be clearly informed when the company has acceded to legally binding government requests to filter or otherwise censor content that the user is trying to access .
Users should be informed about the company 's data retention practices , and the ways in which their data is shared with third parties .
The company will document all cases where legally binding censorship requests have been complied with , and that information will be publicly available .
Foot and mouth disease is devastating to livestock , but rarely affects humans .
The ability of a virus to cause disease in one host but not another is a poorly understood but common phenomenon .
Scientists have recently found the remnants of a virus present in the genomes of chimpanzees and gorillas but absent in humans .
Humans , it appears , evolved resistance to this virus millions of years ago .
Paradoxically , however , the evolution of resistance to that now extinct virus may have made us more susceptible to HIV today .
Monkeys and humans are infected by many different viruses .
Some of them , called retroviruses , replicate in our DNA .
This type of retrovirus infection sometimes leaves a characteristic remnant of the virus , called an endogenous retrovirus , in the chromosome of the cell it infected .
Our own genome bears witness to many ancient epidemics .
It is littered with viral relics , as are the chromosomes of our close relatives , the apes and monkeys , which carry an endogenous retrovirus called PtERV .
Analysis of the virus indicates that it swept through both chimp and gorilla ancestral populations about 3 - 4 m years ago .
Yet , curiously , the human genome is free of it , despite the fact that our ancestors are thought to have shared an overlapping African habitat with the great apes at the same time .
A study recently published in the journal Science by a team led by virologist Michael Emerman at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle , Washington , attempts to discover how our ancestors escaped the epidemic that infected the apes .
The team 's aim was to resurrect part of the ancient virus from the chimp genome .
But each of the multiple copies of the endogenous retrovirus was subtly different .
Genes , like words , change with time ; so in the millions of years since their separation , the relic viruses have all diverged from their common ancestor .
To resurrect the original virus sequence the scientists used a technique familiar to linguists .
Milk is lait , latte or leche , depending on whether you are in a France , Italy or Spain .
Linguists comparing these words can reconstruct the original word in the ancestral language , which turns out to be pretty close to the Latin form , lacte .
In a similar manner the virologists were able to reconstruct the ancient DNA sequence of the 3 m - year - old virus from the chimp genome and then examine the host range of the ancient culprit .
The PtERV virus can only successfully infect an animal if it avoids destruction by a protein called TRIM5 alpha .
This protein acts a kind of gatekeeper for the cell .
The scientists studied whether the ancient virus could pass through the ape or the human version of the protein gate .
As expected , the virus derived from chimps was able to infect cells that had the gorilla version of the protein .
However , when switched to the human form , the virus replication dropped a hundredfold .
It appears that the human TRIM5 alpha protein is able to block infection by the ancient virus , possibly accounting for how our ancestors resisted it millions of years ago .
HIV belongs to the same family of retroviruses as PtERV , so the scientists were also interested in finding out whether the gatekeeping activity of the protein would keep out the Aids virus .
What they found was that although the modern human TRIM5 alpha protein was very effective at blocking the ape virus , it was very poor at blocking HIV infection .
Conversely , the ape form of the gatekeeping protein blocked HIV infection but allowed in the PtERV virus .
It seems that when one door was closed to infection , another one was opened .
Michael Emerman 's team speculates that 3 - 4 m years ago a PtERV epidemic swept through the African apes , including our ancestors .
A chance mutation in at least one hominid , our ancestor , made it resistant to the virus scourge sweeping the continent .
That mutation came at a hidden cost .
It may have saved our ancestors from extinction , but it cast a shadow into the 20th century when a new virus , HIV , emerged .
The gene that saved our ancestors from the ancient viral scourge provided little protection against the new virus .
The Aids epidemic is the price humanity is now paying for that ancient debt .
It seems we cannot easily escape our evolutionary heritage .

The government is failing in its historic duty of care towards frontline troops who put their lives on the line in Iraq and Afghanistan , forces charities and campaigners claim .
There is growing anger in the service community that the Military Covenant , which says soldiers should always be able to expect fair treatment in return for the rights they forgo , is not being upheld .
The newly - founded British Armed Forces Federation , Baff , says that the covenant is " now a dead letter " .
And in an unprecedented move , the Royal British Legion - widely known for its poppy appeal and welfare work for old soldiers - is to launch a campaign demanding that the government upholds the covenant and provides its armed forces and their families with proper care in return for asking them to risk making " the ultimate sacrifice for their country " .
The campaign aims to " address the growing sense of disillusionment among service personnel and veterans about their treatment by the state " .
" The Legion believes that our servicemen and women deserve more from their government .
By committing themselves to put their lives on the line for their country , they deserve immediate medical treatment and just compensation if they are injured , " the organisation says on its website .
Pressure on the government is growing after six men died under enemy fire in one of the bloodiest weeks in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It includes :
· The Legion 's campaign , to be launched during the autumn party conference season , will highlight medical care , military inquests and iniquities in the compensation system for injured troops ;
· The rising toll of the seriously injured , with casualty figures for this year already set to outstrip the whole of 2006 ;
· Growing concern about the mission purpose in Basra , where soldiers told MPs troops face " nightly suicide missions " ;
· Soldiers losing faith in their equipment - particularly the Snatch Land Rover , which is extremely vulnerable to roadside bombs
Last year General Sir Richard Dannatt , the head of the army , warned that the government was in danger of breaking the covenant .
Published as an army doctrine the covenant states that : " Soldiers will be called upon to make personal sacrifices - including the ultimate sacrifice - in the service of the nation .
In putting the needs of the nation and the army before their own , they forgo some of the rights enjoyed by those outside the armed forces .
In return , British soldiers must always be able to expect fair treatment , to be valued and respected as individuals , and that they ( and their families ) will be sustained and rewarded by commensurate terms and conditions of service . "
Douglas Young , chairman of Baff , told the Guardian : " If the military covenant is anything other than spin and hot air , then it has to be at the forefront of policymakers ' minds whenever defence policy is being formulated and not just trotted out when there 's a good news story .
The sacrifices made by members of all three armed services in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere in the past few years have been immense and in return they need to be recognised with the special consideration that the covenant appears to promise . "
A spokesman for the Legion said it had decided to focus on medical care , coroners ' inquests and compensation .
Last month it emerged that a civilian typist with the RAF received a payment of £ 484,000 after injuring her thumb at work while a 23 - year - old paratrooper , Ben Parkinson , who will need care for the rest of his life after a serious landmine injury , will be given £ 152,150 .
Many injured personnel have still to receive their payments .
Mounting fatalities have added to the backlog of inquests , with more than 100 families waiting to hear the coroner rule how their relative died .
The Legion is looking at whether the government should be providing legal counsel .
The Legion spokesman said : " This is not an Iraq / Afghanistan campaign .
It is for the whole of the service community .
However , it 's true that the service charities have seen an increase in their workload as a result of certain operations . "
Ernie Stables , of the British Limbless Ex-Service Men's Association , said : " We have got about 43 people who have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan , who have either lost their limbs or the use of limbs , or an eye .
Probably about 26 of those have come to us in the last year . "
Sue Norton , wife of Captain Peter Norton , who lost his left arm and leg and suffered nerve damage to his right leg while defusing a landmine in Iraq , said she supported the Legion 's campaign .
Although the government helped the wounded initially , there was a " lack of cohesive support for the family as a whole " .
" There 's injured personnel , but there 's their family too and there has been a lack of joined up thinking with regard to that , " she said .
" The government should be getting their finger out and doing something about it . "
On Satisfaction
You can eat so much food that your belly aches — yet you still want more !
Even though your belly is filled to the point of physical pain , you , the self , are not full ; you still desire to consume more .
The fact that the body can be full or satisfied while you still feel empty is evidence that the body is not you .
If you believe that you are your body , you will strive endlessly to give your body sensual pleasure .
You will struggle to fill up your inner emptiness with fleeting sensual flashes .
But no amount of sensual pleasure will satisfy you .
No matter how many taste orgasms , sexual orgasms , and other kinds of orgasms you may have , you still wo n’t be actually satisfied .
You ’ll always have a never ending desire for more .
No matter how much sensual pleasure people have , no matter how much they consume , they always want more .
This endless personal craving manifests as ever increasing material consumption .

WASHINGTON -- Government secrecy is growing at an unprecedented rate , harming the public 's right to know about its government 's activities and protect itself against terrorist threats , according to a new report by groups concerned about the trend .
The Bush administration has used its executive powers to curtail access to information , expand the power to classify information , and create a range of categories of " sensitive " information , according to OpenTheGovernment.org and People for the American Way .
" As Congress and the White House clash over this administration 's unprecedented secrecy , Americans need to know the full scope of the problem , " said Patrice McDermott , director of OpenTheGovernment.org , a coalition of conservative and liberal groups concerned about government secrecy .
White House officials have long contended that the threat from Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups makes it necessary to keep sensitive information from disclosure .
" President Bush strongly believes that openness and transparency are essential hallmarks of American democracy , " said White House spokeswoman Emily A. Lawrimore .
" He is committed to providing the American people with as much information as possible about his decisions on a wide range of issues , including national security , " she said .
But increased secrecy results in less accountability , said Ralph G. Neas , founder of People For the American Way , an advocacy group .
" At a time when technology should make it easier than ever to promote openness in government , George W. Bush and Dick Cheney have taken unprecedented steps to cloak themselves in secrecy . "
The 45 - page report offers a comprehensive look at how federal agencies are making more documents " secret " and even removing them from the public shelves to re classify them .
On an average day , federal agencies classify nearly 40,000 documents .
In 2005 , agencies classified 14.2 million documents , up from 3.5 million documents in 1995 .
For every dollar spent declassifying those documents , the government spends $ 134 marking them secret , according to the report .
" The biggest problem is the prevalence of mis classification , " the report found .

An Honest Look at Django
I ’ve written a few posts on Django and those were mostly a response to Django ’s admin interface .
However , when I switched to building a web application in Django instead of Ruby on Rails , I saw the benefits immediately .
Faster , easier and more productive .
Period .
In Rails there are different ways to do anything .
The approaches can become easily unlimited depending on your skill level .
For a developer like myself who is primarily a designer , it seemed less appealing that I had to spend 60 % of my time learning how to do it right .
Do n’t get me wrong , I want to do it right .
Nevertheless Rails documentation and the elitist community did n’t shine light on anything .
I realized then and there , Rails is not for newbies .
I ’m almost positive there are plenty who disagree , but the fact of the matter is your disagreement is irrelevant cause you ’re not me .
Moving on .
I ’ve bought all the “ important ” books for Ruby and Rails and have come to the conclusion that Rails is n’t as productive as it claims to be .
Surely its more productive than what we ’ve had over the years in the shadow of Java , PHP and others .
But I ’m speaking mainly about building production ready web applications and web sites .
This is where I came back to Django .
Previously , Rails gave me good fuzzy feelings and the only reason I took to it was because it had a larger influence and everybody else was doing it .
Now that reality has set in , I needed something that was less hassle .
So I ’ve switched to Django .
Why Django over Rails ?
Deployability – Rails is not easy to deploy on shared host environments .
When I say easy , I mean I should have the proper control to start and stop my application layers whether they be servers or just applications .
Rails needed at least Mongrel to work smoothly .
And if you really wanted your projects to sing , you ’d had to incorporate more stacks .
Django leaves this to be optional .
Django runs well no matter how many stacks you have .
Portability – Django was built to run on any hardware anywhere .
It runs well with older versions of MySQL and Apache , so on and so forth .
So moving my projects from one server to another was simple .
Rails on the other hand leaves all the heavy lifting to the developer .
Quietly , Rails in a nutshell is a luxury framework .
CRUD and the Admin – Often I like to test and validate my model structures before adding end - user centric functionality on top .
To do this in rails I have to build “ non-scaffoldish ” admin intefaces and relate my data manually .
Django does n’t make me do this .
It does it all for me and it looks hot at that .
It makes CRUD and the admin UI enjoyable .
Views and Templates – They just make sense .
I hate recreating the same layouts over and over again , luckily both Rails and Django create paths of least resistance in this area , however Django does a better job .
Those are just a few things Django has proved itself in and as time moves on , I will post more about how Django does documentation .
Stay tuned .
If you 're old enough , you probably remember fondly the warm glow of vacuum tubes from inside the family television or radio but likely do n't wish for the good old days of vinyl records , preferring the convenience of Compact Discs .
A Tokyo - based company is hoping to bring together the best of those worlds and do it with style .
Supercent has combined a CD player and radio with an amplifier built with vacuum tubes , or valves , and hopes to begin sales next year .
The device even includes a jack that Supercent used to connect an iPod for a fusion of cutting edge digital audio technology with 50 - year old amplification technology .
It 's been built into a wooden case designed to look like an old - style radiogram .
A large grill covers the front of the player , which is about 60 centimeters long by 27 cm high by 29 cm deep , and it sits on four thin silver legs .
" I think it 's good to see the lights come on when you use audio , it 's a fantastic moment , " said Atsushi Koike , one of the two designers behind the product .
He was demonstrating it at Tokyo Designers Week 2008 , an event held over the weekend in Tokyo .
" I feel like these vacuum tubes are like musicians playing music on a stage , " he said of the three tubes that protrude from the top of the player and glow a gentle orange when in use .
" These guys are playing music in front of you , that 's the concept . "
Touch - sensitive buttons are inlaid along the top of the player but aside from these very basic controls the entire unit is devoid of anything more significant .
" I wanted to buy an audio system for my father , " said Tadahito Ishibashi , the other designer who worked on the player .
" But all of the ones on the market were packed with so many functions and buttons and were just too complicated to use to I made this one . "
Vacuum tubes are fondly remembered by many for the warm sound of the audio they produced and some audio aficionados today spend large amounts of money on such amplifiers completely shunning more modern digital products .
In a modern twist the player 's CD 's digital display doubles as a countdown clock to the time the vacuum tubes are warmed up and ready for use and serves to remind children of the digital generation that ' switch on and go ' is n't something to be expected from vacuum tubes .
In a demonstration it took about 20 seconds for them to warm - up .
Supercent has n't yet finalized the price or specific launch plans .

In the first experiments able to mimic the crushing , searing conditions found in Earth 's lower mantle , and simultaneously probe tell - tale properties of iron , scientists * have discovered that material there behaves very differently than predicted by models .
The research also points to the likelihood of a new zone deep in the Earth .
Surface phenomena such as volcanoes and earthquakes are generated by what goes on in Earth 's interior .
To understand some of these surface dynamics , scientists have to probe deep into the planet .
The lower mantle is between 400 and 1,740 miles deep ( 650 km - 2,800 km ) and sits atop the outer core .
Coauthor of the paper , Viktor Struzhkin of the Carnegie Institution 's Geophysical Laboratory explains : " The deeper you go , the higher the pressures and temperatures become .
Under these extreme conditions , the atoms and electrons of the rocks become squeezed so close together that they interact very peculiarly .
In fact , spinning electrons in iron , which is prevalent throughout the inner Earth , are forced to pair up .
When this spin state changes from unpaired electrons -- called a high - spin state -- to paired electrons - - a low - spin state -- the density , sound velocities , conductivity , and other properties of the materials can change .
Understanding these conditions helps scientists piece together the complex puzzle of the interior / surface interactions . "
The pressures in the lower mantle are brutal , ranging from about 230,000 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level ( 23 GPa ) , to almost 1.35 million times sea -level pressure ( 135 GPa ) .
The heat is equally extreme -- from about 2,800 to 6,700 degrees Fahrenheit ( 1800 K -- 4000 K ) .
Using a laser - heated diamond anvil cell to heat and compress the samples , the scientists subjected ferropericlase to almost 940,000 atmospheres and 3,140 °F .
They analyzed it using so - called X - ray emission spectroscopy .
As its name suggests , ferropericlase is iron - laden .
It is also the second most prevalent material found in the lower mantle .
Previous to this study , ferropericlase has been subjected to high pressures , but only to room temperatures .
The new experiments are the highest pressures and temperatures attained to probe the spin state of iron in the mineral at lower - mantle conditions .
Under the less - intense conditions of the former experiments , the high - spin to low - spin transition occurs in a narrow pressure range .
In the new study , however , both spin states coexisted in the same crystal structure and the spin transition was also continuous over a large pressure range , indicating that the mineral is in a complex state over a large range in depth in the planet .

" We were expecting to find a transition zone , but did not know how extended it may be in the Earth 's mantle , " commented Struzhkin .
" Our findings suggest that there is a region or ' spin- transition zone ' from about 620 miles to 1,365 miles deep , where high spin , unpaired electrons , transition to low spin , paired electrons .
The transitioning appears to be continuous over these depths .
At pressures representing a lower depth of about 1,365 miles the transition stops and ferropericlase is dominated by low - spin electrons . "
Since measurements that scientists use to determine the composition and density of the inner Earth , such as sound velocities , are influenced by the ratio of high - spin / low - spin states , the new finding calls into question the traditional techniques for modeling this region of the planet .
In addition , a continuous spin transition zone may explain some interesting experimental findings including why there has been no significant iron partitioning , or separating , into ferropericlase or perovskite , the most prevalent mineral in the region .
The research also suggests that the depth of the transition zone is less than scientists had speculated .
The existence of this transition zone may also account for seismic - wave behavior at those depths .
The fact that the lowermost area is dominated by denser low - spin material could also affect the temperature stability of mantle upwellings -- the generators of volcanic hotspots , such as those in Hawaii .
" This paper solves only part of the puzzle , " cautioned Struzhkin .
" Since the major lower mantle mineral perovskite has not been measured yet with this technique , we know there are more surprises to come . "
" The spin transition zone of iron needs to be considered in future models of the lower mantle , " said Choong - Shik Yoo , a former staff member at LLNL and now a professor at Washington State University .
" In the past , geophysicists had neglected the effects of the spin transition when studying the Earth 's interior .
advertisement
Since we identified this zone , the next step is to study the properties of lower mantle oxides and silicates across the zone .
This research also calls for future seismic and geodynamic tests in order to understand the properties of the spin transition zone . "
" The benchmark techniques developed here have profound implications for understanding the electronic transitions in lanthanoid and actinoid compounds under extreme conditions because their properties would be affected by the electronic transitions , " said Valentin Iota , a staff member in LLNL's Physics and Advanced Technologies Directorate .
The work is published in the September 21 , 2007 , issue of Science .

IN MANY ARTS , such as painting , poetry , woodworking and arrogance , Americans have made significant contributions .
We have few rivals when it comes to growing marijuana or blowing stuff up .
But in one art we are as inventive as small appliances or perhaps cucumbers .
I speak of the art of political advertising .
American politicians expend untold billions of dollars on campaign commercials .
Not only do these ads all appear to have been produced by the same vicious idiot , it appears that this vicious idiot has been lobotomized and then repeatedly , thoroughly concussed .
That is why as Americans we all owe a debt of aesthetic gratitude to the genius of former senator and current Democratic presidential candidate Mike Gravel , who has taken the pabulum and kitsch that is our political art and transcended it — swept it up , summarized it and broken through it into a new range of possibilities .
Mike Gravel is to political advertising what Ralph Waldo Emerson is to the essay , Walt Whitman to poetry , Jackson Pollock to painting , 50 Cent to bullet wounds .
He is the avant garde of the new artpolitical era .
The medium of Gravel ’s genius is YouTube , but he ought to be on every cable network and broadcast channel in the country .
In one ad , he appears in front of a pond .
He stares at the camera for about a minute , just squints at us all , confronting us with the very essence of human existence .
His silence , it emerges on a careful listening , is infinitely more expressive than the words of Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama , and is a bolder and more precise formulation of policy initiatives .
Then Gravel picks up a rock and throws it into the pond .
Then he walks slowly away .
In another ad , Gravel gathers firewood .
Then for about seven minutes we simply watch a fire burning .
These are Dadaist campaign ads , as revolutionary in their context as Duchamp ’s urinal , Warhol ’s Marilyns , Washington crossing the Delaware , Bugs Bunny ’s attack on Elmer Fudd .
But how are they to be interpreted ?
Chucking a rock into a pond and lighting a fire are acts with extreme symbolic resonance .
As Gravel ’s act ripples over the world ’s waters , growing ever less sizable until a single molecule washes up in New Zealand , his message or his messagelessness permeates the entire environment , undetectably changing everything .
Perhaps Billy Joel — who should be writing music for the Edwards ’ campaign — did n’t start the fire .
But Gravel did .
These “ symbolist ” readings are , however , impoverished .
I prefer to think of it like this :
In American politics , language has been so emptied of meaning that silence is the only remaining medium of expression .
Spend the next 20 years debating whether the immigration bill = amnesty ; meanwhile , people , as Gravel shows us with unremitting clarity , are still crossing borders .
Gravel ’s works bring us out of the yapyap — the blah , blah , blah , yackety , smackety , if I may — and back to the things themselves , the reality that exists before and outside our words , the reality that eventually shuts us up or kills us .
The ads are both a commentary on the emptiness of our political discourse — a parody if you like — and a refutation of that emptiness , or a triumph over it , a reinsertion of brute content , a silent explosion of truth into a world of mere and moronic fiction .
Our politicians are voids or spreading zones of emptiness , a set of focus - grouped phrases and nice outfits , a congeries of cliches , representations of which there is no reality .
In the terms of the late theoretician Jean Baudrillard , our politics is a precession of simulacra .
But Gravel ’s politics reminds us that if someone were to drop an anvil or a piano on you from a tall building , you would amount to a puddle .
Gravel ’s works confront us with our own existences and our deaths , the brute thereness of truth , the skull beneath the $ 400 haircut , the cellulite under the pants suit .
His is neo-existentialist , post - apocalyptic , post - post modern art , a silence that screams and cajoles .
Gravel ’s politics are a politics of the body and of the physical world , of what is underneath our language and above it , what is broken and beautiful , the real world of human beings .
I suggest to you that a Gravel presidency would lead to an entirely new America , doing to us what cubism did to post - impressionism : dragging us moaning in glorious epiphanic pain into a new world .
It may be that Gravel , like Vincent van Gogh , Friedrich Nietzsche or indeed , Crispin Sartwell , is a premature birth of an astonishing future .
He may toil in obscurity , misunderstood or ignored in his own time .
And yet , whether we can fully theorize him or not , Mike Gravel , though he may never be president , has brought us all to the very brink of political ecstasy .

Hmmm …
Maybe it ’s not so bad to drink Dr. Pepper after all .
A recent Cornell University study has found that nearly half of deaths worldwide are caused or exacerbated by environmental pollution , including water pollution .
David Pimentel , the Cornell professor of ecology and evolutionary biology who conducted the research , links 62 million deaths each year to organic or chemical pollutants , placing these factors alongside long - known killers such as heart disease .
Increasing rates of Malaria , E. coli , Salmonella , AIDS , and Tuberculosis all are linked to environmental degradation , according to Pimentel .
“ In the United States alone , 76,000 people are in the hospital each year , with 5,000 deaths , just due to pollution of air , food , or water , ” he said .
“ Cancers are increasing in the U.S. , and AIDS is on the rise . ”
Fossilized dinosaurs often have wide - open mouths , heads thrown back and tails that curve toward the head .
Paleontologists have long assumed the dinosaurs died in water and the currents drifted the bones into that position , or that rigor mortis or drying muscles , tendons and ligaments contorted the limbs .
" I 'm reading this in the literature and thinking , ' This does n't make any sense to me as a veterinarian , ' " said Cynthia Marshall Faux , a veterinarian - turned - paleontologist at the Museum of the Rockies .
Faux and a colleague say brain damage and asphyxiation are the more likely culprits .
A classic example of the posture , which has puzzled paleontologists for ages , is the 150 - million - year - old Archaeopteryx , the first - known example of a feathered dinosaur and the proposed link between dinosaurs and present - day birds .
" Virtually all articulated specimens of Archaeopteryx are in this posture , exhibiting a classic pose of head thrown back , jaws open , back and tail reflexed backward and limbs contracted , " said Kevin Padian , professor of integrative biology and curator in the Museum of Paleontology at the University of California , Berkeley .
He Faux ( pronounced " Fox " ) published their findings this week in the journal Paleobiology .
Some animals found in this posture may have suffocated in ash during a volcanic eruption , consistent with the fact that many fossils are found in ash deposits , Faux and Padian said .
But many other possibilities exist , including disease , brain trauma , severe bleeding , thiamine deficiency or poisoning .
" This puts a whole new light on the mode of death of these animals , and interpretation of the places they died in , " Padian said .
" This explanation gives us clues to interpreting a great many fossil horizons we did n't understand before and tells us something dinosaurs experienced while dying , not after dying . "
Also , because the posture has been seen only in dinosaurs , pterosaurs and mammals , which are known or suspected to have had high metabolic rates , it appears to be a good indicator that the animal was warm blooded , as other research has suggested .
Animals with lower metabolic rates , such as crocodiles and lizards , use less oxygen and so might have been less traumatically affected by hypoxia during death throes , Padian said .
Padian acknowledged that many dinosaur fossils show signs that the animal died in water and the current tugged the body into an arched position , but currents cannot explain all the characteristics of an opisthotonic pose .

I 've been a beautiful woman for fifty days , and no one has compared me to a summer 's day .
No one has said my lips are like rose blossoms or my throat is as smooth as alabaster .
Men do n't have time for that anymore .
We live in the age of transparency .
Say what you mean and mean what you say .
As in :
" You are a very pretty lady . "
" I think you are very attractive . "
" You look very pretty . "
I 've been approached by more than six hundred men , and that 's one of the big themes I 've discovered in their method :
Cut to the chase .
The directness has its charms , but like everything else about being a beautiful woman , it has its dark side as well .
One suitor tried to seduce me with this line : " I would like to stalk you . "
Another said , " I am in a committed relationship but am looking for a girl on the side . "
Honest ?
Sure .
To the point ?
Yes .
Creepy ?
As hell .
I 'm getting ahead of myself .
Let me back up .
I stumbled into my role as a hot woman .
It was n't premeditated .
As a general rule , I dislike female impersonation .
I have too many bad associations of men in skirts -- Benny Hill , Uncle Milty , Idi Amin .
But sometimes there are good -- or at least excusable -- reasons to pose as a female .
The reason in this case is my two - year - old son 's nanny , Michelle .
She 's a stunning woman .
Before my wife and I hired her , I thought that hot nannies existed only in vintage Penthouse Forum letters and Aaron Spelling dramas .
But Michelle -- though I 've changed her name for this story -- is real .
She 's twenty - seven and looks like a normal - lipped Angelina Jolie .
She 's sweet , funny , has a smile straight out of a cruise - line commercial , and wears adorable tank tops .
No one can believe quite how beautiful my nanny is .
Among our friends , Jude Law 's name comes up about twice a week .
Michelle is so enchanting , my wife has actually given me permission to have an affair with her , à la Curb Your Enthusiasm .
Of course , she only made the offer because she knew there was no chance Michelle would ever be interested .
Michelle is too sweet , too Catholic , too loyal , too young .
It 's like giving me permission to become a linebacker for the Dolphins .
In any case , Michelle remains bafflingly single .
So my wife and I decided to help her find a boyfriend .
How about Internet dating , we suggested ?
Michelle balked .
She 's shy .
She 's not a big fan of e-mail .
Her Internet 's down .
And are n't all the guys on those sites the kind that have a drawerful of ball gags ?
We told her that 's an outdated stereotype .
We 'd help her out .
Or I would , since my job is editing and writing .
I 'd sign her up for a dating site , create a profile , sift through her suitors , and cowrite her e-mails .
I 'd be her online bouncer , bodyguard , censor , and Cyrano .
All she'd have to do is give me some input and allow a few guys to buy her lattes .
She agreed .
And even started to like the idea .
She wrote her own introductory essay .
( " I want someone who will make me laugh at the littlest thing . " )
We clicked her preferences ( fish and dogs are the best pets ) and uploaded seven smiley , PG - rated photos with nothing more risqué than an exposed shoulder or two .
At 8:00 P.M. on a Wednesday , a couple of hours after Michelle had gone home , her profile was approved and popped up online .
I 'd been anxious about this .
What if it went unnoticed for weeks , gathering dust in an obscure corner of the Internet ?
No need to worry .
Her profile was viewed within the first three minutes .
Then again a minute later .
The page - view counter shot up to eight , fourteen , twenty .
Not quite Huffington
Post numbers but brisk traffic .
And then the e-mails started pinging in .
A good dozen before I went to bed .
I know that technically these guys are n't e-mailing me .
Still , it 's an exhilarating feeling to be so desired , if only by proxy .
( And mind you , I did type in the essay and clean up her grammar . )

:-D
" Hey baby , tell me you 're coming to London , " reads my first e-mail from a British ad guy .
Michelle has given me permission to reject the guys who are clearly wrong .
An ocean qualifies as a deal breaker .
I zap him back , " Sorry guvnor , no plans to come over there . "
I liked my response .
Polite and firm -- but a little flirty .
I 'm getting into character .
The next day , I show Michelle a half dozen men with potential .
The cute scientist with the Prince Charles ears , the guy from Long Island with eight siblings .
We respond : " How are you ? "
" How was your week ? "
We keep it light , noncommittal -- and short .
That 's an early lesson .
I 've always been the chaser , so I did n't realize quite how radically the balance of power shifts when you 're the chasee .
Michelle could have responded with a random string of letters and numbers , perhaps an umlaut and a backward slash , and these guys would be encouraged enough to ask her on a date .
After forty - five minutes of boyfriend shopping , Michelle leaves with our son for a trip to the museum .
I spend an hour crafting personal rejection notes to yesterday 's discard pile .
Hello sexygentleman ,
Thanks for the email .
I do n't think we 're quite the right match .
But it was nice of you to contact me .
Good luck in your search !
By the way -- just a friendly tip :
The username sexygentleman might turn some women off .
Maybe too on the nose .
Perhaps it is n't my place to say so .
But , I figured , it is Michelle's .
If a beautiful woman gave me advice -- solid , well - intentioned advice -- I 'd pay attention .
Originally , I planned to send a personal ding letter to each of the unsuitable guys .
But the volume is overwhelming .
By day four , we 've gotten close to fifty approaches .
I 'm starting to become shockingly picky .
I have a growing list of instant deal breakers :
• If the guy uses the word lady or ladies in his opening e-mail .
• If the guy lists his best feature as " butt " ( ironically or not ) .
• If the guy uses more than two exclamation points in one sentence .
( One enthusiast wrote : " Hello there beautiful !!!!!!!!!!!!! " )
• If the guy misspells the first word of his introductory essay .
( " Chemestry is important . " )
I do n't want to be a spelling snob , but the first word ?
• If the guy 's opening photo features a shot in which his head is tilted more than 20 degrees to the left or right .
• If the guy has a photo of his Jet Ski or snowmobile on his page .
• If the guy is wearing sunglasses , any hat besides a baseball cap , or is bare chested in his main photo .
• If the guy refers to female anatomy anywhere in his initial correspondence ( e.g. , " I 'm not a professional gynecologist , but , uh , I 'd be happy to take a look " ) .
Never in my life have I had such power .
It 's tremendous .
Yes , at first I feel guilty about failing to respond to 70 percent of these guys .
But it 's just not possible .
And in a way , it makes me feel better about my life as a single man .
Maybe when my calls to beautiful women went unreturned , it was n't because I was hideous or the women were evil .
It was just a matter of time management .
Or at least I can tell myself that .

I am rooting for one guy .
He 's got a warm , unforced smile , and he 's humble , but not falselyhumble .
" I 'm a geek , but a cool geek because I use a Mac , " he writes .
Unfortunately , Michelle rejects him .
He 's a drummer and music teacher .
Her last boyfriend was a musician .
She 's sworn off them .
Michelle and I respond to a lot of the e-mails together .
But just as often , she tells me to go ahead and reply myself while she 's away .
It 's an amazing ego massage , sending e-mails as a beautiful woman .
It 's so easy .
I type one moderately witty thing -- not even moderately witty -- and I 'm fucking Stephen Colbert .
I told one guy that Michelle / I hang out at the Museum of Natural History , where there are " more nannies per square inch than any other place in America , " and he responded that he was laughing uncontrollably at work .
He said Michelle is " funny , intelligent , caring AND gorgeous . "
It 's not always adulation , though .
A few suitors take a snotty tone .
One writes that he wants to know more about Michelle , but adds , " I can tell from your profile that sometimes you 're a handful . "
That 's annoying .
I respond : " What gives you the idea that I 'm sometimes a handful ? "
He responds : " I am so right ! "
Now the bastard has really pissed me off .
I click on his profile .
A John Turturro look - alike with a smug smile .
His opening photo shows him with his arm around a pretty woman with large breasts , as if to say , " I hang around with hot , large - breasted women , so if you are a hot , large - breasted woman , you should also hang around with me . "
He likes to " work hard and play harder . "
He is " VERY spiritual . "
Michelle is not a handful .
In her profile , she says that she 's very open and will let you know when she 's upset .
That makes her a handful ?
But I have a theory .
I think the fucker is employing an underhanded strategy .
I edited an article a couple of years ago about a book called The Game , by Neil Strauss .
It 's about a nebbishy guy who decides to become the world 's greatest pickup artist , and it became exceedingly popular with a certain type of single man .
One major strategy Strauss talks about is to mildly insult a beautiful woman , lower her self - esteem , thus making her more vulnerable to your advances .
So I e-mail handful guy as Michelle : " Have you read the Game by Neil Strauss ? "
He says , " What makes you ask me that ? "
Yes !
Busted .
I respond : " I was wondering if your first email was a neg . " A " neg " is pickup patois for the mild insult .
He shoots back : " No , it was playful teasing .
And yes , I have read the book . "
Thus commences a flurry of e-mails arguing whether his line qualifies as a neg .
Finally , he brings out his trump card : " Considering that I know most of the people in the book personally from before the book was released , I 'm gonna have to disagree . "
Aha .
I hit the sleazeball jackpot , a longtime pickup artist .
I tell him I 'm glad my womanly radar warned me against him .
He says , " I was hoping online dating would introduce me to different girls than the ones I pick up and seduce in bars , clubs and starbucks .
So far not . "
It was the closest thing to an admission of guilt that I was going to get .
I write , " Just remember as you wade through the dating pool [ his lame metaphor , by the way ] : we women are not just here to be conquered as part of the game . "
I 'm a magnet for scammers .
Everyone wants down my pants .
Michelle probably would have sniffed this guy out eventually , but I 'm proud that I saved her from a date .
:-(
I was actually preparedfor the scammers and the swagger .
What I did n't expect was many men's tragic vulnerability when faced with a dazzling woman .
One guy frets that his eyes look weird in his photos because he tried to blacken out the red eye from the camera .
He just wants Michelle to know they are n't that weird in real life .
A martial - arts enthusiast admits flat out that he's not worthy of Michelle but wants to let her know that " you are gorgeous . "
A forty - one - year - old classical musician writes , " Not being striking in the looks department , I am someone who needs a chance to show his intellect and soul .
And I realize how hard that will be when the first impression is made by pictures and written words , but I most sincerely hope you will give me the benefit of the doubt . "
You want to take these guys out for a milk shake .
Or sign them up for Tony Robbins .
Michelle and I send them encouraging notes : " You are a bit out of my age range , so I do n't think it will work out .
But I think you 're a nice - looking gentleman . "
Still , it 's rejection , and a lot of men take it hard .
" Never will we share a malbec overlooking the Rio at CÛrdoba in Argentina , " writes one Harley - riding architect .
" Never will we stand together in Amsterdam looking at Vermeer 's Woman Pouring Milk .
Never will I hold your hand .
Never will I look into your eyes .
Never will you look into mine . "
A bit over - the - top , but I know what he 's saying .
I will never hold Michelle 's hand , either , aside from in a game of ring - around - a- rosy .
The power of a beautiful woman 's words is beginning to scare me .
One guy begins his introductory essay , " When I was a child , I witnessed a clown jump to his death from a seven - story building .
It was the only time a clown has made me laugh . "
So I write him back on behalf of Michelle : " You 're funny , but too dark for a sweet girl like me . "
Both of which are true .
" Just tell me I 'm ugly , " he said .
A few days later , he changed his profile to an essay about his love of Care Bears and snuggling .
Yes , it was a joke , but there was an underlying sense of despair .
He e-mailed Michelle that he really wanted to meet her .
He needs a sweet girl .
His revamped profile is only for her .
" I made it in response to you . "
Men will do anything for you .
:-\
Michelle has her first off - line date tonight , and I 'm freaking out .
It 's with the scientist guy who wears a lot of Patagonia jackets in his photos .
I keep staring at my cell phone , jittery as a dad with a daughter at the prom .
Michelle text messages me from the Starbucks where they were supposed to meet .
He never showed up .
" That 's it for me and online dating , " she writes .
" It really is n't for me . "
She 's surprisingly sensitive .
She should have Trump - like self - esteem , but she gets stood up once and she quits the game .
I 'm furious at this Ph.D. bastard .
I spend an hour tracking down his real name on the Internet .
( I know his alma mater and his specialty in marine biology . )
I consider showing up outside his office and asking him why he's an emotional retard .
Do you know what you 've just blown , you idiot ?
Plus , in one of his e-mails , the guy said he did n't like pancakes .
What kind of asshole does n't like pancakes ?
Then I just get depressed and insecure .
What did we say that made him blow us off ?
It was n't her looks .
So it must have been our banter .
Did we not talk enough about reef decay in Honduras ?
Dammit .
My walk on the feminine side is over .
My vicarious single life is dead .
The next day , the scientist e-mails .
He was actually at the Starbucks .
He was waiting outside .
And Michelle , turns out , was waiting inside .
Come on !
This guy can't even find a beautiful woman in a Starbucks the size of your average living room .
But Michelle and I are both relieved .
She agrees to try again .
I make another plea with her to give the smiley rocker a chance .
I e-mailed him that " I had a bad experience with musicians . "
He shot back that he 's " NOT " that guy .
He 's been sending us long e-mails about his family , his career , and the magnificence of xylophones .
He apologizes for the length , but " they just flow out of me . "
I do n't mind .
Most of these guys are too lazy to form a complete thought .
A rambling e-mail is better than " u a hottie . "
Michelle says she 'll think about it .
>:-\
Today I get the most starting e-mail yet .
It 's from a guy with the screen name " watchmeontelevision . "
Who could it be ?
Goran Visnjic ?
Al Roker ?
I open it up .
" I must confess that I am currently involved with someone but quite frankly am looking for a girl on the side ....
" As you noticed I have no photo to share but I periodically represent my company on national TV .
I 'll be on [ show you 've never heard of on a minor cable network ] .
My name is [ his full name here ] .
" I suppose on your path to finding Mr. Right I could perhaps be Mr. Right Now .... "
Holy shit .
Did he really use the " Mr. Right Now " line ?
And is he actually trying to leverage his two minutes on an obscure cable - network show into sex with a hot mistress ?
And why did the subject line say " renaissance woman " ?
Is that a new euphemism for slut ?
I know I should have left it there .
But I could n't .
Me : " Intriguing .
What 's it like to be on TV ? "
He asks me to watch him and tell him what I think .
So I TiVo it .
Afterward , I e-mail to ask if he was flirting with the host .
He responds with a cocky e-mail about how the host is n't his type -- but " you seem like you might be my type . "
I shoot back that I 'm not sure it's a good idea : " I feel a bit guilty about borrowing another woman 's man . do you feel guilty ? "
I was hoping to see a hint of remorse , something to humanize him .
He responds : " you know how they say the forbidden fruit is always the best . "
Nope .
No remorse .
I tell him again that I 'm conflicted .
He says meet him this afternoon for a drink , and one of two things will happen : I 'll feel uncomfortable , or I 'll want to meet him later for a nightcap .
I say maybe , but let 's keep e-mailing .
We chat about travel and our favorite foods .
I ask him about the craziest thing he 's ever done .
" Being a business guy who 's ballsy enough to try to be on television , contemplating running for political office " -- wait , did he just say he was contemplating running for political office ? -- " moving to ten states for my job , romantic fantasies .
( oh , that one slipped out -- do you have any fantasies ? ) "
Oh , man .
Here we go .
There 's no way I can show this to Michelle .
She would be mortified .
I should just drop it , but I do n't .
Why ?
To teach this bastard a lesson ?
Because I 'm drunk with power ?
I 'm a beautiful woman .
I can make these miscreants do anything I want .
Revenge ?
Against men who give other men a bad name .
Whatever it is , it 's something male .
I want to take him down .
I respond , " I think food and sex make a nice combo LOL .
Some whipped cream .
Cherries .
Maybe some chocolate syrup . "
I just want to open the door , not get too graphic .
TV guy says , " I like your fantasies involving food and sex ....
My fantasies are a bit more risque than that , so maybe I should hold off until you know me better . "
I write , " Send them to me .
nothing can shock me . "
A total setup .
He writes back , " Let 's start with the tamest version of my most common fantasy -- taking you to a strip club on amateur night ( although there is nothing amateur about your photos ! )
I 'd like to see you strip for other men , and as we 're entering the club you have on a long fur coat and you 're wearing stiletto heels , but underneath the coat I know you 've got on little else .... "
It 's a well - crafted , highly detailed account that stretches a good two pages .
" ... You walk out onstage wearing a lacy black bra from which your breasts are spilling out , and it barely covers your nipples .
You have on a black thong ....
You are almost rubbing your breasts and your crotch in the faces of the men in the front row .... you end their agony and rip off your bra and thong , and your gorgeous , naked body is out there for all to see ....
I know you 're turned on because your nipples are so hard .... "
It continues with a graphic description of things she does to the audience .
Then he concludes : " ... if you 'd like to continue the fantasy by telling me how you 'd react ... "
Okay .
This has gone into unsettling territory .
I have to end it .
I take the offensive .
" I found your fantasy disturbing on many levels .
It made me feel dirty , but not in a good way .
I felt like you were exhibiting me to other men like a piece of meat .
I am not a piece of meat .
I am not a prostitute ....
I know famous people get away with a lot because of their fame .
But i think its best if we end our conversations here . "
I feel gleeful about punishing this guy .
Though a little bit like a douchebag in my own right .
As it happens , I have been having a simultaneous e-mail exchange with another sketchy character .
This is a guy who , in his opening e-mail , said he was a " BAD boy . "
Capitalized .
I ask him what makes him bad .
He says he 'll do things that would take my breath away .
I ask him for details .
He writes : " after the nice dinner and the club ... and after turning u on with my nice attitude and sexy thaughts , we will rush to my place where I 'll begin by kissing ur sexy lips ... kissing my way down your stomach ... and then your inner thighs ... [ increasingly graphic description here of the licking ] also ... i really want to see more photos . "
I write back : " I 'm afraid there 's been a terrible misunderstanding .
When I said I wanted details of how you 'd take my breath away , I meant details such as the type of flowers you 'd send me , the candlelit restaurant you 'd take me to , et cetera . "
He responds : " it all started with a dinner and a night at the club .
i just did n't give u details about how romantic the dinner was .... no photo ? "
This guy is wonderfully oblivious .
As if he'd only thrown in a description of the tablecloth before the graphic licking it would have been okay .
But that 's it .
No more of this nonsense .
No more setting guys up and then smacking them down .
What am I ? Fourteen ?
Or Chris Hansen from Dateline ?
I can't be wasting my time on this stuff when I have to find Michelle a boyfriend .
I feel guilty enough to write a softening note to the TV guy -- who had apologized for making me feel dirty .
I write that I overreacted but added that I still could n't bring myself to cheat with him .
I send it off .
Then I noticed I signed the note " A. J. " Fuck !
I am dumb .
I 'm dumber than an aspiring politician who sends dirty e-mail fantasies over the Internet .
A week or so later , he e-mails Michelle again .
He addresses her as " A. J. " and begs her to " come out an play . "
I do n't respond .
:-)
Michelle has another off - line date , and this time I make sure to tell him to meet her inside the bar .
It 's the smiley , shaggy - haired rocker .
She 's giving him a chance .
In a last - minute panic attack out of Three 's Company , I call Michelle to tell her she went to a Super Bowl party .
I had e-mailed him how fun the party was before I found out she got sick and had skipped it in real life .
Again , I wait with my cell phone in hand for the postdate update .
" It was pretty good , " she says .
" Just pretty good ? "
" It was great .
He 's very sweet . "
I feel giddy enough to do an actual fist pump .
I 'm investing a lot in this guy .
He 's my discovery .
He 's my stand - in .
I had been worried that Michelle 's online personality would be too different from the way she acts in real life .
She 's usually much shyer than the hybrid we 've created .
What if he suspects something fishy ?
But no , Michelle told me she actually made herself act less shy to conform to her online self .
" When I got there , he said , ' What do you think ? '
And I made him turn around in a circle before I said , ' Not bad . ' "
I 'm psyched .
I 'm Henry friggin' Higgins .
Michelle does n't yet know if the chemistry is there , but the rocker is definitely worth a second date .
I hang up , and my giddiness soon wears off .
It 's replaced by sadness .
A weird sadness .
Almost melancholy , like something out of a Goethe novel .
I realize it 's because I 'm vicariously experiencing the feelings of a crush , the excitement , the possibility , both on Michelle 's part and the rocker's .
I 'd forgotten that feeling .
And it 's bittersweet , because I know that I can't experience that sensation firsthand .
I love being married -- I love its depth and comfort -- but I miss the crush .
Unless you happen to be Mr. watchmeontelevision , you do n't get to feel the rush of the crush .
I 'm jealous of the longhaired rocker .
:-\
The next day , Michelle pulls up a chair to my computer to go over that day 's haul .
A whole bunch of e-mails .
One cheese ball has written , " I know that you probably get tons of emails from dudes trying to use coy pickup lines .
But I do n't care about that .
I wanna know if you 're beautiful on the inside . "
This is about as believable as a leak to Judith Miller .
But he 's right about one thing :
She gets lots of dudes complimenting her looks .
Her pretty eyes , pretty smile , pretty dimples .
She 's been called the entire " attractive " entry of the thesaurus : " captivating , " " luminescent , " " radiant . "
" How many of them do you think read the profile ? "
Michelle asks me .
I laugh and turn to look at her .
She keeps her eyes on the screen .
We click on a thirty - four - year - old who describes his job as international investigator for a corporation -- whatever that means .
Michelle looks at his photo .
" If we have kids , they 'll have huge chins , " she says .
" Why ? "
" Because I have a big chin , " she says .
I stare at her chin .
It 's not big .
It 's not even half the size of Reese Witherspoon's .
Now , I 'm sure Redbook has run a thousand articles about how even Gisele has insecurities about her body .
But beautiful women do n't confess it to men so much .
Maybe Michelle is starting to see me as a fellow woman .
Disturbing .
The chin issue notwithstanding , a couple of days later Michelle goes on a date with the international investigator .
I get the cell - phone call .
" How 'd it go ? "
" It was just okay . "
That 's Michelle 's equivalent of " disastrous . "
A date with Muqtada al - Sadr would be " just okay . "
" What happened ? "
" I was really self - conscious , " she says .
" He stared at me the whole time .
I could n't even look him in the eyes . "
The next night , a second date with the rocker , at a Thai restaurant .
I wait for the call .
It comes too early , just ninety minutes after the date .
" He 's nice , but there 's no chemistry , I think . "
I 'm crushed .
I thought there was a chance .
I can help her write the notes , I can pick the guys , but I can't control that damn chemistry .
Maybe she 'll find some chemistry with Ted from Long Island , the one with eight siblings .
He 's scheduled for next week .
And so is " Loveable Hal . "
I know she 'll find it with someone .
Not just because the e-mails from interested men keep flooding in , unabated .
But because of the men themselves .
The only thing more surprising than the quantity and deviousness of the creeps was the emotional honesty and fragility of the noncreeps .
It 's a side of men that other men just do n't get to see .
It 's enough to bring out the nurturer in anybody .
Which is why I log on to the dating service and do a search for " depressed " and another one for " lonely . "
I find this :
" ummmm , I just turned 28 .
Sorry to say I still live at home with my mother .
Shes getting old and I help her out .
I have NO LIFE .
Go to work and come home , and play video games . "
The next day , Michelle and I write him a note : " I just wanted to say that I think it 's great that you take care of your mom .
There are n't enough nice guys in this world .
I do n't think we 're right for each other ( I do n't believe in long - distance relationships ) , but I think you 'll be a catch for some lucky girl . "
Well , it 's something .
To paraphrase another guy with a double identity , with great beauty comes great responsibility .
