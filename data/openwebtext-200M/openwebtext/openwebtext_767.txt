Several months ago , Rebecca Heyman oversaw the firing of 20 software engineers whose jobs were being moved to China .
She met with the erstwhile employees , described their severance , helped them gather their personal effects , and politely ushered them out of the building .
On the surface it sounds like a typical downsizing -- hardly uncommon in an era of offshoring and mergers and acquisitions .
What made this situation somewhat odd , however , is that prior to the fateful day , Heyman had never met these workers .
That 's because she 's a consultant with TriNet , a Bay Area firm that serves as a de facto human resources department for some 1,500 small companies .
Although the bulk of Heyman 's firing work consists of helping companies structure severance and document information in order to limit their legal liability , she often goes further , coaching managers on how to steel themselves , and , in some circumstances , firing employees herself .
" I work with some folks who have never fired someone before , " says Heyman , who at 31 is one of TriNet 's younger consultants .
" They look to me to pull the trigger . "
Welcome to the final frontier of human resources : the outsourced termination .
The popularity of HR outsourcing and consulting , which was in its infancy only a decade ago , has exploded in recent years .
Worldwide , the industry now accounts for $ 88.7 billion in spending , according to IDC ( NYSE : IDC ) , a research firm in Framingham , Massachusetts .
Big companies are responsible for much of that spending , but small companies that have traditionally relied on professional employer organizations , or PEOs , to manage payroll are increasingly outsourcing more complex tasks such as recruiting , performance reviews , and , yes , terminations .
Rebecca Heyman 's boss , TriNet founder Martin Babinec , says that demand for these services is growing so fast that he now does as much revenue in a given quarter as he did in all of 2002 , when he booked $ 22 million .
Outsourced terminations come at a time when a host of employers have been experimenting with new ways to fire people .
When Oracle purchased PeopleSoft in 2005 , for example , Oracle ( NASDAQ : ORCL ) sent notices to some 5,000 employees by overnight mail .
Packages were delivered to workers ' homes on a Saturday ; inside the envelopes , employees found either a job offer or a severance package .
Radio
Shack tried a different approach last year when it laid off roughly 400 employees by e-mail .
" These stories are perverse , " acknowledges Kevin Grauman , founder of Emportal , an HR - related software company in Walnut Creek , California .
But companies are so fearful of wrongful termination lawsuits that they conclude they can't afford to be personal .
Cold seems careful .
In an outsourced firing , a consultant typically meets with a CEO to script and rehearse the big conversation .
On the day the ax falls , the consultant sits in on the meeting , taking notes and making sure the manager stays on message .
" We 're sitting right there , " says JP Magill , co-founder of the Achilles Group , a Houston company that provides termination and other HR services .
" And our client has exactly what they need to say written out verbatim . "
In cases where the entrepreneur needs to fire an early employee or a co-founder -- a circumstance common among fast - growing companies that are moving to professional management -- Magill says it 's best if Achilles handles the firing alone , with the boss in another room .
" There can be an emotional barrier that neither person can get past , " Magill explains .
" At that point , you need to isolate the organization from the termination . "
Recently , an Achilles consultant named Stephanie Van Lue was asked by a company president to fire his own sister - in - law .
In breaking the news , Van Lue stressed that the decision had nothing to do with the family relationship and that the company was obligated to treat her the same way as it treated other nonperforming employees .
When the woman complained to her brother - in - law , he referred her back to Van Lue .
" That was his way of separating himself from [ the decision ] , " she says .
After three phone calls with Van Lue , the employee accepted a severance package .
Not everyone is a fan of this new approach .
" Outsourcing firing is a bad idea , " says Dan Weinfurter , co-founder and CEO of Capital H Group , a recruiting firm based in Chicago .
People who are fired talk , he warns , and increasingly , they blog .
If you 're perceived as being cold - hearted or simply clueless , you 'll find it harder to recruit new employees .
For their part , firing specialists say a manager should never defer entirely to them , but that it does n't hurt to have a consultant in the room in case the manager starts to get into trouble .

WASHINGTON — Gerardo Chavez knew how to get coveted posts at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
He was a special supervisory special agent and attaché in Caracas , Venezuela .
He also knew how to make money illegally .
On Friday a federal judge in Alexandria , Va. , sentenced him to 7 ½ years in prison for taking kickbacks for a no - bid U.S. government contract for defective armor 4 - wheel drive vehicles in South America and the Carribean .
According to court documents , Chavez , 46 , of Clifton , Va. , served in Venezuela from 2003 to 2007 .
During that period , he used his position to steer $ 2.8 million in “ sole source U.S. Government contracts ” to a Caracas - based firm Blincar for the armored vehicles , the U.S. Attorney ’s office said .
In turn , he got a $ 172,000 kickback from the owner of Blincar and was hoping to get $ 87,000 more before the crime was uncovered by the FBI and Homeland Security , authorities said .
The FBI eventually conducted ballistic tests on the armored cars and found the armoring to be defective , authorities charged .
Consequently , the government said , 45 armored vehicles were replaced at a cost of more than $ 5 million .
Authorities said that in addition to the kickbacks , Chavez also received about $ 250,000 in unreported funds outside of his salary .
He wired that money and the kickback funds to California in his brother - in - laws ’s name to purchase and remodel a home in Clifton , Va. , authorities alleged .

Chemists in Germany and Switzerland have discovered the first stable complex of calcium ( I ) - a highly unusual structure for a metal whose chemistry is normally dominated by the +2 oxidation state .
Matthias Westerhausen and colleagues at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena have found that two calcium ( I ) ions can be stabilised by inserting an arene group between them , forming a stable structure the team have termed an ’ inverse sandwich ’ complex .
This kind of complex has been seen before with group three metals such as gallium and indium , but not with group two metals .
While other alkaline earth metals , including magnesium and zinc , have been complexed in the +1 oxidation state before , the ’ inverse sandwich ’ structure represents a very different way of stabilising these metal ( I ) ions , says Westerhausen .
’ The Mg( I ) and Zn( I ) compounds synthesised recently have relied on large ligands to protect a metal - metal bond , ’ Westerhausen explains .
’ Instead of using large ligands to shield the metal atoms , what you can do is find a molecule with an empty orbital of the right energy to accept an electron from the calcium atom , ’ Westerhausen adds .
’ The first and second ionisation energies of calcium are very different , and it happens that the pi-star orbital of triphenylbenzene is just the right energy to accept only the first electron from a calcium atom .
What you end up with is two calcium ( I ) ions , and the arene in the middle with a 2 - charge from the two unpaired electrons . ’
Westerhausen discovered the novel complex accidentally , while researching calcium analogues of Grignard reagents .
The group had made the magnesium Grignard in the normal way , reacting ( triphenyl ) phenyl bromide with magnesium metal .
’ But when we did the same thing with calcium , we got a completely different compound - which was halide - free , and paramagnetic , ’ Westerhausen explains .
Being paramagnetic meant the complex had some unpaired electrons - a crucial indicator of calcium ( I ) - which prompted a deeper investigation of the new complex to establish its structure and properties .
Richard Layfield , a main - group chemist from the University of Manchester , UK , thinks that Westerhausen has done a ’ fantastic job ’ of characterising the complex .
’ The fact that they can even handle the compound is impressive [ given its extreme sensitivity to oxygen ] , but they have isolated it and proved that it ’s not calcium ( II ) with a range of experiments .
It ’s a really nicely rounded off piece of work , ’ Layfield adds .
Westerhausen wants to extend this idea to the heavier alkaline earth metals , such as strontium and barium .
’ These metals have lower ionisation potentials , so we need to find the right arene pi-system to match up with the energy .
I think magnesium is too hard to stabilise this way , but with the heavier metals it should be possible . ’

Tila Tequila to Adopt After She Makes " Another Billion "
" Sometimes I think , like , let 's just run away from Hollywood and adopt a son , and do my own thing .
But then I realize , you know what ?
I want to make at least another billion dollars before I adopt children so I can focus on them .
Like , just move to an island and give them everything . "
" I had a dog , but I had to give him to ( my ) best friend , because he did not like to travel at all .
And I do n't like little Chihuahuas or poodles or those little dogs those girls carry around .
I like bigger dogs , and they get too big for me , because I am small , so I can't walk them or anything . "

Amidst all the coverage of the new iTunes pricing structure - and the fact that purchased songs will be DRM - free from now on - not many reporters pointed out ( there are exceptions , of course ) that Apple is actually charging 30 cents for DRM removal from old songs .
Yes , you can burn the songs to a CD and import them back into iTunes , but the quality of the tracks will deteriorate .
What 's important here is the fact that Apple is now basically admitting ( remember that long anti-DRM note from Steve Jobs ? ) that DRM was a mistake , but they still want you to pay them for it .
I do n't know about you , but I do n't like paying for others ' mistakes .
A modified version of this laser rifle created to dazzle enemies by the US Air Force has been adapted by the Department of Justice to inflict pain from a distance ( Image : US Air Force )
The research arm of the US Department of Justice is working on two portable non-lethal weapons that inflict pain from a distance using beams of laser light or microwaves , with the intention of putting them into the hands of police to subdue suspects .
The two devices under development by the civilian National Institute of Justice both build on knowledge gained from the Pentagon ’s controversial Active Denial System ( ADS ) – first demonstrated in public last year , which uses a 2 - metre beam of short microwaves to heat up the outer layer of a person ’s skin and cause pain .
‘ Reduced injuries ’
Like the ADS , the new portable devices will also heat the skin , but will have beams only a few centimetres across .
They are designed to elicit what the Pentagon calls a “ repel response ” – a strong urge to escape from the beam .
Advertisement
A spokesperson for the National Institute for Justice likens the effect of the new devices to that of “ blunt trauma ” weapons such as rubber bullets , “ But unlike blunt trauma devices , the injury should not be present .
This research is looking to reduce the injuries to suspects , ” they say .
Existing blunt trauma weapons can break ribs or even kill , making alternatives welcome .
Yet ADS has recorded problems too – out of several thousand tests on human subjects there were two cases of second - degree burns .
Dazzle and burn
The NIJ ’s laser weapon has been dubbed Personnel Halting and Stimulation Response – PHaSR – and resembles a bulky rifle .
It was created in 2005 by a US air force agency to temporarily dazzle enemies ( see image , right ) , but the addition of a second , infrared laser makes it able to heat skin too .
The NIJ is testing the PHaSR in various scenarios , which may include prison situations as well as law enforcement .
The NIJ ’s portable microwave - based weapon is less developed .
Currently a tabletop prototype with a range of less than a metre , a backpack - sized prototype with a range of 15 metres will be ready next year , a spokesperson says .
The truly portable mini-ADS could prove the more useful , as microwaves penetrate clothing better than the infra-red beam , which is most effective on exposed skin .
Although the spokesman says : “ In LEC [ Law Enforcement and Corrections ] use there is always a little bit of skin to target . ”
Torture concerns
The effect of microwave beams on humans has been investigated for years , but there is little publicly available research on the effects of PHaSR - type lasers on humans .
The attraction of using a laser is that it can be less bulky than a microwave device .
Human rights groups say that equipping police with such weapons would add to the problems posed by existing “ non-lethals ” such as Tasers .
Security expert Steve Wright at Leeds Metropolitan University describes the new weapons as “ torture at the touch of a button ” .
“ We have grave concerns about the deployment and use of any such devices , which have the potential to be used for torture or other ill treatment , ” says Amnesty International ’s arms control researcher Helen Hughes , adding that all research into their effects should be made public .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Troubled financial giants getting cash infusions from the U.S. government owed executives more than $ 40 billion for deferred pay and pensions as of the end of 2007 , the Wall Street Journal reported in an analysis .
The exterior of the world headquarters for Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated is seen in New York , May 19 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson / Files
The sums owed are mostly for special executive pensions and deferred compensation , including bonuses , for prior years , said the paper .
The Journal cited investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc , which owes its executives $ 11.8 billion ; JPMorgan Chase & Co , which has a payment of $ 8.5 billion pending ; and Morgan Stanley , which owes between $ 10 billion and $ 12 billion .
A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman confirmed the accuracy of the report .
Goldman Sachs said the “ vast majority ” of the $ 11.8 billion cited was paid out to executives earlier this year .
Beyond that , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan Chase declined to comment on their compensation plans .
Criticism of executive pay has gained momentum this election year , with presidential candidates from both major parties lashing out over rich payouts for CEOs of companies that have suffered big losses in the U.S. housing market bust and ensuing credit crisis .
As a result , the government has sought to rein in executive pay at banks getting federal money as part of the Bush administration ’s $ 700 billion bailout program .
Across the industry , bank executives and directors are discussing how they will handle the need to remain competitive in paying top people without incurring the anger of lawmakers and regulators .
People familiar with the situation inside several of the top U.S. banks told Reuters most compensation decisions will not be made until next month .
These people also say the firms still intend to compensate valued employees .
“ The government cutting or controlling pay is a non- starter .
Bank heads think it ’s dangerous and it sets a bad precedent , ” one bank insider said .
Goldman , Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have set aside $ 20 billion as compensation in the first three quarters , with two - thirds typically earmarked for year - end performance bonuses .
These amounts were put in reserve before Aug. 31 , ahead of Lehman ’s collapse and last month ’s Treasury intervention .
Compensation is accrued throughout the year and usually equals 45 percent to 55 percent of revenue .
For instance , nine banks paid out an estimated $ 50 billion in bonuses in 2007 , based on the total compensation expense for the companies and assuming that , for investment banks , about 60 percent of total compensation was allocated for bonuses , while commercial banks allocated about 20 percent for that purpose .
The total of these obligations at some firms exceed what they owe in pensions to their entire workforces , the Journal said .
Cognitive rehabilitation after a serious brain injury or stroke can help the mind in much the same way that physical therapy helps the body , according to a new meta - analysis .
Because the data suggest that treatment may work best when tailored to age , injury , symptoms , and time since injury , the findings may help establish evidence - based treatment guidelines .
A full report is in the January issue of Neuropsychology , which is published by the American Psychological Association .
Researchers at the University of South Alabama and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte analyzed and updated the data found in systematic reviews , published in 2000 * and 2005 ** , of several hundred studies of cognitive rehabilitation .
The researchers took those studies whose samples and methods were most amenable to rigorous statistical techniques and documented the extent to which various treatments improve the language , attention , memory and other cognitive problems that appear after acquired brain injury ( such as from trauma , stroke or loss of oxygen - in other words , not congenital ) .
The meta - analysis examined 97 articles , comprising 115 studied treatment samples and 45 control samples .
These samples collectively included 2,014 individuals who underwent cognitive rehabilitation after brain injury and 870 individuals in a variety of control conditions .
The authors of the initial reviews had concluded there was enough evidence to generally support the use of a variety of rehabilitative treatments .
To develop specific treatment guidelines , this new analysis documented the extent to which treatment type and timing , origin of the injury , recovery level , and participant age affected the odds of success .
Given the patterns they found , the authors offered initial treatment guidelines :
Generally , it is better to start treating patients as early as possible , rather than waiting for a more complete neurological recovery .
Even older patients ( age 55 and up ) may benefit from cognitive rehabilitation , particularly if the brain injury is due to stroke .
Clinicians should focus their efforts on direct cognitive skills training in specific cognitive domains ( such as attention or visuospatial processing ) .
More holistic , non-targeted interventions appear to be less effective .
Especially if they were treated soon after the event , language training helped older people after stroke with aphasia , problems producing and / or comprehending language .
However , language training was still effective , just not as much , when it started more than a year after the stroke .
Attention training helped people with acquired brain injury and seemed to work best with younger patients less than a year after injury .
It was the most specific treatment , improving nothing but attention .
Visuospatial training helped stroke patients with visuospatial neglect , the inability to respond or orient to something shown on the side opposite to the site of the injury .
Visuospatial training also tended to improve performance in other cognitive domains .
Memory treatment did not produce clear results .
Nor did comprehensive treatments that attempted to treat cognitive problems holistically .
Other specific findings emerged .
For one thing , patients treated less than a year after injury did better than those treated more than a year later .
For another , older patients tended to improve more after stroke than younger patients improved after traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
However , because strokes are more common in old age and TBI is more common in youth , further research is needed to disentangle the roles of age and injury type .
Thus , in the field of cognitive rehabilitation , one size does not fit all .
Additional research should fill remaining gaps in understanding the effectiveness of and optimizing conditions for specific interventions .

Bob Chapman | February 14 , 2009
We have been fortunate enough to make some important calls over the past ten years .
The top of the stock market in early April of 2000 ; the beginning of the gold bull market in June 2000 ; 9/11 in November ten months before it happened ; the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars ; the beginning of the real estate bubble ; the top of that market in June of 2005 ; the beginning of the subprime fiasco in 2006 and the beginning of the commercial real estate freeze .
We also forecast the terrible financial conditions facing states and the freezing up of insurance and the municipal bond market .
We called the recession in February 2007 and told readers to get out of the market at 14,000 .
That ’s with the exception of gold and silver and oil shares .
The recession was right on schedule .
The depression that began two weeks ago happened quicker than we had anticipated , but it is here and now .
We predicted a fall in consumption , which we estimate at 71 % of GDP , a rise in savings , which is now 2.8 % , and a fall in debt service not only in real estate , but also in loans and credit card loans .
Massive losses continue probably some additional $ 40 trillion from just 9/08 to 12/09 alone in wealth destruction .
Those who follow and live off the Illuminist line favor a large , deep stimulus and if that does n’t work than a bigger one in a year .
What America needs is job growth , but that cannot happen in any meaningful way until we erect tariffs on goods and services .
America has never been able too and will never be able to compete with cheap labor .
One of the solutions passed four years ago was the repatriation of profits from offshore tax havens by transnational Illuminist conglomerates .
They returned $ 35 billion at a 5 - 1/ 4 % tax rate instead of paying the normal 33 % .
Our Congress saw fit to reward their masters under the guise of creating jobs .
Few if any jobs were created .
It was just a giant money laundering exercise .
This solution is again running around Congress , only this time the amount is $ 550 billion at a 5 % tax rate .
A reward for the people who in part were responsible for the situation we now find ourselves in .
We have a better idea .
Let ’s have legislation demanding the funds be repatriated and let ’s charge normal taxation of 33 % and force these ingrates to use the funds for job creation .
We ’d have taxes for our debt services and funds to get our nation underway again .
America has to come to grips with the fact it is bankrupt .
We saw this in the early 1980s , and in the early 1990s and again in 2002 - 2003 .
Finally it is here again and moving bad assets off bank balance sheets is n’t going to work this time .
This time the Illuminists have gone too far , and they are well aware of that .
What we are experiencing has been done many times before in history and it has always been unsuccessful .
The problem is that in the past these conspirators have been allowed to live on .
This time it will be different .
The elitists have used the same destruction of capital in this depression as they did in the 1930s via a profligate , irresponsible monetary policy .
That is endless and mindless increases of money and credit and zero interest rates .
Falling interest rates usually cause a weaker dollar .
The dollar has topped out of its rally and is making a slow downturn , which would have otherwise been quicker had not other major nations agreed to drop their rates to zero and increase money and credit as well .
For the time being this cooperation is buying time for the international financial system and the dollar , but it is doomed to failure .
The lowering of interest rates is not a cure for deflation , but poison for the economy and they reinforce deflation .
It is interesting to note that under its Charter the Fed cannot be party to monetization of public debt under their charter , but they do so anyway , because Congress authorized it .
That is the purchase of Treasury bonds in the open market and using them as collateral for its note and deposit liabilities after the fact .
The bottom line is this forces capital to disappear into other investment avenues , such as gold .
The dynamics of lower interest rates are continuing and totally injurious to the monetary structure .
Throw in the bailouts and you ’ve created a monster .
That is why gold and silver is your only avenue of escape .
The point of no return was passed in June of 2002 , and that is when the issuance of money and credit began to grow seriously .
The result is the banking system is already in a state of collapse and the dollar is sure to follow .
Looking back at monetary history we know that zero interest rates is pure insanity .
The Fed , banking , and Wall Street know this and this helps us to conclude that none of this happed via incompetence or chance , but by deliberate intent .
In the early 1920s the Weimar Republic was hit by hyperinflation that lasted for several years .
Germany , in moving into the 1930s , then experienced deflation .
We began deflation five years ago in 2004 .
That was kept under control with increases in money and credit .
The Fed was joined about six months later by most central banks .
The vast increases of money and credit continued along with monetization , so we should see the beginnings of hyperinflation soon .
That should last at least 2 - 3 years .
That will be followed by deflation and deeper depression .
As the trillions in debt is liquidated it will be smothered by the hyperinflation and substantially higher gold and silver prices .
The banking system has been broken .
The dollar falls next versus other currencies and gold , then all currencies collapse versus gold .
What we are seeing in banking is no solution .
The banks have to be purged and allowed to fail .
Until that happens there will be no solution .
Only a return to a gold standard can regain the confidence and trust of people worldwide .
The concept of good and bad banks under present circumstances is ridiculous - moronic .
The very concept is mad .
Our situation is worse than in the 1930s or in the early 1990s in Scandinavia .
The problem under our circumstances is that both banks are bad , because our currency is worthless without gold backing .
If we are correct , and we believe we are , the stimulus package and TARP , plus all the other bailouts are not going to work .
This so - called solution is just more of the same , but more of it .
When you stop to think of it how can a bankrupt nation with a fiat currency save a banking system that is bankrupt as well ?
The solution to this is a simple .
Back the dollar with gold and set the official price at $ 2,000 an ounce , although it may be trading at $ 3,000 in the marketplace .
The US Mint would then vastly increase the number of gold coins available for purchase .
Of course if the treasury has little or no gold they cannot do this , and the whole system collapses .
Otherwise , with gold backing , capital would flow to America .
Such a currency would allow nominal interest rates and would draw users and prices would remain stable .
Eventually all countries would do likewise , set a world gold standard , and tariffs that suited their circumstances .
If a nation was short on gold or had none , they ’d have to sell assets to others to accumulate gold .
If the forgoing is not adopted the world will continue to plunge into monetary chaos .
Revolutions would take place as starvation and warfare stalked the land .
We expect the worst , because no change has taken place in Washington .
We have virtually the same purchased and compromised Congress .
The President ’s new advisors will bring about the same results we have seen over the past eight years .
That is the grand push for a world currency and a world government .
These are all the same characters along with banking and Wall Street that caused these problems in the first place and supposedly are finding solutions to our dilemma .
In finality , if we do not take our government back from these evil , miscreants we are doomed .
Your solution , as we have pointed out so often , is to prepare .
Get rid of credit card debt .
Purchase a water filter , freeze - dried and dehydrated foods , be able to defend your home and family , with extra assets buy gold and silver coins and shares .
If you can , still try to save the system from within .
If we cannot , you know what the alternative is .
Due to the pending stimulus package and another probably $ 2 trillion stimulus package in 2010 , the bottom of the housing market wo n’t be hit until 2012 or even later .
Moody ’s has downgraded 2,446 different classes of RMBS , Residential Mortgage Backed Securities .
ALT - A loans originated in the second half of 2007 will experience 25.5 % losses of original balance , versus 23.9 % of the first half of 2007 deals , 22.1 % for the second half of 2006 and 17.1 % for the first half of 2006 deals .
The CDOs and SIVs are soon going to be written off and that could cost $ 2 trillion .
It will take at least until 2017 to put a new credit system in place .
It will take years beyond that for the Fed and the Treasury to sell off the toxic waste .
By the time next year ’s stimulus package is unveiled , the Dow should be trading between 3,800 and 5,500 .
That is bad , but what is worse is that pension funds about 80 % funded , will be 40 % to 50 % funded .
We ask how do they pay the promised benefits ?
We do n’t think they can and pensions could be cut 40 to 50 percent .
We wrote about this six years ago and called it the pension bomb .
On the municipal level the situation will be much worse .
Some states , such as California , which is bankrupt , may not pay anything at all .
Calpers and the other state fund are on the edge of insolvency .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ’s efforts to restore trust and confidence in our markets have fallen on deaf ears .
We still do not know all of what he intends to do with $ 350 billion in TARP funds .
What we do know for sure is that he wants to give financial firms as much of it as possible .
He wants a repeat of TARP I , the theft of taxpayer funds to bail out his masters .
His plan entails a price of $ 2.75 trillion and the ‘ what he calls ’ nationalization of the banking system , which in reality is the consolidation and further privatization of the banking system - a tight control by the privately owned Fed on as much of the banking system as possible .
The stimulus plan to create more debt to spend our way into prosperity is being passed simultaneously , as the decision on how TARP is to be spent .
First Mr. Geithner wants a $ 1 trillion “ public private investment fund ” to value so - called troubled assets , also known as toxic garbage .
He wants to leverage Treasury funds of $ 100 billion up to $ 1 trillion in loans to consumers and businesses and that would require lenders who are loaned those funds to actually lend them , not hoard them as they are presently .
$ 600 billion would go to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to insure more failing loans and to purchase CDOs and SIVs , plus $ 50 billion for foreclosure prevention by rewriting loans , so people will have lower payments so their loans wo n’t go into foreclosure .
Plus , an expansion of SBA loans .
The wealthy of Wall Street and the City of London via this “ public private investment fund ” will cherry - pick the best loans for undervalued prices .
They ’ll be purchased for $ 0.10 to $ 0.30 on the dollar .
Billionaires will then quickly become trillionaires .
These will be the donors to our president the “ friends of Barak , ” FOB if you please .
That leaves the rest of the real garbage to be held by the taxpayers .
This is the price we have to pay to keep deadbeats in their homes .
People who should have never had loans in the first place .
The current Geithner proposal for this $ 1 trillion “ public private investment fund ” is to guarantee that the value of the toxic waste will not fall below a designated floor value .
The anointed FOB buyers will be indemnified against loss of any consequence .
In other words the FOB ’s get sweetheart deals .
For this the taxpayers get nothing but the garbage .
If these toxic assets fall below the floor price the public pays for it .
It is a terrible deal for the American public .
What should be done is that all these banks , brokers and industrial companies should be allowed to fail .
All of the equity and unsecured debt should be wiped out and then they should be really nationalized .
They can then be resold at a later date to new shareholders .
The elitists and politicians do not want that because then they wo n’t be able to steal these companies .
These crooks are hiding the values of assets , some of which are totally worthless .
If we have a bad bank all the garbage will come off the balance sheets of Goldman , Morgan , the other money center legacy banks , Wall Street , insurance companies , private equity dealers and corporate gamblers like GMAC and GE .
Geithner intends to buy these assets using our money at close to par ( perhaps at 80 % ) and then rebill it to the private part of the private - public partnership at $ 0.15 on the dollar with a quarantee against loss .
A deal made in hell .
This is why the Fed , banks and Wall Street want the mark - to - market accounting standards repealed .
How can the insiders get huge bonuses and pay large dividends if the toxic waste is removed at its real value of $ 0.15 on the dollar ?
The postscript is no matter what they do it will be a disaster for taxpayers .
Each plan for the past 20 months has been a loser , because the people who created the disaster are the ones supposedly fixing it .
You must keep in mind there is no intention to fix anything .
It is to enrich the rich and destroy the system so that we can have a World Currency and One - World Government .
The hopes of the public have been bashed many times .
The return to normality has n’t occurred in 20 months .
If fact , the situation is much worse .
The elitists have hit a stonewall .
Few believe them anymore .
There is no trust left .
There has been much talk by fane - stream media shills , economists and newsletter writers to the effect that deflationary forces have taken over our economy and that any impact from inflationary forces is behind us or is rapidly waning .
Those that advocate this view either do not understand the end game of the Illuminati , or they are disinformation operatives for the US government and its Puppet Masters , the evil , megalomaniacal , satanic , trillionaire sociopaths who comprise our shadow government .
The Fed has no intention of letting deflation take over until there is no possible way to stop it , which could take as long as two to three years from now .
If deflation takes over , then America goes immediately bankrupt and the dollar is toast .
That would end the gravy train of salaries , bonuses , dividends , commissions and spreads which are lining the pockets of the Puppet Masters and their henchmen , the forces of " Chaos , " who are now using taxpayer bailout money in substitution for profits which are no longer being generated by their transnational financial and corporate institutions which they have intentionally and malevolently bankrupted to collapse the world economy and to pave the way for world government .
Ron Paul to Bill Maher : America 's War on Drugs must end David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday February 21 , 2009
Print This Email This Congressman Ron Paul is the most conservative , grandfatherly man to ever be admired by America 's marijuana enthusiasts .
On Friday night 's episode of HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher , he reminded those who may have been suffering an impaired short - term memory at that late hour why , exactly , they should like him .
Speaking live from Clute , Texas , the libertarian - leaning Republican did what few other members of Congress will and openly called for the United States ' War on Drugs to be abolished .
" What about when FDR came to office in ' 33 , " asked Maher .
" One of the first things he did was repeal prohibition .
He said we can't afford this anymore .
Well , we have prohibition in this country .
...
When he was making radical changes he said look , we 're serious now .
We 're going to make serious changes and people like liquor . "
" Well , in this country , people like pot , " said Maher to a wave of cheers and applause .
" If we ended that prohibition , that would be a giant pooling of money . "
" I do n't like pot , " said the congressman .
" But I hate the drug war , so I would repeal all of prohibition .
But , I would n't even bother taxing it .
People have the right in a free country to make important decisions on their own lives .
If they want to make mistakes , they can .
They just can't come crawling to the government to get bailed out or taken care of if they get sick .
" I believe in freedom of choice in all that we do , as long as the individual never hurts anybody else .
So that means I would get rid of all the federal laws .
I would dispose with the drug war .
We 're spending tens , if not hundreds of billions of dollars on this , then we march into places like California , override state laws , arrest sick people and put them in prison . "
" It makes no sense whatsoever , " he insisted .
" Amen , stoner , " joked Maher .

In Two lessons for the price of one , Assaf over at Labnotes referred to No Wonder Enterprise Software Sucks ^H^H^H^H^H
Is Low Quality .
He quoted the following passage :
My point is that the architectural complexity of these applications inhibit a person ’s understanding of the code .
. . .
Without actually doing anything , applications are becoming too complex to understand , build , and maintain .
The original piece of writing about the low quality of enterprise software by Travis Jensen is worth a read , but Assaf ’s own brief take on the matter is all I need here :
Every layer makes perfect sense in isolation .
The cracks start showing when you pile them up into a mega- architecture , and you can clearly see how some of the layers cancel each other out .
Object Oriented Programming
One of the oft - cited benefits is the ability to “ reuse code ” without having to rewrite it .
This is accomplished by way of encapsulating code with data in a manner that provides a sort of discrete entity to which one can refer over and over again within a program .
That encapsulation , along with the protection ( that is , protecting the code and data inside an object from contamination by improper access ) that OOP offers , provides other benefits as well .
Among these other benefits is increased sustainability of large , complex projects , with many programmers who need not even be familiar with each others ’ work ( or names , for that matter ) helping to develop the overall project .
Because object oriented design allows a program to be more fully and easily broken down into separate , largely independent chunks than many other programming styles allow , it is easier to specify an API , then assign its implementation to a single team of programmers , and send them off to finish that task .
These groups , in turn , can further break down their own chunks of the overall system into smaller chunks , and hand those sub - chunks off to sub-teams or individuals .
As large , complicated software systems like this evolve over time , they tend to grow in terms of total number of chunks that make up the whole system .
Furthermore , mediocre ( or even downright crappy ) code can flourish within carefully encapsulated and protected classes without ever having to be judged by outside eyes ; that is to say , one does n’t even need anyone outside the team or programmer that developed a single segregated piece of the whole system to view the code , as long as it “ works ” .
Nobody working on any of these individual chunks needs to know anything about the project ’s Big Picture , either .
There is n’t even any particular need to have a unifying architectural style , and with big enough projects , it can quickly become nigh - impossible to impose such a unifying architectural style anyway .
The Pattern
Can we see the pattern yet ?
A while back ( like , two years ago ) , I wrote a consideration of the social effects of OOP on how software has “ advanced ” titled OOP and the death of modularity .
In it , I may have seemed to say the opposite of what I ’ve been implying so far , but the very perspicacious among you may notice this is n’t the case .
In fact , both OOP and the death of modularity and this piece point out basically the same problem , but in different ways : that software is getting bigger and more complicated without actually separating concerns in as meaningful a way as it could — as , in fact , certain older development philosophies ( like “ the Unix philosophy ” ) provided significantly better modularity and significantly reduced complexity .
Of course , I was n’t then , and I ’m not now , saying that object oriented programming is the proximate cause of the ills of bloated enterprise software .
What I ’m saying is that people are the proximate cause — people who do n’t know what the hell they ’re doing .
These people accept all the marketing for OOP , which states that it ’ll make your code more modular and more stable and just generally better .
It wo n’t .
It will help you do good things for your code if you apply it intelligently , and if you do n’t use it even when you should n’t .
OOP still is n’t a silver bullet .
Nor is FP , for that matter .
They ’re just tools that can help when properly applied .
Do n’t make the old mistake of assuming that when you have a hammer , everything ’s a nail .
Sometimes it ’s a hex nut , and you need a different tool .
. . . and do n’t assume that just because you ’re using OOP techniques you do n’t have to get actually good programmers to do the work for you .
As Paul Graham put it :
Object - oriented programming offers a sustainable way to write spaghetti code .
It does n’t force you to do so — but it sure does make spaghetti code a lot more attractive .
OOP did n’t do this to us ; we did it to ourselves .
OOP just held our hats .
How do cells get rid of their garbage ?
One solution is simply to outgrow it : if the rate of synthesis of new components exceeds the rate of accumulation of old ones , then unwanted trash will be diluted out , even without any active clearance .
This is only really possible in exponentially growing populations , however : slowly dividing or postmitotic cells must activate degradative pathways ( e.g. , autophagy and ubiquitin - proteasome ) in order to prevent accumulation of potentially toxic damaged macromolecules and dysfunctional organelles .
In order to degrade a protein , protein complex or organelle , however , one must first be able to get at it — and there are specific cellular components that make this very difficult .
As an example , let ’s consider the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) : it ’s huge ( 120 megaDaltons ) , complex ( >30 protein components ) and topologically challenging ( the pore crosses the nuclear envelope and creates a hole in the process ) .
Many NPC components are n’t in dynamic equilibrium with cytosolic pools , so if we want to turn over any of these proteins we would have to somehow take out the entire NPC , repair the ensuing damage to the membrane , and then either re-insert the NPC ( which I do n’t believe actually happens ) or synthesize a new NPC to restore the lost import / export capacity .
Unfortunately , new nuclear pores are probably only created during mitosis , when the nuclear envelope and topologically connected endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) split up into vesicles that subsequently re-fuse after cell division is complete .
So how do postmitotic cells turn over and degrade NPCs ?
The answer , according to D’Angelo et al. , is that they probably do n’t .
Instead , NPCs get old , and accumulate damage , and eventually stop doing their job :
Age - Dependent Deterioration of Nuclear Pore Complexes Causes a Loss of Nuclear Integrity in Postmitotic Cells
In dividing cells , nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) disassemble during mitosis and reassemble into the newly forming nuclei .
However , the fate of nuclear pores in postmitotic cells is unknown .
Here , we show that NPCs , unlike other nuclear structures , do not turn over in differentiated cells .
While a subset of NPC components , like Nup153 and Nup50 , are continuously exchanged , scaffold nucleoporins , like the Nup107/ 160 complex , are extremely long - lived and remain incorporated in the nuclear membrane during the entire cellular life span .
Besides the lack of nucleoporin expression and NPC turnover , we discovered an age - related deterioration of NPCs , leading to an increase in nuclear permeability and the leaking of cytoplasmic proteins into the nucleus .
Our finding that nuclear leakiness is dramatically accelerated during aging and that a subset of nucleoporins is oxidatively damaged in old cells suggests that the accumulation of damage at the NPC might be a crucial aging event .
The damaged NPCs are no longer effective at actively segregating cytosolic and nuclear proteins ; the resulting “ leakiness ” exemplifies the general principle of age - related loss of fidelity .
This leakiness could be causally connected to aging in several different ways : components targeted to the wrong compartment could have deleterious consequences in their new homes ; damaged NPCs could distort the nuclear envelope in a manner analogous to the effect of lamin mutations ; or a combination of these and other effects could contribute to the transcriptional dysregulation that has been observed in multiple cell types and experimental systems .
This post is the text for an invited after - dinner talk about doing science online , given at the banquet for the Quantum Information Processing 2009 conference , held in Santa Fe , New Mexico , January 12 - 16 , 2009 .
Good evening .
Let me start with a few questions .
How many people here tonight know what a blog is ?
How many people read blogs , say once every week or so , or more often ?
How many people actually run a blog themselves , or have contributed to one ?
How many people read blogs , but wo n’t admit it in polite company ?
Let me show you an example of a blog .
It ’s a blog called What ’s New , run by UCLA mathematician Terence Tao .
Tao , as many of you are probably aware , is a Fields - Medal winning mathematician .
He ’s known for solving many important mathematical problems , but is perhaps best known as the co-discover of the Green - Tao theorem , which proved the existence of arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes .
Tao is also a prolific blogger , writing , for example , 118 blog posts in 2008 .
Popular stereotypes to the contrary , he ’s not just sharing cat pictures with his mathematician buddies .
Instead , his blog is a firehose of mathematical information and insight .
To understand how valuable Tao ’s blog is , let ’s look at a example post , about the Navier - Stokes equations .
As many of you know , these are the standard equations used by physicists to describe the behaviour of fluids , i.e. , inside these equations is a way of understanding an entire state of matter .
The Navier - Stokes equations are notoriously difficult to understand .
People such as Feynman , Landau , and Kolmogorov struggled for years attempting to understand their implications , mostly without much success .
One of the Clay Millenium Prize problems is to prove the existence of a global smooth solution to the Navier - Stokes equations , for reasonable initial data .
Now , this is n’t a talk about the Navier - Stokes equations , and there ’s far too much in Terry Tao ’s blog post for me to do it justice !
But I do want to describe some of what the post contains , just to give you the flavour of what ’s possible in the blog medium .
Tao begins his post with a brief statement explaining what the Clay Millenium Problem asks .
He shares the interesting tidibt that in two spatial dimenions the solution to the problem is known ( ! ) , and asks why it ’s so much harder in three dimensions .
He tells us that the standard answer is turbulence , and explains what that means , but then says that he has a different way of thinking about the problem , in terms of what he calls supercriticality .
I ca n’t do his explanation justice here , but very roughly , he ’s looking for invariants which can be used to control the behaviour of solutions to the equations at different length scales .
He points out that all the known invariants give weaker and weaker control at short length scales .
What this means is that the invariants give us a lot of control over solutions at long length scales , where things look quite regular , but little control at short length scales , where you see the chaotic variation characteristic of turbulence .
He then surveys all the known approaches to proving global existence results for nonlinear partial differential equations — he says there are just three broad approaches – and points out that supercriticality is a pretty severe obstruction if you want to use one of these approaches .
The post has loads more in it , so let me speed this up .
He describes the known invariants for the equations , and what they can be used to prove .
He surveys and critiques existing attempts on the problem .
He makes six suggestions for ways of attacking the problem , including one which may be interesting to some of the people in this audience : he suggests that pseudorandomness , as studied by computer scientists , may be connected to the chaotic , almost random behaviour that is seen in the solutions the Navier - Stokes equations .
The post is filled to the brim with clever perspective , insightful observations , ideas , and so on .
It ’s like having a chat with a top - notch mathematician , who has thought deeply about the Navier - Stokes problem , and who is willingly sharing their best thinking with you .
Following the post , there are 89 comments .
Many of the comments are from well - known professional mathematicians , people like Greg Kuperberg , Nets Katz , and Gil Kalai .
They bat the ideas in Tao ’s post backwards and forwards , throwing in new insights and ideas of their own .
It spawned posts on other mathematical blogs , where the conversation continued .
That ’s just one post .
Terry Tao has hundreds of other posts , on topics like Perelman ’s proof of the Poincare conjecture , quantum chaos , and gauge theory .
Many posts contain remarkable insights , often related to open research problems , and they frequently stimulate wide - ranging and informative conversations in the comments .
That ’s just one blogger .
There are , of course , many other top - notch mathematician bloggers .
Cambridge ’s Tim Gowers , another Fields Medallist , also runs a blog .
Like Tao ’s blog , it ’s filled with interesting mathematical insights and conversation , on topics like how to use Zorn ’s lemma , dimension arguments in combinatorics , and a thought - provoking post on what makes some mathematics particularly deep .
Alain Connes , another Fields Medallist , is also a blogger .
He only posts occasionally , but when he does his posts are filled with interesting mathematical tidbits .
For example , I greatly enjoyed this post , where he talks about his dream of solving one of the deepest problems in mathematics – the problem of proving the Riemann Hypothesis – using non-commutative geometry , a field Connes played a major role in inventing .
Berkeley ’s Richard Borcherds , another Fields Medallist , is also a blogger , although he is perhaps better described as an ex-blogger , as he has n’t updated in about a year .
I ’ve picked on Fields Medallists , in part because at least four of the 42 living Fields Medallists have blogs .
But there are also many other excellent mathematical blogs , including blogs from people closely connected to the quantum information community , like Scott Aaronson , Dave Bacon , Gil Kalai , and many others .
Let me make a few observations about blogging as a medium .
It ’s informal .
It ’s rapid - fire .
Many of the best blog posts contain material that could not easily be published in a conventional way : small , striking insights , or perhaps general thoughts on approach to a problem .
These are the kinds of ideas that may be too small or incomplete to be published , but which often contain the seed of later progress .
You can think of blogs as a way of scaling up scientific conversation , so that conversations can become widely distributed in both time and space .
Instead of just a few people listening as Terry Tao muses aloud in the hall or the seminar room about the Navier - Stokes equations , why not have a few thousand talented people listen in ?
Why not enable the most insightful to contribute their insights back ?
You can also think of blogs as a way of making scientific conversation searchable .
If you type “ Navier - Stokes problem ” into Google , the third hit is Terry Tao ’s blog post about it .
That means future mathematicians can easily benefit from his insight , and that of his commenters .
You might object that the most important papers about the Navier - Stokes problem should show up first in the search .
There is some truth to this , but it ’s not quite right .
Rather , insofar as Google is doing its job well , the ranking should reflect the importance and significance of the respective hits , regardless of whether those hits are papers , blog posts , or some other form .
If you look at this way , it ’s not so surprising that Terry Tao ’s blog post is near the top .
As all of us know , when you ’re working on a problem , a good conversation with an insightful colleague may be worth as much ( and sometimes more ) than reading the classic papers .
Furthermore , as search engines become better personalized , the search results will better reflect your personal needs ; in a search utopia , if Terry Tao ’s blog post is what you most need to see , it ’ll come up first , while if someone else ’s paper on the Navier - Stokes problem is what you most need to see , then that will come up first .
I ’ve started this talk by discussing blogs because they are familiar to most people .
But ideas about doing science in the open , online , have been developed far more systematically by people who are explicitly doing open notebook science .
People such as Garrett Lisi are using mathematical wikis to develop their thinking online ; Garrett has referred to the site as “ my brain online ” .
People such as chemists Jean - Claude Bradley and Cameron Neylon are doing experiments in the open , immediately posting their results for all to see .
They ’re developing ideas like lab equipment that posts data in real time , posting data in formats that are machine - readable , enabling data mining , automated inference , and other additional services .
Stepping back , what tools like blogs , open notebooks and their descendants enable is filtered access to new sources of information , and to new conversation .
The net result is a restructuring of expert attention .
This is important because expert attention is the ultimate scarce resource in scientific research , and the more efficiently it can be allocated , the faster science can progress .
How many times have you been obstructed in your research by the need to prove or disprove a small result that is a little outside your core expertise , and so would take you days or weeks , but which you know , of a certainty , the right person could resolve in minutes , if only you knew who that person was , and could easily get their attention .
This may sound like a fantasy , but if you ’ve worked on the right open source software projects , you ’ll know that this is exactly what happens in those projects – discussion forums for open source projects often have a constant flow of messages posing what seem like tough problems ; quite commonly , someone with a great comparative advantage quickly posts a clever way to solve the problem .
If new online tools offer us the opportunity to restructure expert attention , then how exactly might it be restructured ?
One of the things we ’ve learnt from economics is that markets can be remarkably effective ways of efficiently allocating scarce resources .
I ’ll talk now about an interesting market in expert attention that has been set up by a company named InnoCentive .
To explain InnoCentive , let me start with an example involving an Indian not - for - profit called the ASSET India Foundation .
ASSET helps at - risk girls escape the Indian sex industry , by training them in technology .
To do this , they ’ve set up training centres in several large cities across India .
They ’ve received many requests to set up training centres in smaller towns , but many of those towns do n’t have the electricity needed to power technologies like the wireless routers that ASSET uses in its training centers .
On the other side of the world , in the town of Waltham , just outside Boston , is the company InnoCentive .
InnoCentive is , as I said , an online market in expert attention .
It enables companies like Eli Lilly and Proctor and Gamble to pose “ Challenges ” over the internet , scientific research problems they ’d like solved , with a prize for solution , often many thousands of dollars .
Anyone in the world can download a detailed description of the Challenge , and attempt to win the prize .
More than 160,000 people from 175 countries have signed up for the site , and prizes for more than 200 Challenges have been awarded .
What does InnoCentive have to do with ASSET India ?
Well , ASSET got in touch with the Rockefeller Foundation , and explained their desire for a low - cost solar - powered wireless router .
Rockefeller put up 20,000 in prize money to post an InnoCentive Challenge to design a suitable wireless router .
The Challenge was posted for two months at InnoCentive .
400 people downloaded the Challenge , and 27 people submitted solutions .
The prize was awarded to a 31 - year old Texan software engineer named Zacary Brown , who delivered exactly the kind of design that ASSET was looking for ; a prototype is now being built by engineering students at the University of Arizona .
Let ’s come back to the big picture .
These new forms of contribution – blogs , wikis , online markets and so forth – might sound wonderful , but you might reasonably ask whether they are a distraction from the real business of doing science ?
Should you blog , as a young postdoc trying to build up a career , rather than writing papers ?
Should you contribute to Wikipedia , as a young Assistant Professor , when you could be writing grants instead ?
Crucially , why would you share ideas in the manner of open notebook science , when other people might build on your ideas , maybe publishing papers on the subjects you ’re investigating , but without properly giving you credit ?
In the short term , these are all important questions .
But I think a lot of insight into these questions can be obtained by thinking first of the long run .
At the beginnning of the 17th century , Galileo Galilei constructed the first astronomical telescope , looked up at the sky , and turned his new instrument to Saturn .
He saw , for the first time in human history , Saturn ’s astonishing rings .
Did he share this remarkable discovery with the rest of the world ?
He did not , for at the time that kind of sharing of scientific discovery was unimaginable .
Instead , he announced his discovery by sending a letter to Kepler and several other early scientists , containing a latin anagram , “ smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras ” .
When unscrambled this may be translated , roughly , as “ I have discovered Saturn three - formed ” .
The reason Galileo announced his discovery in this way was so that he could establish priority , should anyone after him see the rings , while avoiding revealing the discovery .
Galileo could not imagine a world in which it made sense for him to freely share a discovery like the rings of Saturn , rather than hoarding it for himself .
Certainly , he could n’t share the discovery in a journal article , for the journal system was not invented until more than 20 years after Galileo died .
Even then , journals took decades to establish themselves as a legitimate means of sharing scientific discoveries , and many early scientists looked upon journals with some suspicion .
The parallel to the suspicion many scientists have of online media today is striking .
Think of all the knowledge we have , which we do not share .
Theorists hoard clever observations and questions , little insights which might one day mature into a full - fledged paper .
Entirely understandably , we hoard those insights against that day , doling them out only to trusted friends and close colleagues .
Experimentalists hoard data ; computational scientists hoard code .
Most scientists , like Galileo , ca n’t conceive of a world in which it makes sense to share all that information , in which sharing information on blogs , wikis , and their descendents is viewed as being ( potentially , at least ) an important contribution to science .
Over the short term , things will only change slowly .
We are collectively very invested in the current system .
But over the long run , a massive change is , in my opinion , inevitable .
The advantages of change are simply too great .
There ’s a story , almost certainly apocryhphal , that the physicist Michael Faraday was approached after a lecture by Queen Victoria , and asked to justify his research on electricity .
Faraday supposedly replied “ Of what use is a newborn baby ? ”
Blogs , wikis , open notebooks , InnoCentive and the like are n’t the end of online innovation .
They ’re just the beginning .
The coming years and decades will see far more powerful tools developed .
We really will enormously scale up scientific conversation ; we will scale up scientific collaboration ; we will , in fact , change the entire architecture of expert attention , developing entirely new ways of navigating data , making connections and inferences from data , and making connections between people .
When we look back at the second half of the 17th century , it ’s obvious that one of the great changes of the time was the invention of modern science .
When historians look back at the early part of the twentyfirst century , they will also see several major changes .
I know many of you in this room believe that one of those changes will be related to the sustainability of how humans live on this planet .
But I think there are at least two other major historical changes .
The first is the fact that this is the time in history when the world ’s information is being transformed from an inert , passive , widely separated state , and put into a single , unified , active system that can make connections , that brings that information alive .
The world ’s information is waking up .
The second of those changes , closely related to the first , is that we are going to change the way scientists work ; we are going to change the way scientists share information ; we are going to change the way expert attention itself is allocated , developing new methods for connecting people , for organizing people , for leveraging people ’s skills .
They will be redirected , organized , and amplified .
The result will speed up the rate at which discoveries are made , not in one small corner of science , but across all of science .
Quantum information and computation is a wonderful field .
I was touched and surprised by the invitation to speak tonight .
I have , I think , never felt more honoured in my professional life .
But , I trust you can understand when I say that I am also tremendously excited by the opportunities that lie ahead in doing science online .

Norwegian doctor : Israel intentionally targeting civilians David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday January 5 , 2009
Print This Email This Doctor estimates 2,000 - 2,500 civilian casualties
Mads Gilbert , a Norwegian doctor working in Gaza , told Sky News on Monday that that he believes Israel is deliberately attacking the Palestinian population , not just targeting Hamas as Israeli authorities have said numerous times .
" Just a little bit more than an hour ago , the Israelis bombed the central food market in Gaza City and we had a mass influx of about 50 injured and between 10 and 15 killed , " said Gilbert , on the phone with Sky News .
" At the same time they bombed an apartment house with children playing on the roof and we had a lot of children also .
This is really like from Dante 's Inferno .
It 's like hell here now and it 's been bombing all night .
Up till now , close to 500 people have been killed and the number of casualties is getting to 2 , 2 and a half thousand , which 50 percent are children and women . "
" Are your hospital 's reaching capacity ? " asked the Sky News correspondent .
" Can you deal with these people ? "
" We have been doing surgery around the clock , " Gilbert replied .
" I just talked to to one of my colleagues in the ICU who has not been sleeping for three days and they hospital is completely overcrowded and we are running six , seven OR's and there are injuries that you just do n't want to see in this world .
Children coming in with open abdomens and legs cut off .
" We just had a child who left .
We had to amputate both legs and the arms and the only crime they have done is been civilians -- Palestinians living in Gaza .
The relief now is not more doctors and more drugs the relief now is to stop the bombing immediately .
This can not go on .
It is a disaster . "
" You 've talked about the civilians , the women and children , the men who are n't involved in this but are you also getting casualties that are Hamas fighters ? " asked the reporter .
" To be honest , we came on New Year 's Eve in the morning , " answered Gilbert .
" I 've seen one military person among the tens -- I mean , hundreds -- we have seen and treated .
So , anybody who tries to claim this as sort of a clean war against another army are lying .
" This is an all out war against the civilian Palestinian population in Gaza and we can prove that with the numbers and you have to remember that the average age of the Gaza inhabitant is 17 - years .
It 's a very young population and 80 percent are living below the poverty limit of the U.N .
" So , this is a poor and very young people and they are able to escape absolutely nowhere because they can not flee like other populations can in wartime .
Because they are fenced in and they are in a cage .
So , they are bombing one and a half million people in a cage .
And young people and poor people and , you know , you can not separate between the civilians and the fighters in such a situation . "

This is probably the most expensive teddy bear ever built .
The folks at MIT ’s Personal Rbotics group have created a huggable robot with over 1500 sensors , mostly under it ’s skin .
It also has web cameras for eyes , microphones for ears and a speaker for a mouth .
The Hugggable was originally based on the idea of companian animals , but has taken the idea much further , including a web component that allows one to interact with others through the bear via the internet .

Here at Mashable , we ’re trying hard to help you stay afloat and succeed in the current economic crisis .
We ’ve told you how to build the ultimate social media resume , sites to visit if you 've been laid off , and the secrets to finding your next job using social media tools .
Now we 'll look at ten incredible social sites to help you in your job search .
Some of these sites allow you to craft a resume , while others are networking platforms that contain job listings .
By signing up for all ten , you increase your chances of getting a job and decrease the amount of time you ’ll spend searching for a new one .
Three of the listed sites can be combined with other sites to be more impactful .
In addition to joining , creating profiles and searching for jobs , I encourage you to support these sites with either a traditional website or blog , so that you have more to present to employers , in addition to your profile .
Have another social network you 'd recommend ?
Tell us more about it in the comments .
1. LinkedIn
LinkedIn is by far the # 1 spot for job seekers , those currently employed , marketers who are looking to build lists and salespeople who are seeking out new clients .
With 35 million users , including recruiters and job seekers , Linked In is quite a hot spot .
Of course , due to the current state of the economy , it 's simple to understand why Linked In is more popular than ever .
The problem is that most job seekers do n’t optimize their profile , cultivate their network , join and participate in groups , use applications and exchange endorsements .
That is basically everything you should be doing in a nutshell .
I also recommend that you use a distinct URL ( linkedin.com /in/yourfullname ) and an avatar that best represents you and is consistent with the picture on your other social sites .
When you search for a job , recognize who in your network might help you get to the hiring manager .
You ’re given 1st , 2nd and 3rd degree connections on Linked In that you should be using to secure a job opening .
2. Plaxo With Simply Hired
Plaxo is a social network that resembles LinkedIn to a certain degree .
You ’re able to create your own profile with a section about you , your contact information and your “ pulse stream , ” which is made up of your presence on social media sites such as Twitter .
You ’re even able to share your photo album and send eCards , which is a nice differentiator .
The real value in Plaxo is the address book that keeps track of all of your contact information , including a Yahoo !
Map indicating where your contacts live .
Plaxo , which is owned by Comcast , is also integrated with Simply Hired , which is a job aggregator that searches thousands of job sites and companies and aggregates them in a single location for you .
After building your Plaxo profile , use it as part of the recruitment process when applying for jobs with Simply Hired for success .
3. Twitter With Blog or LinkedIn URL
Twitter is an amazing tool if you can unlock its power .
It ’s taken me months to understand how conversations flow and how I can add to the discussion .
Twitter breaks down communication barriers and lets you talk directly to hiring managers , without having to submit a resume immediately to a machine .
Although Twitter is probably one of the best networking tools on the planet , it needs to be supplemented with a blog or Linked In profile .
There ’s no way you can hire someone based on a Twitter profile , without having a link from that profile to something else that gives more information on that job seeker .
You get to add one URL to your profile , so choose wisely .
4. Jobster
Jobster is n’t spoken about nearly enough , yet it is a powerful platform for networking with employers who are offering jobs , while you ’re searching .
You can upload your resume , embed your video resume , showcase links to your site , your picture and tag your skills , which is a unique differentiator .
You can search for open positions and see who the person is who posted the job .
Then you can add them to your network and connect with them to find out more about the position .
5. Facebook
Facebook can be used to get jobs .
There are two main ways of acquiring a job through Facebook .
The first is to go to your Facebook marketplace , which lists job openings or other opportunities in your network .
Aside from jobs , there are “ items wanted ” and a “ for sale ” listing .
When searching for jobs , you ’ll be able to see who listed the item and then message them to show your interest .
When you find a job opening that you ’re interested in , you ’ll be able to message the hiring manager directly .
For instance , the subject line of the message will auto- populate with “ Principal Web Developer in Littleton , MA ” in the subject line .
The second way to get a job using Facebook is to join groups and fan pages to find people with common interests and to network with them .
6. Craigslist
Craigslist is an extremely valuable job search tool if you ’re not looking to work for a big brand name company , such as P&G or GE .
Most of the positions on Craigslist are for consultants ( design / programming help ) and at small to midsize companies that are hiring .
There are new listings every day and if you wake up to this site every morning and refresh the page , you have a good chance at getting a job sooner rather than later .
7. MyWorkster With Indeed
MyWorkster focuses on exclusive networks for colleges , allowing students and alumni to connect for exclusive career opportunities .
This site is n’t valuable to you if you did n’t go to college though .
This social network allows you to create a professional profile and network with potential employers .
For a free account , you get a profile , instant messenger built in the site , groups , events , your resume and more .
The big differentiator is that it uses Facebook Connect to get your information .
Here is an example of a profile page .
MyWorkster also has job listings , which are provided by Indeed , a job search engine and aggregator , which is very similar to Simply Hired .
8. VisualCV
VisualCV understands the importance of personal branding in a job search .
Instead of a traditional resume , you get your own branded webpage , where you can add video , audio , images , graphs , charts , work samples , presentations and references .
VisualCVs not only let you stand out from the crowd , but communicate your value in a way that ’s not possible with static text .
After you ’ve created your VisualCV , you can display it publicly or privately , email it to a recruiter , save it as a PDF or forward the URL , which will rank high for your name .
On the site , you can search for jobs and apply directly using your VisualCV .
Everybody ’s favorite venture capitalist , Guy Kawasaki , is on their board .

9. JobFox
JobFox , like online dating , tries to pair you up with a job that best fits you .
Their differentiator is their “ Mutual Suitability SystemTM ” that enables them to match your wants and needs to those of employers to find the best relationship .
The system learns about your skills , experiences , and goals and then presents you with jobs .
Then there ’s the “ Jobfox Intro , ” where both the applicant and company get emails to encourage the connection .
Just like VisualCV , you get your own branded website , with a personal web address to send to employers .
JobFox was created by Rob McGovern , the founder of Careerbuilder.com .
10 . Ecademy
Ecademy , like LinkedIn , is a prime source for professional networking .
You have your own online profile , where you can tell people what you do .
You can join business networking groups based around your expertise and exchange messages with other members privately .
You can also ask for introductions from friends , just like Linked In .
Although , there is n’t a job search area on the site , 80 % of jobs are from networking and this place is dedicated to it .

Are you a software developer applying to a small company ?
Here ’s a tip from someone who has read thousands of resumes .
When you ’re applying to a startup , or a software company with less than , say , 100 employees , you may want to highlight the Banging Out Code parts of your experience , while deemphasizing the Middle Management parts of your experience .
When a startup CTO sees a resume that says things like :
Responsible for $ 30 m line of business
Architected new ERP platform
Managed team of 25 developers
Optimized business processes
they think , “ Spare me , that ’s all we need , somebody running around trying to manage and optimize and architect when we just need someone who is n’t afraid to write code . ”
Here ’s the stuff CTOs at startups want to see on a resume :
Single - handedly developed robust 100,000 LOC threadsafe C++ service
Contributes to OpenBSD file system in spare time
Wrote almost 75 % of the Python code running IsIt2009Yet.
Com
If you ’ve been in a large company for too long , you may feel that you put in your time , with all those years working your way up the hierarchy from the $ 50,000 coder jobs to the $ 250,000 Senior Vice President in Charge of Long Meetings With Other Senior Vice Presidents , and you ’re kind of enjoying the nice parking space and the personal assistant and stuff , and coding ?
not so much , so now you ’ve found a cool startup or small company , and you ’re thinking , maybe now ’s the time to jump ship ?
So you send your resume with your ERP stuff and SAP stuff and Vice President stuff to the startup , and it gets tossed .
Those VP jobs just do n’t exist at startups , and the few VPs they have are the founders and a key early hire or two .
Not you .
And startups certainly do n’t need extra middle managers .
To a startup founder , middle managers just seem like added expense without more code getting written , and the only thing we REALLY need is
code to be written , and
customers to be called on the telephone .
Now , there ’s a lot of resumes I see where , actually , I suspect that the candidate may have been ( ahem ) slightly overemphasizing the management / leadership / “ architect ” parts of the job , and slightly underemphasizing the banging out of code .
And that ’s fine if you ’re looking to jump to a management position at a big company that , inexplicably , does n’t have anyone to promote from within .
But for startups , everything about your resume has to scream getting your own hands dirty .
Otherwise your resume makes you look like you ’re looking for the kind of job where you can call meetings that take people away from coding all day long , which , to a startup , is about as useful as a one - legged man in a butt - kicking contest .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Actor Ricardo Montalban , star of the hit TV series " Fantasy Island , " died Wednesday in Los Angeles , a family spokesman said .
Ricardo Montalban attends the opening of a theater named for him in 2004 in Hollywood , California .
Montalban , 88 , was in deteriorating health over the past several days but " died peacefully " at 6:30 a.m. at his home , son - in - law Gilbert Smith said .
He understood " it was his time , " Smith said .
The cause of death was not given .
Montalban rose to prominence as one of the most visible Hispanic actors in post - war Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s .
But his star grew as he took on television roles as the mysterious host Mr. Roarke on the hit drama " Fantasy Island " and as Captain Kirk 's archnemesis Khan Noonien Singh in " Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan . "
Born in Mexico City , Mexico , on November 25 , 1920 , Montalban knew at an early age that he wanted to be an actor .
He moved to Hollywood as a teenager , and his first big break came when he was cast in a small part in a 1941 play , Tallulah Bankhead 's " Her Cardboard Lover . "
After starring in 13 Spanish - language films in Mexico , Montalban made his American feature film debut in 1947 in " Fiesta . "
Montalban became a member of the MGM stable and was often cast in the role of the steamy Latin lover opposite such female stars as Lana Turner and Esther Williams .
While working on " Across the Wide Missouri " with MGM 's biggest star , Clark Gable , Montalban suffered an injury to his spinal cord that , despite surgery , would plague him for decades to come , according to Turner Classic Movies .
It was during this early stage in his career that Montalban dedicated himself to changing Hollywood 's stereotypes of Latinos .
" When I first came to Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer under contract in 1945 , that 's when the image was at its worst , " Montalban said .
" They did n't realize that by trying to be colorful , they were very insulting . "
Montalban played a wide range of film roles over the years , often relishing the chance to play in comedies .
As he approached midlife in the 1960s , Montalban made numerous guest appearances on television shows including " The Untouchables " and " The Lieutenant , " eventually landing a recurring role as Damon West on the popular medical drama " Dr. Kildare . "
During this period , Montalban secured his place in science - fiction history playing the evil but charismatic Khan in the first season of " Star Trek . "
Montalban 's dignified demeanor and rich accent added flair to the small screen on a number of television shows .
It also established him as a popular pitchman for Maxwell House Coffee and Chrysler .
It was the role of the wise and benevolent Mr. Roarke on the 1970's hit TV series " Fantasy Island " that perhaps earned Montalban his greatest number of fans , something he called " very rewarding . "

But he said he tired of hearing fans shouting " Zee plane , zee plane " when they saw him .
The line was featured in the show 's opening credits by another character , Tattoo .
" They think they are the only ones that thought of saying that , " he told CNN during the 1990s .
" People mean well , but the joke gets a little tired at times . "
Montalban never tired of fighting for the rights of Latinos in Hollywood .
For almost 20 years , he served as president of Nosotros , an organization he founded for the advancement of Hispanics in the entertainment industry .
" The ideals of Nosotros continue .
As our community of Latinos in show business increases , so will our participation in all of the many aspects of our industry , " he said in 1987 .
Pirate Bay's Peter Sunde chats with Per Sundin , CEO of the Swedish subsidiary of Universal Music , in the courtroom hallway after trial adjourned for the day Wednesday .
* Photo : Oscar Swartz .
*Special correspondent Oscar Swartz reports .
STOCKHOLM – Laughter filled The Pirate Bay trial here Wednesday when John Kennedy , the chief executive of the International Federation of Phonographic Industries , testified that people would have purchased every music track they got free file sharing .
Kennedy answered an affirmative " Yes " to Pirate Bay defense attorneys when asked whether that was true .
Bursting laughter could be heard from the audio room beside the courtroom where the trial 's sound was being broadcast .
The sleek executive , flown from London , was clad in a grayish - blue tailored suit and sported a helmet of stiff , reddish blown - dried hair .
Or maybe it was a wig .
He explained that the IFPI is the industry organization of the record companies responsible for coordinating anti-piracy activities around the world and lobbying governments to pass laws making it easier to ding infringers .
When unauthorized copyright material is made available on The Pirate Bay , he said , sales of legitimate music slumps .
" If you lost 1,000 sales in week one , your recording , instead of going into the charts at
number five , would go in at number 20 .
If you aimed at number 10 – which
is good for a new artist – you could fall to number 75 and if you had
aimed at number 20 you may not make the chart at all , " he testified .
The day 's testimony – which also came from Ludvig Werner , CEO of IFPI 's Swedish section and Per Sundin , CEO of the Swedish subsidiary of Universal Music -– amounted to accounts of The Pirate Bay ruining Hollywood .
All the while , lawyers for the four Pirate Bay co-founders drove home the point that the lobbying groups do not go after the millions of people who use The Pirate Bay tracker to search for pirated works online .
Pirate Bay co-founders Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde and Carl Lundström face up to two years in prison each , in addition to fines as high as $ 180,000 .
They are accused of facilitating copyright infringement under Swedish law by running a BitTorrent tracker that has 22 million users and points the way to where chunks of files of copyright works can be accumulated and automatically assembled into full copies of copyright material .
Sundin concluded the day 's testimony and perhaps was the most aggressive witness .
He testified Pirate Bay was the root of the industry 's financial woes .
After the hearing , Sunde was seen chatting with Sundin about a lunch date .
Testimony resumes Thursday .
Threat Level is providing gavel - to - gavel coverage .

How to discover for yourself the solution of the cubic
This page is intended to be read after two others : one on what it means to solve an equation and the other on algebraic numbers , field extensions and related ideas .
Let us imagine ourselves faced with a cubic equation x3 + a x2 +bx +c = 0 .
To solve this equation means to write down a formula for its roots , where the formula should be an expression built out of the coefficients a , b and c and fixed real numbers ( that is , numbers that do not depend on a , b and c ) using only addition , subtraction , multiplication , division and the extraction of roots .
As I have done in other pages , I shall try to show that it is possible to derive such a formula by following standard mathematical instincts , without the need for mysterious flashes of inspiration .
I am certainly not claiming that any sensible person should be able to derive the formula in an hour or two - finding the right `standard mathematical instinct ' normally involves trying several that do not work .
Nevertheless , the list of suitable ones to try in any given situation is usually not too long .
If you are young and ambitious and do not yet know how to solve cubics , I would recommend having a go , or perhaps reading a short way into this page and then having a go .
Your chances of succeeding in a few hours are probably higher than you think .
Let us begin with one of the most useful ( and obvious ) general problem - solving principles in mathematics .
If you are trying to solve a problem , see if you can adapt a solution you know to a similar problem .
By using this principle , one can avoid starting from scratch with each new problem .
What matters is not the difficulty of the problem itself but the difficulty of the difference between the problem and other problems whose solutions are known .
Solving quadratics
In this case , it is absolutely obvious that the similar problem we should take is that of finding a solution to the quadratic equation x2 + 2ax + b = 0 . ( I have put in the factor 2 just for convenience - of course it makes no difference mathematically . )
How do we do that ?
Well , we `observe ' that
x2 + 2ax +b = ( x+a ) 2 + b-a2
which leads quickly to the solution
x = -a +/- ( a2 - b)1/2
Was that observation clever ?
It will be useful to dwell on this more elementary question before continuing with the cubic .
So let us imagine that we do not even know how to solve quadratics .
One line of thought that might lead us to a solution is the following .
After staring at the general equation x2 + 2ax +b = 0 and having no ideas , we fall back on the following question .
Are there special cases that I do know how to solve ?
Then , with some embarrassment , we note to ourselves that we can solve the equation when a = 0 .
That is , we can solve the equation x2 + b = 0 ( because we are allowed to take square roots ) .
Next , we perhaps note that if b=a2 then we have the equation x2 + 2ax + a 2 = 0 , which can be rewritten ( x+a ) 2 = 0 .
As soon as we have noticed this , we will realize that what helps is not that the right hand side is zero , but that the left hand side is a perfect square .
We can therefore solve ( x+a ) 2 =b for any b .
This gives us a whole family of quadratics that we can solve , so we would be mad not ask the next question .
Are there quadratic equations that cannot be written in the form ( x+a ) 2=b ?
To answer that , we need to put it back in the original form , by multiplying out the bracket and taking b over to the left hand side .
This gives us the equation x2 + 2ax + a 2 - b = 0 .
It is then clear that we can make 2a any number we want , and that , having done so , we can make a 2 - b any other number we want .
So the quadratic is solved .
If you think that it was asking too much to notice that the equation x2 + 2ax +
a 2 = 0 could be solved , then here is another route .
It does n't take much curiosity to wonder whether 1+21 / 2 is an algebraic number , or much talent to notice that if x=1+21 / 2 then ( x - 1 ) 2 = 2 .
Generalizing this example leads quickly to the observation that equations of the form ( x+a ) 2 =b can be solved .
A preliminary simplification of the cubic .
What would be the natural generalization to cubics of the process of completing the square ?
To answer a question of this kind , the following tactic is often useful .
Give a general description of what it is that one would like to generalize .
I shall try to illustrate what I mean just by doing it .
To complete the square one notes that ( x+a /2 ) 2 = x2 + ax +a2/4 , so that we can write any quadratic that begins x2 + ax as ( x+ a / 2 ) 2 plus a constant .
To put that another way , if we let y=x + a / 2 , then y satisfies a quadratic equation of the particularly simple form y2+C=0 .
Of course , once we have solved the equation for y , it is easy to obtain a solution for x , since x is a very simple linear function of y .
What was simpler about the equation for y ?
There are two reasonable answers to this question , and it is worth looking at both of them .
The first is to note that the equation for y involves only y2 and a constant term - so replacing x by y allows us to assume that the coefficient of the linear term is zero .
The second is more obvious - it is simpler because by allowing ourselves to take square roots we have declared that equations of the form y2 +C=0 can be solved at a stroke .
This line of thought leads to two questions .
1 . Is there a similar way to simplify a cubic so that some of the coefficients become zero ?
2 . Is there a similar way to simplify a cubic so that it becomes of the form y3+C=0 ?
The answer to question 1 is not hard to find .
If y=x+t then y3=x3+3tx2 +3t2x+t3 .
Therefore , if t=a / 3 then the cubic x3 + a x2 +bx +c can be rewritten as y3 + py +q , where ( for what it is worth ) p=b-3t2 and q=c-bt +2t3 .
Writing this in terms of a we have p=b -a2/3 and q=c-ab/3+2a3/27 .
As for the second question , we can start to think about it by asking ourselves the following direct generalization of a question we asked about quadratics .
Are there cubic equations that cannot be written in the form ( x+a ) 3=b , and if so , which ones can ?
Expanding and subtracting , we find that we can easily solve equations of the form
x3 + 3ax2 + 3a2 x + a 3 - b = 0
When is the equation
x3 + ax2 + bx +c = 0
of this type ?
Comparing it with the preceding one we see that it is of the required form if the pair ( a , b ) is of the form ( 3s,3s2 ) for some s , which it is if and only if a 2=3 b .
So the following question arises naturally .
Can we replace x by some y=x+t in such a way that y satisfies a cubic with a '2=3 b ' ( where a ' and b ' are the coefficients of y2 and y respectively ) .
This approach looks promising , because t gives us one degree of freedom and all we want is one condition - that a '2 - 3 b ' should be zero .
It is obvious how to answer the question , so let us go ahead and do it .
Writing x=y-t and substituting we obtain the equation
( y - t ) 3 + a (y - t ) 2 + b( y - t ) +c = 0
which rearranges itself to
y3 + ( a - 3t ) y2 + ( b - 2at+3t2y ) + c-bt+at2+t3
This gives us a'=a - 3t and b'=b -2at+3t2 .
Therefore ,
a'2-3b'=a2-6at+9t2 -3b+6at-9t2=a2-3b .
What we have shown is that we cannot change the quantity a 2 - 3 b by making a substitution of the form y=x+t .
In other words , the answer to question 2 above is no , at least when `a similar way ' is taken to mean that we should use such a substitution .
A slightly fancier way to say that a2 - 3 b does n't change is to call it an invariant .
Is it an unfortunate accident that a 2 - 3b is an invariant ?
Further reflection gives us a reason for this phenomenon , and shows that we were foolish ever to expect that the cubic could be solved so simply .
You may already have noticed that a 2 - 3 b= - 3 p , where p was the coefficient of the linear term we obtained when we converted the cubic x3 + a x2 + bx +c into the simpler cubic y3 + py + q .
We chose y to be x+a/3 and it is easy to see that no other choice would have led to the coefficient of y2 being zero .
Hence , the invariant we have discovered has an interpretation ( as one should always expect ) : it is the coefficient of the linear term when the quadratic term has been removed by a substitution of the form y=x+t .
But it is now obvious that this quantity is an invariant .
After all , if I substitute y=x+s ( for any s ) and then ask what further substitution z=y+r will remove the quadratic term , the answer is that z=x+r+s and r+s has to be a /3 .
Therefore , the p that I obtain for y is the same as the p that I obtain for x .
An impasse and how to break it .
Actually , it was obvious in advance that the second approach to solving the cubic was doomed to fail , since if it were possible to `complete the cube ' then every cubic would be of the form ( x+a ) 3+b .
But if that were true , then why would we have been bothering to convert a cubic into that form ?
So , not only is completing the cube impossible , it is impossible for simple and compelling reasons .
On the other hand , is n't completing the cube the natural generalization of completing the square ?
Now that we have tried it and failed , it is as though we have blown our main chance to solve the cubic ( which was to see how we solved the quadratic and adapt our method ) .
However , this sort of defeatist attitude is often a mistake .
Perhaps one can even express this view with another general principle .
There may be many ways to adapt or generalize a proof .
But how , one might ask , should one search for different generalizations ?
Let me modify an earlier suggestion .
Give a description of the argument that one would like to generalize .
Explain why it worked .
Make the explanation vaguer and more general , and then try to find different arguments that work for the same ( vaguer ) reasons .
So that we can put that into practice , let me once again describe how to solve the quadratic .
Let y=x + a/ 2 .
Then y satisfies a quadratic equation of the particularly simple form y2+C=0 .
Once we have solved this equation for y , it is easy to obtain a solution of the original equation for x , since x is a very simple linear function of y .
Why , in general terms , did that work ?
We needed two properties of y .
First , y should satisfy an equation that we knew how to solve , and secondly x should depend on y in a simple way - so that once we knew y we could work out x .
If we wish to carry this approach over to the cubic , then we should have clear answers to the following two questions .
( i) Which equations can we solve ?
( ii ) How are we prepared to allow y to depend on x ?
The answer to the first question we more or less know already .
We can solve linear and quadratic equations , and also cubic equations if they happen to have the nice form x3+C=0 .
As for the second , so far we have considered substitutions of the form y=x+t .
What other substitutions could there possibly be ?
I shall answer this question by yet another time - honoured method , which occurs all over mathematics .
Do the most general thing you can possibly imagine .
Then , when you find that you need certain properties , make what you have done more specific by introducing those properties .
Suppose then that we make the substitution y=f ( x ) .
( It is hard to see how we could be more general than that . )
Let us suppose that this leads to an equation for y that we can solve .
When will knowing y be of any use ?
The answer is obvious - when we can solve the equation y=f( x ) for x in terms of y .
But we know which equations we can solve - linear , quadratic and simple cubic equations .
We have already tried linear substitutions and seen their limitations , so we are left with two reasonable possibilities for f( x ) .
One is x2+ax + b ( it is not hard to see that giving x2 a different coefficient is not going to make a significant difference ) and the other is x3+c .
Following some very general problem - solving techniques has led us to an idea that is definitely new .
By standing back a little , we realized that the important thing about the substitution y=x+t in the solution of the quadratic was not that it magically worked , or that it was linear , but that it was invertible in the sense that we could give a formula for x in terms of y .
The impasse is now broken in the sense that we have an approach to try with the cubic .
It may not work , but having an approach that may or may not work is much better than having no approach at all .
A substitution that solves the cubic .
If a linear substitution worked for quadratic equations , then which sounds more likely to work for cubic equations - a quadratic substitution or a particular kind of cubic substitution ?
Somehow the quadratic one is more promising , as it fits the general description of having degree one less than that of the equation one is trying to solve .
This is not a particularly convincing argument , but the worst that can happen is that we try it and it does n't work .
So let us see where we can get with the substitution y=x2+ux+v .
We now run into a problem .
We are hoping that y will satisfy a cubic of a particularly simple form .
But is it obvious that it satisfies any cubic ?
If you do not find it obvious then this is the point where it will help to have read my page on algebraic numbers , because there I repeatedly used a trick which works here as well ( and which , I stress , arose naturally in that context ) .
We know that x satisfies the equation
x3 + ax2 + bx +c = 0
But this means that every time we write down a polynomial in x , we can replace x3 by - ax2 - bx - c , x4 by - ax3 - bx2 - cx and so on .
That is , every polynomial expression in x is equal to some quadratic function of x .
But y2 and y3 are polynomial functions of x , and hence equal to quadratic ones .
This is trivially true of 1 and y as well .
Hence , the numbers 1 , y , y2 and y3 are all of the form rx2+sx+t .
For y to satisfy a cubic we need a non-trivial linear combination of 1 , y , y2 and y3 to be zero .
To obtain this , we need to solve three homogeneous linear equations in four unknowns , which we can always do .
So now we can describe a possible method more precisely : let y=x 2+ux+v , work out y2 and y3 in terms of x , reduce them to quadratics using the fact that x3 = - ax2 - bx - c , find a non-trivial linear relationship between 1 , y , y2 and y3 , write out the corresponding cubic y3+dy2+ey +f in y and finally ( the most important part ) cleverly choose u and v in such a way that d2=3e .
We have no guarantee that this will work , because it may be that , as happened with linear substitutions , there simply is no choice of u and v that makes d2 equal to 3e , or it may be that , although such a choice exists , the dependence of u and v on a , b and c is so complicated that we do n't know how to solve the resulting equations .
It is reasonable not to worry too much about the first potential difficulty , because we now have an extra degree of freedom , and there does n't seem to be an argument telling us that it cannot possibly help .
However , if you now go away and try to work out the details of the argument outlined above , you will see that complication is something one should definitely worry about .
Indeed , it may seem after a while that in order to work out u and v you will have to solve quintics .
Let me take it as read that just plunging in is a bad idea .
In any case , it is another good problem - solving strategy to try simpler ( but less general ) approaches first , just in case they work .
So how might we make the above calculations manageable ?
One obvious idea is to use the simplification we obtained earlier : we might as well assume that a=0 .
This will allow us to replace x3 by - px - q .
In fact , it is a little nicer to say that x3 =px+q , which we can do by changing the definitions of p and q .
And what about the substitution y=x2+ux+v ?
Well , remembering the invariant we discovered earlier , we should realize that y satisfies a cubic that we can easily solve if and only if y-v does .
So we might as well save on algebra by setting v=0 .
In other words , not only will we simplify calculations by setting y=x2+ux , we will not even lose any generality .
Here are some calculations that arise when one starts with the equation x3 =px+q , sets y=x2+ux , and tries to find a cubic satisfied by y .
Doing it directly ( that is , by working out y2 and y3 and solving some simultaneous equations ) still gets unpleasant , but the calculations can be kept manageable by simplifying as we go along , as is done below .
I shall also save time by writing C to mean a constant ( depending on p , q and u ) which may vary from line to line .
x3=px+q
y=x2+ux
y2=x4+2ux3 +u2x2
=( u2+p) x2+( 2up+q)x+2uq
=( u2+p ) y+( up+q-u3) x+2uq
y3=( u2+p ) y2 +( up+q-u3 ) xy+ 2uqy
=( u2+p ) y2 +( up+q-u3 )( x3+ux2 ) + 2uqy
=( u2+p ) y2 +( up+q-u3 ) ( ux2+px ) +2uqy +C
=( u2+p ) y2 +( up+q-u3 ) ( uy +( p-u2 ) x ) + 2uqy +
C
From an earlier line we have that
( up+q - u3 ) x =y2-( u2+p ) y +
C
so this is equal to
( u2+p ) y2 +( up+q-u3)uy +( p-u2 ) ( y2-( u2+p ) y ) + 2uqy +
C
=2py2+( u2p+3uq - p2 ) y+C
Thus , y satisfies the cubic equation
y3 - 2py2 -( u2p+3uq-p2)y- C=0
and all that is left to decide is whether u can be chosen in such a way that
( - 2p)2=-3(u2p+3uq - p2 )
that is , such that
3pu2+9qu+p2=0
This , being a quadratic in u , can be solved .
Using this value of u one obtains a cubic in y that can be `completed ' .
This gives a solution of y .
Then x can be worked out from y by solving a further quadratic .
Of course , the resulting formula , if one worked it out , would be pretty unpleasant , and I should now say that better methods have been discovered ( involving different substitutions ) that lead to easier calculations and neater answers .
They are easy to find on the internet , but all tend to have a ` magic ' quality about them .
I should also say that I have n't discussed the annoying problem that not all the `solutions ' that arise by the above method will necessarily be solutions , since knowledge of y does n't uniquely determine x .
Just to see how there might be other sensible substitutions , let us return to the question of which ones allow us to calculate x .
We noted that we could do so if y was a quadratic function of x .
But this was not absolutely necessary , even if we could only solve quadratic equations .
For example , if y were defined implicitly by x2+ uxy +v=0 , then knowing y would still allow us to determine x .
As a matter of fact , the simplest method works for a completely different reason .
It involves substituting the other way - by setting x=w+p/3w ( when the equation is x3=px+q ) and finding that the resulting equation in w is a quadratic in w3 .
This method is described in more detail here .
I do not have a plausible explanation for how it was discovered .
I am glad higher profile bloggers are beginning to recognize what I have been saying for days .
John McCain is a coward :
He ever swaggered on for a couple days about how he was going to ‘ take the gloves off ’ when he met up with Obama in Nashville .
But when the two of them were there in each others physical presence … nothing .
By a myriad of gestures and reactions Obama owned him .
Nor is it a matter of shifting off the tactics , because as soon as McCain made his hasty retreat from the stage at Debate # 2 he was right back at it .
In every other aspect of life , high and low , refined and unlovely , we have a word for that kind of behavior : cowardice .
And now Obama can lightly taunt McCain with that very cowardice , his inability to just say it to his face .
And if my take on the inner workings of McCain ’s mind at the moment is right that should simply unhinge him even more .
John McCain is not man enough to own his shit .
John McCain will not openly confront Obama with his smears and lies and innuendo .
John McCain will not come out and talk about Ayers , he has to be asked .
That is why he goes to places like Fox News , so he can be asked .
What a coincidence .
John McCain is a coward .
John McCain would rather hide behind his wife and Sarah Palin than say it himself .
He would rather produce 2 minute ads that his campaign will never pay to air anywhere , and hope that the tire - swinging media will bring up the topic so he does n’t have to do it himself .
John McCain just wants to throw shit out there , and “ raise questions ” about Obama , and hope his supporters connect the dots , because he is too much of a coward to directly push this toxic stew .
He would rather hide behind right - wing bloggers , surrogates , and scummy websites staffed with wingnut welfare recipients like the NRO and the Weekly Standard .
John McCain had 90 minutes to bring this stuff up to Obama , to his face , and passed .
John McCain is a coward .
*** Update ***
Joe Biden is right :
“ All of the things they said about Barack Obama in the TV , on the TV , at their rallies , and now on Youtube and everything else , ” Biden said — referring to McCain and Palin tying Obama to Weatherman bomber Bill Ayers and accusing him of “ palling around with terrorists . ”
“ John McCain could not bring himself to look Barack Obama in the eye and say the same things to him , ” he said to cheers .
“ In my neighborhood , you got something to say to a guy , you look him in the eye and you say it to him . “
Coward .
*** Update # 2 ***
And the nonsense starts .
No one is debating that John McCain at one time exhibited great bravery in Vienam that I do n’t think I would have possessed .
How that changes what he has done the past few weeks , inciting his supporters to call Obama a terrorist while refusing to engage Obama directly on the matter , hiding behind surrogates and their sleazy innuendo , not mentioning the subject even though the gloves are “ off ” yet hoping upon hope that someone will ask him about it , is beyond me .
It was one thing with Kerry - what McCain is doing now is dangerous , and he wo n’t even own it .
Take that 2 minute commercial you released on the web , and pay for a national airing .
If you want it out there , have it out there with your name on it and with your money backing it .
Say something at the next debate .
Own it .
McCain is acting like a coward , and what he and his campaign are doing is a disgrace .
Period .
And you can take extra special pleasure in the fact that Mr. Pent Up Jammies is chucking out the phrase keyboard commando .
More McCain handiwork .
" Computation " considered harmful .

" Value " not so hot either .
Posted on
The term " computation " has at least six different senses , all of which are commonly used in technical literature :
a dynamic computing process
the result of a computational process
an algorithm that describes a computational process
a formal description of an algorithm in a specific language
a formal description of the semantics of a computational process ; e.g. a lambda expression
a dynamic process that converts a lambda expression to normal form
a formal description of lambda conversion
One could probably come up with additional technical uses for the term .
Even worse , " computation " is an ordinary word with well - understood if inexact semantics .
Readers come to a technical text with a well - formed idea of what the word means , and thus no reason to think their notion is incorrect .
" Value " is even worse .
It too carries multiple technical meanings in the literature , and it is even more common in ordinary language .
Same for " evaluation " .
These terms are ambiguous .
They should be banned from technical discourse .
Usually this ambiguity is tolerable , at least for subject matter experts .
But when it becomes a problem , it 's a big problem .
It cost me many exasperating hours of head - scratching when I decided to finally get to the bottom of monads and IO in Haskell .
The texts that flummoxed me are Moggi 's paper on " notions of computation " and the standard idiom used to describe IO in Haskell .
Moggi ( Notions of computation and monads , p. 3 ) :
In particular , we identify the type A with the object of values ( of type A ) and obtain the object of computations ( of type A ) by applying an unary type - constructor T to A .
We call T a notion of computation , since it abstracts away from the type of values computations may produce .
A typical example of how IO is described in Haskell ( A History of Haskell : Being Lazy With Class , p. 25 ) :
The key idea is to treat a value of type IO a as a “ computation ” that , when performed , might perform input and output before delivering a value of type a .
Obviously this language is " good enough " , since Moggi 's paper was very influential , and Haskell is very successful .
But both passages immediately struck me as hazy and somewhat absurd .
Try as I might , I could find no way to assign a precise meaning to them .
It took a lot of research and a flurry of messages on the haskell - cafe mailing list to figure out why they did n't work for me and discover what the authors ( probably ) meant .
Needless to say , part of the problem was the ambiguity of the terms " computation " and " value " .
I came to the texts thinking that a value is either a " datum " like 3 or a function like sqrt .
They 're just static mathematical objects , so I could not conceive of how a value could " be " a computation , or could " be performed " .
The scales fell from my eyes when I came across the following passage buried in the Wikipedia article on Theory of Computation :
A computation consists of an initial lambda expression ( or two if you want to separate the function and its input ) plus a finite sequence of lambda terms , each deduced from the preceding term by one application of Beta reduction .
I was already familiar with the lambda calculus , but I had never thought of a lambda expression as a " computation " .
I still do n't like it ; a lambda expression is not a computation , it 's a formal representation of a mathematical object ( a value ) .
Lambda conversion is a purely syntactic calculation that yields a different notational representation of the same value .
The lambda calculus is a formal model of computation ; the same computation could be represented in a different formalism .
So it 's just wrong to say that a computation is a sequence of lambda expressions .
Nonetheless , it 's clear why one might think in these terms and use this language , and I think that is what 's going on in the passages quoted above .
My ideas of computation and value were based on the idea of a direct mapping from expression to mathematical object .
Even though I was quite familiar the notions of language and metalanguage , I thought of a metalanguage as serving mainly to clarify meaning ; once you understand the semantics of the language , you can disregard the metalanguage and think directly in terms of abstract semantic objects ( e.g. numbers and functions . )
But in Haskell that 's not good enough ; to understand how lazy evaluation works , you need to keep lambda calculus ( or the equivalent ) in mind , because denotation has to pass through lambda expressions in various states of reduction before arriving at normal form and then semantic objects .
You cannot disregard the lambda metalanguage , because the different forms lambda expressions may take constitute part of the semantic universe .
Make it explicit and things become more clear .
The above definition of Haskell IO becomes :
The key idea is to treat a value of type IO a as a “ lambda expression ” that , when converted to normal form , might perform input and output before delivering a value of type a .
Unfortunately , that 's not good enough : how can a lambda expression in normal form " be performed " and " deliver " a value ?
That is the subject of my next post , wherein I will discuss weaknesses in Haskell 's informal metalanguage and suggest replacements for " computation " , " value " , and " evaluation " .

BHP Billiton this morning revealed plans to sack 6000 employees and contractors around the globe - including 3400 in Australia - and close its disastrous Ravensthorpe nickel laterite project in Western Australia .
Ravensthorpe , which was officially opened by BHP 's chairman , Don Argus , only last May , will be closed by June at the cost of 1800 jobs .
Of those , 1450 are in WA and 350 are at the associated Yabulu nickel refinery in Queensland .
BHP Billiton shares tumbled in early trade , before closing 29 cents lower , or 1 % , at $ 28.66 .
The plans are likely to devastate regional communities like Hopetoun in WA , which had received an influx of new residents over the last few years due to the huge Ravensthorpe project .

Targeting civilians was a deliberate part of this bid to humiliate Hamas and the Palestinians , and pulverise Gaza into chaos .(...)
First , to what this war on Gaza is not about : it 's not about the rockets .
During the truce last year , rocket fire from the Gaza Strip was reduced by 97 % , with the few projectiles that were fired coming from non-Hamas groups opposed to the agreement .
Despite this success in vastly improving the security of Israelis in the south , Israel did everything it could to undermine the calm , and provoke Hamas into a conflict .(...)
Estimates for the proportion of civilian deaths among the 1,360 Palestinians killed range from more than half to two - thirds .

Are photographs of a mother breast - feeding her child indecent ?
The social networking site Facebook has sparked a massive online debate -- and protests -- and after removing photos that expose too much of a mother ’s breast .

The social networking site Facebook has sparked a massive online debate -- and protests -- and after removing photos that expose too much of a mother 's breast .
REUTERS / Regis Duvignau
Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt said the website takes no action over most breast - feeding photos because they follow the site ’s terms of use but others are removed to ensure the site remains safe and secure for all users , including children .
“ Photos containing a fully exposed breast ( as defined by showing the nipple or areola ) do violate those terms ( on obscene , pornographic or sexually explicit material ) and may be removed , ” he said in a statement .
“ The photos we act upon are almost exclusively brought to our attention by other users who complain . ”
But Facebook ’s decision to ban some breast - feeding photos has angered some users , including U.S. mother Kelli Roman whose photograph of her feeding her daughter was removed by Facebook .
Roman is one of the administrators of an online petition called “ Hey Facebook , breastfeeding is not obscene ! ” which has picked up speed in the past week after protesters organized a virtual “ nurse - in ” on Facebook and held a small demonstration outside Facebook ’s office in Palo Alto , California .
The petition has now attracted more than 80,000 names and over 10,000 comments , reigniting the old debate about the rights or wrongs of breast - feeding in public .
Organizers of the petition said some women had been warned not to repost photographs that had been removed from their pages or they would face being kicked off Facebook .
One breast - feeding mother , called Rebekah , said Facebook removed a photograph of her feeding her child .
“ I find it offensive that ( Facebook ) can remove my photo but not the close up picture of a thonged backside I ( have ) seen on a friend ’s page or remove the “ what kama sutra position are you ? ” quiz application , ” she wrote .
Facebook , which has more than 120 million members , is standing by its decision .
Schnitt said the company had called many U.S. media groups during the course of the protest to ask to place an advert related to breast - feeding that showed a woman breast - feeding her child with a fully exposed breast .
None agreed .
“ Obviously , a newspaper and Facebook are different things but the underlying motivation for the content policies are the same , ” he told Reuters .

What We Need From Our Homes in the Age of COVID - 19
Q
Remember the " silly season " in politics ?
Well in case you were wondering , we 're now in the silly season of energy .
Oil traded from $ 35 to $ 50 and back to $ 37 in under three weeks , with no discernible reason based in fundamentals .
Sure , we had lots of interesting news — inventory builds , paid - off pirates , geopolitical posturing , and a slew of revised demand and price forecasts — but nothing that would , in my mind at least , justify such short , sharp moves .
I can only conclude that the volatility in oil is an indication that traders are desperately seeking the right price .
I have news for them :
As my friend energy analyst Gregor MacDonald ( on Twitter : @ GregorMacDonald ) said today , " Oil at 38.00 is free . "
Never mind the latest price forecast from the Department of Energy , which speculated that the recession in the US , Europe and Japan would give us an oil price of $ 43.25 a barrel this year .
As bad as their track record in price forecasting is , you 'd think they would at least have the decency to round it to the nearest buck !
( For more on that , see " EIA 's Oil Outlook Report . " )
As for forecasting $ 54.50 a barrel in 2010 ... well , that 's just silly .
I understand that they have a mandate to forecast , but there should be a big , fat , red asterisk after any such prognostication , with a footnote saying " +/- 100 % . "
I would n't put much credence in the latest statement from the oil minister of Oman , either , who projected that oil would stay below $ 50 this year under recessionary pressure .
In fact , never mind any of the price forecasts you hear right now .
There is no signal ; it 's all noise .
Lots and lots of noise .
Better yet , turn off CNBC altogether , for it can drive you mad .
Even the demand forecasts , upon which price forecasts are based , are suspect .
I can't think of a single forecast from last June saying that global demand would crash 2.5 million barrels per day by September .
It just was n't knowable .
I certainly did n't expect it .
So , I do n't have much confidence in the EIA 's revised demand forecast , either , which projects that world oil consumption will fall by 800,000 barrels per day this year .
I do n't mean to pick on the EIA particularly ; they just happen to be the official agency responsible for energy data , and they must offer some numbers .
They are also wise to tell the real story : " The oil price path going forward will be driven mainly by the depth and duration of the global economic downturn , the pace and timing of the recovery , and actual OPEC production . "
On the question of the economic downturn and recovery , I do n't think anybody can say with confidence what those timelines are .
Most of the analysts I respect do n't see an economic recovery until perhaps mid-2010 , and then it will likely take until 2012 to get back to ‘ normal ' business .
We do , however , have some clear news from Saudi Arabia , where oil minister Ali al - Naimi has indicated that its output would be " lower than the target " announced in December — in other words , further production cuts .
In which case , oil at $ 38 might as well be free .
OPEC has made it clear that it will continue to try to put a floor under oil , and that floor should be around $ 70 .
Since OPEC moves typically lag the market , and oil is already badly underpriced , every production cut now only stretches the price slingshot a little tighter .
When demand recovers , prices will snap back in a New York minute .
Perhaps that tension is the real explanation for the volatility of the last three weeks .
Putting aside all that noise , however , here 's the signal : peak oil .
We need to start taking the long view on energy .
~~ad_0 ~~
The Long View on Energy
What is the long - term outlook for energy ?
From my study of the data , it 's pretty simple .
We 're essentially at peak oil now because the global recession has wiped out any hope of achieving some theoretical higher peak two years from now .
July 2008 will probably prove to be the absolute peak , but the " peak " will really be a plateau stretching from roughly 2005 - 2012 .
Then we will begin the long descent down the back of Hubbert 's Curve .
By 2050 , the world will have to make do with roughly half the current energy budget , all forms of energy included .
By 2100 , most fossil fuels will be kaput .
By 2150 , I expect the world will be basically living off of solar income again , meaning biomass plus whatever remains of the renewable energy infrastructure .
( At some point , I conjecture in the 2050 - 2100 time frame , it will get progressively more difficult to build and maintain renewable energy infrastructure because liquid fuels will be very limited and expensive . )
So , that 's the outlook .
The data supporting it is all publicly available , as I have documented in painstaking detail in my book Profit from the Peak .
Barring some unforeseen event , like aliens dropping some crazy new energy technology on us , or cracking the cold fusion conundrum , there is little data to suggest otherwise .
Even oil and gas companies see the coming transformation .
A recent survey by Deloitte of 52 directors and higher - level executives at oil and gas companies worth $ 100 million or more found that a majority believe reasonably priced oil will be out of reach for the US within 25 years , and for the world within 50 years .
Three - quarters of them believe oil and gas is currently cheap , but only one - quarter think it will be cheap within 25 years .
Only 17 % think oil and gas will be sustainable within 25 years , and a majority see renewable energy taking their place .
Three - quarters also believe that " transitioning away from the nation 's reliance on fossil fuels for transportation is an appropriate goal for the country . "
As we stand now on the cusp of " Change , " then , what kind of infrastructure will Obama 's stimulus plan give us , and will it conform to that outlook ?
Rail to the Future , or Roads to Nowhere ?
I have hoped as much as the next guy that the next administration will set a new and better course , but I am beginning to have my doubts .
It is abundantly clear to me , as it is to any student of peak oil or anybody who has read my column or my books , that rail is the obvious priority for the future of transportation .
Rail is by far the cheapest and most fuel - efficient form of transport , requiring about a third less fuel than air for personal travel , and as little as 3 % of the energy for freight .
Yet , our current rail system is a joke compared to the rest of the developed world .
As James Howard Kunstler has remarked , even Bulgaria would be ashamed of our rail system .
Destinations are limited , especially in the West , and most of the trains run on diesel .
Our fastest train , Amtrak 's Acela , only does about 100 mph on its short run from Boston to D.C. , less than half the speed of modern high - speed trains elsewhere .
If we really intend to have an infrastructure that survives peak oil , we have to transform it to run on renewably generated electricity .
We also have to expand it massively and take millions of cars and transport trucks off the road .
Doing so would probably cost trillions of dollars and would be worth every penny .
For example , a high - speed rail corridor for the Northeast would run about $ 32 billion .
Laying high - speed rail between the major cities of California would cost north of $ 40 billion .
So far , however , I have seen little suggestion of such an ambitious transformation .
The funding package approved in October by Congress would grant a paltry $ 13 billion to passenger rail over five years , of which three - fourths would go to Amtrak .
Another $ 5 billion is currently proposed by the House transportation and infrastructure committee for intercity rail .
That 's not transformation spending ; that 's barely better than maintenance spending .
In fact , despite Obama 's pledge to devote funds to projects beyond " roads and bridges , " it 's now looking like the states might hijack those funds and try to pour much of the Obama stimulus package money into roads and cars .
According to a report by Bloomberg , Missouri plans to spend $ 750 million of it on highways and nothing on mass transit .
Utah would devote 87 % of its share to new roads , and Arizona would spend $ 869 million on highways .
Presumably , other states have similar priorities .
I 'm not unsympathetic to the plight of the states .
Saddled with declining revenues due to the recession and a crumbling road , bridge and airport infrastructure badly in need of repair , they have to do something .
In the absence of strong federal leadership into mass transit , they have little choice but to try to maintain what they have .
A spokesman for House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman James Oberstar quoted in the Bloomberg article was blunt : " We like the environmentally friendly way of doing things but the charge we were given was to come up with something that can happen quickly , " he said .
" We can't lose sight of what the primary goal here is , and that is to put people to work . "
Not Just Jobs , but the Right Jobs
Which brings us to the key point : Instead of seeking " shovel ready " projects that can be started within 180 days to create new jobs ASAP , the Obama team should be looking at the long view on energy and ensuring what we build now is truly built to last .
Roads — especially new roads — are definitely not that .
According to the director of Washington - based Building America 's Future , some $ 16.5 billion in mass transit projects can be started within a year .
( By comparison , tens of billions of dollars have already been committed to high - speed electric rail in Europe and Asia . )
Those projects should be our immediate national priority , followed by some deep and serious planning for a long - term transportation infrastructure that will survive $ 150 oil and declining supply .
President Roosevelt created just such a planning board as part of the New Deal , which eventually resulted in the interstate highway system .
By planning for it now , we could achieve a somewhat orderly transition away from liquid fuels and toward efficient electric transport .
We 'll still create millions of new jobs , only they 'll be the right jobs .
Jobs that wo n't disappear the next time oil spikes .
Sooner or later , we will have to make some hard choices about what kind of future we want : one that is doomed , but to our current liking , or one that our children 's children can rely on .
Do we really want to leave them a decrepit landscape of useless asphalt and concrete and an economy that 's run out of fuel ?
What we need now is an honest , long - range strategy .
We need to build rail , rip up roads , massively beef up the electrical grid , and deploy millions of renewable energy generators — the more distributed , the better .
I sincerely hope that the incoming administration will avoid the temptation to reach for the quick fix of new jobs and deliver us that strategy .
Without it , we may indeed be lost .
Allow me to close with a stanza from James Taylor 's " Traffic Jam " :
Now I used to think that I was cool
Running around on fossil fuel
Until I saw what I was doin '
Was driving down the road to ruin .
Until next time ,
Chris

MADISON , Wis. , Nov. 28 ( UPI ) --
Five astronomy students at the University of Wisconsin - Madison have carried their research to unexpected heights -- they found a galaxy .
They made their improbable find in a most improbable way , using the world 's largest radio telescope , the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico .

The students told the Wisconsin Sate Journal that their good fortune was not expected when they signed up for a research methods class being taught by UW - Madison astronomer Snezana Stanimirovic .
But the astronomer had worked three years with the Arecibo Observatory and because of her connections , she was able to get observation time for her students , the report said .
Time on Arecibo is prized even by long - time professional astronomers , Stanimirovic said .
The telescope 's dish is the largest in the world and covers 20 acres carved out of the Puerto Rican jungle .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold bugs enjoy a special place here on Wall Street .
They 're our bizarre -o twins in the world of investing .
When our market is up , theirs is down .
We trade securities used to assign a value to companies , industries and commodities .
They trade a useless piece of rock that people dig up .
We do n't understand one another , so we eye each other warily .
Sure , some of us may own a little gold , but we only hold it as a hedge -- or as jewelry .
The gold bugs may hold some stock , but their hearts are n't in it .
And they can't wear it .
They 'd rather be standing at the corner of Wall and Broad streets with their sandwich boards shouting , " The end is nigh . "
They appreciate stockpiling .
We appreciate things like electricity and running water .
Yet when things get tough , the gold bugs always seem to have the last laugh .
Yes , gold GLD , +0.84 % has dipped a little from the rarefied air around $ 1,000 an ounce .
But it 's still trading near where it was a year ago .
Holding steady puts your asset class in elite company these days .
And have you ever noticed that , even though there have been some good con artists , there 's never been a brazen Ponzi scheme in the world of gold investing ?
Sure , miners have often promised and not delivered .
But when it comes to old - fashioned fraud , gold is hard to trick .
Either you have it or you do n't .
That 's why the government 's arrest of David Copeland Reed caught a lot of the gold world 's attention Tuesday .
Reed was the gold world 's Bernie Madoff .
No , he did n't make off with $ 50 billion , and he surely did n't turn himself in , but Reed in just a few months allegedly bilked investors out of $ 12.8 million using nothing more than a computer , some fast talking and , oh yes , the glitter of gold .
Reed , charged with three counts of wire fraud and some money - laundering violations , basically set up an Internet bank called OSGold in the spring of 2001 .
His hook was n't that he had Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
backing ; it was gold bullion .
Not just any gold bullion , but a lot of it -- stored in an offshore vault .
His deposit - taking method was n't some kind of fancy encrypted , password - protected computer affair .
No , he asked customers to wire him their money .
The money began to really flow in May 2001 , when he offered investors what prosecutors say was a fund promising a 30 % compounded , three - month return and a 45 % annual return .
The nice thing about this investment was that Reed promised the principal was fully guaranteed .
Customers knew this to be true because they could look up their accounts on Reed 's Web site .
Those blazing computer screens consistently gave his investors the good news , prosecutors say .
Huge gains were made in the " foreign exchange markets . "
Twelve months and close to 66,000 accounts later , Reed disappeared .
Holy Harry Markopoulos , that was easy .
Everyone knows that if something is on the Internet it must be true .
But in this case , it was n't .
One of the bank 's customers tried to make a withdrawal of $ 10 million in 2002 and came up empty .
Insufficient funds .
Prosecutors say Reed made off with his clients ' cash , which he used to buy tickets to Cancun , Mexico .
There he bought cars and launched business ventures such as a nightclub , a gym and a shopping mall .
Foreign exchange , indeed .
When the jig was up in the summer of 2002 , Reed and his family stuffed a bunch of cash in duffel bags and their clothes and boarded a plane for Cancun .
Prosecutors say that to buy some time he told investors that there were " technical problems " at the bank -- which was technically true :
The money was being crammed into luggage .
Reed came back to the states and was arrested in Columbia , S.C. , earlier this month .
He faces up to 20 years in prison and fines if convicted .
Reed 's is hardly the worst of the frauds that have come to light in recent months .
We 're all aware of the Robert Allen Stanford 's arrest last week for an alleged $ 8 billion fraud , and , of course , of Bernie Madoff 's high - profile case .
Two major fraud cases were announced Wednesday .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged two traders with a $ 553 million fraud that came to light in an audit .
Another suspected Ponzi - style scam artist , James Nicholson , was charged with securities fraud and bank fraud for pilfering what could be more than $ 100 million of his clients ' assets .
Reed is a speck in the gold mine of fraud triggered by the disruption in the marketplace .
It 's amazing his crude methods were so successful .
Forty - five percent returns ?
Not even Madoff claimed such outrageous results .
The gold bugs finally have their villain .
His claims turned out to be as elusive as the Treasure of the Sierra Madre .
Arnold Kling , in addition to his insightful series of lectures on macroeconomics , has written a brief history of macro-econometrics .
In this history , he points out that most macro-econometric models embody strong priors of the model builder and that the forecasts need constant fudging to avoid being laughable .
Here is his conclusion :
We badly want macroeconometrics to work .
If it did , we could resolve bitter theoretical disputes with evidence .
We could achieve better forecasting and control of the economy .
Unfortunately , the world is not set up to enable macroeconometrics to work .
Instead , all macroeconometric models are basically simulation models that use data for calibration purposes .
People judge these models based on their priors for how the economy works .
Imposing priors related to rational expectations does not change the fact that macroeconometrics provides no empirical information to anyone except those who happen to share all of the priors of the model - builder .
If we have to " adjust " or " adapt " our models with new data and new variables according to our hunches and priors all the time , it does cast some serious doubt on the usefulness of the models .
Despite what all the talking heads have been reciting ever since the House stimulus vote , Republicans are n't helping themselves any with voters .
Indeed , it seems they are shooting themselves in the foot .
Charlie Cook -- aka someone who actually looks at data and does n't recite GOP talking points -- reports :
As polling very clearly shows , congressional Republicans have done nothing to help themselves by almost unanimously opposing the massive stimulus package .
Indeed , they look increasingly isolated : a narrow party that is looking inward for sustenance .
Selecting former Maryland Lt. Gov. Michael Steele to be national party chairman is about the only intelligent thing that Republicans have done since Election Day .
At this point , a Republican rebound seems more contingent upon a Democratic collapse than anything else .
Certainly , Republicans are n't doing anything these days to help bring themselves back .
As DougJ over at Balloon Juice notes , the American people overwhelmingly trust President Obama to help steer the country through these rough economic voters ... in historic numbers .

Obama administration defends telecom immunity in new brief Rachel Oswald
Published : Thursday February 26 , 2009
Print This Email This The Obama Justice Department continues to stand behind a Bush era law meant to prevent lawsuits against telecommunications companies accused of illegally sharing private customer information with intelligence agencies .
In a brief filed late Wednesday obtained by Raw Story , the Department of Justice provided its views to Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker , after the San Francisco federal judge questioned the constitutionality of the wide - sweeping law and whether it gives the U.S. Attorney General too much power in deciding whether a company is immune from lawsuits after it has shared information with federal agents .
The law was specifically designed to protect companies who participated in government wiretapping programs from legal claims and is one that President Obama supported as a senator when it was approved by Congress last year .
" Electronic communication service providers play an important role in assisting intelligence officials in national security activities .
Indeed , the intelligence community cannot obtain the intelligence it needs without assistance from these companies , " the Administration 's 18 - page brief says .
" The committee was concerned that , without retroactive immunity , the private sector might be unwilling to cooperate with lawful government requests in the future without unnecessary court involvement and protracted litigation , " it adds .
It continues : " The possible reduction in intelligence that might result from this delay is simply unacceptable for the safety of our nation , " directly citing the 2008 findings of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report .
According to the Justice Department , the law requires a judge to dismiss a wiretapping lawsuit against a telecommunications company if the attorney general explains the firm 's role to the judge in a confidential statement .
" The department is compelled to defend the statute as long as it can reasonably do so , and in this case the department was asked by the court to make a defense of the statute passed by Congress , " DOJ spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement accompanying the submission of the brief .
" The [ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance ]
Act passed by Congress in 2008 is the law of the land , and as such the Department of Justice defends it in court . "
The Justice Department brief was filed in support of the department 's motion to Walker to dismiss or to provide summary judgment in the lawsuit against AT&T for sharing customer telephone and e-mail records with federal agencies .
The constitutionality of the law is defended on the grounds that the attorney general is only carrying out powers specifically given to him by Congress .
The Department asserts that the " presumption of constitutionality becomes even stronger " when Congress delegates authority to the executive branch in matters of national security or foreign affairs .
" Congress supplied the requisite intelligible principle by specifically and narrowly defining the conditions under which the Attorney General may make a certification , and the statute 's legislative history provides further guidance , should any be necessary , " the brief reads .
" Under well - settled law , Congress may leave the decision whether and when to make a certification to the Attorney General 's discretion . "
" Congress provided the Attorney General an intelligible principle by enumerating specific and narrow circumstances in Section 802 [ of the Patriot Act ] that control whether and when he may make a certification , " it continues .
" The Act permits the Attorney General to certify facts to the court only when there is a pending civil action in which a person is alleged to have ' provid[ed ] assistance to an element of the intelligence community . ' "

SAN FRANCISCO , Jan. 28 ( UPI ) -- A California appeals court says a church school has the right to expel two homosexual students because the school is n't a business .
The 4th District Court of Appeal in San Francisco said California 's non-discrimination law applies to businesses and that Lutheran High School in Riverside was within its rights to kick out two girls .

The Los Angeles Times said Wednesday that the attorneys for the girls planned to appeal the ruling to the California Supreme Court .
The lawyers also said the ruling could justify any other type of discrimination by private schools as long as religious beliefs were cited .
" Basically , this decision gives private schools the license to discriminate , " said attorney Kirk Hanson .
The Times said the two plaintiffs were 16 at the time they were expelled and have moved on to college .
They have declined to comment on their sexual orientation .
The newspaper said the school expelled them after administrators determined their best - friends relationship was " characteristic of a lesbian relationship . "
OPEC is getting increasingly worried about global oil demand this year , potentially setting the stage for another round of production cuts next month .
In its latest monthly oil - market report , the oil cartel took a machete to its demand forecasts for 2009 , just as the rich - country energy adviser IEA did this week .
OPEC cut its global oil - demand forecast by 530,000 barrels a day compared with its outlook just one month ago .

Under Article 51 of the UN Charter , a state can take military action without the prior authorisation of the Security Council if it is acting in self - defence .
Yet , as CNN has reported , it was Israel – and not Hamas fighters – that broke the ceasefire .
On the November 4 2008 , Israel shelled the villages of Wadi al - Salqa and al - Qarara , killing six Hamas activists .
It is true that Israel has suffered from Hamas rocket attacks .
Insofar as these attacks indiscriminately target civilian areas , Hamas would be guilty of war crimes under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 .
Yet , in the past eight years , Palestinian rockets fired from Gaza have killed around 20 people in southern Israel .
Israel 's response is neither necessary nor proportionate .
At the time of writing , after 23 days of bombardment , more than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed by Israel , including 410 children and 104 women , while 5,300 are seriously injured , of whom 1,855 are children and 795 women .
Israel has shelled three clearly marked UN schools , the existence and GPS coordinates of which Israel had been repeatedly notified .
Israel has shelled the headquarters of UNRWA , the UN 's relief agency ( which is responsible with providing aid to 750,000 Palestinians ) , and it has shelled and bombed hospitals , ambulances , and medical personnel .
In typical Israeli fashion , it has bulldozed homes without warning in an attempt to bury the inhabitants alive .
Recent UN human rights reports expose that the Israeli army has deliberately used white phosphorus on civilians , which is prohibited " in all circumstances " under Protocol III of the Convention on Conventional Weapons , and evidence has emerged that Israeli snipers have deliberately targeted civilians .
On January 4 , Israeli soldiers evacuated approximately 110 Palestinians into a single - residence house in Zeitoun and warned them to stay indoors .
Half of the evacuees were children .
Twenty - four hours later , Israeli forces shelled the home repeatedly , killing 30 of the inhabitants , although more bodies are likely to be recovered from the ruins .
After several days of requesting safe passage to the area , on January 7 , during a three - hour lull in hostilities , an ICRC medical team was finally allowed in on foot ( without ambulances ) into the closed military area to evacuate any remaining survivors .
According to testimonies gathered by the UN , Palestinian children were left unable to walk or speak , in shock and weeping by the bodies of their dead mothers .
When the IDF finally let through the International Committee of the Red Cross , the children were led from the building past dogs eating the corpses of the victims .
Navi Pillay , the UN high commissioner for human rights and a former international criminal court judge from South Africa , has stated that the incident in Zeitoun " appears to have all the elements of war crimes " .
Israel has not ratified the 1998 Rome Statute , so its leaders cannot be brought before the International Criminal Court in the Hague , unless the UN security council itself refers Israel 's actions to the ICC .
The US abstained from the recent UN security council resolution calling for a ceasefire , and it would almost certainly wield its powers as a permanent member of the security council to veto any attempt to refer Israeli leaders to the ICC .
In UK law , the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 and the Geneva Conventions ( Amendment ) Act 1995 attempt to afford the domestic courts universal jurisdiction for " grave breaches " of humanitarian law .
This includes wilful killing , torture or inhuman treatment , wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health , extensive destruction and appropriation of property , which was not justified by military necessity and was carried out unlawfully and wantonly .
Attacks on the wounded , the sick , or against medical units and personnel also constitute grave breaches , as does making the civilian population the object of attack practices of apartheid and other inhuman and degrading practices involving outrages upon personal dignity , based on racial discrimination .
On September 10 2005 , the chief London magistrate Timothy Workman issued a warrant for the arrest of the retired Israeli Major General Doron Almog , in relation to the wanton destruction of 59 houses in Rafah refugee camp on January 10 2002 .
After Almog had landed at Heathrow , he was tipped off and he flew back to Israel .
Perversely , the attempt to bring Almog to justice for war crimes caused the then foreign secretary , Jack Straw , to apologise to his Israeli counterpart for the attempted arrest .
As Arthur Neslen has observed , it would seem that war crimes are fine , so long as someone says sorry afterwards .
Palestinians are living under occupation , and are therefore " protected persons " under the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 .
Protected persons may not be punished for crimes that they themselves have not committed , and their collective punishment constitutes a war crime .
Israel 's attempt to claim self - defence as a justification for the separation wall , which annexes swathes of Palestinian land , has already been rejected by the International Court of Justice .
On July 9 2004 , the International Court of Justice provided its advisory opinion that the construction of the wall is contrary to international law and that Israel was obliged to dismantle the wall forthwith .
The court rejected Israel 's defence that the separation wall is justified under the doctrine of self - defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter .
When the Middle East envoy for the Quartet , former UK prime minister Tony Blair , was interviewed by Gavin Esler on BBC Newsnight on January 9 , he opined that a ceasefire had not been possible because : " I think that there are still real issues about what can be done to stop the smuggling of the arms going into Gaza and then the opening of the crossings so that there can be proper humanitarian help . "
Blair effectively makes the Palestinians ' right to humanitarian aid dependent upon whether their democratically elected leadership can be prevented from bringing arms into Gaza .
Yet , as Article 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states : " To the fullest extent of the means available to it , the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population ; it should , in particular , bring in the necessary foodstuffs , medical stores and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are inadequate . "
It would appear that Blair regards international law as either irrelevant or a hindrance .
Despite the Israeli supreme court 's recent ruling in favour of the petitioner , the Foreign Press Association , that foreign journalists must be allowed into Gaza , the Israeli state prevented proper access throughout its attack .
As the FPA 's lawyer , Gilead Sher , observed : " There are several countries in this world , such as North Korea , Zimbabwe and Burma , that ban press coverage in conflict zones . "
Israel must ask itself whether this is really the company it wants to keep .
Muzak and its major creditor constituencies are committed to building upon the momentum gained over the past 22 days in an effort to continue , and ultimately complete , restructuring negotiations , which can be implemented on an expedited basis in Chapter 11 .
22 days of momentum seems quite spectacular and we are all rooting that it continues for at least another 22 days before the company has to liquidate its 50,000 in assets .
And before still employed restructuring bankers start screaming for pitch books , the company has been already working with bonvivant Thane Carlston of Moelis as financial advisor and Kirkland and Ellis as legal counsel since December 19

Rebalancing the Internet Imbalance of a 25 - Year Utopian Policy Experiment
SCOTT CLELAND CONTRIBUTOR
September 29 , 2020 11:38 AM
ET
The Internet is now less a technological revolution and more of an unravelling , 25 - year - old utopian policy experiment of freedom - without - responsibility .
There is no question that the Internet ’s many technological innovations have been a phenomenal success given that everyone everywhere conducts everything over the Internet .
However , the Internet has also been a 25 - year utopian policy experiment , and many of the Internet ’s foundational utopian premises – i.e. , a borderless , permissionless commons , open to everything and everyone , with no central or sovereign authority — have been unravelling or have largely collapsed .
In the 1990 ’s , the nascent Internet was viewed as a separate , virtual global dimension , ripe for utopian exceptions and experimentation .
There is limited value in returning to the Moon , according to a report co-authored by Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin ( Image : NASA / CAIB / Rick Stiles )
NASA ’s performance since the Apollo programme has been “ lacklustre ” and the agency needs “ serious reform or significant organisational overhaul , ” Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin and colleagues say in a draft paper released on Monday .
The draft paper , posted to the National Space Society blog , outlines a plan to replace George W Bush ’s 2004 Vision for Space Exploration , which called for returning astronauts to the Moon by 2020 , with a plan that focuses on sending astronauts first to new targets , such as asteroids .
A shorter version of the report will be released formally in a few days and sent to President Obama ’s administration for review , says Feng Hsu , the paper ’s primary author and an engineer at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .

The Apollo lunar programme of the 1960s and 70s was an “ astonishing success ” , the report says .
But it goes on to argue that “ post - Apollo NASA ” became a “ visionless jobs - providing enterprise that achieves little or nothing ” in areas such as the development of reusable or affordable launch systems .
The space shuttle , which costs about $ 450 million per launch and requires a lot of maintenance , is one of a number of “ wasteful projects with costly or unnecessarily complex and risky designs ” , the report says .
The report says the agency ’s downturn may have been inevitable , since Apollo had been a well - funded programme designed to beat the Soviet Union in the space race .
“ America ’s space program was destined to lose direction soon after winning the space race , ” the authors write .
No discussion
NASA ’s new Constellation programme is at “ high risk ” for continuing this downward spiral , they argue .
The programme , which is developing rockets and an Apollo - inspired crew capsule to replace the ageing space shuttle , will send astronauts to the space station as well as the Moon .
Bush ’s plan to return to the Moon was not vetted by space policy experts , politicians or the public through hearings and was not funded well enough to achieve its goals , they say .
Crucially , it also “ lacks strategic merit ” , the authors write : “ There is neither significant ( or short - term ) science value nor space exploration and operation value in revisiting an Earth - orbit destination that was explored by mankind four decades ago . ”
Instead , the authors say the US human exploration programme should focus first on sending astronauts to an asteroid or to L2 , one of five gravitational ‘ sweet spots ‘ around Earth ’s orbit .
There , spacecraft essentially could be parked so that they could keep pace with Earth on their orbits around the Sun .
Cabinet - level office
The authors say the site , which is farther away than the Moon , could host a space - station - like outpost .
It could also act as an intermediate step on the way to Mars , where human missions could initially be sent to Mars ’s moon Phobos before landing on the Red Planet itself .
If the US did return to the Moon , the venture should be part of larger commercial or international efforts , the authors say .
To explore those options better , the authors propose that a new cabinet - level office be developed – the US Department of Space .
It would take over from NASA and expand the agency ’s current efforts to work with businesses on space vehicles to reach destinations in low - Earth orbit , such as the International Space Station .
The department would also help spur the development of other technologies , including beaming solar energy down from space .
‘ Rearranging the bureaucracy ’
The recommendation to make the Moon an international target is “ much to be commended , ” says Louis Friedman of The Planetary Society , which last year made a similar call for US astronauts to aim for asteroids and Mars .
Friedman says
The Planetary Society was approached to sign on to the document , but Society officials have not yet decided to do so .
“ I think that it ’s overly critical of NASA , ” Friedman told New Scientist .
“ NASA still delivers a lot to America and to the world .
They have issues to solve , but they ’re normal issues .
They do it in the glare of a lot of publicity , ” he says .
“ I do n’t know that rearranging the federal bureaucracy is the solution to any problem NASA is encountering right now . ”
In a fiat world , money is printed into existence by the central bank - in the United States the Fed .
Given there is nothing backing up this money , it is inherently worthless .
However , one can think of as real .
It was printed ( even if only electronically ) , therefore it exists .
In addition to the previously mentioned money supply , fractional reserve lending allows credit to be extended by banks and financial institutions on top of that inherently worthless money .
Indeed , banks and financial institutions have leveraged credit to base money at ratios of 30 - 1 , 50 - 1 or even higher .
It 's pretty amazing if you think about it : Credit is extended with 30 - 50 times leverage on inherently worthless paper .
Ponzi Financing
Borrowers have to pay interest on the amount borrowed .
However , the interest and the debt cannot possibly be paid back except by an ever expanding Ponzi scheme of lending .
That scheme can last only as long as everyone believes the debt can be paid back and the market value of that debt keeps rising .
It 's a faith based system in which banks extend loans and hold the credit on the books ( or in many cases off the books in various structured instruments ) .
The banks are thought of as being well capitalized as long as the value of credit on the books in relation to their reserves meets some ridiculously low minimum set by the Fed .
This is how the system works , using the term " works " loosely .
Day of Reckoning
The day of reckoning comes when asset prices start falling , defaults soar , and the value of credit on the books starts plunging .
That day of reckoning has arrived .
And if leverage is high enough , as it was with Bear Stearns and Lehman , the institutions are wiped out overnight .
Citigroup ( C ) , Bank of America ( BAC ) , Fannie Mae ( FNM ) , Freddie Mac ( FRE ) and AIG are essentially in the same position of Lehman except the taxpayers via the Treasury are funding the bailouts .
Deflation Economics
Conditions today are essentially the same as during the great depression .
I talked about this in Humpty Dumpty On Inflation .
When I wrote that piece , I listed 15 conditions one would expect to see in deflation and the score was a perfect 15 - 15 .
I recently added a 16th : bank failures .
Click on link to see the conditions table .
Those who stick to a monetary definition of inflation pointing at M2 , M3 , MZM , or base money supply , as well as definitions that involve prices are selecting a definition of inflation that makes absolutely no practical sense .
It is the destruction of credit , coupled with the fact that what the Fed is printing is not even being lent that matters , not some Humpty - Dumptyish academic definition that has no real world application !
I have long been arguing that we are in deflation based on the following definitions : Inflation is a net expansion of money and credit .
Deflation is a net contraction of money and credit .
In both definitions , credit needs to be marked to market .
Mathematical Model
I can express the above mathematically .
Fm = Fb + MV ( Fc )
Fm = Fiat Money Total
Fb = Fiat Monetary Base
Fc = Fiat Credit , the amount of credit on the balances sheets of institutions in excess of Fb
MV ( Fc ) is the market value Fc
Inflation is an expansion of Fm
Deflation is a contraction of Fm
If only base money was lent out ( no fractional reserve lending ) , MV ( Fc ) would equal zero .
The equation ensures we do not double count credit in Fm .
MV is a function of time preference and credit sentiment ( ie. Belief that one can be paid back ) .
As long as that belief was high , banks were willing to lend .
Because ( at the moment ) Fc ( credit ) dwarfs Fb ( base money ) , the system can only hold together as long as there is belief credit can be paid back and as long as there are not defaults .
Needless to say , the perceived belief that Fc can be paid back is under attack , both by rising defaults , and by sentiment .
That is why MV ( Fc ) is collapsing .
In other words , the mark to market value of credit is contracting faster than base money is rising .
What About Deposits ?
Some may point out that base money is not the only real money out there .
Deposits are real .
Actually most deposits are fiction , borrowed into existence via an accounting entry and lent out with the miracle of fractional reserve lending time and time again .
Moreover , savings accounts have zero reserve requirements and the bulk of checking accounts which are supposed to be available on demand are swept nightly into savings accounts so that they too can be lent out .
However , the FDIC guarantees those deposits up to the FDIC limit , now at $ 250,000 per account .
Because of FDIC it might seem that deposits up to the guarantee limit should be accounted for in the above equation .
One could do that by adjusting the right side of the equation to allow for FDIC guarantees .
This would result in a peculiar formula of adding credit extended with 30 - 50 times leverage on inherently worthless paper to guarantees promised on that which does not really exit .
From a practical standpoint however , the economy seems to be acting as if base money and FDIC guarantees are irrelevant and the only thing that matters is the market value of credit .
Let 's explore why that is using a magical printing press as an example .
Magical Printing Press
Assume for a moment you invent a magical printing press .
Your machine can print hundred dollar bills so good that the US Treasury cannot distinguish them them from the real thing .
The bills are perfect in every way .
Now assume you print $ 5 trillion worth of those bills and bury them in your back yard .
Is this inflation ?
Surely not .
Would it be inflation if $ 5 trillion in bills were spent and entered the economy ?
You bet .
The key then is not how much the Fed prints , the key is how much of that money makes its way into the economy .
Please consider this audio with Austrian Economist Frank Shostak on Mises on September 30 , 2008 discussing recent actions by the Fed .
Will this printing create [ price ] inflation ?
This is dependent very much on what money will do next .
If banks will not lend and banks sit on that cash forever and ever like the great depression because the risk is too high and the banks do not know if the lending will end up in good assets or bad assets , and because banks are in so many bad assets now they probably will not lend at all .
That is the observation that Murray Rothbard made , that during the Great Depression that banks have chosen not to lend because the risk of accumulating bad assets was far to high .
So they were sitting on massive reserves .
That is what is developing right now .
A good example is what happened in Japan in 2001 - 2002 where the Bank of Japan pumped 300 % at one stage and lending continued to collapse .
I expect similar things to happen here .
If lending will not increase we can conclude this will not be inflationary .
Do n't Ask , Don't Sell Policy
Confusion due to delays ?
For many years we have been expecting inflation ( growth in the supply of money ) and nothing but inflation as far as the eye can see , but there have been times , such as the past 12 months , when we have felt more affinity with deflation forecasters than with most other inflation forecasters .
The reason is that monetary inflation , when measured correctly , was minimal during the first half of 2008 and during the two preceding years , thus setting the stage for a US $ rebound and large price declines in the investments that had been bid up to astronomical heights .
Based on our observation , a lot of confusion on the inflation / deflation issue is caused by the lengthy and variable time delays between changes in the monetary trend and changes in prices .
It will often be at least 2 years before the effects of a major change in the monetary trend start to become apparent in the prices of commodities and everyday goods and services .
Consequently , during the first 2 years of a new monetary inflation cycle the outward evidence will often point to deflation ( even though the inflation threat is rising ) , and for 2 years following the END of an inflation cycle it will seem as if the inflation threat is growing ( even though it is falling ) .
...
Current Situation
We agree with much of the analysis presented by the well - known deflationists .
The main point of contention revolves around the ability of the monetary authorities ( the Fed and the Treasury in the US ) to keep the total supply of money growing .
Our view has been , and continues to be , that the Treasury - Fed tag team has the power to promulgate monetary inflation under almost any economic circumstances and will use this power .
The bond market could eventually impose a practical limitation on the government 's ability to inflate because increasing the money supply becomes counter - productive once the bond market begins to anticipate rapid currency depreciation , but if price - related evidence continues to favour the deflation view over the coming year then this limitation will not arise anytime soon .
The case is not yet closed , but the evidence presented to date supports our view .
For example , the monetary base has expanded at an astronomical pace over the past five months .
Mike Shedlock has attempted to counter this by pointing out that a sharp increase in the adjusted monetary base ( AMB ) also occurred during the early 1930s , but the St. Louis Fed 's updated long - term chart of the AMB shows that the recent increase has been many times greater than anything during the 1930s .
In any case , the overall monetary situation today could hardly be more different to the early 1930s .
During the early 1930s the Fed increased the monetary base , but the total supply of money plunged .
Discussion On Points Of Contention
What About The Lag Theory ?
a lot of confusion on the inflation / deflation issue is caused by the lengthy and variable time delays between changes in the monetary trend and changes in prices .
Money Multiplier Lag Theory Is False
Two hypotheses about the nature of money can be derived from the money multiplier model :
1 . The creation of credit money should happen after the creation of government money .
2 . The amount of money in the economy should exceed the amount of debt , with the difference representing the government ’s initial creation of money .
Both these hypotheses are strongly contradicted by the data .
Testing the first hypothesis takes some sophisticated data analysis , which was done by two leading neoclassical economists in 1990 .
If the hypothesis were true , changes in M0 should precede changes in M2 .
Their empirical conclusion was just the opposite : rather than fiat money being created first and credit money following with a lag , the sequence was reversed : credit money was created first , and fiat money was then created about a year later :
“ There is no evidence that either the monetary base or M1 leads the cycle , although some economists still believe this monetary myth .
Both the monetary base and M1 series are generally procyclical and , if anything , the monetary base lags the cycle slightly . "
Thus rather than credit money being created with a lag after government money , the data shows that credit money is created first , up to a year before there are changes in base money .
This contradicts the money multiplier model of how credit and debt are created : rather than fiat money being needed to “ seed ” the credit creation process , credit is created first and then after that , base money changes .
Solid Evidence Credit Is Created First
To make certain that the GSEs have adequate funds to cover potential losses , OFHEO ( like all financial regulators ) imposes capital requirements .
At the end of 2007 , the two GSEs had a $ 24.8 billion surplus over the regulatory capital requirement of $ 58.4 billion ; they had a surplus of $ 50.8 billion over the risk - based capital requirement of $ 38.8 billion .
These amounts can be compared with the combined retained mortgages portfolios of $ 1.434 trillion and the $ 3.501 trillion in MBS that the GSEs guaranteed for a total of $ 4.934 trillion .
The regulatory capital surplus amounted to 0.50 % of the $ 4.934 trillion and 1.03 % of the risk - based capital surplus .
If the GSEs were to face losses in excess of their income by these percentages , they would be forced to either reduce their capital requirements by selling mortgages and MBS from their portfolios or to raise new capital from investors .
The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to lend the GSEs $ 2.25 billion each , but this is more a symbolic amount than a total solution .
Based on Fannie Mae ’s issuance of $ 1.588 trillion in short term debt in 2007 , the $ 2.25 billion would have lasted less than 12.5 hours .
Based on the $ 598.6 billion issued of short term debt that Freddie Mac issued in 2007 , the $ 2.25 billion would have lasted just under 33 hours .
Base Money Yet Again
USA Money Stock Measures and Debt
Measured on this scale , Bernanke ’s increase in Base Money goes from being heroic to trivial .
Not only does the scale of credit - created money greatly exceed government - created money , but debt in turn greatly exceeds even the broadest measure of the money stock — the M3 series that the Fed some years ago decided to discontinue .
Bernanke ’s expansion of M0 in the last four months of 2008 has merely reduced the debt to M0 ratio from 47:1 to 36:1 ( the debt data is quarterly whole money stock data is monthly , so the fall in the ratio is more than shown here given the lag in reporting of debt ) .
To make a serious dent in debt levels , and thus enable the increase in base money to affect the aggregate money stock and hence cause inflation , Bernanke would need to not merely double M0 , but to increase it by a factor of , say , 25 from pre-intervention levels .
That US $ 20 trillion truckload of greenbacks might enable Americans to repay , say , one quarter of outstanding debt with one half — thus reducing the debt to GDP ratio about 200 % ( roughly what it was during the DotCom bubble and , coincidentally , 1931 ) — and get back to some serious inflationary spending with the other ( of course , in the context of a seriously depreciating currency ) .
But with anything less than that , his attempts to reflate the American economy will sink in the ocean of debt created by America ’s modern - day “ Roving Cavaliers of Credit ” .

Another portion of boomer retirement plans is being wiped out in the stock market crash .
Toy accumulation is out .

A drug that stimulates the body ’s tanning response — turning pasty skin caramel for up to two months — has been approved for human trials , but not for tanning .
Although the drug will not be available for cosmetic purposes any time soon , similar compounds are already being widely abused on the pharmaceutical black market .
The official product , a man made hormone called afamelanotide , has received U.S. government approval to begin clinical trials .
" It ’s a bioabsorbable implant that you just inject into the skin , " said Colin Mackie , director of business development for Clinuvel , the company bringing the drug to the U.S.
" It stimulates melanin production . "
Melanin is the body ’s natural pigment .
It ’s responsible for the color of skin and protects humans from harmful solar radiation .
The drug will be tested as a treatment for patients who face serious danger from the sun ’s rays , like those with rare genetic diseases or who must take immunosuppressants , Mackie said .
But online retailers already offer a similar ( but not identical ) compound under a more descriptive brand name , Melanotan II , which American and British health officials warn are already being abused .
" Using it could be dangerous to short and long - term health , " British health officials said in November .
It has not been tested for safety , quality or effectiveness and we do n’t know the potential side effects yet . "
This week two British Medical Journal researchers warned that injecting the compound could change the size and shape of moles , which under normal circumstances can be a precursor to skin cancer .
Melanotan ’s plight highlights the difficulty in bringing drugs with large recreational or cosmetic potential to market for decidedly more medical conditions .
Before the drugs can make it through safety and efficacy trials , rogue users — almost like pre-release movie filesharers — begin to test the drug on themselves .
These high - demand , off - label uses could make regulatory agencies reluctant to approve the pharmaceutical for legitimate uses .
Both Melanotan
I and II are synthetic cousins of a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the production of melanin , the skin ’s pigment .
But Melanotan II , in particular , appears to have aphrodisiac and erectile function effects as well .
First created and tested back in the late ’ 80s at the University of
Arizona , the synthetic tanning hormone received media attention from around the world .
Tom
Brokaw , in a 1991 broadcast , said that medical researchers had announced
" what could be the answer " to tanning without the skin damage associated with the process .
Wired first featured melanotan back in 2002 , dubbing it the " Barbie drug " for its purported ability to induce weight loss and increase libido .
The label has stuck and is often used in the press
But the drugs were a good idea in search of a disease .
Fair - skinned people ’s desire to be tan is not a disease , and the tanning behaviors it induces could cause skin damage and cancer .
Now , though , Clinuvel has found five , admittedly obscure , medical conditions that the drug could treat .
Over the last several years , the Clinuvel ’s CEO , Philippe Wolgen , has battled to make his drug sound less and less sexy .
" This will not be a cosmetic drug , ” Wolgen told a biotech trade publication last year .
“ I oppose systemic treatment for cosmetics . ”
He changed the company ’s name from the provocative Epitan to the boring Clinuvel .
It might not make for great advertising copy , but the CEO ’s moves appear to have paid off .
" The FDA ’s decision is a landmark event in Clinuvel ’s growth , " Wolgen said in a release this week .
" Today ’s progress reflects some of the choices we had to make in our program early on in 2006 when changing the direction of the company . "
But even as he tries to position his drug to be taken seriously , industry analysts following his company know that the drug could be a blockbusters on the cosmetics market .
After all , once a drug is approved by the FDA for one purpose , it ’s easier to extend it to new conditions , just like the glaucoma - treatment turned eyelash enhancer .
" [ Melanotan ] has potential as a ‘ Life Style ’ drug for those millions of p eople who prefer just a darker tint , " a German analyst wrote back in 2004
[ pdf ] .
" Market research has shown that the product has blockbuster potential in particular when used as a ‘ Life Style ’ drug , which draws a strong comparison to Botox or Viagra , two products with booming sales today . "
Hopeful tanners took it upon themselves to deliver on that blockbuster potential as Melanotan languished in the pharmaceutical industry ’s basement .
Recent British media reports indicate widespread use of the compound .
Purportedly , the drug is ordered online and comes in a white powder that is mixed with sterile water .
That combination is injected into the abdomen .
One woman told the Daily Mail that she intended to keep using the injections despite their unknown provenance and possible side - effects .
" At first , injecting myself in my tummy seemed strange , but now I do n’t even think about it — the needle is so fine I hardly feel it , " she said .
" And I am so pleased with the results that despite the adverse publicity I ’m going to continue with them . "
An online forum dedicated to Melanotan has more than 50,000 posts , most of which are about " Usage and Experimentation . "
Many describe detailed regimens for attaining darker skin and / or improved sexual function .
Here in the United States , Melanotan II appears widely available online , although the FDA warned Tennessee ’s Melanocorp , which bills its product as " 100 % US Made Melanotan II , " to
stop shipping to Americans in 2007 .
The company continues to ship to European countries .
The company provides a dozen or so purported before - and - after pictures , like the photo above .
Though the results could be suspect , they look eerily similar to results obtained in trials at the
University of Arizona or by Clinuvel ( images at left ) .
In early animal trials , injections of the drug caused a yellow dog ’s fur to become black and visibly darkened a frog ’s skin in minutes .

Detectives investigating a string of ATM explosions have arrested two men at gunpoint in Sydney 's south - west overnight .
In the past six months there have been dozens of ATM blasts , mainly across Sydney , but also on the New South Wales central coast and one at Warrawong on the south coast .
Strike Force Piccadilly II has been under growing pressure to make a breakthrough on the case , with only three people arrested so far .
About 3:30 am ( AEDT ) , police from the Tactical Operations Unit arrested two men - one 23 years old , the other 25 - outside a bank on The Boulevard at Punchbowl .
Police seized a BMW sedan , which they suspect is stolen , and say they found gas cylinders in the car .
The men were questioned at Campsie Police Station , and police say they have now been charged .
Police expect both men to face Burwood Local Court later today .
They have asked anyone with information that might assist detectives with their ongoing inquiries into the ATM explosions to contact Strike Force Piccadilly II via Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .
In one of the most holy weeks in the Christian calendar , a report says that in just over a generation the number of people attending Church of England Sunday services will fall to less than a tenth of what they are now .
Christian Research , the statistical arm of the Bible Society , claimed that by 2050 Sunday attendance will fall below 88,000 , compared with just under a million now .
The controversial forecast , based on a " snapshot " census of church attendances , has been seized upon by secular groups as proof that the established church is in decline .
But the Church of England has rejected the figures , saying they were incomplete and ignored new ways of worshipping outside the church network .
According to Dr Peter Brierley , former executive director of Christian Research , by 2030 just under 419,000 people will attend an Anglican Sunday service .
By 2040 the number will be down to 217,200 , falling to 153,800 five years later .
By 2050 , if the trend prediction is correct , only 87,800 will be attending .
The figures stand in contrast to the picture of faith described by the prime minister earlier this month .
In a preface to a new report , Faith in the Nation , Gordon Brown said : " Faith in Britain today is very much alive and well .
At the last census , more than three - quarters of the population said they belonged to a faith ... people 's religious identities go right to the heart of their sense of themselves and their place in society and the world . "
Keith Porteous - Wood of the National Secular Society said : " Church attendance has already been in decline for over 60 years , all over Britain , in all major denominations and across all age groups , except the over - 65s .
Independent statisticians now have enough data to predict confidently that the decline will continue until Christianity becomes a minority sect of largely elderly people , in little more than a generation . "
The forecast was made by Christian Research in its annual statistical publication , Religious Trends .
Benita Hewitt , the organisation 's new executive director , said she accepted that the figures were disputed and stressed she did not believe they showed people were turning away from religion .
" As with all forecasting , we are living in rapidly changing times at the moment and it is very difficult to predict what things will look like in the coming years , " she said .
The Reverend Lynda Barley , head of research and statistics for the Archbishops ' Council , said the figures represented only a " partial picture " of religious trends , adding : " Church life has significantly diversified so these traditional statistics are less and less meaningful in isolation . "
Studies suggest figures for Sunday attendance represent only 58 per cent of the number of people who attend in an average month .
Attendance at Church of England cathedral services has been growing , while church groups have attracted new congregations by holding meetings in venues such as pubs or at car boot sales .
Two weeks ago , analysts at Credit Suisse attacked one of the scariest charts of the era , the one showing the record - high mountain that is total US debt to GDP :
The chart , the CS analysts said , combined two different statistics and suffered from double - counting .
Specifically , the analysts said , the " financial debt " segment counted whole loans and asset - backed securities as different types of debt when in reality asset - backed securities just repackage whole loans .
( $ 1 billion of mortgage - backed securities and $ 1 billion of mortgages do n't make $ 2 billion of debt ) .
Ned Davis of Ned Davis Research was one of those who produced the original Debt To GDP chart , and he now defends it .
He does n't dispute the double - counting charge .
He simply notes that , even if you exclude financial - sector debt , US debt levels are very high .
Recently someone in our office gave
me an article from analyst Henry Blodget ,
who excerpts a study from Credit Suisse
( that a client sent me ) , that says my chart
E501A is a “ false idol ” that is “ technically
wrong and analytically meaningless . ”
They call my chart “ arguably the most
dangerous piece of propaganda to come
out of the current crisis . ”
They argue
our chart uses “ spliced data ” from two
different sources , and current data is really
not comparable to the 1929 period .
I have had many other criticisms of
my debt chart over the years .
The most
frequent is that by including financial
debt , I am double - counting some loans .
This was a key point in the CS report .
After seeing some $ 1 - 2 trillion in toxic
assets ( loans ) that banks have made , I
am now astounded that anyone would
currently want to ignore financial debt .
In any case , the chart [ below ]
leaves out financial debt , comes directly
from one source , the Fed ’s flow of funds
report , and does not compare with the
1920s .
While the levels are obviously
lower without financial debt , it shows that
current record debt levels are well above
the mean for the past 60 years .
It is not
technically wrong and anyone is free to
derive their own meaning .
By the way , here 's Ned 's original chart , the one the CSFB analysts are objecting to :
He also thought that this was a good idea , in fact necessary .
It was necessary because , as he put it , " the common interests elude public opinion entirely " and can only be understood and managed by a specialized class of responsible men who are smart enough to figure things out .
This theory asserts that only a small elite , the intellectual community that the Deweyites were talking about , can understand the common interests , what all of us care about , and that these things " elude the general public . "
This is a view that goes back hundreds of years .
It 's also a typical Leninist view .
In fact , it has very close resemblance to the Leninist conception that a vanguard of revolutionary intellectuals take state power , using popular revolutions as the force that brings them to state power , and then drive the stupid masses towards a future that they 're too dumb and incompetent to envision themselves .
Maybe there will be a popular revolution , and that will put us into state power ; or maybe there wo n't be , in which case we 'll just work for the people with real power : the business community .
But we 'll do the same thing :
We 'll drive the stupid masses towards a world that they 're too dumb to understand for themselves .
Lippmann backed this up by a pretty elaborated theory of progressive democracy .
He argued that in a properly - functioning democracy there are classes of citizens .
There is first of all the class of citizens who have to take some active role in running general affairs .
That 's the specialized class .
They are the people who analyze , execute , make decisions , and run things in the political , economic , and ideological systems .
That 's a small percentage of the population .
Naturally , anyone who puts these ideas forth is always part of that small group , and they 're talking about what to do about those others .
Those others , who are out of the small group , the big majority of the population , they are what Lippmann called " the bewildered herd . "
We have to protect ourselves from the trampling and rage of the bewildered herd .
Now there are two functions in a democracy :
1 . The specialized class , the responsible men , carry out the executive function , which means they do the thinking and planning and understand the common interests .
2 . The bewildered herd , and they have a function in democracy too .
Their function in a democracy is to be spectators , not participants in action .
But they have more of a function than that , because it 's a democracy .
Occasionally they are allowed to lend their weight to one or another member of the specialized class .
In other words , they 're allowed to say , " We want you to be our leader " or " We want you to be our leader . "
That 's because it's a democracy and not a totalitarian state .
That 's called an election .
But once they 've lent their weight to one or another member of the specialized class they 're supposed to sink back and become spectators of action , but not participants .
That 's a properly functioning democracy .
And there 's a logic behind it .
There 's even a kind of compelling moral principle behind it .
The compelling moral principle is that the mass of the public is just too stupid to be able to understand things .
If they try to participate in managing their own affairs , they 're just going to cause trouble .
Therefore it would be immoral and improper to permit them to do this .
We have to tame the bewildered herd , not allow the bewildered herd to rage and trample and destroy things .
It 's pretty much the same logic that says that it would be improper to let a three - year - old run across the street .
You do n't give a three - year - old that kind of freedom because the three - year - old does n ' tknow how to handle that freedom .
Correspondingly , you do n't allow the bewildered herd to become participants in action .
They 'll just cause trouble .
So we need something to tame the bewildered herd , and that something is this new revolution in the art of democracy : the manufacture of consent .
The media , the schools , and popular culture have to be divided .
For the political class and the decision maker shave to give them some tolerable sense of reality , although they also have to instill the proper beliefs .
Just remember , there is an unstated premise here .
The unstate premise -- and even the responsible men have to disguise this from themselves -- has to do with the question of how they get into the position where they have the authority to make decisions .
The way they do that , of course , is by serving people with real power .
The people with real power are the ones who own the society , which is a pretty narrow group .
If the specialized class can come along and say , I can serve your interests , then they 'll be part of the executive group .
You 've got to keep that quiet .
That means they have to have instilled in them the beliefs and doctrines that will serve the interests of private power .
Unless they can master that skill , they 're not part of the specialized class .
So we have one kind of educational system directed to responsible men , the specialized class .
They have to be deeply indoctrinated in the values and interests of private power and the state - corporate nexus that represents it .
If they can get through that , then they can be part of the specialized class .
The rest of the bewildered herd just has to be basically distracted .
Turn their attention to something else .
Keep them out of trouble .
Make sure that they remain at most spectators . "
- Noam Chomsky , ( Excerpt : " Media Control : The Role of Media in Contemporary Politics , " New York , Seven Stories Press , 2002 .

The liberal democratic theory and Marxism - Leninism are very close in their common ideological assumptions .
I think that 's one reason why people have found it so easy over the years to drift from one position to another without any particular sense of change .
It 's just a matter of assessing where power is .
So it looks like wannabe cloner Psystar 's supposedly hotshot law firm of Carr and Ferrell regrouped for a deep think after pumping out some fairly weak arguments in its case against Apple -- according to a new draft of Psystar 's countersuit , the Florida - based computer reseller should be allowed to sell whitebox Mac OS X machines because it legally purchased copies of Leopard at retail .
That 's the first sale doctrine , if you 're into copyright law -- it states that the purchaser of copyrighted materials ( like a book ) can sell or dispose of them however they want .
Here 's the thing though : a big part of Apple 's case ( but not all of it ) is based around the fact that consumers license OS X under the terms of the EULA -- and courts are basically up in the air over whether the first sale doctrine should apply to software transactions .
It 's an interesting tactic with a ton of repercussions beyond Apple if it 's successful , but we honestly can't see it working -- in the cases where first sale has been used to overcome a EULA , it 's generally been for used software , not companies like Psystar , who are modifying and installing new copyrighted software sold by a first party .
We 'll see how Apple responds -- things just got interesting again .
World Of Apple notes that this argument has been present from the outset , but it sounds like Psystar 's really pushing it now .
We 'd say so -- we think it 's the only plausible one we 've heard so far .

In an unintended consequence of Israel 's offensive in Gaza last month , sales of Palestinian olive oil in Britain are soaring , importers have said .
The devastating conflict , in which 1,300 Palestinians were killed , has prompted a surge in demand for the product in apparent sympathy for the Palestinians .
Equal Exchange , a seller of Fairtrade products , reported a threefold increase in sales of olive oil from the West Bank in January compared with a year ago .
" We have run out of one - litre bottles and we expect sales to double to 400 tonnes this year compared to 2008 , " said Barry Murdoch , the sales director of Equal Exchange .
The company Zaytoun , also established to sell Palestinian olive oil in the UK , reported a fourfold rise in sales last month instead of the usual post - Christmas lull .
Zaytoun , established by two Britons , Heather Masoud and Cathi Pawson , takes its name from the Arabic word for olive .
The surprise sales increases coincide with a publicity drive for Palestinian products during Fairtrade fortnight , which runs from 23 February to 8 March .
Nasser Abufarha , the chairman of the Palestinian Fairtrade Association , is touring the UK to support the launch of the world 's first Fairtrade Palestinian olive oil .
Winning Fairtrade certification is an important breakthrough for Palestinian oil producers , as they will now have access to mainstream British supermarkets such as Co-op , which has been working closely with Equal Exchange to get Palestinian products on to the shelves .
Fairtrade also means better prices for olive growers .
" We have been working for the Fairtrade certificate for four years , " said Abufarha , who has campaigned against the building of Israel 's security barrier .
" Fairtrade will increase our sales , and bring us new markets and widen our reach . "
The farmers were sceptical at first , Aburarha said , as they could not imagine why anyone would pay them above the market price , but they were willing to give it a try .
And the certification was about more than price , he said .
" We have given farmers hope .
An economic exchange that recognises Palestinian farmers ' rights and respects the value of their connection to their land , after marginalisation under Israeli occupation , is a major accomplishment . "
Olives are the most cultivated tree crop for Palestinian farmers , and more than 100,000 people work in the industry .
But farmers face severe difficulties because of the security situation .
Orchards have been bulldozed in the course of the conflict , and to make way for new settlements .
The village of Anin , west of Jenin in the West Bank , has seen 1,100 hectares of olive orchards cut off by Israel 's security fence .
Permits from the Israeli authorities are difficult to obtain and there are severe time constraints for visits , making it so hard for farmers to tend to their trees that some have given up altogether .
The Palestinian Fair Trade Association is attempting to work with farmers in nine cooperatives – about 2-400 farmers in each – to develop fair trade practices .
Aburaha says some of them have processes that stand comparison with the best Italy has to offer .
Palestinian Fairtrade olive oil is not cheap , with one litre of extra virgin oil from Equal Exchange retailing at £ 14.99 ; one litre of olive oil from Puglia can be found for as little as £ 6 .
But Zaytoun and Equal Exchange believe consumers will be willing to pay premium prices for the Fairtrade label .
In recent years , Fairtrade products such as tea and coffee have seen strong growth in sales , although this may change with the increasing severity of the economic downturn .
In terms of taste , Palestinian olive oil is a hit with foodies .
The River Café is so impressed with Zaytoun olive oil that it wants to try other Zaytoun products , from olives to almonds .
And the food and wine writer Malcom Gluck described Zaytoun as " one of the least aggressive yet pungently attractive olive oils I have tasted " , and ranked it alongside the best of the fruity Sicilian , Cretan and northern Spanish oils .
Chris Matthews takes Darrell Issa to task on Hardball for using the term " Democrat Party " .
Matthews :
Well , I think the Democratic Party calls itself the Democratic Party , not the Democrat Party .
Do we have to do this every night ?
Why do people talk like this ?
Is this just fighting words to get the name wrong ?
Issa :
This is n't intended to be fighting words .
Matthews :
They call themselves the Democratic Party .
Let 's just call people what they call themselves and stop the uh , the Mickey Mouse here .
Save that for the stump - seriously .
Issa : Chris , Chris .
Matthews :
Now let 's get to the issue here , seriously we 've got a fiscal challenge .
I want to go back to Congressman Frank and to some English here .
Congressman Frank are you worried about the size of these WWII numbers here ?
Again , 1.75 trillion deficit this year .
A spending level of almost 4 trillion .
We 're almost running deficits as big as the revenue number we 're bringing in .
Frank : Well Chris let me first of all come to the defense of my colleague Mr. Issa and the Republicanistical Party that he represents , um and say that ah ...
Issa : Thanks Barney .
Frank :
You 're welcome there Darrell .
The point is this .
For him to say oh these are the Democrat 's deficits .
I have never seen people disavow their own handiwork so quickly .
And I knew that born again was an important strain , in in our society but born again deficit haters , it 's a new version .

Business reporter , BBC News
Wall Street denizen and alleged mega - fraudster Bernard Madoff began his financial career at the age of 22 with just $ 5,000 .
Mr Madoff's whole legacy has been destroyed , say investors Taking the money raised from summer holiday jobs working as a lifeguard and garden sprinkler installer in the New York borough of Queens , he set up the investment firm that bore his name in 1960 .
Now , after nearly half a century of trading , his reputation is in ruins , as he faces allegations that his entire business was nothing more than a $ 50 bn ( £ 33 bn ) scheme to dupe investors .
With his alleged victims asking why US regulators failed to query what was going on , it seems that the way in which Mr Madoff operated was key to the success of his venture .
While those who knew him describe him as " affable " and " high - profile , but not in a loud way " , he went to great lengths to cultivate an aura of exclusivity .
Many of his richest clients were recruited in private chats at upmarket country clubs in New York and Florida , giving them a sense of belonging to a privileged circle of those in the know .
Then he used those big names to attract other investors , until his influence extended to international banks , hedge funds and even charitable foundations .
' Money heaven '
No -one seems to know yet what exactly has happened to all that money .
Mr Madoff is quoted in the US Attorney 's criminal complaint against him as saying that he has " absolutely nothing " .
WHAT IS A PONZI SCHEME ?
A fraudulent investment scheme paying investors from money paid in by other investors rather than real profits Named after Charles Ponzi who notoriously used the technique in the United States in the 1920s Differs from pyramid selling in that individuals all tend to invest with the same person
Whether he is supposed to have squandered it , stashed it or simply lost it on the markets has yet to emerge .
In the words of hedge fund boss Douglas Kass , of Seabreeze Partners Management : " It appears that at least $ 15bn of wealth , much of which was concentrated in southern Florida and New York City , has gone to money heaven . "
Mr Madoff 's dealings were certainly pretty opaque .
As well as his original company , Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities , he ran an entirely separate investment advisory business , which is the firm implicated in the alleged fraud .
He never outlined his trading methods or how he generated the healthy returns on his investors ' money .
Somehow , in bad times as well as good , he was able to pay out 10 % or more every year .
" It 's a proprietary strategy .
I ca n't go into it in great detail , " he once said .
Prosecutors now think they know all too well what Mr Madoff's " proprietary strategy " was : using money from new investors to pay off old ones , in a form of illegal investment known as a Ponzi scheme , after one of its earliest exponents .
Regulatory gap
So why did this dubious state of affairs not come to the attention of the regulators sooner ?
Well , the answer probably lies in a combination of Mr Madoff 's personal prestige and some carefully exploited gaps in the system .
Worried investors gathered at the offices of Bernard Madoff in New York
As a former chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange with a string of other directorships and a generous donor to charitable causes , he was a man who inspired confidence .
As for the regulators , the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regularly inspected Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities , but not the separate investment advisory business .
That firm ran a hedge fund which was not registered with the SEC until September 2006 - and , according to reports , never inspected thereafter .
Even so , details have now emerged of earlier SEC inquiries into Mr Madoff 's dealings .
The SEC said last week that his securities operation was investigated in 2005 and found to have violated rules requiring brokers to get the best possible price for orders .
A second SEC inquiry , in 2007 , apparently uncovered no irregularities .
Jail sentence Mr Madoff is said to have told FBI agents that there was " no innocent explanation " for the collapse of his investment scheme .
Many wealthy people appear to have been wiped out by the alleged fraud , while financial institutions around the world are counting the cost .
Saddest of all , some charities are being forced to close because of their losses .
Mr Madoff himself has been released on $ 10 m bail .
But if the charges against him are proven , he could face a jail sentence of up to 20 years and a fine of up to $ 5 m .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
Gene sleuths who have come up with a rough draft of the Neanderthal DNA code said on Thursday the ancient relatives of modern humans shared with us one gene for speech , but little else .
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany and 454 Life Science Corp , a Roche company , said they have sequenced more than 60 percent of the entire Neanderthal genome .
Preliminary results confirm what the group had already suspected : that Neanderthals , humanity ’s closest relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
“ Our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
It ’s tiny , ” Svante Paabo , who is heading up the effort at the Max Planck Institute , told reporters in a video conference .
Neanderthals lived in Europe and parts of Asia until about 30,000 years ago , when Cro-Magnon people , the ancestors of modern humans , moved in .
The group is working to get a complete Neanderthal gene map , which they plan to compare to the previously sequenced human and chimpanzee genomes in the hopes of gaining more insights about how Neanderthals differed from humans .
Paabo said the analysis so far confirms that humans and Neanderthals had the same variant of the FOXP2 gene known to play a role in speech .
“ We can not say from this they could speak .
We can just say there is no reason to assume they could n’t speak from what little we know , ” he said .
The team wants to look at other genes , including those involved in brain aging and development , he said .
So far , the two groups have sequenced a total of more than 1 billion fragments of Neanderthal DNA , generating a first draft sequence of the entire Neanderthal genome .
The researchers have had to devise computer programs that detect whether changes in the ancient DNA were due to chemical damage over time , or to contamination with modern human DNA from handling .
Most of the DNA sequences come from bones from Vindija Cave in Croatia , which has proven to be a particularly rich source of Neanderthal DNA .
But the team is looking for new fossils that can be carefully excavated to minimize human contamination .
And Paabo said given the age of the ancient DNA , using cloning technology to try to resurrect a Neanderthal is out of the question .
“ It is and will remain impossible , ” he told reporters .
Paabo said the team hopes to publish detailed findings later this year .
The former Saturday Night Live comedian Al Franken took the lead yesterday in a recount of the virtually tied US Senate race in Minnesota .
The Democrats are banking on victory to strengthen their Senate majority and help turn President - elect Barack Obama 's ambitious agenda of reform into law with minimum delay .
Mr Franken 's campaign announced that , for the first time since the recount began , he had pulled ahead of the Republican Senator , Norm Coleman .

The prospect of the controversial former entertainer joining the Senate has created a stir , although it may be weeks before the result is declared .
The race is so close that it is a near certainty that whatever the result of the recount , the courts will become involved in deciding the outcome .
However , a Republican victory in a re-run election in Georgia on Tuesday has already denied Mr Obama a 60 - seat " super- majority " in the Senate , which he needed to override any Republican filibuster tactics .
In Minnesota , Mr Franken 's campaign claimed he was ahead of Mr Coleman by 22 votes .
There are 138,000 ballots left to count , with 94.3 per cent of the vote already counted .
Thousands of ballots remain in limbo following challenges .
Officials are going through ballots box by box , looking for errors or ballots which were not counted on election day .
One such box , left aside after a voting machine broke down , gave Mr Franken 91 votes and Mr Coleman 54 .
In Georgia , Senator Saxby Chambliss trounced his challenger Jim Martin 58 to 42 per cent , giving the Republicans a ray of sunshine in a bleak landscape .
Even the star powers of the former president Bill Clinton , his vice president Al Gore and the rapper Ludacris were not enough to persuade black voters in particular to revote .
The defeat highlighted some of Mr Obama 's limitations now the euphoria of his election has receded .
It is increasingly hard for the Democrats to pin the country 's huge economic problems on the Republicans .

And it is an awkward time for Mr Obama , who is holed up in Chicago acting as a sort of shadow president .
He holds daily press conferences but does not have the authority to do much beyond make appointments to his cabinet and issue advise to Democrats in Congress as they grapple with the country 's deteriorating economy .
Yesterday , Mr Obama announced the appointment of New Mexico's Governor , Bill Richardson , as Commerce Secretary , the latest in a rapid - fire series of appointments to his cabinet before his 20 January inauguration .
The appointment is a consolation prize for Mr Richardson , who had high hopes of becoming Secretary of State before Hillary Clinton was picked .
He is set to be the most prominent Hispanic in the Obama administration .
Mr Richardson developed a sideline career as a freelance diplomat while governor , dashing off to North Korea , Sudan , Cuba and Iraq and holding press conferences to announced diplomatic breakthroughs , to the consternation of the Bush White House .
Mr Obama said Mr Richardson was a leading " economic diplomat " and the " best person for the job " .
In the Georgia re-run election , Mr Chambliss campaigned on denying the Democrats a clean sweep in Congress and stressed his opponent would tax and spend with abandon .
Perhaps wisely , Mr Obama did not show up in Georgia , thereby keeping the shine on his political image as he prepares for future battles .
And with 60 seats for the Democrats no longer a possibility , Mr Franken 's fortunes have lost some of their urgency .
Speaking out Franken lets fly

am a creature of Congress , " said Leon Panetta with a broad smile , which was returned by equally wide smiles from members of the Senate intelligence committee meeting yesterday to consider his nomination to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency .
I really wish he had n’t said that .
For that sobriquet fits the worst of the worst , so to speak , of former CIA directors  the tarnished Medal of Freedom awardee , George Tenet .
He too mastered the art of grinning in Congress .
When nominated to lead the CIA , his distinctive cachet was said to be that , as staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee , George was " equally popular on both sides of the aisle . "
Those of us who had been around a while knew this to be no cachet , but rather the kiss of death for intelligence work .
His insatiable need to please his masters famously led George in Dec. 2002 to yell " slam dunk , " when former president George W. Bush asked about evidence of " weapons of mass destruction " in Iraq .
That same desire to please , bordering on the obsequious , showed through Panetta ’s performance at his nomination hearing on Thursday and Friday .
There was little sense that the man who nominated him , Barack Obama , had won a decisive election victory and was determined to exorcise the flock of evil spirits possessing the White House of Bush and Cheney , in whose abuses many of those same Senators had acquiesced .
Obama did set the stage for the hearing by issuing executive orders against torture and other crimes .
And , to his credit , Panetta did stand firm in defending the new policies and exposing as a false choice the one between greater security and preserving our nation ’s values .
Otherwise , though , the nominee appeared unnecessarily deferential .
Worse still , he let a number of familiar lies fly by without challenge .
here was no real need for him to let the unreconstructed partisan Orrin Hatch ( R , Utah ) browbeat him into supporting one of the familiar canards promoted by the late Bush administration .
Hatch insisted , twice , that Panetta subscribe to the bromide that CIA analysts " were relying on world - wide intelligence at the time , " and that " every major intelligence community " in the world shared the view of U.S. intelligence regarding WMD in Iraq .
Can we not , at long last , dispense with this canard ?
Repeating it does not make it true .
And were it to have been true , then how does one explain why Bush and U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair could not get the U.N. Security Council approval they knew would be required in order to make an attack on Iraq legal .
Those foreign intelligence services that chose to give credibility to the " intelligence " coming from the U.S. and U.K. did so because they had little or no independent evidence of their own , and their governments wished not to alienate Washington .
And some intelligence analysts  in the Australian and Danish services , for example  did warn their governments about what the British press ended up calling the " dodgy dossier " of U.S. - U.K. faux intelligence on WMD in Iraq .t the risk of damning with faint praise , Panetta is clearly twice as bright as the folks he will replace as CIA director .
So , it should have been easy  had he been paying closer attention , or had he insisted upon being adequately briefed  to cite the Senate intelligence committee ’s own report , released on June 5 , 2008 , on prewar intelligence on Iraq .
That study , five years in the making , was approved by a vote of 10 to 5 , with Sen. Chuck Hagel ( R , Nebraska ) and Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R , Maine ) joining the majority .
It concluded that the public statements of the highest Bush administration officials on WMD were not supported by the intelligence .
In releasing the report , then - chair Jay Rockefeller ( D , West Virginia ) stepped out of character and spoke plainly : " In making the case for war , the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact , when in reality it was unsubstantiated , contradicted , or even non-existent . "
And Diane Feinstein ( D , CA ) , who is now committee chair , attached this note to the report :
" The results are now in this administration distorted the intelligence in order to build its case to go to war .
" Thus , it was hardly the case that " everybody " believed there were WMD in Iraq , but rather just those who chose to acquiesce in the distortion of intelligence and those countries that used to trust the intelligence coming from Washington .
It is a safe bet that Feinstein and Rockefeller were disappointed by Panetta ’s inability or unwillingness to cite the committee ’s own official findings as a way to squelch Hatch . ommittee ranking member , Christopher Bond ( R , Missouri ) met no challenge from Panetta when Bond enlisted another familiar canard ; i. e. , that the Bush - era harsh interrogation programs  described by Bush as an " alternative set of procedures "  helped to prevent future attacks .
There is not a shred of evidence to support this claim .
On the contrary , there is abundant evidence that those same interrogation programs have been the most effective recruiting tool for al - Qaeda and other terrorists .
Again , Panetta ’s ignorance on this key issue , or  more likely  his bending over backwards to be conciliatory , can hardly have impressed committee members .
Replying Thursday to a question from committee chair , Sen. Diane Feinstein , Panetta gave assurance that the CIA would perform no more extraordinary " renditions for torture . "
The very suggestion that this might have been the case in the past raised hackles with Sen .
Bond , who went off in dogged pursuit .
And at Friday ’s session , Bond was able to squeeze a retraction out of Panetta , who would not stick to his guns.t took Sen .
Levin to adduce on Friday the quintessential example of the " effectiveness " of extraordinary rendition .
" When you mistreat or torture people , particularly with waterboarding , then they can give you false information and you can end up taking action on the basis of false information , " said Levin  a little too subtly for the TV audience .
With tongue in cheek , Levin referred to the case of Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi , an al - Qaeda functionary who was captured and " rendered " to Egypt , where , under torture , he told his interrogators what he knew they wanted to hear .
Levin duly noted that al - Libi ’s " false information was part of the reason adduced for going to war . "
But then  too much the gentleman to risk causing unpleasantness with Bond and his colleagues on the other side 
Levin pretended not to remember whether al - Libi had been tortured .
Al - Libi had been identified by the Defense Intelligence Agency as a likely fabricator months before the Bush administration began to use his statements to " prove " that Iraq had been training al - Qaeda .
Without mentioning al - Libi by name , President Bush , Vice President Cheney , then - Secretary of State Colin Powell and other administration officials repeatedly cited information from his interrogation as credible evidence that Iraq was training al - Qaeda members in the use of explosives and chemical weapons .
So , you see , torture can indeed provide the information you may lust after to grease the skids for war .
Al - Libi was the poster boy for the Cheney / Bush torture regime ; that is , until he publicly recanted and explained that he only told his interrogators the magic words he knew would stop the torture .
pity that Panetta appeared completely unaware of the case of al - Libi and how the proceeds of his extraordinary rendition and interrogation in Egypt had been used .
Or perhaps he was aware , but reluctant to feed Bond ’s distemper .
A pity , too , that the nominee did not consult with former intelligence officers like Milt Bearden , a 30 - year veteran of CIA ’s operations directorate who rose to the most senior managerial ranks .
He has written : " The administration ’s claims of [ torture ] having ‘ saved thousands of Americans ’ can be dismissed out of hand because credible evidence has never been offered
It is irresponsible for any administration not to tell a credible story that would convince critics at home and abroad that this torture has served some useful purpose this is not just because the old [ intelligence ] hands overwhelmingly believe that torture does n’t work  it does n’t  but also because they know that torture creates more terrorists and fosters more acts of terror than it could possibly neutralize .
" Bearden argued that if the claims of the Bush White House were true , it ought to stop hiding always behind the all - too - readily - adduced need to protect sources and methods .
He noted that in 1986 after the U. S. bombed Libya in retaliation for a Libyan operation that killed U.S. servicemen in Berlin , there was worldwide skepticism and consternation .
The Reagan administration decided it owed the world an explanation and decided it would be worth sacrificing a very sensitive method ; namely , the ability to intercept Libyan encoded messages .
Ironically , the Libyan message that was made public bragged that the operation had been carried out " without leaving a trace behind . " n his opening remarks Thursday , Sen .
Bond expressed concern that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D , CA ) has said , as Bond put it , " certain people associated with the interrogation program should be prosecuted . "
Bond wondered aloud if Panetta would agree with Pelosi , but then droned on and did not afford him a chance to answer .
But the possibility of prosecution quickly moved front and center in a line of questioning from Sen. Carl Levin ( D , Michigan ) .
Here Panetta did some squirming in trying to square a circle .
In an obvious effort to avoid fouling the nest he is about to occupy at CIA , he tried mightily to argue that individuals who were told that torture techniques like waterboarding were legal " ought not to be prosecuted or investigated " for following the guidelines from the attorney general and department of justice .
Pursued by Sen .
Bond like a junkyard dog at Friday ’s session , Panetta went further , disavowing any intention to " go into the past . "
Bond tacked on a gratuitous warning to the effect that , were Panetta to delve into the past , he ( Bond ) could " not imagine anything more detrimental to morale at the CIA .
" But Sen .
Levin would not let Panetta off the hook .
" Can torture be made legal by a legal opinion ? " he asked .
Panetta replied that , as a lawyer , his view was that those guidelines were " a stretch .
" Levin extracted a commitment from Panetta to cooperate with the committee in looking into past practice .
( It remains unclear which promise Panetta intends to keep  the Thursday one to Levin , or the Friday one to Bond . )
The nominee eventually conceded under Levin ’s questioning that , as both Obama and newly confirmed Attorney General Eric Holder have emphasized , " no one is above the law . "
Panetta added that , for those eventually shown to have deliberately violated the law , " obviously in those cases there should be prosecutions . "
But that was Thursday .
hursday turned out to be a full day of pondering what happens when Mafia - style lawyers are cited by the actual " deciders " on issues like torture .
On Amy Goodman ’s Democracy Now , human rights lawyer Scott Horton noted that both Bush and Cheney have acknowledged on TV their involvement in decisions on torture , justifying their decisions ( on waterboarding , for example ) thusly : " We talked to the lawyers , and the lawyers told us it was okay .
" Horton noted that the most senior Bush administration official responsible for dealing with the Guantanamo tribunals , Susan Crawford , had concluded that detainee al - Kahtani had in fact been tortured .
Since his treatment had been approved by Cheney and Bush , " Both are linked to a case that their own principal agent considers to have been torture , " said Horton .
He and Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights , stressed that Attorney General Holder thus has " an absolute obligation to begin a criminal investigation , " under Articles 4 and 5 of the Convention Against Torture .
Ratner offered the following as " the best argument as to why you need criminal prosecutions . "
Referring to the prominent photo showing Obama signing the executive orders prohibiting torture , Ratner said all he could think of was that the next president might sign executive orders going the other way .
Ratner : " Our fundamental rights , the right to be free from torture , should not be dependent on the length of the president ’s arm .
The only real deterrent is prosecution . " ichael Ratner added that he found it difficult to listen to the president suggesting we have to look forward and not backward , because to him ( Ratner ) prosecutions are precisely the things needed to look forward .
" They tell you why we are not going to have torture in the future . "
He and Horton called for the immediate appointment of a special prosecutor who can begin to open investigations ; Ratner also noted " the Obama administration is in violation of the Convention Against Torture if it does not commence an investigation .
"
Now this is the last thing the James and Kit Bonds of this world wish to see , for then their efforts to muzzle potential whistleblowers would founder on the rocks of subpoena and oath .
Meanwhile , though , we can expect the Bush - Cheney apologists to do all they can to intimidate those in the ranks who may be prompted to come forward voluntarily .en .
Bond has done all he can to put a price on the head of whistleblowers in the intelligence community .
On Aug. 2 , 2006 , for example , he actually suggested that leakers be Guantanamo - ized : " There is nothing like an orange jumpsuit on a deliberate leaker to discourage others from going down that path , " said Bond .
At the recent confirmation hearings for Dennis Blair for the post of Director of National Intelligence , Bond pressed the nominee on whether he would try to prosecute leakers of classified information .
Blair passed Bond ’s test : " If I could ever catch one of those [ leakers ] , it would be very good to prosecute them ; we need to make sure that people who leak are held accountable , " said BlairIt is a measure of what Washington has become that there is bipartisan consensus on the need to prosecute leakers but not torturers .
Panetta , Blair , and others may wish to consider this : had there been some real teeth in whistleblower protection for members of national security agencies , chances would have increased that some courageous soul would have come forward and exposed the lies that led to catastrophe in Iraq  and might conceivably have headed it off .
Perhaps most would now agree that this kind of person would truly merit a Medal of Freedom  not an orange jumpsuit .

Roscosmos Eyes New Station
by Staff Writers
Moscow ( RIA Novosti ) Jan 30 , 2009
Krasnov also said Roscosmos would propose extending the use of the International Space Station ( ISS ) until 2020 .
The orbital assembly of the ISS began with the launch of the U.S. - funded and Russian - built Zarya module from Kazakhstan on November 20 , 1998 .
Zarya , which means ' dawn , ' was the ISS 's first component .
Russia 's Federal Space Agency ( Roscosmos ) will propose to the government the construction of a low - orbit space station to support future exploration of the Moon and Mars , an agency official said Thursday .
" We will soon propose to our government a project to construct a low - orbit complex , which could serve as a foundation for the implementation of the lunar program and later on - the Mars program , " Alexei Krasnov , director of manned flight programs at Roscosmos , told a news conference in Moscow .
Krasnov said that Russia , as well as other countries , " is looking at the Moon in a mid-term perspective , and would want not only to go there and come back , but to establish a lunar base , which would allow us to start exploring Mars in the future . "
" These are our intentions , but we are working hard to ensure that these plans get adequate financial and legislative support from the government , " the official said .
Russia , a pioneer in robotic lunar research , abandoned its lunar exploration program with the end of the Moon race in the mid-1970s , but the idea of exploring the Earth 's natural satellite has been revisited recently , due to ambitious international projects to develop the Moon 's resources and to use it as a stepping - stone for further space exploration .
Roscosmos earlier said its first unmanned flight to the Moon would include a lunar orbiter to fire 12 penetrators across diverse regions to create a seismic network .
These will be used to research the origins of the Moon .
Krasnov also said Roscosmos would propose extending the use of the International Space Station ( ISS ) until 2020 .
The orbital assembly of the ISS began with the launch of the U.S. - funded and Russian - built Zarya module from Kazakhstan on November 20 , 1998 .
Zarya , which means ' dawn , ' was the ISS 's first component .
The project has taken longer than the planned five years , and as of July 2008 the station was approximately 76 % complete .
" We are considering the extension of ISS service life at least until 2020 , but this decision must be adopted by the governments of all 15 countries participating in the project , " Krasnov said .
The project currently involves NASA , Roscosmos , the Canadian Space Agency , Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) , and 11 members of the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .

As a communication and community - building tool , blogging is up there with Twitter as a key social media platform .
A place to both offer and share opinions as well as a view at the person behind an online persona , a blog is more than just a personal or business journal – it ’s your voice .
There are many blog platforms , tools and plug-ins around , all with various benefits .
Some are better than others and depend on your own needs .
Here are 10 of mine .
Since it ’s my platform of choice , these are mainly based around WordPress .
Self - hosted blogging .
While free blogging ( Blogger , WordPress.com , MySpace , etc ) is a great starting point , self - hosted ( WordPress.org , TypePad , Squarespace ) is definitely the way to go .
For sheer optimization and personalization options , it ’s hard to beat .
Buy a domain name for about $ 10 and then get a web hosting package for less than $ 4.00 per month .
Premium theme .
There are some great free theme designs for WordPress , and Smashing Magazines has a list of 100 free themes .
If you ’re willing to pay , however , you can get a premium theme .
There are some great ones from iThemes , Thesis , WooThemes and Revolution .
There ’s also great support for premium theme members that you do n’t always get on free ones .
Analytics .
Knowing who your main audience is can help you tailor your blog more effectively .
Of course , writing for you first should always be the aim and hopefully others will like it too .
There are some great tools for monitoring your readers .
Two I use are Woopra for actual traffic analytics and Quantcast for more in - depth information on demographics .
And they ’re both free too .
Technorati is also a great way to see who ’s referencing your blog .
Comments .
An integral part of the blogging experience is the comments section .
Giving you insight into what your readers think , comments are a great relationship builder between blogger and reader .
CommentLuv is a plug - in that shows your visitor ’s last post and a great way to show blog link love ( coming here soon ) .
Threaded comments using IntenseDebate or Disqus are also great tools to encourage conversation and debate .
Offer an option to subscribe to comments as well , so your readers can keep up with an ongoing conversation .
Images .
Picking images for your blog can be a pain .
Finding the right ones can take time and often copyright is involved – so services like those offered by Zemanta or fotoGLIF are a major plus .
Zemanta offers you a choice of Creative Commons - approved images , as well as links and a reblog option to share your post , while fotoGLIF offers more than 1 million free to use and copyright - free images .
PhotoDropper also offers a great service for licensed images .
( Disclosure – I ’ve previously carried out some PR work for fotoGLIF ) .
Feeds .
Gaining readers is part and parcel of blogging , so making it easy for them to find and come back to your blog helps .
Your blog will normally have a standard RSS feed , but offering more options will benefit you and your readers .
One of the most popular is Feedburner , which allows your readers a choice of feeds or email subscription .
Other options include Feedblitz , Feedstats and Feedity .
Make your options visible – you ’ll see mine at the top right of my blog .
Navigation .
Make it easy for your readers to navigate your blog .
Offering something as simple as a search box lets anyone look for a certain topic .
Lijit makes it even easier by not only searching your blog , but any content from your social networks on the topic as well as that of your contacts .?
Use your blog sidebars to offer topic breakdowns as well , so readers can go straight to posts that interest them .
The Yet Another Related Posts Plug - in shows similarly - themed posts that your readers might also enjoy .
Sharing is good .
The great thing about social media and networking is the selfless sharing of information .
So make your blog another resource of information by offering the option for readers to share something they ’ve enjoyed .
Share This and Tell - a- Friend are two customizable options to share your blog on other social networks .
They can help you gain new readers too .
Google is your friend .
While having a loyal readership is great , it ’s always nice to get new visitors as well to join your existing subscribers .
Make your blog easier to find by optimizing it for search engines .
The All - in - One SEO pack is a great plug - in that helps you stand out with keywords and search terms .
If you use the Thesis theme , this has a similar option already built in .
Protect your work .
While blogging is a great way to build community and friends , it ’s also open to plagiarizing , with many bloggers victims of RSS thieves that post your content as their own .
One way to counter this is with Better Feed .
This allows you to place your copyright in your RSS ?
feeds and email subscriptions and ensures that any “ borrowed ” work will link directly back to you with your copyrighted message .
These are just some of the tools I use .
As I mentioned , they are skewed heavily towards WordPress , although some will work on other blogging platforms as well .
Yet as good as they are , they ’re just a small window into all the great blogging options around .
What do you use for your blog ?
Any not on here that should be must - haves ?
Hetrosexual couples in France turn to ' gay ' civil partnerships to avoid expensive divorces
Heterosexual couples in France are choosing ' gay ' civil partnerships over marriage
Heterosexual lovers in France are increasingly taking part in ' gay ' civil partnership ceremonies so as to avoid the future possibility of expensive divorces .
The intriguing development has led to 90 per cent - or 135,000 a year - of so - called ‘ solidarity pacts ’ being made between people of the opposite sex .
This is despite the fact that they were specifically designed for homosexuals , who are not formally allowed to marry across the Channel .
The Civil Solidarity Pacts , or PACS according to their French language abbreviation , take just 15 minutes and can be performed by a court clerk .
Just as significantly , they can be ended with a single letter from either partner , without any claims on the other ’s money or property .
With divorce costs spiralling in France as they are in Britain , such a legal arrangement is particularly attractive to those potentially facing massive payouts if marriages fail .
Currently some 150,000 couples are ‘ PACSed ’ in France every year , meaning around 135,000 of them are heterosexuals .
The PACS provide near - identical financial and administrative protection as formal marriages , including the possibility of providing joint tax returns and enjoying deductions .
Inheritance laws also favour PACSed couples , allowing property and cash to be passed on as it would be between a husband and wife .
French councils also treat PACSed couples like married couples when assigning benefits or accommodation .
The PACS also allow couples to bypass social and Church conventions , many of which are viewed as outdated by younger generations .
Yves Padovani , chief clerk at the Marseille Palais de Justice , said : ‘ It ’s a very efficient system , with people booking a slot in advance , and each ceremony taking a few minutes . ’
Mr Padovani confirmed that the PACS were introduced 10 years ago so as to legalise unions between gay couples .
In 1999 around 6000 took place , but the annual figure is now 25 times that amount - and steadily rising .
The social stigma of being unmarried has now disappeared in France , with 43 - year - old Justice Minister Rachida Dati , who is single , this year giving birth while in office .
Ségolène Royal , the Socialist Party presidential candidate who unsuccessfully stood against Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 , is also an unmarried mother of four .
Civil partnerships were made legal in Britain in 2004 , giving same - sex couples rights and responsibilities identical to those who have taken part in civil marriages .
This includes the possibility of hugely expensive divorces between any couple who is bonded by a civil partnership .
Bobby Jindal is a very smart fellow .
Back when he was in Congress , I ’d try to check in with him every six months or so , just to see what he was thinking about .
At first , we talked about health insurance –his specialty .
Then , about the federal response to Hurricane Katrina ( he was appalled ) .
He was fairly relentlessly conservative , but sometimes quite creative and always intellectually honest .
In short , a different fellow from the one who appeared on Meet the Press today .
This Jindal was relentlessly conservative , but not so intellectually honest .
The Governor of Louisiana has made headlines this week by threatening to refuse the stimulus package funds headed to his state .
But he ’s not going to do that , really .
He ’s going to accept all the money heading his way –except for the funds associated with one program , a permanent change in the rules governing the provision of unemployment insurance to part - time workers .
He spent an awful lot of time griping about the overall stimulus package–although , in the end , that was pretty much a distortion , too .
When it came down to it , Jindal did n’t like the aforementioned unemployment insurance provision and the slight trims on tax breaks for small businesses .
He also did n’t like some of the infrastructure spending –on high - speed rail .
He also did n’t like $ 50 million orginially proposed for the National Endowment of the Arts .
( I ’m not even sure that famous $ 50 million made it into the final bill , although I hope it did : a country whose children have a more supple knowledge of music and art will , without question , have more sophisticated and productive workers . )
To summarize : Jindal opposes the unemployment codicil , the slimmer tax breaks for small businesses , the support for high - speed rail and the money for the arts .
That leaves the overwhelming bulk of the stimulus package , which he presemably supports .
A fair question would have been : Governor Jindal , if you were given a take it or leave it choice on the entire package headed for your state , would you take it or leave it ?
The answer , of course : he ’d take it .
And so would nearly every one of the Republicans who hooted and howled and grandstanded against the bill .
They had the luxury of voting against it because they knew it would pass .
I ’d venture to say not a single Democrat who voted for the bill was 100 % pleased with it .
Many probably had objections as substantive , and ultimately as peripheral , as Jindal’s .
But they voted for the bill because they are now the majority party and it would have been irresponsible , given the economic free - fall , not to do so .
At one point in the interview , Jindal–who seems to be running for President–trotted out the standard Republican boilerplate about the need for a package with more tax cuts , especially in the capital gains tax .
David Gregory pointed out that we ’d just had eight years of that philosophy , and it had n’t done very much to help job creation or median incomes .
Jindal resorted to the Republican fantasy playbook –to the Kennedy and Reagan tax cuts , which allegedly helped boost the economy .
( Actually , it was the Carter - Volcker monetary reforms that set the economy on a more stable path for growth in the early 1980s . )
Needless to say , Jindal did n’t mention either the Reagan tax increases ( proportionately the largest in U.S. history ) or the slightly smaller Clinton increases , which led to the lowering of interest rates and the economic boom of the 1990’s .
Nor did he mention the 30 years of neglect the nation ’s infrastructure has suffered during the Reagan era–not just the neglect of roads and bridges and levees , but also of the sorts of high - tech and green infrastructure programs ( including mass transit and high - speed rail ) that will lay the basis for a more efficient economy in the future .
In other words , Jindal –the alleged voice of the GOP future –had absolutely nothing new to say .
And what he did say , about the stimulus , was purposefully misleading .
I ’m not sure how well the Obama stimulus , banking and budget plans will work .
No one does .
But I do know how the philosophy and the misleading politics that Jindal offered today has worked in the recent past .
It ’s been a disaster .
Brian Kenny , chair of governors at Tranmere 's Mersey Park primary where Megan and Jack attend , said : " I will be speaking to the local authority immediately about this .
This seems to be an horrific situation and above all else our first priority is doing all we can to address the welfare of the children . "
米アップル はMacworld Expoにて、今年3月までにコンテンツ配信サービス「 iTunes Store」の楽曲をすべてデジタル著作権管理なし（DRMフリー）にすると発表した（関連記事）。
このアップルの 「 大きな一歩」は、どのような流れの中で決断されたことなのだろうか？
ジャーナリストの津田大介氏に音楽配信の最新事情を聞いた。
市場を変えたの は 「 Amazon MP3 」だった
── DRMフリーというアップルの決断について、どう評価されますか？
津田 DRMフリー化は時間の問題だと思っていました。というのも、米アマゾンが2007年10月からDRMフリーのMP3を販売する音楽配信サービス「 Amazon MP3」を始めていたからです（関連記事）。
米国の4大メジャーレコードは、今回、iTunes Storeへの提供を始める前から、DRMフリー／256kbpsの楽曲をAmazon MP3で販売していました。MP3の楽曲なら、iPodやiPhone、iTunesでも扱えるので、わざわざiTunes
Storeを使う必要がない。しかもAmazon MP3は、「薄利多売」戦略を採って、同業他社より安い価格を付けて販売していましたから。
今までアップル は 「 FairPlay」という独自のDRMを使い、iPodやiTunesを囲い込んできたため成功してきました。しかし、そのDRMがじょじょに足かせになってきて、iTunes
Store がAmazon MP3 に「食われる」ようになった。今回はそうした問題を解消しようという決断でしょう。
加えて 、Macworld Expoの基調講演では、iTunes Storeのダウンロード数について触れられていましたが、この販売ペースが以前に比べて落ちてきている。iTunesは割と飽和していて、ライバルが伸びてきているという裏付けだと思います。そういう意味でも、テコ入れをしたかったということでしょうね。
今回のDRMフリー化によって高くなる音源もありますが、旧譜などは逆に安くなるものも多い。そのあたりデジタル音楽の新たなニーズの掘り起こしを狙っているのだと思います。
Trolltech developer Jens Bache - Wiig is working on a new style engine for Qt that can leverage the user 's default GTK + theme .
This will make it possible for Qt applications to optionally share the GNOME look and feel when they are running in the GNOME desktop environment .
Qt has long had custom platform - specific styles that use native system theming APIs to provide a higher level of visual consistency on Windows and Mac OS X , but the toolkit has always drawn its own widgets on the Linux platform .
The result is that mixing KDE and GNOME applications often results in an aesthetically confusing experience .
This problem can be mitigated easily on KDE with a special GTK + theme engine that uses
Qt widgets , but there was n't previously any equivalent for GNOME users .
Qt 's current GNOME visual integration solution is the Qt QCleanlooks style , which is designed to loosely mimic GNOME 's default Clearlooks engine .
Bache - Wiig 's new QGtkStyle , which uses real GTK + theming APIs , provides a much higher level of visual consistency than QCleanlooks and makes simple Qt applications virtually indistinguishable from GTK + applications .
Qt Designer with QGtkStyle
" Now that 4.4 is out , I finally found the time to kick off some new development and one of my pet projects these days is QGtkStyle .
We already have QCleanlooks , icon themes , standard shortcuts and dialog buttons to integrate with GNOME , but to achieve true perfection we need to use the Gtk theme engine directly just like we do on Mac and Windows , " Bache - Wiig wrote in a blog entry .
" QGtkStyle does exactly this , and in addition extends and surpasses QCleanlooks in a lot of other areas as well .
All group boxes are now flat style to blend better with GNOME dialogs .
Icon theme support has improved , scrollbar buttons are disabled at edges and item view branches now support hover . "
I tested it on Ubuntu 8.04 with Qt 4.4 and was very impressed with the quality .
It 's still experimental , but I found it entirely usable with Qt Designer , Dolphin , KWord , and other complex applications .
I tested it with Ubuntu 's default Human GTK + theme and with my own relatively complex Murrina - based GTK + theme .
It was able to support most of Murrine 's advanced features , including menu and scrollbar striping , but had a little bit of trouble with the gradient line that runs along the left edge of menus .
QGtkStyle and the Human theme
QGtkStyle and my custom theme
The source code is available for download from Trolltech 's SVN repository , but remember that you will need Qt 4.4 to make it work .
After the style has been compiled and installed , you can activate it for KDE applications with the KDE 4 systemsettings tool and for Qt applications with the Qt 4.4 qtconfig tool .

A survey of leading economists finds them now forecasting a far deeper and more painful recession ahead in the first half of the year , but a modest pickup in the second half of 2009 , followed by a solid recovery in 2010 .
" The steady drumbeat of weak economic and financial market data have made business economists decidedly more pessimistic on the economic outlook for the next several quarters , " said Chris Varvares , the president of the National Association of Business Economics , which conducted the survey of 47 top forecasters in late January and early February .
" While a few reports offer some glimmer of hope , a meaningful recovery is not expected to take hold until next year , " added Varvares , who is also president of the research firm Macroeconomic Advisors .
The forecasts hold little good news for the first half of this year .
The economy is expected to decline at a 5 % rate in the first quarter , even sharper than the 3.8 % drop recorded in the fourth quarter of last year .
And the group is forecasting another 1.7 % drop in economic activity in the second quarter .
While the economists surveyed are forecasting a 1.6 % gain in economic activity the second half of this year , that wo n't be enough to overcome the first half weakness , which should result in a 0.9 % full - year drop in U.S. economic activity when comparing the fourth quarter of this year to a year earlier .
That would be the biggest drop on that basis since 1982 , and far worse than the year - over - year decline of 0.2 % recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
As recently as NABE 's November survey , the consensus of economists was that there would be 0.7 % economic growth during the course of 2009 .
Last May 's survey found the group forecasting a healthy gain of 2.7 % during the year .
But the outlook for this year has clearly gotten much worse since the earlier surveys in just about every measure .
The economists are forecasting unemployment rising to 9 % for the fourth quarter of 2009 , up from their previous 7.5 % estimate .
They expect job losses for the year coming in roughly the same as the nearly 3 million jobs lost in 2008 , which is nearly four times the job losses they were forecasting three months ago .
They also estimate corporate profits will slip 9 % this year , while housing starts and auto sales continue to fall to levels not seen in decades .
All those forecasts are significantly worse than estimates in the November survey .
The economists are forecasting a healthy recovery in stocks from current levels , estimating the Standard & Poor 's 500 will end the year a 975 , which would be 26 % above current levels and a gain of 8 % from where it started the year .
But in November the economists had forecast the S&P would end 2009 at 1,200 .
Still , the optimism that the economists had back in November has been pushed back , rather than abandoned .
They forecast that the economy will see healthy 3.1 % growth during the course of 2010 , as they expect unemployment to start to ease as employers add 1.3 million jobs during the year , and auto sales and housing starts at least make it back to 2008 levels .
Even the five most pessimistic economists surveyed are forecasting economic growth during every quarter of 2010 , although those pessimists expect job losses and the unemployment rate to continue throughout all of next year .
The United States is seen as the most likely major economy to emerge from the global recession first , according to the survey .
The survey found 34 % expect the U.S. back on its feet first , followed by 28 % who believe China would be the first to recover and 13 % who picked Canada .
Less than 4 % picked European economies as the most likely to lead the recovery .
Couple told they cannot have their children back after being wrongfully accused of abuse to take court battle to Europe
A couple forced to give up three children for adoption despite a judge ruling they may have been wrongly accused of abuse yesterday vowed to take their legal fight to Europe .
Mark and Nicky Webster said they will never give up the battle to win back their daughter and two sons after the Appeal Court ruled this week that it was ' too late ' for the family to be reunited .
The couple have not seen the children , now aged nine , seven and five , since they were put up for adoption four years ago .
Flight from home : Mark and Nicky Webster with Brandon in Ireland
Mrs Webster , from Cromer in Norfolk , said : ' We promised right from the very beginning that we were going to fight on no matter what .
' That has not changed , despite all the disappointments we have suffered .
' We need to discuss with our lawyers exactly where we stand but we will do whatever we can .
' If that means going to House of Lords or all the way to the European courts then that 's what we will do .
' I 've never stopped thinking about my children and I never will . '
The couple 's nightmare started in October 2003 when Mrs Webster took their second son to hospital with a swollen leg .
He was found to have a number of small fractures which doctors said could be caused only by physical abuse .
The following year they were permanently removed and put up for adoption after a one - day court hearing .
Court win :
The Websters had wanted a re-hearing of the care proceedings to challenge the adoption order
Medical experts later concluded that the injuries were not caused by violent twisting and shaking , but were symptoms of rare case of scurvy .
Mr Webster , 35 , and his 27 - year - old wife fled to Ireland in 2006 to stop their fourth child , Brandon , being taken into care at birth .
The Appeal Court ruled on Wednesday that even though the Websters ' may well ' have been victims of a miscarriage of justice the adoption order on their eldest three children could not be revoked because the youngsters are now settled with their adoptive parents .
Mrs Webster , who is pregnant with a fifth child due in April , said : ' The judgement has left a lot of unanswered questions .
' On the one hand they are saying it 's in our favour and they fully understand why we 're doing what we 're doing .
' But on the other hand they 're saying they can't help us .
' I'm also disappointed that they have n't cleared our names .
' The judges only skimmed the surface .
They have n't dug deeper .
' You see cases on the news about people harming their children .
It 's beyond belief that we were put in a similar pigeon hole to that .'
Helen Broughton , an adoption law specialist from Morecrofts Solicitors , said the case highlighted the ' chronic weaknesses ' in the Family Justice System .
' A tragic situation like this has almost certainly happened before and sadly it will very likely happen again , ' she said .
' There is a serious shortage of resources .
Medical experts are expensive and courts are only required to provide one for each adoption case , which allows no room for error .
' Had there been a second medical opinion when concerns were first raised about this couple this whole very sad situation would almost certainly have been avoided . '
But she warned that the Websters would face a very tough battle to overturn the adoption order in either the House of Lords or the European Court of Justice .
' The courts may rule that they have been wronged , but they are extremely unlikely to reverse the adoption order , because in almost all cases adoption is final . '
Mansa Musa Muhummed , who beat , tortured and starved his children for decades , was sentenced to seven life terms in prison today by a judge in Murrieta who said the man ’s " reign of terror " against his family merited the harsh sentence .
" Mr. Muhummed showed no remorse and accepted no responsibility for his twisted behavior , and the court is sending the strongest message possible , " Riverside County Superior Court Judge F. Paul Dickerson III said .
Some of Muhummed ’s 19 children urged the court to show no mercy to their father because he showed no mercy to them .
" I ’m very afraid of him , please do n’t let him ever get out of jail , " said Sharon Boddie , who was locked up in a dark garage and starved by her father .
When police found her , she was 18 and weighed 48 pounds .
" I still have nightmares about him , ” she told the judge .
“ Parents are supposed to protect their children , not abuse them . ”

One of the most fascinating pieces of history rewriting in recent years has been the transformation of Chirac into a raging lefty , now thankfully toppled by a ' real ' rightwinger , Sarkozy .
Sarkozy 's election has been described as transformative , a clean break from Chirac 's knee - jerk anti-Americanism ( as if he had n't been welcomed , when elected , as the most pro-American president ever ) , his unseemly hostility to the war in Iraq ( as if he had n't called that one correctly ) , the 35 - hour week ( promoted under Chirac 's rule , but by a socialist government ) and his caving - to - the - lefty - mob tendancies ( as if the strongest person in his last several governments , and the all - powerful inspirer of his aggressive law 'n ' order and anti-immigrant policies had not been Nicolas Sarkozy himself ) .
Today , we are beginning to see the same rewriting of history with respect to president Bush - except that the goal is not to present the November election as a transformative one , but as a non-event whereby one president continues the same spendthrift policies of his quasi-Democrat predecessor .
In a big opinion article today with a rather explicit title ( ' Atlas Shrugged ' : From Fiction to Fact in 52 Years , the Wall Street Journal seriously explains this :
these acts and edicts sound farcical , yes , but no more so than the actual events in Washington , circa 2008 .
We already have been served up the $ 700 billion " Emergency Economic Stabilization Act " and the " Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act . "
Now that Barack Obama is in town , he will soon sign into law with great urgency the " American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan . "
This latest Hail Mary pass will increase the federal budget ( which has already expanded by $ 1.5 trillion in eight years under George Bush ) by an additional $ 1 trillion -- in roughly his first 100 days in office .
The current economic strategy is right out of " Atlas Shrugged " :
The more incompetent you are in business , the more handouts the politicians will bestow on you .
That 's the justification for the $ 2 trillion of subsidies doled out already to keep afloat distressed insurance companies , banks , Wall Street investment houses , and auto companies
I do n't doubt that the Democratic Congress will be blamed and presented as the all - powerful driver of these bailouts , but , as the article makes clear , Bush and Paulson are going to be dumped into the same " government is bad " bag .
The debate will not be about where the crisis came from ( " crises happen " , in capitalism , it 's a necessary , cleansing process , and do you really want communism back ? ) , it will skim over the fact that the hard right completely controlled all branches of government over the first half the decade , could and did implement its tax - reduction , regulation - dismantling , big business - favoring policies .
It will ignore the fact that Randian bot Alan ' Bubbles ' Greenspan ran monetary policy thoughout and justifies to this day his choice of insanely lax cheap money which is at the heart of the current meltdown .
It will gloss over the fact that the Paulson plan was initiated by ... Paulson , a Bush White House appointee , and rammed through Congress under threat of apocalyptic crisis .
Basically , voluntarily - badly run government leading ( unsurprisingly ) to catastrophe is used as an argument that " government " is evil , rather than the " voluntary badly - run " bit .
Thus , that Republicans ( or Chirac ) cannot or will not run government properly is turned into " all governments are bad " and , given that , of course , Republicans are the party of small government and Democrats of reckless tax - and - spend , the blame firmly rests with the latter - see , they are already running a trillion dollar deficit !
Will the public buy that sleight - of - hand ?
Hopefully not .
But let 's all be ready for that story to be relentlessly pushed by the right , which will suddenly rediscover virtue now that it is no longer in power and blame the cleanup crew for the mess they made .
The gall should no longer surprise us , but it 's still indispensable to point it out for what it is as loudly as we can .

This is a list of facts and anecdotes that have a science - related slant .
They are items of trivia that people all seem to know and share whenever the opportunity arises .
But , at the List Universe we like to get our facts straight – and the items on this list are all dead wrong !
Enjoy our thorough debunking of some of the silliest facts attributed to science .
10 Peenuts
False Fact : A scientific study on peanuts in bars found traces of over 100 unique specimens of urine .
After rigorous searching for more information , it turns out that no scientific study ( or non-scientific study for that matter ) has ever been conducted in to peanuts at bars .
However , there was a study in ice - cubes in UK bars in 2003 which discovered that 44 % of ice cubes tested contained coliform bacteria – bacteria that comes from human poop .
Even more shockingly , 5 % were infected with the potentially deadly E. Coli bacteria .
I guess that proves that they are n’t making their ice cubes from bottled water .
So , next time you are in London , pass on the ice and enjoy some peanuts instead .
9 Elevator Freefall
False Fact : Elevators have killed or can kill when their cable snapped
There is a small element of truth to this “ fact ” – but we will get to that soon .
Firstly , elevators usually have a minimum of four operating cables , as well as an inbuilt braking system and a backup braking system in the shaft which forces a wedge into the shaft to prevent too rapid a drop .
If the cables were all to snap ( and believe me , elevator cables are strong ) , the cars braking system would detect the free fall and automatically apply .
If that also fails , the shaft ’s braking system takes over .
Now , the small element of truth I mentioned earlier is that there has been one recorded account of a complete elevator free fall ; it was caused by an airplane which crashed into the Empire State Building in 1945 .
The crash caused the cables in the elevator to be weakened – ultimately leading to them breaking .
The person riding the lift ( Betty Lou Oliver ) survived the 75 floor free fall because of air pressure beneath the car .
8 Folding Paper
False Fact :
You ca n’t fold a piece of paper in half more than 7 times
This is one we all hear regularly – and we believe it because it is true when we tried it .
But , in 2002 a US high school student Britney Gallivan proved it wrong by folding a piece of thin gold leaf more than 7 times with the use of tweezers .
To further prove that it could be done , she bought a giant roll of toilet paper on the internet and her and her family took it to the local mall where they attempted to fold it more than 7 times .
Seven hours of folding later , they had it folded into 12 folds .
7 Jumping Elephants
False Fact : Elephants are the only mammal that ca n’t jump
First of all , just so you know , it is true that adult elephants ca n’t jump – if by jumping we mean the state of having no feet on the ground at the same time after propelling oneself from a stationary position .
But contrary to the popular myth that it is is the only mammal that can’t , it is joined by a few others .
Firstly , the sloth is unable to jump which suits its lazy lifestyle rather well .
Also , rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses also cannot jump , though unlike elephants , when they run it is possible for them to have all four feet off the ground .
6 Old Dogs
False Fact :
One dog year is equal to seven human years
This bogus fact is usually worked out so that a dog life is equal to a human life in total years , but the numbers just do n’t add up .
The average human life expectancy is 78 , while the average dog life expectancy ( in false dog years ) would equal around 90 years .
Furthermore , different dog breeds have dramatically different life expectancies , ranging from a short 6 years to 13 or more years ( in general , the smaller the dog , the longer its life expectancy ) .
Furthermore , dogs have a very short “ childhood ” and a very long middle - age , making the comparison completely invalid .
5 Offer To Buy
False Fact :
If someone wrongly advertises goods for the wrong price , they have to sell it to you at that price
This is a very popular misconception and I have even seen people arguing about it in a shop .
But the reality is a little more bland .
A shop price is an “ invitation to bargain ” not an “ invitation to buy ” .
This is true in the United States , United Kingdom , Commonwealth nations , and probably the rest of the Western world .
If a shop makes a mistake , they can simply continue to sell the goods at the normal price .
Attempts to defraud by advertising lower prices are caught in other consumer laws .
However , it should be noted that if an electronic transaction is completed you may be eligible to keep the goods if a mistake is made .
4 Space Dust
False Fact : NASA invented the DustBuster
First of all , how do you vacuum in a vacuum ?
You do n’t , so why would NASA need a vacuum cleaner for its space missions ?
It did n’t , but what it did need was a small battery powered drill , so they teemed up with Black and Decker to come up with the perfect device .
Once the device had been realized , Black and Decker were left with great technology from which they eventually developed the DustBuster and other useful home devices .
3 Polar Bears
False Fact : Polar Bears are left handed
Where this myth came from is now lost in the dark recesses of history .
The widespread of this misnomer is quite extraordinary with more google results announcing it as gospel than not .
But in reality , scientists who have spent their working lives studying polar bears have found that they are actually ambidextrous ( they use both hands equally well ) .
It is possible that the myth was started when people observed the bears working well with their left hands , but they neglected to notice that they also worked well with their right .
2 McDonald ’s Wars
False Fact :
No two countries with McDonald ’s franchises have ever gone to war .
This theory was proposed by Thomas Friedman and became massively popular all around the world .
It was used to show that countries loving democracy ( those most likely to have a McDonald ’s franchise ) have lived peacefully together due to the merits of that political system ( this is also called the Democratic Peace Theory and the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Resolution ) .
Friedman proposed it in his book The Lexus and the Olive Tree .
So , is it true ?
No. Georgia and Russia were recently at war with each other and both have McDonald’s .
Furthermore , Israel and Lebanon also defy the theory for their conflict in 2006 , and right after the book was published , NATO bombed Serbia – again disproving the idea .
1 The Great Wall
False Fact : The Great Wall of China is the only manmade structure visible from space .
Well this is wrong on many levels .
Firstly , while you are still close enough to earth to actually see the great wall , you can also see road networks , and other large objects created by man .
There is , in fact , no distance from earth in which you can only see the great wall .
By the time you get a few thousand miles away , you can see nothing manmade .
Astronaut Alan Bean said :
“ The only thing you can see from the moon is a beautiful sphere , mostly white ( clouds ) , some blue ( ocean ) , patches of yellow ( deserts ) , and every once in a while some green vegetation .
No man -made object is visible on this scale .
In fact , when first leaving earth ’s orbit and only a few thousand miles away , no man -made object is visible at that point either . ”

Patrick Thomson has written a wonderful description of why jQuery is a monad including a discussion of cautious computation and state transformations .
No need to know monads or jQuery ( although an interest in one will help you appreciate the other ) .
As Patrick explains nicely , jQuery is monadic in that is meets all three requirements of a monad .
A monad is a concept from category theory .
A type is a monad if it meets three requirements
Monads wrap themselves around other data types Monads have an operator that performs this wrapping Monads can feed the wrapped value to a function as long as that function also returns a monad
Anyone familiar with jQuery will immediately recognize that this is a good , abstract description of jQuery 's operation .
The beauty of this , from jQuery 's perspective is a nice programming style called " chaining " where wrapped chunks of the DOM are passed from operator to operator in pipeline fashion .
Using this style effectively results in compact , yet readable code with little need for intermediate variables .
You may find it ironic to think of DOM manipulation happening in a functional style , but that 's just what jQuery allows .
So , if you 're a jQuery programmer you may be moving more and more toward a functional style of programming without even knowing it .
Resembling comets streaking across the sky , these four speedy stars are plowing through dense interstellar gas , creating brilliant arrowhead structures called bow shocks .
LONG BEACH , Calif . ?
A total of 14 young stars racing through clouds of gas like bullets , creating brilliant arrowhead structures and tails of glowing gas , have beenrevealed by NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope .
They represent a new type of runawaystars , scientists say .
Thediscovery of the speedy stars by Hubble , announced here today at the 213th meeting of the American Astronomical Society , came as something of a shock to the astronomers who found them .
" Wethink we have found a new class of bright , high - velocity stellarinterlopers , " said study leader Raghvendra Sahai of NASA 's Jet PropulsionLaboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" Finding these stars is a complete surprisebecause we were not looking for them .
When I first saw the images , I said ' Wow .
This is like a bullet speeding through the interstellar medium . ' "
Thearrowhead structures , or bow shocks , seen in front of the stars are formed when the stars ' powerful stellar winds ( streams of neutral or charged gas that flow from the stars ) slam into thesurrounding dense gas , like a speeding boat pushing through water on a lake .
Youthfulstars
The strong stellarwinds suggest that the stars are young , just a few million years old , theteam concluded .
Most stars produce powerful winds either when they are veryyoung or very old ; and only very massive stars ( with masses greater than 10 times that of the sun ) can keep generating these winds throughout theirlifetimes .
But theobjects Sahai and his team found are n't very massive , because they do n't haveglowing clouds of ionized gas around them .
They appear to be medium - sized starsup to eight times more massive than the sun .
The stars ' youth is also evidenced by the fact that the shapes of nebulas around dyingstars are very different from what is seen around the stars found by Hubble , and old stars are almost never found near dense interstellar clouds , as thesestars are .
Runaways
The bowshocks that the stars created in those interstellar clouds could be anywherefrom 100 billion to a trillion miles wide ( the equivalent of 17 times to 170 timesthe width of our solar system , out to the orbit of Neptune ) .
These bowshocks indicate that the stars are traveling fast , more than 112,000 mph( 180,000 kph ) with respect to the dense gas they ?re plowing through ?
roughlyfive times faster than typical young stars .
Sahai andhis team think the young stars are runaways that were jettisoned from the clustersthey were born in .
" Thehigh - speed stars were likely kicked out of their homes , which were probablymassive star clusters , " Sahai said .
There aretwo possible scenarios for how this stellar expulsion could have happened : Oneway is if one star in a binary system exploded as a supernova and the partnergot kicked out .
Another is a collision between two binary star systems or abinary system and a third star .
One or more of these stars could have picked upenergy from the interaction and escaped the cluster .
Assumingthe youthful phase of the stars lasts only for a million years and that thestars are traveling at 112,000 mph , they have traveled about 160 light - years , Sahai said .
Tip ofthe iceberg
The starsspotted by Sahai and his team are n't the first stellar runaways astronomershave found .
The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) spied a fewsimilar - looking objects in the late 1980s .
But thosestars produced much larger bow shocks that the stars found by Hubble , suggesting they are more massive stars with ?
more powerful stellar winds .
" Thestars in our study are likely the lower - mass and / or lower - speed counterparts tothe massive stars with bow shocks detected by IRAS , " Sahai said .
" Wethink the massive runaway stars observed before were just the tip of theiceberg .
The stars seen with Hubble may represent the bulk of the population , both because many more lower - mass stars inhabit the universe than higher - massstars , and because a much larger number are subject to modest speedkicks . "
Theserenegade stars are n't easy to find though because " you do n't know where tolook for them because you cannot predict where they will be , " Sahaiexplained .
" So all of them have been found serendipitously , including the 14 stars we found with Hubble . "
Sahai andhis team were actually looking for pre-planetary nebulas , the puffed - up agingstars on the verge of shedding most of their layers to become glowing planetarynebulas .
Theastronomers are planning follow - up studies to search for more interlopers , aswell as study what effect they have on the gas surround them .
" Oneof the questions that these very showy encounters raise is what effect theyhave on the clouds , " said study team member Mark Morris of the University of California , Los Angeles .
" Is it an insignificant flash in the pan , or do thestrong winds from these stars stir up the clouds and thereby slow down theirevolution toward forming another generation of stars ? "
The U.S. Army is funding improvements to a drunk driving game developed at the University of Calgary , in hopes of reducing what they say is a growing drunk driving problem among soldiers returning from war zones .

Booze Cruise allows users to enter their weight and a number of drinks , then attempt to drive home using keyboard keys on their computer driving games .
Reaction times are delayed and screen vision blurred , while they drive trying to avoid pedestrians , vehicles and other obstacles .
" What we 're trying to show them is it 's not possible to think yourself sober .
Some people believe that if you just focus , you can drive really well , " said Jim Parker , the University of Calgary professor of both computer science and fine arts who led the development of the game .

The game , which the army will start using in the next month or so , was initially developed in 2007 , but the army provided funds to improve it .

Despite the Army 's interest , Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada ( how do you drive a country sober or drunk ? ) decry the game , saying it will just teach people how to better drive while impaired .
" We 've spent decades telling people not to drink and drive , and this simulator , one of the skills it teaches is to drink so much , and then drive , " said Andrew Murie , chief executive officer of MADD Canada .

Jell - O wrestling is n't all that unusual .
A staple of biker bars and fraternity parties everywhere , it typically involves wiggling , jiggling and giggling .
But at the bottom of the world , on the McMurdo ice station , Jell - O wrestling recently became a firing offense — at least for one employee of Centennial - based Raytheon Polar Services Company , which holds the ten - year contract to staff the United States Antarctic Program .
Last week , the unnamed man was dismissed after employees of the U.S. Inspector General 's office , conducting an audit of Antarctica 's McMurdo Station , discovered the aftermath of a Jell - O wrestling party .
According to news reports , the employee defended himself , saying " No one was injured ... no equipment was abused or damaged , no one complained to HR , there was no inappropriate behavior , clothing or nudity . "
Raytheon Polar Services spokeswoman Valerie Carroll would n't confirm the details but said the incident was only " part of the reason " the employee lost his job .

The story is just one of a series of odd tales to float up from Antarctica over the years : many involve binge drinking in what is a very isolated place , especially during the long , dark months of March through October , when only about 150 - 200 people live at McMurdo .
And last June , a story hit the wires about a shipment of 16,500 condoms that was delivered to McMurdo just before the dark winter began .
" All kinds of people work there .
All kinds of activities take place .
There are lots of traditions , lots of fun things , " Carroll says .
Many of them are unusual , but she wishes the scandalous ones had n't overshadowed some of the others .
For instance , there 's an art festival , a music festival ( called IceStock ) , and the " Race Around the World , " in which people run around the South Pole ( every way you look is north ) .
There 's also a big bash every Halloween at which people dress in costumes they 've brought along .
But the Jell - O story comes at an awkward time for Raytheon , which has about 400 employees working in the Denver area and trains many of the 1,200 people to head to the South Pole here , since the deadline to re-bid on the Antarctica program is this month .
The National Science Foundation , which funds the $ 1.6 billion program , will make a decision this year sometime and then award the next ten - year contract .
Probably not in the budget : Jell - O .
No food - stamp soup for you !
And speaking of low - budget food items , Ari Armstrong , founder of www.freecolorado.com and columnist for the Grand Junction Free Press , can tell you all about them .
Armstrong likes nothing better than to fire up his libertarian indignation against the meddling of big government , abuses of personal liberty and the suppression of free - market ideals .
And with Barack Obama 's multibillion - dollar stimulus plan grabbing headlines , he should have lots to fume about .
So what 's the latest target of his cerebral ire ?
Food stamps .
That 's right : food stamps , those little things that help struggling families eat .
Sick of complaints that people on food stamps can only afford unhealthy meals — and sick of the federal food - stamp program in general — Armstrong spent a week chowing down on $ 4.72 of groceries per day and says he 's hardly ever eaten better .
Reporter Joel Warner grabbed lunch with Armstrong during the experiment to talk the politics of food .
And since Armstrong did n't have enough to share , Warner brought his own meal — a nice , expensive , freshly baked loaf of bread , the food Armstrong said he missed the most .

No one could have predicted this would happen .
John Yoo and John Bolton , in the NY Times , discuss the need to limit executive authority .
Up next , David Addington and Dick Cheney write in the Washington Post on the need to reject Unitary Executive theory .
I knew these wankers would do this , I just did n’t expect it immediately and so brazenly .

Advertisement The MoD has lifted the lid on its Defence Technology Plan , the latest gadgets and gizmos it hopes could help equip the troops in the future .
Cameras that can see through dust and unmanned ground vehicles were among the devices on show .
It is the first time the MoD has unveiled its long - term research needs and demonstrated new technology .
The products are still in their early stages , although it is hoped many will go into service in the next few years .
The MoD hopes to attract more future technology to address its combat needs .
MoD 's technology goals Reducing the load a soldier has to carry from the current 75 kg to 25kg while improving personal protection levels Creating a new breed of fighting vehicles - the future protected vehicles - in which the MoD wants the capability of a main battle tank but in an all - terrain vehicle weighing less than 30 tonnes Reducing the armed forces ' dependency on fossil fuels Developing the next generation of unmanned air vehicles ( UAV ) Understanding and defending the threats posed by cyber - warfare Speaking at the launch , the Minister for Defence Equipment and Support , Quentin Davies , said technology was key to staying one step ahead of the enemy .
" It is more vital than ever before that we exploit new and emerging technologies because the threats our troops face are always evolving , " he said .
The products unveiled were the first in a number of submissions chosen by the MoD for further development .
D3O
This is a long chain silicon polymer that looks and feels like silly putty .
The material can be shaped and squeezed , but a shock impact will cause it to lock together .
The idea is to use the material as body armour to protect troops from shock impacts .
It will not stop bullets , but used in conjunction with projectile - protection systems , it can help disperse the energy from a bullet .
It is being tested for use within helmets and might become a feature of Peaock , an MoD body armour currently in development .
SATURN Saturn - the sensing and automotive tactical urban reconnaissance network - is a combination of UAV and unmanned ground vehicle ( UGV ) that not only examines the battlefield but , say the developers , can actively spot threats .
The idea is that a platoon or company of soldiers would deploy both the ground and air vehicle to perform reconnaissance of a village or part of a town .
The UAV would fly over and spot vehicles or enemy troops moving in the open , while the UGV would roll up to a building , spot which windows are open , then look to see if anyone was behind them .
The developers say the system would then try and differentiate between civilians and possible enemy contacts by looking to see if they were holding an object , such as a rifle or a rocket - propelled grenade .
PIBBD
The developers are calling it a mobile lab in a suitcase , which is only slightly shorter than its full title of portable integrated battlespace biological detection unit .
The purpose of the device is simple - to analyse the air and sound a warning if there is any form of biological threat .
The device works by continuously sampling the air , then mixing it with a liquid and passing it across plates with embedded antibodies .
Should the air contain a biological hazard , the antibodies become active , changing the electrical properties of the plate and triggering an alarm .
At present , most mobile detection units are the site of a large van so something that could be carried by a soldier would be a real advantage .
TESTUDO Another UGV , this is a robot scout designed to examine hostile areas from a safe distance .
The device , not much larger than a skateboard , has the capability to cover almost all types of terrain and can even climb stairs .
The developers hope the finished product would cost less than £ 5,000 and be small enough to be easily carried by a soldier .
TELEDYNE
One of the problems flying helicopters in Afghanistan and Iraq is dust .
The down - draught from the rotor blades can kick up huge clouds , blinding the pilots and making landing very hazardous .
Teledyne is a device that uses microwaves to see through dust clouds , smoke and snow , making landings far easier .
The developers plan to put Teledyne through full trials later this year .

[ We ] Kept Us Safe
On this last weekend of George W Bush 's administration — after a week of hearing the man and his surrogates bleat that he kept us safe — I rewatched United 93 .
This was only my second time through the film .
It 's not an easy one .
On September 11th , one of my friends and co-workers in Baltimore , lost both her parents on American Airlines flight 77 .
Shortly after that , one of my classmates from our very small middle school , trapped , was killed on one of the top floors of the WTC towers .
Whether you 're reading the 9/11 Commission report 's account , or watching this remarkable film , the best contrast for our era plays out for you .
In the film , the air traffic controllers , the military officers , the professionals in the film , are generally played by the actual people in those roles on that day .
They do their jobs , and do them well — piecing together the horrifying truth from the snippets available to them with startiling skill and deftness .
They know what to do , the best next step ; they are prevented from doing it .
So much power , just a vast amount of power , is concentrated into the hands of the incompetent few — the unitary executive , the vortex of incompetence , the duet of Bush and Cheney .
The orders to activate the military force against the hijacked jets never came .
The order to ground all flights never came .
In the latter case , the decision was simply made .
Bush and Cheney were too busy in their cowardice to do their duty .
These men and women did .
As thanks , for the duration of this administration , civil servants were deeply , profoundly and criminally disrespected by these petty fools .
And then , it came down to that more - or - less random collection of forty of your fellow citizens .
They made the decision that Bush and Cheney refused to make .
They brought their own jet down , based on gleaned details of what was happening .
They were rational , cool and successful in all the ways that Bush was incoherent , panicky and incompetent .
If you want to give credit to anyone for the lack of further attacks , for no more airliners being hijacked , thank these passengers , who demonstrated that Americans are made of sterner stuff than Al - Queda or Bush would like you to believe .
We did n't need to be kept safe .
We kept ourselves safe .
We 'll keep ourselves safe .
It 's our republic .
It 's our bravery and freedom , not yours to claim , President Bush .
VWM : About Viper Window Manager ( VWM ) is a lightweight , extensible window manager for the console .
Originally , VWM was designed to be the reference implementation of libviper .
In fact , the two projects were initially one before public release .
From conception , VWM was designed to be both lightweight and ssh friendly .
Character based line - art compresses very well as do the escape sequences which handle cursor manipulation .
This makes VWM quite suitable for low - bandwidth , remote connectivity over ssh .
It is also very easy to extend the functionality of VWM .
By following a few simple API rules , anyone can create a “ native application ” which will appear on the VWM Main Menu .
The mechanism for this is very similar to Mozilla - style plugins .
VWM : About :
Mouse VWM was designed to be completely functional with only the keyboard .
However , optional support is provided for those systems running GPM ( sorry no sysmouse support yet ) .
VWM : About : Plugins VWM comes with two plugins and a built - in screensaver .
Although VWM is not a multi - threaded application , it mimics the feel by using a tightly throttled callback queue and inter-process messaging ( provided by libpseudo ) .
VWM : About : Plugins : Sysmon Sysmon is a tool for monitoring basic system resources such as CPU usage and memory usage .
It uses libgtop2 for detecting resources and is optional for installation .
VWM : About : Plugins : Ptyterm Ptyterm is a terminal emulator which allows you to run all of those great command line tools .
As with all plugins , this too is optional for install , but you will almost always want to install it .
So you 're a football fan who 's desperate to get your hands on some Super Bowl tickets .
You can't afford to buy any without selling your car and two major organs , and you have absolutely no other useful possessions , or even skills , to offer the world .
What do you do ?
You post a sad , desperate plea on the Internet .
Maybe it'll work , maybe it wo n't .
But either way , Cracked will make fun of you .

6 Woman Sells Ad Space on Pregnant Stomach Continue Reading Below Advertisement
There are some fantastic wives in this world , and then there is Jennifer Gordon .
At eight months pregnant , a time when many women would be raining down hellfire on their husbands for even daring to watch football , she hatched a foolproof plan to get her and her man to Super Bowl XLI in person .
Hell .
Yes .
All she had to do was go on the Internet and offer to paint any message on her pregnant belly in exchange for Super Bowl tickets .
Wait , did we say the plan was foolproof ?
We think that was the wrong word .
Naturally , being that this is the Internet , the offers poured in .
Would she get off merely having to paint her belly to look like the Death Star ?
Or some 4 chan meme , such as a dude in an afro saying , " VAGINA'S CLOSED " ?
Or , would she find herself at the 50 - yard line with " THE DADDY COULD BE ANY OF SIX NAMELESS HOBOS " stamped in giant letters on her abdomen ?

After sifting through over 200 offers , many of which were described as " wacky " or " X - rated " ( who could have predicted that ? ) , she got off with merely having to advertise a Chicago - based company called UBid.com ( auctions ?
On the Internet ?
Why did n't anyone else think of that ?! ) .
e Bay already shotgunned the fetus .
UBid.com lamely just had her put the logo on her belly , passing up countless opportunities for meta humor , ie , " BID FOR MY VIRGINITY AT UBID.COM ! "
You got off easy this time , Jennifer Gordon .

Koushik Dutta has posted two great updates on his blog about Mono running on the Android powered G1 phone .
The code necessary to build Mono on Android is available at the androidmono page .
The first bit is his work to allow Mono code to call Dalvik code as well as the bridge to allow Dalvik / Java to call into .NET code .
This is necessary to allow Mono - based applications to call into the phone API and integrate with the existing stack .
The second bit is a cute show of DLR - based IronPython running on the phone .
This of course means that with the bridge in place , any CLR or DLR - based language can access the functionality exposed in Dalvik .
Claim : A bill before Congress would prohibit ownership of handguns by those who have not obtained firearm licenses .
OUTDATED
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , February 2009 ]
It has started .
It has started .
Very Important for you to be aware of a new bill HR 45 introduced into the House .
This is the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sale Act of 2009 .
We just learned yesterday about this on the Peter Boyles radio program .
Even gun shop owners did n’t know about this because it is flying under the radar .
To find out about this – go to any government website and type in HR 45 or Google HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing & Record of Sales Act of 2009 .
You will get all the information .
Basically this would make it illegal to own a firearm – any rifle with a clip or ANY pistol unless :
It is registered You are fingerprinted You supply a current Driver ’s License You supply your Social Security #
You will submit to a physical & mental evaluation at any time of their choosing Each update – change or ownership through private or public sale must be reported and costs $ 25 – Failure to do so you automatically lose the right to own a firearm and are subject up to a year in jail .
There is a child provision clause on page 16 section 305 stating a child - access provision .
Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18 .
They would have the right to come and inspect that you are storing your gun safely away from accessibility to children and fine is punishable for up to 5 yrs . in prison .
If you think this is a joke – go to the website and take your pick of many options to read this .
It is long and lengthy .
But , more and more people are becoming aware of this .
Pass the word along .
Any hunters in your family – pass this along .
Peter Boyles is on this and having guests .
Listen to him on KHOW 630 a.m. in the morning .
He suggests the best way to fight this is to tell all your friends about it and “ spring into action ” .
Also he suggests we all join a pro-gun group like the Colorado Rifle Association , hunting associations , gun clubs and especially the NRA .
This is just a “ termite ” approach to complete confiscation of guns and disarming of our society to the point we have no defense – chip away a little here and there until the goal is accomplished before anyone realizes it .
This is one to act on whether you own a gun or not .
If you take my gun , only the criminal will have one to use against me .
HR 45 only makes me / us less safe .
After working with convicts for 26 years I know this bill , if passed , would make them happy and in less danger from their victims .
Variations :
An August 2009 version of the Blair Holt e-mail combined it with a Handgun Safety and Registration Act ( SB2099 ) e-mail that falsely claims a bill before Congress would require all handgun owners to list their firearms on their federal income tax returns .
These are two distinctly different bills .
Origins : On 10 May 2007 , 16 - year - old Chicago honor student Blair Holt was riding a bus home from school when another teenager began firing a handgun in a gang - related attack .
When Holt moved to shield a girl on the bus from the spray of bullets , he was himself hit in the abdomen and died .
At Blair Holt ’s funeral , Rep. Bobby Rush of Illinois ( representing the state ’s First Congressional district ) promised to honor Holt ’s memory by introducing a strong gun tracking bill in Congress .
One month later , Rep. Rush introduced Blair Holt ’s Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act to Congress , but it was referred to a subcommittee and languished there without ever having been voted upon .
On 6 January 2009 , Rush introduced essentially the same bill to Congress again as Blair Holt ’s Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 ( H.R. 45 ) .
In a nutshell , the Blair Holt bill would :
Prohibit possession of any handguns or any semiautomatic firearms that can accept detachable ammunition - feeding devices ( excluding antiques ) by anyone who has not been issued a firearm license .
Require all sales of those types of firearms to go through licensed dealers .
Direct the Attorney General to establish and run a federal record - of - sale system .
Require the possessors of firearms to secure them ( by secure gun storage or safety devices ) when they are kept in locales where children might be capable of gaining access to those firearms .
In order to be issued a firearm license under the provisions of the Blair Holt legislation , applicants would be required to submit the following information to the Attorney General :
a current , passport - sized photograph of the applicant that provides a clear , accurate likeness of the applicant the name , address , and date and place of birth of the applicant any other name that the applicant has ever used or by which the applicant has ever been known a clear thumb print of the applicant , which shall be made when , and in the presence of the entity to whom , the application is submitted with respect to each category of person prohibited by Federal law , or by the law of the State of residence of the applicant , from obtaining a firearm , a statement that the individual is not a person prohibited from obtaining a firearm a certification by the applicant that the applicant will keep any firearm owned by the applicant safely stored and out of the possession of persons who have not attained 18 years of age a certificate attesting to the completion at the time of application of a written firearms examination , which shall test the knowledge and ability of the applicant regarding :
the safe storage of firearms , particularly in the vicinity of persons who have not attained 18 years of age
of age the safe handling of firearms
the use of firearms in the home and the risks associated with such use
the legal responsibilities of firearms owners , including Federal , State , and local laws relating to requirements for the possession and storage of firearms , and relating to reporting requirements with respect to firearms
any other subjects , as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate
an authorization by the applicant to release to the Attorney General or an authorized representative of the Attorney General any mental health records pertaining to the applicant the date on which the application was submitted the signature of the applicant
( Contrary to the example e-mail quoted above , the bill would not require applicants to “ submit to a physical and mental evaluation at any time of their choosing ” ; applicants would have to authorize the release of any existing mental health records .
Also , the right of inspection to ascertain compliance with the law would apply
to “ any place in which firearms or firearm products are manufactured , stored , or held , for distribution in commerce , ” not to ordinary households . )
Proponents of the Blair Holt bill maintain that it is not an attempt to ban or otherwise infringe on the constitutional right to own or carry guns ; it would simply establish a system for registering and tracking the ownership of guns that are used illegally , similar to the system currently used for automobiles .
Opponents of the bill maintain that it “ focuses on the instruments of crime rather than on the criminals who use the instruments , ” and that , rather than targeting the criminal element , it “ would simply further burden law - abiding people . ”
As was the 2007 version of Blair Holt ’s Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act , the 2009 version was referred to the House Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism , and Homeland Security , and it died there without being voted upon .
The fact that the bill did not have even a single co-sponsor made it unlikely that it would ever have beeen brought to a vote before Congress , much less passed .
ESPN Outdoors correspondent Wade Bourne summed up the bill ’s chances of passage thusly :
So , how likely is the Blair Holt bill ’s chance for passage ?
Pro-gun activists are vigilant but do n’t seem overly worried about it .
They point out that the bill ’s failure to attract co-sponsors is an indication of a lack of enthusiasm for it among other congressmen .
They feel it is too far - reaching and repressive of gun owners ’ rights to merit serious consideration by a majority of Congress .

Lawrence Keane of the NSSF [ National Shooting Sports Foundation ] states , “ If this bill passes , Democrats would likely lose ( control of ) their chamber in upcoming mid-term elections ( 2010 ) .
The leadership in the House knows that . ”
Keane says some 80 million - plus U.S. citizens own firearms , representing nearly half the households in the nation .
He believes that House Democrats will allow the Blair Holt bill to die in subcommittee rather than risk the ire of so many pro-gun voters .

Just got back from CUSEC .
I got an interesting view of the current state of the programmer subculture .
It is much more social than in my day .
There is a whole culture of meetups , *- camps , and little conferences .
Ruby seems particularly cool right now .
Almost everyone had a Mac .
Doing open source counts a lot for street cred .
What I found shocking was that there are now “ cool programmers ” , who are cool not because of awesome code , but by virtue of showmanship and relentless self - promotion .
It ’s like the cool kids in High School .
Blogging and twittering has become a way to strike a pose and market yourself .
Group events have become parties for working your popularity , and some of them have become semi-exclusive .
To take a positive view , this just shows that programming has become a normal human activity , and programmers are reverting to the mean of human behavior .
Still 98 % male though .
I wonder if there is some connection to the fact that social networking apps are all the rage right now .
Web 2.0 yada yada .
I find it a little depressing that the ultimate fruit of our technology should be to give people new ways to gossip and flirt .
I got to meet Dan Ingalls and Avi Bryant .
Had a good conversation with Avi .
Just from talking with him , I could tell he is a great programmer , probably better than I am , even than I was at his age .
Scary .
Anyway , we talked about Smalltalk a lot .
It suddenly clicked that a lot of the people who appreciate my work are Smalltalkers .
Much of my work could be seen as trying to pick up where Smalltalk left off .
There would be a certain poetic justice in my using Smalltalk as a development platform – stepping back in history in order to move forward .
Every once in a while I check out the latest state of Squeak , but get put off by the terrible out - of - the box experience .
I mean , bit - mapped fonts !
The popup help refers to the red and blue mouse buttons ( from the Alto ) .
You can almost hear disco music in the background .
These cosmetics are a good example of why Smalltalk has had a seminal influence on programming , but no one actually uses it .
The Smalltalk culture just does n’t reach out .
They are more like a cult in a mountaintop monastery .
If you can prove yourself by overcoming the difficult path to reach them , they will teach their secret knowledge to you .
But they are not about to make it attractive and easy for everyone .
This attitude is even reflected in the core technology , which has difficulty packaging and distributing applications to users .
Smalltalk is for programming , and teaching , but not for vulgar commerce .
A great tragedy , in my opinion .
As for my talk , I guess it went OK , and a number of people talked with me afterwards , but I was dissatisfied with it .
I tried to cram in both my research and reflections on the field , and there really was n’t enough time for both and I ended up rushed and skipping .

Since the breakup of the Soviet Union and the beginnings of democratization in the fragments , Russians and Americans have talked with considerable openness , indeed warmth .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has appealed to the United States for assistance and once announced that he wanted to replace the Russian legislature with a body similar to the American Congress .
This coming together should come as no surprise , a Russian diplomat said , since the first Americans , after all , were Russian immigrants .
Well .
That is stretching the historical record a bit , though the ancestors of today 's Native Americans probably did cross the Bering Sea from Siberia to Alaska on ice or a land bridge .
Course , there was no Russia then , or United States , or England , or any other nation state , but it makes a good post - cold war conversation opener .
California 's modern Russian connection is not so tenuous .
Tsar Paul I in 1799 granted a monopolistic charter for the Alaskan fur trade to the Russian - American Fur Company .
Russians had been taking furs in Alaska since the mid-eighteenth century and established a permanent settlement on Kodiak Island in 1784 .
The Russians had nothing but problems .
Excessive hunting led to the virtual disappearance of the sea otter and other fur- bearing animals .
The Aleut Indians , whom the Russians had brought from the Aleutian Islands for their hunting skills , were willing confederates , but other Native Americans , notably the Tlingits , were hostile .
The most pressing problem for the Russians , however , was that they could not grow enough food to feed themselves .
Farms and herds were established farther south at today 's Sitka in 1804 , but they were no more successful there .
The soil was poor , the climate cold and the growing season too short .
Trade with American ships -- furs for food -- helped , but it was not the answer .
A company official therefore was dispatched in 1806 to Spain 's northern province of California .
His immediate mission was to try to buy supplies , but he was also to investigate prospects for the fur trade .
Spanish authorities were not happy to receive Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov .
Spain 's hold on its frontier province was fragile , and it did not wish to assist another power that might threaten its claim .
Besides , trade with the Russians was illegal .
Rezanov knew that he must succeed , or the colony at Sitka might starve .
In the midst of the negotiations , which seemed doomed to failure , the count announced that he had fallen in love with Do ñ a Concepci ón Arg ü ello .
It was no coincidence that she was the daughter of the commandant of the San Francisco presidio .
The fifteen - year - old Do ñ a Concepci ón , swept off her feet by the gallant count , who was thirty - five years her senior , pled his cause .
The authorities of church and state , including her father , were won over , and Rezanov was furnished the goods he needed .
But the marriage had to wait .
Do ñ a Concepci ón , a Roman Catholic , must secure permission from Rome , and , for Rezanov 's part , the tsar and the Eastern Orthodox authorities at St. Petersburg must consent to the marriage .
Rezanov sailed for Sitka with his cargo of supplies , vowing to return to his betrothed as soon as possible .
Alas , he was never seen again in California .
Rezanov died tragically en route to Russia .
Do ñ a Concepci ón learned of his death only after years of waiting .
She never married .
Writers have made much of the star - crossed romance .
In many accounts , Do ñ a Concepci ón grieves her lost love ; her life thereafter is desperate and empty .
The evidence suggests a more commonplace affair .
Rezanov might have intended to honor his vows , but his proposal probably was more a matter of expedience than love .
Far from wasting away in later life , Do ñ a Concepci ón , according to one historian , " became a stout and rather jolly woman who found much pleasure in acts of kindness and charity . "
Giving up any hope of feeding themselves from their Alaskan farms , a force of twenty - five Russians and eighty Aleuts under the command of Ivan Kuskov in 1812 established a fortified settlement on the California coast north of Bodega Bay .
Fort Ross would grow food for the Alaska settlements and conduct sea otter hunts along the California coast .
It would also serve as a base for trade with the Californians .
Spanish officials protested this intrusion , but the Russians knew that the Spaniards did not have the military capability to dislodge them .
They knew also that the Californians were starved for trade since Mexico and Spain were being ravaged in the early years of the nineteenth century by war and revolutionary upheavals .
Californians might protest the Russian presence and condemn the illicit trade , but they would blink and trade nevertheless .
Fort Ross seemed promising .
Scores of Aleut hunters in their kayaks took furs on the coast and in San Francisco Bay .
Hundreds of local Indians were employed to lay out and work extensive farms and to tend herds of cattle and sheep .
An incredible variety of goods , from household utensils and farm implements to furniture and clothing , were manufactured in the fort 's shops and traded with Californians .
The fort was visited by a number of notable scientists and explorers who studied the region and reported their findings
The promise soon faded .
The northern California coast is known today for its fog during the growing season .
The fort 's wheat succumbed to rust , and its vegetables did not thrive in the moist air .
The fort was built on a gently sloping bench that ended in a high bluff overlooking the sea ; its port at Bodega Bay was eighteen miles away .
The California authorities , still worried about the Russians , prevented their expansion by building missions at San Rafael and Sonoma and granting huge tracts of land east of the fort to Mexican citizens .
By the late 1830s , Russian - American Fur Company officials considered the future .
Fort Ross had not proved the agricultural bonanza that its founders had predicted .
The company indeed was forced to contract with the British Hudson 's Bay Company to supply its Alaskan settlements .
The sea otter had virtually disappeared from California coasts by the mid-1830s due to excessive hunting .
Furthermore , company officials by the early 1840s were convinced that the westward - moving Americans eventually would overrun California .
Putting all this together , the company in 1841 sold the fort and its contents to John A. Sutter , the enterprising Swiss - Mexican who had built his own agricultural empire around New Helvetia , today 's Sacramento .
The Russians withdrew to Alaska and never returned .
The fort remained and can be visited today .
Built of local redwood , the fort has been faithfully preserved and restored .
The twin - domed chapel , built in the mid-1820s , was the first Russian Orthodox church in North America outside Alaska .
Russian - Americans still meet in ceremony annually at the church .
Other company buildings line the perimeter of the compound , all surrounded by a stockade with two blockhouses that were supplied with cannon and muskets .
The region still echoes with reminders of the Russian presence .
About six miles south of Fort Ross , the three branches of Russian Gulch join near the coast .
Six miles farther , the Russian River reaches the sea .
Moscow Road borders the river .
The town of Sebastopol is about fifteen miles inland from Bodega Bay .
The " Stewards of Slavianka , " a volunteer organization , provides services to visitors in the state parks of the Russian River area .
The most striking " Russian " structure in the region was built in 1972 .
On the coast north of Fort Ross , the architecture of St. Orres , a bed and breakfast inn , was inspired by Russian nineteenth - century country style .
Two turrets , topped by onion - shaped , copper - plated domes , frame the building .
The smaller of the two houses a spiral staircase while the larger serves as a pretty dining room with a soaring ceiling of glass and magnificent old redwood beams .
Breakfast there is a delight to all the senses .
In fact , hundred - year - old timbers that were salvaged from an old mill were used throughout the structure by Hugo Black , the builder .
The unpainted wood on the front of the inn gleams like burnished gold in the late evening sun .
The sight would warm the heart of even a discouraged Fort Ross official .
To reach California 's " Russian Region , " drive north from the San Francisco Bay area on Highwa y 101 .
Nine miles north of Petaluma , turn west on Highway 116 , and drive through Sebastopol and alongside the Russian River .
At the coast , turn north about twelve miles to reach Fort Ross , now a unit in the California State Park System .
The coast is popular with visitors , and accommodation is not hard to find .
St. Orres is just beyond Gualala , which is twenty - eight miles north of Fort Ross on Highway 1 .

Marine commandant wants his troops out of Iraq
Iraq is stable enough to allow the roughly 22,000 U.S. Marines there to withdraw , the service 's top general said Friday .
" The time is right for Marines in general terms to leave Iraq , " said Marine Corps Commandant James Conway .
That war has become largely a nation - building mission rather than the pitched fighting in which the Marine Corps excels , Conway said .
Conway said he wants to see up to 20,000 Marines deployed instead to the building fight in Afghanistan , especially in the south where insurgents and the Taliban and al - Qaida benefit from both a nearby safe haven and booming trade in narcotics .
" When you 've got those two elements you 've got the potential for a long - term insurgency , " he said .
" That 's where the Marines ought to be .
That 's what we offer the nation , " he said .
The Marine Corps can't fight in both Iraq and Afghanistan , he said , because it does not have enough combat support troops and equipment to divide between the missions .
" Anything that you put into Afghanistan must necessarily come as a reduction of Marine forces in Iraq , " he told reporters .
" When the door slams on the Marines in Iraq , let all the Marines be on the other side of the door . "
Conway has been pushing for a large deployment of Marines to Afghanistan for months .
No decisions have been made on the size of the force that would be sent .
President Barack Obama is expected to go to the Pentagon next week to meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff_ the military heads of each service_ in their secure meeting room known as " the tank . "
Sorting out troop levels in Afghanistan and Iraq is expected to be on the agenda .
Conway said that Obama 's willingness to meet with his military chiefs at the Pentagon instead of the White House amounts to a gesture of respect to the commanders .
" It is great symbology ; he 's on our turf , " he said .
" More importantly , he gets to meet and shake hands with hundreds of people in all the services . "

Programming in Scala Leaps onto the World Stage !
by Bill Venners
December 18 , 2008
Summary
Artima 's first published book , Programming in Scala , made its bookstore debut last week at the Devoxx conference in Antwerp , Belgium , where it sold out .
Twice .

It 's been a long two years , filled with much toil and struggle , but at last we can hold the physical book in our hands .
The paper book arrived on the west coast the day before Thanksgiving , and we captured in a photo the moment I pulled the first one out of a carton :
What a long journey to get to that moment .
It all started two years ago in December 2006 , when I emailed Martin Odersky , the designer of a then relatively unknown language named Scala , to set up a phone call .
Frank Sommers and I had noticed a trend in our editorial work at Artima : functional programming seemed to be becoming more acceptable in mainstream programming circles .
I had the idea that perhaps Artima could provide some leadership by helping people learn functional programming ideas .
Or put another way , perhaps we could provide leadership by getting out in front and helping people get where they seemed to already want to go .
Our initial thought was that perhaps we could publish some articles on functional programming concepts using Scala for the examples , and this is what Frank and I asked Martin about on the call .
Martin said he thought that would be a good idea , and added that he also wanted to try and create a book on Scala .
I replied that we had been wanting to enter the arena of book publishing , to expand our web publishing activities to publishing with actual ink on real paper .
It seemed like a good fit , so after further discussions we decided to embark on a Scala book project together .
At first Martin Odersky and Lex Spoon were the sole authors of the book , and I was the editor .
But as we got deeper into the project it became apparent that it would help to have one more author , and so we added my name to the list and I started writing .
All three of us poured enormous amounts of time into the project in the ensuing 18 months or so .
Given that Scala is Martin 's language , he was anointed the " benevolent dictator " of the book 's content , but there ended up being very few issues about which we did n't ultimately all agree .
Martin wrote a great deal of it , as did Lex and I .
There is quite a lot from each of our personalities on those pages .
We published a first " PrePrint ( TM ) Edition " of the book one year ago this week , and made several updates available over time as we progressed .
Through a link on each page of this PDF our early access readers gave us invaluable feedback that helped us shape Programming in Scala into an even better book .
Last week I was in Antwerp , Belgium for the Devoxx conference , where I teamed up with Ted Neward to give a half - day Scala tutorial .
I also gave a conference talk entitled " The Feel of Scala , " in which I illustrated what Scala programming is about by showing a lot of real code and live demos .
Right after my " The Feel of Scala " talk I was scheduled to do a book signing at Computerwinkeltje , one of the two bookstores at the conference .
Given the paper books had only been completed about a week and a half earlier , and our fulfillment center had two days of holiday for Thanksgiving , our European distributor had to really rush books over the Atlantic to get them to Devoxx on time .
Computerwinkeltje ended up with 40 copies .
When I arrived for the signing they informed me that Programming in Scala had been the best selling book both days so far , and as I sat there signing books it sold out .
After that sales dropped of course , but luckily I had brought a carton of 10 books in my luggage .
After subtracting one book to give to Stephan Janssen , who organizes Devoxx , I sold the remaining nine to Computerwinkeltje the next morning , who put them back out on the table .
When I returned a couple hours later those were sold out as well .
Also , I learned this morning that due to strong orders from Amazon.uk , our European distributor has already run out of stock themselves as well and wanted to reorder .
So it has been an encouraging start .
I wanted to thank everyone who has bought our book , before or after its publication on paper , with a special thanks to the two smiling fellows in the lower left photo , who bought it at the book signing at Computerwinkeltje at Devoxx ( and gave me permission to use the photo in my blog ) .
We were a bit overwhelmed with all the orders at first , and as a result it took us a couple of weeks to get them all shipped .
But all pre-order books are out the door , if not already at their destination then on their way .
We 're shipping new orders the day they come in .
So if you do n't have one yet , you can get one here :

WASHINGTON
So much for the savior - based economy .
Tim Geithner , the learned and laconic civil servant and financial engineer , did not sweep in and infuse our shaky psyches with confidence .
For starters , the 47 - year - old ’s voice kept cracking .
Escorting us over the rickety , foggy bridge from TARP to Son of TARP by way of TALF  do n’t ask 
Geithner did not , as the president said when he drew on the wisdom of Fred Astaire , inspire us to pick ourselves up , dust ourselves off and start all over again .
The Obama crowd is hung up on the same issues that the Bush crew was hung up on last September :
Which of the potentially $ 2 or $ 3 trillion in toxic assets will the taxpayers buy and what will we pay for them ?
Despite the touting , the Treasury chief unveiled a plan short on illumination , recrimination , fine points and foreclosure closure .
The Dow collapsed on its fainting couch as Sports Illustrated swimsuit models rang the closing bell .
Researchers from Australia , Denmark , and China have combined efforts to show the feasibility of terabit - per- second Ethernet over fiber - optic cables .
The solution involves a photonic chip that uses laser light for switching signals , and a form of the exotic material type , chalcogenide .
The groups ' combined efforts are documented in a paper in the February 16 , 2009 , issue of Optics Express , which details a demonstration of 640 Gbps networking and the extension of the same approach to terabit - per - second speeds .
( See " Breakthrough switching speed with an all - optical chalcogenide glass chip : 640 Gbit/s Demultiplexing , " Leif Oxenl �we et al , Optics Express , Vol. 17 , Issue 4 . )
Ben Eggleton , the research director for Australia 's Centre for Ultrahigh bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems ( CUDOS ) , said that the problem is n't injecting that much high speed data into an optical strand , called multiplexing , but retrieving data at such high rates .
Individual lasers , operated by conventional electronics , can inject dozens of 10 Gbps streams , but in terms of retrieving that multiplexed data " at these very very high bit rates , beyond 40 Gbps , electronics is not fast enough , " Eggleton said .
In conjunction with a Danish research organization at the Technical University of Denmark , which has been working on high - speed optical networking , CUDOS developed a photonic integrated circuit that uses lasers and light in the same way a conventional electronic integrated circuit uses electrons and transistors .
Eggleton said that this multiplexing uses optical time division multiplexing ( OTDM ) which allows separation over time of signals over the same medium .
The modulation of separate , closely spaced wavelengths of light allows a fairly massive increase in capacity over today 's systems , which can carry Gbps on each of several widely spaced wavelengths .
One of the key breakthroughs researchers made was n't so much in speed but in practicality .
By using relatively traditional methods to etch a circuit out of a glassy form of a chalcogenide , arsenic trisulfide ( As 2 S 3 ) , researchers were able to reduce the waveguide that demultiplexed an incoming signal from tens of meters down to 5 cm .
Eggleton noted that non-linearity in a material is a key necessity in reducing a waveguide 's length , and that CUDOS 's materials research led it to the compound the group employed .
" We 've found a material that has 1,000 times more of this non-linearity " than previous approaches , Eggelton said .
" That allows us to achieve the same processing on a single chip " instead of spools of fiber - optic cable , as a previous high - water mark of fiber transmission rates had entailed .
Construction of a monolithic chip that could handle 640 Gbps and faster speeds would require a separate waveguide for each 10 Gbps stream .
Eggleton said that silicon - based chips could also be used in principle to achieve similar , but slower , results , but their ultimate goal was to create fully photonic chips in the same foundries that now make CMOS ( complementary metal oxide semiconductor ) integrated circuits .
" It 's years to complete , " Eggleton said , taking these research efforts into a production technology .
But these demonstrations " are starting to establish this is a serious proposition . "
It is strange to think that not too long ago there were no such things as pixels .
Before the invention of photography , artificial pixels ( short for PICture ELements ) simply did not exist .
It was n’t until the personal computer hit the mainstream did the word “ pixel ” become widely known outside of geeks , video / photographers and the CIA .
Now that several generations of designers have never known a world without pixels , it was expected that this single common component of an image would find its way onto non traditional objects .
Cristian Zuzunaga , a graduate from the UK’s Royal College of Arts , has designed this Pixel Couch that will be produced by Danish manufacturer Kvadrat and sold through Moroso .
I wonder what it would look like from far away .

Speaking out about the latest attempt to criminalize speech in Britain , Rowan Atkinson said :
“ To criticise a person for their race is manifestly irrational and ridiculous but to criticise their religion – that is a right .
That is a freedom .
The freedom to criticise ideas — any ideas even if they are sincerely held beliefs — is one of the fundamental freedoms of society .
And the law which attempts to say you can criticise or ridicule ideas as long as they are not religious ideas is a very peculiar law indeed .
It all points to the promotion of the idea that there should be a right not to be offended .
But in my view the right to offend is far more important than any right not to be offended .
The right to ridicule is far more important to society than any right not to be ridiculed because one in my view represents openness – and the other represents oppression . ”
First Amendment to the United States Constitution
“ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . ”
A relentless assault on liberty has been underway in the U.S. for decades .
There was a time , not too long ago , when Americans celebrated their voices and redressed the government when they felt passionately that it had interfered in the lives of citizens too much .
The civil rights movement of the 60's was the last era of free speech in America , even that era ended in the obstruction of liberties and free speech .
The importance of the freedom of speech cannot be overstated .
It is the most important right that we have because all others are founded upon it .
Without the freedom of speech we would not have the freedom to practice religion , whatever that may be .
The founders understood this , which is why their ancestors fled to America and why they made it the FIRST amendment to the U.S. Constitution .
They understood that without the absolute guarantee of free speech religious persecution would continue .
They also understood that if such religious persecution were to occur in America they would need to be able to petition the government in order to stand against it .
Without free speech there is no free practice of religion and without the freedom to assemble and petition there is no ability to maintain that free speech or revoke any government persecution or encroachment of those rights .
Most people forget that the first amendment also guarantees our “ right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances . ”
We usually refer to this as protesting now , which has become a bad word in the American conscience , it elicits images of riot squads , chain link fences , barricades , tear gas , bull horns , mayhem , and inconvenience .
Perhaps the latter is the most telling in this situation , inconvenience .
As a nation we 've become so accustomed to allowing our government to push us around and treat us like poorly - behaved children that we now think we are wrong to protest , that to cause any disturbance is improper of us .
Self - Determined Silence
There are many people who oppose the idea of the government restricting citizens ' liberties and even more who do nothing about it .
“ I do n't have time to ” or “ It wo n't change anything so why bother ? ” or “ Someone else will do it ” are common mantras taken up by those citizens who are too lazy , too ashamed , too afraid , or simply do n't care enough to stand up to their government .
There is a small group who spend a great deal of time blogging and writing articles , like this one , denouncing these ideas and urging citizens to create change .
This is a noble and valid gesture which has helped to create a greater amount of awareness than ever before of the obstructions of our liberties .
Is writing and speaking enough though ?
Is an editorial or a call to action enough to convince the government that they have no choice but to accept our demands ?
No , unfortunately it 's not .
Despite the overwhelming public disapproval of the war in Iraq , despite the overwhelming public demand for impeachment of President Bush while he was still in office , despite the overwhelming public disapproval of the most recent bailouts and the stimulus the government takes no action on behalf of citizens .
They simply do n't care enough about what you or I think because in spite of all our efforts we have not forced them ( government ) to care .
We allow them to continue to live in their own little bubble safe from any “ inconvenience ” of protest , they are able to carry on with “ business as usual ” .
There is a very small group of citizens who understand the power that we the people truly wield .
These are the people who actually use their voices and bodies to address the government and tell them that they will not be held down , that they will not have their liberties trampled upon ; that the power we have given them is only through the consent of the governed , the consent of the people .
It is too easy for politicians to ignore our pleas when it is only done in an online blog , or a chat room , or newspaper , or even on TV .
It is an entirely different story when a large group of citizens assemble in the same physical location and creates that inconvenience .
The government does not like us to assemble and stop traffic , to create a ruckus , to create awareness .
They understand the power that we wield when we form en masse .
We can shut entire cities down by simply gathering .
This is what occurred during the civil rights movements of the 1960s .
On August 28 , 1963 led by the great Dr. Martin Luther King , citizens gathered in an enormous rally to create the change they were seeking .
As many as 300,000 citizens came together in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D.C. , they did not ask the government for that change , they demanded it , and they did so “ illegally ” .
Dr. King was not granted the permit necessary to rally all these people , yet he did it anyway .
The fact is that requiring a permit to rally and petition the government is not even legal .
There are laws that may require it , differing by state and city , but these laws are all fake and illegal .
Again , the Constitution states that “ Congress shall make no law ” regarding the “ right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . ”
The point is that even when faced with the consequences of carrying out an “ illegal ” activity ( marching without a permit ) these patriots did so in order to inconvenience the government enough that they had to listen .
Would the same affect have been achieved if after being denied the permit Dr. King complied and instead wrote an editorial about what could have been ?
This congregation was able to shut down the entire city of Washington D.C. with their massive demonstration and bring traffic and business to a halt .
They created such a stir that “ business as usual ” could not be conducted .
The government tends to take notice when this happens .
The government relies on the inaction of citizens in order to further its own agenda , whether that is raising taxes , intervening in foreign affairs , or promoting racially dividing policy .
Politicians are savvy enough to understand that they will not completely silence us today .
With the advent of the internet communication is more readily available than at any other time in human history ; they understand this and thus seek to immobilize citizens instead .
We 've been lulled into a false sense of security pertaining our rights because we can almost freely communicate with people all over the country and world .
With this false sense of security the government has been fleecing our rights to assemble and petition in order to squash any further citizen action .
Benevolent Government ?
In the last few years plans to “ reinvigorate ” the National Mall in Washington D.C. have come to light .
Chief among these is the plan to create a protest pit ; this would “ allow ” protestors to have a safe area to congregate and would even include seats and a media area .
Many would think this to be a great gesture by the government to provide an area for demonstration .
Do not be deceived by this “ philanthropy ” , this would only serve to constrain citizens and prevent them from affecting “ business as usual ” by placing them out of sight and out of mind .
I should emphasize that this would be the only area on the National Mall where protestors could gather .
It is estimated that the area could hold up to 50,000 people , while that sounds like a lot remember that up to 300,000 gathered to march with Dr. King in 1963 and 500,000 gathered to protest prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
What would happen to the capability of gathering hundreds of thousands under these circumstances ?
It would minimize the effect of protest by creating an artificial limit on the amount of protestors in this area .
These elites , who do not want to hear you voicing your concerns and possibly influencing others , seek to remove your ability to influence by requiring protests to take place in this area , thus , marginalizing the power of free speech .
Another heinous example of government attempting to minimize citizens ' voices is the pending “ Fairness Doctrine ” .
This most unfair doctrine was first enacted in 1949 and enforced by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) .
It required that holders of broadcast licenses must present controversial issues in an “ honest , equitable , and balanced way ” , according to the commission , that is .
This basically means that broadcasters must present at least two sides to every issue .
This sounds like a good thing but really is just another encroachment on free speech , requiring broadcasters to present a view they do not condone or wish to promote .
“ Say what we want you to say , not what you think ” is basically what the government is doing with this .
The policy was later abolished in 1987 , although , as of the writing of this article talk has been re-surfacing in Washington of instilling the doctrine again .
Could this be a mere coincidence given the epidemic of bailouts and stimulus ' in Washington ?
Perhaps , it 's more likely though , that instilling “ fairness ” would prevent talk radio from exclusively denouncing ( rightfully ) government meddling in the market .
Again , this is another effort to minimize the power of free speech .
Lessons of the Founders
A basic principle that all Americans must learn to accept is that government will always seek to constrain its citizens .
The very nature of government is restrictive , although some of its actions are positive most are not .
The ruling elite are not interested in your opinion unless you are a lobbyist or special interest group .
This is a harsh reality to accept .
The government has nothing to gain by pleasing citizens , save a few powerful individuals and groups .
Most people offer nothing of value to the government ( in its eyes ) other than taxes ; this is not to say that we as citizens are of little value to society , rather that the government is of little value to us .
With the exception of a providing a military to protect and courts to uphold laws most people cannot identify something positive the government has done for them , and they should n't be able .
Their role is not to “ give ” us our rights , those exist naturally , and they merely created legislation to defend those rights .
Their role is not to “ allow ” us the freedom to practice religion as we desire , that right existed before the government did , they simply uphold those rights with laws .
Their role is not to “ provide ” us a place to assemble and petition , as free thinking citizens we possess that ability beyond any government role .
We must realize that any action the government takes in these regards is not benevolent , is not intended to protect our absolute freedoms to exercise those rights , and it is not intended to promote fairness and peace .
These actions are merely set forth so the government can pursue its ideals and shape our lives as they see fit , if you happen to espouse those same ideals they are pursuing then you may not ever have strife with them .
However , if you hold differing beliefs you will surely have a difficult time pursuing your beliefs and life under such a restrictive power .
The Constitution was specifically written to protect that minority voice , that one person who disagrees with everyone else .
Thus , under such a system ALL would be allowed to speak freely , practice any religion they see fit , and address the government when they have been denied those rights , not just the majority .
We 've become citizen - slaves to this behemoth we call the U.S. government .
This monster has created in citizens the mindset that our lives are owned and that we should be ashamed for not doing more for our government , that blind faith in it is true patriotism .
It has become so repressive that we actually believe that to speak against it is unpatriotic .
America is not just a country ; it is a mindset that we may live our lives according to our own desires , so long as those desires do not infringe on others lives .
It is the mindset that you own your life and you may speak freely , pray freely , and stand up for yourself when you are denied those rights without fear of reprisal or the disapproval of government .
It is the mindset that true patriotism is standing against even your own government when it has committed wrongs .
Unless we recapture that mindset we will be forever slaves to the governmental master .
It is a sacred right and duty of American citizens “ that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it . ”
Ordinary citizens that came generations before us did not allow the government to do whatever it wanted without letting them know .
The Boston Tea Party , the Stamp Act Riots , the Whisky Rebellion , these were all times when Americans stood up to the government , not just by talking but with actual , physical confrontation .
The threat of liberties disappearing at that time was not even present ; the conflicts were caused over taxes .
Today we barely even protest in public when taxes are raised , let alone when our liberties are stripped of us .
If the founding fathers were so wary about taxes being raised then why are we not more wary of liberties and rights being restricted now ?
If we heed the advice of the founders , who knew much more about government oppression than any of us can claim , we may be able to prevent the complete loss of our remaining liberties .
Once these liberties are lost we will realize that it is too late and know we should have acted sooner .
We can act now though , and save those precious liberties we still have .
In the words of a great young patriot , Adam Roberts ;
“ Greatness comes from people that are personally invested . ”
It 's time we honor the personal sacrifices that our forefathers made , it 's time we honor the personal hardships that Dr. King and so many others have endured in order to promote liberty and freedom .
It 's time to be personally invested .

Congressman warns that auto - bailout could lead directly to fascism in America
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Thursday , Dec 18 , 2008
Texas Congressman Ron Paul has hit out at US monetary policy , warning that fear based politics are being used to promote the bailout culture in the same way they were used to sell the Iraq war .
“ Governments that want to take over , undermine our liberties and gain more power always use the fear factor .
They did this leading up to the war in Iraq , they do it on foreign policy , now they ’re doing it on monetary , economic and financial problems . ”
Paul told the nationally syndicated Alex Jones show Wednesday .
“ They do that all the time , that is their technique , always to build a tremendous fear in the hearts of the people .
Terrorize the people and say that ‘ we are your saviors and we ’re the only ones that can take care of it ’. ”
The Congressman stated .
Paul pointed out that the use of the fear factor was never more evident than in the run up to the passage of the $ 750 billion bailout bill earlier this year when it emerged that representatives had been threatened with an economic crash and physical martial law in America .
When asked if this constituted economic terrorism , Paul replied “ Of course it is , and those responsible should be held accountable . ”
The Congressman also warned that the bailout of the auto industry could have dire consequences .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ It is extremely dangerous because although we have been creeping in that direction , this is an endorsement of nationalization .
If they keep token ownership with the corporations , which they probably will , then it ’s called fascism . ”
Paul said .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ I think everybody knows we ’re in a crisis now and they have now gotten to the point where they do n’t trust the government , which is healthy . ”
The Congressman told listeners .
“ A lot of people are begging and pleading and they ’re lining up .
But the average guy outside of Washington , especially so many of the young people are realizing that this has all been a hoax and this is the time to really expose that hoax . ”
“ We have a real opportunity to direct attention to the real culprit and that is those who control the monetary system .
Those who counterfeit our money and cause the financial bubbles and then recessions , and now are working real hard on a depression . ”
Paul continued .
“ The only thing that can counteract this is a different philosophy .
A convincing argument that free markets , sound money and no Federal Reserve and limited taxes , the things that made America great . ”
“ The system that they are trying to patch together right now will not work .
We do n’t need more regulatory agencies , all we need is the enforcement of fraud laws . ”
Paul concluded .

Comment on this article
When I was a medical student at Cambridge in the Sixties , I walked to lectures past the forbidding exterior of the Cavendish Laboratory , as famous for Crick and Watson ’s unravelling of DNA as for Rutherford ’s splitting of the atom .
One day , scrawled on the wall , was a supreme example of Cambridge graffiti : “ CRICK FOR GOD ” .
No surprise that pivotal advances in science provoke religious metaphors .
Crick and Watson ’s discovery transformed our view of life itself — from a manifestation of spiritual magic to a chemical process .
One more territorial gain in the metaphysical chess match between science and religion .
Charles Darwin ’s theory of evolution was certainly a vital move in that chess game — if not checkmate .
In an interview for God and the Scientists , Richard Dawkins declares : “ Darwin removed the main argument for God ’s existence . ”
That was n’t , of course , Darwin ’s intention .
In 1827 , he scraped into Cambridge to study for the church .
But by 1838 , with the wealth of experience from the Beagle ‘s voyage inside his head , Darwin had conceived the idea that natural selection — survival of the fittest — had created new species .
Even after she accepted his marriage proposal , Darwin ’s cousin Emma , a strict Unitarian , fretted that his heretical theories would lead to their separation in the afterlife !
Darwin agonised for more than 20 years before publishing
On the Origin of Species , and another two before he could say , in The Descent of Man , that “ Man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on Earth ” .
In the final words of that transcendent book , Darwin could n’t avoid the religious metaphor : “ Man with all his noble qualities … with his god - like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system — with all these exalted powers —
Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origins . ”
Throughout the love - hate relationship between science and Christianity , the idea that human rationality is a gift from God has frequently been used as a justification , or an excuse , for scientific inquiry .
Pope Benedict XVI has gone further .
In a speech read at La Sapienza University in Rome last year ( in the face of opposition from the academic staff ) he argued : “ If , however , reason … becomes deaf to the great message that comes from the Christian faith and its wisdom , it will wither like a tree whose roots no longer reach the waters that give it life . ”
What on earth was the pope saying ?
That only Christians can be good scientists ?
Sorry , Pythagoras ; sorry , Galen ; sorry , Einstein ; sorry , Crick .
Science has rampaged over the landscape of divine explanation , provoking denial or surrender from the church .
Christian leaders , even the Catholic church , have reluctantly accommodated the discoveries of scientists , with the odd burning at the stake and excommunication along the way .
But I was astounded to discover how topical the issue of Galileo ’s trial still is in the Vatican and how resistant many Christians are to scientific ideas that challenge scriptural accounts .
More than half of Americans , even a third of Brits , still believe that God created humans in their present form .
The process of Christian accommodation is a bit like the fate of fieldmice confronted by a combine harvester , continuously retreating into the shrinking patch of uncut wheat .
Ten days ago , on Darwin ’s birthday , Richard Dawkins , Archbishop of Atheism , and Richard Harries , former Bishop of Oxford , conducted a public conversation in the Oxford University Museum , where Bishop Sam Wilberforce and Darwin ’s champion , Thomas Henry Huxley , had debated Darwin ’s ideas in 1860 .
The two Richards were more civilised .
But inevitably , Richard H claimed for religion a territory that science can never invade , a totally safe sanctuary for Christian fieldmice .
Science is brilliant at questions that start “ how ” , but religion is the only approach to questions that start “ why ” .
Throughout history , human beings have asked those difficult “ why ” questions .
It ’s true that spiritual beliefs of one form or another are universal , almost as defining of humanity as language is .
But the universality of language and the fact that bits of the human brain are clearly specialised to do language suggest that our genes give us language - learning brains .
Is the same true of religion ?
Brain scanning has indeed shown particular bits of the brain lighting up with activity when people pray , look at pictures of the Virgin Mary or recollect intense religious experiences .
Richard Harries said : “ It would not be surprising if God had created us with a physical facility for belief . ”
But there is another interpretation , which might eventually lead to the completion of the scientific harvest .
Human beings are supremely social animals .
We recognise people and judge their feelings and intentions from their expressions and actions .
Our thoughts about ourselves , and the words we use to describe those thoughts , are infused with wishes and wants .
We feel that we are the helmsmen of our actions , free to choose , even to sin .
But increasingly , those who study the human brain see our experiences , even of our own intentions , as being an illusory commentary on what our brains have already decided to do .
Perhaps we humans come with a false model of ourselves , which works well as a means of predicting the behaviour of other people — a belief that actions are the result of conscious intentions .
Then could the pervasive human belief in supernatural forces and spiritual agents , controlling the physical world , and influencing our moral judgments , be an extension of that false logic , a misconception no more significant than a visual illusion ?
I ’m dubious about those “ why ” questions : why are we here ?
Why do we have a sense of right and wrong ?
Either they make no sense or they can be recast as the kind of “ how ” questions that science answers so well .
When we understand how our brains generate religious ideas , and what the Darwinian adaptive value of such brain processes is , what will be left for religion ?

Thanks to a new program , New Yorkers will now have yet another way to compare the relative prestige of where they live within the city : air quality .
The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene recently initiated what will be the city ’s most comprehensive air quality monitoring effort to date .
Rather than monitor air quality from the tops of buildings as the state ’s Department of Environmental Quality has done for some time at 25 locations , the new “ NYC Community Air Survey ” program has placed 150 monitoring units at street level .
The units have been both randomly and strategically placed on light poles in key areas within the city ’s five boroughs .
They will produce data that will help determine how air quality varies throughout the city where it matters most– the places where we breathe .
The Air Survey is part of Mayor Michael Bloomberg ’s quest to help New York have the best air quality of any major U.S. city .
The stations have already started collecting data about the levels of various pollutants in the air , such as ozone , sulfur dioxide , and nitrogen oxides .
Air quality has a strong relationship to human health , and problems such as asthma have become common in some of New York City ’s more heavily polluted areas .
For this reason , an effort was made to place some monitoring stations near bus stations , ferry terminals , high traffic intersections , and also near areas that are less likely to be as polluted that will provide good points of comparison , such as parks .
The Air Survey program plans to publish its first report in the later part of this year .
I ’m sure New Yorkers will be eager to hear the results– and put the data and findings to good use .

In North Dakota , oddly enough , hackers have hit on a new way to infect innocent computers : fake parking tickets that direct car owners to a site where they are instructed to download malicious software .

The software itself is disguised as a " toolbar " that car owners would need to download in order to see their crime and atone .
But it 's actually another trojan horse virus , one that installs endless popup windows and fake " antivirus " software and all that other garbage .
It would be clever if it were n't so horribly , horribly mean .
But as this technique is being used in something called Grand Forks , North Dakota , could n't the punks be caught ?
After all , somebody 's gotta be running around slapping fake tickets on random windshields , and how many people could there really be in Grand Forks ?
Eight ?

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) is predicting severe bleaching for parts of the Coral Sea , near Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef , and the Coral Triangle , causing immense damage to an important global marine environment over the next few months .
[ social_buttons ]
“ This forecast bleaching episode will be caused by increased water temperatures and is the kind of event we can expect on a regular basis if average global temperatures rise above 2 degrees . ” – Richard Leck , Climate Change Strategy Leader for WWF ’s Coral Triangle Program .
Because corals are extremely sensitive to a change in temperature , even a small increase can cause bleaching .
It occurs when the zooxanthellae – the tiny organisms that live within the coral – become expelled from the coral because of stress .
Corals depend upon the zooxanthellae to share the energy produced through photosynthesis .
The coral bleaching could have a devastating impact on coral reef ecosystems by killing coral and destroying food chains in the ocean .
Communities who depend on the oceans for their livelihoods may see a huge impact from this event .
“ Regular bleaching episodes in this part of the world will have a massive impact on the region ’s ability to sustain local communities .
In the Pacific many of the Small Island Developing States , such as the Solomon Islands , rely largely on the coast and coastal environments such as coral reefs for food supply .
This is a region where alternative sources of income and food are limited . ”
– Leck
A recent World Wildlife Fund report , Implications of Climate Change for Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef , warns that both the frequency and severity of coral bleaching will increase worldwide , and predicts that less than 5 % of the coral on Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef will remain by 2050 due to climate change .
The loss of coral would completely destroy the entire reef ecosystem .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration 's efforts to help struggling homeowners will aid " responsible " borrowers , not deadbeats or speculators , Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan said Sunday .
The plan is aimed at " folks who are playing by the rules , " Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan says .
President Barack Obama announced the plan Wednesday , saying it will help up to 9 million people keep their homes in a housing market ravaged by foreclosures .
But critics , including several leading Republicans and some commentators , said the $ 75 billion proposal will unfairly help some people at the expense of others .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs acknowledged Friday that some people who made " bad decisions " might end up getting help under the proposal .
But Donovan , Obama 's secretary of housing and urban development , told CNN's " State of the Union " on Sunday that " there are no ' flippers , ' investor - owners or scammers that are eligible for this program . "
" We 're going check everybody 's income when they come into this program .
We 're going to make sure that people are paying their bills .
And more than anything , we 're targeting the folks who are playing by the rules , " Donovan said .
The administration 's proposal would make it easier for homeowners to afford their monthly payments either by refinancing the mortgages or having their loans modified .
And it would vastly broaden the scope of the government rescue by focusing on homeowners who are still current in their payments but at risk of default .
Read more about the plan
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , a Republican who also has criticized the administration 's stimulus package , called the mortgage plan " a horrible idea . "
" About 95 percent of folks are playing by the rules and struggling , but still paying their mortgages .
The idea that somebody down the street gets a different system , I think , is ultimately something that 's going to undermine a whole lot of other folks with regard to paying their mortgage , " Sanford told " Fox News Sunday . "
In particular , he singled out a provision that would allow judges to modify or reduce the principal of loans for borrowers in bankruptcy -- an idea Sanford called " incredibly dangerous for the precedent it sets . "
But Donovan told CBS 's " Face the Nation " that judges already have that power for second homes or vacation homes .
" It 's only for people who have one home and are living in it or are in trouble where you can't have a modification of that loan in bankruptcy , " he said .
But he said the administration would limit the plan to existing loans , not future ones , and considered it a " last resort . "
" There seems to be growing consensus that this is an important part of the solution , " he said .
About $ 50 billion of the money would come from the $ 700 billion financial industry bailout package , a senior administration official said Friday .
Nationalized mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will contribute more than $ 20 billion to the loan modification program , mainly to subsidize interest rates so troubled borrowers ' monthly payments can be lowered to affordable levels .
But those companies are on shaky financial ground themselves and are expected to report billions in losses in the next week or two .
To stabilize them , the foreclosure prevention program calls for doubling their lines of credit with the federal government to $ 200 billion each .
Donovan said 45 percent of home sales in December were " distressed , " meaning either sellers were facing foreclosure or the homes were already seized by the bank , driving down home prices further in an already - battered market .
" We 've got to make clear , here , that a foreclosure hurts every American , " he told CNN .
In releasing his proposal Wednesday , Obama said it would help both responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices and borrowers either at risk of or already in default .
But it does virtually nothing for the unemployed , who often do n't have enough income to make any reasonable monthly payment affordable .
And since it relies more heavily on lowering interest rates than on reducing principal , it does little for borrowers concerned their homes will never recoup their value .

Workers march in Noumea , Kanaky , May 1 , 2008 .
Photo USKTE .
By Bernard Alleton , translated by Sam Wainwright for Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal
Rouge , issue 2280 -- December 25 , 2008 --
One year after its founding by the Kanak and Exploited Workers Union ( Union syndicale des travailleurs kanaks et des exploités : USTKE [ 1 ] ) , the Kanaky Labour Party ( : PT ) held its first congress in November 2008 in Noumea .
The Revolutionary Communist League ( Ligue communiste révolutionnaire : LCR [ 2 ] ) sent a representative who conveyed a message of fraternal solidarity .
The balance sheet of first year of the Kanaky PT is largely positive .
In the municipal elections in March , four months after it was formed , the PT ran candidates in fourteen of the territory ’s thirty - three communes resulting in thirty elected representatives .
This demonstrates its genuine implantation .
More generally , the PT knew how to take on the lethargy of the other parties that claim to struggle for independence .
They have been integrated into the institutions of colonial administration , set in place in Paris through the Matignon - Oudinot Accords of 1988 and the Noumea Accords of 1998 .
This has led them to favour the defence of these institutions and the place of individuals within them as the creation of structures for a future independent country .
For several months now independence has been put back into the political debate in a way that does not treat it like some distant dream .
This also explains the radicalisation of the local pro-colonial right - wing forces , which according to Pierre Frogier ( UMP ) [ 3 ] want “ to purge this question of independence , which people do n’t talk about anymore , so we can move onto other things ” .
They propose to finish with the “ Kanak problem ” with the 2014 referendum on independence .
This is also the line of the Socialist Party ( PS ) , for whom “ the concept of independence no longer has meaning in a multipolar world and a globalised economy ” .
They all effectively deny the fact that since 1986 New Caledonia has been on the UN list of territories to be decolonised and the UN declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples .
The PT congress was an opportunity to make an assessment of the twenty years of the “ transfer of competencies ” which required Kanaks to be drawn into the centre of governmental machinery .
For the most part the promises made by the colonial state have not been kept .
The training which was supposed to allow Kanaks to reach every level of society has failed , to the extent that not one is a lawyer , judge or state prosecutor ; and only one has become a doctor !
Dozens of young Kanaks have studied in France .
On return they cannot generally access jobs corresponding to their qualifications , so they opt for self - exile in neighbouring countries or France .
Ecological issues
In both secondary and tertiary education the transfer of competencies is promised to be “ on the way ” .
In the meantime , young people continue to learn in earnest about the geography of the Alps and the machinery of the European Union .
What happened in Kanaky before France “ discovered ” the territory in 1853 ?
Who was Chief Atta ï [ 4 ] ?
What is the code de l’indigénat [ 5 ] that governed the lives of their parents and grandparents until 1946 ?
So many questions the answers to which Kanaks only find outside of school .
The Kanak languages still have no place in the schools , the French Senate even voted on June 18 , 2008 , that they have no place in the constitution of the republic .
The PT proposes an education system that takes the needs of young Kanaks as its starting point and that is adapted to their culture and environment .
Economic policy , notably the development of downstream processing of nickel by multinational corporations , has been implemented largely excluding the local population .
[ 6 ]
Les Métropolitains ( French expatriates ) have come to make the most of the boom and been hired in big numbers .
In the south the construction of the Goro processing plant has brought with it years of struggle against the destruction of the environment caused by the new industrial processes . [ 7 ]
Several million euros have gone to carefully chosen politicians because of these environmental battles .
Right in the thick of these struggles , the PT has not taken a backwards step .
It puts its demand for the respect of the territory ’s ecological future at the centre of its resolutions .
For the multinationals , their approach to the exploitation of this ore centres on the fluctuations of the price of nickel on the world market , dropping from US $ 50,000 a tonne in July 2007 to less than $ 10,000 today .
What might happen “ post - nickel ” is not really their concern .
The local deposits are estimated to last for about another one hundred years .
What will become of the territory when its mineral resources have been exhausted for the benefit of the multinationals and not invested in the country ’s long term development ?
The PT asks these questions and demands , for the future of Kanaky , an overall mining plan of action and a new distribution of the wealth produced .
If ecology has an important place in the program of the PT it is because it is a necessary condition for the continuation of Kanak culture , in which humans draw their life force from the earth and the natural world .
It is also a pressing necessity in the French colonies in which , by deliberate agreement , the Kyoto Protocol is not applicable .
Some twenty pesticides , banned in France because of the danger they pose , are allowed and used .
There are no laws relating to the protection of the coastline .
The PT is the only party to have written into its constitution that “ the protection of the environment is an integral part of its struggle ” .
Colonial justice
The provincial elections in May will be the last before the referendum on self - determination foreshadowed by the Noumea Accord .
Ratified by a vote in 1999 , the accord set a referendum for 2014 .
Consequently , the next elections will be very important for shaping the future of the country .
The view of the PT is clear : Kanaks are ready for independence .
If they wait until the colonial power is ready to give it to them ( as it keeps telling them , in a paternalistic way ) then they must wait several more decades to be trained up and reap the benefits of colonisation .
The French minister for education Xavier Darcos declared again in October 2008 that he was still “ personally in favour ” of “ school curricula recognising the positive role of the French presence in the overseas territories ” .
He did not specify how long he thought colonial rule should continue .
The PT is firmly in favour of a move to complete independence in 2014 .
The French colonies that won independence after the Second World War were no more ready and often had fewer natural resources .
The PT ’s claim to independence has got the pro-colonial right wing especially worried .
This explains in part the increased repression of the USTKE unionists .
Police and judicial harassment of union leaders , early morning searches and interrogations , attacks on picket lines , and sentences by the colonial justice system of several months in prison and tens of thousands of euros in fines are all signs that the colonial state is taking a tougher line .
Self - determination
Unfortunately in this context the parties of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front ( Front de la libération nationale kanak et socialiste : FLNKS [ 8 ] ) have not shown any solidarity at all , preferring to continue to soak up the spoils of their deal with the state .
The basic principles of the independence struggle , reaffirmed by the PT , have long since been packed away by the FLNKS ; despite its status at the UN as the legitimate representative of the Kanak peoples ’ right to independence .
The appearance of the PT on the electoral scene has pushed the Union calédonienne ( Caledonian Union , UC ) and the Parti de liberation kanak ( Palika - Kanak Liberation Party ) , the main components of the FLNKS , to add a dash of pro-independence talk to their rhetoric , but without questioning the essentials of a society founded on such an inequitable sharing of wealth .
For the PT challenging the social and economic system that continues to make the very rich even richer while driving the poor into further poverty , especially the indigenous Kanak people , is the basis for a viable independent country .
The challenge is not one of cutting themselves off from the world or throwing non-Kanaks into the sea , it is about really allowing the people to decide how they want to live , on what economic basis and in what framework of international relations .
The PT congress decided to keep Kanaky as the name of an independent country and that the flag should still be the one popularised by the FLNKS since 1984 .
The PT congress also adopted several motions detailing the program that it will campaign on for the upcoming elections , including : the protection of local jobs and control over immigration ( the number of settlers has increased by 20 % in the last ten years ) ; to reopen a discussion on housing policy ( significant shanty towns have grown up around Noumea ) ; the development of regions where there is no nickel ; the future of the fishing industry and fish farming .
In France the PS today , just as when it was in power , does not support independence .
It only speaks out to defend the generous retirement benefits of public servants in the territory , in a place where the minimum wage is way less than the France ’s own indexed guaranteed minimum wage .
The New Anti-Capitalist Party , like the LCR before it , supports the Kanak people ’s right to self - determination and their right to live with dignity in their own land .
It will lend its support to the PT candidates in the provincial elections next May .

1 . I just want you locals to know ... you are n't fooling me , or anyone else for that matter .
You do realize when I ask for your ID card or Drivers license , it does show your address , and that you are in fact from the very town you are renting a room in ?
I guess that last time you came in with a different skanky whore , you must have forgot it was I who helped you then as well as this time , with yet , another skanky whore .
I am aware that men cheat , and women do too , but at least do n't be stupid enough to rent a room 3 blocks from where you live with your spouse .
And , no matter how much I may be temped , you do not have to remind me that " You never saw me here , okay ? "
I wo n't tell your wife / husband that you are banging someone else , just do n't fuck up my hotel room , and leave your nasty ass used condoms in the friggin bathtub , fair enough ?
You all think you can fool me by saying you are having remodeling done on your house , and thats why you are renting a room .
Ya , right .
And that girl you are with , ya know , the one with smeared eyeliner up to her eyebrows , sores on her chin and around her lips , and serious bed head , with extra grease is your wife ?
I doubt it , since you are driving a Mercedes and wearing a cardigan .
2 .
Now , I love seeing people come and visit our town and need a place to stay for the night , but if you read the sign outside of our building , you will see that IT IS NOT A FLEAMARKET .
No , you cannot bargain with me for a cheaper room .
IF you have AAA , or are a member of AARP , then I will gladly give you a discount .
But when I say our rooms are $ 85 a night , I mean just that .
I will not sell you the room for $ 50 because you are arriving late , and wo n't be in the room that long .
You do not get another discount if you skip the " FREE BREAKFAST " .
Hey jackass , it 's free , so eat the fucking waffles .
Just because you are n't going to swim or dirty all the towels , I will not lower your rate !!!
IF YOU WANT TO PAY $ 50 FUCKING DOLLARS FOR A ROOM , THEN GO TO MOTEL 6.3 .
It never ceases to amaze me when I get those random couples who clearly admit why they are really there .
The ones who say " How much for 1 hour ? "
Sorry , but we do not rent rooms by the hour , maybe you should try the flea infested , piss stained carpet motel behind us .
They will be happy to take your money to supply their next fix .
I really enjoy those of you who feel they need to tell me that they are to report back to the army base by noon tomorrow , and you need to get one more piece of ass first , but I do n't really care what you do .
Just keep it to yourself .
I must say , you are entertaining though .
And props to those few guys who manage to bring 2 , yes 2 , skanky whores in .
Your mother must be proud .
There is some anti-bacterial soap on the bathroom counter .
Dont forget to wash your genitals .
4 . I cannot stress enough about the parents who dont watch their kids .
When you come to town to play baseball or visit family , that doesnt mean your parenting goes out the window .
I know , I understand you never get to get away yourself , but come on .
While you are hanging out getting drunk by the pool , or on the balcony outside your door , your kids are running down the halls and knocking on every single fucking door on their way .
So , while my guests are calling at midnight because your brats woke them up by banging on their windows , you are too drunk to care .
Instead , I have go outside and scan the area for little pre-puberty teens , and tell them to stop .
I 've even been threatened that guests would call the cops because of your kids .
I love kids , but I dont understand what makes you think that it is acceptable for you to allow this .
And when it is breakfast time , please monitor how much food your child puts on his / her plate .
We would be able to feed all the poor in town with the food your kids waste .
Seriously , have you ever used syrup in your home ?
It pisses me off when people ( adults included ) cant wait for the syrup to stop pouring BEFORE they decide to walk 20 feet to their table .
Jerks .
And before I go , just a few quick notes to a few of my favorite kinds of people :
To the guy who left a big squishy turd in the jacuzzi , we thank you .
It made our day .
Now people can stop wondering why we charge desposits .
Oh yes , deposits .
When you dont want to leave a credit card # , you have to pay a cash deposit .
Otherwise how will we pay for someone to shampoo the carpet because you pissed on it ?
I assure you , the housekeepers dont really like picking up your dogs shit either .
To those 2 - 3 guys that have absolutly no respect for women , you make me want to spit in your coffee maker .
To the man who left his crack pipe behind , thanks , I 've always wanted one .
Stop putting porn under the mattresses , its embarrassing when we forget to look , and an old elderly couple finds it .
To the drug dealers , do you think its not noticible that you have someone coming and going every 10 minutes ?
Yeah , now I understand why the police stop by now and then .
Dont sell sex from our hotel room , dont make meth in the bath tub , and dont steal our TV's .
To the people who use our lobby hotel computer , even though you are not a guest , when we say " Free WiFi " that means for hotel paying customers .
Do not check your email , do your homework , or take the online traffic school on our computer .
To the scuzzy lady who stole the entire plate of saugage , I saw you put it in your coat , I hope it gives you heartburn .
Pillows are NOT COMPLIMENTARY .
You may not take them with you when you check out .
The same goes for the towel 's too .
When you can clearly see that you are old enough to be my father , and in some cases , grandfather , that does not mean ask me out for drinks .
I am not attracted to your ear hair , age spotted hands , or Old Spice aroma .
If I seem friendly , it 's simply because I am being friendly .
Do not take it as a sign that I want old man sex .
Last but certainly not least , to those men who hit on me while I check you into your room .
Just because you are already at a hotel room , NO , I do not want to visit you in your room after I get off work .
No I do not want to teach you how to make a bubble bath , or check to see if your mattress is springy enough .
I am working , I am there for a pay check , and to smile and be as nice as I can possibly be .
But after you harrass me in the elevator , in the parking lot , in the lobby , at the pool , near the candy machine , I will start to give you dirty looks and might not be so friendly anymore .
I DO NOT want to have sex with you .
I never expect tips when I bring you extra pillows or towels , but I want to shout out that I appreciate those of you who do tip at hotels .
I spend hours walking to over a hundred rooms to show people how to turn on the A/C or heater , bring pillows , towels , extra shampoo , ashtrays , and it 's always a nice surprise when I get passed a couple bucks .
Especially when I have to clean up after you in the breakfast room , because you could not throw away your plate of chewed up then spit out sausage .
This is not a restaurant and it is self serve , so maybe you should self serve your garbage to the trash can , and I will just wipe the table clean for the next person .
I am there to make sure there is fresh coffee , batter for the waffles , and the milk is cold , not to clean up after your 5 kids who cant pour a glass of orange juice without spilling one entire cup on the floor .
Seriously , if they cant pour a glass of juice , then just maybe ... you should do it for them ?
Thanks , and have a great day !!
Trouble in the Hoosier State this week , with some Indy cops busted for ripping off pot dealers and selling their wares and a Muncie drug task force being investigated over its asset forfeiture practices .
Also , a Wyoming jailer steals his cop father 's drug dog pot stash , and a Massachusetts cop cops a plea .
Let 's get to it :
In Indianapolis , three Indianapolis Metropolitan police officers were arrested Tuesday for allegedly participating in a marijuana trafficking ring .
Officers James Davis , 33 , Jason Edwards , 37 , and Robert Long , 34 , were arrested by FBI agents after a federal indictment charging them with conspiracy to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute was unsealed Tuesday morning .
Long , a narcotics detective , was described as the leader of the conspiracy and is accused of illegally seizing the drug and informing a fourth defendant he was under investigation .
Edwards is accused of illegally seizing marijuana and money , and the indictment says Davis illegally entered apartments to steal marijuana and money .
In Gillette , Wyoming , a former Gillette police officer and Campbell County jailer was arrested last Friday for stealing marijuana and giving it to a woman currently in prison on drug charges .
Thomas Brent Clark , 23 , stole the marijuana from a vehicle belonging to his father , a canine officer for the Uinta County Sheriff 's Department .
His father kept the marijuana in the car for training purposes .
Clark was a Gillette police officer from January to March , when he was terminated .
The marijuana theft occurred in February .
Clark gave several ounces of marijuana to the woman , whom he met while working as a jailer at the county jail .
He now faces charges of delivery of marijuana and conspiracy to deliver marijuana .
He is out on bond and awaits an arraignment date .
In Boston , a former Swampscott police officer pleaded guilty June 12 to federal charges he sold oxycodone and cocaine .
Thomas Wrenn , 38 , was arrested in March after buying 50 pills from a police informant , but his colleagues had been watching him since they were tipped off to his drug use last year .
Federal prosecutors alleged he had distributed illegal pain relievers on about 20 occasions in the past five years , and distributed cocaine on at least three occasions in 2006 .
Wrenn resigned from the force after his arrest .
In Muncie , Indiana , the Muncie - Delaware County Drug Task Force came under scrutiny at a circuit court hearing last Friday .
Delaware Circuit Court 2 Judge Richard Dailey conducted the hearing into the status of more than 50 asset forfeiture cases filed by the task force , and the court heard testimony that seized cash and goods were routinely funneled into task force bank accounts in violation of state law .
Judge Dailey fended off repeated efforts by Delaware County Prosecutor Mark McKinney to thwart the probe .
McKinney unsuccessfully argued that Dailey had no right to review confidential agreements that also included the names of cooperating witnesses or other information key to criminal investigations .
McKinney is the target of professional misconduct complaint filed by Muncie Mayor Sharon McShurley charging he misled local courts about the cases , some of which have been pending for years .
You look at me every day , Anathem .
First from the top of my desk where I was going to get to you the day I brought you home from Costco .
But life is busy with three kids , a job and school .
You understood .
You moved to the shelf above the desk after a few weeks .
You knew I was not ignoring you .
I am going to read you .
No , seriously , I 'm going to reach up right now and crack you open .

Chris Brown Facebook Photos and Statement
Photo of Chris Brown and mystery woman from Myspace via MediaTakeOut.com
has issued his first statement following his attack on girlfriend Rihanna by posting a message on his personal Facebook profile .
Brown posted a status update on his personal Facebook page which reads " You 'll begin to see her true colors .
Believe it ! "
( See screen capture below )
The rapper also changed his relationship status to single , effectively dumping Rihanna via the social networking site .
According to reports , Brown also updated his profile picture on his private page - listed under his full name , , with a photo of himself and another woman , whom some are calling his " new love interest , " and speculating is the one behind the argument which escalated into physical violence early Sunday morning .
MediaTakOut.com also has a photo of Brown in bed with a woman , and claims the image was anonymously sent to Rihanna just days before the assault .
There has been much speculation on what caused the argument , and it is likely the only two who will ever know the truth of what went down that night are Rihanna and Chris Brown , however , if Brown actually posted the comment attributed to him on Facebook , he clearly is n't taking responsibility for his actions , and is basically saying she deserved it .
When I told friends I 'd be staying at the No - Tel Motel , one of them suggested I bring a black light so I could check the furniture for body fluids .
At first , I thought it was a good idea .
But when I saw the place , I decided that I really did n't want to know .
Driving around the neighborhood on a warm October night , I started to feel nervous .
I had shown up around 9 p.m. , but no one was in the fully - lit office .
There was a sign on the door at the 2425 N. Oracle Road hotel that pledged someone 's return in an hour .
The hotel seemed dead .
One or two cars ; no people .
I needed to kill time .
The area around North Oracle Road is studded with once - glitzy motels , porn shops , strip joints and warehouses .
Turning up West Miracle Mile , I encountered more of the same -- buildings with peeling paint and people drinking out of bottles wrapped in paper bags .
Folks have been saying for years that places like the No - Tel , with its " heated wa - wa beds " and free porn , are headed for extinction .
Situated between an empty lot and a cookie - cutter Walgreen's , the No - Tel is made up of a dark , lonely parking lot bracketed by two rows of rooms and a dry 8 - foot - deep pool .
A man in a minivan pulled up just as I was trying the door to the office for the second time .
He waved -- which surprised me -- and then parked in a carport beside one of the rooms .
Once inside the office , the man stepped behind a flimsy plastic barricade and asked me if I had been waiting long .
No , I replied .
I looked around as I penciled in my name and address on a small square of white paper .
No guests , a sign read .
Great .
" You staying alone ? " the man asked after I told him I might be staying for multiple nights .
I had left the spot marked " Guest " blank .
The thought of being in this place all by myself made me feel queasy .
Just to leave the option open -- in case I lost my mind -- I told him my " friend " might be staying with me .
The man , with what I perceived as a slight look of disapproval , took down my friend 's first name , waving a hand in my face as I tried to spell his last name .
The first name was sufficient .
I gave the man $ 40 for one night ; he gave me $ 5 change and a key to room Number 6 .
I walked to my car and collected my things .
After unlocking the door , I plunked my bag on the double - sized bed .
A deep breath followed :
The room smelled of cigarette smoke mixed with that universal hotel - motel odor .
It was sparsely furnished with a bed , a rickety chest of drawers and a stained gray metal chair .
A grimy air conditioner was attached to the wall , just beneath the window .
Mirrors were hung on the ceiling over the bed .
Turning on the TV , I witnessed a woman pleasuring herself with a pink dildo .
I then inspected the bathroom .
The sink , though old , looked like it worked well enough .
The ringed toilet had an early - industrial appearance to it , like it would look natural next to a foot - pedaled dental drill .
The shower was untouchable -- despite having a " Sanitary Bath Mat " tossed in front of it .
Years of muck had accumulated on the tiles , creating a brown , streaked effect .
It looked like a bomb had gone off inside .
I sat on the lumpy bed .
On TV , a woman wearing pantyhose moaned as she dry - humped a man with a mullet .
Melancholy wafted over me as the air conditioner strained to cool the room .
A few minutes later , I walked outside to get a pad of paper out of the car .
After taking three steps , a weathered man riding a bike came to a screeching halt several feet in front of me .
Surprised , I took a step back , and my eyes immediately focused on his scraggly salt and pepper beard .
" Hey , " he said in a high - pitched voice , looking like he wanted to start a conversation .
I did n't want to , so I muttered a greeting and kept walking to my car .
The man dropped the bike and scampered into the room next door to mine .
I saw a pair of toes wriggling on the edge of the bed , as the door , which had been slightly ajar when I arrived , slammed shut .
I was heading back to my room , pad in hand , when I noticed movement in my neighbor 's window : I saw a pair of eyes watching me .
Quickening my pace , I reached my room and locked the door behind me .
Later , I stepped out to get a soda from a new - looking machine next to the empty pool .
I heard my neighbor 's door open slightly , and a pair of eyes darted after me as I walked across the lot .
When I got to the machine , the door shut suddenly .
Now my neighbors were watching me from the window again .
Returning to the room , I triple - checked the lock on my door .
Feeling drained and paranoid , I lay on the bed and watched a couple go at it on TV .
Eventually , I drifted off .
Day 2
WHEN I WOKE UP THE NEXT morning , I had a strong desire to leave .
Taking a walk around the No - Tel , I noticed the chain link fence surrounding the pool had big Xs on it .
No admittance .
Looking down the road from the parking lot entrance , I saw two women crossing the street at the nearby intersection .
One woman wore a clear raincoat and carried a matching parasol .
She was trying her hardest to ignore the other woman , who seemed to be babbling incoherently and shaking her head .
Upon closer inspection , I realized the talkative woman had a hole in the side of her face .
Walking back to my room , I felt dirty .
Showering at home seemed preferable to cleaning up at the motel , so I packed my things .
I decided to leave my motel key and check into another room when I came back , in an effort to escape my freaky neighbors .
Returning two hours later , I strode into the office to find the man sitting in a recliner behind the plastic barricade .
I paid for two more nights and told him I did n't have a guest this time .
He put me in room Number 5 - - right next to my old room .
The man 's minivan was parked just outside my door .
My new place was a lot like the old one , except there was wood paneling on the walls and the ceiling did n't have mirrors .
Perhaps the lack of mirrors made this the " single person " room .
The bathroom was basically the same -- the new shower was unfortunately my old shower 's twin .
After a couple hours of flipping through channels and putzing around with my GameBoy Advance , I decided to walk to the Walgreen 's next door .
I 'm the type of person who usually knows what he wants when he steps into a store ; I do n't browse much .
But today - - for some reason -- I walked up and down the aisles , looking at nothing in particular .
No one was talking to me , but it was a comfort to know that the potential for non-creepy human contact was there .
Eventually , I decided upon some Pez and a newspaper .
The cashier made no eye contact as he mechanically rung me up .
I followed a man up the sidewalk toward the No - Tel Motel , as he pushed his walker against the flow of traffic .
I was lonely again .
Back in my room , I absent - mindedly glanced over the newspaper .
I was going stir-crazy .
Checking the time , I remembered a female stripper friend of mine told me to swing by a nearby club for a cocktail in between dances .
After shoving a handful of Pez into my mouth , I locked my stuff in my car .
A worldly friend of mine was adamant about the No - Tel locks not working too well .
I did n't bother asking her how she knew that .
I immediately felt out of place when I walked into Curves Cabaret , which bills itself as one of Tucson 's favorite adult hotspots .
Streams of women -- of every shape and size -- circulated the black - lit room like hawks , picking off men with wads of cash in their hands .
There were short , chubby women with large breasts , and tall , wispy women with no cleavage to speak of .
I spotted my friend , who told me she had just made $ 150 in less than an hour .
We chatted for a bit , and then I watched as she went to work on a middle - aged fellow across the room .
I had no idea she was so flexible .
A woman in a neon - yellow thong gently raked my back with her fingernails and asked if I wanted a dance .
It struck me how abruptly she turned away when I told her I was OK .
Feeling a little flustered -- like a goldfish in a tank full of piranhas - - I kept telling myself that if someone got too friendly with me , I could bust out with the magic phrase : " I 'm gay . "
A couple of off - duty strippers sitting next to me asked if I could watch their things while they freshened up .
I said sure ; I did n't have much of a choice .
" They were all up in my stuff , so I just needed a drink , " one of the ladies said about the hordes of hooting men when they returned .
" I know how you feel , " I replied , just as a waitress touched my thigh , looked into my eyes and asked if I wanted another beer .
Feeling antsy , I left .
I sat on the patio by the pool for a bit as the sun went down , and then went inside .
It seemed quiet .
Too quiet .
Day 3
EVEN THOUGH THE ROOM was obviously meant to be private -- the drapes would n't open and there was tape over the peephole -- I did n't feel very secure .
I kept getting the feeling I was being watched .
Around 3 p.m. , a friend of mine dropped by to do lunch at La Fuente , a family - owned restaurant that has been around for more than 40 years .
I had n't been eating regularly since the beginning of my stay , which may have been contributing to my unease .
My friend and I started walking up the street .
After crossing Grant Road , we ran into two guys waving orange flags .
I asked them what they were doing .
A tall , ruddy - cheeked fellow seemed uneasy about speaking to me .
The other man , named Fred , however , was eager to talk .
He told me Teen Challenge , a drug - recovery program he was in , was having a car wash up the road .
I chatted with him for a bit .
Originally from Phoenix , he said he had to get away from his life up there for a few weeks to get clean .
There was something straightforward and hopeful about him that I had n't seen since the beginning of my stay at the No - Tel .
I thought he was young -- in his mid-20s at the most .
He turned out to be 31 .
Radiating sunshine , he told me how Teen Challenge was helping him to see his potential and stay focused .
" We 're all here for a purpose , " he said .
" It 's about Jesus . "
My friend and I said goodbye to Fred and continued walking up the street .
We passed three men sitting around a table draped in an American flag .
Nobody was getting a car wash .
A seemingly endless stream of motels followed .
Two shirtless old men on bicycles rode by us as downtown loomed in the distance .
Eventually , we came to La Fuente , a building that looked like a bunch of brightly - colored cubes nestled between yet another motel and a decaying home .
Despite its location , La Fuente is a classy joint -- especially inside , which is tastefully decorated with Mexican art and plants .
An autographed portrait of a smiling George W. Bush was hung next to the door .
My friend and I arrived during a lull in business .
The restaurant was practically deserted , and employees were busy setting up the place for the dinner rush .
Despite the warm atmosphere , I did n't feel like talking .
I was hungrier than I thought , though .
After eating , we walked back to the No - Tel .
My friend left , and I went back to my room .
A big cockroach was sitting on my bed when I opened the door .
Another one scurried along the ceiling in the bathroom .
I do n't like cockroaches , so it was hard for me to keep my mind off of them as I reclined on the bed and read a book .
It was busier at the No - Tel than it had been on the previous nights .
Doors kept slamming , and I could hear my neighbor 's porn blaring through the thin wall .
I took a peek outside and noticed a shirtless man standing motionless in the parking lot , staring at the entrance .
I just wanted to go to bed .
Day 4
WHEN I AWOKE , I discovered the cockroaches were in full force .
I found one hiding in the shower stall .
It defied all attempts to kill it .
I started feeling emotional , like my neuroses were taking over my senses .
I kept getting a crawling sensation on my skin , and I paced back and forth .
To make sure no one was watching me , I checked a hole in the wall that was covered with black masking tape .
I kept washing my hands .
Touching anything in the room made me feel dirty .
I had to get out .
Walking up Oracle , I noticed a man and a woman across the street , zigzagging as they shouted things .
I could n't make out what they were saying over the noise of traffic .
I felt like they were yelling at me .
Reluctantly , I went back to the office and paid for one more night .
As I paid , I told a friend who had just called me on my cell phone about all the cockroaches I 'd encountered .
Usually , I would n't keep talking on the phone while being helped .
Manners were becoming meaningless , however .
My mind swam ; words tumbled out of my mouth .
I had to stop myself in mid-sentence to focus on what I saying .
" I 'm not sure how much more of this I can take , " I told her , as I closed the office door behind me .
" I feel really depressed .
I feel like people are watching me . "
" Do you want to get a drink ? " she asked .
" No , it would probably just send me on a downward spiral , " I replied , walking through the parking lot .
I hung up .
Locking the door behind me , I poked around my room .
Behind a chair was a small closet .
Half expecting a corpse to fall out , I opened the door very slowly and peeked inside .
I was getting bent out of shape over nothing .
Next , I looked through the chest of drawers in search of a Bible , a staple item of inns everywhere .
Two of the six drawers lacked bottoms .
One of those bottomless drawers was apparently home to a cockroach that dropped to the floor and ran under the bed .
No Bible .
I 'm not a religious person , but I felt like reading it .
I looked at myself in the medicine chest mirror in the bathroom .
Splashing cold water on my face , I noticed the dark lines under my eyes .
Half asleep , I leaned forward and tapped the mirror with my forehead .
It was then that I realized the medicine chest door opened .
Not wanting to touch it , I covered my hand with a plastic bag from Walgreen 's and unlatched it .
Its interior was filthy , with bits of singed tissue in front of a gaping hole burned in the wall .
Odd .
I realized that the hole , at least 1 inch in diameter , led to the medicine chest in the room I stayed in my first night .
Maybe the hole was something innocent .
People could have been passing notes between rooms .
Or maybe it was for drugs .
I instinctively sniffed the air for the scent of bitter almonds -- which is what I 've heard crystal meth smells like -- but detected nothing .
Then again , it could have been some kind of glory hole for the sexually adventurous .
Strange visions of men trying to mount the medicine chest filtered through my mind .
Feeling mischievous , I thought about using a pen to push open the door on the other side of the hole .
There were now people in the other room , however .
I could hear moaning coming from their TV .
Pressing my ear against the wall , I decided not to push my luck .
My nerves were frayed , and I just wanted to go home .
Clutching my pepper spray , I tried to fall asleep .
Instead , I tossed and turned as the hours went by .
My skin was crawling .
I thought people were at the door .
I saw things dash across the wall out of the corner of my eye .
An uneasy , dreamless sleep descended upon me .
Around 2 a.m. , I woke up .
I was sweating .
Everything was quiet and my room was dark .
I had to get out of there .
Like a whirlwind , I packed my things and loaded up my car .
The engine started ; the car shifted into gear , and I was gone .
A wave of relief rolled over me as I saw the red and yellow No - Tel sign in my rear - view mirror .
I had a sneaking suspicion that the No - Tel Motel had many more secrets hidden away in its crumbling walls .
I just did n't want to stay any longer to find out what they were .
If only cockroaches could talk ...
On December 18 , 2008 , the Food and Drug Administration ruled the natural sweetener Truvia “ generally safe ” for use in foods and beverages .
Truvia ( trade name Rebiana ) is comprised of a diterpene called steviol glycoside , which is isolated from the extracts of the leaves of the plant Stevia rebaudiana bertoni .
The herb Stevia — basically the leaves of the plant — has been available for years , so steviol glycoside is nothing new , per se .
Cargill Food and Ingredient Systems now markets Truvia as a singular , “ fully - characterized product ” ( Stevia , by comparison is a witch ’s brew of anywhere from 40 to 200 compounds ) .
More interesting data about Truvia can be found here .
As a result of the FDA ’s ruling , Coca - Cola Company will soon launch a new line of reduced - calorie drinks with the most prominent being a new version of Sprite called Sprite Green ( comes in a nifty aluminum can ) .
Stevia was purportedly discovered by Moises Santiago Bertoni in 1887 while exploring the forests of Paraguay — Stevia rebaudiana ‘s natural habitat ( see : Econ. Bot. 1983 , 37 , 74-82 ) .
Additionally , the plant had been identified in Korea , China and Japan ( J. Med. Chem . 1981 , 24 , 1269 –1271 ) .
Word spread about the plant and eventually Stevia made its way to the US ( courtesy of the Department of Agriculture ) in 1918 due to the growing interest in its strong sweetness .
A wide array of physiological studies determined that the sweet sensation of Stevia derives from the presence the compound steviol glycoside .
Since then , several studies have been reported on its structure and function of steviol glycoside including stereochemical analysis ( J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963 , 85 , 2305 –2309 ) and metabolic analyses ( J. Agric .
Food Chem. 2006 , 54 , 2794–2798 ) .
In the spirit the Truvia saga , I figured that I ’d cover its first total synthesis of steviol methyl ester , which Mori and co-workers first reported ( Tetrahedron Lett. 1970 , 11 , 2411-2414 ) .
Starting from the tricyclic methyl ester , Mori protected the aldehyde then installed ketone by way of a hydroboration - oxidation and ensuing Jones oxidation .
Deprotection of the dioxolane was accomplished using aqueous acid in acetone followed by tandem acid-catalyzed aldol addition to furnish the 1,3 - ketol , which was converted to the 1,3 - dione via second Jones oxidation .
Clemmenson reduction afforded the 1,2 - ketol ( I encourage you to push the arrows for that transformation ) , which was converted to the allylic alcohol by methylenation .
As is the case with most “ new ” sweeteners , Stevia has been the subject of criticism over toxicological effects .
One study , conducted by John Pezzuto and co-workers at the University of Chicago , concluded that steviol is actually metagenic ( PNAS 1985 , 82 , 2478-2482 ) .
However , the asterisk to this scientific study — “ steviol is mutagenic toward S. typhimurium strain TM677 ” and not human cells — should clearly be taken into consideration when weighing the toxicity of the supplement as a whole .
Just so we ’re all on the same page , the “ S ” in “ S. typhimurium ” stands for salmonella — a bacterium .
All in all , I think it ’ll pretty interesting to watch more information about Truvia find its way into the public eye .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Interest rates on standard U.S. 30 - year mortgages dropped in the latest week to levels just shy of record lows as concerns of a deepening recession boosted the appeal of fixed - rate investments , Freddie Mac said on Thursday .
The average fixed 30 - year mortgage rate declined to 5.04 percent in the week ending Thursday , from 5.16 percent in the previous period , Freddie Mac said in a statement .
That was close to the 4.96 percent reached in mid-January , which was the lowest rate since Freddie Mac began its survey in 1971 .
Yields on benchmark 10 - year U.S. Treasury notes , which influence rates lenders offer to consumers , dropped as low as 2.65 percent this week from 2.99 percent in early February after bearish economic reports .
Forecasts from the Federal Reserve for slower growth added to the negative tone , Frank Nothaft , Freddie Mac ’s chief economist , said in the statement .
“ Mortgage rates followed bond yields lower this week as recent economic reports suggest the economy is still slowing , which reduces the future threat of inflation , ” Nothaft said .
Applications for U.S. home mortgages soared last week , nearing the levels last seen as rates dropped in early January , the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday .
The 30 - year rate as measured by the MBA fell to 4.99 percent in the week ending February 13 .
Mortgage rates averaged the lowest in the northeastern U.S. , at 4.92 percent , according to Freddie Mac ’s survey .
Rates averaged the highest in the southwest , at 5.14 percent , it said .
All rates in the survey are based on up - front payments of about 0.7 percentage point of loan principal to the lenders .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Army is apologizing to thousands of Army families who received letters beginning " Dear John Doe " after losing a loved one in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr. is sending a personal letter to the families who received the letter .
Some 7,000 letters were sent in late December to notify families of services or gifts surviving family members can receive from nonprofit organizations that help families of fallen soldiers , according to an Army statement Wednesday .
The letters also had improper address information at the top of the correspondence .
Instead of the receiving family 's name and home address , the letters said " Army Long Term Case Management . "
The letters were printed by a contracting company and sent by the U.S. Army Human Resources Command 's Casualty and Mortuary Affairs Center in Alexandria , Virginia .
The center issued a formal apology Wednesday , according to the statement .
" There are no words to adequately apologize for this mistake or for the hurt it may have caused , " Brig .
Gen. Reuben D. Jones , Army adjutant general , said in the statement .
" It is important the original intent of the letter is not lost .
The organizations mentioned are dedicated to honoring loved ones and recognizing their sacrifice and commitment , " the apology continued .
Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr. is sending a personal letter to the thousands of families who received the improperly addressed letter , according to Paul Boyce , an Army spokesman .
Merrilee Carlson , president of the veterans and family support group Families United , was told by the Army that families would be receiving one of these improperly addressed letters within the next few days .
" We want to let people know these letters are coming so they are not surprised when they open them , " she said .
Carlson is the mother of Sgt. Michael Carlson , who was killed in Iraq in 2005 .
She said the Army told her she was among those who would receive a letter on Wednesday .
" This was a tragic mistake , but I believe it was not done maliciously , " she said .
" The Army would not do this intentionally to people . "
While there have not been 7,000 soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Army often sends letters to primary and secondary family members .

With the focus on the economic stimulus package shifting to the Senate , the partisan split evident with the Democrat - only passage of the bill in the House last night overshadowed a lot of the discussions on both sides of the aisle today .
So much so that various leaders were practically disowning the word bipartisanship as if deadly germs were part of its etymology .
At a news conference earlier today , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the Democrat - only passage of the economic stimulus package , contending that Republicans were indeed included ; their suggestions on tax cuts had become part of the bill itself , she said .
But several G.O.P. senators and representatives hit the airwaves today , criticizing the spending portions and promoting their view of a more palatable alternative — bigger , broader tax cuts and incentives .
When Mrs. Pelosi was asked whether the vote — 244 to 188 without a single Republican ’s approval — represented a failure on her part to advance President Obama ’s desire for a broad bipartisan bill , she practically snapped :
“ I did n’t come here to be partisan .
I did n’t come here to be bipartisan .
I came here , as did my colleagues , to be nonpartisan , to work for the American people , to do what is in their interest .
The president ’s agenda is reflected in this legislation .
It ’s — I mentioned , some of the priorities that were there about creating jobs , cutting taxes , helping states through this difficult economic time , and to do so in a fiscally sound way .
People vote for what they believe in .
Clearly , the Republicans did not believe in the agenda that I just described for you , and that ’s probably one of the reasons they voted that way .
I think they probably voted their conscience and they could n’t support that .
…
We reached out to the Republicans all along the way , and they know it .
And they know it .
They were part of the original bill , with the — some of the tax provisions were their suggestions .
They had what they asked for in terms of committee mark - up .
They had the rule on the floor that gave them plenty of opportunity to make changes .
They just did n’t have the ideas that had the support of the majority of the people in the Congress . ”
She pushed back strenuously in response to remarks made by Minority Leader John Boehner and other House Republicans , who slammed the bill as “ partisan ” and full of excessive spending rather than the approach of using tax cuts .
They complained that the Democratic leadership acted autocratically , in contrast to Mr. Obama ’s entreaties for work across the aisles .
( And today Republican groups and officials continued to criticize the leadership , with one distributing earlier quotes from Mrs. Pelosi , when she opened this session touting bipartisanship . )
Mr. Boehner , who was attending a retreat with his fellow members , issued another missive today — using bipartisanship in his own way ( because 11 Democrats voted with 177 Republicans against the bill ) :
“ The vote last night sent a clear , powerful , and bipartisan message to Congressional Democratic leaders about the current version of the economic “ stimulus ” package : the American people deserve better .
The current product is n’t good enough . ”
On the Senate side , much remains up in the air in terms of how deep the Republican opposition will be .
For a sampling of those Republicans whose objections are fairly hardline : Senators John Barrasso of Wyoming and Jim DeMint of South Carolina were among those who complained in interviews that the effort was piling up unsustainable debt .
“ The Senate committee that addresses this has produced a bill and we ’ll start talking about it next week , ” Senator DeMint said in an interview today on Fox News .
“ It ’s very much like the House bill .
They rejected every Republican amendment .
So this idea of bipartisanship is a bunch of rhetoric .
There is no bipartisanship on this massive spending bill , but I think it is going to help define the Republicans and the Democrats once again because every Republican in the House rejected this and I think every Republican in the Senate might do as well . ”
In a separate interview with Fox later today , Senator Richard Burr , Republican of North Carolina , said he doubted he could vote for the measure unless it was drastically altered .
“ Well , I think there ’ll be quite a few senators that choose to vote against this .
Anything short of a major change in the
bill which would include a reduction in the amount of spending — you know , in about 45 days from the TARP to the Omnibus Appropriations Bill , this Congress will spend $ 2 trillion of taxpayer money .
I ’m not sure that my children will even be able to retire the debt on that deficit for their lifetime . ”
At a Democratic leadership briefing this afternoon , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid seemed to be trying to head off a divide as severe as the one in the House , for starters by asking for “ partisan bickering ” to be put aside .
While vowing to get a bill to Mr. Obama ’s desk before any recess would begin , Mr. Reid promised to continue the resumption of an amendment process that has allowed Republicans to make real proposals on the floor , for the first time in a few years .
“ Until that ’s abused , we ’re going to continue it , ” he said .
Mr. Reid began by drawing a comparison between the size of the stadium for the Super Bowl game ( seating in Tampa at 75,000 ) to a layoff number of 85,000 from a total just the other day , to get a picture going .
Senator Dick Durbin , noting the layoff number for this month alone is about 212,000 , called that figure a “ grim reminder of what this debate is about . ”
“ For those Republicans who voted against it , their alternative is what ? ” Mr. Durbin asked sharply .
“ We ca n’t stand back and do nothing . ”
And Senator Chuck Schumer , Democrat of New York , went one further , invoking Mr. Boehner by name and saying he “ is leading his members off a cliff . … I hope Senate Republicans make a strong break with their House colleagues . ”
As for the G.O.P. labeling Mrs. Pelosi ’s leadership a “ failure ” because of the House vote , Mr. Schumer expressed disbelief .
“ The failure will be not to do a bill , ” Mr. Reid said later .
A few points underlining the way the Senate leaders may be leaning :
Disposable Programs Faced with criticisms about some individual items in the House bill that drew fire , Mr. Reid said : “ Let ’s understand this is a very large package . …
Is everything we have in this perfect ?
Of course not , and that ’s why we ’ll have a bill that ’s different from the House . ”
Dealing with philosophical differences as to what will indeed create jobs , Mr. Reid quipped : “ Stimulus is in the eye of the beholder , O.K ? ”
( As an aside , Mrs. Pelosi corrected a reporter who said Mr. Obama had indicated the Senate version would “ improve ” on the House bill : “ Strengthen , ” she admonished . )
More Housing Help Some — including Senator Chris Dodd — are questioning whether there should n’t be additional assistance in the stimulus package to ease the mortgage crisis .
Mr. Reid seemed to indicate that more help might fall outside this particular bill .
( Senator Dodd also wants to see — in or out of the stimulus bill — a 90 - day moratorium on housing foreclosures . )
Tax Cuts Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , in an interview with CNBC today , indicated that he believed the Senate bill — and perhaps the final compromise — would include more on the “ tax side ” of things , though he stopped short of giving an emphatic answer to a specific query on “ tax cuts . ”
He also said he thought there might be additions on the infrastructure portion as well , and predicted that some Republican senators would vote for it .
Alternative Minimum Tax Changes
One provision that would adjust the AMT to keep down income taxes for some middle - class Americans this year , will be taken care of , whether it ’s in the stimulus bill or not , Mr. Reid said .
It is , however , favored by many Republican senators , as it amounts to about $ 75 billion in tax relief .
River Severn Project Could Power 5 % of UK Homes
January 27th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Water rises and falls up to 12 yards , twice a day in the Severn Estuary .
That ’s a lot of potential tidal power going to waste , and the UK knows it .
Yesterday , the government announced 5 potential schemes to harness the Severn ’s plentiful energy .
The proposals are as follows : the Bridgewater - Bay lagoon ( impounds a section of coastal estuary to generate 1.36GW ) , the Fleming lagoon ( a similar scheme on the Welsh shore ) , the Cardiff - Weston barrage ( ten- mile stretch of land that could generate up to 5 % of the UK ’s energy needs ) , the Shoots barrage ( upstream scheme that could generate 1GW ) , and the Beachley barrage ( scheme above the Wye River that could generate 625 MW ) .
The lagoons would be built from stone , rubble , and 9 ft. high sausage - shaped bags filled with silt .
The bags would create a 12 yard high lagoon wall .
Each lagoon would theoretically fill with water twice a day , and power would be generated when water flowing out of the lagoons drives electricity - generating turbines .
According to project developers , a prototype lagoon could be built by 2012 .
All of the proposed schemes have received environmentalist approval , with the exception of the Cardiff - Weston Barrage .
The controversial dam would destroy thousands of acres of mudflats and salt marshes .
The UK government will pick a project by 2010 after a 2 - year feasibility study looking into the costs , impact , and benefits of each scheme .

Dear CSA members and supporters ,
Canadians for Safe Access was formed in 2003 as the first medical cannabis patient ’s rights group in Canada in order to provide a strong , unified voice for Canadian medical cannabis patients , and their friends , families , and supporters .
Over the years we ’ve worked hard to inform the public , press and policy - makers about the potential benefits of medical cannabis , to advocate for access to a supply of high quality and affordable cannabis , and to ensure that the rights of patients who could benefit from its use were respected and reflected in Health Canada ’s medical cannabis regulations .
Other patient - centered organizations have come to the fore to take on the tasks that CSA assumed so many years ago , bringing new ideas and energy to the medical cannabis patients rights ’ movement .
There are also some other longstanding organizations that have been advocating for patients over the years .
We are strongly supportive of many of these organizations , and would now like to figuratively pass the CSA mantle on to them .
We will leave the CSA website up as an information resource for patients and a historic resource for interested public and academics , however patient queries , membership applications , and media requests should now be directed to these groups .
These groups include :
Canadians for Fair Access to Medical Marijuana .
This organization has been successfully representing medical cannabis patients since 2014 , with a focus on private and public insurance coverage
Maritimers Unite for Medical Marijuana Society
Canadian Medical Cannabis Partners Society
As the co-founders of CSA , we ’d like to thank everyone who has supported the CSA over these many years – the patients and organizations who joined this important cause , the politicians who pressed for positive changes in legislation , co-founder Alison Myrden , and Deb Harper and Matt Elrod who kept the site running and relevant for so many years .
With much appreciation ,

Flying Over Afghanistan at 150MPH and 25 Feet off the Ground
A poor understanding of probability leads many people to put forward supernatural explanation for events that are far more common than they think .
This video shows how probability theory is sufficient to explain even seemingly remarkable coincidences .
It seems that back when the Prisoner 's Dilemma was still being worked out , Merrill Flood and Melvin Drescher tried a 100 - fold iterative PD on two smart but unprepared subjects , Armen Alchian of UCLA and John D. Williams of RAND .
The kicker being that the payoff matrix was asymmetrical , with dual cooperation awarding JW twice as many points as AA :
( AA , JW ) JW : D JW : C AA : D ( 0 , 0.5 ) ( 1 , -1 ) AA : C ( - 1 , 2 ) ( 0.5 , 1 )
The resulting 100 iterations , with a log of comments written by both players , make for fascinating reading .
JW spots the possibilities of cooperation right away , while AA is slower to catch on .
But once AA does catch on to the possibilities of cooperation , AA goes on throwing in an occasional D... because AA thinks the natural meeting point for cooperation is a fair outcome , where both players get around the same number of total points .
JW goes on trying to enforce ( C , C ) - the option that maximizes total utility for both players - by punishing AA 's attempts at defection .
JW 's log shows comments like " He 's crazy .
I 'll teach him the hard way . "
Meanwhile , AA 's log shows comments such as " He wo n't share .
He 'll punish me for trying ! "
I confess that my own sympathies lie with JW , and I do n't think I would have played AA 's game in AA 's shoes .
This would seem to indicate that I 'm more of a utilitarian than a fair - i- tarian .
Life does n't always hand you fair games , and the best we can do for each other is play them positive - sum .
Though I might have been somewhat more sympathetic to AA , if the ( C , C ) outcome had actually lost him points , and only ( D , C ) had made it possible for him to gain them back .
For example , this is also a Prisoner 's Dilemma :
( AA , JW ) JW : D JW : C AA : D ( - 2 , 2 ) ( 2 , 0 ) AA : C ( - 5 , 6 ) ( - 1 , 4 )
Theoretically , of course , utility functions are invariant up to affine transformation , so a utility 's absolute sign is not meaningful .
But this is not always a good metaphor for real life .
Of course what we want in this case , societally speaking , is for JW to slip AA a bribe under the table .
That way we can maximize social utility while letting AA go on making a profit .
But if AA starts out with a negative number in ( C , C ) , how much do we want AA to demand in bribes - from our global , societal perspective ?
The whole affair makes for an interesting reminder of the different worldviews that people invent for themselves - seeming so natural and uniquely obvious from the inside - to make themselves the heroes of their own stories .
The kitchen is a sanctuary , a place to prepare a satisfying meal and enjoy it after a tough day of work or school .
Accordingly , many people put great effort into making their kitchen look appealing and comfortable .
But what about energy efficiency ?
Left unchecked , kitchens have the potential to become energy hogs that sabotage our efforts to be green elsewhere in life !
Here are 8 ways to right ship and transform any kitchen into a green kitchen .
Solar ovens
( Images via SolarCooking , Ethicurean , )
For those truly committed to green cooking , solar ovens offer a fun and interesting alternative to conventional gas or electric models .
Many foods can be safely and properly heated using little more than an oven similar those pictured above and natural , free - as - air light from the sun .
Those interested can either buy a ready - made model ( first image ) or construct one of their own ( second image . )
Aluminum can crusher
( Image via GadgetGrid )
It ’s not 1995 anymore – everyone knows it ’s a good idea to recycle .
The problem is that it ’s not always easy or convenient !
Who really wants to lug a bag full of aluminum cans out to the recycling bin ( especially during the cold winter months ? )
No one .
Luckily , this aluminum can crusher makes the task much less daunting !
Simply crush all empty cans and store them until enough have accumulated for a single trip out to the bin .
Owl energy monitor
( Image via SmarterProducts )
The Owl electricity monitor is the perfect kitchen gadget for getting real - time information on your home ’s overall energy use .
Sit this baby on the counter and you ’ll know , every time a light or appliance is turned on anywhere in the house , how much electricity you are using , how much money it is costing you , and how much CO2 your home is emitting .
Water - powered clock

Digital clocks are n’t exactly the biggest energy hogs in one ’s kitchen , but every little bit counts !
So unplug that old clunker next to the toaster in favor of this clock , whose electrodes use a combination of water and salt to display the time .
In fact , you can refill it while you ’re refilling the next green kitchen gadget .
The eco-kettle
( Image via Gizoo )
Who could start their morning without a hot , fresh cup of tea ?
Indeed , no kitchen is complete without a tea kettle .
Sadly , many of us are boiling much more water than we really need , wasting significant amounts energy each morning .
But no longer !
Enter the eco-kettle , which boils just enough water for your choice of 1 - 8 cups of tea .
Best of all , it ’s quick – just 35 seconds to boil a single cup !
The eco-cooker
( Image via Today ’s Gizmos )
Great as it would be to use solar ovens for all cooking , what would one do during bad weather or gloomy skies ?
When it ’s conventional stove top cooking or bust , the eco cooker is the optimal choice .
Rather than using two or three pots ( and electricity from two or three burners ) to boil two or three separate foods , the eco cooker can boil them all at the same time .
Faucet aerators

Described by EarthEasy.com as “ the single most effective water conservation savings you can do for your home ” , low - flow aerators belong on the faucets of every kitchen .
They can reduce a home ’s overall water consumption by up to 50 % , helping your wallet and the environment all at the same time .
Best of all , low - flow aerators are extremely inexpensive and available at virtually any hardware store .
Bamboo bowls

Finally , a kitchen is only as green as the bowls the food is served in .
Produced by the green kitchenware maker Bambu , the bowls shown above were hand - crafted and coiled using 100 % organically grown bamboo .
These bowls and other green kitchenware can be purchased at the Bambu website .
The report was the first in - depth federal look at the prevalence of stalking , which is a crime in all 50 states .
While many people tend to associate stalking with the pursuit of stars like Uma Thurman and David Letterman , researchers found that 3.4 million people were subjected to stalking , defined as a course of conduct that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear .
Women were more often the victims than men .
And 11 percent , about 374,000 people , had been stalked for five or more years .
And then there were those like Cameron Wallace of New Franklin , Ohio , who endured the terrifying experience far longer .
Ms. Wallace , now 28 , was in her sophomore year of high school in 1996 when she sat next to Ryan Clutter in art class .
Although they never dated or were even friends , he began turning up just about everywhere she went .
For the next 11 years , he appeared at her house or at the mall , sat behind her at the movies , sent demands by e-mail and threatened her life .
He described how he would kill her : “ He was going to gut me , ” she said in an interview this month , still tearful .
Yet , she said , the police told her that it was hard to “ connect all his actions ” and that he had denied them .
“ They could not act until he did something more serious , ” Ms. Wallace said .
Three - quarters of victims know their stalker , whether it is a current or former friend , roommate or neighbor , this study and others have found .
“ Often stalkers want to make their victims fearful , ” said Eugene A. Rugala , a former F.B.I. profiler who advises on workplace threats .
“ They are thinking , ‘ How dare you do this to me ?
I ’m going to make you pay . ’
But others feel it could be a way of getting back into the relationship . ”

Rückschlag für Leroy Sané ! Der
Neuzugang des FC Bayern wird den Showdown mit Borussia Dortmund ( FC Bayern - BVB , ab 20:30 Uhr im LIVETICKER ) verletzungsbedingt verpassen .
Das erklärte Trainer Hansi Flick auf der abschließenden Pressekonferenz vor dem Duell mit dem BVB .
Sané habe eine Kapselverletzung im Knie erlitten .
" Wir hoffen , dass er uns nach der Länderspielpause wieder zur Verfügung steht " , erklärte Flick .
Zudem ist ein Einsatz von Abwehrchef David Alaba wegen muskulärer Probleme fraglich .
Kreuzbandriss verhinderte Sané- WechselSané hatte sich im August 2019 das Kreuzband im rechten Knie gerissen , wodurch er knapp sieben Monate ausfiel und erst in diesem Sommer an die Säbener Straße wechseln konnte .
Knapp 45 Millionen Euro überwiesen die Münchner für ihren Königstransfer an Manchester City .
Auch weil Kingsley Coman den Münchner in dieser Saison in den ersten beiden Partien noch nicht zur Verfügung stand ( Quarantäne nach Corona - Fall im Umfeld ) , stand der 24 Jahre alte Sané bislang in allen drei Pflichtspielen des FC Bayern von Beginn an auf dem Platz .
Beim 8:0 - Erfolg gegen den FC Schalke 04 am ersten Spieltag gelang ihm neben zwei Assists auch sein erster Treffer für den neuen Klub .
Stem cells have come to represent an almost magical transformation of medicine .
It is hoped that they will be able to mend broken bones , fix damaged hearts , repair severed spinal cords , rejuvenate aged brains or generally treat any of the vital organs of an ailing patient .
But what is the reality of these mysterious cells , which can transform themselves into any of the 200 specialised tissues of the human body ?
Last month , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) gave the go - ahead for the first clinical trial of human embryonic stem cells on paralysed patients with spinal cord injuries .
Geron , a Californian biotechnology company , has been licensed to use a line of stem cells isolated from human embryos left over from IVF treatment .
Stem cells are often described as the " master cells " of the body .
But is probably more accurate to call them the " mothers " of all cells .
A stem cell divides into two daughter cells and it is this process of cell division , from mother to daughter , that eventually turns a stem cell into one of the many specialist cells of the body – whether it is an insulin - producing cell in the pancreas , or a nerve cell in the brain .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The vital point about a stem cell is that it has a potency that other cells do not possess .
But not all stem cells have the same power .
The greatest of all stem cells is the zygote , or fertilised egg .
This single cell has the power of creating every single cell of the body .
The next level of potency is possessed by stem cells derived from early embryos – a few days after fertilisation .
These embryonic stem cells are able to form all of the body 's cell lineages , including the germ cells that give rise to sperm and eggs .
However , these cells on their own , and without any intervention , do not normally give rise to a complete person , which is why their potency is somewhat more limited .
Further down the hierarchy of power comes " multipotency " .
This is when a stem cell can form multiple lineages of cells that constitute an entire tissue or set of related tissues .
A good example of this type of potency is the stem cells that come from a person 's bone marrow .
These stem cells give rise to some of the many different cells of the blood and the immune system .
Another example is the stem cells found in the blood of the umbilical cord and placenta .
Like bone marrow stem cells , cord blood stem cells can also differentiate into different specialised cells of the blood and immune system .
The embryonic stem cell , which develops a few days after the fertilised egg begins to divide , is the stem cell that holds the most promise as the ultimate " repair kit " for the human body .
The aim , eventually , is to be able to make embryonic stem cells from a patient 's own skin in order to transplant them back into the body and fix whatever has been damaged .
Scientists all over the world are engaged in the race to develop stem cell therapies .
Around the world :
The stem cell map
A first for primate cloning : Beaverton , Oregon
Shoukhrat Mitalipov , a Russian - born scientist working at the Oregon National Primate Research Centre , used the Dolly technique to clone primate embryos from the skin cells of a 10 - year - old rhesus macaque monkey called Semos .
They were the first primate embryos to be cloned in this way .
He also extracted embryonic stem cells from some of the cloned embryos and managed to get some of these embryonic cells to develop in the laboratory into mature heart cells and brain neurons , according to a study published at the end of 2007 .
Dolly the sheep : Roslin , Edinburgh , Scotland :
A team led by Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh announced in 1996 the birth of Dolly the sheep , who was cloned from the frozen udder cells of a six - year - old ewe .
Dolly was the first authenticated clone of an adult mammal and her birth marked a milestone in the possible derivation of embryonic stem cells from adult mammals , such as man .
The implications for medicine are immense – in that it raised the possibility of making a " repair kit " of embryonic stem cells from a patient 's own skin cells in order to mend damaged tissues in the brain , heart , pancreas or virtually any other part of an ailing body .
Man meets cow : Newcastle , England
Alison Murdoch of Newcastle University 's Centre for Life announced , in May 2005 , the creation of human blastocyst embryos produced by a modified version of the Dolly cloning technique , where the nuclei of embryonic stem cells are inserted into human eggs with their own nuclei removed .
However , Murdoch 's colleague , Miodrag Stojkovic , subsequently severed ties with her , claiming that the work was announced prematurely and without due credit .
He left Newcastle to lead the Prince Felipe Research Centre in Valencia , Spain in 2006 .
Since then , Newcastle 's stem cell work has been led by Lyle Armstrong , who has produced 278 cloned " hybrid " embryos created by the fusion of human cells with cow eggs .
However , he has been unable to extract embryonic stem cells from hybrid embryos and has run out of funding .
Human embryos and controversy : Seoul , South Korea
Cloning expert Woo Suk Hwang of Seoul National University in South Korea announced in February 2004 the world 's first successful clones of human embryos in a study published in the journal ' Science ' .
Wang used the Dolly technique to transfer cell nuclei from skin cells into human eggs that had their own DNA removed .
In May 2005 , they announced a streamlined process that used far fewer human eggs and in November 2005 they announced the establishment of 11 " lines " of embryonic stem cell from cloned human embryos .
However , over the next few months the studies were retracted , Wang admitted scientific fraud and was forced to resign in disgrace .
Skin genes reprogrammed : Kyoto , Japan
Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University is the first to change the face of embryonic stem cell research using a pioneering approach called " direct reprogramming " , which involves altering a handful of genes in an adult skin cell so that it reverts to an embryonic - like state without the need for eggs or embryos .
In 1996 , Yamanaka showed that the approach , called induced pluripotent stem ( IPS ) cells , works on mice cells and in 2007 he demonstrated that it could also be done successfully on human cells .
A separate study by James Thomson 's group in Wisconsin came to the same conclusion .
The mouse stem cells breakthrough : San Francisco , California
Two groups working independently , led by Gail Martin of the University of California , San Francisco , and Martin Evans of the University of Cambridge , isolated embryonic stem cells for the first time from laboratory mice in pioneering studies published in 1981 .
Professor Evans went on to lay the foundation for much of the later work on human embryonic stem cells .
Crucially , he showed that mouse embryonic stem cells could give rise to all cells of the body , including the germ cells that produce sperm and eggs , a breakthrough that won him a share of the 2007 Nobel prize for medicine .
Advance for spinal injuries ?
Madison , Wisconsin and Menlo Park , California
James Thomson of the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Centre is the first to extract embryonic stem cells from primates – rhesus macaque monkeys – in a study published in 1995 .
In November 1998 , he was the first to isolate human embryonic stem cells from human embryos left over from IVF treatment .
Patents for the Wisconsin stem cells are granted the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the technology is commercialised by biotechnology company Geron of Menlo Park , California .
In January 2009 , Geron is granted a licence by the FDA to begin clinical trials on spinal cord patients .
A false start : Worcester , Massachusetts
The Massachusetts laboratory facility of the company Advanced Cell Technology announced in 2001 that it had cloned a human embryo with the aim of producing bespoke human embryonic stem cells for patients .
However , the evidence proved controversial and was not conclusive .
The three - day - old embryo did not develop past the stage of a few cells .
The company was also the first to experiment with " hybrid " embryos , by fusing human cells with cow eggs .
In 2006 , the company announced another technique for deriving embryonic stem cells from an embryo that does not destroythat embryo .
The landmark trachea transplant : Barcelona , Spain
In 2008 , a 30 - year - old woman became the first patient to receive a bio-engineered windpipe – the trachea – grown from her own stem cells .
Tuberculosis destroyed the windpipe of Claudia Castillo , so scientists from Barcelona 's Hospital Clinic , working with colleagues from Bristol University , took stem cells from her bone marrow and from within the inside of her nose to make cartilage and epithelial tissue to reconstruct the organ , which they successfully transplanted into the patient .
Castillo can now walk up stairs and play with her children – activities that were impossible for her before the pioneering operation .
Rabbit fusion : Shanghai , China
In 2003 , a team of scientists led by Hui Zhen Sheng of the Shanghai Second Medical University published a study showing that it is possible to fuse human cells with the enucleated egg cells of animals – in this case the rabbit – to produce embryonic stem cells .
Sheng effectively used a version of the Dolly cloning technique of cell nuclear transfer and bypassed the problem of a shortage of human eggs by using rabbit eggs that had their own nuclei removed .
She was able to report the isolation of embryonic stem cells from these hybrid cloned embryos derived from the skin cells of four people aged five , 42 , 52 and 60 .
She also reported being able to grow these stem cells into muscle and nerve cells .
However , other scientists have yet to replicate the work .
Asia 's stem cell bank : Singapore
The city state has attracted many stem cell researchers from around the world with its liberal laws on embryonic stem cells and human embryo cloning , as well as generous research funding .
American scientists , dogged by restrictions on US federal funding of embryonic stem cell research and British scientists , complaining of poor funding in the UK , have been enticed to work in the city , which has built up a sizeable stem cell bank at Biopolis , a seven - building biomedical " hive " of activity , and gleaming centrepiece of Singapore 's biotechnology industry .
NEW YORK / LAS VEGAS ( Reuters ) - Verizon Communications
Inc has chosen Microsoft Corp to provide Internet search services for cell phones , in what is seen as a blow to rivals Google Inc and Yahoo Inc .
A customer stands outside of a Verizon Wireless store waiting to purchase the new Blackberry Storm phone in New York , November 21 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid
Verizon Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg said on Wednesday that Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer would announce the deal later in the day at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas .
Seidenberg , speaking at a Citigroup conference , gave no further details .
The agreement follows more than a year of speculation on whom would become the default mobile search provider for Verizon Wireless , which is set to surpass AT&T Inc as the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier after it closes its purchase of smaller operator Alltel later this week .
“ It ’s certainly a feather in Microsoft ’s cap .
Tough news for Google and tougher news for Yahoo , ” CCS Insight analyst John Jackson said of the agreement .
Microsoft made a bid for Yahoo last year , but walked away after they disagreed on price .
Investors have been skeptical about whether the software company can win online advertising revenue away from Google and Yahoo , which are both stronger than Microsoft in the Internet search market .
“ Microsoft really needed to win that , ” Nielsen ’s head of telecom research , Roger Entner , said about the Verizon deal .
“ It gives them a good fighting chance .
Otherwise they would have been almost insurmountably behind Google ” in mobile search .
However , the deal was not likely to change how many Verizon Wireless customers use their phones to surf the Web , Jackson said .
While the details of the agreement have yet to be revealed , he said Google may have been a better choice to help Verizon offer personalized Web services , such as delivering ads that are relevant to users ’ interests .
“ The ultimate goal in mobility is contextual awareness and the delivery of highly personalized experiences , ” Jackson said .
“ These are competencies Google has in spades , so it may be that Verizon ’s customers ultimately end up with an inferior experience relative to what Google might enable . ”
Last year ,
The Wall Street Journal reported the two companies were in negotiations and that Microsoft would share with Verizon revenue from advertisements shown in response to cell phone Web searches .
Other previous reports had said Verizon was exploring a deal with Google .
Verizon shares rose 1.27 percent to $ 31.90 in on the New York Stock Exchange .
Amid a broad tech slump following a revenue warning from bellwether Intel Corp , Microsoft shares fell 6.02 percent to $ 19.51 on the Nasdaq , where Google shares fell 3.61 percent to $ 322.01 and Yahoo shares fell 2.23 percent to $ 12.71 .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Flitting across your yard , butterflies seem friendly and harmless .
But at least one type has learned to raise its young as parasites , tricking ants into feeding it and giving special treatment .
The pupae of the European butterfly Maculina rebeli exude a scent that mimics the ants and make themselves at home inside the ant nest .
Once they become a caterpillar they even beg for food like ant larvae , researchers report in Friday 's edition of the journal Science .
But , not content just to be fed , the butterflies even manage to demand special treatment , Jeremy A. Thomas of Britain 's University of Oxford and colleagues report .
It turns out that ant queens make subtle sounds that signal their special status to worker ants .
The caterpillars have learned to mimic those sounds , the researchers say , earning high enough status to be rescued before others if the nest is disturbed .
In times of food shortage , nurse ants have been known to kill their own larvae and feed them to the caterpillars pretending to be queen ants , they added .
In nature , the real ant queen and the caterpillar keep to different parts of the ant colony and would not encounter one another , the report said .
But in an experiment , a butterfly pupa pretending to be an ant queen was placed in a chamber with worker ants and four real ant queens .
The ant queens began to attack and bite the caterpillar , but the workers intervened , biting and stinging their own queens , which they then pulled to a far corner of the chamber while other workers attended the pupa .

David Blankenhorn and Jonathan Rauch , who come from totally opposite sides of the same - sex marriage debate , offer this compromise in a New York Times Op - Ed this morning :
It would work like this : Congress would bestow the status of federal civil unions on same - sex marriages and civil unions granted at the state level , thereby conferring upon them most or all of the federal benefits and rights of marriage .
But there would be a condition : Washington would recognize only those unions licensed in states with robust religious - conscience exceptions , which provide that religious organizations need not recognize same - sex unions against their will .
The federal government would also enact religious - conscience protections of its own .
All of these changes would be enacted in the same bill .
(…)
Linking federal civil unions to guarantees of religious freedom seems a natural way to give the two sides something they would greatly value while heading off a long - term , take - no - prisoners conflict .
That should appeal to cooler heads on both sides , and it also ought to appeal to President Obama , who opposes same - sex marriage but has endorsed federal civil unions .
A successful template already exists : laws that protect religious conscience in matters pertaining to abortion .
These statutes allow Catholic hospitals to refuse to provide abortions , for example .
If religious exemptions can be made to work for as vexed a moral issue as abortion , same - sex marriage should be manageable , once reasonable people of good will put their heads together .
The first problem with this proposal seems to be rather self evident to me .
Namely , where in Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution is Congress granted the power to regulate marriage ?
Some might argue that Section 5 of the 14th Amendment creates such a power to the extent that marriage is a “ privilege or immunity ” contemplated by Section 1 of that Amendment , or that depriving homosexuals of the rights and benefits of civil marriage constitutes a deprivation of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; or that it denies them equal protection of the laws .
However , that argument would run head - on into the fact that there ’s little evidence that the framers of the 14th Amendment intended it to be such complete a usurpation of state ’s rights as this argument would contemplate .
Moreover , such an interpretation of the 14th Amendment would effective mean that the 10th Amendment had been repealed by it ’s ratification ; and there ’s no evidence that was the intention back in 1865 .
So , at the very least , we ’ve got a significant federalism problem that should n’t be dismissed .
A second problem with this proposal is that it continues with the idea of creating two separate statuses .
What , exactly , would be the difference between marriage and these civil unions ?
Unless the differences are in name only , then we ’re not talking about real equality .
Would heterosexual couples be able to enter into these civil unions instead of marriages ?
If not , then you really are creating two different classes of people .
And , finally , what would be the rules regarding dissolution of a civil union ?
Would it be easier ?
Harder ?
Would traditional domestic relations law apply ?
If the only difference between “ marriage ” and “ civil union ” is the name , then what ’s the point of having two different institutions ?
A final problem with this proposal is that it raises what is clearly a straw man in this whole debate .
Except in the mind of the truly wacko , the idea that same - sex marriage poses any serious threat to religious liberty .
Modern marriage is a civil institution governed by the state , so long as that is the case then the state has no right to discriminate against people when it decides who is and is not entitled to claim the benefits of that relationship .
Churches , on the other hand , are free under the First Amendment to confer their religious marriages under any circumstances they deem fit .
The problem , of course , is that marriage today is still a hybrid institution .
Is it a civil relationship governed by the state , or a religious one governed by the laws of whatever deity ( ies ) you happen to worship , or , is it a combination of both ?
The solution , as I ’ve mentioned before , seems rather obvious :
If that ’s what you believe a marriage is , the union of a man and woman before God and man , then what does the state have to do with so fundamentally a religious institution ?
Why does the state need to recognize it at all and why does it need to grant that religious institution preferntial benefits in the form of tax breaks and a protected legal status that is not available to unmarried persons ?
Kellie and I were married in the Roman Catholic Church , which has requirements for marriage that exceed , and are different from , those of civil marriage .
That wedding ceremony is what made the marriage official in the eyes of God , not the little piece of paper we got from Cuyahoga County , Ohio the day before .
Here ’s my proposal .
Get rid of civil marriage licenses entirely .
Let people decide for themselves what they believe about marriage and let them , if they wish solemnize that union in a church of their choice .
We are hundreds of years past the day where the state was involved in religious affairs , it does n’t need to be involved in this matter either .
It ’s really not as radical an idea as you might think .
Contrary to what some of the “ traditional marriage ” advocates would have you think , state involvement in marriage is a relatively recent thing historically :
For 16 centuries , Christianity also defined the validity of a marriage on the basis of a couple ’s wishes .
If two people claimed they had exchanged marital vows — even out alone by the haystack — the Catholic Church accepted that they were validly married .
In 1215 , the church decreed that a “ licit ” marriage must take place in church .
But people who married illictly had the same rights and obligations as a couple married in church : their children were legitimate ; the wife had the same inheritance rights ; the couple was subject to the same prohibitions against divorce .
Not until the 16th century did European states begin to require that marriages be performed under legal auspices .
In part , this was an attempt to prevent unions between young adults whose parents opposed their match .
That practice carried over to the American colonies and , later , the United States , where marriage licensing laws quickly became a way to prevent socially disapproved inter-racial marriages and to limit the rights of women :
By the 1920s , 38 states prohibited whites from marrying blacks , “ mulattos , ” Japanese , Chinese , Indians , “ Mongolians , ” “ Malays ” or Filipinos .
Twelve states would not issue a marriage license if one partner was a drunk , an addict or a “ mental defect . ”
Eighteen states set barriers to remarriage after divorce .
So , the idea that the marriage must be something defined by the state is n’t as historically grounded as some would have you think .
And what about the supposed threat to religious liberty if homosexuals were allow to declare themselves married ?
Well , it ai n’t there :
[ N] obody is saying that your church has to approve or consecrate same - sex unions .
Heck , you could have a religion that said people with different hair colors ca n’t get married if you wanted to , just do n’t make it the business of the state to codify your religious prejudices .
Exactly .
Blankehorn and Rauch make a good effort at trying to find some middle ground on this issue .
And that alone I take as a sign that the rigid opposition to same - sex unions that we ’ve seen in the past is melting away far quicker than anyone anticipated ( just look at Utah for more proof of that assertion ) .
As a practical , Constitutional solution to the problem , though , I ’m afraid they ’ve fallen short .

Do you really think their trust in your station will crumble if they listen to some critical comments about the television news industry ?
If so , I would suggest strongly that the foundation upon which your station is built is a weak one .
The issue is far bigger than our book .
Government censorship is not nearly as bad as is corporate censorship -- especially by a company that serves the public --- or ought to .
You also show contempt toward Ms. Wahl by your actions .
The public will learn -- it always does remember -- of such actions and when it does , I hope you will have ready a far better excuse than not being interested in a book critical of " what we do as a business . "

This coming August I 'll have been a Life member of the National Rifle Association 22 years .
If you 're not a member yourself , it may surprise you to learn that , by the standards of that organization , born just after the War between the States , this is n't particularly long .
I know people who 've been in the NRA twice as long as I have , and one or two who 've been members three times that number of years .
It is long enough , however , to make me wonder , as one does upon occasion in any long - term relationship , whether , knowing everything I know today , after 22 years , I 'd do it again .
Lately , the answer seems to be and I 'm sure the NRA will be devastated to learn this that I 'd have to think about it .
Knowing everything I know today , I 'd want assurances this time that the NRA is willing and able to perform the task that brought me to it .
I 'd been in Junior NRA as a Scout , but the course of my life had taken me away from shooting ( it seems hard to believe now ) until just before that surrealistic year of 1968 when , as a newly - fledged handgun owner ( we 'd had an incident in the neighborhood ) I recall sitting in front of the TV watching the assassination of Bobby Kennedy , knowing the proclivity of liberals to blame everyone but the perpetrator , and thinking , " Boy , we 're gonna get it now . "
And so we did .
And so I joined the NRA , although it took me five more years to get the cash together for Life membership .
Since then , we 've lost one fight after another until today , the enfringements we deal with on an unalienable individual , civil , Constitutional , and human right that was supposed to be absolutely guaranteed are beyond anything most members of the NRA 22 years ago would have believed .
I was one of a few who saw the ugly future ahead , even then .
Four years after I became a Life member , I wrote my first science fiction novel , full of dire predictions .
I also wrote letters , not just to politicans , but to editors of gun magazines , even to the NRA 's top banana , the guy who looked so much like Nikita Khrushchev , urging them to stop fighting the Battle of the Second Amendment as a holding action , a tactic we have seen was bound for inevitable defeat , and adopt an offensive strategy .
Those editors ( with a remarkable exception whose good judgement I 'll repay by NOT associating his name with mine ) laughed me off as an alarmist .
I never heard from the bald guy at the NRA .
And why should I ?
Who was I ?
Just some nobody , worried over what was about to happen to his unalienable individual , civil , Constitutional , and human rights .
For that matter , who am I today ?
Just a 22 - year Life member wondering whether he'd do it all over again , remember ?
As I say , I 'd want assurances this time , sort of a prenuptial agreement , before I slipped the metaphorical ring on my trigger finger .
My 22 years of experience have taught me a few things a dozen of them , roughly about defending the Second Amendment .
For the life of me , I do n't understand why they have n't taught the same things to the NRA .
FIRST , I 'd want the NRA not to write any more legislation .
It 's said the NRA leadership wrote the Gun Control Act of 1968 ( before my time , if you 'll recall ) .
I know they wrote the Maryland Handgun Ban because they were afraid that something worse was in the works .
Fear seems to be their principal motivation , not anger or determination .
Invariably it steers them toward a submissive , repulsive " strategy " of doing the enemy 's work before he can do it himself .
SECOND , I 'd want the NRA not to trade away any more rights it " thinks " are less important for those it " thinks " are more so .
The leadership would find , if they ever asked , that their membership often disagrees with them .
The " cop - killer " bullet fiasco comes to mind , where we got trivial reforms in a devil 's bargain letting them make some bullets illegal that serves our enemies so well today that one particularly repellant and evil Senator has based the sunset of his career on it .
THIRD , I 'd want the NRA to stop supporting government activities irrelevant , even harmful , to the Second Amendment .
Increasingly , gun owners see that the War on Drugs , to name an example , was meant from the outset as a calculated assault on the Bill of Rights , especially on the Second Amendment .
It must end if there 's to be anything left of the Constitution in the 21st century .
That is n't the NRA 's job , but it should butt out of the debate .
Its " Operation Crimestrike " , celebrating patently illegal incursions against individual rights is nothing more than a sustained , humiliating grovel like having to watch another kind of civil rights advocacy crawl up on the verandah and whine , " See Massah , what a good boy Ah is ? "
FOURTH , in the same context , I 'd want the NRA to disconnect all future discussion of the Second Amendment from the totally unrelated topic of crime .
My rights have nothing whatever to do with anything anybody else does , right or wrong .
If the crime rate were only 1/10 that of today , my rights would be unaffected .
Likewise , if the rate were TEN TIMES what it is , it would have nothing whatever to do with my individual right to own and carry weapons .
FIFTH , I 'd want the NRA to reject all future argument about the " sporting use " of weapons why look like an imbecile , pushing the AK - 47 as a deer rifle , when it meets the Founding Fathers ' ACTUAL criteria so elegantly ?in favor of frank and frequent public reference to the original Constitutional purpose for an armed citizenry , which is to intimidate the government .
SIXTH and this may be the most important point I 'll make , so pay attention I 'd want the NRA to adopt as its principal and publicly - acknowledged objective the repeal or nullification of every weapons law , at every level of government in America .
The Second Amendment is explicit about this and requires no esoteric legal interpretation .
Check the dictionary meaning of " enfringe " if you doubt my word .
SEVENTH , in support of that objective , I 'd want the NRA to print ads , half a page in every issue , in all its periodicals , reminding members of the duty and power of an American jury to nullify any law it believes unjust or unconstitutional .
Alcohol prohibition died this way .
Gun prohibition could , as well .
All it takes is eight and a third percent of the population , one twelfth , to carry it off .
EIGHTH , I 'd want the NRA to establish programs to educate the police in their absolute obligation ( given the Nuremburg trials after World War II ) to enforce only those statutes and obey only those commands that are lawful , i.e. , constitutional .
For many decades , the NRA has spent a lot of resources in what can only be described as sucking up disgustingly to the military and the cops ; it 's past time we got something out of it .
( I 'm an ex-reservist , my brother 's a deputy , and we both grew up in the Air Force , so do n't give me a hard time this is the truth , and we all know it . )
NINTH , I 'd want the NRA to give up the self - defeating notion that you can keep guns OUT of the hands of the " wrong " folks , while simultaneously and miraculously keeping them IN the hands of the " right " folks .
Each of us is somebody else 's badguy .
In the last century , laws were passed to keep guns from Italians and the Irish .
Earlier this century it was blacks and now it 's those who believe in the Bill of Rights .
Get it straight : the latter could never have happened if the former had n't been possible .
No more background checks , NRA , no more prior restraint .
History , ancient and recent , clearly shows that if the badguys have guns , the only way to handle it is to make sure as many goodguys have guns as possible .
TENTH , while we 're on the subject of prior restraint , I 'd want the NRA to abandon its strategically idiotic enthusiasm for government - controlled concealed carryillegal under the Second Amendment in favor of uncontrolled and legal " Vermont Carry " .
If it wo n't , I guarantee that in years to come , someone will say : the NRA wants your name on this piece of paper BEFORE you 'll be allowed to exercise your unalienable individual , Constitutional , civil , and human rights .
The NRA wants your age , address , phone , sex , race , social security number , photograph , and fingerprints as a cost of doing what the Framers meant you to do without all that .
In short , it wants to impose the very system of gun and owner registration we 've been fighting more than 60 years !
Huey Long , virtual dictator of Louisiana in the 1930s when Mussolini was making the trains run on time , was asked by the press , " Will we ever have fascism in America ? "
" Yes , " Long replied with a grin , " but we 'll call it ANTIfascism . "
I can guarantee that someone will say all of this , because if nobody else does , I will .
And to the advocates of licensed carry , I say now : do n't you realize how pathetic you look , lying there with your OWN foot on your neck ?
ELEVENTH , I 'd want the NRA to make endorsements based on the candidate 's respect for the Second Amendment , regardless of his affiliation or its estimate of his chances .
It 's suicidal if only because it denies us leverage we'd otherwise possess over the Republicans to say a third party candidate can't win , and on that self - fulfilling basis , withhold endorsement that could give him , and us , a victory .
If " NRA " stands for " National Republican Association " let it be said plainly and stop what amounts to a consumer fraud .
If not , then if a candidate 's unwilling to be photographed for public consumption firing a machine gun , a semiautomatic rifle with a long , curved magazine , or a pistol with a fat , two - column grip , he can't be trusted whatever his affiliation , and should n't be endorsed .
TWELFTH , I 'd want the NRA to reduce its Board of Directors to no more than 20 , so they can lead instead of turning things over to a tiny , often misguided elite .
One director I know told me the NRA is in trouble precisely because its huge , unwieldy board flounders helplessly , leaving policy in the hands of a " troika " with its own agenda .
It 's time for that to end .
In general , I 'd give the NRA the same advice I give everybody else .
Never let anybody keep you from enjoying your rights to the fullest , not for a day , not for a minute .
Never let anybody stand in your way .
Never accept even the most reasonable - sounding excuse for why you can't have everything you deserve .
Never accept compromise .
Worse than thieves , murderers , or cannibals , those who offer compromise slow you and sap your vitality while pretending to be your friends .
They are not your friends .
Compromisers are the enemies of all humanity , the enemies of life itself .
Compromisers are the enemies of everything important , sacred , and true .
So , would I join the NRA all over again , after 22 years , knowing everything I know today ?
I guess I 'm still thinking about it .
Give me a reason , NRA .

Blogger : Jon Stewart ' slays the homophobic Huckabee ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 10 , 2008
Print This Email This
When former Arkansas governor and conservative Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee appeared on The Daily Show on Tuesday , Jon Stewart pressed him hard on the issue of gay marriage , knocking down one false argument after another .
As blogger Pam Spaulding at Pam's House Blend commented appreciatively , " Jon Stewart asked serious questions any hard - hitting progressive journalist or political commentator with a talk show is perfectly capable of asking .
He made Huckabee explain his positions on LGBT rights and connects it to the messages in his new book about the merits of social conservatism that he 's hawking . "
" Please watch the whole interview , " Spaulding adds .
" It literally made me weep because Stewart gets it .
This is a human rights issue . "
Stewart began the interview by suggesting to Huckabee that there 's " one thing I guess I do n't understand about social conservatives .
...
You write that marriage is the bedrock of our society .
Why would you not want couples to buy into the stability of marriage ? "
" Marriage still means one man , one woman , life relationship , " Huckabee replied .
" The only way we can create the next generation is through a male - female relationship .
In 5000 years of recorded human history , that 's what marriage has meant . "
However , Stewart would n't let Huckabee get away with that assertion .
He pointed out that Huckabee was taking things " back to the Old Testament -- where polygamy was the norm .
...
Marriage has evolved greatly over those 5000 years from a property arrangement , polygamy .
We 've redefined it constantly . "
" It seems like a fundamental human right , " Stewart said of marriage .
" You write in your book that all people are created equal , and yet for gay people you believe that it is corrosive to society to allow them to have the privileges that all humans enjoy . "
Stewart then increasingly backed Huckabee into a corner , where in his attempts to avoid admitting that marriage is a fundamental right , Huckabee was left arguing that it is merely a legal arrangement that the government can define as it sees fit .
He concluded weakly that " those who support the idea of same - sex marriage have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of us . "
" It 's a travesty that people have forced someone who is gay to have to make their case that they deserve the same basic rights , " was Stewart 's response .

Update ,
02/24/09 : Some good folks over at NPR ( thank you , Andy Carvin and Bob Boilen ! ) are looking into the oversight written about here .
They ’ve since added proper credits to the piece .
Also ,
Zoë is currently listed as the # 2 seller on iTunes classical .
All ’s well that ends well .
Koko Theater , October 2008 , London . ⓒ Polstar Photography .
I think my Coilhouse cohorts will agree that one of the very bestest things about being involved with this venture is being able to give props to lovable people who do lovely things .
I ’ve been meaning to sing the praises of cellist Zoë Keating for ages now .
She ’s a visionary artist with immense talent and soul… and a sweetheart to boot .
When we first met several years ago , she was playing second fiddle ( so to speak ) in Melora Creager ’s honorable neo-Victorian outfit , Rasputina .
At the time , I was astonished by Zoë ’s incredible ear and deep , rich tone .
As it turns out , I was only hearing select facets of what she ’s capable of .
Zoë Keating opening for Amanda Palmer last year .
Shot by AleXIXandra .
More recently , Zoë has been self - producing and releasing solo recordings of a project she calls One Cello x 16 , in which she deftly uses live electronic sampling , looping and repetition to create lush , beautiful layers of sound .
Zoë is classically trained but a swashbuckler at heart ; her music builds a hypnotic , swaying bridge between the old guard and the new .
Ambient , pop , and orchestral sensibilities trade off , with each distinctive element bolstered by her powerful musicianship and sensitivity .
Regretfully , the reason I ’m finally getting around to writing about Zoë is a bit of frustration I ’m feeling on her behalf .
NPR ’s show All Things Considered used a song of hers yesterday without permission or credit .
Zoë ’s been featured on NPR before –a great opportunity for her– but in my opinion , that ’s no excuse for their programmers to assume she ’d be fine with them arbitrarily yoinking her work and using it anonymously .
NPR is supposed to support off - the - beaten - path artists , not exploit ’em , right ?
Photo by David Peterman during the “ Who Killed Amanda Palmer ” tour , 2008 .
Zoë , understandably , feels conflicted about the situation :
People have written saying I should be flattered .
Yeah , I ’m flattered , but I have mixed feelings .
I feel the same as [ I did ] when a Channel 4 doc used my music without permission , money or credit .
I ’m flattered … but also bummed that 1 ) my music is n’t worth anything and 2 ) no one thought to ask if I cared about how they edited it , or in what context it ’s used .
Also , the economics of it are kind of a bummer … I ’m an obscure experimental musician .
Just a link on the All Things Considered music page , along with all the other links to music used in yesterday ’s show , would help .
RadioLab is a good example of this .
They use my music with my permission and they credit me .
I am happy for them to do this because I love and support what they do , and I benefit from increased exposure and substantial iTunes sales ( thank you RadioLab ! ) .
That is a fair exchange … ( although sometimes I think I should pay a cut to RadioLab because they have helped me so much ) .
Sometimes this business is such uphill going that I have to remind myself why I spend all my time doing it ( er , why ?
something about the need to create , blah blah ) .
Maybe it would be easier to go back to being an Information Architect and just [ doing ] a little music in the evenings for my own benefit .
Ha !
Not likely .
Whew !
Thank goodness for that , lady !
Do n’t you go anywhere .
( Except maybe Australia , with Amanda Fucking Palmer .
That ’d be okay , I guess . )
I ’m hoping this post will send at least few new pairs of ears Zoë ’s way .
Maybe some of you seasoned fans will spread the word as well ?
You can buy Zoë Keating ’s gorgeous music on iTunes , eMusic , Amazon , or directly through her site .
Support this woman .
She deserves all the credit in the world .

When Barack Obama signs the draft order to tear down the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , he will end at a stroke one of most shameful chapters in American foreign policy history .
Since 2002 , when the first Muslim prisoners were taken from the battlefields of Afghanistan to the US naval base in Cuba , the camp 's high razor wire fences and the inmates ' orange jumpsuits have become synonymous with the injustice of the US war on terror .
Repeated allegations of torture and abuse made by the prisoners have added to the controversy .
But nothing seemed to sway President George Bush in his determination to override international law and hold suspects in unlawful detention without charge or trial .
Those brought here are classified as " enemy combatants " in a crude legal attempt to sidestep the protections of the Geneva Conventions .
In six years , nearly 800 prisoners have passed through the detention blocks of Guantanamo , where at least four inmates have committed suicide and dozens more failed in their attempts .
The high security detention camp , known as Camp Delta , houses three smaller centres called Camp Echo , Camp Iguana , and Camp X - Ray , but are collectively referred to as Guantanamo or , in militaryspeak , Gitmo .
The toughest task facing the Obama administration will be finding homes for the remaining 245 inmates .
It is likely that 21 prisoners , including the mastermind of the 11 September attacks , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who are already facing military tribunals , will be put on trial in civilian or military courts in America .
Cases against another 60 suspects where there is evidence to support charges will be reviewed by a new team of prosecutors .
Disposal of the remainder , including two men claiming British residency , will require delicate diplomatic negotiations with their home governments .
Some , including a number of Algerians , cannot be sent home because they face possible detention and torture by their own governments who view them as Islamic terrorists .
European governments , including Britain's , have been asked to help close the camp by taking prisoners who may have no links with their country .
So far , Portugal and , more recently , Ireland and Switzerland , are thought to be the only countries prepared to make such an offer .
But it will be negotiations with the state of Yemen which will be key to the success of any release programme .
More than 100 of the detainees are believed to be Yemeni nationals .
But because the Bush administration has refused to negotiate with the Islamic state , little progress has been made .
Britain has formally requested the release of two of its detainees , Binyam Mohamed , 38 , an Ethiopian refugee and British resident who has been held at Guantanamo for four years , and Shaker Aamer , 41 , a Saudi married to a British woman .
The British residence status of a third detainee , Ahmed Belbacha , 39 , an Algerian who lived in London , is disputed by Britain .
All three are now expected to be brought back to Britain .
Guantanamo has been described by senior judges all over the world as a legal limbo and a stain on the founding principles of American justice .
President Obama knows that if he really wants to bring America back under the rule of law which he promised to do during the electoral campaign and in his inauguration speech , then Guantanamo is the place were he must begin the job .
Detained without rights :
Three terror suspects
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
In March 2007 , after four years in captivity , including six months at Guantanamo Bay , he confessed to masterminding the 11 September attacks , the attempt by the British shoe bomber , Richard Reid , to blow up an airliner over the Atlantic Ocean , the Bali nightclub bombing in Indonesia and the bombing of the World Trade Centre in 1993 .
He is expected to be tried by a court on the US mainland .
Binyam Mohamed
Binyam Mohamed , a 31 - year - old Ethiopian granted refugee status by the UK , was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and handed to US agents .
He claims they flew him to a jail in Morocco , where he was tortured , before being transferred to a US prison in Afghanistan and then Guantanamo in 2004 .
All terror charges against him were dropped last year and he is expected to be returned to Britain .
Shaker Aamer
Shaker Aamer , a Saudi national who lived in Britain and had applied for British nationality , was abducted in Pakistan and sold to US forces for $ 5,000 .
Mr Shaker , 40 , and his British wife , Zennira , have four British children , aged between five and nine , the youngest of whom Mr Shaker has never seen .
The British Government have offered him residence and he is expected to be one of the first released .
800
Prisoners have passed through Guantanamo .

At the milder end of the spectrum are the theorists who believe that the US government had prior warning of the attacks but did not do enough to stop them .
Others believe that the Bush administration deliberately turned a blind eye to those warnings because it wanted a pretext to launch wars in the Middle East to usher in another century of American hegemony .
A large group of people - collectively called the 9/11 Truth Movement - cite evidence that an airliner did not hit the Pentagon and that the World Trade Centre could not have been brought down by airliner impacts and burning aviation fuel alone .
This final group points to video evidence which they claim shows puffs of smoke - so - called demoliton squibs - emerging from the Twin Towers at levels far below the aircraft impact zones and prior to the collapses .
They also believe that , on the day itself , the US air force was deliberately stood down or sent on exercises to prevent intervention that could have saved the lives of nearly 3,000 people .
If you checked the upcoming schedule for the University of Memphis Tigers , this Wednesday ’s ( February 18th ) game looks like nothing special .
It ’s at home against Conference USA cellar dweller Southern Methodist .
As a Top Ten ranked program , it should be an easy win for the Tigers .
And it may still be , but not without a little controversy .
With a cupcake on the schedule , the school dubbed Wednesday “ FedEx Appreciation Night , ” and asked the NCAA permission to wear FedEx ’s colors in place of the normal blue and gray to honor the event .
The NCAA agreed , and Memphis even had uniforms designed for the occasion .
Now , some may see this as another step in the whoring out of athletics to advertisers .
It was n’t that long ago that we discussed on this site the cross-promotion between the Tampa Bay Lightning and the movie Saw V .
But remember that FedEx is a Memphis - based company and its executives have reportedly been bankrolling Tiger athletics , especially Tiger Basketball for much of the past decade ( and not in an illegal way , just as boosters ) .
Alas , the uniforms are not going to happen .
Upon further review , both Memphis and FedEx decided to scrap the idea after fear of public backlash .
I guess even bad publicity is n’t worth it in this economy .
Personally I do n’t fault Memphis .
Maybe it was n’t the best way to say thank you , but at least they tried something to benefit their main sponsor and maybe butter them up before advertising and donations start to get cut with the economy in the crapper .
And for one night the Memphis Tigers look like the Phoenix Suns in a game no one will remember a year from now .
It ’s not like it was a permanent thing and no FedEx logos were involved .
It was n’t like the football team suddenly started looking like the picture above .
What do you think about the whole issue ?
[ poll id = ” 18 ″ ]
HOUSE REPUBLICANS , 98 % ON BOARD ….
Yesterday , the House Republican caucus released a list of “ what they call wasteful provisions in the Senate version of the nearly $ 900 billion stimulus bill that is being debated . ”
It is , to be sure , a pretty long list , identifying 32 specific spending measures that the GOP considers either wasteful , lacking stimulative value , or both .
Now , putting aside the merit of the provisions , I went ahead and did some back - of - the - envelope math , adding up the grand total of all of the measures in question .
I came up with a total of roughly $ 18.7 billion .
That is obviously a lot of money .
What ’s more , it ’s a much larger sum than House Republicans were complaining about last week ( GOP staffers no doubt went back to look for additional “ waste ” ) .
But we ’re still left with the same problem we had yesterday —
Obama said policymakers should n’t “ let very modest differences get in the way of the overall [ stimulus ] package moving forward swiftly , ” and the differences really are modest .
While $ 18.7 billion is a serious chunk of change , it ’s also just 2 % of the $ 884.5 billion package under consideration in the Senate .
In other words , after House Republicans carefully combed through the bill , searching for anything they could deem “ wasteful , ” and finding 32 specific measures they found offensive , the GOP lawmakers are still comfortable with 98 % of the Democrats ’ bill .
After screaming “ pork ! ” and “ waste ! ” non -stop for weeks , these guys really should have been able to come up with more than just 2 % of the bill .
A list like this one is practically an endorsement of the administration ’s agenda .
PORTSMOUTH � A Richards Avenue resident is being held on cash bail for a felony charge alleging he displayed his middle finger to someone who had a protection order against him .
PORTSMOUTH � A Richards Avenue resident is being held on cash bail for a felony charge alleging he displayed his middle finger to someone who had a protection order against him .
Carlos Enriquez , 42 , of 177 Richards Ave. , is scheduled to be arraigned Monday on a felony charge of violating a protective order and a class A misdemeanor count of stalking .
Both charges allege that on Jan. 24 Enriquez held up his middle finger to the victim while both were dining separately at the Friendly Toast , at 121 Congress St .
According to an affidavit by Officer Richard Brabazon , the incident occurred in front of Enriquez�s child and that he eventually left the restaurant �with some assistance from restaurant staff . �
Police Sgt. Kuffer Kaltenborn said violation of protective order charges can be brought as felonies when the allegations are second offenses .
However , the city prosecution office is expected to dismiss the felony against Enriquez on Monday , leaving the misdemeanor count of stalking , said Kaltenborn .

As I ’ve announced earlier , and if you follow me on Twitter , I ’ve been doing a bit of Haskell lately through the Real World Haskell book club that I started .
Most recently , through our learnings , we have been covering the basic fundamentals of functional programming .
The most fundamental piece to this is to understand how to apply the basic three higher - order functions , map , filter and fold .
This time , we ’re covering the fold function in a neat challenge to convert functions which use explicit recursion to use folds instead .
So , what are folds anyways ?
Understanding Folds
What is a fold anyhow ?
Simply put , a fold is a higher - order function that knows how to reduce a given data structure ( typically a sequence of elements ) into a single return value .
We could describe it as doing something to each value in the list , updating an accumulator as we go , and returning the value of the accumulator when we ’re finished .
There are two sorts of folds , a left fold and a right fold .
The difference is the way the data is “ folded ” , as we will discuss here shortly .
The Left Fold
The left fold is used for folding from the left , otherwise known as the start of the list .
The basic definition of the left fold is the following in Haskell :
— Left Fold
foldl :: ( a -> b -> a ) -> a -> [ b ] –> a
The left fold function takes a step function , an initial value for the accumulator , and the list itself .
The function calls the step function on the current accumulator and current element in the list , and then passes the new accumulator value to itself recursively to build up the accumulator until the list is exhausted .
To understand how this works , let ’s walk through a simple example of the trite factorial , walking through each step of the calculation .
In this example , we ’ll walk through each step of calculating the factorial of 3 in F# .
List . fold_left (*) 1 [ 1..3 ]
= List.fold_left (*) ( 1 * 1 ) ( 2 : : 3 : : [ ] )
= List . fold_left ( *) ( ( 1 * 1 ) * 2 ) ( 3 : :[ ] )
= List.fold_left ( *) ( ( ( 1 * 1 ) * 2 ) * 3 ) ( [ ] )
= ( ( ( 1 * 1 ) * 2 ) * 3 )
= 6
Now that we have a basic handle on how this is done , let ’s look at the other fold function and what it can do for us .
The Right Fold
The other type of fold is the right fold , which folds from the right , or end of a given list .
The basic definition of a right fold is the following in Haskell :
— Right fold
foldr :: ( a -> b -> b ) -> b -> [ a ] –> b
The signature looks very similar to the left fold , so in order to see the difference between the two , let ’s walk through a right fold of our factorial once again .
List . fold_right ( * ) [ 1..3 ] 1
= 1 * List.fold_right (*) ( 2 : : 3 : : [ ] ) 1
= 1 * ( 2 * List . fold_right ( *) ( 3 : :[ ] ) 1 )
= 1 * ( 2 * ( 3 * List.fold_right ( *) ( [ ] ) 1 ) )
= 1 * ( 2 * ( 3 * 1 ) )
= 6
The difference between the two should be a little bit more apparent now .
With a left fold , the empty list element is on the left , and the parentheses group to the left .
With our right fold , the 1 value is on the right , and the parentheses group to the right .
But , how useful is it ?
Well , we could write any number of functions such as filter and map in terms of a right fold such as the following :
let filter ’ p xs =
let step x ys = if p x then x : : ys else ys
List .
fold_right step xs [ ] filter ’ p xs =step x ys =p xysysListfold_right step xs let map ’ f xs =
let step x ys = f x :: ys
List.fold_right step xs [ ]
And that brings us to our challenge today , of rewriting other functions using folds instead of explicit recursion .
But , first , let ’s look at one fold function you may already be familiar with .
The LINQ Aggregate
Sure enough , the LINQ Aggregate function is an implementation of a left fold .
Let ’s look at the signature of one of the Aggregate overloads to get an idea of how it maps to our above functions :
public static TAccumulate Aggregate < TSource , TAccumulate >(
this IEnumerable < TSource > source ,
TAccumulate seed ,
Func< TAccumulate , TSource , TAccumulate > func ) ;
As you can see , we have our source , the seed and a function which passes the the accumulator and the current element to calculate the new accumulator value .
We could now use LINQ to implement our factorial function once again such as the following in C# :
// Left fold
Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , 3 ) .
Aggregate ( 1 , ( a , n ) => a * n ) ) ; Enumerable .
Range ( ) .
Aggregate ( , ( a , n ) => a * n ) ) ; //
Right fold by way of a left fold
Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , 3 ) . Aggregate < int , Func< int , int >>
( x => x , ( f , n ) => x => f(x * n ) ) ( 1 ) ) ;
LINQ was built on the standard three higher - order functions of map ( Select ) , filter ( Where ) and Fold ( Aggregate ) .
Understanding the fold is probably the more difficult to understand of them , but one of the most powerful .
Bart De Smet covers more of the subject in detail in his post Folding left , right and the LINQ aggregation operator .
But , now it ’s time we stop postponing and get to the challenge !
The Challenge
Question 10 in Chapter 4 of the Real World Haskell book gives a particularly interesting challenge .
How many of the following standard Prelude functions can be rewritten as folds :
any
cycle
words
unlines
Let ’s take each one of these and determine whether you can take the standard definition and rewrite them using folds .
The first function is the any function which is defined here :
— Applies a predicate to each item in the list to see if
— any satisfies
any :: ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] ->
Bool
any _ [ ] = False
any p ( x :xs ) = p x || any p xs
Or as written in F# , might look something like this :
let rec any ( p : ‘ a -> bool ) : ‘ a list -> bool = function
| [ ] -> false
| x : : xs -> p x | | any p xs ; ;
The logic for this function is rather straight forward :
If the incoming list is empty , then return false
Else , apply a logical - or to the predicate of the head and the recursive call to the any function to determine the result
The behavior of the function should operate as the following :
ghci > any even [ 1,3,5,7,8,9 ]
True
The question is , can we rewrite this function as a fold , and if so how ?
The answer is actually quite simple .
By applying a right fold , we are able to step through each value and pass a Boolean accumulator which allows us to determine if any matched our predicate function .
We wo n’t bother applying the function to our item in the list if we should already be true .
Knowing this , could now rewrite the any such as the following :
any ’ :: ( a -> Bool ) -> [ a ] ->
Bool
any ’ p = foldr step False
where step x acc = acc || p x
Just as easily , we could write this in F# as well using the List .
fold_right , such as this :
let any ’ ( p : ‘ a -> bool ) ( xs : ‘ a list ) : bool =
let step x acc = acc | | p x
List .
fold_right step xs false
We can now verify the behavior of our any ’ function such as the following :
> let even x = x % 2 = 0
any ’ even [ 1 ; 3 ; 5 ; 7 ; 8 ; 9 ] ;;
val it : bool = true
Our next challenge is the cycle function .
This function is defined as the following :
— Takes a finite list and turns it into an infinite circular one
cycle :: [ a ] -> [ a ]
cycle [ ] = error “ Prelude.cycle : empty list ”
cycle xs = xs ’ where xs ’ = xs ++ xs ’
The behavior of the function should operate as the following :
ghci > let c = take 10 .
cycle
ghci > c [ 1..3 ]
[ 1,2, 3, 1,2,3,1,2,3,1 ]
Since Haskell is a lazily evaluated language , such constructs as these work nicely to create an infinite list .
And since F# is not , let ’s skip this example and focus on Haskell only .
Trying to replicate the code here will only cause nice StackOverflowExceptions to occur and we do n’t want that .
So , how would we solve this problem using a fold ?
Consider the following logic :
Apply a right fold with a concat operator to bind collections
Repeat input using the repeat function instead of recursion
Our solution might look something like this :
cycle ’ :: [ a ] -> [ a ]
cycle ’ xs = foldr ( ++ ) [ ] ( repeat xs )
We can verify the behavior of our code now such as the following :
ghci > let c = take 10 .
cycle ’
ghci > c [ 1..3 ]
[ 1,2, 3, 1,2,3,1,2,3,1 ]
The next challenger is the words function .
This function is defined as the following :
— Breaks a string into a list based upon whitespace
words :: String -> [ String ]
words s = case dropWhile isSpace s of
“ ” -> [ ]
s’ -> w : words s ”
where ( w , s ” ) =
break isSpace s ’
The behavior of the function should operate as the following :
ghci > words “ foo bar ”
[ “ foo ” , ” bar ” ]
For those who are coming from the F# world , you may realize that Haskell treats strings as character lists , as opposed to an IEnumerable < char > .
Looking at the above code sample , how might we be able to use a fold instead of recursion here ?
Consider the following logic :
Accumulate a list of strings as we build our result
If we encounter a space , we drop it , and then cons an empty to the accumulator
Else , we cons the character to our list .
Let ’s see how that looks in code :
words ’ :: String -> [ String ]
words ’ [ ] = [ [ ] ]
words ’ s = foldr step [ [ ] ]
s
where step c acc@( a:as ’)
| isSpace c = [ ] : acc
| otherwise = ( c:a ) : as ’
Of course , we could write this using F# as well , although it ’s not quite as elegant , due to the fact that strings are not considered character lists , but instead sequences .
Let ’s go over briefly what the code might look like :
module Char =
let is_space = System .
Char .
IsWhiteSpace Char =is_space = SystemCharIsWhiteSpace module String =
let of_list ( xs:char list ) : string =
new string ( Array.of_list xs ) let words ’ : string -> string list =
let words ” : char list -> char list list = function
| [ ] -> [ [ ] ]
| s -> let step c acc =
let ( a:: as‘ ) = acc
if Char.is_space c then [ ] :: acc
else ( c::a ) :: as ‘
List.fold_right step s [ [ ] ]
Seq.to_list >> words ” >>
List.map String.of_list
We can verify the behavior of the function in F# such as the following :
> words ’ “ foo bar ” ;;
val it : string list = [ “ foo ” ; “ bar ” ]
The final challenge is the unlines function .
It is defined as the following :
— Joins strings together with a line terminator in between
unlines :: [ String ] ->
String
unlines [ ] = [ ]
unlines ( l:ls ) = l ++ ‘
’ : unlines ls
What this function does is to take each line and concat the a cons of an ‘
’ character plus the recursive call to unlines .
Knowing what we know from the above examples , this should also be easy .
How might we do it ?
Let ’s take the following logic :
Use a fold right to enumerate the lines
Create a step function which first concats the \r
( Windows style ) and then concats the rest of the list
Use an empty list accumulator
unlines ’ :: [ String ] ->
String
unlines ’ = foldr step [ ]
where step = ( (++ ) . (++ “ \r
” ) )
Using some of these techniques , we could also apply this to F# as well .
Taking the List module from above , we could write the code as the following :
let flip f x y = f y x
let unlines ’ ( xs : string list ) : string =
let step = ( ( @ ) << ( flip ( @ ) ( Seq .
to_list “ \r
” ) ) )
List .
fold_right step ( List . map Seq .
to_list xs ) [ ] | > String .
of_list
We can now evaluate the results of our function such as the following which should follow our expected behavior .
> unlines ’ [ “ foo ” ; “ bar ” ] ;;
val it : string = “ foo\r
bar\r
”
So the answer to the question is , yes , all of the above functions can be expressed in terms of a fold function .
And I think we learned a bit along the way as well .
Conclusion
In functional programming , the use of folds are extremely common .
With a little practice , as I ’ve shown above , we will have an easier time understanding how to use folds instead of explicit recursion .
Indeed , many of the problems for which we use explicit recursion to solve could easily be solved with folds .
Why use folds over explicit recursion ?
Because using folds gives us well defined and explicit behavior , whereas explicit recursion may take many forms and harder to get just right .
By applying the basic three higher - order functions , we only need to learn this behavior once and then anyone who looks at our code will quickly understand our intent .
Because of this , you ’ll be able to write much more concise code .
If you look at Google News a year ago , you will notice they said they had " 4,500 news " sources .
Now , if you visit Google News today , you will see they have 25,000 news sources .
I do not know when Google changed that number , but I believe it was some time in the recent past .
I know publishers are constantly being added as sources to Google News but to explode from 4,500 sources to 25,000 sources in a year ?
Wow , that is pretty impressive .
Does quality suffer ?
I am not sure .

The agenda was telegraphed in Kobe Bryant ’s eyes , which were fixed in a cold stare Monday night , and in a taut expression that varied between hyper-serious and hyper - focused .
There were no mischievous grins , the sort that Bryant often flashes between basketball magic tricks , no outward sign that he was enjoying his own history - making night at Madison Square Garden .
The 1,000 - watt smile only came later , 45 minutes after Bryant had wrapped up a record - breaking 61 - point gem that sent the Knicks into a funk and moved the crowd to a delirious standing ovation .
The night ended with a 126 - 117 victory by the Los Angeles Lakers , and with Bryant joining two legends in Garden lore .
He passed Michael Jordan for the most points scored by an opponent at the current Garden , and passed Bernard King , the former Knicks great , for the most points scored by anyone there .
The 19,763 in attendance roared in appreciation .
The Knicks simply acknowledged the virtuoso performance , seeming grateful it was over .

If you could be any comic book character , who would it be ?
Obviously Superman because he has no weaknesses except a green rock .
But realistically , I ’d say Spider - Man .
Which title has fallen farthest from grace ?
X - Men has fallen because there are so many titles bearing the X - Men name that they ’ve forgotten what it was about .
Which has risen like a phoenix out of the ashes of suck - itude ?
Daredevil .
He was a good character before but the way he ’s being written now and the character development is excellent .
How long have you worked in a comic store ?
How did you start ?
I ’ve been working here for 10 months .
I worked at another store for two years at the end of the ’90s but got laid off when the store closed .
The comic book industry crashed then .
Then everyone started jumping in during Superman # 75 , when he died .
All the different covers and new companies started coming in and flushing the market with bad books .
I think we ’re actually higher now than we ’ve ever been .
With all the movies coming out , Ironman and Dark Knight , it ’s definitely one of the biggest industries I can think of .

What are the best and worst parts about working in a comic store ?
The best part is the people and talking comics everyday .
The worst part is seeing the same comic over and over again .
Or the actual shipments of comics .
It ’s more labor than you ’d think .
A big store like us gets a couple thousand of each book every week and we ’re on the second floor without an elevator .
What ’s the least nerdy thing about you ?
I have a girlfriend and social life and a real life outside the store .
Biggest pet peeve about customers ?
The perfectionists .
Like the clerks with the eggs , inspecting each one .
The people that look for the perfect , most valuable comic hoping to keep it for 10 years , but in reality it wo n’t be worth a lot of money because there are so many out there .
They are n’t as rare as they used to be .
What ’s the worst misconception about comic books and their fans ?
That we ’re fat , nerdy and do n’t have any lives .
Everyday I see businessmen and women come in .
It ’s all different types of people and that Simpsons Comic Book Store Guy does n’t really represent any of them .
Why is there such a big crossover between comic book fans and tech junkies ?
A lot of people raised on comics were also raised on computers and the internet presents new ways to keep up with the comics .
Sites like Newsarama.com keep people informed on upcoming storylines and keep people connected .
One promotes the other .

If you could be any comic book character , who would it be ?
My two favorites are Superman and Spider - Man. Superman is the ideal .
He was the first superhero and shows you the best of what humanity could be but it ’s reflected through the eyes of an outsider , someone who is not human .
Then I like Spider - Man because he discovers his powers and , in a very human way , uses them to get the girl and get some money and not be a geek anymore .
Then he learns a lesson about responsibility and decides to use his powers for the good of all .
Which title has fallen farthest from grace ?
That can vary on a month - to - month basis .
The Ultimates is the least recognizable when compared to the run before it .
Jeph Loeb and Joe Madureira are great writers but it ’s such a tonal shift from what Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch did that it ’s just too much of a shock .
Which has risen like a phoenix out of the ashes of suck - itude ?
Green Lantern is on the way up .
A while back they replaced the main character Hal Jordan with a new Green Lantern , Kyle Rayner .
But he was never the equal of his predecessor .
It was hard for fans to take .
Then they had Hal turn evil .
But when they restarted the title they brought Hal Jordan back but the writer Geoff Johns made a strong move and kept Kyle Rayner .
It kept the new fans without upsetting the old fans .
He also brought back the Green Lantern Core .
How long have you worked in a comic store ?
How did you start ?
I ’ve worked here for four years .
I was recommended by a friend who had just become an assistant manager .
It ’s a very collegial atmosphere .
I ’ve made some of my best friends and met a lot of connections to the industry .
There ’s a lot of great talent that comes in and it ’s good to be a part of that creative nexus .

What are the best and worst parts about working in a comic store ?
The best part is doing a job that you enjoy .
Nine times out of 10 if you work at a comic book store it ’s because you love comics .
Learning more about comics , talking to people who love them and working with people who love them .
There is little more you could ask of your 9 - to - 5 job .
What ’s the least nerdy thing about you ?
That ’s a bold question .
Contrary to the popular belief regarding the average comic - book - reading male , I have a girlfriend .
Biggest pet peeve about customers ?
It can be bothersome when someone is going to show you a pack of cards and ask you how much it is , and you see the price tag right there on it .
What ’s the worst misconception about comic books and their fans ?
That comics are only for kids and they ’re infantile and immature .
The thing that ’s on the tip of everyone ’s tongue right now is Alan Moore ’s Watchmen , which is one of the most literary works in comics .
You can not call that anything less than artwork .
The biggest misconception of the fans is that we ca n’t hold a conversation in polite society .
They think we ’re just people who eat , sleep and breathe comics and science fiction .
But we are people who have girlfriends and go out on Friday nights and we know how to be out in a social setting .
Why is there such a big crossover between comic book fans and tech junkies ?
First of all , for the geek or nerd subculture the two things have always go together .
The smart and nerdy people were ostracized in high school and they could n’t get that level of social interaction so they live vicariously through comics .
That ’s why smarter people , tech junkies , can get into comics .
Also , on another level it ’s interesting to see where technology can go through comics .
Like Ironman who bases all his inventions on things humanity may need in 10 or 20 years .
It ’s very much in line with what ’s the next technology will be .
It can be inspiring .

If you could be any comic book character , who would it be ?
That ’s a strange question .
I do like the idea of having a superpower or being a character , but I ’ve never really wanted that to be me .
I always liked the character Colossus because he ’s a big guy and I was a really big kid .
You get ideas about him because of his size but it turns out that he ’s an artist , like I am as well .
He ’s a sensitive guy .
He has a strength in his heart .
So maybe him .
Which title has fallen farthest from grace ?
Wow .
Half of Marvel ’s books .
That ’s mean .
Marvel ’s become very repetitive , redundant and kinda cookie - cutter .
Just like gimmicky writing .
They did terrible things with Spider - Man .
The character was going in such a great direction when J. Michael Straczynski was writing him .
Aunt May knew he was Spider - Man and he was growing exponentially and going to a different place .
He was n’t just this teenager anymore .
He ’s out of college now and 26 or 27 and some writers still treat him like a teen .
They sacrifice quality over quantity and put out too many books .
Which has risen like a pheonix out of the ashes of suck - itude ?
I think Justice Society of America is a wonderful book .
They had a series in the late ’90s and early 2000s that was really good and now what they ’re doing is super - relevant and superoriginal .
It ’s these characters that no one really knows or cares about but if any one really picked up that book , I think they ’d be reading it .
For the first 10 or 15 issues I was like a crackhead waiting for the next issue of JSA .
How long have you worked in a comic store ?
How did you start ?
I ’ve been working at Forbidden Planet for about eight months but my other store I started back in ’03 or ’02 .
I ’ve asked the owner since I was 8 to hire me because I always wanted to be there .
And finally I started picking up some Sundays and I ’ve been doing it ever since .

What are the best and worst parts about working in a comic store ?
The best parts are connecting people with comic books .
It ’s just wonderful .
When you recommend something for someone and they come back later and say , “ That was amazing !
What else you got for me ? ”
And they keep coming back .
A lot of people have preconceived notions because of movies and cartoons and do n’t understand how intelligent , original and inventive these books can be .
Especially work by Alan Moore and Grant Morrison .
Those guys are amazing .
The worst part would be the same as any retail job .
You have a manager on your ass and people just do n’t like you for some reason .
Some bigger stores have like eight managers .
What ’s the least nerdy thing about you ?
I ’m surprisingly smooth with ladies .
Biggest pet peeve about customers ?
When people ask stupid questions or do stupid things .
Typical rude things .
What ’s the worst misconception about comic books and their fans ?
That we ’re the stereotype of the geek .
Though I ’m a geek and I ’m proud .
The biggest misconception about comic books is that they ’re cheesy or corny or ridiculous or they ’re not intelligent writing .
The thing with comics is that it merges great writers with great artists ; it ’s two forms of art and storytelling combined .
People just see them as 2 - D , flat , with no structure .
And to those people I say , read The Invisibles .
Read Watchmen .
And if you think these are the exceptions , get back to me and I ’ll give you 15 other books that are just as good .
Why is there such a big crossover between comic book fans and tech junkies ?
It ’s that — I hate to say it — that escapist mindset .
You just like to be in other worlds and be other people .
Tech junkies like their massive multiplayer RPGs and a lot of comic book geeks do too .
Not all the time , but it ’s a factor .

If you could be any comic book character , who would it be ?
Hands down , Superman .
I ’m a big Superman fan and I ’m a big Batman fan .
But Batman ’s human and when he jumps off stuff , he gets hurt .
When Superman jumps off stuff , he flies .
It ’s what you want to be rather than what ’s real .
I like that approach better .
Which title has fallen farthest from grace ?
That ’s hard .
I ’d say Superman / Batman .
It started off really strong with Jeph Loeb , then he left and it ’s just been passed around .
It ’s the book you ’d think would be really good but it just is n’t .
I feel horrible because those are my favorite characters .
I do n’t pick up that book anymore .
Which has risen like a pheonix out of the ashes of suck - itude ?
I ’m gonna say Action Comics .
They had promised Richard Donner was gonna be on it and it would be really good but then it just fell of the face of the earth .
Then Geoff Johns who was writing with Richard Donner went on his own and wrote some of the best Superman stories I ’ve ever read .
Superman just turned 70 this year .
Seventy years of Superman stories and these are the best ones in the past few years .
He knows how to retell a character ’s story and make you care about it .
How long have you worked in a comic store ?
How did you start ?
Six months last week .
I ’d been stalking Midtown Comics since college and once I graduated I really went for it .
I told them how much I loved comics and eventually they hired me .
I ’ve been so involved in comics for a long time that how could I not do it ?
It just makes sense .

What are the best and worst parts about working in a comic store ?
The best part is definitely just being around comics and getting to see new stuff before other people do .
If you go into an office and walk from cubicle to cubicle you do n’t hear people talking about comics .
You hear , “ Oh I have to do this report . ” I get to talk comics at work .
I get to recommend stuff to people .
That ’s also one of the hardest parts — not getting too carried away .
It ’s a job and I have to pay attention to the floor , make sure there are enough comics on the wall and do inventory .
You ca n’t get too involved .
The real worst part is when it gets super busy on new - release day , Wednesday .
Around 5 o’clock there ’s a line goes from one end of the floor to the other and around the book shelves .
The floor is huge .
Keeping that in control is pretty crazy .
What ’s the least nerdy thing about you ?
I ’m a big sports nut .
I ’m a huge Yankees fan .
It ’s still nerdy because I ’m a stats guy .
But I ’m like any jock , screaming when someone scores .
What ’s the worst misconception about comic books and their fans ?
That we are people with no hygiene and that comics are for kids and that it ’s stupid stuff and you ca n’t take it seriously .
There are certainly fantasy elements , but why do people take Hollywood movies seriously and give them awards ?
I think the last few years with Dark Knight and Ironman , they legitimize the format for us .
Go into a comic shop and pick up something .
Do n’t judge it until you try it .
Why is there such a big crossover between comic book fans and tech junkies ?
That ’s easy .
You ’ve got characters like Batman and Ironman who are human .
But what makes them different is their training and their gadgets .
What tech junkie would n’t love to get in the Batmobile and test that GPS and all the other gadgets in there ?
Who would n’t want to make their own piece of armor and fly around and shoot people ?
Comics have always had an element of sci-fi and have always had technology that was semi-futuristic .
Techies love it .
I ’m also a Trekkie .
I love new technology and stuff .
It ’s all sort of related .
You also write scripts ?
Yeah , I have my own storylines and universes .
I developed a character called Raph and combined all my favorite books , kung - fu movies , LOTR , fantasy and adventure .
I ’ve got the guy ’s life mapped up from the moment he ’s born until he ’s 30 .
I know exactly what ’s going to happen .

If you could be any comic book character , who would it be ?
I ’m actually named after Olive Oyl .
But seriously , I think I might shoot myself .
That ’s really hard .
Probably because there is n’t a comic book character I ’d want to be .
I do n’t live vicariously through comics .
I think a lot of people tend to .
It ’s definitely escapist for me , but I do n’t like to pretend I ’m Superman .
Especially as a girl , you do n’t want to pretend to be the giant - breasted , platform - wearing … .
It just would n’t be fun .
But if I had to pick , it probably harkens back to when I was 12 and read Ghost World for the first time .
It would probably be Enid from Ghost World .
Which title has fallen farthest from grace ?
I do n’t read superhero comics and that ’s usually a superhero thing .
From what I ’ve heard — actually , I have n’t heard anything .
I never listen to what the customers say .
In my opinion , title - wise , potentially , Angry Youth Comix .
I love Johnny Ryan and I always have .
But it ’s getting pretty repetitive these days .
Less anal rape .
Which has risen like a phoenix out of the ashes of suck - itude ?
I tend to believe that the people who have a grasp on writing comics have always kind of been good .
Like Charles Burns and Adrian Tomine .
Dash Shaw was a student of my dad ’s and he has a grasp on it that I have n’t seen in a long time .
I really like Leah Hayes who wrote Holy Moly and Funeral for a Heart .
Who ’s your dad ?
He ’s Gary Panter .
He does the comic Jimbo but he ’s most well - known for designing the set for Pee - Wee ’s Playhouse and having Matt Groening rip off Bart from Jimbo , which Matt has admitted many times .
How long have you worked in a comic store ?
How did you start ?
Almost four years on and off .
I started when I was 14 and quit and returned and quit and returned and quit and returned .
My dad got me into it .
He works at the School of Visual Arts and it ’s nearby and Mark , the owner , really liked his comics .
I started on Sundays bagging books and now I come and do n’t do anything .

What are the best and worst parts about working in a comic store ?
The best part is definitely the free comics .
And I ’ve made some pretty great friends .
The worst part is that comics have a bad rap for a reason , because it really does tend to attract crazy people .
Surely they ’re not all like that , but I do get creepy stares all the time .
I ’m kind of used to it now .
The clientele can just be a bit irritating .
What ’s the least nerdy thing about you ?
Nerdy .
You have no idea .
I grew up so embroiled in it that it ’s kind of stupid to make myself not nerdy .
I ’m in a band , so maybe that ’s not nerdy .
But I even wear glasses and I go to art school and I work in a comic shop .
There ’s nothing not nerdy about me .
I have a designer jean fixation , but that ’s kind of retarded .
Biggest pet peeve about customers ?
Odors .
Most people are fine , but there is one that comes wearing just a pair of jogging shorts ( he ’s not in good shape ) , a wifebeater , and a towel around his neck .
He ’s perpetually mopping his head and his neck with his towel .
We also have two customers who compete on new comic book day to get the most intact comics .
But they get mad at us when one arrives before the other and gets the best comics .
What ’s the worst misconception about comic books and their fans ?
It ’s probably just that everyone is the stereotypical overweight , middle - aged , balding , lives - in - his - mother ’s basement comic geek .
I ’m the antithesis of everything that is but I was raised on comics .
And I love them and I would n’t trade them for anything .
I ’m going to read them until I die .
And they ’re easier to read than books when you ’re too exhausted .
Why is there such a big crossover between comic book fans and tech junkies ?
It goes back to the escapism .
If you are immersed in comics than you are trying to get away from something .
Kind of like videogames .
But I ca n’t stand videogames .
They scare me .
Do you have any anecdotes about working in a comic store ?
On a Wednesday , a regular customer came and bought a ton of comics as per usual .
Then the next day he came in he was completely scab - covered and bruised on his face .
We were like , “ Dude , what happened to you ?
Are you okay ? ”
Turns out he started falling down on a escalator while holding his comics and rather than protecting his face he protected his comics .
But they still got a little bent , so the next day he came back and re-bought them .

If you could be any comic book character , who would it be ?
Professor X so I could read the minds of my customers , no wheelchair though .
Which title has fallen farthest from grace ?
I would ’ve said the X - men , but it ’s back and now I ’m selling out of them .
DC Comics in general , Superman straight up .
Which has risen like a phoenix out of the ashes of suck - itude ?
All Star Batman & Robin started out shaky and now is the greatest thing ever .
How long have you worked in a comic store ?
How did you start ?
I was in the Atlanta Journal Constitution at 14 because I was such a big comic book collector , a comics junkie hard - core .
Neon has only been open for a year and I ’m the new kid on the block .
We have the chance to be the fresh start for people .
We ’re trying not to the be the dusty old comic store .

What are the best and worst parts about working in a comic store ?
Having all the comics at your disposal .
Which is also the worst part because I do n’t feel as compelled to collect them .
What ’s the least nerdy thing about you ?
My girlfriend , probably ; everything else is pretty nerdy .
Biggest pet peeve about customers ?
When people come in here and say ‘ Hey it ’s so great you ’re here , ’ when before they were coming in to say ‘ This is a bad location , you ’re never gonna make it . ’
What ’s the worst misconception about comic books and their fans ?
It ’s that they ’re for kids exclusively ; now they ’re more sophisticated .
And that all fans dress up in costumes and are all couch potatoes .
Why is there such a big crossover between comic book fans and tech junkies ?
Now with digital processors and color , it just really appeals to that sort of person .
And the tech sciences .

If you could be any comic book character , who would it be ?
Multiple Man .
If I could just copy myself a million times it ’d make my life so much easier .
Which title has fallen farthest from grace ?
Amazing Spider - Man .
They did this thing to fix a continuity issue .
Mary Jane and Peter Parker had been married so long it was starting to get boring and stagnate .
So Marvel decided to fix it .
Peter ’s aunt is dying and Mary Jane and Peter make a deal with Mephisto and in exchange for Peter ’s aunt ’s life , they have their memories erased and never knew they loved each other , in an Eternal Sunshine sort of twist .
Seventy percent of the customers hate it .
Which has risen like a phoenix out of the ashes of suck - itude ?
Now that the Uncanny X - men are in San Francisco , it ’s awesome .
How long have you worked in a comic store ?
How did you start ?
I ’ve worked here for 5 years .
Started by being a customer and was selling auto parts for Acura and it came up in conversation that the owner was selling the store .
We worked out a deal in a week .

What are the best and worst parts about working in a comic store ?
Best part :
The hours , flexibility , working with something I love and have loved all my life and the clientele .
Being my own boss .
Worst : Being my own boss , taxes , being bound to one distributor .
What ’s the least nerdy thing about you ?
Ha , I do n’t if I should say this but … I ’m an ex-con .
It was a long time ago and I ’m a good person now .
Biggest pet peeve about customers ?
I do n’t think I have one .
All are welcome here .
What ’s the worst misconception about comic books and their fans ?
Comics : that they are not a literary medium because they are .
And some are better than a lot of novels and I read both .
Fans :
That they are n’t very rounded people .
There is the fringe hardcore fanboy , but I sell to lawyers , meter maids , doctors , artists … and there ’s a growing female audience .
We have a new generation taking over , it ’s not crabby old fat dudes with ponytails telling you not to touch the books .
We want you to read it before you buy it .
I equate comic books stores now to what record stores were in the early ’ 80s .
Why is there such a big crossover between comic book fans and tech junkies ?
Both love the internet and their PS2’s .
I think that ’s our main competition , videogames .
When a new Madden comes out we ’re competing for those same dollars .

If you could be any comic book character , who would it be ?
Spider - Man , because he ’s just as human as the rest of us .
Which title has fallen farthest from grace ?
The whole Marvel Ultimate line , started off as a great concept and has just gotten silly .
Which has risen like a phoenix out of the ashes of suck - itude ?
Storm Watch started off as typical and has turned into something great .
How long have you worked in a comic store ?
How did you start ?

I got started in it because I got laid off from my high - tech job and realized I ’m not a very good corporate person so I should do something I like .

What are the best and worst parts about working in a comic store ?
Best part : Working with something I ’ve loved all my life and at least something of an expert .
Worst :
Any customer who comes in and we do n’t have what they ’re looking for and they take it personally .
What ’s the least nerdy thing about you ?
The fact that I help run a burlesque show .
Biggest pet peeve about customers ?
People who refer to comic books as graphic novels .
What ’s the worst misconception about comic books and their fans ?
Comics :
The big thing is that people think they are still just for kids which is entirely not the case and that reading comics is not acceptable as literature .
Fans :
That we ’re all like the comics store guy from The Simpsons .
We ’re just like everyone else .
Why is there such a big crossover between comic book fans and tech junkies ?
There is a lot of history in comics and that appeals to people who are in detail - oriented jobs .
There is an element of science in comic books , some of it is legitimate and some predicts future scientific developments .

If you could be any comic book character , who would it be ?
Most of my favorite characters are ones I really would not want to be — Hellboy , John Constantine , Spider - Man , Batman , Swamp Thing — I do n’t really envy them .
So I ’m gonna have to say Tom Strong .
He ’s at the peak of human strength and physical perfection .
He ’s a brilliant scientist and inventor with an apparently unlimited budget .
His aging is decelerated , but he ’s not immortal ( that ’s key ) .
He ’s got a giant house / base on a tropical island with his gorgeous and wise wife and lovely daughter who both team up with him regularly for superheroics .
Plus he ’s got a pneumatic robot and a brain - altered gorilla for comic relief .
Yup , Tom Strong for sure ( from the truly fantastic comic of the same name by Alan Moore ) .
Which title has fallen farthest from grace ?
Are we talking about long - running standards that have been through decades worth of storylines and creative teams , some with multiple classic or arguably classic periods with years in between ?
It really has a lot to do with when you first became interested in … The Amazing Spider - Man for example .
To a lot of fans , the Lee / Romita issues of the late ’60s and early ’ 70s are it and always will be .
I know a few Ditko purists who think even that ’s too new , though .
Then in the late ’ 80s , Venom made a huge impact on my generation , and that era became the basis for the past 20 years of a whole slew of spider - comics besides Amazing .
And just recently , J. Michael Straczynski ended his years - long run as writer , most of which is widely considered excellent , so that ’s like new classics .
So fans of every era believe ( or will believe ) that “ it used to be so good but now it sucks . ”
Short opinionated answer : Ultimates 3 is a giant piece of crap .
Frank Miller ’s goddamn Batman is goddamn awful .
The X - titles are currently all garbage .
The new Hulk ongoing sucks horribly , too .
Which has risen like a phoenix out of the ashes of suck - itude ?
DC ’s Booster Gold and Marvel ’s The Immortal Iron Fist are both characters that nobody expected to see returning in their own ongoing titles , much less that these books would be really good by all accounts .
Also , the current runs of Green Lantern ( by writer Geoff Johns ) and Captain America ( by writer Ed Brubaker ) are in my opinion better than those titles have ever been in the modern age of comics .
How long have you worked in a comic store ?
How did you start ?
I ’ve been with Dr. Comics full time for about five years .
I lived in the neighborhood and I ’ve been into comics since I was a kid so I ’d been a regular customer for a while before I mentioned to the boss that I could use another part - time job .

What are the best and worst parts about working in a comic store ?
The best part about it is the comics .
They ’re my world , and so obviously I love just being in such a fabulously stocked comic store , let alone making my living by being there .
Most of what I do in the store is all about our inventory : filing , stocking , reordering , etc. , so as a result I ’ve become familiar with just about everything in the store .
The worst part about it is having to overhear and occasionally being asked to weigh in on the who - would - win - in - a - fights .
Also , the constant barrage of comic book movie talk is unbearable .
I do not care what you think is going to happen in a sequel that does n’t come out for another five years and which is bound to disappoint .
What ’s the least nerdy thing about you ?
I get one pass , right ?
Pass .
Biggest pet peeve about customers ?
What gets to me is the speculators .
The people who are still collecting comics because they ’re collectible , buying what they think is likely to become valuable later so they can get rich or something .
This is flawed logic , and it devastated the comics industry just 10 years ago … and yet here we are again .
The comics that are worth real money today , are valuable for two reasons , one of which is that they were n’t valued when they were published .
Comics from the ’60s and earlier are exceedingly rare because so many copies were destroyed or discarded , and the ones that are still around are very “ well read , ” hence the insanely high selling prices for the very few pristine copies of key issues .
Modern comics have relatively high print runs , and almost all of the copies in existence are being saved and kept in good condition .
The real value of your comics is what you get out of reading them , so buy what you want to read , and keep what you want to read again sometime — which ties into the second reason that some comics are valuable : because they ’re good stories that people remember and still want to read .
Your comics are not worth a thousand dollars each .
You bought them in 1993 and so did literally a million other people .
You have all kept them in near - mint condition .
I guess I should n’t be surprised that you do n’t understand basic economics , though , because as an adult you still think the “ investment ” you made as a 10 - year - old was a sound one .
What ’s the worst misconception about comic books and their fans ?
That comics are a genre of story , rather than anything less than every different genre of story .
There are people who say they do n’t like comics , and they ’re wrong .
This is more like saying “ I do n’t like music ” than “ I do n’t like rock music . ”
Sequential art is infinitely diverse , and this goes for the fans , too , because for every different type of person there is some form of sequential art that will appeal to them , whether they ’ve been exposed to it or not .
You can call it the funnies or you can call it a graphic novel , but you like comics .
You do .
Why is there such a big crossover between comic book fans and tech junkies ?
Well , I guess because they ’re adults with their own money to spend on entertainment .
Comics may be a necessity for a sad sack like me , but for almost everyone else they ’re an indulgence , an expensive addiction .
Same as new gadgets for the tech junkies .
Although unlike the latest tech , your comics actually become cooler as they get older , instead of obsolete .

Can the natural process of aging wine in corked bottles be accelerated ?
I recently found an interesting article on how an electric field can be used for maturation of wine ( New Scientist news coverage of the article ) .
Applying a AC field of 600 V / cm for 3 minutes resulted in an accelerated aging of wine and according to the authors of the paper , it made “ harsh and pungent raw wine become harmonious and dainty ” .
They observed changes in concentrations of higher alcohols , aldehydes , esters and free amino acids .
But I was quite surprised that they do n’t say anthing about astringency and polyphenols ( tannins ) .
I ’d expect some changes there as well , but alas it ’s so much more difficult to measure the polyphenols than the low molecular compounds .
A sensory panel identified both positive and negative effects of the electric treatment which helped identify an optimum treatment .
Apparently several Chinese wine manufacturers are testing the technology on a pilot scale now .
Many people have a romantic impression of how wine is made , but the extensive catalogues of “ corrective chemicals ” available to the modern wine maker should perhaps make you reconsider the romatic idea of wine making .
Even professor Hervé Alexandre at the University of Burgundy has given the technology a thumbs up : “ Using an electric field to accelerate ageing is a feasible way to shorten maturation times and improve the quality of young wine ” .
Who knows – maybe you ’ll soon be drinking a wine that has been zapped ?
Moving from industrial scale wine upgrading to kitchen scale gadgets :
In his latest “ curious cook ” column Harold McGee writes about different gadgets that supposedly can change the flavor of wines .
To the better of course .
He mentions the Wine wand which is supposed to speed up aeration of wines .
The promotional explanation on the web page sounds quite dubious , take for instance the claim that the wine wand can “ accelerate the aerating process of wine by replicating the natural frequencies of air and oxygen , and infusing them into the wine ” .
Complete nonsense !
Harold McGee however mentions that he did several blind tests and found that there were differences .
I guess we ca n’t exclude the possiblity that there could be some kind of reactive surface on these wands .
From the pictures there seem to be some small ( glass ? ) beads in a hollow cylinder .
I ca n’t find any information about the surface .
Perhaps it ’s been activated or coated with a metal ?
In that case we could have plenty of surface chemistry going on .
If it ’s only glass however – well – then I ’d just leave the wine to mature in it ’s glass bottle .
The other object he mentions is the Clef du Vin or wine key which is more interesting from a chemical perspective .
The active part consists of a metal disc which ( in a preferred embodiment to quote the patent jargon ) consists of 95 % copper , 3 % gold and 2 % silver .
According to the description in the patent application , the device is capable of an “ accelerated and gauged oxidation - reduction of the wine ” .
Dipping the disc into a glas of wine for one second is supposed to equal one year of cellar aging .
Metals can catalyze many reactions , and there are many reactive compounds in wine so I would n’t be surprised if something happens .
Considering the fact that sulfurous compounds ( such as hydrogensulfide for instance ) are very potent , and that sulfur has an affinity to several metals such as gold , copper and silver it seems plausible that the metal disc may actually remove some sulfides from the wine by adsorption and in turn influence the flavor .
However , in the course of one second only a small fraction of the wine has been in contact with the metal disc , so I ca n’t really see how this should be sufficient .
It would in a way be strange if only desirable reactions are catalyzed ( i.e. only undesirable compounds are degraded / removed ) .
Anyhow – I ’d really like to see a peer reviewed paper on this .
For someone with spare time and access to a GC - MS this should be a nice project 🙂
A stainless steel “ soap ” is believed to remove garlic stains from your fingers
Interestingly there is a totally different product that relies on the same chemistry : the steel soap .
It is typically shaped like a standard soap bar and consists of plain normal stainless steel .
It ’s supposed to remove garlic , onion and fish smell from your fingers .
It works by rubbing your hands against it under running water .
I have one , but to be honest it ’s hard to really say if it works or not – perhaps some have more experience with it ?
I had a friend of mine analyze my stainless steel soap by XPS and he gave me the following elemental composition for the six most abundant elements : 70.6 % iron , 18.5 % chromium , 8.2 % nickel , 1.4 % manganese , 0.7 % molybdenum and 0.3 % copper .
This is more commonly known as 18/8 steel where 18 denotes 18 % chromium and 8 denotes 8 % nickel and it ’s what all your forks and knives and other stainless steel tools are made of ( which of course means that just about any stainless steel object you have in the kitchen should serve the purpose to remove odor from your fingers ) .
Of the metals present here molybdenum in particular is used industrially for desulfurization of oil .
Based on a paper on hydrodesulfurization I speculate whether the mechanism could be something like this :
A proposed mechanism for desulfurization on the surface of a “ steel soap ”
A sulfur compound exemplified here with a thiol ( R - SH ) reacts with the steel soap surface and the S - H bond is cleaved .
Then the S - C bond is cleaved homolytically to yield radical species .
The alkyl radical abstracts hydrogen from the surface and escapes whereas sulfur remains bound to the surface .
The surface could be regenerated by removal of sulfur with hydrogen .
All in all the chemistry of a steel soap seems plausible to me , but I ’m not sure whether the effect is significant effect when it comes to removing that garlic smell from my fingers .

Ten - year - old girls are ready for marriage , according to Saudi Arabia 's most senior cleric .
Sheikh Abdul - Aziz Al Sheikh , the country 's grand mufti , told Al Hayat newspaper that those saying ten or 12 - year - old girls are too young to marry are being ' unfair ' to them .
Al Sheikh 's comments come at a time when Saudi human rights groups have been pushing the government to put an end to marriages involving the very young and to define a minimum age for marriage .
In the past few months , Saudi newspapers have highlighted several cases in which young girls were married off to much older men or very young boys .
Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al - Asheikh , the Kingdom 's grand mufti , prays during the funeral of the Saudi woman and her daughter last February
Though the mufti's pronouncements are respected and provide guidance , the government is not legally bound by them .
On Sunday , the government - run Human Rights Commission condemned marriages of minor girls , saying such marriages are an ' inhumane violation ' and rob children of their rights .
The commission 's statement followed a ruling by a court in Oneiza in central Saudi Arabia last month that dismissed a divorce petition by the mother of an eight - year - old girl whose father married her off to a man in his 50s .
Newspaper reports said the court argued that the mother did not have the right to file such a case on behalf of her daughter and said that the petition should be filed by the girl when she reaches puberty .
Responding to a question about parents who force their underage daughters to marry , the mufti said : ' We hear a lot about the marriage of underage girls in the media , and we should know that Islamic law has not brought injustice to women . '
The mufti said a good upbringing will make a girl capable of carrying out her duties as a wife and that those who say women should not marry before the age of 25 are following a ' bad path ' .
' Our mothers and before them , our grandmothers , married when they were barely 12 , ' said Al Sheikh , according to the Al - Hayat newspaper .
There are no statistics to show how many marriages involving children are performed in Saudi Arabia every year .
It is also not clear whether these unions are on the rise or whether people are hearing about them more now because of the prevalence of media outlets and easy access to the Internet .
Activists say the girls are given away in return for hefty dowries or as a result of long - standing custom in which a father promises his infant daughters and sons to cousins out of a belief that marriage will protect them from illicit relationships .
Portuguese Church : ' Think twice about marrying Muslims '
Meanwhile the head of the Catholic Church in Portugal is advising Portuguese women to think twice before marrying a Muslim .
Cardinal Jose Policarpo says Christians should learn more about Islam and respect Muslims .
But he says marrying a Muslim man can bring ' a whole lot of trouble ' because Christian women become subject to Muslim conventions .
Policarpo insists the Portuguese church has warm relations with the country 's Muslim population of around 100,000 .
Policarpo's comments were made at a public debate late Tuesday and were broadcast by local media Wednesday .
There is no recent history of animosity between Christians and Muslims in Portugal , where 85 percent of people say they are Catholic .
The Animal Legal Defense Fund is celebrating their annual Justice For Animals
Week by asking people to partake in a new , specific action for animals every day this week .
[ social_buttons ]
For the first day , they ’re asking people to help spread the word by telling friends on Facebook , Twitter , and elsewhere to visit their site to partake in the next six actions .
But most importantly , the organization says they hope to add 10,000 signatures to the Animal Bill of Rights during this week alone .
The petition to enact the bill of rights already has over 257,000 supporters .
It does n’t ask for much — only the basic rights that every living being should have :
The Right of animals to be free from exploitation , cruelty , neglect , and abuse .
The Right of laboratory animals not to be used in cruel or unnecessary experiments .
The Right of farm animals to an environment that satisfies their basic physical and psychological needs .
The Right of companion animals to a healthy diet , protective shelter , and adequate medical care .
The Right of wildlife to a natural habitat , ecologically sufficient to a normal existence and self - sustaining species population .
The Right of animals to have their interests represented in court and safeguarded by the law of the land .
The organization has chosen a mascot for the week — a cat named Adam who was horribly burned by two teenage girls when he was only eight weeks old .

UPDATE :
Yesterday , the Swedish government decided to come up with its own bailout package of the Swedish car companies Volvo and Saab , who are owned by Ford and GM respectively .
The package consist of SEK 25 billion in subsidized loans and SEK 3 billion in a direct hand - out to research intended to develop more " green " cars .
There is no question that it will pass , as for one thing the opposition Social Democrats favor the bailout too , and for another , in Sweden , the members of parliament are expected ( and almost always do ) to vote as their party leader orders them .
And no such thing as " filibuster " exists in the Swedish parliament .
By contrast , U.S. Senators and Representatives often vote independently of what Bush and Obama tells them to .
And in the Senate there is a " filibuster " rule which requires 60 out of 100 Senators to get a vote on a certain issue , enabling a minority to block certain proposals .
A majority in the U.S. Senate do favor a bailout of Detroit car companies , but the majority is not big enough to break the " filibuster " .
Republicans are , sensibly enough , insisting that any loans must be coupled with demands of significant wage cuts to achieve parity with the pay level in Japanese - owned car factories , something the Democrats refuse to agree on .
The Democrats would have loved to wait until next year , after Obama and the new Congress ( with a significantly enlarged Democratic majority in the Senate ) are inaugurated , but GM and Chrysler are not likely to survive for six more weeks .
So what will happen now ?
I do n't know , but there appears to be three possibilities :
1) Senators get so scared by a market sell - off today and in the coming days , that enough of them change their mind to get it passed , similar to what happened to the financial company bailout earlier this year .
That would likely be coupled to some concessions from Democrats with regard to reduced labor costs .
2 ) The White House follows the suggestion of Democrats and lets GM and Chrysler tap funds from the " Troubled Asset Relief Program " ( aka the Wall Street bailout funds ) , something which they have been opposed to until now .
This will keep them alive until the enlarged Democratic majority is inaugurated .
3 ) GM and Chrysler are sent into Chapter 11 .
That would in my view be the best solution .
That would most likely not mean that all their operations would end , but shareholders would lose all their money , and creditors would lose some of what they have lent , while the excessive UAW contracts could be thrown out .
Scenario number 2 now looks most likely to become reality
This girl is so conflicted , so photoshopped , and soooo hot .

A little trick I like to use to make my days much more pleasant is to find little , simple pleasures and sprinkle them throughout my day .
They ’re not big things , but they each simple pleasure can translate to a great day if you use them right .
So in the morning , I might have a cup of coffee , and sip it slowly to enjoy it fully .
I might read a gripping novel , and revel in the world of fiction .
I might watch the sun come up , and marvel at the world in pastel hues .
For breakfast , I might put berries on my cereal … and I just love berries .
I savor each one , closing my eyes .
In the shower , I might also close my eyes , and just let the cool water run over me ( I live on a tropical island , so cool water is a nice thing ) .
You get the idea — these are little things , and do n’t really cost a thing ( or not much , anyway ) , but they are tremendously satisfying .
I ’ve just described some of the things I might do to start off my day , but the possibilities are endless , and can be done throughout the day .
I thought it would be fun to compile a list of simple pleasures , to give you all some ideas of what I mean , and to spark other ideas of your own .
Of course , you can probably come up with a thousand more , and it should also be noted that one person ’s pleasures are n’t always pleasures for others .

Sean Hannity went off the deep end with this video montage that portrays the end of America as we know it .
He does n't mention that we 're in the aftermath of the Bush years that have left the country and President Obama no choice but to act swiftly to try and turn the tide of devastation in their wake .
I have n't been able to watch Hannity 's show since Alan Colmes left .
I tried a few times , but I could n't make it .
His Sunday shows called Hannity 's America were bad enough .
And he 's destroying the meaning of the word " America . "
In the end it 's just the typical model of Konservatism Unleashed !
Hannity : Day number twenty nine of Socialism you can believe in .
The new America ... A liberal hijacking of the American way of life .
This is too much .
Since the Republicans are out of power , FOX News has pulled back the curtain to reveal itself without any restrictions whatsoever and has not left a stone unturned in its quest to undermine president Obama 's stimulus bill .
They pepper a segment here and there with the use of their token liberals and democratic analysts still under contract .
It 's a 24 hour propaganda mill of lies and distortions like never before .
This putrid attempt at originality makes it painfully evident that the Sean Hannity film school is located at the Jerry Falwell / Pat Robertson Institute of direct to VHS movies .
The music sounds like it came from one of those Army recruiting commercials .
We Are What We Do Not Automate
For a while I ’ve been keeping a mental list of things I used to have to do myself that technology now does for me .
Like : stamp envelopes , wash dishes , pay bills .
But nothing snaps the encroachment of technology into focus like buying a car .
A few months ago , I bought a new car – my first new car , ever , actually – a 2009 Mini Cooper S. And the differences are stunning .
Here ’s a list of things my new car does for me that I used to have to do myself .
Change gears .
Okay , automatic transmissions are not new , but this one ’s the best I ’ve ever used .
Fast , tight , fun .

Roll down the windows without turning a crank .
( Also not new , but new to me .
One of my favorite little touches : Holding down the unlock button on the key fob from outside the car unlocks all the doors , rolls down both front windows , and cracks open the sunroof . )

Unlock the door without a key .
We opted for a keyless entry system , and it ’s like living in the future .
You just walk up to the car with your keys in your pocket .
Tap a button on the door handle and the door magically unlocks .
Get in and hit the ignition button and the car ’s running .

Turn on the headlights and darken the rearview mirror when it gets dark .
and when it gets dark .
Turn on the windshield wipers when it rains .
You have to tap a control to turn on the automatic wipers , but once they ’re on , they adjust to the speed of the rain , and even stop when the rain stops .

Change a tire .
The car does n’t change its own tires , but it does n’t need to : it has run -flat tires .
It did n’t even come with a jack or a spare .
And then there are the things that I do n’t have to experience anymore :
My head touching the ceiling when sitting normally .
Getting a static shock every damn time I got out of the car .
The tyranny of the alarm going of just because I opened the hatchback .
There ’s a scene in one of the Star Trek movies – the one with the whales – when the crew winds up back in the 1980s .
Scotty needs to use an old Macintosh computer .
He looks at it and says , “ Computer , respond . ”
When it does n’t , he picks up the mouse and yells into it .
“ Computer , respond ! ”
It ’s played for laughs in the movie , and it is funny , but it occurs to me that it might not be that far off .
In a couple months of driving the new car , I ’m already so used to these automations that I keep forgetting to shift or turn on my lights when I drive the old car .
I do n’t lament this technological encroachment – I love it .
Having the car take care of little things like adjusting the windshiled wipers frees me to focus on the fun part : driving .
As as much as the car does automatically , it ’s interesting to see which bits the designers left manual .
To adjust the seat up or down requires pumping a lever .
And the Mini is known for its excessive use of toggle switches on the dash .
All of these things make the car feel tactile , mechanical , and under control , even though I ’m doing less to control it .
In the near future , interaction design will be as much about sculpting technological interactions as it is about deciding which parts to leave unautomated .
Just imagine what things we do today that , someday , we ’ll be amazed we ever did without technology .
Minnesota Court Orders Examining 4800 Absentee Ballots
The court overseeing the Minnesota recount ruled yesterday that 4800 disputed absentee ballots must be verified to see if they are valid .
This is a big victory for Norm Coleman since with so many ballots in play , he might pick up the 226 votes he needs to win .
Robin Carnahan Announces for the Senate Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan ( D ) has announced yesterday that she is running for the open Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Kit Bond ( R ) . Carnahan had no choice .
It is in her blood .
Dad ( Mel Carnahan ) was governor of Missouri .
Mom ( Jean Carnahan ) was ( an appointed ) senator .
Brother Russ Carnahan is a U.S. representative from MO - 03 .
Needless to say the Carnahan name is well known in Missouri and she is a shoo - in for the Democratic nomination ( unless she gets into a primary fight with her brother ) .
But Missouri is full of nice people and attacking your sister is considered poor form .
Probably Robin and Russ flipped a coin to see who got to go after the seat and Robin won .
The Republican nominee is n't known yet but former senator Jim Talent is said to be interested , along with state Treasurer Sarah Steelman and Rep. Roy Blunt .
Hodes Will Run for Gregg 's Seat Representative Paul Hodes ( D - NH ) has announced that he is running for the Senate seat currently occupied by soon - to - be Secretary of Commerce Judd Gregg .
Gov. John Lynch ( D - NH ) named Bonnie Newman , a Republican , to Gregg 's seat , but she is not expected to run in 2010 , leaving an open seat .
Given how blue New Hampshire has become in the past two election cycles , Hodes has an excellent chance of winning the seat -- unless Rep. Carol Shea - Porter ( D - NH ) challenges him to a primary fight .
But the winner of a primary is still in pretty good shape given the way the state has been voting .
Former senator John Sununu might try to get his job back , but the voters kicked him out of office last year and there is little reason to think they now regret their decision .
Daschle Quits Former Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle has withdrawn his candidacy for being Secretary of Health and Human Services after the NY Times called for it yesterday .
What is amazing is that high ranking politicians , of both parties , think they can flout the law and get away with it .
Come to think of , most of the time they do , that 's why it never occurs to them that not paying your taxes might be a problem at a confirmation hearing .
As if that were n't enough , Obama 's pick to be chief performance officer , Nancy Killefer , is also withdrawing when it came out that she did n't pay her taxes on household help .
One would think that transition committees would ask specific questions like : " Have you paid all the taxes you owe ? " and " Have you ever committed a felony ? "
Not to mention asking for all the candidates ' tax returns for at least 10 years .
But that is apparently not how it is done -- or the candidates lie outright .
Minority Groups Worried about Gregg Running the Census As Secretary of Commerce , Judd Gregg will be responsible for making sure everybody is counted in the 2010 census , which will be used as the basis for allocating seats in the House .
Minority groups are worried that Gregg wo n't try very hard to find poor people , transients , and homeless people , thus reducing the representation of states with a lot of them .
Some people have advocated using statistical techniques to estimate the number of people missed , but the constitution calls for an enumeration , not a statistical model , so anything short of an actual count would probably be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court .
Nevertheless , Gregg has a fair amount of discretion about how hard the enumerators try to count difficult - to - count people .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. health authorities told consumers on Saturday to avoid eating products that contain peanut butter until they can determine the scope of an outbreak of salmonella food poisoning that may have contributed to six deaths .
“ We urge consumers to postpone eating any products that may contain peanut butter until additional information becomes available , ” Dr. Stephen Sundlof of the Food and Drug Administration ’s Center for Food Safety said in a teleconference with reporters .
As of now , there is no indication that “ major national name brand jars of peanut butter sold in retail stores are linked ” to bulk supplies of peanut butter and peanut paste recalled for fear of possible contamination , the FDA said in a follow - up statement .
The company at the center of the matter , Peanut Corporation of America , or PCA , said it had been informed by health authorities that some samples of its products had tested positive for a salmonella strain that may have originated in a Blakely , Georgia , peanut processing plant .
The peanut butter and peanut paste recalled by PCA was used by many other manufacturers to make such products as cakes , crackers , candies , cookies and ice cream , the FDA said .
“ In terms of food products which contain peanut butter , but have not yet been recalled , we urge consumers to postpone eating these products until information becomes available about whether that product may be affected , ” an e-mailed statement said .
“ We have been advised by manufacturers that product specific information may be available within the next few days . ”
The FDA is asking companies to check the records of their supply chain and determine if their ingredients came from PCA , and if so , to take “ appropriate precautionary measures . ”
As of Friday night , 474 people had been reported infected by a salmonella outbreak linked to peanut butter by public health authorities in 43 of the 50 U.S. states , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said .
Twenty - three percent of the known cases had resulted in hospitalizations and the infections may have contributed to six deaths , said Dr. Robert Tauxe , deputy director of the Centers ’ division of Foodborne , Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases .
The very young , elderly and immuno - compromised were the most severely affected , he said in the teleconference .
The reported illnesses began in September and 21 cases were reported on Friday .
The recalled peanut butter was sold in containers ranging in size from 5 pounds ( 2.3 kg ) to 1,700 pounds ( 771 kg ) and the peanut paste was sold in sizes ranging from 35 - pound ( 16 - kg ) containers to tanker containers .
None of the peanut butter or peanut paste being recalled so far is sold through retail stores , PCA said .
Kellogg
Co said late on Friday it was recalling certain products that “ have the potential to be contaminated , ” including some Austin and Keebler branded peanut butter snacks and some Famous Amos and Keebler Soft Batch cookies .
TORONTO - Premier Dalton McGuinty is defending a plan to saddle homeowners with a mandatory $ 300 energy audit as part of his Green Energy Act , dismissing critics who say this is yet another way to tax overburdened residents .
Forcing people to conduct audits is a good idea , McGuinty said , because it will allow buyers to know their energy costs .
" When it comes to buying the single most expensive thing that you 're likely to buy during the course of your lifetime -- a home -- you 're entitled to know what kinds of costs you 're going to incur when it comes to energy , " McGuinty said .
" We want to make sure that you can compare one house to another on an apples to apples basis . "
Ontario realtors , however , said the additional costs will hurt homeowners in what are increasingly difficult economic times .
" The results of these audits will be used by home buyers as bargaining chips to significantly reduce the final selling price , " said Gerry Weir , president of the Ontario Real Estate Association .
" Home sellers are already worried about lost equity in their homes .
A move like this , which will reduce their value even further , will not help them in any way . "
The group also notes there is n't one standard for energy audits and no regulation of auditors .
" The question that immediately came to my mind is : what then ?
After you do the energy audit , what happens ? " asked Mel Fruitman of the Consumers Association of Canada .
" Is it to tell you you have to put another $ 20,000 into insulating the house or the government wo n't let you sell it ? "
Progressive Conservative critic John Yakabuski said the mandatory audits will simply mean more stress for homeowners .
" I know all kinds of people in my riding and in various parts of the country where they 're selling their home because they 're forced to sell it because they can no longer make the payments , " he said .
" The cost of having to do a $ 300 , $ 400 , $ 500 energy audit at a time like that amounts to another tax on the sale of their home . "
The Liberal government said it will be up to sellers and buyers to decide who pays for the audit , noting that many aspects of the act are up for debate and improvement .
Energy Minister George Smitherman said the government will continue to provide a $ 150 credit to put toward the audits , since that 's a " really crucial part of the incentive to try to assist people to have that information . "
" It seems to be a pretty good piece of information to know , how much electricity the home is going to use , " Smitherman said .
" If it has the effect of putting some positive emphasis on homes that use relatively less energy , that would seem to be an appropriate reward for the investment that people would make . "
He also dismissed concerns from Progressive Conservative critic Joyce Savoline over provisions in the act that she believes will allow government inspectors freer entrance into homes if they do n't think the audit was done properly .
Savoline said the details on the enforcement of the audits are n't clear , and she wants to know what changes could be in store for homeowners .
" People can be prone to all kinds of wild hyperbole , " Smitherman said .
" This is an example of why we 're about to have a legislative debate about these matters . "
The act , introduced Monday , promises to streamline project approvals , mandate more efficient appliances , and provide low - interest loans to homeowners who wish to build their own small - scale wind or solar projects .
Critics say the legislation can only go so far without specifics such as targets for green energy or a move away from nuclear energy .
nice .
I thought they were stenciled spraypaint at first b/c that 's what I 'm used to .
The stickers would be faster I guess , but they 're not smoothly put on ( I'm guessing timing had to do with it ) .
I 'm wondering though how hard it would be to use spray paint and stencils .
Most of it's not in color , but there 's the shades of gray .
Stencils and spray paint would be harder to track though than giant stickers .
NEW DELHI : India stepped up the pressure on Pakistan on Saturday with a strong signal that it was keeping its military options open .
The message came loud and clear from a four - hour - long meeting in the evening that began at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ’s residence and later shifted to the war room in the defence ministry .
At the meeting , the three service chiefs briefed the Prime Minister and his senior cabinet colleagues on the state of military preparedness .
Sources said Dr Manmohan Singh , defence minister AK Antony , external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister P Chidambaram were among those present .
The meeting in the war room lasted about two hours with the chiefs briefing those present about the state of high alert being maintained by the Army , Air Force and
Navy .
The briefing in the war room is rare and signals the fact that the military option is still very much on the table .
It was preceded by a meeting of the core committee of the ruling United Progressive Alliance front in the 7 Race Course Road residence of the Prime Minister .
In the wake of the Mumbai attacks , the Indian military has gone into a state of high alert , but has not yet taken an offensive posture .
In the meanwhile , there has also been a steady stream of intelligence warnings , from both Indian agencies and foreign countries , about several threats .
Among them are aerial threats to key installations and the possibility of yet another sea - borne attack .
Sources told DNA that home minister Chidambaram has reviewed with the intelligence chiefs and National Security Advisor details of terrorist camps in Pakistan .
Indian agencies are believed to have the exact coordinates of over a dozen of the major terrorist training camps .
As part of the ongoing state of military preparedness , the non-static Army units have been issued over the past couple of days instructions for the highest state of alert within their present locations , asking them to be ready for mobilization .
The units have also been informally instructed to minimize leave during the period .
These units , mostly infantry , artillery and armoured battalions , have started carrying out intensive checks of their mobilisation preparedness .
Simultaneously , India has also summoned all its 120 ambassadorshigh commissioners and other heads of missions from all foreign nations .
They are to be briefed about the Mumbai attacks and its fallouts and the government ’s coercive diplomacy efforts .
It 's best to highlight this government 's attack on liberty rights and privacy with cases where people have been penalised by the government or its agencies when they 've done nothing wrong .
But occasionally it is worth looking at the legislative process because it is the failure of democratic and protective instincts in parliament that are at the root of the crisis of liberty .
I make no apology for reproducing part of an editorial about the Climate Change Act from the subscriber magazine Criminal Law Week .
It 's arcane and it's dry , but it explains exactly what 's going on .
This act is one of the new breed of acts , vast swathes of which exist only in the hypothetic , to be enacted by secondary legislation behind the scenes , with no or minimal parliamentary scrutiny .
What parliament has effectively done is issue the government with a blank cheque in relation to climate change to make provision as it sees fit be that in respect of the criminalisation of the private citizen for failing to leave his rubbish out at the right time or in the right manner , or the penalisation of companies for giving their customers plastic carrier bags ( 13 pages of an act of parliament being devoted to this topic ! ) .
It is difficult to see how parliament could consider such a lack of transparency acceptable .
If you 're looking for an answer to the question – how does Labour make so much law without anyone noticing ?
– and if you want to know how 3,000 new offences have been created , over a third of which carry prison sentences , then you are half way there .
The shocking abuse of secondary legislation , usually referred to by the term " statutory instruments " , is one of the scandals of our time .
Statutory instruments – ministerial diktats by any other name – are a way of making sure that little is debated or scrutinised by MPs .
With their increasing use , power passes from the chamber of the House of Commons and parliamentary committees to ministers and ultimately to senior civil servants , a naturally undemocratic group who think of the public as an awkward managerial problem .
The provisions , which are inserted in a bill and allow the government to amend or repeal the legislation without debate are known as Henry VIII clauses .
With good reason : they were named after Henry VIII 's Statute of Proclamation of 1539 , which gave him the power to make law by proclamation .
There is shameless honesty about this name .
Although today there is theoretically a process of scrutiny , research by Richard Cracknell says most statutory instruments are , in practice , not debated .
Of those that are , the majority are discussed not on the floor of the House of Commons but in a standing committee , after which they are reported to the House and voted on without any further debate .
The crucial point is that the trend is against debate and scrutiny in parliament .
Cracknel 's figures show that the number of acts passed is in decline over the last 30 - 40 years , while the number of statutory instruments has seen a sharp increase .
From around 2,000 a year until the late 1980s to around double that now .
This pattern started under the Conservatives but it took off with Labour .
" While the number of acts has been declining over the last four decades , " writes Cracknell , " the number of pages of acts has tended to increase .
Statutory instruments have grown in number and in terms of the total number of pages . "
MPs either have no power to debate and scrutinise legislation , or there are so many pages of it that proper scrutiny is made impossible .
That is why parliament has lost so much power to the executive ; that is why so many people have the vague feeling that law is being made without debate – pretty much in the manner of a syphilitic 16th century tyrant .
The Conservative MP Edward Garnier told me , " This is legislation made for the convenience of the government and its civil servants , which is wholly impossible to scrutinise in the Commons .
The last few criminal justice bills , eg the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 , the Offender Management Act 2007 , the Identity Cards Act 2006 , are all terrible examples of ' Christmas tree ' bills on to which the government hangs anything that comes to mind and which vaguely fits into some power given a minister by the act . "
Parliament First , an all party group of MPs headed by Mark Fisher , one of the leading democratic voices on the government benches , reported six years ago that parliament was failing " in its political duty to hold the government to account . "
Fisher wrote then that while parliament was the main check and balance on the government , scrutinising and amending legislation , monitoring its actions and providing a public forum for debate , " in practice it has allowed itself to be driven to the margin " .
I fully appreciate that statutory instruments are dull stuff for a blog but that is perhaps the reason why this vitally important story is so little understood .
Cracknells 's figures show that secondary legislation has doubled in the last two decades .
This fact together with the pages of uncharted opportunity in the Climate Change
Act for ministers to issue hundreds of decrees should be enough to persuade us that we cannot hope to sustain our democracy if parliament is not reformed , modernised and made properly accountable to our elected representatives .
The Guardian is the media partner for The Convention on Modern Liberty , taking place on Saturday February 28 2009 , which will debate these and other issues .

I was watching bad TV the other day , and I got bored and started playing with a cool LED pen Thorlabs gave me .
I was also drinking some VS ( the cheap stuff ) Courvoisier cognac .
I was surprised to see fluorescence coming from the cognac when illuminated with the blue LED ( the fluorescence is the greenish glow ) :
I suppose that it should n’t be surprising , given that cognac is so aromatic !
But a visible absorption and green fluorescence is n’t from benzene or something — it ’s from a real fluorophore .
Cool .
So I wonder what fluorophore is in cognac .
I know that coumarin ( general structure above ) is found in some plants , such as cinnamon , and some coumarins absorb in the blue .
And there are a lot of tannins in wooden barrels .
I found these fluorescence spectra of brandy ( B ) , whisky ( W ) , slivovice ( S ) , and juniper spirit ( J ) .
Note that the brandy — cognac is a brandy — does fluoresce in the blue / green .
Growing up as an albino in Canada , Peter Ash had to endure taunts like “ Snowflake ” and “ Snow White . ”
Once , when he was squinting to read a padlock  most albinos have vision problems , too  someone rammed his head into his school locker .
Another time , he was forced to play baseball and never saw the pitch that hit him in the face .
But it was all bearable , he said , because his mother told him God had made him that way .
He grew up to be a Baptist minister , then gave that up to start a finance company in Vancouver that did very well .
Last spring , he said , he began to hear about albinos in Tanzania being murdered for their body parts .
More than 40 have been killed since 2007 , sometimes right in front of their families , by gangs of men who hack off legs , heads or genitals and run away with them .

Sorry , folks , the paper is n’t free .
And the Iraq war is n’t over , at least not yet .
In an elaborate hoax , pranksters distributed thousands of free copies of a spoof edition of The New York Times on Wednesday morning at busy subway stations around the city , including Grand Central Terminal , Washington and Union Squares , the 14th and 23rd Street stations along Eighth Avenue , and Pacific Street in Brooklyn , among others .
The spurious 14 - page papers — with a headline “ IRAQ WAR ENDS ” — surprised commuters , many of whom took the free copies thinking they were legitimate .
The paper is dated July 4 , 2009 , and imagines a liberal utopia of national health care , a rebuilt economy , progressive taxation , a national oil fund to study climate change , and other goals of progressive politics .
The hoax was accompanied by a Web site that mimics the look of The Times ’s real Web site .
A page of the spoof site contained links to dozens of progressive organizations , which were also listed in the print edition .
( A headline in the fake business section declares : “ Public Relations Industry Forecasts a Series of Massive Layoffs . ”
Uh , sure . )
The Associated Press reported that copies of the spoof paper were also handed out in Los Angeles , San Francisco , Chicago , Philadelphia and Washington , and that the pranksters — who included a film promoter , three unnamed Times employees and Steven Lambert , an art professor — financed the paper with small online contributions and created the paper to urge President - elect Barack Obama to keep his campaign promises .
According to The A.P. , software and Internet support were provided by the Yes Men , who were the subject of a 2004 documentary film .
On Wednesday , the Yes Men issued a statement about the prank , stating , in part :
In an elaborate operation six months in the planning , 1.2 million papers were printed at six different presses and driven to prearranged pickup locations , where thousands of volunteers stood ready to pass them out on the street .
Catherine J. Mathis , a Times spokeswoman , said : “ This is obviously a fake issue of The Times .
We are in the process of finding out more about it . ”
Alex S. Jones , director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School , and a co-author of “ The Trust , ” a history of the family that controls The Times , said in a telephone interview that the paper should be flattered by the spoof .
“ I would say if you ’ve got one , hold on to it , ” Mr. Jones , a former Times reporter , said of the fake issue .
“ It will probably be a collector ’s item .
I ’m just glad someone thinks The New York Times print edition is worthy of an elaborate hoax .
A Web spoof would have been infinitely easier .
But creating a print newspaper and handing it out at subway stations ?
That takes a lot of effort . ”
He added , “ I consider this a gigantic compliment to The Times . ”
There is a history of spoofs and parodies of The Times .
Probably the best - known is one unveiled two months into the 1978 newspaper strike .
A whole cast of characters took part in that parody , including the journalist Carl Bernstein , the author Christopher Cerf , the humorist Tony Hendra and the Paris Review editor George Plimpton .
And for April Fool ’s Day in 1999 , the British business executive Richard Branson printed 100,000 copies of a parody titled “ I Ca n’t Believe It ’s Not The New York Times . ”
A 27 - year - old Princeton alumnus named Matthew Polly , operating a “ guerrilla press ” known as Hard Eight Publishing , edited that 32 - page spoof of the newspaper .
The referendum could allow Hugo Chavez to run again in 2012
Venezuela has expelled a Spanish deputy of the European parliament , over reports that he called President Hugo Chavez a dictator .
Luis Herrero had also criticised a decision to keep polling stations open two hours longer than normal in a referendum to be held on Sunday .
The referendum is on a proposal to remove all term limits on elected officials , including Mr Chavez .
Mr Herrero had been invited to observe the vote by an opposition party .
The Spanish deputy , who represents the conservative Popular Party , was put on a commercial flight to Brazil late on Friday , Venezuelan officials said .
Earlier , in comments to journalists , he had invited Venezuelans to vote freely .
" They should never be carried away when they vote by the fear that a dictator tries to impose in a premeditated way , " AFP news agency quoted him as saying .
The president of Venezuela 's National Elections Council , Tibisay Lucena , said Mr Herrero should leave the country for making " offensive statements " over a decision to keep polling stations open for two extra hours .
He also said Mr Herrero had disturbed the " peace and harmony " that had so far marked the referendum campaign .
Mr Chavez celebrated 10 years in power earlier this month .
He said the past decade could be summed up as " revolution , independence and socialism " .

Carpe diem on any duplicate content worries : we now support a format that allows you to publicly specify your preferred version of a URL .
If your site has identical or vastly similar content that 's accessible through multiple URLs , this format provides you with more control over the URL returned in search results .
It also helps to make sure that properties such as link popularity are consolidated to your preferred version .
Let 's take our old example of a site selling Swedish fish .
Imagine that your preferred version of the URL and its content looks like this :
However , users ( and Googlebot ) can access Swedish fish through multiple ( not as simple ) URLs .
Even if the key information on these URLs is the same as your preferred version , they may show slight content variations due to things like sort parameters or category navigation :
Or they have completely identical content , but with different URLs due to things such as a tracking parameters or a session ID : Now , you can simply add thistag to specify your preferred version : inside thesection of the duplicate content URLs : and Google will understand that the duplicates all refer to the canonical URL :.
Additional URL properties , like PageRank and related signals , are transferred as well .
This standard can be adopted by any search engine when crawling and indexing your site .
Of course you may have more questions .
Joachim Kupke , an engineer from our Indexing Team , is here to provide us with the answers :
It 's a hint that we honor strongly .
We 'll take your preference into account , in conjunction with other signals , when calculating the most relevant page to display in search results .
Yes , relative paths are recognized as expected with thetag .
Also , if you include alink in your document , relative paths will resolve according to the base URL .
We allow slight differences , e.g. , in the sort order of a table of products .
We also recognize that we may crawl the canonical and the duplicate pages at different points in time , so we may occasionally see different versions of your content .
All of that is okay with us .
We 'll continue to index your content and use a heuristic to find a canonical , but we recommend that you specify existent URLs as canonicals .
Like all public content on the web , we strive to discover and crawl a designated canonical URL quickly .
As soon as we index it , we 'll immediately reconsider the rel= " canonical " hint .
Yes , you can specify a URL that redirects as a canonical URL .
Google will then process the redirect as usual and try to index it .
Our algorithm is lenient :
We can follow canonical chains , but we strongly recommend that you update links to point to a single canonical page to ensure optimal canonicalization results .
Update on 12/17/2009 : The answer is yes !
We now support a cross- domain rel= " canonical " link element .
Previous answer below :
No .
To migrate to a completely different domain , permanent ( 301 ) redirects are more appropriate .
Google currently will take canonicalization suggestions into account across subdomains ( or within a domain ) , but not across domains .
So site owners can suggestvs.vs. , but notvs .
Yes , wikia.com helped us as a trusted tester .
For example , you 'll notice that the source code on the URLspecifies its rel= " canonical " as :
The two URLs are nearly identical to each other , except that Nelvana_Limited , the first URL , contains a brief message near its heading .
It 's a good example of using this feature .
With rel= " canonical " , properties of the two URLs are consolidated in our index and search results display wikia.com 's intended version .
Feel free to ask additional questions in our comments below .
And if you 're unable to implement a canonical designation link , no worries ; we 'll still do our best to select a preferred version of your duplicate content URLs , and transfer linking properties , just as we did before : this link - tag is currently also supported by Ask.com Microsoft Live Search and Yahoo !

NEW YORK / WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - An 85 - year - old former U.S. Army employee pleaded guilty on Tuesday to acting as an unregistered agent of Israel and admitted he gave classified documents to the Jewish state in the 1980s .
Court documents show the defendant , Ben -Ami Kadish , reported to the same handler as Jonathan Pollard , an American who spied for Israel in the 1980s and triggered a scandal that rocked U.S. - Israeli relations .
Kadish ’s plea indicates the Israeli spy network that obtained U.S. nuclear secrets through Pollard spread further than previously acknowledged .
It comes as the Bush administration considers a new request by Pollard for a commutation of his life sentence .
Prosecutors say Ben - Ami Kadish provided classified documents , including some relating to U.S. missile defense systems , to an Israeli agent , Yosef Yagur , who photographed the documents at Kadish ’s residence .
Yagur was one of Pollard ’s handlers , according to court documents .
From 1980 to 1985 , Yagur asked Kadish to obtain classified documents , which Kadish retrieved from the U.S. Army ’s Picatinny Arsenal in Dover , New Jersey , according to Kadish ’s sworn statement .
Pollard , a former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst , is serving life in prison term after pleading guilty to spying for Israel in 1986 .
His case has led Jews in the United States and Israel to plea for clemency and a new request by Pollard is under Bush administration review .
Israel gave Pollard citizenship in 1996 and acknowledged he was one of its spies in 1998 .
Though the United States and Israel are close allies , the Pollard case revealed how the thirst for intelligence trumped that friendship .
Kadish , a Connecticut - born U.S. citizen , faces a maximum of five years in prison at his February 13 sentencing in federal court in Manhattan but it is possible he will not serve any time .
Sentencing guidelines call for a maximum of six months and prosecutors said they would not oppose a sentence without jail time , according to his plea agreement .
He had been free on bail since shortly after his arrest in April on four counts of conspiracy and espionage as a result of an investigation that began in 2005 .
The Israeli embassy had no immediate comment .
Kadish used his security clearance to borrow 50 to 100 classified documents from the arsenal ’s library , including some “ concerning nuclear weaponry ” and others relating to a modified version of an F - 15 fighter jet that the United States had sold to an unidentified country , the complaint said .
A third pertained to the U.S. Patriot missile air defense system .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
At least nine protesters were arrested in a pro-Palestinian rally Sunday afternoon in New York that injured seven police officers , authorities said .
Seven police officers were injured Sunday in New York City during a pro-Palestinian rally .
The extent of injuries varied from minor to serious , New York police said .
Two officers sustained head injuries .
Detective Cheryl Crispin said the protesters taken into custody faced charges ranging from disorderly conduct to reckless endangerment .
In a statement , the NYPD said the officers were injured when trying to break up a fight between two demonstrators .
" While attempting to separate the males , several others joined in and began to assault the officers , " the statement said .
The demonstrators had gathered on Manhattan 's West Side on Sunday afternoon to protest the Israeli incursion in Gaza .
The rally began peacefully , but skirmishes between police and demonstrators eventually broke out , witnesses said .
iReport.com : Hundreds march , shout at rally
Steve Sherman , coordinator of security for United for Peace and Justice and a demonstrator at the rally , said police maced demonstrators .
" The police pushed us out onto the avenue , and as we were walking down the avenue ... they charged with horses on the sidewalks and they charged with their own bodies and pushed in , and a riot started , " he said .
Mike Eilenfeldt , another demonstrator , said confrontations between the police and protesters appeared to escalate after a police officer had fallen to the ground .
" He 's laying on the street , and from that point on it's a police riot where they start attacking the young people , " Eilenfeldt told CNN .
Police denied the allegations of mace being used on protesters .

UFO at Obama Inauguration ( VIDEO )
Speculation is running rampant after a CNN news clip of 's inauguration aired showing an unidentified flying object zipping across the plaza in front of the Washington Monument .
The video has many wondering ... is it a bird , a plane or a UFO ?
Well I 'm no expert on UFOs or super - secret military aircraft , however , I do know that optical illusions can make you think a lot of things .
Although it was originally reported that the shadowy object flies behind the monument , on closer inspection it clearly flies in front of the monument , which means it probably is n't at large as it appears in the video clip , and depending on the camera angle , could be going much slower than it looks as well .
So here is my expert opinion ... bird .
You can watch the CNN video clip below and come to your own conclusion .
The UFO appears at the 11 second mark on the right hand side , zips in front of the Washington Monument and disappears into the clouds .
The original CNN video is provided below , however , from time to time the video is experiencing errors , so we have provided a YouTube copy as well .

ときどき 、
「 会社は社員から搾り取ることばかりで、社員のことを何も考えてない」とか「従業員をサービス残業させて搾取している」とか、
つまるとこ ろ 「自分たちは苦労してるのに、重役達は楽して良い思いしている。むかつく！」みたいなエントリーを読むと、
だったら自分で会社作って、社長になったらいいんちゃう？と素で思うんですが、そういうもんじゃないのかなぁ。
文句を言うな、とかそういうことじゃないんです。
文句を言っている暇があったら行動を起こして、状況変えちゃった方が早くないっすか？と思うのです。
自分たちだけ良い思いをする社長がうらやましい（憎たらしい）なら、自分も社長になって同じことをすればいいし、
会社にいたいなら縦横のつながり作って、自分自身も売り上げあげて、発言力持って、会社を変えちゃえばいいんじゃん？と。
なんしか、方法はたくさんあって、気にくわないところがあればやればいいと思うんだけど、
ただ、文句や不満を言うのは、あんまり状況が変わらないことが多いから意味ないんじゃないかなーと思うんす。
そんなことを思ってるさなかに、このエントリー（とブックマークコメント）を読んでちょっと昔のことを思い出した。
・ 404 Blog Not Found : バイキング式のレストランで給仕を待つ君たちへ
・はてなブックマーク - 404 Blog Not Found : バイキング式のレストランで給仕を待つ君たちへ
連想で思い出したので、引用元とは違う話になっちゃいます。
ちょっと昔の話。今よりも僕はずっとずっと言い訳をするのが好きで、理屈を説明するのが好きだったんです。
でまぁ、当時も今と変わらずモテませんで、
男友達と飲みながら「出会いがない、だから彼女ができないんだ」と文句言ってたのです。 新宿で。 したらまた、この友達が「じゃあ、わかった」と言うのです。「今からナンパに行こう」と。
ナンパなんかしたことないオレは焦りました。「いや、ちょっと待って」とあわてます。
でも友達は、少し遠くで飲んでいる2人組の女性を指さし、「あそこ行って一緒に飲もうぜ」と言い、席を立ちます。 オレは「いや、向こうも迷惑だし」とか「さすがにうざいっしょ」とか言って止めます。 友達は「嫌がられたら戻ってくればいいんだよ」と言ってましたが、オレが動こうとしないので行くのをやめました。
「じゃあ、店出て、外歩いている人誘うか？」と友達は言います。
「逆にそっちの方が難易度高いだろ」とオレは顔をしかめます。
「 でも出会いがないんだろ？ だったら作るしかないだろ」と友達は口調を強めます。
「そうだけど、もっと普通に知り合いたいっていうか」とオレ。
「 なに、普通って？ 」 「 友達の紹介とか、同じ学校とか、そういう…」とハッキリ言えない自分。
「じゃあ、オレが今からナンパしてきて、それでお前に紹介したらいいか？
それも友達の紹介だよな」という友達。 「それは…、だけど、ほら、お前もこの前言ってたじゃん。ナンパでついてくる子って軽い子が多いとか 」 「 は？ 」 「 その … 」 「… 軽い子じゃねぇよ。ノリが良い子だよ 」 「 あ、そうだったね。…でもオレ、ノリの良い子、少し苦手だし。そこまでして出会いが欲しいってわけでもないし… 」
友達はオレの顔をじっと見つめながら、一言、 「 だせぇ 」 と言いました 。
「 できない」と言われると、カッとなって「ホントにそうか？」と言いたくなる
だから何かにつけて言い訳をする人を見ると「傷つきたくないからやだなーって思ってる部分があるんだろな」って思ったりします。
でも、自分もそうだったから「だせぇ」とはあまり思わずに、どうしたら勇気が持てるようになるか、力になれないかって考えたりします。
僕の友達がやったような荒療治がいいときもあるだろし、
ゆっくりと一緒に解決した方がいいときもあると思うし。
正直なところ 、
言い訳したり、あら探しをしたりしながら今の自分を守って、それで70、80まで生きてもいいと思うんです。
イヤミとかそういうんじゃなくて、それもひとつの生き方だと思うし。
ただ個人的には、欲しいモノはなんとしてでも手に入れるべきと思ってるのと、
勇気が出ないっていう本音をカモフラージュしながら何十年も言い訳をしつづけるのは、考えただけでげんなりするので、
できない理由を考える暇があるなら、できることだけでもやってしまった方がいいと思うし、そっちをおすすめしたいんです。
「 それができない人もいる」という意見は、とてもよくわかるんだけど、最近はわからないフリしてる。
ホントにそうか？って思う。
なぁなぁ、ホントにできないか？ できない理由って具体的になんだ。それに対してこれまで行った対応策はなんだ。
意外と具体的には言えなくて「なんとなくできない気がしてる」だけのときってあるし、
突き詰めてみると、 「 それって勇気を出して一歩踏み出せば解決するんじゃん？」ってことが案外あったりすると思ってるんです。
The rightwing Israeli opposition leader , Binyamin Netanyahu , today appeared increasingly likely to become the country 's next prime minister after winning the key endorsement of a far - right politician .
Avigdor Lieberman , whose party , Israel Our Home , came a strong third in last week 's general elections , met the Israeli president , Shimon Peres , and told him he would support Netanyahu to lead a new coalition government .
He said he preferred to see Netanyahu lead a broad , national unity government but added that he would join even a narrow rightwing cabinet .
Even though Netanyahu , leader of the Likud party , came a close second in the elections , he has been favoured to become prime minister because the success of other rightwing parties means he could put together a majority coalition government far more easily than his rival Tzipi Livni .
Livni , the foreign minister and Kadima party leader , won the vote by just one seat .
She took 28 seats , just ahead of Netanyahu on 27 .
Lieberman won 15 seats , turning him effectively into a kingmaker , but – as expected – no one party came anywhere close to a majority in the 120 - seat Knesset , meaning the next prime minister would again have to rely on a coalition .
Yesterday , Peres began discussions with all the elected parties and , based on their recommendations , will choose which MP will be given the chance of forming a coalition and becoming prime minister .
A new government is not likely to be established for at least another month .
The Ha'aretz newspaper website quoted Lieberman as telling Peres that he saw three possibilities : " A broad government , which is what we want .
" A narrow government , that will be a government of paralysis , but we do n't rule out sitting in it .
And the third option is going to elections , which will achieve nothing . "
Two smaller rightwing parties have said they will endorse Netanyahu .
He is expected to win the support of others , which should give him at least a 65 - seat coalition .
The key question now will be whether he can convince Livni and her Kadima party to join his government to provide it with more stability .
Livni has argued that , since she won the election , she should become the prime minister , and it is not clear if she would serve under a Netanyahu leadership .
Some in her party said they would prefer to go into opposition , although Kadima , which is barely three years old , has never been in opposition before .
Two possible Livni allies , the Labour party and the leftwing Meretz party , said they would not offer any endorsement for prime minister , which undermined her chances even further .
Ehud Barak , the current defence minister and head of Labour , said his party was heading into opposition .
" Our only option is to refrain from recommending anyone , " he told a party meeting .
" The picture is clear , and we are going to the opposition .
In this reality , in my opinion , there is just one possibility – not to recommend any of the candidates for prime minister . "
Peres was due to finish consulting with party leaders later today , and will then announce who will be given the chance to form the next government .
The US Senator John Kerry and two Democratic congressmen , Brian Baird , of Washington , and Keith Ellison , of Minnesota , were due to travel to Gaza today to see the situation there for themselves after Israel 's war last month .
They were to meet UN officials , but no meetings with any Hamas figures were scheduled .
It follows a visit by a group of British Labour party MPs earlier this week .
And now , a fascinating piece from the Daily Express about the dangers of drinking too much coffee .
Just seven cups a day is enough to " make you hallucinate and sense dead people " , reports Richard Desmond 's paper .
Except Monkey 's not sure exactly how interesting the Express thinks this is .
We only mention this after catching sight of the URL at the top of the story , which ends with the immortal phrase " utter- cock -as-usual " .
Maybe it 's a search engine optimisation thing .
Or maybe not .
Monkey update :
It turns out the unfortunate URL of the story was not written in Express Towers after all .
As Monkey 's Uncle has written to point out , anyone can add anything they like to most URLs and the server still displays the story .
So , possibly the work of an Express fan ( or Ben Goldacre ) with too much time on their hands ... and after too many cups of coffee .
These protests are at the moment quiet , but in Umm al Fahm , the mayor had to speak to rioting youths at the entrance to the city .
Police used teargas and stun grenades to control the crowds .
Also in the north at the Der Al - assad junction , police dispersed a demonstration using water hoses .
Police also arrested 12 youths suspected of throwing stoning near the village of Kfar Kana .
Some of the youths were masked .
And east Jerusaalem arabs threw stones and molotov cocktails at Border Police officers at the Shufat Refugee camp .
Four suspects were arrested .
Three residents of east Jerusaelm were arrested for hurling rocks at police .
In the West Bank , a Palestinain was shot dead by IDF troops and two others wounded during a violent protest in the village of Naalin , near Ramallah .
Residents said protestors hurled rocks at the Israeli soldiers .
An IDF spokesman said troops stationed near the village were attacked with an hail of rocks and only used live ammunition after other crowd control methods failed to halt the barrage .
The spokesman said the incident was being investigated by military authorities .
Near Bidu , near the security fence , dozens of Palestinains threw stones at border police .
An officer and a Palestinain were lightly wounded in the disturbances .
In Hebron , Palestinian security forces loyal to President Abbas fired in the air to break up a crowd of hundreds of Hamas supporters , who were preparing to march to a nearby checkpoint .
Others threw stones at an Israeli citizen near hebron .
The Israeli was evacuated to hospital .
In the last two days , some 18 police officers have been injured trying to control the demonstrations .

trombik さんの日記から、インフラエンジニア討論会に行ってきたけど。
自然言語処理が使える分野でも、企業では手作業で仕事をしたりすることがまだまだ多い(常に機械化したほうがいいわけではないが、ほとんどの場合、全行程を機械化しないまでも、機械的な処理を補助的に使った方が圧倒的に効率がよい)のだが、なかなか「人手神話」を崩すのは難しい。
つい先日計量国語学を研究している人から聞いたのだが、彼女が
ChaSen で形態素解析して言語教育系の研究会で報告したところ、「形態素解析の精度はいくらだ」と言われ、次は言われたとおりに精度を書いたのに「そんな研究はうちでは評価できないから、違う分野で発表してほしい」と言われたそうだ。文系の人の気持ちとしては、人手でやったら精度は100%だから、機械で処理して精度が95%でもそんなものは信用できない、というココロなのだろう。
自然言語処理の門を叩いて4年目になる自分としては、そもそも何人かの人手でやっても精度は100%にならないし、ものによっては精度が70%程度にしかならなかったりする(問題自身が難しいこともあるし、不良設定問題で仕様がまともでないから人間でもつけられないこともある)ので、機械処理が100%でないからダメなどというのはおかしいよ、ということは分かるのだが……
とはいえ、自分も日本語話し言葉コーパスのアルバイトをしていたとき、全体の一部(具体的な割合は忘れたが、たとえば10%としよう)だけ人手で形態素解析のタグをつけて、機械学習で人手の形態素解析結果から自動解析器を学習して残りの90%にタグを付与して公開する、という話を聞いてまず思ったのは「なんで全部人手でつけないんだろうか」というものであり、次に思ったのは「人手以外は間違っているかもしれないんだから、公開するのは人手でつけた正解のところだけでいいのでは」ということだったので、人手でつけた結果しか信用しない人の気持ちも分かり、機械的な処理も有用であると言う人の気持ちも分かり、という感じ。
上記 trombik さんのブログからの引 用
自分の疑問 は 「効率化を進めたら、そのぶん人を切るだけなんじゃねーの?」というもの。「今まで5人でしていた仕事を1人でできるようになりました」「そうか、じゃ残りの4人の首を切ろう」とかね。だったら非効率的なやり方を続けた方がましで、効率化するモチベーションなんて上がるはずがない。もしくは効率化した分だけ別の仕事が増えて、効率化したら労働強化につながっただけとか。効率化を進めて人件費を削減しましたとか、効率化を進めて人件費は変わらずに処理できる仕事は増えましたとか、短期的には正しいのかもしれないけど、これじゃシステム管理しようとするひとがいなくなるのも当然で。
自然言語処理のような裏方技術も似たような状況で、「ここに自然言語処理のこの技術を使ったら業務にかかる時間が以前の50%になりました！」とか言っても、営業が「3000万円の案件取ってきました！」と言うのと比べると「フーン」という感じだろうし、あまりに「効率化」してしまうと首を切ろうという話になってしまったりするわけで……。(実際は人を遊ばせておくほどコスト意識が低いところはないだろうから、別の仕事を割り当てるのだろうが)
「 楽天はあの規模なのに手作業を続けている」の「楽天」のところに他の大企業名を入れても成り立つ話だと思うが、自然言語処理で効率化という筋で全部バラ色と思うのは小学生まで、ということかなー。
( 追記 ) 楽天で思い出したが楽天も情報爆発していますのコメント、しましまさんが長大な文章を書いてくださって、自分のささやかな文章よりはるかにためになるので、この分野に興味ある人はぜひ目を通してもらいたい。
I ’m always on the lookout for more fun ways of programming – I hate doing dull boilerplate work .
So I ’ve been trying out HAppS , a webserver framework for Haskell .
It ’s interestingly different from most web frameworks .
I want to capture my early observations before I forget them .
To give some context , my “ toy app ” I ’m building is an “ IMDB for Computer Scientists ” type website which gives structured information about people ( eg. Guy Steele ) , what papers they ’ve published ( eg. Growing a Language ) , what events they ’ve participated in ( eg. a talk about “ Growing a Language ” at OOPSLA , available via Google video ) .
So the biggest thing about HAppS it that it does n’t have to use a database to persist state .
It takes the Prevayler approach , which means all your data lives in RAM as normal in - memory data structures .
When the data is about to be modified , a delta is first persisted to a fast log on disk ( giving durability ) and then the in - memory version is updated .
Periodically , checkpoints are taken .
This is a huge win because it means you avoid the whole tedious ‘ impedance mismatch ’ involved with persisting to a database – O/R mappings , mismatches between DB types and language types .
It means that you can create new datatypes easily , and get on with the real business of adding functionality rather than futzing with databases .
Of course , there are downsides to this approach which I will discuss next .
But first , the big upside : I can develop features quicker .
Life being what it is , I ’m almost certainly making lots of mistakes whilst building my app .
Without a DB layer to burn time on , I can find out that I ’m ( inevitably ) building the Wrong Thing sooner and make a course correction .
Downside # 1 : you normally rely on a database to get fast indexed lookups .
With HAppS , you do this by constructing an in - memory hash table to act as an index .
Actually , that ’d be quite boring to do by hand so HApps uses metaprogramming ( template haskell ) to build the index data structures for you .
They are moderately smart , with lazy update strategies .
Downside # 2 : scalability and availability .
A big benefit of the usual “ stateless web frontend , stateful database ” split is that you can trivially scale the web fleet ( no state ) and fairly easily scale the database ( replication / partitioning ) .
With the HAppS approach it sounds like you can only have a single webserver / state - store machine – which means no horizontal scalability and bad availability .
Actually , that ’s not the whole story – the HAppS team are working on a system whereby the state gets shared across multiple machines ( permitting scalable reads ) and sharded ( each machine is the master for some subset of the state ) .
That should be a killer downside , right ?
The argument is looks like this : “ all successful webapps are popular , and popular apps must scale ” .
However , I think that to become a successful webapp , you have to firstly be a webapp .
My “ projects ” directory is littered with half - finished projects where I got bored before I finished it .
Quite frankly , if using HAppS means that I can avoid a lot of tedious work and actually finish a project then I ’ll happily embrace the ghost of future scaling pain .
Also , not every successful website gets as much traffic as Flickr / Twitter – my toy app is an “ IMDB for Computer Scientists ” and there just are n’t that many computer scientists in the world .
Not every website needs to be super - scalable from day one .
I ’m not being naive here – my dayjob is scalability central – but it ’s a question of finding the most appropriate hammer for the particular nail you ’re trying to hit .
Having said all that , let me qualify it a bit : I would ideally like to create a perfectly scalable webapp from day one if there was no overhead in doing so .
Most of the industry is focused on scalability - via - database , and attempt to minimize tedious work in various ways ( eg. metaprogramming and reflection in ActiveRecord ) .
However , these invariably ends up being painfully ‘ leaky ’ abstractions .
I ’ve seen this many times , and it ’s given me the motivation to look for other approaches which can avoid the persistence pain .
So perhaps HAppS is the answer , especially if my question is “ can I write a reasonable webapp quickly ” rather than “ can I write a superscalable website slowly ? ” .
Disadvantage # 3 : Data migrations .
This is really a red herring .
I do n’t really believe that data migrations are an advantage of having your data in a database .
If you are using an O / R mapping , you surely want to migrate old objects to new object , not old relations to new relations .
The approach which HAppS takes is to version your datatypes ( mostly done via metaprogramming ) and you write haskell code to migrate from old versions .
Disadvantage # 4 : Language dependence .
If you use a database , you can access your data from any language .
You can produce reports , do adhoc SQL queries and such like .
These are indeed useful ; I do this a lot .
However , language - independence comes at a cost ( impedance mismatch between database / language data types , business rules usually not applied at the database layer ) .
Often , language independent access can be better provided by service layers which wrap the database layer , providing insulation from the schema changes and allowing fine grained access control and throttling .
I ’ve never been able to query Flickr ’s database directly , but I ’ve accessed their data via their API many times .
HAppS provides more metaprogramming support for exposing data types via XML .
So that ’s why I ’m investing the time into learning about HAppS .
It ’s good to challenge your assumptions about how to do things .
In the next post , I ’ll write a bit about how HAppS works under the hood .
Several dozen conference - goers are filing into the Mendocino Room of the Embassy Suites Hotel in Burlingame , a San Francisco suburb , arming themselves with coffee and muffins as they shuffle to their seats .
It 's the kind of scene that occurs daily — if not hourly — in the Bay Area , where techies and businesspeople forever squeeze into drab meeting rooms to discuss how they are going to change the world .
But even by local standards , the attendees gathered here are chasing a dream so grand and exotic it makes the typical Internet confab look like an OSHA seminar .
Anyone can build a game - changing social - network platform or a virtual community or a set of open APIs .
But the people here want to start a nonmetaphorical revolution by creating their own independent nations .
In the middle of the ocean .
On prefab floating platforms .

At 9:12 am , Patri Friedman stands up to address the group .
A former Google software engineer , Friedman is 32 but comes off much younger , with close - cropped hair and a slightly nasal voice .
He is executive director of the Seasteading Institute , the nonprofit he founded in April 2008 , and this is the group 's first major event .
He surveys the room , taking in a cross section of Silicon Valley culture : A white - haired nanotech millionaire in a suit sits next to a grad student in a Transformers T - shirt .
If you were to break down the audience into high school classifications , you 'd find a couple of hippies and goths , a few hipsters , and several preppies .
The rest would definitely be at the nerd table .
The male - female ratio is 7 to 1 .
" This is n't enough to create a whole new civilization , " Friedman says .
" But this is a seed . "
The morning sessions from the first annual Seasteading conference , held in Burlingame California on October 10th .
Friedman and his followers are not the first band of wide - eyed dreamers to want to build floating utopias .
For decades , an assortment of romantics and whack jobs have fantasized about fleeing the oppressive strictures of modern government and creating a laissez - faire society on the high seas .
Over the decades , they 've tried everything from fortified sandbars to mammoth cruise ships .
Nearly all have been disasters .
But the would - be nation builders assembled here are not intimidated by that record of failure .
After all , their plans are inspired by the ethos of the modern tech industry , where grand quixotic visions are as common as BlackBerrys , and they see their task not as a holy mission but as something like a startup .
A couple of software engineers came up with an innovative concept , then outsourced it to a community and let the wisdom of the crowd improve on it .
They scored financing from a top - tier venture capitalist and assembled a board of directors .
They will be transparent , blogging their progress .
If they fail — which , let 's face it , is the most likely outcome — they will do so quickly , in time - honored Valley fashion .
But if they succeed , they have one hell of an exit strategy .
Friedman launches into what he calls " my standard rant " — a spiel about government 's shortcomings and why they 're so hard to repair .
In his eyes , government is a sclerotic monopoly that can count on high customer lock - in thanks to inertia and the lack of alternatives .
" Government is an inefficient industry because it has an insane barrier to entry , " he says .
" To compete with governments on existing land , you have to win a war , an election , or a revolution . "
He points to the democracy that emerged from the American Revolution as the last successful rollout and attributes the subsequent dry spell to the lack of uncolonized space on the map .
" We 've run out of frontier , " he says .
But there 's still one virgin realm left , and it covers 70 percent of the earth 's surface .
The purpose of the Seasteading Institute — and of this gathering — is to figure out how to make aquatic homesteads a reality .
But Friedman does n't just want to create huge floating platforms that people can live on .
He 's also hoping to create a platform in the sense that Linux is a platform : a base upon which people can build their own innovative forms of governance .
The ultimate goal is to create standards and blueprints that can be easily adapted , allowing small communities to rapidly incubate and test new models of self - rule with the same ease that a programmer in his garage can whip up a Facebook app .
" You could roll your own government out of pieces copied from all the societies around you , " Friedman says .
" Google set my standards for how fast something should grow .
This has potential to exceed those standards — if we make one seastead , there 's room for thousands . "
Your Home Away From … Everything !
You 're ready to move to the middle of the ocean .

Illustration : Kate Francis Friedman 's optimism is easier to buy into if you ignore the history of previous would - be nation builders .
There was Operation Atlantis , created by Ayn Rand admirer Werner Stiefel in the late 1960s .
Stiefel , who made a fortune selling dermatology products , devoted his life to creating a sovereign society with the freest markets imaginable .
He started with a ferro-cement boat that made a single successful voyage on the Hudson River .
He erected a system of seabreaks near the coast of Haiti but was run off by president Franè7ois Duvalier 's gunboats before he could put land on it .
He bought an oil rig and tried to anchor it between Cuba and Honduras , where it was destroyed by a storm .
Stiefel died in 2006 with little more than a sporadically published newsletter to show for his efforts .
In 1971 , real estate millionaire and committed libertarian Michael Oliver dumped large quantities of sand on two coral reefs in the South Pacific and dubbed it the Republic of Minerva , a land with " no taxation , welfare , subsidies , or any form of economic interventionism . "
Minerva was soon invaded by the nearby kingdom of Tonga , and it dissolved back into the ocean shortly thereafter .
The Oceania city project , a plan for a vast floating settlement off the coast of Panama , emerged in 1993 .
The founders took out a two - page ad in Reason , a libertarian magazine , promising to free prospective residents from governments " entangled in bureaucracy , corruption , and the free lunch philosophy . "
The project was disbanded the following year due to lack of interest and funds .
" The Libertarian party is small in number and too few members have the financial resources to bankroll their beliefs , " founder Eric Klien wrote on Oceania 's Web site .
Other projects still exist as hypothetical concepts .
There 's the Freedom Ship , a mile - long floating tax haven , which will come into being just as soon as its organizers can drum up the $ 10 billion needed to build it .
( They 've accused their former president of absconding with the first $ 400,000 they raised . )
The concept of failed aquatic libertarian havens has even entered the pop consciousness , providing the setting for the blockbuster videogame BioShock .
Wayne Gramlich will never move to the middle of the ocean — his wife forbids it .
But when the former software engineer , who has been " on sabbatical " since the late 1990s , stumbled across the Oceania Web site about a decade ago , he was both enthralled by the vision and dismayed at the execution .
An early Sun Microsystems employee who worked on browser security at the dawn of the World Wide Web , he thought what was needed was a dispassionate perspective — a realistic plan to build floating autonomous countries .
" Oceania had a lot of pretty pictures , pretty concept art , but that was it , " he says .
In 1998 he wrote a modest proposal , SeaSteading — Homesteading on the High Seas , to get beyond the grandiloquence .
" Big and expensive projects will have a very difficult time attracting the requisite capital , " Gramlich wrote .
An engineer at heart , he tried to devise a way to build islands on the cheap .
His report outlined how thousands of empty 2 - liter soda bottles could be used to create a floating platform .
That sounded like paradise to Friedman when he saw the paper on Gramlich 's site .
He had always been interested in big - picture socioeconomic theories .
The son of libertarian legal theorist David Friedman and grandson of the Nobel Prize - winning free - market economist Milton Friedman , Patri had until then expressed his worldview mainly through his lifestyle : engaging in " radical self - expression " at Burning Man , experimenting with drugs , living in intentional communities with several other families , and maintaining a polyamorous relationship with his wife .
His BMW 328i has a customized license plate : FRRREAK .
Friedman had read about money holes like Oceania and considered them too fantastical to bother with .
But the relative practicality of Gramlich 's ideas appealed to the software engineer in him .
Here was a simple kludge for a floating platform that might be affordable .
And if it could work , Friedman would love to be among the first settlers to live on the open sea .
" My dad and grandfather write about stuff , " he says .
" What interests me is doing something . "
He sent an email to Gramlich , and the two discovered that they lived a few miles apart in Sunnyvale , California .
In late 2001 , they began to collaborate on a new paper on seasteading .
They posted everything online , including their notes to each other .
( Friedman coded a Perl script that would allow anyone to submit comments on each paragraph . )
Over the next couple of years , Friedman and Gramlich assembled a 150 - page book on the logistics of seasteading .
Their guidelines were intensely pragmatic , explaining everything from how to fend off barnacles ( a " continuous discharge of low - level chlorination " ) to how to fend off foreign navies ( " sea - skimming anti-ship cruise missiles like the Chinese Silkworm are fairly cheap and quite effective " ) .
They described the least far - fetched , least expensive design for a safe seastead they could find — the floating spar .
The hypothetical dwelling looks like a giant dumbbell standing on end , with a large steel ballast underwater and a 48,000 - square - foot platform suspended above , where 120 people could live .
They estimated it could be built for about $ 3 million .
" That 's the same price as a nice house in San Francisco , " Friedman says .
( Their design has since evolved , as shown at above . )
Gramlich and Friedman 's online tome captured the imagination of like - minded geeks , who peppered it with suggestions and criticisms .
It was also brought to the attention of millionaire tech investor Peter Thiel , who shared Friedman and Gramlich 's dissatisfaction with land - bound governments .
Thiel was a cofounder of PayPal , and he viewed that company as a way to further his libertarian ideals — a way to move money around the world as 1s and 0s without the involvement of nations or their currencies .
After selling PayPal to eBay and walking away with a reported $ 55 million , Thiel started the hedge fund Clarium Capital , which made a fortune earlier this decade by correctly betting that oil prices would rise and the dollar would weaken .
Thiel has invested in Facebook , Friendster , LinkedIn , and Slide .
He has also donated $ 3.5 million to Aubrey de Grey 's Methuselah Foundation , which seeks to extend longevity , and given money to the campaigns of small - government conservatives like Ron Paul .
" Peter wants to end the inevitability of death and taxes , " Friedman says .
" I mean , talk about aiming high ! "
Last April ,
Thiel pledged a $ 500,000 investment and installed his right - hand man , Joe Lonsdale , as chair of the Seasteading Institute .
" Decades from now , those looking back at the start of the century will understand that seasteading was an obvious step toward encouraging the development of more efficient , practical public - sector models around the world , " Thiel said in a statement at the time .
Three months after the wire transfer went through , Friedman left his job at Google .
Friedman is quick to acknowledge that not everyone will share his vision .
" At first blush , this all sounds kind of crazy , and to see the potential beyond that — that 's pretty awesome , " he tells his fellow enthusiasts at the seasteading conference .
" There 's a lot of good craziness in this room ! "
The afternoon sessions from the first annual Seasteading conference , held in Burlingame California on October 10th .
But good craziness alone will not make seasteads work , and most of the day is spent discussing the nuts and bolts of creating a floating community .
First is the question of structure .
" The ocean is a harsh and corrosive environment , " Friedman says .
In addition to rust and barnacles , there 's wave motion , which is disorienting in the best of times and potentially fatal during a storm .
The Seasteading Institute hired Marine Innovation & Technology as a consultant to solve these problems .
Naval architect Alexia Aubault takes the lectern to describe the results of wave - motion analyses her engineering firm performed .
To protect the organization from frivolous infringement lawsuits , she is barred by the institute 's lawyer from showing off the refined design until a patent gets filed .
( That has since been done . )
And that 's just one of the legal torpedoes that seasteaders must dodge .
According to the UN's Law of the Sea , the jurisdiction of traditional nations extends up to 200 miles from shore , an exclusive economic zone within which countries can control fishing and mineral rights and police polluters .
Friedman hopes there will someday be self - sufficient seasteads that can thrive on the high seas , beyond the purview of any country .
But for the near future , he concedes , they 'll probably need to remain near shore and operate like cruise ships , which are bound by the laws of the country where they 're registered .
Most governments wo n't attack these kinds of vessels as long as they behave .
" At this point , it matters who you piss off , " he says .
( Raymond Peck , a former Reagan administration official , has agreed to do further research for the institute on the Law of the Sea . )
The first British baby genetically - selected to be free of a breast cancer gene has been born .
She grew from an embryo screened to ensure it did not contain the faulty BRCA 1 gene , which passes the risk of breast cancer down generations .
University College London said the the mother and her little girl were doing " very well " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Any daughter born with the gene has a 50 per cent to 85 per cent of developing breast cancer .
Announcing her birth , Paul Serhal , medical director of the Assisted Conception Unit at the hospital , said : " This little girl will not face the spectre of developing this genetic form of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in her adult life .
" The parents will have been spared the risk of inflicting this disease on their daughter .
" The lasting legacy is the eradication of the transmission of this form of cancer that has blighted these families for generations . "
In June the mother , then 27 , told how she decided to undergo the screening process after seeing all her husband 's female relatives suffer the disease .
The woman , who wanted to remain anonymous , said at the time : " We felt that , if there was a possibility of eliminating this for our children , then that was a route we had to go down . "
The technique , known as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) has already been used in the UK to free babies of inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington 's disease .
But breast cancer is different because it does not inevitably affect a child from birth and may or may not develop later in life .
There is also a chance it can be cured , if caught early enough .
Permission to carry out PGD for breast cancer had to be obtained from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority by the London clinic which performed the procedure .
The body , which licenses IVF clinics and embryo research , gave the go - ahead after holding a public consultation .
Doctors at the private clinic housed at University College Hospital conducted tests on 11 embryos by removing just one cell from each when they were three days old .
Six embryos were found to carry the defective BRCA1 gene .
Two embryos which were free of the gene were implanted , resulting in a single pregnancy .
Faulty genes are responsible for between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the 44,000 cases of breast cancer that occur in the UK each year .
BRCA1 and its sister gene BRCA2 are the two most commonly involved .
Women with a defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are up to seven times more likely to develop breast cancer than those without the mutations .

The coming collapse of the US $ Share This :
The collapse will come from two basic reasons or causes .
First ( the long - term reason ) : the fed is and has been " monetizing " America 's astronomical foreign debt ; it has also been monetizing internal political crises -- e.g. the several bailouts that are only the beginning of many , many more .
Monetizing = inflating the currency by printing dollars at a white - hot rate .
Each dollar printed infinitesimally reduces the value of every other dollar in circulation ; that is , it reduces the goods each dollar can purchase .
The feds and other levels of government receive great benefit from the wildcat printing of currency because the immediate impact is not inflationary ; that is , the first recipients of a new dollar are able to exchange it at the same rate as every other dollar .
The impact of inflation takes time to filter down through society to reach the point at which an average Joe finds that a loaf of bread costs twice what it did a year ago .
By the time bread has doubled or tripled or ??? , the increase in the money supply has been going on for years ; the politicians and other thieves have reaped the riches of being early recipients and the average Joe is stuck with dollars they 've diluted .
Second ( the more proximate reason / cause ) : foreign agents ( governments , banks , individuals , etc. ) who have purchased and held American dollars as a store of value and as a consequence of its status as the world 's reserve currency are just starting to dump the Greenback .
The good news : you probably have a few years before inflation hits like a truck .
You have time to get out of investments configured in American dollars ( tho ' all / most government - issued currencies are likely to be hit by the collapse ) ; you can still convert Greenbacks into reasonably priced durable goods like gold or the car you 'll need in a year or so .
It will be those who save American dollars and who invest " in America " who will suffer the most .

A headline from USA Today states " Investors dump $ 89B in U.S. securities in historic fire sale . "
They are dumping $ $$ for a range of reasons including an awareness that America 's suicidal inflation reduces the value of each dollar they hold , thus making dollars unattractive as a store of value .
In turn , the unattractiveness is pushing the Greenback out of its traditional role as the reserve currency of the world .
Dollar dumping -- just like dollar pumping -- takes time but the former will be a faster process in terms of its impact .
There will be a tipping point at which the collapse will come quickly .
The good news : you probably have a few years before inflation hits like a truck .

Whether or not you live in America , you will be impacted by the coming collapse of the American dollar , which I expect to occur within a few years ; if I were pressed to be more precise , I 'd guess in about one 1 /2 to 2 years .
When the collapse happens , it will be as swift and dramatic as that within the housing market and everyone in the media will mutter , " Wow !
I did n't see that one coming . "
It will be true .
The media is ' innocent ' -- read ' ignorant ' -- of economic principles and they seem to believe in political promises .
( I use the word seem in order to give benefit of the doubt ; perhaps they are merely toadies rather than incredible idiots . )
The collapse will come from two basic reasons or causes .
Four Democratic U.S.
House members are calling for the new attorney general and Homeland Security secretary to investigate allegations of racial profiling against Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio .
� Sheriff Arpaio has repeatedly demonstrated disregard for the rights of Hispanics in the Phoenix metropolitan area , � said a press release issued by U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr. , chairman of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee , and three other lawmakers .
� Under the guise of immigration enforcement , his staff has conducted raids in residential neighborhoods in a manner condemned by the community as racial profiling .
� Racial profiling and segregation are simply not acceptable , � Conyers , from Michigan , is quoted as saying in the release .
� Media stunts and braggadocio are no substitute for fair and effective law enforcement . �
Arpaio strongly denied that his deputies have used racial profiling .
� We 're doing the right thing , � the sheriff said .
� If I was worried , with all the allegations , why would I keep doing it ?
I 'm not stupid , having worked for the feds for 30 years �
Arpaio compared the lawmakers ' request to similar ones made within the past year from Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon and immigrant advocacy groups .
A federal investigation has n't materialized , which Arpaio said made him confident federal authorities would n't find any violations in his immigration - enforcement efforts .
He said he anticipated new �calls for investigation� after President Barack Obama was elected in November .
The other House members calling for the probe are Immigration Subcommittee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren , D - Calif. , Immigration Subcommitte Chairwoman ; Jerrold Nadler , D - N.Y. , Constitution Subcommittee Chairman , and Bobby Scott , D - Va. , Crime Subcommittee Chairman .
They and Conyers sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , former governor of Arizona , requesting the following :
That authorities investigate whether civil action should be taken against Arpaio 's office ; and that Arpaio be forced to conform to his agreement with federal authorities that allows deputies to enforce immigration laws .
� We urge that such an agreement be terminated if the situation cannot be remedied , � their letter states .
Arpaio has stirred controversy over the past few years by sending deputies into neighborhoods to conduct crime suppression operations that critics contend are really aimed at arresting illegal immigrants by targeting Latinos .
A series of recent worksite raids by the sheriff 's office have also drawn similar complaints of racial profiling and excessive use of force .
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have said Arpaio is following the agreement he signed with them allowing enforcement of federal immigration laws .

Visitors to Liberty Island and the Statue of Liberty will once again be able to climb the 354 steps from the base of the Statue of Liberty to the iconic crown that overlooks New York Harbor -- but not quite yet .
The Obama administration wants to reopen the crown , but certain safety measures have to be in place first .
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar went to the top of the crown with fellow Democrats New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez , New Jersey Rep. Albio Siries and New York Rep. Anthony Weiner .
He said a study is underway on whether to open the crown to the public and that the review should be complete in April .
Opening the crown " is very important to me , " said Salazar , but he added that any such plan must include the safety of the public .
Menendez suggested there may be some sort of lottery to allow limited numbers of tourists access to the crown on a daily basis .
After Sept. 11 , the government closed access to the crown along with the rest of the Statue and Liberty Island as a security measure .
When the island and base of the statue were reopened several years later , the crown remained closed off .
U.S. Park officials said the narrow spiral stairway first built for worker access was a danger for anyone suffering an injury or other medical event , such as a heart attack .
A 1999 internal study had also found that if there were a fire in the pedestal , the interior of the statue would act like a chimney with smoke suffocating anyone on the stairs .
However , several politicians , including Weiner , have pushed for reopening the crown to visitors , and have proposed a plan that would allow perhaps 10 at a time to make the climb .
There is still a concern that with as many as 20,000 visitors to the island on summer weekends such a system will create " bad feelings " by creating " haves and have nots , " a park official told NBCNewYork.com .

Steam Explosions , Earthquakes , and Volcanic Eruptions — What ’s in Yellowstone ’s Future ?
Yellowstone , one of the world ’s largest active volcanic systems , has produced several giant volcanic eruptions in the past few million years , as well as many smaller eruptions and steam explosions .
Although no eruptions of lava or volcanic ash have occurred for many thousands of years , future eruptions are likely .
In the next few hundred years , hazards will most probably be limited to ongoing geyser and hot - spring activity , occasional steam explosions , and moderate to large earthquakes .
To better understand Yellowstone ’s volcano and earthquake hazards and to help protect the public , the U.S. Geological Survey , the University of Utah , and Yellowstone National Park formed the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory , which continuously monitors activity in the region .
A 6 - page version optimized for print is available as a .pdf here ( fs2005-3024.pdf ; 1.9 MB )
Each year , millions of visitors come to admire the hot springs and geysers of Yellowstone , the Nation ’s first national park .
Few are aware that these wonders are fueled by heat from a large reservoir of partially molten rock ( magma ) , just a few miles beneath their feet .
As this magma - which drives one of the world ’s largest volcanic systems - rises , it pushes up the Earth ’s crust beneath the Yellowstone Plateau .
Midway Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park appears otherworldly beneath stormy skies .
In the background , steam vigorously rises from the hot waters of Grand Prismatic Spring , known for its rainbow colors produced by thermophilic ( “ heat loving ” ) organisms .
Grand Prismatic is the largest hot spring in Yellowstone and the third largest in the world .
This and other hydrothermal ( hot water ) features are among the main attractions for visitors to the park ( inset photo ) .
These features are fueled by heat from a large reservoir of partially molten rock ( magma ) , just a few miles beneath Yellowstone , that drives one of the world ’s largest volcanic systems .

Stresses in the crust produce movements on faults , causing earthquakes to occur .
Thousands of small quakes are recorded each year by the seismographic network of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory ( YVO ) , a partnership of the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) , the University of Utah , and Yellowstone National Park .
Faults and fractures also allow surface water to penetrate to depth and become heated , rising again to produce hydrothermal ( hot water ) features , such as geysers .
Steam and hot water carry huge quantities of thermal energy to the surface from the magma chamber below .
Continuing up - and - down ground motions on the Yellowstone Plateau reflect the migration of both hydrothermal fluids and magma below the surface .
Ground motions , earthquakes , and hydrothermal activity are all current manifestations of volcanic activity at Yellowstone .
In the not - so - distant geologic past , Yellowstone has produced many major volcanic eruptions , which have repeatedly reshaped its natural wonders .
Caldera - Forming Eruptions
The Yellowstone region has produced three exceedingly large volcanic eruptions in the past 2.1 million years .
In each of these cataclysmic events , enormous volumes of magma erupted at the surface and into the atmosphere as mixtures of red - hot pumice , volcanic ash ( small , jagged fragments of volcanic glass and rock ) , and gas that spread as pyroclastic ( “ fire - broken ” ) flows in all directions .
Rapid withdrawal of such large volumes of magma from the subsurface then caused the ground to collapse , swallowing overlying mountains and creating broad cauldron - shaped volcanic depressions called “ calderas . ”
The first of these caldera - forming eruptions 2.1 million years ago created a widespread volcanic deposit known as the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff , an outcrop of which can be viewed at Golden Gate , south of Mammoth Hot Springs .
This titanic event , one of the five largest individual volcanic eruptions known anywhere on the Earth , formed a caldera more than 60 miles ( 100 km ) across .
The region ’s most recent caldera - forming eruption 640,000 years ago created the 35 - mile - wide , 50 - mile - long ( 55 by 80 km ) Yellowstone Caldera .
Pyroclastic flows from this eruption left thick volcanic deposits known as the Lava Creek Tuff , which can be seen in the south - facing cliffs east of Madison , where they form the north wall of the caldera .
Huge volumes of volcanic ash were blasted high into the atmosphere , and deposits of this ash can still be found in places as distant from Yellowstone as Iowa , Louisiana , and California .
Each of Yellowstone ’s explosive caldera - forming eruptions occurred when large volumes of “ rhyolitic ” magma accumulated at shallow levels in the Earth ’s crust , as little as 3 miles ( 5 km ) below the surface .
This highly viscous ( thick and sticky ) magma , charged with dissolved gas , then moved upward , stressing the crust and generating earthquakes .
As the magma neared the surface and pressure decreased , the expanding gas caused violent explosions .
Eruptions of rhyolite have been responsible for forming many of the world ’s calderas , such as those at Katmai National Park , Alaska , which formed in an eruption in 1912 , and at Long Valley , California .
If another large caldera - forming eruption were to occur at Yellowstone , its effects would be worldwide .
Thick ash deposits would bury vast areas of the United States , and injection of huge volumes of volcanic gases into the atmosphere could drastically affect global climate .
Fortunately , the Yellowstone volcanic system shows no signs that it is headed toward such an eruption .
The probability of a large caldera - forming eruption within the next few thousand years is exceedingly low .
Lava Flows
More likely in Yellowstone than a large explosive caldera - forming eruption is eruption of a lava flow , which would be far less devastating .
Since Yellowstone ’s last caldera - forming eruption 640,000 years ago , about 30 eruptions of rhyolitic lava flows have nearly filled the Yellowstone Caldera .
Other flows of rhyolite and basalt ( a more fluid variety of lava ) also have been extruded outside the caldera .
Each day , visitors to the park drive and hike across the lavas that fill the caldera , most of which were erupted since 160,000 years ago , some as recently as about 70,000 years ago .
These extensive rhyolite lavas are very large and thick , and some cover as much as 130 square miles ( 340 km2 ) , twice the area of Washington , D.C. During eruption , these flows oozed slowly over the surface , moving at most a few hundred feet per day for several months to several years , destroying everything in their paths .
VOLCANIC HISTORY AND RECENT SEISMIC ACTIVITY IN THE YELLOWSTONE REGION
( Click the map for a larger version . )
Yellowstone is home to one of the world ’s largest active volcanic systems .
Cataclysmic eruptions in the past few million years created huge volcanic depressions called “ calderas . ”
The youngest , the Yellowstone Caldera , was formed 640,000 years ago .
Since then , about 80 eruptions of rhyolite ( thick , sticky lava ) and basalt ( more - fluid lava ) have occurred .
The caldera ’s interior is largely covered by rhyolites , most erupted in the past 160,000 years .
Large hydrothermal ( steam ) - explosion craters formed in the past 14,000 years are located near Yellowstone Lake and in major geyser basins .
Recent earthquakes ( 1973 to 2002 ) were concentrated between Hebgen Lake and the Norris Geyser Basin and along faults .
Today , most of the landforms within the Yellowstone Caldera reflect the shapes of these young lava flows .
Cliffs surrounding the Upper Geyser Basin near Old Faithful Geyser are the cooled steep flow fronts of once - slow - moving rhyolite lavas .
Some narrow ridges and valleys on the Canyon - Norris road are corrugations on the surface of a 110,000 - year - old rhyolite flow .
These roughly concentric ridges formed as the thick , pasty lava slowly oozed northeastward , wrinkling its surface .
Within the caldera , rivers and streams commonly occupy the gaps between individual lava flows , and springs emerge at the edges of flows .
Any renewed volcanic activity at Yellowstone would most likely take the form of such mainly nonexplosive lava eruptions .
An eruption of lava could cause widespread havoc in the park , including fires and the loss of roads and facilities , but more distant areas would probably remain largely unaffected .
Since its last cataclysmic volcanic eruption 640,000 years ago , the Yellowstone region has had about 40 eruptions of slow - moving lava flows of rhyolite ( a variety of molten rock that is thick and sticky ) .
Some of these flows cover more than 100 square miles , and many are very thick , like this approximately 180,000 - year - old rhyolite flow exposed at Obsidian Cliff .
Although no lava has been erupted at Yellowstone for 70,000 years , future such eruptions are likely to occur .

Earthquakes
From 1,000 to 3,000 earthquakes typically occur each year within Yellowstone National Park and its immediate surroundings .
Although most are too small to be felt , these quakes reflect the active nature of the Yellowstone region , one of the most seismically active areas in the United States .
Each year , several quakes of magnitude 3 to 4 are felt by people in the park .
Although some quakes are caused by rising magma and hot - ground - water movement , many emanate from regional faults related to crustal stretching and mountain building .
For example , major faults along the Teton , Madison , and Gallatin Ranges pass through the park and likely existed long before the beginning of volcanism there .
Movements along many of these faults are capable of producing significant earthquakes .
The most notable earthquake in Yellowstone ’s recent history occurred in 1959 .
Centered near Hebgen Lake , just west of the park , it had a magnitude of 7.5 .
This quake caused $ 11 million in damage ( equivalent to $ 70 million in 2005 dollars ) and killed 28 people , most of them in a landslide that was triggered by the quake .
Geologists conclude that large earthquakes like the Hebgen Lake event are unlikely within the Yellowstone Caldera itself , because subsurface temperatures there are high , weakening the bedrock and making it less able to rupture .
However , quakes within the caldera can be as large as magnitude 6.5 .
A quake of about this size that occurred in 1975 near Norris Geyser Basin was felt throughout the region .
Even distant earthquakes can affect Yellowstone .
In November 2002 , the magnitude 7.9 Denali Fault earthquake struck central Alaska , 1,900 miles ( 3,100 km ) northwest of Yellowstone .
Because this quake ’s energy was focused toward the active Yellowstone volcanic and hydrothermal system , it triggered hundreds of small earthquakes there .
The region ’s hydrothermal system is highly sensitive to quakes and undergoes significant changes in their wake .
Earthquakes may have the potential to cause Yellowstone ’s hot - water system to destabilize and produce explosive hydrothermal eruptions .
EARTHQUAKES IN THE YELLOWSTONE REGION
The Yellowstone National Park region produces about 2,000 earthquakes each year .
Most of these quakes are too small to be felt , but they reflect the active nature of the region , one of the most seismically active areas in the United States .
The most powerful earthquake in Yellowstone ’s recent history occurred in 1959 .
This quake was centered near Hebgen Lake , just west of the park , and had a magnitude ( M ) of 7.5 .
The Hebgen Lake earthquake killed 28 people - 26 in a huge landslide triggered by the quake - and caused $ 11 million in damage ( about $ 70 million in 2005 dollars ) .
Numerous structures and roads in the region were severely damaged when hillsides collapsed , gaping cracks opened in the ground , and large blocks of rock were displaced .
The Hebgen Lake quake caused widespread changes in Yellowstone - roads were closed throughout the area , some geysers stopped erupting , and others were newly formed or came back to life after years of dormancy .
Also , the Old Faithful Inn was strongly shaken - pipes broke , a chimney collapsed , and the inn had to be evacuated .
Although quakes of this magnitude are rare in the Yellowstone region , they are certain to occur in the future .
To better understand this hazard and help protect the public , scientists of the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory ( YVO ) continually monitor the region ’s seismic activity .
This house fell into Hebgen Lake during the 1959 earthquake and floated along the shore until it came to rest here .
The owner of the house , then - 70 - year - old Mrs. Grace Miller , escaped only after kicking out her front door and leaping a 5 - foot - wide ground crack as her house dropped into the lake .

Hydrothermal Explosions
The large magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone may have temperatures higher than 1,475 °F ( 800 °C ) , and the surrounding rocks are heated by it .
Because of this , the average heat flow from the Earth ’s interior at Yellowstone is about 30 times greater than that typical for areas elsewhere in the northern Rocky Mountains .
As snowmelt and rainfall seep deep into the ground , they can absorb enough of this heat to raise the temperature of the ground water close to the boiling point .
Geyser basins and other thermal areas in Yellowstone National Park are places where hot ground water has risen close to the surface .
Research drilling at Yellowstone in the 1960s confirmed that the ground water beneath many of the park ’s thermal areas is very hot .
At Norris Geyser Basin , water temperatures as high as 460 °F ( 238 °C ) were recorded at depths of only 1,090 feet ( 332 m ) .
Because the boiling point of water increases with increasing pressure and pressure increases with depth , deep water can be hotter than boiling water near the surface .
If the pressure that confines this deep water is reduced quickly , pockets of water may suddenly boil , causing an explosion as the water is converted to steam .
Such activity drives the eruptions of geysers , like Old Faithful , which are repetitive releases of plumes of steam and water .
Rarely , steam explosions are more violent and can hurl water and rock thousands of feet .
In Yellowstone ’s geologic past , such violent events , called “ hydrothermal explosions , ” have occurred countless times , creating new landscapes of hills and craters .
A recent and notable hydrothermal explosion occurred in 1989 at Porkchop Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin .
The remains of this explosion are still clearly visible today as an apron of rock debris 15 feet ( 5 m ) across surrounding Porkchop ’s central spring .
In the 1880s and early 1890s , a series of powerful hydrothermal explosions and geyser eruptions occurred at Excelsior Geyser in the Midway Geyser Basin .
Some of the explosions hurled large rocks as far as 50 feet ( 15 m ) .
Much larger hydrothermal explosions have occurred at Yellowstone in the recent geologic past .
More than a dozen large hydrothermal - explosion craters formed between about 14,000 and 3,000 years ago , triggered by sudden changes in pressure of the hydrothermal system .
Most of these craters are within the Yellowstone Caldera or along a north - south - trending zone between Norris and Mammoth Hot Springs .
The largest hydrothermal - explosion crater documented in the world is along the north edge of Yellowstone Lake in an embayment known as Mary Bay .
This 1.5 - mile ( 2.6 km ) - diameter crater formed about 13,800 years ago and may have had several separate explosions in a short time interval .
What specifically triggered these very large events is not firmly established , but earthquakes or a pressure release caused by melting glaciers or rapid changes in lake level may have been a significant factor .
These very large and violent hydrothermal explosions are independent of associated volcanism .
None of the large hydrothermal events of the past 16,000 years has been followed by an eruption of magma .
The deeper magma system appears to be unaffected even by spectacular steam explosions and crater excavations within the overlying hydrothermal system .
Although large hydrothermal explosions are a feature of Yellowstone ’s recent geologic history , most explosions in historical times have been relatively small and have left craters at most a few yards across .
For example , in early 2003 , a long linear fissure appeared on a hillside above Nymph Lake , north of Norris Geyser Basin , venting steam and throwing bits of rock onto the surrounding hillside .
Although most hydrothermal explosions in the park are small , their remains can be noticed by observant visitors and attest to the nearly continuous geologic activity at Yellowstone .
HYDROTHERMAL ( STEAM ) EXPLOSIONS AT YELLOWSTONE
Excelsior Geyser erupted in a series of violent hydrothermal explosions in the 1880s and early 1890s ; one of these eruptions is shown in this colorized postcard made from a photograph .
These were the largest such events to occur in the Yellowstone region in historical times .
( Original photograph by F. Jay Haynes , 1888 ; date on postcard is incorrect . )
Geysers and hot springs are common expressions of a hydrothermal ( hot water ) system , but sometimes changes in “ plumbing ” result in large volumes of water suddenly flashing into steam , causing violent hydrothermal explosions .
A large hydrothermal explosion can hurl water and rock thousands of feet and create new landscapes of hills and craters .
In Yellowstone ’s geologic past , hydrothermal explosions have occurred countless times .
In 1881 , Colonel Philetus W. Norris , Yellowstone National Park ’s second superintendent , witnessed a spectacular hydrothermal explosion at Excelsior Geyser in the Midway Geyser Basin .
He described the aftermath as follows : “ The pool was considerably enlarged , its immediate borders swept entirely clear of all movable rock , enough of which had been hurled or forced back to form a ridge from knee to breast high at a distance of from 20 to 50 feet [ 6 to 15 m ] from the ragged edge of the yawning chasm . ”
After a series of such explosions that ended in the early 1890s , Excelsior , once the world ’s largest active geyser , became a quietly boiling hot spring .
Except for several geyser eruptions in 1985 , it has remained so ever since .
A more recent hydrothermal explosion occurred in 1989 at Porkchop Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin .
The remains of this explosion are still clearly visible today as a 15 - foot ( 5 m ) - diameter apron of rock debris surrounding Porkchop ’s central spring .
Much larger hydrothermal explosions have occurred at Yellowstone in the recent geologic past .
The greatest concentration of hydrothermal - explosion craters lies around the north end of Yellowstone Lake .
These craters owe their origins to spectacular explosions thousands of years ago .
Colonel Philetus W. Norris was Yellowstone National Park ’s second superintendent ( 1877 to 1882 ) .
A decorated Civil War Union veteran , Norris enjoyed challenges , and his efforts were essential in putting the park ’s management on a sound footing .

PREHISTORIC CALDERA-FORMING
ERUPTIONS OF YELLOWSTONE
Eruptions of the Yellowstone volcanic system have included the two largest volcanic eruptions in North America in the past few million years ; the third largest was at Long Valley in California and produced the Bishop ash bed .
The biggest of the Yellowstone eruptions occurred 2.1 million years ago , depositing the Huckleberry Ridge ash bed .
These eruptions left behind huge volcanic depressions called “ calderas ” and spread volcanic ash over large parts of North America ( see map ) .
If another large caldera - forming eruption were to occur at Yellowstone , its effects would be worldwide .
Thick ash deposits would bury vast areas of the United States , and injection of huge volumes of volcanic gases into the atmosphere could drastically affect global climate .
Fortunately , the Yellowstone volcanic system shows no signs that it is headed toward such an eruption in the near future .
In fact , the probability of any such event occurring at Yellowstone within the next few thousand years is exceedingly low .
Volcanic ash , like this ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens , is made up of tiny jagged particles of rock and glass .
Even a light dusting of volcanic ash can pose a health hazard to people and animals and damage crops , electronics , and machinery .
Heavy ash fall , such as that from a large caldera - forming eruption , would devastate the surrounding area and affected areas downwind .
Ash particle magnified about 200 times .

How Big Were the Yellowstone Eruptions ?
Explosive eruptions are best compared by recalculating the volume of erupted volcanic ash and pumice ( see photos ) in terms of the original volume of molten rock ( magma ) released ( shown in this diagram by orange spheres ) .
On this basis , the 585 cubic miles ( mi3 ) of magma that was erupted from Yellowstone 2.1 million years ago ( Ma ) was nearly 6,000 times greater than the volume released in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens , Washington , which killed 57 people and caused damage exceeding $ 1 billion .
Even the 1815 Tambora , Indonesia , eruption — the largest on Earth in the past two centuries — was more than five times smaller than the smallest of Yellowstone ’s three great prehistoric eruptions at 1.3 Ma .
HAZARDOUS EVENTS AT YELLOWSTONE
Scientists evaluate natural - hazard levels by combining their knowledge of the frequency and the severity of hazardous events .
In the Yellowstone region , damaging hydrothermal explosions and earthquakes can occur several times a century .
Lava flows and small volcanic eruptions occur only rarely — none in the past 70,000 years .
Massive caldera - forming eruptions , though the most potentially devastating of Yellowstone ’s hazards , are extremely rare — only three have occurred in the past several million years .
U.S. Geological Survey , University of Utah , and National Park Service scientists with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory ( YVO ) see no evidence that another such cataclysmic eruption will occur at Yellowstone in the foreseeable future .
Recurrence intervals of these events are neither regular nor predictable .
How Dangerous Is Yellowstone ?
None of the events described above — cataclysmic caldera - forming eruptions , lava flows , large earthquakes , or major hydrothermal explosions — are common in Yellowstone .
Although visitors to Yellowstone National Park may never experience them , some hazardous events are certain to occur in the future .
Fortunately , systematic monitoring of Yellowstone ’s active volcanic and hydrothermal systems , including monitoring of earthquakes and ground deformation , is now carried out routinely by YVO scientists .
This monitoring will allow YVO to alert the public well in advance of any future volcanic eruptions .
Currently the ability to reliably predict large quakes or hydrothermal explosions , events more likely than a volcanic eruption , remains a challenge .
However , changes in the patterns of ongoing seismicity or other indicators of possible geologic unrest are quickly reported to officials responsible for public safety in the National Park Service and other agencies .
Through continuous monitoring and research , YVO is greatly improving understanding of Yellowstone ’s volcanic , earthquake , and hydrothermal hazards .
The work of USGS scientists with YVO is only part of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program ’s ongoing efforts to protect people ’s lives and property in all of the volcanic regions of the United States , including California , Hawaii , Alaska , and the Pacific Northwest .
THE YELLOWSTONE VOLCANO OBSERVATORY
This time last year was a very exciting time at linux.conf.au 2008 .
The conference organisers had arranged for 100 XO laptops to be given away to conference attendees .
The XOs came with the following message attached .
Please do something wonderful with this XO , or inspire someone else and pass it on .
I was fortunate enough to get one of these XOs .
I knew however that I would n’t have any time in the foreseeable future to actually do anything cool with my XO .
At the same time I did n’t simply want to give it away to someone , since I knew at some stage I would actually want to do something with it .
After chatting this over with a few other people I came up with the idea of putting together an OLPC Library .
( It was originally going to be OLPC Bank but after chatting it over with Pia we decided that a Library seemed to fit the ideals of the project much better ) .
So as part of the work I ’m doing with OLPC Friends we have finally launched OLPC Library .
At the moment this is just a place holder page but hopefully soon we will have a site up to actually enable people to loan out OLPCs whether that be to a developer wanting to write a new piece of software / port an application or a community advocate putting on a demo at a school or trade show .
If you are interested in helping out you can see the beginnings of the ideas for the website at the OLPC Library Project page and you can also join the mailing lists .

THE IRRELEVANCE OF ‘ FACTS ’….
The Washington Post had an item today on campaign mendacity , and noted that the McCain campaign , as long as the polls look good , has no reason to “ back down from statements he believes are fundamentally true , ” even when the claims are fundamentally false .
John Feehery , a Republican strategist , said the campaign is entering a stage in which skirmishes over the facts are less important than the dominant themes that are forming voters ’ opinions of the candidates .
“ The more the New York Times and The Washington Post go after Sarah Palin , the better off she is , because there ’s a bigger truth out there and the bigger truths are she ’s new , she ’s popular in Alaska and she is an insurgent , ” Feehery said .
“ As long as those are out there , these little facts do n’t really matter . ”
For now , there appears to be little political reason to back down .
A Washington Post - ABC
News poll taken Sept. 5 to Sept. 7 found that 51 percent of voters think Obama would raise their taxes , even though his plan would actually cut taxes for the overwhelming majority of Americans .
Obama has proposed eliminating income taxes on seniors making less than $ 50,000 a year , but 41 percent of those seniors say their income taxes would go up in an Obama administration .
It creates a process that encourages candidates to lie .
Voters believe the deception , and some media outlets will run a fact - check item on page A9 that few will notice or care about .
As the Republican said , “ Little facts do n’t really matter . ”
They ’re just pesky details , easily ignored for the purpose of conning voters .
Amazing .
I do , however , have a quick side note .
The Post / ABC poll showed that a majority of Americans ( 51 % ) believe Obama would raise their taxes .
Not only is that clearly false — the result of McCain ’s constant lying — it ’s largely backwards , since Obama ’s middle - class tax cuts are far bigger than McCain’s .
But that same Post / ABC poll showed Obama with a narrow national lead over McCain , 47 % to 46 % , among registered voters .
In other words , a lot of voters have been fooled on bogus tax claims , but they still plan to vote for Obama .
Hmm .
Have n’t we been here before ?
I. The Last Waltz ?
Repeating behaviors that have produced catastrophic failures and expecting a different result is insane ; and when a person ’s psychotic behavior puts himself and those around him in immediate physical danger , the responsibility of those who claim to be his friends is to restrain him .
But even as Waltz With Bashir shows in multiplexes across the world as a grim reminder of the precedent for Israel ’s brutal march of folly in Gaza , the U.S. ( and the editors of the New York Times and Washington Post ) insist that there is a sanity and rationality to sending one of the world ’s most powerful armies into a giant refugee camp to rend the flesh and crush the bones of those who stand in its way — whether in defiance or by being unlucky enough to have been born of the wrong tribe and be huddling in the wrong place .
By fighting its way to their citadel , they would have us believe , Israel can destroy Hamas and usher in a golden age of peace .
Or , to borrow from the casual callousness of Condi Rice during the last such display of futile brutality , we are witnessing , again , the “ birth pangs of a new Middle East . ”
Israel failed in 2006 , just as in 2002 and 1982 .
This time , they tell us , will be different .
And then the horror unfolds , as it always does — the hundreds of civilians accidentally massacred as they cowered in what they were told were places of safety , mocking Israel ’s torrent of self congratulation over its restraint and its brilliant intelligence — and the hopelessly out - gunned enemy manages to survive , as he does every time .
And by surviving , grows stronger politically .
No matter how many are killed , the leaders targeted by Israel ’s military are endlessly regenerated in the fertile soil of grievance and resentment born of the circumstances Israel has created .
Circumstances it has created , but which it , and its most fervent backers refuse to acknowledge , much less redress .
Arafat is dead and gone .
So are Sheikh Yassin , and Rantissi .
And Abbas al - Musawi , and Imad Mughniyeh .
Israel ’s ruthless efficiency at killing the leaders of Palestinian and Lebanese resistance groups is second to none , and yet , no matter who it kills , there are always thousands more , ready to declare , “ I am Spartacus ” .
That ’s because those who step up to lead these organizations are acting not out of personal ambition — leadership in Hamas is a death sentence .
The endless stream of Palestinians willing to sacrifice themselves in the role , then , is a symptom of the condition of their people .
And Israel ’s leaders know this .
Asked when running for Prime Minister a decade ago what he’d have done if he ’d been born Palestinian , Ehud Barak — the man directing the current operation in Gaza — answered bluntly , “ I ’d have joined a terror organization . ”
By the logic of his own instinct on the campaign trail in 1999 , Ehud Barak should know that Operation Cast Lead in Gaza cannot succeed , except , perhaps , in reviving his own political prospects .
No matter how many leaders , militants and ordinary civilians Israel kills in Gaza , Hamas — or something like it — will survive .
Waltz With Bashir — a movie that had to be made in Israel , I venture , because questioning Israeli militarism would have been deemed “ anti-Semitic ” in Hollywood — reminds us that , in 1982 , Ariel Sharon led an invasion of Lebanon supposedly aimed at stopping attacks on northern Israel , advancing all the way to Beirut in order to crush the PLO .
Sure , the PLO was driven out of Beirut and exiled to Tunisia , but the Israelis were forced within six years to begin negotiating with it because of the uprising of the youth of the West Bank and Gaza .
Lebanon in 1982 was a brutal and ultimately futile campaign that delivered only the brutal images of the massacres at Sabra and Shatila around which the movie centers .
Since 1982 , of course , Israel has laid siege to and bombed nearly every major Palestinian city , killing and imprisoning thousands of Palestinians , blundering into Lebanon again in 2006 and killing another thousand Lebanese , repeatedly bombed Gaza and choked off its economy for much of the past three years , and yet , nothing has changed :
They have killed some 700 in Gaza now , and still the rockets come ; regardless of the state of its structures , Hamas is politically stronger on the Palestinian street , while those Palestinian leaders who have cooperated with Israel and the U.S. are weaker and more discredited than ever .
The Israelis — and their backers in the American political establishment — appear incapable of grasping that which is empirically obvious : Hamas and its ilk grow stronger every time Israel seeks to eliminate them by force .
II .
Dangerous Illusions and a War of Choice
“ But what choice did Israel have ? ” say those in its amen corner in the U.S.
“ No normal society would tolerate rocket fire on its territory .
Hamas left it no option . ”
Well , actually , as Jimmy Carter explains from first - hand experience , Israel had plenty of alternatives and chose to ignore them , because it remains locked into the failed U.S. - backed policy of trying to overturn the democratic verdict of the 2006 Palestinian election that made Hamas the ruling party of the Palestinian Authority .
The primary Israeli- U.S. - European strategy here ( tacitly backed by Arab autocrats from Mubarak to Mahmoud Abbas ) has been to apply increasingly strict economic sanctions , in the hope that choking off the chances of a decent life for the 1.5 million people of Gaza would somehow force them to reverse their political choice .
Collective punishment , in other words .
So , even when Hamas observed a cease - fire between June and November , Israel refused to open the border crossings .
When the exchange of fire began again on November 5 when Israel raided what it said was a Hamas tunnel , Hamas escalated its rocket fire but made clear that it would restore and extend the cease - fire if Israel agreed to open the border crossings .
Israel ’s answer , Carter explains , was if Hamas ceased firing , Israel would allow 15 % of the normal traffic of goods into Gaza .
And it ’s any surprise that Hamas was not prepared to settle for just a 15 % loosening of the economic stranglehold ?
Hamas appeared to believe that creating a crisis would force Israel to agree to new terms .
Whether this was a mistaken belief or not actually remains to be seen :
If the truce that ends Israel ’s Operation Cast Lead leaves Hamas intact and includes the lifting of the siege , it will claim vindication .
Even now , Israeli leaders continue to insist , idiotically , that Hamas cannot be allowed to achieve any diplomatic gains as a result of any truce that must , of necessity , require its diplomatic cooperation .
Just as in 2006 , the Israelis have achieved the exact opposite political result to what they intended :
They have made it abundantly obvious , even to the incoming U.S. administration , that the policy of trying to isolate Hamas is spectacularly dysfunctional , and will have to be abandoned as a matter of urgency .
Even as the realization begins to dawn that their adversary , once again , will emerge politically stronger from a military pummeling , the Israelis contemplate one last bloody foray into the heart of Gaza City , hoping that military action can weaken Hamas and force it to surrender to Israel ’s terms .
Some American policymakers even cling to the fantasy that they can reimpose the regime of the pliant Mahmoud Abbas on Gaza — a pathetic fantasy , to be sure , because close observers of Palestinian politics know that the only thing keeping Abbas in charge of the West Bank , right now , is the presence of the Israeli Defense Force , and it ’s willingness to lock up his opponents .
Conveniently , for example , Abbas does n’t have to deal with his own legislature , which is dominated by Hamas , because Israel has locked up most of the legislators .
Mahmoud Abbas has allowed himself to be turned into a Palestinian Petain , and even much of the rank and file of his own Fatah party has turned against him .
Not even the Israelis believe he could control Gaza without them , and they are not inclined to stay .
If Hamas is not allowed to govern in Gaza , chances are that nobody will govern in Gaza .
It will look more like Mogadishu than like the West Bank — a chaotic cauldron run by rival warlords , with Hamas — no longer responsible for governance — the most powerful political - military presence ( although al - Qaeda will fancy its chances of setting up shop if the Hamas government is overthrown —
Hamas is the greatest bulwark against Bin Laden ’s crowd gaining a foothold in Gaza ) .
III .
Palestinian Sovereignty
The other trope being desperately worked by Israel ’s cheering section is the idea that this is simply another episode of a regional conflict between Israel and its mortal foe , Iran .
Hamas , we are told , by many media outlets that ought to know better , is a “ proxy of Iran ” .
This is simply not the case , and sober regional analysts know it : Hamas is certainly dependent on Iranian cash in Gaza , although those Western and Israeli strategic geniuses who deprived it of all other sources of funding ought not be surprised that Hamas turned for funds to those who would offer them .
No doubt it will take whatever military assistance it was offered , too .
But Hamas shares neither ideology nor the kind of political relationship with Iran that Hizballah does , in Lebanon .
Hamas was the creation of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood , originally , and its political decision making is entirely independent of Iran .
Syria is more politically influential over Hamas , of course , and Syria is hardly a proxy of Iran despite their alliance — if it was , why would the U.S. be working so hard on a diplomatic strategy to break that alliance ?
Moreover , the idea of Iran on some sort of path of confrontation with Israel is something of a phantom .
Sure , Ahmadinejad loves to warn that Israel will disappear , but he , and his superior , have long made clear that Iran has no intention of attacking Israel .
And you ’d think that those who insist that Iran ’s mullahs exist in order to destroy Israel , even at the cost of their own survival ( you know , the argument that the iranians are so ideologically committed to Israel ’s destruction that normal deterrence policies wo n’t restrain them ) might want to answer this question :
Why has Hizballah refrained from firing its massive arsenal of rockets at Israel as it butchers Palestinians in Gaza ?
Israel tells us they have the means , and there ’s no doubt they have the implacable rage .
Could the answer be that this Iranian proxy is being restrained by the pragmatic concern for its own survival and progress in Lebanon ?
And if so , what does this tell us about Iran ?
Then again , Iran is not especially relevant to the conflict in Gaza .
Nor was the crisis there created by the militancy of Hamas ; instead , it ’s the final bloody chapter in the failed Bush Administration - Israeli strategy to overthrow Hamas .
The alternative to war , ignored by Israel but patently obvious , is simple :
It will have to negotiate with Hamas .
( And spare me the “ but Hamas does n’t recognize Israel ’s right to exist ” argument :
No Palestinian leader would , if offered the chance to reverse history , allow Israel to have come into existence , for the simple reason that Israel ’s emergence was the Palestinian Nakbah , the catastrophe that dispossessed them and made them refugees .
Israel started talking to the PLO long before its charter was revised to allow for recognizing Israel ; its leaders realized that Israel could not be militarily defeated .
Many in Hamas have come to the same conclusion ; Efraim Halevy , the former head of Mossad , argues that Hamas is moving towards acceptance of a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders .
The Americans are simply going to have to let go of the idea that they ’re going to negotiate with a Palestinian leadership that answers to them , as Mahmoud Abbas does , rather than one that answers to the Palestinian public . )
As Oxford - based Israeli historian Avi Shlaim writes :
Israel likes to portray itself as an island of democracy in a sea of authoritarianism .
Yet Israel has never in its entire history done anything to promote democracy on the Arab side and has done a great deal to undermine it .
Israel has a long history of secret collaboration with reactionary Arab regimes to suppress Palestinian nationalism .
Despite all the handicaps , the Palestinian people succeeded in building the only genuine democracy in the Arab world with the possible exception of Lebanon .
In January 2006 , free and fair elections for the Legislative Council of the Palestinian Authority brought to power a Hamas - led government .
Israel , however , refused to recognise the democratically elected government , claiming that Hamas is purely and simply a terrorist organisation .
America and the EU shamelessly joined Israel in ostracising and demonising the Hamas government and in trying to bring it down by withholding tax revenues and foreign aid .
A surreal situation thus developed with a significant part of the international community imposing economic sanctions not against the occupier but against the occupied , not against the oppressor but against the oppressed .
As so often in the tragic history of Palestine , the victims were blamed for their own misfortunes .
Israel ’s propaganda machine persistently purveyed the notion that the Palestinians are terrorists , that they reject coexistence with the Jewish state , that their nationalism is little more than antisemitism , that Hamas is just a bunch of religious fanatics and that Islam is incompatible with democracy .
But the simple truth is that the Palestinian people are a normal people with normal aspirations .
They are no better but they are no worse than any other national group .
What they aspire to , above all , is a piece of land to call their own on which to live in freedom and dignity .
Like other radical movements , Hamas began to moderate its political programme following its rise to power .
From the ideological rejectionism of its charter , it began to move towards pragmatic accommodation of a two - state solution .
In March 2007 , Hamas and Fatah formed a national unity government that was ready to negotiate a long - term ceasefire with Israel .
Israel , however , refused to negotiate with a government that included Hamas .
It continued to play the old game of divide and rule between rival Palestinian factions .
In the late 1980s , Israel had supported the nascent Hamas in order to weaken Fatah , the secular nationalist movement led by Yasser Arafat .
Now Israel began to encourage the corrupt and pliant Fatah leaders to overthrow their religious political rivals and recapture power .
Aggressive American neoconservatives participated in the sinister plot to instigate a Palestinian civil war .
Their meddling was a major factor in the collapse of the national unity government and in driving Hamas to seize power in Gaza in June 2007 to pre-empt a Fatah coup .
The war unleashed by Israel on Gaza on 27 December was the culmination of a series of clashes and confrontations with the Hamas government .
In a broader sense , however , it is a war between Israel and the Palestinian people , because the people had elected the party to power .
The declared aim of the war is to weaken Hamas and to intensify the pressure until its leaders agree to a new ceasefire on Israel ’s terms .
The undeclared aim is to ensure that the Palestinians in Gaza are seen by the world simply as a humanitarian problem and thus to derail their struggle for independence and statehood .
Shlaim introduces us to the deeper flaw in the “ no normal society would tolerate rocket fire ” reasoning : Israel , quite simply , is not a normal society .
It is a country without fixed legal borders , and the disputes over where those borders should be drawn — the basic conflict not over religion or ideology , but over land and power — is at the very epicenter of the current clash in Gaza , and of Israel ’s never - ending series of wars with those around it .
One can only hope , with great fervor , that Barak Obama has heeded the wisdom of his foreign policy tutor Brent Scowcroft , whose observations about the folly of the Bush Administration backing Israel ’s 2006 campaign against Hizballah apply as much to today ’s offensive in Gaza : “ Hezbollah is not the source of the problem , ” Scowcroft wrote in the Washington Post .
“ It is a derivative of the cause , which is the tragic conflict over Palestine that began in 1948 .
The eastern shore of the Mediterranean is in turmoil from end to end , a repetition of continuing conflicts in one part or another since the abortive attempts of the United Nations to create separate Israeli and Palestinian states in 1948 . ”
If that were true in Lebanon , it ’s even more so in Gaza .
To understand everything from why Hamas refuses to recognize the State of Israel ; why it fights by means both fair and terribly foul ; and why it won Gaza by a landslide in the 2006 election ; a good starting point is the demographic composition of the strip — 80 % of today ’s Gazans are refugee families , who were driven out of homes and off land they owned inside what is now Israel in 1948 , and forbidden by one of the founding laws of the State of Israel from ever returning .
Is it any surprise then that the basic default position of Palestinian politics has always been to refrain from “ recognizing ” Israel in the sense of simply abandoning their own claims to homes and land stolen from them by Israel ’s very creation .
Sure , Israel can say it won the war of 1948 , and to the victor the spoils .
But what would Ehud Barak do if it had been his father or grandfather who ’d been forced off a farm in Ashkelon and now found himself in the hellhole of Gaza ?
You already know his answer .
And that answer will remain the same ( even if Barak would never dream of admitting it any longer ) as long as justice and dignity is denied to the community that gave rise to Hamas .
What Operation Cast Lead has revealed in stark and brutal terms , is that Israel ’s leadership is incapable of transcending the dysfunctional patterns that lock it into a morbid cycle that precludes Middle East stability .
Israel is moving steadily to the right politically — even when the center - left was in power and negotiating with the Palestinians , settlements on occupied land expanded at a steady clip ; no Israeli government for the foreseeable future is going to withdraw from the West Bank to the Green Line .
So , if the madness is to be stopped , Israel and the Palestinians will have to be told where their borders are , as part of an internationally enforced , fair settlement that gives the parties no choice , and provides the Turkish troops to enforce it .
But hey , I ’m not holding my breath …
Recent animal studies have shown that clioquinol — an 80 - year old drug once used to treat diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disorders — can reverse the progression of Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s and Huntington ’s diseases .
Scientists , however , had a variety of theories to attempt to explain how a single compound could have such similar effects on three unrelated neurodegenerative disorders .
Researchers at McGill University have discovered a dramatic possible new answer : According to Dr. Siegfried Hekimi and colleagues at McGill ’s Department of Biology , clioquinol acts directly on a protein called CLK - 1 , often informally called “ clock - 1 , ” and might slow down the aging process .
The advance online edition of their study was published in Oct. 2008 in the Journal of Biological Chemistry .
“ Clioquinol is a very powerful inhibitor of clock - 1 , ” explained Hekimi , McGill ’s Strathcona Chair of Zoology and Robert Archibald & Catherine Louise Campbell Chair in Developmental Biology .
“ Because clock - 1 affects longevity in invertebrates and mice , and because we ’re talking about three age - dependent neurodegenerative diseases , we hypothesize that clioquinol affects them by slowing down the rate of aging . ”
Once commonly prescribed in Europe and Asia for gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea and shigella , clioquinol was withdrawn from the market after being blamed for a devastating outbreak of subacute myelo-optic neuropathy ( SMON ) in Japan in the 1960s .
However , because no rigorous scientific study was conducted at the time , and because clioquinol was used safely by millions before and after the Japanese outbreak , some researchers think its connection to SMON has yet to be proven .
The exact mechanism of how clioquinol inhibits CLK - 1 is still under investigation , Hekimi said .
“ One possibility is that metals are involved as clioquinol is a metal chelator , ” he explained .
Chelation is a type of binding to metal ions and is often used to treat heavy metal poisoning .
Hekimi is optimistic but cautious when asked whether clioquinol could eventually become an anti-aging treatment .
“ The drug affects a gene which when inhibited can slow down aging , ” he said .
“ The implication is that we can change the rate of aging .
This might be why clioquinol is able to work on this diversity of diseases that are all age - dependent . ”
However , he admits to being concerned about how people may interpret his results .
“ The danger is that you can buy a kilogram of this compound at a chemical wholesaler , but we do n’t want people to start experimenting on themselves .
Clioquinol can be a very toxic substance if abused , and far more research is required . ”

WASHINGTON  As Iraq moved to force Blackwater Worldwide out of the country , the State Department asked two other American companies how quickly they could take over the company ’s contract to provide personal security for American diplomats in Baghdad , several American officials said Thursday .
Iraqi government officials announced this week that they had refused to give a license to operate to Blackwater , whose guards were involved in shootings that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead in Baghdad in September 2007 .
The State Department responded Thursday by saying that it would comply with Iraq ’s order , though a spokesman said no decision had yet been made on how the department would replace Blackwater .
But last month , State Department officials met with representatives from Blackwater and two other security contractors , Dyncorp International and Triple Canopy , said participants in the meeting , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the subject .

Toronto : Wednesday January 8 , 2009 Time : 10:25 amA diverse group of Jewish Canadian women are currently occupying the Israeli consulate at 180 Bloor Street West in Toronto .
This action is in protest against the on - going Israeli assault on the people of Gaza .
The group is carrying out this occupation in solidarity with the 1.5 million people of Gaza and to ensure that Jewish voices against the massacre in Gaza are being heard .
They are demanding that Israel end its military assault and lift the 18 - month siege on the Gaza Strip to allow humanitarian aid into the territory .
Israel has been carrying out a full - scale military assault on the Gaza Strip since December 27 , 2008 .
At least 660 people have been killed and 3000 injured in the air strikes and in the ground invasion that began on January 3 , 2009 .
Israel has ignored international calls for a ceasefire and is refusing to allow food , adequate medical supplies and other necessities of life into the Gaza Strip .
Protesters are outraged at Israel′s latest assault on the Palestinian people and by the Canadian government′s refusal to condemn these massacres .
They are deeply concerned that Canadians are hearing the views of pro-Israel groups who are being represented as the only voice of Jewish Canadians .
The protesters have occupied the consulate to send a clear statement that many Jewish - Canadians do not support Israel′s violence and apartheid policies .
They are joining with people of conscience all across the world who are demanding an end to Israeli aggression and justice for the Palestinian people .
The group includes : Judy Rebick , professor ; Judith Deutsch , psychoanalyst and president of Science for Peace ; B.H. Yael , filmmaker ; Smadar Carmon , an Canadian Israeli peace activist and others .
Spokespersons for the group will be outside the Israeli consulate .

As of Thursday morning , the Israelis have now killed 1038 and wounded 4850 Palestinians .
The BBC reports that “ More than 300 of the dead are said to be children , 76 are women and more than 4,500 people have been injured , of whom 1,600 are children and 678 are women . ”
In addition , many of the dead or wounded are just Gaza police and municipal authorities that the Israelis are counting as “ Hamas ” when they may be no such thing .
Tens of thousands of civilians have been rendered homeless , which is to say that there are thousands of families and children without shelter in the middle of winter ( the low tonight in Gaza is 6 C./ 42 F. )
Aljazeera English reports on babies who died because of the interruption in transportation and hospital care .

The head of the Red Cross remarked on Wednesday that the situation is “ shocking . ”
‘ “ I saw this dramatic humanitarian situation .
There ’s an increasing number of women and children being wounded and going to hospitals , ” Jakob Kellenberger told reporters in Jerusalem .
“ It is shocking .
It hurts when you see these wounded people and the types of wounds they have .
And I think that in addition the number of people coming to these hospitals is increasing , ” he said .
The Red Cross president called for improved access for ambulances inside Gaza seeking to recover the wounded and to rescue civilians sheltering from the fighting , saying Israel ’s daily three - hour pause in operations is “ not sufficient . ”
“ It is a positive step that you have a three - hour stop in the fighting , for doing humanitarian work , but it is not sufficient , ” he said .
“ Civilians who are being wounded , who are being trapped with problems of hunger , without water , you must be able to say that you can reach them . ” ‘
It is now estimated that Israel has inflicted $ 1.4 bn. in damages on Gaza , which was already desperately poor .
It is being accused of deliberately and wantonly targeting civilian targets , on the grounds that they are ‘ symbols of government ’ and Hamas had gotten into control of the government .
The respected medical journal Lancet let the Israeli leadership have it in an editorial this week :
‘ “ We find it hard to believe that an otherwise internationally respected , democratic nation can sanction such large and indiscriminate human atrocities in a territory already under land and sea blockade , ” The Lancet said .
“ The collective punishment of Gazans is placing horrific and immediate burdens of injury and trauma on innocent civilians .
These actions contravene the fourth Geneva convention . ”
The editorial also blasted “ national medical associations and professional bodies worldwide , ” accusing them of keeping silent as the destruction unfolded .
“ Their leaders , through their inaction , are complicit in a preventable tragedy that may have long - lasting public - health consequences not only for Gaza for also for the entire region , ” it said . ’
The Lancet editorial board used the same word as I have , “ atrocities , ” for what is being done to the civilian population , and agrees with my charge of indiscriminate fire on civilians ( a war crime ) and contravention of the international law governing treatment of subject populations in occupied territories ( Israel controls Gaza ’s borders , air and sea access and denies it statehood , and so is the occupying authority .
Having merely removed its colonists does not mean it is no longer an occupier ; colonizing an occupied territory is itself illegal ) .
The Israeli military ’s apparent targeting of clinics and other medical facilities at a time when they are most needed for care of civilians seems to have especially angered the Lancet editors .
Palestinian human rights organizations are calling on the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention to convene to investigate Israeli abuses of the law .
Unlike the obsequious US press , Britain ’s Channel 4 is capable of challenging the propaganda that Hamas was intensively bombarding Israel with rockets during the 2008 ceasefire .
The anchor was given a report by the Israeli government that showed that Hamas did not in fact send rockets on Israel in that period .
Only 20 rockets were fired from Gaza between June and December of 2008 , and they were fired by organizations other than Hamas .
No Israelis were killed in that period by these little home made projectiles .
Trita Parsi takes on the glib charges about Iran and Gaza , and warns that the Gaza War is a trap for Obama in his proposed opening to Iran .
The European Union has put off plans to declare Israel a privileged partner in trade , diplomacy and political ties on Wednesday .
The falling through of this program is a blow to Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni , who had hoped to campaign on the achievement in her bid for the prime ministership ( the election is Feb. 10 ) .
The plan was derailed by commissioner for external relations Benita Ferrero - Waldner , who has been involved in trying to broker peace in Sri Lanka and in freeing imprisoned Bulgarian nurses in Libya .
She has been an activist in helping children AIDS victimes .
She is a former Austrian foreign minister .
There is no talk of sanctions against Israel ; what has happened is only that extra privileges are not being proffered .
The EU officials are clearly very disturbed by the bloodbath in Gaza .
Ramiro Cibrian - Uzal , the EU ambassador to Israel , put the matter as delicately as he could : “ In a war situation , in a situation in which Israel is at war , using its war means in a very dramatic way , in a powerful way in Gaza , everybody realises that it is not the appropriate time to upgrade bilateral relations . ”
“ Using its war means in a very dramatic way ” seems pretty clearly an implicit condemnation of the disproportionate use of force and the complete disregard for civilian life that has characterized Israel ’s massive bombardment of densely populated Gaza .
The thing I cannot understand is why it is only the war that should give Europe pause ?
What about the blockade on Gaza , which left 15 percent of Gazan children ( and half of them are children ) malnourished ?
In fact , I would argue that until the 1.5 million people of Gaza are freed from Israeli control and abuse , there is no reason for the EU to reward Israel with special perquisites not given other non-European countries .
I would argue that Israel is keeping the Gazans in a state akin to slavery .
Here are some similarities between the condition of the people of Gaza and classical slavery :
They were deprived of their basic rights as a result of a military conquest .
( Peoples and individuals have often been enslaved as a result of being vanquished . )
They are stateless .
In fact , US slaves at the time the constitution was written in the eighteenth century were at least counted as 3/5s of a citizen .
Gazans are not counted as citizens at all by any existing state .
They have suffered what Orlando Patterson called “ social death . ”
Most Gazans are refugees from the 1948 and 1967 wars and used to live in what is now Israel , but had their property stolen by the European Jewish settlers .
They are now trapped in Gaza , and are cut off from many other members of their clan .
Social death occurs when the enslaved is removed from his or her original social and geographical context .
The Gazans are certainly for the most part cut off in this way .
Gazans lack mobility , being trapped in the Gaza Strip .
Israel controls their borders and their air and coastline .
There is also a checkpoint on the short border with Egypt , but it is strictly policed .
It is typical of the condition of slaves that they are deprived fo the liberty of movement .
They do not control their own property .
Thus , Gazans cannot own a medical clinic , e.g. , and be sure of it not being bombed by the Israelis .
They can never know from day to day what the Israelis will do to their property .
They cannot export their goods via their harbor on the Mediterranean because Israel does not allow it .
They cannot have a functioning airport .
Likewise slaves do not actually own property , since the slavemaster actually owns it and can dispose of it as he likes .
Innocent Gazans may be killed or maimed with impunity by Israeli bombs and shells .
Likewise , slavemasters in most societies can kill or beat their slaves with few repercussions .
The mass killing at the Gaza school Tuesday and the civilian deaths at the Zaiton neighborhood are a terrible disaster , period .
Not a public relations disaster , as opposed to the dominant tone that took over public discourse yesterday .
It was also not a diplomatic disaster , the kind that would boost international pressure exerted on Israel to end its Gaza operation , even if this will very likely happen .
The bombing of the school will be the equivalent of the Kfar Qana bombing in the Lebanon war .
It is a dramatic event any way you look at it .
UNRA is an agency designated by the United Nations to take care of Palestinian refugees ; it is not a terror group .
Those who stayed at the school Tuesday took cover there from the bombings and raging battles .
By doing so , they fully followed the instructions of the IDF , which for a week now has been urging citizens – via leaflets , text messages , and public announcements – to evacuate their homes located in trouble - prone areas .
Meanwhile , the bottom floor of the building in the Zaiton neighborhood was occupied by frightened families who left the top floors for fear of Air Force attacks .
The killing of the people at the school and in Zaiton is intolerable .
Gaza civilians not the enemy
We cannot just shrug it off and say that this was an “ operational mishap , ” or automatically resort to a plethora of self - righteous explanations .
The talkback scene in Israel is apparently a lost cause when it comes to exaggerated passion and indifference .
Yet the minimum that we could ask of the official , sane Israel was an expression of deep regret over the death of innocents .
Instead , we received a statement by the IDF spokesman claiming that this was a case of “ firing in response to an attack , ” as “ the school was apparently used as a launching site for mortar shells at IDF troops . ”
Woe on us if the level of certainty required for razing a school is “ apparently . ”
Tuesday afternoon , I stood on top of a small hill in the south .
Civilians and media personnel gathered there too , watching the ongoing aerial and artillery assault whose difficult results were only discovered later as if they were hypnotized .
A thick cloud of smoke rose from the Strip and then slowly sailed towards Israeli territory .
It was a black cloud .
Israel justifiably embarked on the retaliation and deterrence operation in Gaza .
Yet the principles of justice , morality , and proportionality now require it to quickly aspire to end the fighting .
The civilian population in the Gaza Strip is not the enemy , and the terrible suffering caused to it does not serve any Israeli interest .

MPs are being asked to support a move to have Charles Darwin 's birthday made a public holiday in Britain .
The campaign is timed to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the biologist 's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin the Species , the seminal text which explained evolutionary theory for the first time .
Andrew Copson , director of education and public affairs at the British Humanist Association ( BHA ) said : " Charles Darwin is one of the greatest and most influential thinkers who ever lived and one of Britain 's greatest scientists .
" In the middle of February we could all do with an extra public holiday and recognition of this particular day would be a great way of celebrating Britain 's great contribution to science , reason and free thought . "
Darwin's birthday was on February 12th .
The campaign is being supported by Ashok Kumar , the Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland , who has tabled an early day motion in the Commons .
The motion already has the support of ten MPs .
It reads : " That this House notes the extraordinary achievements of Charles Darwin ; notes that 2009 marks both the 200th anniversary of Darwin 's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species ; welcomes proposals for the creation of a Darwin Day in recognition of the ground - breaking work of the British scientist responsible for the theory of evolution by natural selection ; and calls for Darwin 's birthday , 12 February , to be designated a public holiday in honour of one of the fathers of modern science and one of Britain 's greatest , if not the greatest , scientific minds . "
The current campaign follows a similar effort in 2003 when over 40 highly - regarded academics , philosophers , scientists and writers called for a new public holiday , including philosopher Simon Blackburn , biologist Richard Dawkins , co-discoverer of DNA Francis Crick , author Philip Pullman and writer Claire Rayner .
The Darwin Day initiative follows several high - profile campaigns by atheist and secularist groups , including the now - infamous atheist buses currently operating around the country which feature the slogan : " There is probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
Summary of Findings
The internet , which emerged this year as a leading source for campaign news , has now surpassed all other media except television as an outlet for national and international news .
Currently , 40 % say they get most of their news about national and international issues from the internet , up from just 24 % in September 2007 .
For the first time in a Pew survey , more people say they rely mostly on the internet for news than cite newspapers ( 35 % ) .
Television continues to be cited most frequently as a main source for national and international news , at 70 % .
For young people , however , the internet now rivals television as a main source of national and international news .
Nearly six - in - ten Americans younger than 30 ( 59 % ) say they get most of their national and international news online ; an identical percentage cites television .
In September 2007 , twice as many young people said they relied mostly on television for news than mentioned the internet ( 68 % vs. 34 % ) .
The percentage of people younger than 30 citing television as a main news source has declined from 68 % in September 2007 to 59 % currently .
This mirrors a trend seen earlier this year in campaign news consumption .
( See “ Internet Now Major Source of Campaign News , ” News Interest Index , Oct. 31 , 2008 . )
The survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted Dec. 3 - 7 among 1,489 adults , finds there has been little change in the individual TV news outlets that people rely on for national and international news .
Nearly a quarter of the public ( 23 % ) says they get most of their news from CNN , while 17 % cite Fox News ; smaller shares mention other cable and broadcast outlets .
Top News Stories of 2008
While the 2008 presidential campaign attracted high levels of public attention , the economy was the top story of the year in terms of news interest , according to Pew ’s Weekly News Interest Index .
In late September , as the nation ’s financial crisis deepened , 70 % said they were following news about the economy very closely .
That ranks among the highest levels of news interest for any story in the past two decades .
News about gas prices , both rising and falling , also attracted considerable public attention .
In early June , two - thirds of Americans ( 66 % ) said they were tracking news about the rising price of gasoline very closely .
The rising price of gasoline was the top news story in 2007 , but far fewer followed news about rising gas prices very closely ( 52 % in May ) .
This year , the falling price of gas also drew broad interest ( 53 % very closely in October ) .
The congressional debate over legislation to stabilize financial markets also drew extensive interest .
In early October , just after President Bush signed the financial rescue measure , 62 % followed this story very closely .
Interest in election news remained at historically high levels throughout the lengthy campaign .
Interest in the general election peaked in mid-October ( at 61 % ) , but approached that level at other points in the campaign .
Public interest in the primary campaigns also was higher than during previous primary contests .
In mid-February , 44 % said they were following news about the candidates for the presidential election very closely .
Notably , the war in Iraq was not among this year ’s 15 most closely followed news stories .
In mid-July , a third of Americans ( 33 % ) said they were following news about the current situation and events in Iraq , the highest percentage measured this year .
In 2007 , interest in news about the war reached 40 % in early January , just before President Bush announced his troop surge ; the war in Iraq was the sixth - ranked story last year .
In Pew ’s final Weekly News Interest Index for 2008 , nearly four - in - ten Americans ( 37 % ) say they followed news about the Bush administration ’s plan to provide emergency loans to U.S. automakers .
That is in line with previous measures of public interest in the debate over whether to aid the struggling automakers .
Three - in - ten ( 30 % ) paid very close attention to news about a Wall Street investor , Bernard Madoff , who allegedly cheated people out of billions of dollars .
Nearly as many ( 28 % ) tracked news about an Iraqi journalist throwing his shoes at President Bush very closely , and 25 % said they followed news about slumping retail sales during the holiday season very closely .
These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index , an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press .
The index , building on the Center ’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories , examines news interest as it relates to the news media ’s coverage .
The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , which monitors the news reported by major newspaper , television , radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis .
The most recent survey was conducted December 19 - 22 from a nationally representative sample of 1,013 adults .
About the News Interest Index
The News Interest Index is a weekly survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press aimed at gauging the public ’s interest in and reaction to major news events .
This project has been undertaken in conjunction with the Project for Excellence in Journalism ’s News Coverage Index , an ongoing content analysis of the news .
The News Coverage Index catalogues the news from top news organizations across five major sectors of the media : newspapers , network television , cable television , radio and the internet .
Each week ( from Sunday through Friday ) PEJ compiles this data to identify the top stories for the week .
The News Interest Index survey collects data from Friday through Monday to gauge public interest in the most covered stories of the week .
Results for the weekly surveys are based on telephone interviews among a nationwide sample of approximately 1,000 adults , 18 years of age or older , conducted under the direction of ORC ( Opinion Research Corporation ) .
For results based on the total sample , one can say with 95 % confidence that the error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls , and that results based on subgroups will have larger margins of error .

A California state assemblyman from San Francisco has introduced legislation that would legalise and tax marijuana , a move he hopes will help shore up the state 's dire finances .
The bill by San Francisco representative Tom Ammiano , would legalise the cultivation , possession and sale of marijuana by people 21 and older .
It would charge growers and wholesalers a $ 5,000 ( £ 3,400 ) initial franchise fee and a $ 2,500 annual renewal fee , and would levy a $ 50 per ounce fee on retailers .
The law , which would make California the first state to legalise marijuana , would inject an estimated $ 13 bn a year in revenue into California 's empty coffers .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on Friday signed a $ 130bn budget that raises sales and income taxes , and dramatically slashes spending .
States across the country are facing massive revenue shortfalls , as income and real estate tax receipts fall and outlays for unemployment insurance and health coverage rise .
" It is simply nonsensical that California 's largest agricultural industry is completely unregulated and untaxed , " Marijuana Policy Project California policy director Aaron Smith said at a news conference announcing the bill .
" With our state in an ongoing fiscal crisis — and no one believes the new budget is the end of California 's financial woes — it 's time to bring this major piece of our economy into the light of day . "
California Republicans seem to oppose the bill .
" I think substance abuse is just ruining our society , " Assemblyman Paul Cook told a California newspaper , as if it were slothful dope - heads and not , say , gluttonous financial services executives that had wrecked our economy .
" I ca n't support that . "
The bill is the first of its kind in California , according to Marijuana Policy Project communications director Bruce Mirken , who cites research showing that marijuana is America 's largest cash crop .
I can't predict if this bill will pass , or even get out of committee .
( Note that in Pumping Iron , the champion bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger famously tokes on what appears to be a joint , while reclining on a weight bench ) .
But it is certainly one of many legalisation efforts to come .
In his fantastic book on generational marketing , The Age Curve , demographer Kenneth Grombach predicts that as the dope - friendly baby boom generation takes power from the far more conservative " silent generation " born between 1925 and 1945 , marijuana will become legal " very soon " :
Wait until marijuana is legal .
The former hippies will come out of the woodwork to try a little taste of the weed again .
The Sacramento
Bee conveniently captured one of the main , and most spurious , arguments against legalisation :
Theresa Loya , 43 , of Mariposa , said the bill indirectly could affect children .
" I 'm afraid it would send the wrong message – that drugs are OK , " she said .
Does Ms Loya fear children might get the idea one can smoke some dope and become , say , president of the United States , or the greatest swimmer of all time ?
One hurdle to legalisation : federal law would still outlaw it .
President Barack Obama , who has acknowledged smoking pot in his younger years , has said he does not favour legalisation of marijuana , but has indicated he would end federal drug enforcement agency raids on medical marijuana suppliers in states that allow it .
Since 1996 , 13 states have enacted laws allowing marijuana use for medicinal purposes , according to the Marijuana Policy Project .
California was the first .
Chery Automobile of China introduced a new electric car today called the S18 EV , making the company the second one in China to produce an electric car after BYD which has already unveiled three electric models .
The S18 EV has an electric range of 150 km ( 93 miles ) and a top speed of 120 km / hr ( 74 mph ) .
It has 336V 40 kW electric drive system and a 40 amp - hour lithium - ion phosphate battery pack .
At 220 V it can be fully charged in 4 to 6 hours , and can be 80 % charged in half an hour .
The company has not indicated when mass production would begin or whether it has intentions to sell the car in North America and Europe .

Deala and his girlfriend were sitting in their SUV outside her apartment when he was tragically shot .
Deala died on the way to the hospital .
Investigators are reportedly still trying to determine a motive .
The gunman and accomplice both escaped from the scene .
Pineda , better known as apl.de.ap , was raised along with Deala and their four other siblings in the Philippines .
At the age of fourteen , Pineda moved to the United States and was later adopted by his sponsor through a dollar - a- day program .
Pineda is expected to attend his brother 's funeral .

In early 1979 , NASA awarded space shuttle orbiter manufacturer Rockwell a contract to convert STA - 099 to a space - rated orbiter , OV -099 .
It was completed and delivered in 1982 , after construction and a year of intensive vibration and thermal testing , just as all its sister ships were when they were built .
It was the second operational orbiter to become operational in the space program and had a promising future as a historic workhorse delivering crews and objects to space .
Challenger 's Flight History
On April 4 , 1983 , Challenger launched on her maiden voyage for the STS - 6 mission .
During that time , the first spacewalk of the space shuttle program took place .
The Extra-Vehicular Activity ( EVA ) , performed by astronauts Donald Peterson and Story Musgrave , lasted just over four hours .
The mission also saw the deployment of the first satellite in the Tracking and Data Relay System constellation ( TDRS ) .
These satellites were designed for communications between Earth and space .
The next numerical space shuttle mission for Challenger ( though not in chronological order ) , STS - 7 , launched the first American woman , Sally Ride , into space .
For the STS - 8 launch , which actually occurred before STS - 7 , Challenger was the first orbiter to take off and land at night .
Later , it was the first to carry two U.S. female astronauts on mission STS 41 - G .
It also made the first space shuttle landing at Kennedy Space Center , concluding mission STS 41 - B. Spacelabs 2 and 3 flew aboard the ship on missions STS 51 - F and STS 51 - B , as did the first German - dedicated Spacelab on STS 61 - A .
Challenger once carried a spacelab to orbit for astronauts to use for scientific missions .

Challenger 's Untimely End
After nine successful missions , the Challenger launched on its final mission , STS - 51L on January 28 , 1986 , with seven astronauts aboard .
They were : Gregory Jarvis , Christa McAuliffe , Ronald McNair , Ellison Onizuka , Judith Resnik , Dick Scobee , and Michael J. Smith .
McAuliffe was to be the first teacher in space and had been selected from a field of educators from around the United States .
She had planned a series of lessons to be conducted from space , broadcast to students throughout the U.S .

Seventy - three seconds into the mission , the Challenger exploded , killing the entire crew .
It was the first tragedy of the space shuttle program , followed in 2002 by the loss of the shuttle Columbia .
After a lengthy investigation , NASA concluded that the shuttle was destroyed when an O -ring on a solid rocket booster failed .
The seal design was faulty , and the problem was made worse by unusually cold weather in Florida just prior to launch .
Booster rocket flames passed through the failed seal , and burned through the external fuel tank .
That detached one of the supports that held the booster to the side of the tank .
The booster broke loose and collided with the tank , piercing its side .
Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuels from the tank and booster mixed and ignited , tearing Challenger apart .

Pieces of the shuttle fell into the ocean immediately following the breakup , including the crew cabin .
It was one of the most graphic and publicly viewed disasters of the space program and was filmed from many different angles by NASA and observers .
The space agency began recovery efforts almost immediately , using a fleet of submersibles and Coast Guard cutters .
It took months to recover all the orbiter pieces and the remains of the crew .
In the wake of the disaster , NASA immediately halted all launches .
The restrictions on flight lasted for two years , while the so - called " Rogers Commission " investigated all aspects of the disaster .
Such intense inquiries are part of an accident involving spacecraft and it was important for the agency to understand exactly what happened and take steps to make sure such an accident did n't occur again .

NASA 's Return to Flight
Once the problems that led to the Challenger 's destruction were understood and fixed , NASA resumed shuttle launches on September 29th , 1988 .
It was the seventh flight of the Discovery orbiter
The two - year moratorium on launches put a number of missions back , including the launch and deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope .
In addition , a fleet of classified satellites was also delayed .
It also forced NASA and its contractors to redesign the solid rocket boosters so that they could be safely launched again .
The Challenger Legacy
To memorialize the crew of the lost shuttle , the victims ' families established a series of science education facilities called the Challenger Centers .
These are located around the world and were designed as space education centers , in memory of the crew members , particularly Christa McAuliffe .
The crew has been remembered in movie dedications , their names have been used for craters on the Moon , mountains on Mars , a mountain range on Pluto , and schools , planetarium facilities and even a stadium in Texas .
Musicians , songwriters , and artists have dedicated works in their memories .
The legacy of the shuttle and its lost crew will live on in people 's memory as a tribute to their sacrifice to advance space exploration .
Fast Facts
Space shuttle Challenger was destroyed 73 seconds into launch on January 28 , 1986 .
Seven crew members were killed when the shuttle broke apart in an explosion .
After a two - year delay , NASA resumed launches after an investigation found underlying problems for the agency to solve .

There 's nothing like a recession to turn established wisdom on its head .
Only a few months ago , the idea of big business inviting government interference would have been unthinkable .
Now the queue of supplicants is stretching down Whitehall : banks , car makers , television companies , rail operators , broadband providers , steel producers and the construction industry – all are suddenly demanding billions of pounds of public support .
It could n't come at a worse time , of course .
The banks alone are capable of bankrupting the British state if all of their nightmares were to come true .
If we have to start nationalising the commanding heights of the rest of the economy too , it wo n't just be ideology that will be going out of the window .
It 's a very hard time to say no .
With job losses now running at nearly 80,000 per day , every job that can be saved is priceless .
And of course , no one is rude enough to call for anything as simple as direct government cash .
Even the car industry dresses up its pleas for money in more sophisticated language : asking for credit guarantees and other measures to stimulate spending .
At the other end of the scale , many regulated businesses are just using the crisis to negotiate better terms at the expense of consumers and taxpayers .
The railway industry wants to turn its system of franchises into a one way bet .
In each case , the implicit threat is to disrupt vital services if business does n't get its way .
Give Channel 4 money , or Big Brother gets it .
Even BT is at it , questioning whether it can now afford to invest in broadband infrastructure .
The final straw came today when even PFI companies who specialise in taking risk away from the public sector start asking for money .
Taken individually , many of these industries have a case .
But do n't be fooled – all these pleas for help will cost us money .
And not every industry pleading penury is quite a broke as it looks .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel said on Saturday it would not agree to a ceasefire with the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip unless an Israeli soldier held by the Islamists was freed .
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s office said in a statement : “ The prime minister ’s position is that Israel will not reach understandings on a truce before the release of Gilad Shalit . ”
Israel wants to tie any ceasefire deal with Hamas in Gaza to the release of soldier Shalit , held captive in the Palestinian enclave since 2006 when he was kidnapped in a cross - border raid .
Egypt is mediating a long - term ceasefire between Israel and Hamas .
Israeli media reported significant headway had been achieved in the indirect talks .
Hamas spokesman in Gaza Fawzi Barhoum told Reuters that the Egyptian - mediated talks were stalled by disagreement on the duration of the ceasefire .
Israel wants a permanent ceasefire while Hamas favors an 18 - month truce that could be extended .
“ Once this obstacle is overcome an announcement would be made , ” Barhoum said .
Hamas has rejected Israeli demands to include the fate of Shalit in the ceasefire agreement .
The Islamist group wants Israel to open all border crossings with the Gaza Strip as a condition for talks on the release of Shalit .
Hamas has demanded the release of hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli jails in exchange for Shalit .
Distant , massive planets may still support life when their host stars become bloated red giants ( Illustration : ESO )
Large and distant ocean worlds could provide a last refuge for life around Sun - like stars , long after the heat of the stars ’ red giant phase sterilises closer - in , Earth - like planets , new calculations suggest .
Stars similar in mass to the Sun swell to become red giants at the end of their lives , engulfing their inner planets and roasting slightly more distant ones .
The Sun itself is scheduled to enter this phase around 5 billion years from now , which should bake to death any remaining life here even before the planet is swallowed up altogether .
Far - sighted researchers have dreamed up outlandish schemes to allow future civilisations to move the Earth to a safe distance .
But new calculations suggest life could naturally hang on in more remote locales around red giants , reinforcing similar results from an earlier but less detailed study .
Advertisement
The new study focuses on the conditions needed for photosynthesis , including an atmosphere with enough carbon dioxide to support the process , and a temperature that would allow liquid water to exist on the planet ’s surface .
The study was led by Werner von Bloh of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany .
Warm cores
Life on planets the size of Earth would die off before the red giant phase begins , the team argues .
That ’s because the planet ’s cooling core would stop the volcanic activity needed to replenish atmospheric carbon dioxide , which is gradually removed by the formation of carbon - containing rocks .
Plants would thus run out of CO 2 needed for photosynthesis .
But the cores of bigger planets , called super - Earths , would stay warm for longer , allowing CO 2 to persist in their atmospheres .
Recent discoveries suggest that super - Earths are common around other stars .
Those that start out farther from their parent star than Earth might be frozen during the star ’s youth and middle - age .
But they would thaw out later , as the star ’s habitable zone – where temperatures are right for liquid water – moves outwards as the red giant phase progresses and the star ’s size and brightness grow .
Sweet spot
Where would a planet have to lie to enjoy habitable conditions for the longest amount of time during this process ?
Around a star with the Sun ’s mass , the ‘ sweet spot ’ would lie a little beyond the orbit of Mars , at around twice the Earth - Sun distance , the team says .
An ocean - dominated super - Earth would be best , because it would be best able to hold onto its CO 2 atmosphere , the team says .
The reactions that convert CO 2 into carbon - containing rocks , and thus remove it from the atmosphere , require land exposed to air to function , so they slow down when exposed land is scarce .
A 10 Earth - mass planet at twice the Earth - Sun distance – whose surface was also 90 % covered by water – would be in the red giant ’s habitable zone for 3.7 billion years , the team says .
That ’s almost as long as life has existed on Earth , if the oldest and still controversial evidence is to be believed .
Too hot ?
A 2005 study led by Bruno Lopez of the Observatoire de la Cote d’Azur in Nice , France , came to similar conclusions about the habitability of relatively distant planets , but relied on older data on how Sun - like stars evolve , and did not investigate the role of planet mass and fraction of ocean coverage .
William Danchi of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , US , who was involved in the 2005 study but not the new one , says the new results bolster the case for including red giants in searches for habitable planets .
Though close - in planets would be sterilised by the red giant , “ maybe there ’s a new burst of life around a super - Earth farther away ” , he says .
But James Kasting of Pennsylvania State University , who was not involved in either study , questions the assumptions underlying the new calculations , including setting the optimal temperature for photosynthesis - based life at 50° C , halfway between boiling and freezing .
“ 50° C would be almost uninhabitable for anything that lives on Earth except for some kinds of bacteria , ” he says , pointing out that Earth ’s average surface temperature is around 15° C .

With lawmakers still unable to deliver a budget after three days of intense negotiations , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger prepared to lay off 10,000 government workers and his administration said it would halt the last 275 state - funded public works projects still in operation .
The projects , which cost $ 3.8 billion and include upgrades to 18 bridges and roads in Los Angeles County to protect them from collapsing in earthquakes , had been allowed to continue as others were suspended because the state was running out of cash .
The projects to be suspended today had been exempted from a November stop order because of the significant financial cost of canceling contracts , the expense of resuming them or the public - health or public - safety ramifications .
The list also includes work to eliminate arsenic in the Central Valley town of Live Oak and half - built highway construction projects .
Schwarzenegger had delayed sending out pink slips since Friday , hoping that lawmakers would soon approve a budget .
But they failed Monday to find a third GOP vote in the state Senate to achieve the two - thirds majority needed to pass a budget -- a requirement that essentially gives the minority Republicans veto power .
A spokesman for Schwarzenegger said layoff notices would go out today .

Late Monday evening , both houses of the Legislature adjourned and Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) ordered senators back to the chamber at 10 a.m. today , saying they would stay until a budget passed .
“ Bring a toothbrush , ” he said .
“ I will not allow anyone to go home to resume their lives or any kind of normal business . ”
State Sen. Abel Maldonado ( R - Santa Maria ) was viewed as the most likely candidate to provide the final vote , but by Monday evening legislative leaders had not agreed to his demands .
The dominant Democrats need three Republican votes in each house to pass the budget ; leaders in the Assembly said the votes were available in the lower house .
Assemblyman Mike Villines of Clovis and Sen. Dave Cogdill of Modesto , the two GOP leaders in the Legislature , told their members last week that the deal they helped forge was the strongest Republicans could get .
But most GOP lawmakers have taken an antitax pledge , and the package relies on $ 14.4 billion in tax hikes to plug a nearly $ 42 - billion budget hole .

The challenge of rounding up the handful of Republican votes has shown how strong the resistance to taxes remains in California politics .
In the Assembly , Republicans Roger Niello of Fair Oaks and Anthony Adams of Hesperia have agreed to join Villines in supporting the higher sales , income and gas taxes that are part of the package , legislators said .
The move carries significant political risk .
Niello , who worked in his family ’s Sacramento County auto dealership before entering politics , will be forced from the Assembly next year by term limits .
He is seeking to run for one of the most conservative state Senate districts , and faces a primary against a fellow assemblyman who would undoubtedly bludgeon Niello as being in favor of taxes .
Niello refused to publicly commit his vote , saying simply that it “ will be based on the total package -- and right now , not all the details are nailed down . ”
Advertisement
Legislative leaders said Niello agreed to support the package because he is the senior Republican on the Assembly budget panel .
By political custom , lawmakers in such positions vote for budgets that their leaders recommend .
Adams , a bearded 37 - year - old who was elected in 2006 after working for San Bernardino County as its legislative liaison to Sacramento and Washington , has said he would provide the Assembly ’s third GOP vote .
“ It ’s unconscionable that we let this state go over the cliff , ” Adams said in an interview .
“ My job is to get the best possible deal for Republicans . ”
Adams faces reelection next year , and his support for the budget package has antitax advocates interested in lining up a challenger in the GOP primary .
And because he represents a swing district , Adams must also worry about a general - election challenge from a Democrat .
Adams said he had not asked for specific concessions for his vote , or for assurances that he would get assistance to fend off election challenges .

“ I ’m not trying to find some soft landing , ” he said , “ although my wife is going to kill me if she hears that . ”
The political repercussions for Villines are the least intimidating .
A gregarious former Capitol staffer and public relations man , he easily brushed back a weekend attempt to topple him as leader of the Assembly ’s 29 Republicans .
He is in his last term in the Assembly , and the state Senate and Congress seats he may be eyeing are held by incumbents with no immediate plans to vacate them .
Like Cogdill , his Senate counterpart , Villines has argued that Republicans extracted substantial concessions as they negotiated the budget package .
Those include $ 15.1 billion in cuts to government services , tax breaks for corporations and a greater role for private contractors in state building projects .
The GOP leaders also won agreement from Democrats to place on the May 19 ballot a measure to limit future lawmakers from splurging the next time the state ’s treasury becomes plump , as they did during the dot - com and housing booms .

Cogdill , a taciturn former real estate appraiser from a conservative Central Valley area , has had difficulty winning over two of the other 14 GOP senators .
That small caucus has gone through repeated internal power battles in recent years , and the ambitions of some of its members toward statewide offices has made it hard to find volunteers to break the party ’s antitax mantra .
“ The Senate is just a bit more independently minded than the Assembly , ” said Kevin Eckery , a former press secretary for then - Gov. Pete Wilson , who like Schwarzenegger reluctantly agreed to raise taxes .
“ These are guys who , given their own set of personal convictions , just cannot justify a large tax increase during the worst recession in 35 years . ”
GOP Sen .
Roy Ashburn of Bakersfield has agreed to vote for the package , according to legislative officials .
This is Ashburn ’s last term in the Legislature , so he does not have to worry about reelection .
And he has voted for tax increases before , during his 12 years as a Kern County supervisor .
Ashburn wrangled from legislative leaders a new tax credit intended to help home builders .
It would allow people buying newly constructed homes a state tax credit of 5 % of the purchase price or $ 10,000 , whichever is lower .
The credit would be spread over three tax years and be given out on a first - come basis until the state had parted with $ 100 million .
Advertisement
Ashburn declined Monday to confirm that he would vote for the budget package but said the state was in “ an extraordinarily difficult situation ” and “ there are no easy answers . ”
Leaders had initially wooed Sen. Dave Cox of Fair Oaks as the final Republican vote .
He had publicly declared , as recently as last week , “ We can not close this budget gap with cuts alone . ”
At 70 years old and in his last term , he presumably does not have to worry about political retribution .
And his district includes sections of Sacramento , where many state workers face the prospect of layoffs .
But Cox announced Saturday that he would not vote for the package , and negotiators turned much of their attention to Maldonado .
The GOP ’s only Latino senator , Maldonado , like Adams , represents a swing district and voted for the state budget in 2007 .
Advertisement
On Monday , Maldonado said he would “ take a look at ” voting for the budget package if it included financial penalties for future legislators who fail to pass state budgets on time or drive the state into deficit .
And Maldonado , who lost a 2006 bid for state controller to a more conservative challenger , said he wants future California primary elections to be “ open , ” allowing voters to cross party lines to cast a ballot .
Though widely believed to want to run again for statewide office , Maldonado said in an interview : “ An open primary is for the people of California , it ’s not for me .
I do n’t want anything in this budget that ’s for me .
I ’m not for sale . ”

Get updates impacting your industry from our GigaOm Research Community
InstantAction today officially unveiled its technology platform , which purportedly makes it possible to play any video game in a web browser .
Not just 2D casual games , but hardcore 3D games with high - end graphics that would otherwise require a next - gen game console , or a huge client install on the PC .
Even , say , World of Warcraft , played in a browser ?
Yes , an InstantAction spokesperson assured me , “ Any game . ”
How about the Microsoft ( s msft ) Xbox 360 hit Gears of War ?
Instant Action Technology V - P Brett Seyler told me last week during a demo that if the company got Microsoft ’s ( s msft ) approval , his company could convert Gears for web - based play in “ 2 - 3 weeks , max . ”
Neither of those games or other well - known titles were shown to me at the demo , but I did get hands - on time with some of the nine internally developed 3D games InstantAction has been hosting on its site during beta , and they are pretty impressive .
For instance , Fallen Empire : Legions , offers fast - paced , first - person shooter action , while Ace of Aces gives you realistic WWI - themed dogfights ; in both cases , you get a full 3D gaming experience that just happens to be on the web .
Download and install the small 150 K plug - in , download a particular game in a matter of minutes , and you ’re ready to play .
How does it work ?
Seyler would n’t elaborate other than to say that the game runs as a separate process from the web browser , via what he called the company ’s proprietary “ secret sauce , ” which applies API hooks to the code of any game engine .
This process does require a 3D graphics card , but Seyler told me even low - end processors can handle the job .
( The platform is derived from game engine company GarageGames , which IAC / InterActiveCorp ( s iaci ) bought in 2007 . )
InstantAction execs tell me they ’re in talks with “ pretty much every big [ game ] publisher , ” and to expect deals to be announced this year or 2010 .
If their technology is as robust as they claim , I expect a number of them .
However , it remains to be seen how many 3D game publishers are ready to move away from the retail software sales model and re-package their titles as integrated web experiences .
Doing so will probably require them to embrace new revenue models that better suit casual web play , such as advertising and microtransactions .
Then again , considering the high number of web game players , and the skyrocketing costs of high - end 3D games , they may find themselves with little choice .
Bedazzle Your Bash Prompt with Git Info
I have seen this around and this morning finally decided to try it out .
Thus far I am finding it surprisingly helpful .
If you put the following in your bash profile , it will show the current git branch in your terminal prompt .
bash profile addition
function parse_git_branch { ref=$( git-symbolic -ref HEAD 2 > / dev/null ) || return echo " ( " ${ref#refs / heads / } " ) " } PS1 = " \w \ $( parse_git_branch ) \$ "
If you are not in a directory that is a git repository it will just provide a normal prompt but if you are in a directory with a git repo , you ’ll get a prompt like the following , even when you switch branches :
~/dev/projects / httparty ( master ) $ gb integration * master ~/ dev/ projects / httparty ( master ) $ git co integration Switched to branch " integration " ~/dev/ projects / httparty ( integration ) $
Pretty handy , eh ?
I actually bedazzled mine a bit more with color and the current time like this :
bedazzled bash profile addition
function parse_git_branch { ref=$( git-symbolic -ref HEAD 2 > / dev/null ) || return echo " ( " ${ref#refs / heads / } " ) " } RED= " \[ \033 [ 0;31 m\ ] " YELLOW= " \[ \033 [ 0;33 m\ ] " GREEN= " \[ \033 [ 0;32 m\ ] "
PS1 = " $RED \$ ( date + %H : %M ) \w$ YELLOW \$( parse_git_branch ) $ GREEN\$ "
Here is a screenshot of my prompt .
Hawt .
Light red blends into the black so as not to stand out .
The yellow does standout , but that is because the current branch is more important to me than the directory I am in .
The green color and black background is from the Homebrew theme in Terminal ( requires Leopard ) .
The reason I added the time is that I do not include the time in my menu bar .
If you do n’t like the colors I chose , you can pick from a list .
Try this out if you have n’t yet , I guarantee you will dig it .
For those of you out there that use a different shell ( zsh , etc. ) , feel free to post how to do the same in the comments .
Two weeks ago I wrote a post about why I think we should not talk politics in the office .
I argued that :
“ your political preferences will most likely pigeonhole you into one [ ideological ] group and others will form opinions about you based on where you fit .
To me , this is the danger in expressing personal beliefs in the workplace .
It can take the focus from your professional accomplishments and redirect it on your personal life , no matter how brilliant you are at your job . ”
Fellow Brazen Careerist blogger , Rebecca Thorman of Modite countered with :
“ What we believe in and have faith in informs our work and personal lives intimately , and to say that we should n’t discuss them anywhere is dangerous …
And while voicing your opinion may invite all sorts of opinions and criticism and the chance that you might – gasp !
– have to defend your beliefs , we cannot have as our legacy a production that mindlessly follows the corporate establishment . ”
While I admire Rebecca ’s courage to speak her mind and I think she makes some good points , my cynical side has been presented with an example as to why such righteous idealism ( “ I will know that I never , ever regretted opening my mouth , only keeping it shut . ” ) sounds a lot better in theory than in practice .
Free Speech in Action
My friend , the same one I referenced in The Separation of Work and State , decided to engage a co-worker in a political discussion about why she was choosing to vote for John McCain for President .
My Friend : “ So why are you voting for McCain ? ”
Co-Worker : “ I do n’t trust Obama . ”
My Friend : “ Why not ? ”
Co-Worker : “ Well , he says he ’s half black .
But his father is from Africa , which is close to the Middle East , so I heard he is really part Arab .
This means that Obama is really more Arab than he is black . ”
My Friend : “ Oh ? ”
Co-Worker : “ It ’s ok that he ’s Arab , but why is hiding it from everyone ?
I do n’t trust him . ”
A Moral Dilema
My friend is now embroiled in somewhat of a moral dilemma as he now suspects his co-worker is :
a ) severely misinformed / ignorant
b ) racist against people of Middle Eastern descent
c ) racist against people of African descent
I have no doubt that this woman is a competent employee who does a good job .
But by sharing this side of her personality ( in a non-work related context ) has made her co-workers view her in a very different and unflattering light .
My friend ultimately chose not to argue with his co-worker but if we are supposed to fully express our beliefs no matter the consequence , should n’t he have spoken up to correct her ?
Would she have changed her mind if he did ?
If they had argued , would any lasting animosity affect their professional relationship ?
The First Amendment
I understand that a central tenant of America ’s freedom is the exercise of personal speech without persecution .
As a blogger , I can acutely appreciate the gravity of losing this freedom and consider myself lucky that I an write whatever I want without fear of being jailed ( like bloggers in Egypt , Malaysia or Morrocco .
However , any idea , no matter good / bad / right / wrong , will always be subject to critics .
Let ’s not discount that it ’s much harder to have to work side - by - side with your critics everyday than to sit miles and miles away from them at a computer .

Moreover , they claim to be the only church in America that understands the Bible !
In fact , neither is true .
Landover Baptist is a fraud .
A joke .
Their true purpose is not to spread the Gospel of our Lord , but to trick people - especially those who have not received the Word and Salvation or have been programmed by secular culture to distrust Christianity - into believing that Christianity is evil and rejecting it .
For this blasphemous atrocity , the Landover Baptist website must be removed from our Internet .

BEWARE OF IMPERSONATORS !
Due to our recent successes in working towards the inevitable shutdown of the Landover site , certain elements in the anti-Christian movement have decided to launch a character assassination campaign against Jim Carlson and other OBJECTIVE : Ministries members .
This campaign is being waged in the Landover guestbook , as well as forums on third party websites , and consists of impersonated messages involving all manner of obscenities .

Chris Harper shortly after expulsion from Liberty University for anti-Christian hate crimes .
Landover Baptist is run by an organization that calls itself - no doubt in gleeful mockery of Our Lord - Americhrist Ltd .
Its leader is a shadowy figure named Chris Harper who apparently has a history of anti-Christian bigotry .
Although Landover Baptist claims to own vast properties and have thousands of members , in reality it exists only on the Internet and it's membership is quite small .
Their modus operandi is simple : post articles that take good Christian values and twist them - beyond recognition - such that they look arrogant , hateful , or just idiotic .
To this they add a continuous mockery of The Lord and Salvation , such as portraying Jesus Christ as the captain of a decadent cruise ship or offering a free cellphone as a reward for those who become saved - demeaning the value of Salvation to that of some material trinket !
Landover Baptist also targets our youth .
They regularly do articles about some pop-culture entertainment that has a loyal teen or preteen following ( such as the singing group In Sync , who are in fact Christians ) that contain intentional lies and slanders designed specifically to cause those youthful and naive fans to consider the authors of the articles to be either idiots or evil or both - and they do this in the appropriated name of our Lord !
This predictably causes the fans to come to the site ( Landover 's followers make sure to notify fans of the atrocity by placing forged announcements on their fansite message boards ) ; view the many inappropriate , hate - filled articles ; and come away infected with anti-Christian propaganda .
All of this has the result of replacing , in the minds of hapless non-Christian visitors , the teachings of Our Lord with the false and purposely distasteful teachings of Chris Harper and his band of hatemongers .
Those who do not end up rejecting Christianity because of this site will end up accepting evil lies in Christianity 's place .
Either way , the devil wins .
Furthermore , it is clear that they do not want people to know their true goals .
For example , their guestbook is set to asterisk - out words like " joke " , " satire " , " parody " , " anti-christian " , and - most tellingly - " Satan " so that any Christian who tries to inform naive visitors of the truth ends up sounding like a foul - mouthed , raving loon .
They also filter out " Americhrist " , obviously to keep their connections to Atheist militants a secret !
NEWS FLASH !
If you had any doubts as to the affiliation of the creator of Landover Baptist check out this link which shows pictures from an Atheist convention that " Reverend " Chris Harper was a key speaker at with other anti-Christian blackguards such as Douglas Adams and Dave " Mephistopheles " Kong !
Take Action :
Our cause is in its infancy and we are still growing .
So far we have a membership of over 100 concerned and motivated Christians who are willing to do whatever it takes to shut down Landover , but we still need your help .
Please take the time to join our cause and show the world that intolerance and hatred towards Christianity will be met with determined resistance !
If you have any more information that can help us in our cause or wish to join , you may contact OBJECTIVE : Landover Baptist Shutdown at :
Things we can do :
Prayer .
It is our best weapon against the anti-Christian forces .
We must pray not only that the Lord will intervene on behalf of the unsaved who are being damaged by Americhrist Ltd. , but also for the souls of those same unsaved .
Furthermore , we must pray that Chris Harper and his fellow hatemongers will themselves be saved and cease in their evil actions .

Petitions !
If none of this works , we must inform the authorities of this obvious instance of anti-Christian hate crime , which is illegal in most areas .
If it is n't illegal , we must pressure our congressmen to make it so !
Also , you should inform the pastor of your church so that he may inform the congregation , allowing our grass - roots campaign to grow .
Chris Harper and his cowardly supporters are no match for the determined will of good Christians when they join together for a righteous cause !

NEW YORK - Two years after the debut of a controversial public school focusing on Arabic language and culture , a Hebrew language charter school is opening in New York City , stoking further debate about the purpose of a public school education .
Backers of the Hebrew Language Academy Charter School , slated to open this fall , say it will appeal to diverse ethnic and religious groups and not just Jews .
But critics here and elsewhere around the nation question whether public schools should celebrate one particular culture .
" They 're trying to transmit cultural values and identity , and that 's not the purpose of a public school , " said Michael Meyers , executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition .
Last month the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit over a school in Minnesota that caters to Muslim students , and a Hebrew charter school in Florida has spurred debates over church - state separation .
New York City 's Hebrew charter school is planned for the Mill Basin neighborhood of Brooklyn , which has a substantial number of Jews , including immigrants from the former Soviet Union but is three - quarters black , Hispanic and Asian .
Sara Berman , chairwoman of the school 's board , said Jewish and non-Jewish students alike will benefit from learning Hebrew .
" We really believe that learning a second language helps children in other ways besides the language itself , " she said , citing studies that suggest that language instruction stimulates brain development .
The state Board of Regents approved the Hebrew charter school on Jan. 13 with one dissenting vote .
" Any opportunity for your child to learn a second language , whether it 's Hebrew or any other language , is beneficial , " said Maureen Gonzalez - Campbell , the principal , who is African - American and speaks no Hebrew herself .
Gonzalez - Campbell , 48 , said parents will be attracted to the charter school 's low student - teacher ratio - there will be one English - speaking teacher and one Hebrew - speaking teacher in each classroom - and academic rigor .
The Hebrew charter school , which does not have a site yet , is due to open with 150 students in kindergarten and first grade and will grow to 450 in grades K - 5 .
Like other charter schools , it will be taxpayer - funded .
But it expects to raise additional money from private donors and has commitments of $ 500,000 a year from philanthropist Michael Steinhardt and $ 250,000 a year from the Charles and Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation .
Steinhardt , the father of Berman , the school 's chairwoman , founded the Steinhardt Foundation for Jewish Life in 1994 with the goal of revitalizing Jewish identity .
But Berman said the charter school will not promote the Jewish religion , instead using secular texts to teach modern Hebrew .
Berman , whose own children attend a Jewish day school in Manhattan , is a former columnist for the New York Sun , a now - defunct daily that led the opposition to the Khalil Gibran International Academy , with its curriculum emphasizing the study of Arabic language and culture .
That school opened in September 2007 after its first choice for a principal , Debbie Almontaser , was forced to resign over comments she had made about the word " intifada . "
Critics said Almontaser should have condemned the use of the word , which commonly refers to the Palestinian uprising against Israel , on T - shirts made by a youth organization .
Almontaser has sued to get her job back ; the lawsuit is pending .
Controversy arose more recently in Minnesota , where the ACLU sued over the Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy , a charter school with two campuses in the Minneapolis - St.
Paul area .
The ACLU contends that the Minnesota school violates the separation of church and state by permitting prayer sessions during school hours and by giving preference to Muslim clothing rules .
Female teachers , for example , have to be covered from neck to wrist and ankle .
The Brooklyn Hebrew school will not be the nation 's first Hebrew charter school .
The Ben Gamla Hebrew Charter School in Hollywood , Fla. , prompted fierce debates when it opened in 2007 .
It serves kosher meals and its director is a rabbi , but an expert hired by the district deemed Ben Gamla 's lesson plans " entirely appropriate for a publicly funded charter school . "
The Brooklyn school satisfied the New York state regents that it will not violate the U.S. Constitution , but critics have n't been silenced .
Diane Ravitch , a professor of education at New York University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , said in an op - ed piece in New York 's Daily News that she objected to the Hebrew school for the same reasons she objected to the Khalil Gibran school , because a public school should not be " centered on the teaching of a single non-American culture . "
" We do n't send children to public schools to learn to be Chinese or Russian or Greek or Korean , " Ravitch said .
" We send them to learn to be American . "
Spanish scientists have shown how elaborately curved crystalline structures , similar to those typically made by living organisms , can grow from simple solutions of metal carbonates .
The work provides potentially important new insights into the phenomenon of biomineralisation , in which organisms control the incorporation of minerals into complex structures such as shells and bones .
A group led by Juan Manuel Garc ?
a- Ruiz of the Instituto Andaluz do Ciencas de la Tierra has captured on film the growth of an array of smoothly curved crystalline shapes that emerged from a mixture of barium or strontium carbonate and silica in an alkaline medium .
Most natural crystals , such as quartz or pyrites , are faceted solids , Garc ?
a - Ruiz says .
’ But when life uses a mineral , such as calcium phosphate for bones or calcium carbonate for shells , these create curved forms that are forbidden in the world of crystals , ’ he adds .
Now , Garc ?
a- Ruiz and his colleagues have proposed an explanation for how such curved crystalline structures can be spontaneously generated .
As the carbonate crystal starts to form , the removal of carbonate from the surrounding solution causes the pH of the medium to drop in the immediate vicinity of the growing crystal .
This then favours precipitation of silica , which forms a sheath around the carbonate crystal .
The precipitation of the silica in turn raises the pH - promoting crystallisation of the carbonate .
The cycle is continuously repeated , with nanocrystals of carbonate being formed and coated in silica , thanks to the oscillating pH at the growing crystal front .
The team ’s images reveal that the crystal grows in a series of distinct phases .
The initial nanocrystalline composite forms a dendritic structure which resembles a cauliflower .
Then , for reasons that are not clear , a flat disc - like protrusion emerges from the structure .
This two - dimensional leaf , consisting of partially aligned nanocrystals of silica - encapsulated carbonate , continues to grow outwards until a curl begins to form .
’ At a point on the advancing front of this disc a curl appears , ’ says Garc ? a - Ruiz .
’ This curl travels along the edge like a surf wave . ’
The curl introduces a third dimension to the structure , and when it meets another curl they can interact in a variety of ways , from which different curved 3D patterns emerge , such as helicoids .
The final form of the crystal depends on a variety of factors , such as the diameter of the curl and the velocity of the advancing front .
Two big questions remain to be answered , says Garc ?
a - Ruiz : how and why a two - dimensional protrusion emerges from the dendritic growth of the nanocrystals , and what instigates the formation of a curl at a given point on the edge of this disc .
Stephen Mann of the University of Bristol in the UK is a leading authority
on the self - assembly of crystalline materials .
’ These phenomena have been seen extensively , but what this work has done is present a nice , coherent explanation for a whole range of structures based on an underlying mechanism of pH oscillation along with macroscopic folding .
Together these produce a library of shapes which on
the face of it appear to have little connection between them . ’

Why must the Confederate banner come down ?
Because it is the battle flag of white cowards ,
And those angry that white privilege is ending
By Douglas A. Blackmon
When I was a Boy Scout in Leland , Mississippi , my patrol in Troop 42 called itself “ the Rebels ” during 1976 .
I still have locked in a trunk somewhere little wooden blocks I painted with the names of each scout imposed over a crude image of the Confederate battle flag–a wall decoration [… ]
One of the world ’s leading art dealers this week launched an astonishing attack on the contemporary art market , condemning the millions charged for some works as “ almost fraud ” .
The comments from David Nahmad , a Monaco - based dealer who is possibly the biggest in the world , come as art buyers reel from the collapse of the contemporary market .
They echo remarks by the British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro , who last week said that “ stupid outrageous values ” had become more important than the work itself .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Nahmad , who is reputed to have a £ 2bn collection of some 5,000 paintings , including 300 Picassos , told The Independent on Sunday : “ There are a lot of embarrassed people who bought art that is now not worth what they paid for it .
For the past three or four years it ’s been a very , very thin market , with just two or three buyers pushing up prices by bidding against each other .
“ Unfortunately , a lot of people knew the game .
So those people who did not know are realising it now .
It ’s almost a fraud .
I would never advise my clients to buy contemporary art . ”
Mr Nahmad and his family have made billions of dollars trading art .
They specialise in the works of great modern artists such as Picasso , Matisse and Rothko .
He added that he does n’t think any artist since Francis Bacon had pushed art forward .
The last notable artists were Lucio Fontana and Yves Klein , he said .
“ There is the real art market , with real artists , and then there is the stupid art market which uses publicity to make some artists become very expensive .
That does n’t mean they are good .
Damien
Hirst ’s diamond skull at $ 100 m was a stupid thing ; $ 100 m is an offence .
Hirst started with $ 10,000 – that ’s OK .
But $ 100 m ?
That ’s ridiculous . ”
Last week Sir Anthony Caro , 84 , one of Britain ’s greatest living artists , bemoaned the fact that the market value of paintings had become more meaningful to artists than creating beautiful work .
“ Some art has got some stupid , outrageous values and it is very sad that money has become a very important part of the art world , ” he said at the opening of a new sculpture exhibition in Monterrey , Mexico .
“ Because of this crisis , something will change in art and there may be a rethinking of value .
In my time , art was never about money .
I am not a millionaire .
I have tried to make good art . ”
Louisa Buck , a columnist for The Art Newspaper , disagreed .
“ There is no doubt that the likes of Rothko , Picasso and Matisse are magisterial figures , ” she said .
“ But the art world has moved on and to dismiss everything after Bacon is utter nonsense .
The contemporary market has been subject to extreme speculation , but there is a difference between speculation and fraud .
The economic downturn will moderate the speculative bubble that has seen some less deserving artists command extreme prices . ”
Over half the self service rental bicycles in Paris have been stolen A popular bicycle rental scheme in Paris that has transformed travel in the city has run into problems just 18 months after its successful launch .
Over half the original fleet of 15,000 specially made bicycles have disappeared , presumed stolen .
They have been used 42 million times since their introduction but vandalism and theft are taking their toll .
The company which runs the scheme , JCDecaux , says it can no longer afford to operate the city - wide network .
Championed by Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe , the bikes were part of an attempt to " green " the capital .
Parisians took to them enthusiastically .
But the bikes have suffered more than anticipated , company officials have said .
Vélib extreme
Hung from lamp posts , dumped in the River Seine , torched and broken into pieces , maintaining the network is proving expensive .
Some have turned up in eastern Europe and Africa , according to press reports .
Since the scheme 's launch , nearly all the original bicycles have been replaced at a cost of 400 euros ( $ 519 , £ 351 ) each .
The Velib bikes - the name is a contraction of velo ( cycle ) and liberte ( freedom ) - have also fallen victim to a craze known as " velib extreme " .
PARIS CYCLE SCHEME IN NUMBERS 20,000 bicycles 1,250 stations Cost 400 euros each to replace 7,800 " disappeared " 11,600 vandalised 1,500 daily repairs Staff recover 20 abandoned bikes a day Each bike travels 10,000 km a year 42 million users since launch Source : Velib Various videos have appeared on YouTube showing riders taking the bikes down the steps in Montmartre , into metro stations and being tested on BMX courses .
Remi Pheulpin , JCDecaux 's director general , says the current contract is unsustainable .
" It 's simple .
All the receipts go to the city .
All the expenses are ours , " he said .
The costs , he said , were " so high that a private business cannot handle it alone , especially as it's a problem of public order .
If we want the velib set - up to keep going , we 'll have to change the business model , " he told Le Parisien newspaper .
Customised
The original contract gave the advertising company a 10 - year licence to exploit 1,600 city - wide billboards in return for running the scheme , plus a share in the revenue , estimated at 20 m euros for the first year of operation .
City hall has recently agreed to pay towards the costs of replacing the stolen or trashed bicycles but is refusing to bail out the company .
Not all the bicycles receive rough treatment however .
One velib repairman reported finding one of the bikes customised with fur covered tyres .
The scheme was modelled on one in Lyon , which appears to have been less troublesome , and has been extended to other cities in France .
It is also being copied overseas with London , San Francisco and Singapore all intending to set up similar schemes .

Update :
There are a couple of stories floating around about Chris Berman ’s propensity to sweat on a humid golf course .
How about Berman getting sweaty while chatting up the ladies .
Worse for a man : swamp ass or soaked comb-over and drenched spine ?
Go .
Who up for the “ 2 Minute Drill ? ”
Just dropped onto the Internets are these shots from the 2007 Jim Kelly Celebrity Gala , some golf outing where famous people raise money for charity .
It ’s a good cause where the celebs hit the course early where booze is readily available .
At the turn they suck down a couple meat missiles and finish the round with shots , mixed drinks and karaoke which goes into the wee hours .
Enter Chris Berman , your sweaty hero who grabs the mic , puts on his goofy glasses and impresses the women with his soaked neckline , back and ass crack .
Oh , and Mr. Belding was there , too .
Doing a little air drumming ?
This photo dump would have been a little better if Berman was dancing with some chick backing that ass up on the legendary ESPNer .
Ooops , there she is .
Blurry , yes .
But enjoying some Berman leg action ?
Very much so .
Someone needs to wear white the next time .

55 Dems ( plus Hoyer ? ) want " regular order "
A group of about 55 Democrats , many of them members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog caucus , are imploring their leadership in the House to change controversial rules intended to bypass lengthy committee hearings and amendments .
In recent months , Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suspended " regular order " to fast - track huge bills , including the bank bailouts and the stimulus package -- angering many committee and subcommittee chairs who resented being shut out of decision - making .
The group is appealing to Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , who is close to the Blue Dogs , complaining such actions are an invitation to the kind of abuses seen during more than a decade of " one-party Republican rule , " according to a draft letter intended for Hoyer .
Hoyer , who is sympathetic , is expected to take their request up with Pelosi .
" We strongly share the view that regular order is important to both the House institutionally and to moving the strongest possible agenda for the American people , " said a person close to Hoyer .
The Democrats , including moderate Jim Cooper ( D - Tenn ) and liberal Peter DeFazio , have n't sent the missive and are hoping for a modification of the rules before they take their complaints public , a Democratic aide told Politico .
Cooper made the Blue Dog case to the Democratic caucus on Monday , telling Politico 's Alex Isenstadt , " They really do n’t care what Blue Dogs think ...
There ’s huge frustration . ”
The letter 's existence was first reported by The Hill late Monday .
“ Committees must function thoroughly and inclusively , and cooperation must ensue between the parties and the houses to ensure that our legislative tactics enable rather than impede progress , ” the members wrote .
“ In general , we must engender an atmosphere that allows partisan games to cease and collaboration to succeed . "
A Pelosi spokesman did n't immediately return a request for comment .

DETROIT —
After enduring a brutal sales slump caused by high gas prices and a faltering economy , the last thing the American auto industry needed was a credit crisis .
But with banks tightening up their lending , any hope for a recovery in vehicle sales this year has been dashed .
The virtual lockdown on credit is hurting Detroit ’s Big Three and other automakers at every level .
More consumers can not get auto loans .
Dealers are hard - pressed to secure financing for new inventories .
The auto companies themselves are running short of cash and can hardly afford to borrow more at interest rates as high as 20 percent .
It all adds up to an increasingly dismal forecast for the industry .
Vehicle sales fell 11 percent in the first eight months of the year compared with 2007 .
But September sales , which automakers will report Wednesday , are expected to be down as much as 19 percent , according to the auto research Web site Edmunds.com .
Aging is what geneticists like to call a “ complex trait ” — simply put , a trait that is controlled by a large number of genes and the interactions between them .
Complex traits differ from simple traits in the following way :
When one is studying a simple trait , one simply identifies a mutant in the relevant trait and , after an ingenious combination of clever crosses and muscular cloning steps , finds the defective gene — thus gaining a great deal of explanatory power about the trait in question .
When one is studying a complex trait , however , approaches like a mutant screen fall short .
They do n’t fall totally flat — one of the great innovations of the last decade or so is the realization that we can learn quite a bit by studying aging at the single - gene level — but they ca n’t get us all the way home .
Suppose you do a screen and find fifty mutants that all lengthen lifespan by forty percent ( not far from the situation in worm ) — or , speaking more generally about complex traits , you find fifty loci in the human genome that are associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia .
What then ?
What have you really learned about how the system works ?
In order to really get a handle on complex traits like aging , we need new tools — not only to discover genes involved in our favorite traits , but also the interactions between the gene ’s products and the environment .
Indeed , we need a whole new toolbox , something that would be barely recognizable to the geneticists of fifty years ago .
According to the principle that one should simultaneously wage as few battles at possible , the development of the new toolbox for analysis of complex traits wo n’t happen in the most complex organisms .
Instead , we will look to the simplest and most malleable models in which to test our new techniques .
That ’s just what Lorenz et al. have accomplished in a recent study .
Their simple model was yeast , a reliable workhorse in aging research since the dawn of modern biogerontology .
Their toolbox is called “ network inference ” — perturbing the expression of single genes within a network , measuring the resulting changes throughout the transcriptome , and using this data to learn about the connectivity of the network .
A network biology approach to aging in yeast
In this study , a reverse - engineering strategy was used to infer and analyze the structure and function of an aging and glucose repressed gene regulatory network in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
The method uses transcriptional perturbations to model the functional interactions between genes as a system of first - order ordinary differential equations .
The resulting network model correctly identified the known interactions of key regulators in a 10 - gene network from the Snf1 signaling pathway , which is required for expression of glucose - repressed genes upon calorie restriction .
The majority of interactions predicted by the network model were confirmed using promoter - reporter gene fusions in gene - deletion mutants and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments , revealing a more complex network architecture than previously appreciated .
The reverse - engineered network model also predicted an unexpected role for transcriptional regulation of the SNF1 gene by hexose kinase enzyme / transcriptional repressor Hxk2 , Mediator subunit Med8 , and transcriptional repressor Mig1 .
These interactions were validated experimentally and used to design new experiments demonstrating Snf1 and its transcriptional regulators Hxk2 and Mig1 as modulators of chronological lifespan .
This work demonstrates the value of using network inference methods to identify and characterize the regulators of complex phenotypes , such as aging .
It ’s sort of like pulling on one strand of spider silk and watching how other strands move , in order to build a model about the connectedness of the entire web .
Like much modern systems biology , the idea is to study the parts and learn about the whole .
In their first foray , they re-discovered the known interactions in a calorie restriction - regulated gene network in yeast .
Before you yawn : rediscovery of prior knowledge is an important validation for a new technique ; what ’s additionally impressive is that this system , in just a few weeks of experimentation and analysis , was able to recapitulate the results of ( literally ) years of prior work .
Beyond that , the authors were able to detect evidence of novel ( i.e. , heretofore unknown ) interactions between network components .
The critic might argue that this is even duller than the validation attained by re-discovering prior knowledge — but the critic would be wrong .
Whether we ’re talking about schizophrenia , heart disease or aging , we ultimately want to understand complex traits well enough to intervene in them without doing more harm than good .
Approaches like network inference , which reveal the fine detail of biological systems , make it possible to observe the relationships between genes we might target with drugs — as well as predict second - order effects and undesired consequences of specific types of intervention — bringing us that much closer to our goal .
The firm expects 2009 to be " very tough "
US construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar has taken steps to cut around 20,000 jobs , amid falling sales and profits .
It said 5,000 jobs will be reduced in the first quarter , while around 15,000 jobs have already been eliminated .
It employs 112,000 people worldwide , including 10,000 people in the UK .
The majority of the job cuts will be in support and management , but the company is also implementing a shortened working weeks and factory shutdowns .
More details about where the cuts will fall are to be released by the company in the next few weeks .
It is the latest big firm to announce massive job cuts .
On Monday alone , companies worldwide said they planned to eliminate more than 50,000 jobs .
' Very tough year '
GLOBAL JOB CUTS Caterpillar - 20,000 ING - 7,000 Philips - 6,000 Corus - 3,500 Home Depot - 7,000 Pfizer / Wyeth - 20,000 General Motors - 2,000
" Without a doubt , 2009 will be a very tough year , " chief executive Jim Owens said in a statement .
Caterpillar 's fourth - quarter net income fell 32 % from a year ago to $ 661 m ( £ 482 m ) amid higher operating costs and a drop in its financial unit 's profit .
" Fourth - quarter profit was disappointing , particularly in light of record fourth - quarter sales and revenues and a significant favorable tax adjustment , " Mr Owens said .
" We knew Caterpillar was going to be a disaster .
We just did n't know the magnitude of it .
And it 's ugly , " said Eli Lustgarten , an analyst at Longbow Research .
For 2009 , Caterpillar expects sales to be " in a range of plus or minus 10 % of $ 40bn , " significantly lower than its record sales of $ 51.3 bn in 2008 .
Scott McCloud is author of Understanding Comics , a comic book about comics .
He 's an evangelist for comics as a valid literary form ( as more than pulp and kids ' stuff ) and his admiring fans include a laundry list of superstar cartoonists .
Why you should listen
If not for Scott McCloud , graphic novels and webcomics might be enjoying a more modest Renaissance .
The flourishing of cartooning in the '90s and '00s , particularly comic - smithing on the web , can be traced back to his major writings on the comics form .
The first , Understanding Comics , is translated into 13 languages , and along with Reinventing Comics and Making Comics , its playful and profound investigations are justly revered as something like the Poetics of sequential art .
McCloud coined the term " infinite canvas " -- for the new comics medium made possible by web browsers .
He 's an avid user of the medium : My Obsession With Chess was widely popular online , as was The Right Number .
Back on the printed page , he wrote and illustrated Zot ! , a colorful response to then - trendy grimness and gore in comic books .
( He describes the book as " a cross between Peter Pan , Buck Rogers and Marshall McLuhan . " )
He 's the inventor of the game 5 - Card Nancy .
What others say
“ With Scott McCloud ’s ' Understanding Comics ' the dialogue on and about what comics are and , more importantly , what comics can be has begun .
If you read , write , teach or draw comics ; if you want to ; or if you simply want to watch a master explainer at work , you must read this book . ” — Neil Gaiman

Eircom , a major Irish ISP , will now disconnect its users from the Internet if they receive three unsubstantiated copyright infringement claims from the record labels .
The record labels are vowing to hold other ISPs to the same deal , whâ €Žich is part of a court settlement in a lawsuit against Eircom .
The UK has just rejected this measure , and initiatives to spread this across the EU and the US have died as well .
Good thing , too — as I 've written before , this is an insanely dangerous and disproportionate proposal .
After all , you do n't hear the record labels offering to have their Internet connections cut off if they send out three false copyright accusations .
The Internet 's a single wire that delivers freedom of speech , of assembly and of the press — it 's a conduit for civic engagement , health care , employment , education , distant family , love and life .
Disconnecting people from the Internet on the basis of an unsubstantiated accusation , without a court order , without a chance to defend yourself against your accusers , without a chance to see and challenge the evidence — it 's positively medieval .
Shame on Ireland — so much for their high - tech economic miracle .
As part of the settlement , the record companies will supply Eircom with the IP addresses of all persons who they detect illegally uploading or downloading copyright works .
Eircom will then contact the subscribers directly and either warn them or terminate their account .
Willie Kavanagh , chairman of EMI Records , said he was delighted with the outcome and commended Eircom 's far - seeing approach .
During the court case it was claimed music piracy is costing record companies here up to € 14 million a year .
Other ISPs contacted by The Irish Times last night could not confirm if they would implement the system .
A spokeswoman for 3 Ireland , which has 130,000 mobile broadband customers , said it would be " happy to look into the matter " .
Ronan Lupton , chairman of Alto , which represents telecoms operators other than Eircom , said the agreement " is not one enforceable on the rest of the industry given the direct nature of the action against Eircom " .

T ELL me , Muse , of that man , so ready at need , who wandered far and wide , after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy , and many were the men whose towns he saw and whose mind he learnt , yea , and many the woes he suffered in his heart upon the deep , striving to win his own life and the return of his company .
Nay , but even so he saved not his company , though he desired it sore .
For through the blindness of their own hearts they perished , fools , who devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion : but the god took from them their day of returning .
Of these things , goddess , daughter of Zeus , whencesoever thou hast heard thereof , declare thou even unto us .
1
Now all the rest , as many as fled from sheer destruction , were at home , and had escaped both war and sea , but Odysseus only , craving for his wife and for his homeward path , the lady nymph Calypso held , that fair goddess , in her hollow caves , longing to have him for her lord .
But when now the year had come in the courses of the seasons , wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca , not even there was he quit of labours , not even among his own ; but all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon , who raged continually against godlike Odysseus , till be came to his own country .
Howbeit Poseidon had now departed for the distant Ethiopians , the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain , the uttermost of men , abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where he rises .
There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and rams , there he made merry sitting at the feast , but the other gods were gathered in the halls of Olympian Zeus .
Then among them the father of gods and men began to speak , for he bethought him in his heart of noble Aegisthus , whom the son of Agamemnon , far - famed Orestes , slew .
Thinking upon him he spake out among the Immortals : 2
‘ Lo you now , how vainly mortal men do blame the gods !
For of us they say comes evil , whereas they even of themselves through the blindness of their own hearts , have sorrows beyond that which is ordained .
Even as of late Aegisthus , beyond that which was ordained , took to him the wedded wife of the son of Atreus , and killed her lord on his return , and that with sheer doom before his eyes , since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the keen - sighted , the slayer of Argos , that he should neither kill the man , nor woo his wife .
For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at the hand of Orestes , so soon as he shall come to man ’s estate and long for his own country .
So spake Hermes , yet he prevailed not on the heart of Aegisthus , for all his good will ; but now hath he paid one price for all . ’
3
And the goddess , grey - eyed Athene , answered him , saying : ‘ O father , our father Cronides , throned in the highest ; that man assuredly lies in a death that is his due ; so perish likewise all who work such deeds !
But my heart is rent for wise Odysseus , that hapless one , who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction in a seagirt isle , where is the navel of the sea , as woodland isle , and therein a goddess hath her habitation , the daughter of the wizard Atlas , who knows the depths of every sea , and himself upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder .
His daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow : and ever with soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to forgetfulness of Ithaca .
But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but the smoke leap upwards from his own land , hath a desire to die .
As for thee , thine heart regardeth it not at all , Olympian !
What !
did not Odysseus by the ships of the Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in the wide Trojan land ?
Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him , O Zeus ? ’
4
And Zeus the cloud - gatherer answered her , and said , ‘ My child , what word hath escaped the door of thy lips ?
Yea , how should I forget divine Odysseus , who in understanding is beyond mortals and beyond all men hath done sacrifice to the deathless gods , who keep the wide heaven ?
Nay , but it is Poseidon , the girdler of the earth , that hath been wroth continually with quenchless anger for the Cyclops ’ sake whom he blinded of his eye , even godlike Polyphemus whose power is mightiest amongst all the Cyclôpes .
His mother was the nymph Thoösa , daughter of Phorcys , lord of the unharvested sea , and in the hollow caves she lay with Poseidon .
From that day forth Poseidon the earth - shaker doth not indeed slay Odysseus , but driveth him wandering from his own country .
But come , let us here one and all take good counsel as touching his returning , that he may be got home ; so shall Poseidon let go his displeasure , for he will in no wise be able to strive alone against all , in despite of all the deathless gods . ’
5
Then the goddess , grey - eyed Athene , answered him , and said : ‘ O father , our father Cronides , throned in the highest , if indeed this thing is now well pleasing to the blessed gods , that wise Odysseus should return to his own home , let us then speed Hermes the Messenger , the slayer of Argos , to the island of Ogygia .
There with all speed let him declare to the lady of the braided tresses our unerring counsel , even the return of the patient Odysseus , that so he may come to his home .
But as for me I will go to Ithaca that I may rouse his son yet the more , planting might in his heart , to call an assembly of the long - haired Achaeans and speak out to all the wooers who slaughter continually the sheep of his thronging flocks , and his kine with trailing feet and shambling gait .
And I will guide him to Sparta and to sandy Pylos to seek tidings of his dear father ’s return , if peradventure he may hear thereof and that so he may be had in good report among men . ’

She spake and bound beneath her feet her lovely golden sandals that wax not old , and bare her alike over the wet sea and over the limitless land , swift as the breath of the wind .
And she seized her doughty spear , shod with sharp bronze , weighty and huge and strong , wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes with whomsoever she is wroth , the daughter of the mighty sire .
Then from the heights of Olympus she came glancing down , and she stood in the land of Ithaca , at the entry of the gate of Odysseus , on the threshold of the courtyard , holding in her hand the spear of bronze , in the semblance of a stranger , Mentes the captain of the Taphians .
And there she found the lordly wooers : now they were taking their pleasure at draughts in front of the doors , sitting on hides of oxen , which themselves had slain .
And of the henchmen and the ready squires , some were mixing for them wine and water in bowls , and some again were washing the tables with porous sponges and were setting them forth , and others were carving flesh in plenty .
7
And godlike Telemachus was far the first to descry her , for he was sitting with a heavy heart among the wooers dreaming on his good father , if haply he might come somewhence , and make a scattering of the wooers there throughout the palace , and himself get honour and bear rule among his own possessions .
Thinking thereupon , as he sat among wooers , he saw Athene — and he went straight to the outer porch , for he thought it blame in his heart that a stranger should stand long at the gates : and halting nigh her he clasped her right hand and took from her the spear of bronze , and uttered his voice and spake unto her winged words : ‘ Hail , stranger , with us thou shalt be kindly entreated , and thereafter , when thou hast tasted meat , thou shalt tell us that whereof thou hast need . ’
8
Therewith he led the way , and Pallas Athene followed .
And when they were now within the lofty house , he set spear that he bore against a tall pillar , within the polished spear - stand , where stood many spears besides , even those of Odysseus of the hardy heart ; and he led the goddess and seated her on a goodly carven chair , and spread a linen cloth thereunder , and beneath was a footstool for the feet .
For himself he placed an inlaid seat hard by , apart from the company of the wooers , lest the stranger should be disquieted by the noise and should have a loathing for the meal , being come among overweening men , and also that he might ask him about his father that was gone from his home .
9
Then a handmaid bare water for the washing of hands in a goodly golden ewer , and poured it forth over a silver basin to wash withal , and drew to their side a polished table .
And a grave dame bare wheaten bread and set it by them , and laid on the board many dainties , giving freely of such things as she had by her .
And a carver lifted and placed by them platters of divers kinds of flesh , and nigh them he set golden bowls , and a henchman walked to and fro pouring out to them the wine .
Then in came the lordly wooers ; and they sat them down in rows on chairs , and on high seats , and henchmen poured water on their hands , and maidservants piled wheaten bread by them in baskets , and pages crowned the bowls with drink ; and they stretched forth their hands upon the good cheer spread before them .
Now when the wooers had put from them the desire of meat and drink , they minded them of other things , even of the song and dance : for these are the crown of the feast .
And a henchman placed a beauteous lyre in the hands of Phemius , who was minstrel to the wooers despite his will .
Yea and as he touched the lyre he lifted up his voice in sweet songs .
1 10
But Telemachus spake unto grey - eyed Athene , holding his head close to her that those others might not hear : ‘ Dear stranger , wilt thou of a truth be wroth at the word I shall say ?
Yonder men verily care for such things as these , the lyre and song , lightly , as they that devour the livelihood of another without atonement , of that man whose white bones , it may be , lie wasting in the rain upon the mainland , or the billow rolls them in the brine .
Were but these men to see him returned to Ithaca , they all would pray rather for greater speed of foot than for gain of gold and raiment .
But now he hath perished , even so , an evil doom , and for us is no comfort , no , not though any of earthly men should say that he will come again .
Gone is the day of his returning !
But come declare me this , and tell me all plainly :
Who art thou of the sons of men , and whence ?
Where is thy city , where are they that begat thee ?
Say , on what manner of ship didst thou come , and how did sailors bring thee to Ithaca , and who did they avow themselves to be , for in nowise do I deem that thou camest hither by land .
And herein tell me true , that I may know for a surety whether thou art a newcomer , or whether thou art a guest of the house , seeing that many were the strangers that came to our home , for that he too had voyaged much among men . ’
11
Then the goddess , grey - eyed Athene , answered him : ‘ Yea now , I will plainly tell thee all .
I avow me to be Mentes , son of wise Anchialus , and I bear rule among the Taphians , lovers of the oar .
And now am I come to shore , as thou seest , with ship and crew , sailing over the wine - dark sea , unto men of strange speech , even to Temesa , 2 in quest of copper , and my cargo is shining iron .
And there my ship is lying toward the upland , away from the city , in the harbour of Rheithron beneath wooded Neion : and we declare ourselves to be friends one of the other , and of houses friendly , from of old .
Nay , if thou wouldest be assured , go ask the old man , the hero Laertes , who they say no more comes to the city , but far away toward the upland suffers affliction , with an ancient woman for his handmaid , who sets by him meat and drink , whensoever weariness takes hold of his limbs , as he creeps along the knoll of his vineyard plot .
And now am I come ; for verily they said that he , thy father , was among his people ; but lo , the gods withhold him from his way .
For goodly Odysseus hath not yet perished on the earth ; but still , methinks , he lives and is kept on the wide deep in a seagirt isle , and hard men constrain him , wild folk that hold him , it may be , sore against his will .
But now of a truth will I utter my word of prophecy , as the Immortals bring it into my heart and as I deem it will be accomplished , though no soothsayer am I , nor skilled in the signs of birds .
Henceforth indeed for no long while shall he be far from his own dear country , not though bonds of iron bind him ; he will advise him of a way to return , for he is a man of many devices .
But come , declare me this , and tell me all plainly , whether indeed , so tall as thou art , thou art sprung from the loins of Odysseus .
Thy head surely and they beauteous eyes are wondrous like to his , since full many a time have we held converse together ere he embarked for Troy , whither the others , aye the bravest of the Argives , went in hollow ships .
From that day forth neither have I seen Odysseus nor he me . ’
12
Then wise Telemachus answered her , and said : ‘ Yea , sir , now will I plainly tell thee all .
My mother verily saith that I am his ; for myself I know not , for never man yet knew of himself his own descent .
O that I had been the son of some blessed man , whom old age overtook among his own possessions !
But now of him that is the most hapless of mortal men , his son they say that I am , since thou dost question me hereof . ’
13
Then the goddess , grey - eyed Athene , spake unto him , and said : ‘ Surely no nameless lineage have the gods ordained for thee in days to come , since Penelope bore thee so goodly a man .
But come , declare me this , and tell it all plainly .
What feast , nay , what rout is this ?
What hast thou to do therewith ?
Is it a clan drinking , or a wedding feast , for here we have no banquet where each man brings his share ?
In such wise , flown with insolence , do they seem to me to revel wantonly through the house : and well might any man be wroth to see so many deeds of shame , whatso wise man came among them . ’
14
Then wise Telemachus answered her , and said : ‘ Sir , forasmuch as thou questionest me of these things and inquirest thereof , our house was once like to have been rich and honourable , while yet that man was among his people .
But now the gods willed it otherwise , in evil purpose , who have made him pass utterly out of sight as no man ever before .
Truly I would not even for his death make so great sorrow , had he fallen among his fellows in the land of the Trojans , or in the arms of his friends when he had wound up the clew of war .
Then would the whole Achaean host have builded him a barrow , and even for his son would he have won great glory in the after days .
But now the spirits of the storm have swept him away inglorious .
He is gone , lost to sight and hearsay , but for me hath he left anguish and lamentation ; nor henceforth is it for him alone that I mourn and weep , since the gods have wrought for me other sore distress .
For all the noblest that are princes in the isles , in Dulichium and Same and wooded Zacynthus , and as many as lord it in rocky Ithaca , all these woo my mother and waste my house .
But as for her she neither refuseth the hated bridal , nor hath the heart to make an end : so they devour and minish my house , and ere long will they make havoc likewise of myself . ’
15
Then in heavy displeasure spake unto him Pallas Athene : ‘ God help thee !
thou art surely sore in need of Odysseus that is afar , to stretch forth his hands upon the shameless wooers .
If he could but come now and stand at the entering in of the gate , with helmet and shield and lances twain , as mighty a man as when first I marked him in our house drinking and making merry what time he came up out of Ephyra from Ilus son of Mermerus !
For even thither had Odysseus gone on his swift ship to seek a deadly drug , that he might have wherewithal to smear his bronze - shod arrows : but Ilus would in nowise give it to him , for he had in awe the everliving gods .
But my father gave it him , for he bare him wondrous love .
O that Odysseus might in such strength consort with the wooers : so should they all have swift fate and bitter wedlock !
Howbeit these things surely lie on the knees of the gods , whether he shall return or not , and take vengeance in his halls .
But I charge thee to take counsel how thou mayest thrust forth the wooers from the hall .
Come now , mark and take heed unto my words .
On the morrow call the Achaean lords to the assembly , and declare thy saying to all , and take the gods to witness .
As for the wooers bid them scatter them each one to his own , and for thy mother , if her heart is moved to marriage , let her go back to the hall of that mighty man her father , and her kinsfolk will furnish a wedding feast , and array the gifts of wooing exceeding many , all that should go back with a daughter dearly beloved .
And to thyself I will give a word of wise counsel , if perchance thou wilt hearken .
Fit out a ship , the best thou hast , with twenty oarsmen , and go to inquire concerning thy father that is long afar , if perchance any man shall tell thee aught , or if thou mayest hear the voice from Zeus , which chiefly brings tidings to men .
Get thee first to Pylos and inquire of goodly Nestor , and from thence to Sparta to Menelaus of the fair hair , for he came home the last of the mail - coated Achaeans .
If thou shalt hear news of the life and the returning of thy father , then verily thou mayest endure the wasting for yet a year .
But if thou shalt hear that he is dead and gone , return then to thine own dear country and pile his mound , and over it pay burial rites , full many as is due , and give thy mother to a husband .
But when thou hast done this and made an end , thereafter take counsel in thy mind and heart , how thou mayest slay the wooers in thy halls , whether by guile or openly ; for thou shouldst not carry childish thoughts , being no longer of years thereto .
Or hast thou not heard what renown the goodly Orestes gat him among all men in that he slew the slayer of his father , guileful Aegisthus , who killed his famous sire ?
And thou , too , my friend , for I see that thou art very comely and tall , be valiant , that even men unborn may praise thee .
But I will now go down to the swift ship and to my men , who methinks chafe much at tarrying for me ; and do thou thyself take heed and give ear unto my words . ’
16
Then wise Telemachus answered her , saying : ‘ Sir , verily thou speakest these things out of a friendly heart , as a father to his son , and never will I forget them .
But now I pray thee abide here , though eager to be gone , to the end that after thou hast bathed and had all thy heart ’s desire , thou mayest wend to the ship joyful in spirit , with a costly gift and very goodly , to be an heirloom of my giving , such as dear friends give to friends . ’
17
Then the goddess , grey - eyed Athene , answered him : ‘ Hold me now no longer , that am eager for the way .
But whatsoever gift thine heart shall bid thee give me , when I am on my way back let it be mine to carry home : bear from thy stores a gift right goodly , and it shall bring thee the worth thereof in return . ’
18
So spake she and departed , the grey - eyed Athene , and like an eagle of the sea she flew away , but in his spirit she planted might and courage , and put him in mind of his father yet more than heretofore .
And he marked the thing and was amazed , for he deemed that it was a god ; and anon he went among the wooers , a godlike man .
19
Now the renowned minstrel was singing to the wooers , and they sat listening in silence ; and his song was of the pitiful return of the Achaeans , that Pallas Athene laid on them as they came forth from Troy .
And from her upper chamber the daughter of Icarius , wise Penelope , caught the glorious strain , and she went down the high stairs from her chamber , not alone , for two of her handmaids bare her company .
Now when the fair lady had come unto the wooers , she stood by the pillar of the well - builded roof holding up her glistening tire before her face ; and a faithful maiden stood on either side of her .
Then she fell a weeping , and spake unto the divine minstrel : 20
‘ Phemius , since thou knowest many other charms for mortals , deeds of men and gods , which bards rehearse , some one of these do thou sing as thou sittest by them , and let them drink their wine in silence ; but cease from this pitiful strain , that ever wastes my heart within my breast , since to me above all women hath come a sorrow comfortless .
So dear a head do I long for in constant memory , namely , that man whose fame is noised abroad from Hellas to mid Argos . ’
21
Then wise Telemachus answered her , and said : ‘ O my mother , why then dost thou grudge the sweet minstrel to gladden us as his spirit moves him ?
It is not minstrels who are in fault , but Zeus , methinks , is in fault , who gives to men , that live by bread , to each one as he will .
As for him it is no blame if he sings the ill - faring of the Danaans ; for men always prize that song the most , which rings newest in their ears .
But let thy heart and mind endure to listen , for not Odysseus only lost in Troy the day of his returning , but many another likewise perished .
Howbeit go to thy chamber and mind thine own housewiferies , the loom and distaff , and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks .
But speech shall be for men , for all , but for me in chief ; for mine is the lordship in the house . ’
22
Then in amaze she went back to her chamber , for she laid up the wise saying of her son in her heart .
She ascended to her upper chamber with the women her handmaids , and then was bewailing Odysseus , her dear lord , till grey - eyed Athene cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids .
23
Now the wooers clamoured throughout the shadowy halls , and each one uttered a prayer to be her bedfellow .
And wise Telemachus first spake among them : 24
‘ Wooers of my mother , men despiteful out of measure , let us feast now and make merry and let there be no brawling ; for , lo , it is a good thing to list to a minstrel such as him , like to the gods in voice .
But in the morning let us all go to the assembly and sit us down , that I may declare my saying outright , to wit that ye leave these halls : and busy yourselves with other feasts , eating your own substance , going in turn from house to house .
But if ye deem this a likelier and a better thing , that one man ’s goods should perish without atonement , then waste ye as ye will ; and I will call upon the everlasting gods , if haply Zeus may grant that acts of recompense be made : so should ye hereafter perish within the halls without atonement . ’
25
So spake he , and all that heard him bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus , in that he spake boldly .
26
Then Antinous , son of Eupeithes , answered him : ‘ Telemachus , in very truth the gods themselves instruct thee to be proud of speech and boldly to harangue .
Never may Cronion make thee king in seagirt Ithaca , which thing is of inheritance thy right !’
27
Then wise Telemachus answered him , and said : ‘ Antinous , wilt thou indeed be wroth at the word that I shall say ?
Yea , at the hand of Zeus would I be fain to take even this thing upon me .
Sayest thou that this is the worst hap that can befal a man ?
Nay , verily , it is no ill thing to be a king : the house of such an one quickly waxeth rich and himself is held in greater honour .
Howsoever there are many other kings of the Achaeans in seagirt Ithaca , kings young and old ; someone of them shall surely have this kingship since goodly Odysseus is dead .
But as for me , I will be lord of our own house and thralls , that goodly Odysseus gat me with his spear . ’
28
Then Eurymachus , son of Polybus , answered him , saying : ‘ Telemachus , on the knees of the gods it surely lies , what man is to be king over the Achaeans in seagirt Ithaca .
But mayest thou keep thine own possessions and be lord in thine own house !
Never may that man come , who shall wrest from thee thy substance violently in thine own despite while Ithaca yet stands .
But I would ask thee , friend , concerning the stranger — whence he is , and of what land he avows him to be ?
Where are his kin and his native fields ?
Doth he bear some tidings of thy father on his road , or cometh he thus to speed some matter of his own ?
In such wise did he start up , and lo , he was gone , nor tarried he that we should know him ; — and yet he seemed no mean man to look upon . ’
3 29
Then wise Telemachus answered him , and said : ‘ Eurymachus , surely the day of my father ’s returning hath gone by .
Therefore no more do I put faith in tidings , whencesoever they may come , neither have I regard unto any divination , whereof my mother may inquire at the lips of a diviner , when she hath bidden him to the hall .
But as for that man , he is a friend of my house from Taphos , and he avows him to be Mentes , son of wise Anchialus , and he hath lordship among the Taphians , lovers of the oar . ’
30
So spake Telemachus , but in his heart he knew the deathless goddess .
Now the wooers turned them to the dance and the delightsome song , and made merry , and waited till evening should come on .
And as they made merry , dusk evening came upon them .
Then they went each one to his own house to lie down to rest .

The Electronic Frontier Foundation Does n't Like Apple 's Attitude
by Ostatic Staff - Nov. 26 , 2008

Who knows why many open source users are also Macintosh users , but I 've noticed a correlation there for years .
Maybe it 's because open source , like the Mac , rings of rebellion against the status quo .
Nevertheless , if you think the love always flows in two directions , check out this post from the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
According to the EFF , Apple 's lawyers recently put the kibosh on an online discussion of open source software , dubbed iPodhash , which the lawyers perceived as designed to circumvent aspects of Apple 's FairPlay digital rights management ( DRM ) , used in iTunes .
( The original discussion is removed . )
The key word there is " discussion " -- there was no fully realized application that actually cracked Apple 's encryption .
As the Electronic Frontier Foundation points out :
" At the heart of this is the iTunesDB file , the index that the iPod operating system uses to keep track of what playable media is on the device .
Unless an application can write new data to this file , it wo n't be able to ' sync ' music or other content to an iPod .
The iTunesDB file has never been encrypted and is relatively well understood .
In iPods released after September 2007 , however , Apple introduced a checksum hash to make it difficult for applications other than iTunes to write new data to the iTunesDB file , thereby hindering an iPod owner 's ability to use alternative software ( like gtkpod , Winamp , or Songbird ) to manage the files on her iPod . "
Apple 's original checksum hash , an encryption scheme , was cracked within three days of its release .
However , Apple has recently updated the checksum hash for the iPod and iPod Touch , and that piece of code obfuscation has not been hacked yet .
Long story short , a discussion of how to crack Apple 's new checksum hash using open source software called iPodhash took place on a wiki dubbed Bluwiki .
While nobody posted an actual application for cracking it , there was some illustrative code .
You can view the communications that Bluewiki has posted regarding taking the discussions down here .
There , the Digital Mellenium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) is cited as protecting Apple 's FairPlay DRM scheme , because it is considered " anti-circumvention technology . "
Attorneys at the Electronic Frontier Foundation are crying foul .
" If Apple is suggesting that the DMCA reaches people merely talking about technical protection measures , then they 've got a serious First Amendment problem , " they write .
I have to agree .
Talk is talk .
Encryption and other forms of code obfuscation are communally practiced throughout the worlds of proprietary and open source software .
Also , encryption predates personal computers and Apple by many years .
Where would security software end up if people were barred , directed by lawyers , from ever discussing methods of disguising code ?
An Israeli entrepreneur with decades of experience in international education plans to start the first global , tuition - free Internet university , a nonprofit venture he has named the University of the People .
“ The idea is to take social networking and apply it to academia , ” said the entrepreneur , Shai Reshef , founder of several Internet - based educational businesses .
“ The open - source courseware is there , from universities that have put their courses online , available to the public , free , ” Mr. Reshef said .
“ We know that online peer - to - peer teaching works .
Putting it all together , we can make a free university for students all over the world , anyone who speaks English and has an Internet connection . ”
About four million students in the United States took at least one online course in 2007 , according to a survey by the Sloan Consortium , a nonprofit group devoted to integrating online learning into mainstream higher education .
CAIRO ( Reuters ) - Egyptian police have detained an Egyptian - German political activist and blogger on Gaza Strip issues , his sister and an eyewitness said Saturday .
Philip Rizk , 26 , a graduate student at the American University in Cairo , was detained by police Friday night while returning to Cairo from Qalyoubia , north of Cairo , his sister Jeanette told Reuters .
Rizk and a group of activists had been holding a march in the rural areas north of Cairo in solidarity with Palestinians and to raise awareness about the effects of Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories , according to Salma Said , an activist who was with Rizk when he was detained .
A spokesman for the Ministry of Interior said he had received no word of the detention .
Said said police had detained their vehicle for several hours and then said they wanted to talk with Rizk .
They put him in a vehicle with no licence plates and sped off .
Other policemen then blocked the activists ’ vehicle to prevent them from following .
“ We do n’t know where he is , and there is no formal charge , ” Rizk ’s sister said .
She added that the German embassy had been notified and were attempting to locate him .
Rizk , who blogs at Tabula Gaza ( tabulagaza.blogspot.com ) is " passionate " about Gaza and had recently completed most of the work on a short documentary about non-violent resistance to Israeli occupation , according to his sister .
She said that Rizk , who lived in Gaza for two years , had been helping get medicine into the coastal enclave that was recently the target of a 22 - day Israeli offensive that left more than 1,300 Palestinians dead .
The Egyptian government contributes to the blockade of Gaza by refusing to open the Rafah crossing point without Israeli approval .
It seems I managed to stir up the ColdFusion world yesterday on Twitter by responding to a tweet by Peter Elst that read :
free coldfusion technical workshops , shame they 're splitting it into separate Dutch and French sessions in Brussels -- http://is.gd/eLpJ
If you follow the link , you 'll see that it leads to a blog post by Andrew Shorten from Adobe UK announcing that Adobe is offering free technical workshops around Europe to teach developers ColdFusion 8 .
That can't be bad , right ?
I mean free is good , is n't it ?
My response , which kicked off a small wave of conversation was :
@peterelst Surely _they_ should be paying people to take Coldfusion classes ; why waste time learning a dead - end proprietary technology ?
The immediate response of an Adobe CF evangelist was to ask me to refrain from being a " player hater " ( Adobe 's so street these days , yo ) and inform me that " ColdFusion and it's community pioneered the RIA movement " , adding that ColdFusion " is paying for Flex / Catalyst " so I should n't " piss in my own pool " by dissing ColdFusion .
Man , that 's some old - school Spanish Inquisition - style evangelism right there ! :)
Before I move on , a little observation and fact checking on that tweet is in order :
ColdFusion did not pioneer the RIA movement , Flash did .
Any rich - client technology in ColdFusion comes from Flash / Flex , not the other way around .
We were building RIAs with Flash in Flash 5 , before Macromedia acquired Allaire , even though the term had not been coined yet .
That 's not to say that ColdFusion was n't revolutionary when it debuted in 1995 , thirteen years ago .
It greatly simplified the creation of dynamic web sites and was subsequently copied by PHP and ASP .
When I was creating my first web application , a pet project to build an online video catalog for my university 's library , I wrote the back - end in C as a CGI .
Coldfusion would have greatly simplified my task .
Finally , it 's irrelevant whether or not ColdFusion sales are paying for Flex and Flash Catalyst development .
Adobe needs to remain competitive with the Flash Platform and it's internal accounting is its own business .
Coldfusion sales could drop to zero today and Adobe would invest as much if not more in Flash .
The two are not linked in any way .
To get back to the topic at hand : why do I think that young web developers should not waste their time learning ColdFusion ?
Is it dead , dying , or alive and well and living in the enterprise ?
Is it dead ?
It 's no surprise that people have been pronouncing ColdFusion dead for some time now .
ComputerWorld famously included it in its list of The top 10 dead ( or dying ) computer skills .
Dave Lowe makes this point in his blog post from last year :
We know what our ideal server environment is ( XServes + Apache + Python + Django ) and we know there 's a huge difference between what we 're able to do now and what we 'll be able to do in the future with that setup .
But first , a little background .
I 've been working with ColdFusion for 7 + years .
It was the first server - side language I learned , and I 've built many different web applications with it .
I started out as very much a rookie programmer and gradually moved to best practices and started leveraging components for as much as possible .
From there I quickly learned that ColdFusion did n't have much more to offer , and if I were to continue using it , I would be doomed to code redundant line after redundant line .
On top of that , if I wanted any modern libraries that exist in the open - source world , I 'd have to reinvent those wheels myself .
Is it dying ?
It 's a matter of perspective .
I 'm a web developer .
As far as consumer - facing web applications go , ColdFusion has zero mind share .
It is , effectively , dead .
How many new web applications ( not enterprise apps / intranet apps ) do you know that run on ColdFusion ?
It 's not modern , it 's not exciting , and it's not a skill that can be easily transferred .
To state that ColdFusion is dead , however , would be to deny the huge number of legacy ColdFusion apps in enterprises across the globe .
No , it 's not dead .
But it is living out its last days in a comfortable retirement home .
Coldfusion is alive and well and living in the Enterprise
The first time I encountered ColdFusion , about eight years ago , was when I inherited a ColdFusion - based student registration application at a prestigious law school in the US .
It was linked to an MS Access database and would , like clockwork , go down every year on registration day .
Not the best start to a relationship but definitely not unheard of in the ColdFusion world where the promise of non-programmers creating applications creates for good marketing but crappy applications .
However , it is good marketing that sells to enterprises and I 'm not surprised that Adobe is still selling CF to enterprises today .
They 'll probably continue to do so .
More power to 'em .
Enterprise , however , is not the web .
Why you have better things to learn than ColdFusion
If you 're just starting out as a web developer and you 'd like to spend the best years of your career maintaining legacy applications in an enterprise then , by all means , learn ColdFusion .
The simple truth is that in the age of Web 2.0/3.0 , in the era of cloud and utility computing , the application server is a commodity .
A commercial , proprietary app server simply cannot survive in this environment anywhere outside the lethargic , soft - padded walls of the enterprise .
That 's why I feel that it 's a waste of time for a developer to learn ColdFusion today and I do n't see how an impartial party ( i.e. , without short - term financial self - interests ) could , in good faith , advise any young developer differently .
If you want to work on cutting edge Web 2.0/3.0 sites , learn modern development paradigms , deploy applications on the cloud and possibly reach and affect millions if not billions of people , then learn Python or Ruby ( and less so PHP ) , and , of course , JavaScript .
Learn Flex and ActionScript .
Learn Objective -C , AIR , and QT .
More importantly , read up on MVC and understand how frameworks like Django , RoR , and CakePHP work .
Learn about graphic design , user experience design , web standards , and accessibility .
Those are skills that will not only make you a better designer and developer but that you can reapply and reuse , even if the technologies themselves eventually fall out of favor .
But surely you can learn ColdFusion too , especially if the course is free , right ?
Sure you can .
But there 's free and then there 's free .
The opportunity cost of your learning ColdFusion is the time you will be wasting not learning the relevant skills and technologies of our day .
And time , given all that there is to learn and experience out there , is your scarcest resource .
When you factor in the opportunity cost , free starts to look rather costly .
What 's the big deal ?
I 'm very passionate about education , and it saddens me to see , for example , that kids in the UK are being taught a computer education curriculum that is almost entirely focussed on teaching them secretarial skills with Microsoft products .
It 's very important that we give the next generation a modern set of computing skills ; these skills are the new literacy .
I was lucky enough to have had some great mentors at a time when personal computing was still in its infancy and I want to make sure that my children have the same , if not better , opportunities for achieving literacy in the information age .
This is a topic that I will , no doubt , continue to explore in future blog posts and it is an area that I want to get more involved in — at least in the UK — with the aim of actually helping improve the status quo .

Be careful down south , fellas .
Bring home the story and not a disease .
Every day when David Oddsson goes to work , the head of the Central Bank of Iceland must brave a crowd of jeering protesters , angry that the man they view as the chief architect of Iceland 's near - total financial collapse refuses to step down .
This tiny country of 300,000 spent the past decade becoming a financial hub of Europe , loading its banks with so much debt that when they finally collapsed , their inability to pay back account holders in the U.K. led that country 's prime minister , Gordon Brown , to freeze Icelandic assets under a law designed to fight terrorism .
Iceland Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir has said the country still has two valuable natural resources that could help it climb out of the current crisis — fish and renewable energy .
Many believe the country 's fishing stocks may already be overtaxed , however , and the vast swathes of land required to build additional hydropower dams in Iceland make them politically unpopular .
That makes the exploitation of the thousands of megawatts of untapped geothermal power lying just beneath the feet of Iceland 's citizens very appealing .
" When I started in this industry in 1995 , we produced under 50 megawatts of geothermal power , and today it 's 10 times that , " says Ásgeir Margeirsson , CEO of Geysir Green Energy , which is a shareholder in one of the leading geothermal power companies in Iceland .
Domestically , several hundred more megawatts of geothermal power are set to come on line in the next few years and , owing to the excellent balance sheets of Iceland 's power companies , not even the nationalization of its banks , collapse of its currency , and impending indebtedness to the International Monetary Fund can stop it , Margeirsson says .
( Nor has the economic crisis affected the highly experimental Iceland Deep Drilling Project , whose long - term goal is to dramatically increase the efficiency of existing geothermal fields . )
But Iceland 's plan to become the dominant player in global geothermal power production through financing such projects , on the other hand , is as dead as the 50 percent of the country 's livestock that were snuffed out by the eight million tons of sulfur dioxide - and fluorine - laced aerosol released by the volcanic Laki fissure in 1783 .
" With [in ] another two years , we would have been in a position to be the strong player we 've always believed was needed in the market , " says Alexander Richter , a former director in the Global Geothermal Energy Team of Glitnir Bank , which financed geothermal projects in the U.S. , China and elsewhere , and is one of the three banks the Icelandic government recently nationalized .
" The sense in the seafood and energy industries is that [ the financial services built around those two industries ] basically all disappeared overnight .
...
We were in Reno , Nev. , at a geothermal trade show on basically the same day it went down here — it was surreal . "
Karl Gawell , executive director of the U.S. - based Geothermal Energy Association ( GEA ) , notes that before the crisis , Iceland 's small domestic market for energy encouraged its geothermal industry to seek expansion opportunities overseas .
Unfortunately , financing for those projects is difficult to come by because of the dismal global economy .
" In general , there is financing out there for geothermal , but it 's difficult to get and it's expensive , " Gawell says .
" You have to have a really premium project to get even credit card interest rates . "
Unlike the financial side of Iceland 's geothermal power industry , the engineering sector is using the crisis as an opportunity to sell its services internationally .
Despite — and because of — the collapse of its domestic civil engineering business , Mannvit Engineering , Iceland 's largest engineering consultancy and a significant employer of geothermal engineers , is expanding its overseas business as fast as it can .
" When [ the crisis ] happened , our decision to put further efforts into what we 're doing abroad was almost immediate , " says Runolfur Maack , deputy CEO of foreign operations at Mannvit .
" Over the past few months , the increase in our foreign income was at least 50 percent . "
( Despite the increase , international business represents only a tenth of the total income of Mannvit . )
The collapse of the Icelandic krona means that Mannvit 's services are cheaper than ever .
The company hopes to land more geothermal contracts in Chile and even in the U.S. , the latter of which it has never before operated .
" We used to be expensive , but because of the huge devaluation of the krona , we are now more competitive in our prices , " Maack says .
GEA 's Gawell warns that even as Icelandic expertise becomes more competitive , demand for it could be drying up due to global financial distress .
" On the other hand , in the long run I do n't think there 's any question we 're moving into a climate change regime for energy , " Gawell says .
" Countries that rely on fossil fuels will have to invest in new technology and efficiency or will pay higher prices .
I think Iceland will be in very good position in those markets . "
Preparing the next generation of engineers to capitalize on the long - term trends in renewable energy is the one part of the geothermal industry that is booming .
A new master 's program in alternative energy that is a joint effort of Icelandic and foreign universities ( and includes a specialization in the physics of geothermal power ) , has been drawing more attention than ever .
" Up to now Iceland was expensive to visit , much less live in , " says Arnbjörn Ólafsson , director of international affairs at the School for Renewable Energy Science in Akureyri , Iceland .
" We 've had more applications now than ever before .
It basically started in October , which was the week after the collapse in Iceland .
The visits to our Web site , especially from the U.S. , went up 50 percent .
It shows that there 's a lot to the old saying about ' any information is better than no information at all . ' "
Whereas many in Iceland , including its new prime minister , who took power February 1 and who is a Social Democrat , are optimistic that the country 's renewable power surplus can help rebuild its economy , there are significant obstacles that must first be overcome .
The further development of geothermal resources , for instance , is heavily dependent on outside investment , yet the most important source of outside investment to date , new aluminum smelters , has become politically unpopular because of concern about the environment , and economically unsound , as long as the price of aluminum stays low .
Attracting energy - hungry alternatives to smelters , such as data centers and solar silicon plants , are an official priority of Landsvirkjun , Iceland 's national power authority .
Orkustofnun , Iceland 's National Energy Authority has even floated the idea of building undersea cables that could transmit power directly to the European grid .
But so far none of these projects has progressed past position papers and declarations .
" The change the left wing party brings is to prioritize alternatives to the smelters , " Geysir 's Margeirsson says .
" But it is a question of investors coming in and having the courage to invest in these big projects . "
Richter , who resigned from the newly nationalized Glitnir Bank in December , and then immediately launched a Web site that aggregates news about new geothermal projects , is skeptical that new opportunities for Iceland to use its energy will come swiftly .
" The prime minister said we are blessed with two resources that have helped the country for centuries — fish and geothermal , " he says .
" In a sense , that 's a very naive view . "
Iceland must overcome a huge foreign debt that it has already promised to pay off , a collapsed currency that makes imports expensive as well as high inflation combined with high unemployment , Richter notes .
Both Richter and Margeirsson worry that a buyer for Iceland 's electricity may not materialize in the current gloomy economic climate .
What 's more , any buyer looking to invest in the country must be willing to accept Iceland 's commitment to limiting development and keeping the country environmentally friendly .
" You have people like Björk who are critical of current development policies , " Richter says .
" So we have to do this in a more sustainable way .
It ca n't be all just heavy industry — we have to watch out for the environmental issues … .
There 's a big discussion around that .
How do you maintain growth so that the country itself is not selling out ? "

IC 1805 : The Heart Nebula
Credit & Copyright : Daniel Marquardt
Explanation : Sprawling across almost 200 light - years , emission nebula IC 1805 is a mix of glowing interstellar gas and dark dust clouds .
Derived from its Valentine 's - Day - approved shape , its nickname is the Heart Nebula .
About 7,500 light - years away in the Perseus spiral arm of our galaxy , stars were born in IC 1805 .
In fact , near the cosmic heart 's center are the massive hot stars of a newborn star cluster also known as Melotte 15 , about 1.5 million years young .
A little ironically , the Heart Nebula is located in the constellation Cassiopeia .
From Greek mythology , the northern constellation is named for a vain and boastful queen .
This deep view of the region around the Heart Nebula , cropped from a larger mosaic , spans about 2.5 degrees on the sky or about 5 times the diameter of the Full Moon .
As federal authorities press their case against a Tustin man accused of lying about ties to Al - Qaeda , they disclosed this week that some evidence came from an informant who infiltrated Orange County mosques and allegedly recorded the defendant discussing jihad , weapons and plans to blow up abandoned buildings .
On Wednesday , a man who claims to be that informant stepped forward , filing court documents saying that he had served as a confidential informant for the FBI from July 2006 to October 2007 to identify and thwart terrorist operations in the Orange County Islamic community .
The claim by Craig Monteilh , a 46 - year - old Irvine resident , that he had been sent by the FBI to infiltrate several Orange County mosques could affect the government ’s case against Ahmadullah Sais Niazi .
His allegations highlight recurring issues about the use of informants by law enforcement agencies and have fanned long - held fears by some Muslim leaders about religious profiling .
Monteilh said in interviews that he had alerted the FBI to Niazi after meeting him at the Islamic Center of Irvine in November 2006 and spending eight months with him .
Monteilh said he called himself Farouk Al - Aziz and posed as a Syrian - French American in search of his Islamic roots .
Monteilh told the FBI that Niazi befriended him and began to lecture him about jihad , gave him lessons in bomb - making and discussed plots to blow up Orange County landmarks .

“ He took me under his wing and began to radicalize me , ” Monteilh said .
The FBI declined to comment on Monteilh ’s allegations , which could not be independently verified .
Niazi ’s attorney , deputy federal public defender Chase Scolnick , also declined to comment .
But an FBI agent ’s testimony in the case Tuesday and interviews with Muslim leaders both appeared to bolster some of Monteilh ’s assertions about his role in the case .
Special Agent Thomas J. Ropel III testified at a bail hearing for Niazi that the defendant had been secretly recorded by an informant while initiating jihadist rhetoric and threatening to blow up abandoned buildings .
Ropel did not name Monteilh but testified that the agency ’s informant was the same man Muslims had reported to the FBI as an extremist .
In June 2007 , the Council on American - Islamic Relations reported Monteilh to the FBI as a possible terrorist , said Hussam Ayloush , the council ’s executive director in Anaheim .

Ayloush said he was “ 100 % sure ” that Monteilh was the informant in question and expressed anger and disappointment that the FBI would infiltrate mosques .
He accused officials of trying to entrap innocent Muslims , noting that Monteilh has been convicted of grand theft and forgery in the past .
He said Muslims had worked hard to develop a partnership with the FBI -- and had been assured by J. Steven Tidwell , then assistant director in charge of the Los Angeles field office , at an Irvine forum in 2006 that their mosques were not being monitored .
Now , Ayloush said , he has doubts about future relations with the FBI .
“ This is religious profiling at its worst , ” Ayloush said about the FBI operation .
The Afghanistan - born Niazi , 34 , was arrested last week and is scheduled to be arraigned next month on suspicion of perjury , naturalization fraud , misuse of a passport obtained by fraud and making a false statement to a federal agency .
Niazi , who has lived in the United States since 1998 and earned citizenship five years ago , is related by marriage to Amin al - Haq , an Afghan militant who fought the Soviet occupation of the 1980s with a U.S. - backed Islamic resistance force that now is branded an Al Qaeda affiliate .
Niazi is accused of failing to disclose those ties during his application for citizenship .
Niazi asserted after his arrest last week that he is an innocent man who is being retaliated against by the FBI for refusing to become an informant .

In Tuesday ’s bail hearing , Ropel asserted that Niazi was a danger to the community who should be held without bail .
But prosecutors offered no testimony regarding the specific plots Monteilh says he told the FBI that he discussed with Niazi , allegedly involving attacks on Orange County shopping centers , military installations and court buildings .
Nor was there any testimony about other mosque members allegedly having been involved in those or other terrorist activities , as Monteilh maintains was the case .
Ayloush said he had received numerous complaints from Muslims in 2007 that Monteilh was aggressively promoting terrorist plots and trying to recruit others to join him .
Citing such behavior and saying that it made members of the mosque feel threatened , the Islamic Center of Irvine won a temporary restraining order in June 2007 that barred Monteilh from the mosque .
Monteilh filed a petition Wednesday to lift the restraining order , saying that he wanted to clear his name from any suspicion of terrorist activity .
He had not contested the original order , he said , because he had been instructed by the FBI not to testify at the hearing .
But he said he was speaking out now because the FBI had allegedly violated pledges to remove the restraining order , place him in a witness protection program , give him a final payment of $ 100,000 and grant other benefits in an exit package .
“ Although the FBI has not fulfilled their promises , I am proud to have participated in the War on Terror , ” Monteilh said in the petition .

Monteilh , burly and bald , said he first began working for the FBI in late 2003 as an informant on white supremacist and narcotics cases after making connections with the Aryan Brotherhood during a prison stint for forgery .
In 2006 , he alleges , he agreed to infiltrate mosques .
During two weeks of training , Monteilh said in an interview with The Times , he was taught about Islam , Arabic , self - defense and weapons .
He said he was outfitted with video and audio recording devices and given specific names of people to monitor .
Monteilh said he also was instructed to progress slowly in his embrace of Islam to make his conversion seem natural -- wearing Western clothes initially and then eventually growing a beard and donning an Egyptian robe , shawl and head cap .
In August 2006 , Monteilh said , he approached his first target : the Islamic Center of Irvine .
There , he alleges , he made his declaration of the Islamic faith known as shahada and , as instructed by his FBI handlers , posed as a serious student of Islam .
Several Muslims began to embrace him , he told the FBI , and by December he was approached by Niazi .
The pair dined at an Islamic Chinese restaurant in Anaheim and hit it off after Monteilh pledged that he would do everything he could to protect Muslims from harm by infidels .
He described Niazi as highly intelligent , devout , resourceful and scholarly , with a temperate mien overlaying the passion of his cause .

In an interview , Monteilh alleged that he told the FBI that Niazi told him that he had been one of 200 people who greeted Osama Bin Laden in 1996 when he took refuge in Afghanistan after being expelled from Sudan .
Niazi called Bin Laden an “ angel , ” Monteilh said -- an assertion that FBI Agent Ropel repeated this week as information gleaned from the agency ’s informant .
Ropel testified Tuesday that Niazi told the informant that it was his “ duty to engage in violent jihad . ”
Over a year , Monteilh further related in an interview , the FBI paid him sums ranging from $ 2,500 a month to as high as $ 11,200 .
Monteilh said he was cut loose as an informant in fall 2007 because members of the mosque he infiltrated began to suspect that he was working with the FBI .
Kenneth Piernick , a former FBI counter - terrorism official who is a private security consultant in Virginia , said parsing out what ’s true and what ’s not , even from someone deemed to be a reliable informant , can be challenging .

“ You do n’t go talk to choirboys to get information on thugs , ” said Piernick , who retired from the bureau in 2003 .
He said informants can be egotistical , manipulative and dishonest .
Those who are getting paid , he said , have been known to “ exaggerate information , or even invent it ” to keep the money flowing .
Piernick said common reasons for discontinuing an informant include low - quality or unreliable information .
“ In other words , he ’s not worth the effort , ” Piernick said .

Thank goodness for Firefox .
Yes , it 's a great browser .
Yes , it has all sorts of wonderful plugins that let me do everything from debugging my Web applications to checking the weather forecast .
And , the fact that it works across multiple platforms makes it even better .
But , as Web - based applications become an increasingly integral part of my life , I 've grown dependent on Firefox 's ability to remember my passwords .
It might be silly , or even a bit pathetic , but there is no way I can remember all the different passwords I 've created over the years .
This is especially true for sites where I 've changed my password on occasion , either because my current password expired or because I decided to change it .
This also means that when I use a different browser , or even a different computer , I 'm often at a total loss .
Sure , I remember some of my passwords , but there is no easy way for me to keep track of all of them without writing them down somewhere .
So , I do the digital equivalent — storing them in my browser — and make sure I have my laptop with me wherever I go .
Juggling multiple passwords is n't new , of course .
Even before the growth of Web applications , people were logging in to different computers , networks , e-mail accounts , database systems and so on .
A number of companies made quite a bit of money from “ single sign - on ” , offering back - end solutions that allowed people to log in to a single computer , providing them with access to many different ones .
But , although the problem might not be new , its scale is unprecedented .
We no longer are worried about several hundreds or thousands of individuals keeping track of a dozen passwords , with access to an IT support department .
Rather , we now have to worry about many millions of people , each of whom has dozens of passwords and little or no technical support for any of them .
Moreover , each
Web site has its own particular needs , not to mention its own unique user interface .
And , to top it off , the world is quite different from a corporation ; you can't impose a standard solution from above .
Rather , there must be a way to introduce competition into the equation , such that individuals can choose their own single sign - on provider .
Over the years , a number of companies have tried to enter this space for Internet applications .
Perhaps the most famous ( or infamous ) was Microsoft 's .
NET Passport ( now known as Windows Live ID ) , which was launched with great fanfare — and quickly attracted a great deal of negative attention related to privacy concerns .
Even if Microsoft 's product was technically excellent ( and I 'm not knowledgeable enough to judge it ) , people did not want to be told with whom they must entrust private and sensitive data .
An increasingly popular solution to this problem is OpenID .
OpenID is not necessarily a new technology ; it has existed in some form or another for several years already .
However , it rapidly is picking up steam — so much that right before I wrote these words in February 2008 , we saw Microsoft , Google , IBM , VeriSign and Yahoo embrace OpenID .
Now , it 's true that the number of sites supporting OpenID is currently small — numbering about 8,000 at the time of this writing .
However , the number is growing rapidly , and I expect the pace will pick up as the aforementioned Internet giants begin to get involved .
What if you 're smaller than Google or Microsoft ?
Is OpenID worth adding to your site ?
Is it relatively easy ?
The answer to both questions , I 'm happy to say , is yes .
This month , I discuss the user side of OpenID — how you register for an OpenID and how you manage it .
I also explain how the OpenID specification takes into account the fact that you might eventually need to change providers .
The Basics of OpenID
The term OpenID refers both to a person 's unique identifier and to the standard describing all the technology around that identifier .
To create an OpenID , you must register with an OpenID provider .
Once you have registered your OpenID , it is the provider that authenticates you for every OpenID - enabled application you use .
In other words , the OpenID provider is responsible for checking your identity , which normally means confirming that the user name and password you enter are acceptable .
Thus , logging in to a site with OpenID means the following happens :
You tell the Web application you want to log in with the OpenID protocol .
You enter your OpenID ( more detail on this shortly ) into the application 's login screen .
The application sends you to the login screen for your OpenID provider .
If the provider accepts your credentials ( normally , your user name and password ) , it asks you to confirm that your identity may be exported to the Web application , and if it may do so in the future as well .
Obviously , if you indicate you are willing to share your identity with this Web application in the future , you will skip this step in the future .
Once allowed to export your identity to the Web application , you are returned to the original application you wanted to use , logged in and ready to use it .
Notice there are a few important differences here between OpenID and a “ standard ” login system .
First , users authenticate against a different site from the one they are trying to use .
This is similar to making a purchase via Google Checkout or PayPal , both of which require that users authenticate themselves and authorize the purchase amount on their own sites , rather than on the site belonging to the on - line store .
Some critics of OpenID say that users may be surprised or confused by the switch from one site to another , but I think Google Checkout and PayPal have demonstrated that a reasonable number of people are not put off by switching back and forth .
Moreover , I have read that Firefox 3 will include some integrated OpenID support , which might remove some of the need to switch sites — or at least make it appear more integrated .
However , I 've been using the beta of Firefox 3 for several months and have yet to experience such integration .
And , although I use the term Web application , there is no requirement that OpenID be used only for Web - based applications .
I expect that as OpenID takes hold , a large number of Internet - based applications , obviously including those that run on the Web , will use OpenID .
However , there 's no reason why non-Web applications and services could n't use OpenID as well .
I even can imagine a day when you might use OpenID to enter your house or confirm your identity to your burglar - alarm company .
In the world of OpenID , end - user applications are known as consumers , just as the OpenID authentication systems are known as providers .
Most OpenID providers authenticate users with a user name and password .
Over time , we can expect them to go in other directions as well — for example , using biometric authentication systems .
And , although OpenID providers currently offer their services for free , it 's not hard to imagine a time in which some companies will charge for OpenID services , while others will support themselves via advertising .
Because users can switch OpenID providers at any time , and because users have a choice as to which one they will use , we can expect both competition and ingenuity to be the rule .
One company , Vidoop , has a particularly interesting authentication mechanism , in which users select a pattern of images as their “ password ” .
Each time a user wants to authenticate , a set of images — including those that the user has selected — appears on a 3x3 grid , with each image in a randomly selected location and a random letter placed next to it .
This effectively creates a one - time password , which users enter by typing the letters associated with the ordered set of images they originally chose .
Finally , I should note that you can create and use as many OpenIDs as you like , just as you would normally create as many user names as you like on a Web site .
Some people do this to separate their work ID from their personal ID , or just because they prefer not to put all of their eggs in one authentication basket .
Regardless , OpenID allows you to do this — although it is ironic that a single sign - on solution would spur people to create multiple identities .
Creating and Using an OpenID With all the background information out of the way , let 's create and use an OpenID .
An OpenID is nothing more than a URL , typically written as http://USERNAME.PROVIDER.com.
For example , my OpenID is http://reuvenmlerner.myopenid.com.
Notice that I can share this URL publicly ; there is no reason for me to keep it secret .
MyOpenID.com is just one of several OpenID providers .
Indeed , many people already have an OpenID , even if they do n't realize it .
For example , if you have a blog at LiveJournal , that URL can be used as your OpenID .
To sign up for an OpenID , simply go to the home page of your provider .
For example , go to the MyOpenID.com home page and click on “ sign up for an OpenID ” .
That takes you to https://www.myopenid.com/signup, which asks you to enter a user name ( it must be unique ) and a password .
You also can provide an e-mail address , which is optional , but doing so allows you to recover your password if you ever forget it .
Finally , MyOpenID.com uses a captcha to ensure that a person , rather than a program , is signing up for the account .
Once you have signed up for an OpenID , you can use it to log in to a Web site that supports it .
Typically , logging in to a Web site requires that you enter both a user name and password .
But , if you use OpenID , you enter in neither of these to the Web application 's login screen .
Instead , you enter only the URL of your OpenID , including the http prefix that we so often ignore nowadays .
For example , I can go to www.wikihow.com, a site that lets anyone create a how - to manual .
I click on “ create an account or log in ” at the top of the page , which brings me to a login screen .
The resulting screen tells me I can log in using OpenID , if I want , by going to www.wikihow.com/Special:OpenIDLogin.
( In other words , wikiHow has two separate login pages : one for regular users with a user name / password combination and another for OpenID users , who enter only their OpenID URL . )
Finally , I enter http://reuvenmlerner.myopenid.com into the text field .
Because I had logged in to OpenID earlier , I was n't asked to provide my password .
However , this is the first time I 've tried to log in to wikiHow with OpenID .
Thus , MyOpenID.com must verify that I am willing to share information with wikiHow .
I click on the allow forever button , which means whenever I 'm logged in to MyOpenID.com , it should share information with wikiHow .
After clicking this button , I am redirected back to www.wikihow.com, where I am logged in and identified by my first name .
Switching Providers
This system works quite well in my experience , and you quickly become used to the back and forth authentication process .
However , major problems remain .
What happens if MyOpenID.com goes out of business ?
What if its database is compromised ?
What if it turns out to be highly unethical and is using people 's IDs ?
What if I find a provider whose Web site is more attractive to me ?
I always can switch to a different provider , of course .
But , that effectively means having a new and different user name on a site .
On a social - networking site , this obviously would be disastrous , as I would need to reconnect from my new account to each of the people in my old account .
The solution to this is quite clever .
Instead of giving people the OpenID I mentioned above , I instead give them an OpenID on a Web site that I control , whose URL is unlikely ever to change .
For example , I can give an OpenID of http://reuven.lerner.co.il.
I know that the lerner .
co.il domain will remain mine forever .
Thus , I can be reasonably sure that this URL also will be in my possession for a long time .
Moreover , I control the contents of the home page .
That page may contain any HTML content I want .
But , it also should contain the following two < link > tags in the < head > section : < link rel= " openid.server " href = " http://www.myopenid.com/server " /> < link rel=" openid.delegate " href = " http://reuvenmlerner.myopenid.com/ " />
We already saw how I can log in to wikiHow by giving my OpenID at MyOpenID.com .
But , with the above lines in place , I also can log in to wikiHow by entering http://reuven.lerner.co.il.
This tells wikiHow to retrieve the home page from my personal Web site .
It uses the first < link > tag to know which server to use and the second < link > tag to know which user name and ID to authenticate .
Everything then continues as usual .
I authenticate myself as necessary against MyOpenID.com , which then redirects me back to wikiHow .
The beauty of this redirection system is that if I decide against using MyOpenID for any reason in the future , I simply change the < link > tags in index.html .
wikiHow and all other sites will follow whatever reuven.
lerner .co.il points to , whether it's MyOpenID.com , Vidoop.com or something else .
In this way , I ensure that my OpenID always is associated with the provider who offers me the best combination of security and usability for my purposes .
Unfortunately , things do n't always go smoothly .
For example , when I registered with wikiHow , it got my nickname ( Reuven ) from MyOpenID.com .
When I try to log in with my new , redirected OpenID , wikiHow thinks it 's dealing with a new user — one whose requested nickname clashes with that of an existing user .
So , the key is to set up and use the redirecting URL early on , and not switch to it after you already have used OpenID for some time .
There are other problems as well .
For example , I currently juggle two different sets of identities on - line , as some companies want to deal only with US citizens living in the United States .
And , although I 'm currently back home in Modi'in , Israel , I continue to have a US phone number ( through Skype ) , a mailing address ( at my parents ' house ) , and a US bank account and credit card .
So , I need two separate identities : one with my Israeli information and another with my US information .
Fortunately , OpenID 2.0 supports both the export of information to the consumer application and also the use of multiple personas .
Each persona can have a separate name , nickname , image and location , and I can choose which persona is associated with each consumer , under the umbrella of the same OpenID .
Conclusion OpenID is an increasingly important standard that seems poised to have a central role in future Web and Internet - connected applications .
Using OpenID is not terribly complicated for end users , and it supposedly is going to be integrated into Firefox in the near future .
Next month , we will look at OpenID from the perspective of a Web site that requires users to register .
How can you , as a Web developer , support OpenID on your site ?
We will see that with a bit of work , and some support from open - source libraries , we can support OpenID in our Web applications .
A little nugget from an article in yesterday ’s New York Daily News pointed out by TPM Reader DS .
Turns out my main man Sean Hannity was a big pal of Sir Allen Stanford too …
A big booster of Stanford has been Fox News host Sean Hannity who intones on his radio show , “ Stanford Coins & Bullion , a member of the Stanford Financial Group – their name as good as gold . ”
Less than a month after signing an executive order to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp , President Barack Obama has quietly agreed to keep denying the right to trial to hundreds more terror suspects held at a makeshift camp in Afghanistan that human rights lawyers have dubbed “ Obama ’s Guantanamo ” .
In a single - sentence answer filed with a Washington court , the administration dashed hopes that it would immediately rip up Bush - era policies that have kept more than 600 prisoners in legal limbo and in rudimentary conditions at the Bagram air base , north of Kabul .
Now , human rights groups say they are becoming increasingly concerned that the use of extra-judicial methods in Afghanistan could be extended rather than curtailed under the new US administration .
The air base is about to undergo a $ 60 m ( £ 42 m ) expansion that will double its size , meaning it can house five times as many prisoners as remain at Guantanamo .

Apart from staff at the International Red Cross , human rights groups and journalists have been barred from Bagram , where former prisoners say they were tortured by being shackled to the ceiling of isolation cells and deprived of sleep .
The base became notorious when two Afghan inmates died after the use of such techniques in 2002 , and although treatment and conditions have been improved since then , the Red Cross issued a formal complaint to the US government in 2007 about harsh treatment of some prisoners held in isolation for months .
While the majority of the estimated 600 prisoners are believed to be Afghan , an unknown number – perhaps several dozen – have been picked up from other countries .
One of the detainees who passed through the Afghan prison was Binyam Mohamed , the British resident who is expected to return to the UK this week after his release from Guantanamo Bay .
Mr Mohamed ’s lawyer , Clive Stafford Smith , head of a legal charity called Reprieve , called President Obama ’s strategy “ the Bagram bait and switch ” , where the administration was trumpeting the closure of a camp housing 242 prisoners , while scaling up the Bagram base to house 1,100 more .
“ Guantanamo Bay was a diversionary tactic in the ‘ War on Terror ’ , ” said the lawyer .
“ Totting up the prisoners around the world – held by the US in Iraq , Afghanistan , Djibouti , the prison ships and Diego Garcia , or held by US proxies in Jordan , Egypt and Morocco – the numbers dwarf Guantanamo .
There are still perhaps as many as 18,000 people in legal black holes .
Mr Obama should perhaps be offered more than a month to get the American house in order .
However , this early sally from the administration underlines another message : it is far too early for human rights advocates to stand on the USS Abraham Lincoln and announce , ‘ Mission Accomplished ’ . ”
Four non-Afghan detainees at Bagram are fighting a legal case in Washington to be given the same access to the US court system that was granted to the inmates of Guantanamo Bay by a controversial Supreme Court decision last year .
The Bush administration was fighting their claim .
Two days into his presidency , Mr Obama promised to shut Guantanamo within a year in an effort to restore America ’s moral standing in the world and to prosecute the struggle against terrorism “ in a manner that is consistent with our values and our ideals ” .
But on the same day , the judge in the Bagram case said that the order “ indicated significant changes to the government ’s approach to the detention , and review of detention , of individuals currently held at Guantanamo Bay ” and that “ a different approach could impact the court ’s analysis of certain issues central to the resolution ” of the Bagram cases as well .
Judge John Bates asked the new administration if it wanted to “ refine ” its stance .

The response , filed by the Department of Justice late on Friday , came as a crushing blow to human rights campaigners .
“ Having considered the matter , the government adheres to its previously articulated position , ” it said .
Tina Foster , executive director of the International Justice Network , the New York human rights organisation representing the detainees , warned last night that “ by leaving Bagram open , the administration turns the closure of Guantanamo into essentially a hollow and symbolic gesture ” .
She said : “ Without reconsidering the underlying policy , which has led to the abuses at Abu Ghraib and the indefinite detention of hundreds of people all these years , then we are simply returning to the status quo .
The exact same thing that had the world up in arms has been going on at Bagram since even before Guantanamo .
“ People have been tortured to the point that they have died ; it is a rallying cry for those who oppose the US actions in Afghanistan ; it is not strategic for the US ; and , more importantly , holding people indefinitely , regardless of who they are and regardless of the facts , is completely inconsistent with everything we stand for as a country . ”
The Department of Justice would only say that the legal briefs in the Washington case “ speak for themselves ” .
It says Bagram is a special case because , unlike Guantanamo , it is sited within a theatre of war .
Mr Obama has pushed out the wider questions about the US policy on detaining terror suspects and supporters of the Taliban in Afghanistan until the summer , ordering a review that will take six months to complete .
The administration is weighing the likely increase in prisoners from an expanded fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan , against the international perception that it is embedding extra-judicial detention into its policies for years to come .
The musings of an American writer transplanted in Berlin , Germany .
When Lord Derby asked Sir Lewis Namier , the great historian of Georgian England , why he , as a Jew , did n't write Jewish history , Namier replied : " There is no modern Jewish history , only a Jewish martyrology , and that is not amusing enough for me . "
It might be said that the underlying purpose of the Zionist project – which Namier passionately supported – was to reject Jewish martyrology , and to turn the Jews from passive victims to active makers of their destiny .
That has been accomplished to a fault , many would say as they watch the news from Gaza , where one image after another has caused deep revulsion .
But then that rejection of martyrdom and victimhood may also explain what has puzzled as well as dismayed onlookers – the fact that Israel seems to be quite oblivious to international opinion .
In Muslim countries there is , of course , intense hostility to Israel , which , in return , has long since followed the Latin principle oderint dum metuant towards her neighbours :
Let them hate us , so long as they fear us .
Since there 's no point in even trying to win their hearts and minds , they should be taught to respect brute force , a precept which , it should be admitted , has enjoyed considerable practical success .

The West is different , and European sentiment can be changed by events , as indeed it has been .
Israel and Zionism were once very popular causes in Europe , not least on the liberal left , until the 1967 Six Day War and after .
Since then , European sympathy has steadily ebbed away as Israel attacked Lebanon in 1982 , and again in 2006 , with the suppression of the intifadas between .
And yet Israel shrugs off all strictures and rebukes .
No criticism from relief agencies or the Red Cross makes any difference .
Even more strikingly , Israel has ignored the Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire .
One reason for this is that the only Western country that really counts is the United States , and Israel has for many years been able to rely on unconditional American support .
Having threated to veto previous draft resolutions , the US took part in drafting the security council resolution calling for a ceasefire , and was evidently going to vote for it .
Then late on Thursday the American representative shocked other council members by abstaining .
This volte face came on direct orders from the White House , after president Bush had spoken to Ehud Olmert , the Israeli prime minister , and the Israelis have taken abstention as permission to continue their action .
" Israel is not going to show restraint , " Tzipi Livni , the Israeli Foreign Minister , told The Washington Post yesterday , understandably enough in the circumstances .
Although Israel is sometimes described as an American client state , which receives huge financial subsidy from Washington , she is unique as a client state : she can do exactly as she likes in the knowledge that she will never be seriously restrained by her sponsor .
Even when the White House is privately irritated by Israeli actions , Congress is absolutely reliable , never knowingly outbid in its unswerving loyalty .
During the bombardment of Lebanon in the summer of 2006 , the House of Representatives passed a resolution of total solidarity with Israel by 410 votes to eight , and the Senate has just passed another on a hand vote , not even bothering to take a formal tally .
Anyone who thought that there would be a change of heart and direction after the last American election has n't been concentrating .
The Senate in question is the newly elected , strongly Democratic one , which has just met for the first time .
During the presidential campaign Barack Obama went out of his way to endorse Israel .
He has appointed in the form of Hillary Clinton perhaps the strongest supporter of Israel ever to serve as Secretary of State , not excluding Henry Kissinger , a Jewish refugee from Hitler , though even she is surpassed in her commitment by Rahm Emanuel , Obama 's chief of staff .
But there is more to it , and Israeli intransigence or indifference to outside opinion goes back before the birth of the state .
As it happens , Emanuel has something in common with Ehud Olmert and Tzipi Livni : their fathers all served in the Irgun .
This was the intransigent Zionist militia – described as terrorists by Isaiah Berlin among others , and as fascists by Albert Einstein among others – which waged a campaign of violence against the British , and the Palestinian Arabs , in the last years of the British Mandate in 1946 - 48 .
Its exploits included the bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem , with great loss of life , the hanging of two captured British sergeants in reprisal , and the massacre of villagers at Deir Yassin .
Behind that brutality lay something else .
Men take revenge for small wrongs , Machiavelli said , unable to avenge the larger , and the Irgun was avenging an incomparably and unimaginably greater crime just suffered by the European Jews .
The Jews had tried to be nice to the goyim , Zionism said in effect , and see where it had got them .
A Jewish state would now be created and guarded with all necessary force , indifferent to what the outside world thought .
If need be , Israel will borrow the old chant of the Millwall fans , " No one likes us , we do n't care " – and no more Jewish martyrology .
Not that Namier was the only Zionist to use " Jewish " in a derisive sense .
When someone mentioned Trotsky 's phrase " No war , no peace " , David Ben-Gurion said that it was " some stupid Jewish idea " , and there is a well - known Israeli story about Moshe Dayan , the military hero of the Six Day War .
When he taught at the Israeli staff college , Dayan used to expound a problem , ending with the words , " And I want no Jewish solutions here . "
He meant that , on the sand table or the field , he expected his battles to be won by dash and ferocity , rather than than by the traditional Jewish virtues of subtlety and patience .
Zionist toughness has worked for a long time , but it could be that Israel will one day discover that there 's something to be said for Jewish solutions .

A computer reconstruction of one second of sound as seen by the vOICe system
Blind since birth , Ms Thomas is able to recognize the walls and doors of her house , discern whether the lights are on or off and even distinguish a CD from a floppy disk after only a week using a revolutionary new system .
She is " seeing with sound " .
Developed by Dr Peter Meijer , a senior scientist at Philips Research Laboratories in the Netherlands , the system is called The vOICe ( the three middle letters standing for " Oh I See " ) .
It works by translating images from a camera on - the - fly into highly complex soundscapes , which are then transmitted to the user over headphones .
Watch the ' spikes '
A wearable setup consists of a head - mounted camera , stereo headphones and a notebook PC .
In total it costs about $ 2,500 .
The software is available as a free download .
A blind user wearing The vOICe goes in search of her lost rubbish bin
He hopes that blind users will ultimately learn to mentally reconstruct the visual content of the live camera views , as carried by the soundscapes , so that they experience something akin to meaningful vision .
" Our assumption here is that the brain is ultimately not interested in the information ' carrier ' ( here sound ) but only in the information ' content ' , " says Meijer .
" After all , the signals in the optic nerve of a normally sighted person are also ' just ' neural spiking patterns .
What you think you ' see ' is what your brain makes of all those firing patterns . "
Easy ' tongue '
Enabling users to get an audio snapshot of what is visually in front of them , The vOICe is taking a very different route from " bionic eyes " - retinal and brain implants .
It is non-invasive , offering a higher image resolution ( up to several thousand pixels ) and does not necessarily rely on the visual cortex .
The system 's developer hopes ability will come with practice
Right now brighter areas sound louder , height is indicated by pitch and a built - in colour identifier speaks out colour names when activated .
While it can't track fast cars or read small print efficiently , it does allow blind users to trace out buildings , read a graph and even watch television .
Comparing it in terms of difficulty to learning a foreign language , Meijer hopes that in the long run , users will become more " fluent " in the mental translation so that it becomes more like natural perception , without conscious effort .
Mobile vision
Kevin O'Regan , of the CNRS ( National Centre for Scientific Research ) in Paris , France , and an expert in the area of sensory consciousness , is currently evaluating The vOICe .
This headset connects to a mobile PC
" The problem is that vision is a very high bandwidth system , and it's not clear whether we can achieve sufficient bandwidth via other modalities , " he stated .
To suit user preferences , Blue Edge Bulgaria has developed a simplified but highly portable mobile phone version of The vOICe for the Nokia 3650 camera phone .
It is available as a free download at The vOICe site .
