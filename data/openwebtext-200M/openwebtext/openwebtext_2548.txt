Since 1972 , scientists have known there are four basic circuit components , but if you 've spent any time in an electrical engineering classroom , you probably only have experience with three : capacitor , inductor , and resistor .
The fourth basic component , the memristor , had remained stuck in the domain of theory - - a nice idea that even the theorists thought had few practical uses .
Last year , scientists at Hewlett - Packard ( HP ) demonstrated the first functional solid - state memristor , made from thin films of TiO 2 , and discovered it had an abundance of unique and highly promising properties .
A study released Monday by The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that these same TiO 2 memristors can be fabricated into functional and reprogrammable integrated circuits .
Scientists at HP combined a crossbar architecture of memristors with field effect transistors ( FETs ) to produce a convincing proof - of - concept device that includes circuits that can dynamically reprogram themselves , acting a bit like a solid - state nerve cell - like operation - - a holy grail of electrical engineering .
The theoretical understanding of a memristor predicted that the current moving through a memristor would be proportional to the flux of magnetic field that had flowed through the material .
This caused scientists to look for memristor behavior in magnetic materials , but it turned out they were looking in all the wrong places .
HP found resistance in TiO 2 thin - film multilayers could be controlled by varying an applied voltage and , critically , that the resistance change was non-volatile -- the hallmark of a memristor .
The key to this behavior is creating alternating layers of high - quality ( high resistance ) and defect - rich ( low resitance ) TiO 2 thin films .
Charge transport in TiO 2 is dominated by O2 - conduction , instead of the electrons of most semiconductor devices .
Applying a voltage between the layers causes the O2 - defects to diffuse into the low defect region , reducing the device 's overall resistance .
By applying a reverse bias , the vacancies diffuse back into the defective layer and the resistance returns to its original state .
A functional memristristor must also behave electrically as a single component , so the TiO 2 layer thickness must be restricted below two nanometers , which prevents separate conduction through the individual layers .
To make the new device , n- type FETs were patterned onto a silicon wafer using normal CMOS processing techniques and covered with a protective oxide layer .
A UV nanoimprint process was used to create a two - dimensional grid pattern memristor wires in and their fanout connections to the FETs .
Details of this process are scarce , most likely to protect HP 's intellectual property .
Finally , electrical connections between the fanouts and FETs were made by photolithography ( to spatially locate the vias ) and aluminum metal deposition .
The yield was 20 % for functional and addressable memristor devices ; this was limited by broken nanowires and leads between the memristors and FETs .
However , more than 90 % of the addressable devices were successfully tested , and the devices showed stable operation between - 3 and 4 volts applied bias .
And those devices worked as promised : the high - voltage conductivity was over 10,000 times greater than the zero-bias conductivity .
To demonstrate that they worked in a programmable logic array , the memristor grid was programmed to perform a Boolean sum - of - product operation .
The resistance of each memristor junction was mapped using a probe station and a logic circuit was designed based on these measurements .
ON memristors were programmed by applying a 4.5 V bias using the contacting nanowires , while OFF memristors were programmed with a 2.2 V bias , and logic operations were performed between 0 and 1 V to prevent accidental de-programming of the circuits .
The circuits successfully performed the sum - of - product operation at 2.8 kHz .
The full potential of memristors was demonstrated when the devices were made to actively re-program themselves .
Dynamic reprogramming was achieved by linking the output of the sum - of - products circuit described above to another memristor inside the device .
Instead of simply returning a value of 1 or 0 ( voltages of 0.3V or 1.45 V , respectively ) the voltage was applied to another memristor in the system .
This voltage reprogrammed the target memristor to the ON position .
In this way , calculations carried out in the device can reprogram circuits in other areas , effectively allowing the device to reprogram itself and adapt to different situations .
While the memristor logic circuit may not have become self aware or searched out Sarah Connor , the result was extremely impressive , and it opens doors to exciting new systems .
Despite the wow factor , you can certainly expect to wait some time before buying your own personal memristor device .
Obviously , the yield is far too low for commercialization , and operating at 2.8 khz will not exactly set the word on fire -- it 's not at all clear whether the O2 - conduction mechanism is scalable to faster operation .
Still , the possibilities for operational logic circuits that can reprogram themselves are unending .
These possibilities will most likely drive substantial innovation , particularly because most of the problems lie in the fabrication and are n't the result of an inherent physical limitations .

Polygamy UK : This special Mail investigation reveals how thousands of men are milking the benefits system to support several wives
He cut a smart figure in his grey suit and crisply ironed shirt .
The 6ft tall Somalian bowed to the judge , calling him ' Sir ' , before begging for his wife , Fatima , and their teenage son to be allowed to stay in Britain .
Fatima , with a black khimar veil covering her hair and shoulders , sat quietly next to her husband .
In her late 30s and wearing open sandals , she lowered her dark eyes as the details of the unconventional life she and her husband , Abdi , led in the West London suburb of Shepherd 's Bush unfolded at a busy immigration court .
Multiple marriages in Britain were first declared illegal in 1604
The judge listened in silence .
Perhaps he knew from past experience what was coming next .
Abdi went on to reveal that Fatima was not his only wife .
Indeed , he was a self - confessed bigamist who had a second , much younger wife and a 13 - year - old daughter by her .
They both lived nearby .
' I visit them regularly , ' said Abdi , 51 , who arrived in Britain in the 1990s and works in an old people 's home .
' I have done nothing wrong .
In Somalia , it is normal to have two wives - even three or four .
Fatima is still my wife and she should not be deported . '
He was unable to produce wedding certificates or valid official documents to prove where , or when , he had married both women , therefore raising questions over the validity of the unions , under either Somali or British law .
Yet his story , unravelling at an ordinary weekday hearing at Taylor House , an asylum appeals ' centre in North London , is just one example of the growing phenomenon of multiple marriage in Britain .
Officially , such unions are punishable by up to seven years in prison .
They were first declared illegal in England and Wales in 1604 , when the Parliament of James I took action to restrain ' evil persons ' marrying more than one wife .
Parliament ruled that anyone found guilty of the crime would be sentenced to death .
In the four centuries since , bigamy ( having two wives ) and polygamy ( more than two ) has been frowned on by the state , the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church .
Yet it is clear that officialdom is turning a blind eye to such marriages .
A recent review by four Government departments - the Treasury , the Work and Pensions Department , the Inland Revenue and the Home Office - has concluded that 1,000 men in the United Kingdom are now polygamists , although some say the figure is higher .
Baroness Warsi has warned that politicians have failed to tackle the problem of polygamy because of ' cultural sensitivity '
What is more , the review found , a Muslim man can claim state support of more than £ 10,000 a year to keep his wives , if the wedding took place in one of those countries where polygamy is commonplace , such as Bangladesh , Pakistan , India , Saudi Arabia and across huge tracts of Africa .
For example , a man can receive &£ 92.80 a week in income support for wife number one , and a further £ 33.65 p for each of his subsequent spouses .
Therefore , if he has four wives - the maximum permitted under Islamic teachings - he can claim nearly £ 800 a month from the British taxpayer .
Controversially , a polygamist is also entitled to more generous housing benefits and bigger council houses to reflect the large size of his family .
He is also able to claim £ 1,000 a year in child benefit for each of his growing brood .
The Government insists that polygamy has declined in Britain since the 1988 Immigration Act , which made it harder for men to bring second , third or fourth wives to the UK .
However , it 's little wonder that critics claim our generosity simply encourages more Muslim men to keep several spouses .
Supporters of polygamy claim the Koran states unequivocally that a Muslim man can marry up to four women so long as he treats them equally .
But the Taxpayers '
Alliance , a lobby group , has complained : ' Polygamy is not officially condoned here , so why should British taxpayers have to pay for extra benefits for men to have two , three or four wives ? '
Last week , Baroness Warsi , a Tory spokesperson for community cohesion who is British - born of Pakistani parents , waded into the argument , warning that politicians have failed to tackle the problem of polygamy because of ' cultural sensitivity ' .
The respected Muslim peer told the BBC : ' We 've just avoided either discussing or dealing with the matter head on . '
Baroness Warsi , a Muslim herself , urged the Government to bring in laws demanding the official registration of ' Nikah ' or religious Islamic marriage ceremonies , which often take place secretly in private houses with ' an imam and a couple of witnesses there ' - and which are used to get round our marriage laws .
So how do the polygamists get away with it here ?
Firstly , it needs to be understood that the generous benefits system allows any man and the partner he lives with to claim benefits together - even if the woman is not officially registered as his wife .
If they do marry , to avoid breaking Britain 's bigamy laws , such men often engage in a ceremony with their second or third wife in a Nikah secretly in their own homes and never register the union officially in this country .
Another technique is for the man to divorce his first wife under British law while continuing to live with her as his spouse under Islamic law .
He then gets a visa for a new wife to enter the country and can legally marry her here .
Moreover , our politically correct immigration rules state that if a husband has divorced his first wife under British law - and even if that divorce is actually suspected to be part of a plan to set up a polygamous household - a second wife from abroad must be allowed to come and live here .
During this investigation , I spoke to health workers and benefits officers who have seen at first - hand the scale of polygamy in Britain .
An NHS district nurse working in Tower Hamlets , East London , explained that it was now commonplace .
He said he knew of a Bangladeshi - born male patient with two wives and 13 children aged between three months and 15 years .
' The women have council flats , each paid for by the local authority .
The elderly husband collects benefits for both women , who are in their 30s .
The wives speak very little English , but they are in and out of each other 's flats and are friends .
' On more than one occasion when I have been called to the flats to give treatment to the old man , I have heard them talking in the kitchen and even taking each other 's children to the park . '
The male nurse said this family set - up was not unusual .
' I know of others that comprise of one husband , a number of wives and numerous children .
' It is not difficult to conclude that if there were no state benefits , a man could not afford to live like this , especially here in London .
' The system is at fault .
The men want more wives for their sexual pleasure , but also because it is lucrative . '
Yet there is another issue to be raised .
Are the Government figures of around 1,000 foreign men living polygamously a gross underestimate ?
Recently , a senior imam in Finchley , North London , said there are at least 4,000 men involved in such marriages .
Meanwhile , to show just how far some men have stretched the teaching of the Koran , another senior Islamist , Dr Ghayasuddin Siddiqui , of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain , has revealed a case of a man living here with five wives .
But what , indeed , of the wives living in polygamous marriages themselves ?
In an age of supposed sexual equality , how can they accept what many will feel is the degradation that goes hand in hand with polygamy ?
Not surprisingly , few dare to speak out publicly for fear that they will be ostracised by their families .
But one 34 - year - old mother who lives in the Bangladeshi community of East London rang the Mail because she said she wants to reveal the truth of what is happening .
Sitting in her kitchen in Newham , she reeled off a list of male relatives and friends who have two or three wives .
What is more , the woman - who does not want to be named for fear of attacks on her and her family - said that polygamy is tacitly encouraged by our benefits system , where few questions are asked or checks made .
The woman , whom we will call Kaela , arrived in Britain with her mother and younger brother when she was 11 .
They were following her father , who had come to Britain from a poor province called Sylhet , seeking work in the food factories of West London .
Kaela learned English , went to a local comprehensive and , at 19 , fell in love with a Bangladeshi - born boy who had also arrived in this country as a youngster .
They married , set up home in a small council flat and soon had two children .
Kaela worked hard for her family .
With a clutch of GCSEs , she became an adviser to the Bangladeshi community on issues such as welfare , housing and education .
She now works as a parttime civil servant .
Yet , two years ago , her husband suddenly disappeared back to Bangladesh and , in an Islamic Nikah ceremony , married a 19 - year - old second wife who has since given birth to his son .
' My husband has a British passport and plans to come back into this country with his two - year - old boy and his new wife .
' He has not given me a penny .
He knows that the State will provide for us .
He has told me to tell the authorities I have been deserted and claim income support , housing benefit and council tax . '
But what of his second wife ?
Kaela suspects the shy teenager without any English will be brought into Britain on a tourist visa , pretending to be her own son's nanny .
' I have seen it happen before , ' Kaela explains .
' I know of one man living in East London who has two wives here , each with a flat , and a third wife in Bangladesh .
Between the wives , there are five children under 13 , all living in this country .
' The first two women look after the third wife 's child .
So who pays to keep this enormous family ?
The State , of course .
' I have an uncle who lives near Heathrow who has two wives .
They are all together in a big five - bedroom house , with off - street parking .
It is a council flat and the rent is paid from housing benefits because he does not work .
' The first wife , who is 60 , claims pension credit and carer 's allowance to look after his old mother , whom he has brought here as a dependent from Bangladesh .
' His much younger second wife claims income support for herself and child benefits for their three children of school age .
We are talking about hundreds of pounds a week to keep this family going .'
Kaela says there are myriad tricks used to bring second wives into Britain .
Apart from the ' nanny ruse ' , new female partners enter the country using tourist visas , student visas or work permits .
They simply overstay the visas , which are normally for six months , and stay in Britain , often hiding away in their husband 's home .
But women suffer as a result of polygamy , says Kaela .
' The first wives get depressed because they are so ashamed of their husband taking a second or third wife .
' Many wives have been here for years , but have never been allowed to learn English or even go out of the house alone .
They have no one to turn to for help . '
No one knows such anguish better than Sameera , a well - spoken , middle - aged woman living in one of our multi-cultural cities , whose 55 - year - old husband found a second wife after 30 years of marriage .
He went on holiday to his homeland of Pakistan where , without Sameera 's knowledge or consent , he married a 26 - year - old cousin .
' I fainted when I heard , ' says Sameera .
' The fact that he 's married a girl young enough to be his daughter has upset me so much .
' I cried .
I felt like my mind was exploding .
The ground had just fallen from me .
Why did he do it ?
It should n't happen . '
Astonishingly , though , Sameera has been forced to welcome the new wife into her house .
The alternative , she says , would be the breakdown of her relationship with her husband and , possibly , the loss of her home .
In other words , she might be thrown on to the streets .
Yet despite such emotional cruelty , there are those who say polygamy should be legal in multicultural Britain .
A leading Muslim academic at Cambridge University has claimed that men are biologically designed to desire more than one woman and that , therefore , polygamy should be legalised .
Meanwhile , a primary school teacher in Birmingham recently spoke publicly about his contented life with two wives and six children , all living in the same house .
Even a prominent female member of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain - set up in 1992 to debate Islamic issues - has claimed that she knows of many very happy polygamous marriages in Britain .
' I am aware that this practice is taking place , and there are couples who are quite satisfied with their relationship , and they would like it to carry on and be protected by law , ' she proclaimed .
Back at the immigration appeals centre at Taylor House , which heard the case of Somali - born polygamist Abdi , a Home Office lawyer took me aside and whispered : ' This man 's not the only husband doing this .
' Last week , there was one man who was born in Pakistan and arrived to settle here only four years ago .
He brought in one wife legally .
They arrived as asylum seekers .
The next wife came in on a student 's visa .
The third pretended to be visiting relatives in Southwark , South London .
She had a sixmonth tourist visa but overstayed and was about to be deported .
' She ended up here , begging to remain in Britain with her husband . '
As for Abdi , I spoke to his son after the case adjourned as he waited for a bus with his mother , Fatima , while his father went back to work .
The polite , intelligent - teenager is studying at college and hopes to become an engineer .
He came to Britain with his mother ( who speaks only a few words of English ) as asylum seekers from Somalia several years after Abdi had made the journey alone seeking a job , money and a better future .
' I knew my father had a second wife , ' the teenager said with a friendly smile .
' That is not unusual in Somalia .
I want to stay in Britain , and so does my mother .
Our lives should not be shattered because of this .'
But British taxpayers footing the bill may beg to disagree .

Via Larisa , yet another detainee ordered released after the real judicial system , rather than Bush 's kangaroo courts , examines the evidence against him .
It is the second time that U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon has ordered the release of a detainee after examining government evidence , most of it classified .
Leon said that the Justice Department failed to prove that Mohammed El Gharani , 21 , is an enemy combatant because it relied heavily on statements made by two other detainees whose credibility is questionable .
A mosaic of tiles this murky reveals nothing about this petitioner with sufficient clarity " to justify his detention , Leon ruled .
Gharani , a citizen of Chad , was picked up in Pakistan and turned over to the United States in 2002 .
Since then , he has been held at Guantanamo Bay .
Among the ridiculous claims made was that Gharani had been a member of a London al Qaida cell .
At the time , he was aged 11 and living in Saudi Arabia - an accusation based entirely upon statements made by other camp detainees which were not proven true by US investigators , just believed .
He was illegally seized in Pakistan aged 14 and is now 21 .

Worst drought ever expected after mild January More water rationing , higher produce costs predicted - mild January pushes state into 3rd straight dry year
Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Worst drought ever expected after mild January 1 / 4 Back to Gallery
California teeters on the edge of the worst drought in the state 's history , officials said Thursday after reporting that the Sierra Nevada snowpack - the backbone of the state 's water supply - is only 61 percent of normal .
January usually douses California with about 20 percent of the state 's annual precipitation , but instead it delivered a string of dry , sunny days this year , almost certainly pushing the state into a third year of drought .
The arid weather is occurring as the state 's water system is under pressure from a growing population , an aging infrastructure and court - ordered reductions in water pumped through the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta - problems that did n't exist or were less severe during similar dry spells in the late 1970s and late 1980s .
" We 're definitely in really bad shape , " said Elissa Lynn , chief meteorologist with the state Department of Water Resources .
" People can expect to pay higher prices for produce ... and more agencies may be rationing ... some raising fees .
We just do n't have enough water . "
In Sonoma County , water managers are expected to take a bold step Monday - telling residents to prepare for severe rationing within weeks .
" We have entered uncharted territory , " said Pam Jeane , deputy chief engineer of operations at the Sonoma County Water Agency .
" A 30 percent mandatory rationing order is just the beginning .
Further decline in reservoir levels could necessitate 50 percent cutbacks . "
After two consecutive dry years and with a third on the way , Lake Mendocino , one of two main reservoirs that supply 750,000 residents in Marin and Sonoma counties , contains only 32,000 acre - feet of water - about one - third of its capacity of 90,000 acre - feet .
( One acre - foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre at a depth of one foot , enough to meet the needs of one to two families each year ) .
The picture is similar around the state .
Lake Shasta , the largest reservoir in California , is at 31 percent of its capacity , down from 74 percent in 2007 .
By now , water planners had hoped a series of strong storms would fill up reservoirs and make further rationing unnecessary .
But a high - pressure system parked over Northern California has kept skies clear and warm through most of the winter .
Thursday 's snow survey by the Department of Water Resources found that the snow's water content - the snowpack - across the Sierra Nevada was 61 percent of normal for this time of year .
Last year at this time , the snowpack was 111 percent of normal , but the driest spring on record led to a drought .
The saturation level of snow , or the snow 's water content , is the most important factor affecting the crucial spring runoff levels , which help water planners determine water supplies for their districts each season .
If Sonoma County institutes 50 percent rationing , it would be the Bay Area 's most drastic measure so far to address the drought .
Last spring , the East Bay Municipal Utility District announced 15 percent rationing and added extra drought fees .
Many other districts are relying on voluntary cutbacks .
San Francisco has asked users to trim water use by 10 percent .
But the city and others could move to rationing this spring , potentially barring customers from filling pools , washing cars or watering lawns .
No customers would suffer more than agricultural districts in Central Valley , where farmers expect they will receive no water from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for their alfalfa , corn , pears and almonds .
Critics charge farmers with wasting water by flooding fields and growing low - value crops .
But growers insist they are increasing efficiency at the same time they supply the nation with critical food supplies .
Wine is not a critical food supply , but the economies of Napa and Sonoma counties stand to lose tens of millions of dollars if the drought squeezes this year 's grape harvest .
Already , there are signs that vines are sprouting early - exposing grapes to frost for a longer period of time .
Like commercial farmers in the Central Valley , grape growers might be forced to water some plots and not others .
" If you have limited water , and you do n't have the irrigation to keep it going ... it 's not going to be a bumper crop , " said Nick Frey , president of the Sonoma County Winegrape Commission .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger used Thursday 's snow survey to pitch his answer to California 's water crisis - a $ 9 billion - plus water bond that would funnel money toward new dams , reservoirs , water recycling programs and conservation efforts .
The governor also supports building a giant pipeline , called a peripheral canal , around the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta to reduce pressure on the ailing water system .
In 2007 , a federal judge said operators of the giant export pumps near Tracy must curtail pumping in order to save the endangered delta smelt , a tiny fish .
Tennessee football Coach Lane Kiffin was reprimanded by the Southeastern Conference on Thursday for falsely accusing Florida Coach Urban Meyer of a recruiting violation , and the new Volunteers coach has apologized for his remarks .
Kiffin told fans attending a breakfast to celebrate his first recruiting class that Meyer violated recruiting rules by phoning wide receiver prospect Nu’Keese Richardson , WVLT - TV reported .
“ I love the fact that Urban had to cheat and still did n’t get him , ” Kiffin said .
NCAA and Southeastern Conference officials said it is not against recruiting rules to contact a prospect while he is on an official visit to another school .

Kiffin later issued a statement apologizing , and said he was trying to excite the crowd of donors and alumni .
Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley said the comments were slanderous and violated SEC rules against publicly criticizing another coach and school .
Richardson , a Pahokee , Fla. , native , signed with the Volunteers , despite having indicated he would sign with the Gators .
Jawanza Starling , a defensive back from Lincoln High in Tallahassee , Fla. , became the 18th recruit to sign a letter of intent to play football at USC .

The most grotesque outcome I can possibly imagine for the Obama stimulus plan would likely become reality if , on top of a new set of carbon tax guidelines , most of the billions spent on physical infrastructure went to roads and bridges instead of neglected public rail transport .
Worryingly , this is exactly the outcome we are headed for now , as an unintentional barbell policy develops where highly sophisticated green advocates shape carbon and climate policy at one end of the stimulus plan , and then the nation ’s Governors favor roads and automobile infrastructure over rail at the other end .
Let me try to both clarify and simplify why this would be a fiasco on both an environmental and a macroeconomic level .
First , the lack of sufficient commuter rail and light rail is an enormous macroeconomic problem that the country is struggling with right now , and has been struggling with for years .
The lost work hours and wasted capital endured in at least 10 - 15 large American cities would , if captured , likely represent a non-trivial shift in the nation ’s GDP .
I have identified at least five US metro areas where , in my opinion , massive new ( or additional ) investment in commuter rail and light rail would , over a several year period , reshape downtowns , attract and organize real estate development , and capture lost work hours .
They are : Seattle , SF Bay , LA - Orange - SD Counties , Dallas - Ft Worth , and Miami .
Notice that four of these are in the West , the portion of the United States that saw most of its greatest population growth during the age of the automobile .
Essentially , post - war growth .
While all of these cities have made good starts already with some form of rail , it would serve the country well to throw not just billions , but hundreds of billions at all five .
On an environmental level it is nothing less than absurd to entertain sweeping new carbon and climate legislation if we are not going to get cars off the road .
Higher fuel efficiency is a worthy goal .
But higher fuel efficiency cars make little difference if they join each morning the millions of vehicles stuck in traffic jams across the country , idling their engines .
The value proposition of commuter and light rail is so powerful , on so many different levels , that I cannot understand why it ’s not in the Number One position in current discussions of the Obama plan .
It should be above Carbon and Climate issues , Solar and Wind issues , vehicle standards issues , and certainly well above Road and Bridge issues .
The only comparable investment theme I find in the proposed stimulus plan relates to the Grid .
We will indeed need a new Grid to feed power from new sources of utility grade solar and wind , into electrified public rail transport .
The Obama team appears suddenly quite confused on a number of levels , as we approach the inauguration .
For example , if one agrees we ’re in a liquidity trap and that Keynesian policy holds the answer , then Tax Cuts should be almost completely off the table .
They ’ll do nothing .
Tax cuts–again , if you believe we are in a deflationary liquidity trap–are nothing more than the fiscal equivalent of cutting interest rates .
More importantly , while Obama has sounded the correct economic goal when saying he wants investments that have large , back - end payoffs , there is simply no competition from investment in roads and bridges when compared to rail transport .
The problem the country faces right now is that we already invested in the wrong things .
Wrong things have little sustainable payoff .
We invested in Houses and Cars , and did so for decades .
But houses and cars are really just tools that are supposed to set us up to do the larger work .
In the United States the car and the home became economic fetishes .
Alot of the country now lives in a home that ’s too big , in a town too far from work .
Continuing to invest in this structure is crazy , given that oil prices will be sky - high again in the near future .
Politically , however , it will be difficult for the nation ’s Governors to do otherwise , and therein lies a problem .

Despite pleas from users to stop the confusion and craft one version of Windows 7 , Microsoft is continuing down the path it followed with XP and Vista releasing multiple versions or SKUs ( stock - keeping units ) of Windows 7 .
Six Windows 7 versions , to be precise .
But most users only need to decide between two versions .
Microsoft has said that 80 percent of users will be deploying Windows 7 Home Premium ( consumers ) or Windows 7 Professional ( small businesses , remote workers ) .
This is where Microsoft will put most of its marketing muscle .
" We have over 1 billion customers .
It 's hard to satisfy all of them [ with a single version ] , " Windows General Manager Mike Ybarra has said .
" There are vocal customers who want every feature , and more regular consumers who say ' I want a version that can grow with me . ' "

Yet some analysts are accusing Microsoft of manipulating customers and padding profit margins with the high number of versions and bloggers are emphasizing that three versions are enough .
Here 's a look at the features of each of the six Windows flavors and who might want them .
Microsoft has not yet announced pricing for Windows 7 .
Windows 7 Starter
This is the bare - bones , 32 - bit only version of Windows 7 intended for users in developing countries , to serve the most basic computing needs .
Starter is designed for lightweight , portable netbooks , though Microsoft claims any of its versions will be able to run on netbooks .
Windows Starter 7 will not have the Aero Glass graphical user interface that is included in all other versions of Windows 7 ( except Windows 7 Home Basic ) and can only run three applications at a time .
It will include the revamped taskbar and jump lists , Windows Media Player , the file - sharing feature Home Group ( you can participate in a Home Group but cannot create one ) and other basic features such as Action Center and Backup and Restore .
Starter will not be available in retail stores , and will only be offered pre-installed on new PCs by Microsoft OEMs .
Windows 7 Home Basic
Home Basic sits somewhere between Starter and Home Premium .
It has all the features of Windows 7 Starter and will also only be available through OEM partners in developing countries .
Also like Starter , it will not include the Aero Glass GUI .
Some of the features Home Basic has over Starter : the ability to run more than three applications at once ; a 64 - bit version ; thumbnail previews from the taskbar ; and Mobility Center , which allows you to manage the various networks that you connect to with your laptop .
Based on what Microsoft has announced about Home Basic ( which is not very much ) , it shares the same features as Windows 7 Home Premium except there are no Aero Glass GUI features and other UI tweaks such as Aero Snap , Aero Peek and multi- touch .
This version will not will not legally be available for sale in the United States .
Windows 7 Home Premium
Windows 7 Home Premium has all the features of Starter and Home Basic and then some .
This is the mainstream retail version that nearly all consumers will be using .
Windows 7
Home Premium will be available worldwide to Microsoft OEMs and sold in retail stores loaded on new PCs .
A step up from Windows Home Basic , Home Premium includes the Aero Glass GUI and new Windows navigation features such as Aero Glass , Aero Background , Windows Touch , Home Group creation , Media Center , DVD playback and creation , premium games and Mobility Center .
Windows 7 Professional
Also available worldwide , to OEMs and in retail , Windows 7 Professional has the features of Home Premium , but with added networking and data protection features for small businesses and those who frequently work at home .

Microsoft may have a hard time convincing customers that Home Premium is n't good enough for a small business — considering it is bound to be less expensive than Professional — but if it succeeds it will be by marketing Professional features such as Domain Join to connect to business networks , Encrypting File System for data protection and Location Aware Printing to better connect to printers at work and home .
Windows 7 Professional will not include the more buzzed - about business features such as DirectAccess and BranchCache .
They show up in the next version up the food chain , Windows 7 Enterprise .
Windows 7 Enterprise
Windows 7
Enterprise is only available to businesses through volume licensing .
It includes all the features of Windows 7 Professional plus more security and networking features .
Businesses covered by Microsoft's Software Assurance will get Windows 7 Enterprise at no additional charge .
Features that differentiate Enterprise from Professional are : BitLocker ( encrypts data on internal and external drives ) ; DirectAccess ( connectivity to a corporate network without VPN ) ; AppLocker ( prevents unauthorized software from running ) ; and BranchCache ( speeds up the accessing of large remote files at branch offices ) .
Windows 7
Enterprise is designed for the corporate world and will only be used by large businesses .
It will not be available at retail or by OEMs for pre-installation on a new PC .
Windows 7 Ultimate
Ultimate , the supersize version of Windows , includes all the features of all the other versions .
Think of it as Windows 7 Enterprise for consumers .
Ultimate will be the most expensive version , so it 's doubtful that many people will use it other than the occasional super - user who wants every possible feature .
Microsoft is not likely to heavily promote Windows 7 Ultimate .
Most regular users do not need all the security and networking features and there does n't appear to be much in Ultimate for businesses that is n't already in Windows 7 Enterprise .
Microsoft has said that OEMs will be able to pre-install Windows 7 Ultimate on new machines and that there will be limited availability in retail .

Tonnes of toxic waste collected from British municipal dumps is being sent illegally to Africa in flagrant breach of this country ’s obligation to ensure its rapidly growing mountain of defunct televisions , computers and gadgets are disposed of safely .
Hundreds of thousands of discarded items , which under British law must be dismantled or recycled by specialist contractors , are being packaged into cargo containers and shipped to countries such as Nigeria and Ghana , where they are stripped of their raw metals by young men and children working on poisoned waste dumps .
In a joint investigation by The Independent , Sky News , and Greenpeace , a television that had been broken beyond repair was tracked to an electronics market in Lagos , Nigeria , after being left at a civic amenity site in Basingstoke run by Hampshire Country Council .
Under environmental protection laws
It was classified as hazardous waste and should never have left the UK .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The television , fitted with a satellite tracking device , was bought by a London - based dealer , one of dozens of operators buying up a significant proportion of the estimated 940,000 tonnes of domestic electronic waste , or e-waste , produced in the UK each year and sending it for export .
Investigators bought back the television after a 4,500 - mile journey from Tilbury Docks in Essex to the giant Alaba electronics market in Lagos , where up to 15 shipping containers of discarded electronics from Europe and Asia arrive every day .
At least a third of the contents of each container is broken beyond use and transferred to dumps where waste pickers scavenge amid a cocktail of burning heavy metals and dioxins .
The television is just one example of a broader problem with the enforcement of the legislation , which permits the export of functioning equipment but prohibits broken electronic goods from being sent outside the EU to a country with a developing economy .
Such is the confused state of the recycling industry , with some local authorities collating figures on the amount of waste being exported and others simply handing the task to sub-contractors , that the e-waste body representing the electronics industry admits abuse is widespread .
Claire Snow , the director of the Industry Council for Equipment Recycling ( ICER ) , told The Independent : “ It is clear that the system for collecting equipment which UK householders have thrown away is not working as well as it should .
“ On the pretext of re-use , equipment which is clearly not suitable for any type of re-use is effectively being dumped in developing countries . ”
Government figures show that 450,000 tonnes of e-waste is currently being treated in accordance with Britain ’s waste electronic and electrical equipment laws , which place a responsibility on manufacturers to meet the environmental cost .
But with the average Briton throwing away four pieces of e-waste every year , approximately 500,000 tonnes is going unaccounted for .
Industry research seen by The Independent estimates that at least 10,000 tonnes of waste televisions and 23,000 tonnes of computers classified as hazardous waste are being illegally exported as part of a wider e-waste market worth “ tens of millions of pounds ” .
Campaigners say dealers offering around £ 3 for a television and £ 1 for a computer monitor to waste sites are undercutting specialist recycling companies , creating a “ grey market ” .
Britain is responsible for around 15 per cent of the EU ’s total e-waste , which is growing three times faster than any other muncipal waste stream .
Martin Hojsik , toxics campaigner for Greenpeace International , said : " Companies can stop this illegal toxic trade now by ensuring their goods are free from hazardous components .
It is critical they and governments take full responsibility for the safe recycling of their products and put an end to the growing e-waste dumps that are poisoning people . "
Bosses at Hampshire County Council last night launched an inquiry into its waste sites but insisted it and its household waste site contractor , Hopkins Recycling , only used dealers who exported functional equipment .
A spokesman for Consumers International , which is campaigning for tightened e- waste controls , said : “ The sight of children scavenging toxic wastelands overflowing with the West ’s unwanted computers and televisions makes a mockery of international bans to prevent the dumping of e-waste .
Western governments , including the UK , have shown little desire to deal with the root cause of this problem . ”
WASHINGTON --
The Central Intelligence Agency's new director outlined spy policies Wednesday , including an aggressive campaign in Pakistan , that underscored considerable continuity with the Bush administration .
CIA Director Leon Panetta , in his first meeting with reporters , said the agency will continue to carry out drone attacks on militants in Pakistan .
He also said that while CIA interrogations will have new limits , President Barack Obama can still use his wartime powers to authorize harsher techniques if necessary .

DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Ford Motor
Co reported a record $ 14.6 billion full - year loss on Thursday but said it would have the cash to survive the worst downturn in auto sales in decades without a U.S. government bailout .
Ford plans to cut some 2,500 white - collar jobs and draw down its remaining credit line after burning through $ 5.5 billion of cash as global auto sales plunged .
The automaker posted a deeper - than - expected $ 5.9 billion fourth quarter net loss .
Ford has reported net losses totaling nearly $ 30 billion over the past three years .
For the year , Ford burned through $ 21 billion but said it expected that it would be able to better conserve cash in 2009 if U.S. sales stabilize in the second half as it expects .
The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said it would draw down $ 10.1 billion remaining on its credit line and defer $ 2 billion in payments pledged to a trust aligned with the United Auto Workers to add to its cash position in the first quarter .
“ We took this action because of our growing concerns about the instability of the capital markets , ” Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally told analysts in a conference call .
Ford shares were down 3 percent in afternoon trade .
Analysts lauded Ford under Mulally with having the foresight to borrow heavily in 2006 , before credit markets shut down and auto sales plunged in 2008 .
“ They ’re doing what they can to take costs out but the other side of the equation -- sales -- has got to recover , ” said Erich Merkle , an independent auto analyst .
Ford ’s captive credit arm , Ford Motor Credit , said it would cut 1,200 jobs , or 20 percent of its staff .
For its auto operations , Ford said it had almost completed 1,300 white - collar job cuts that it began in November .
Ford said the UAW had also agreed to suspend its jobs bank , dropping a program that had guaranteed nearly full wages and benefits for workers after their jobs were eliminated .
Ford had about 1,500 UAW workers in its jobs bank at the end of 2008 .
Suspending the jobs bank had been a condition imposed by the federal government for the $ 17.4 billion bailout of Ford ’s rivals General Motors Corp and Chrysler .
GM and Chrysler both had previously announced an end to the program .
Overall , Ford cut its North American auto workforce by 5,000 jobs in the fourth quarter to 75,200 , most of that in its hourly workforce .
The Ford Credit , and salaried job cuts will be reflected in 2009 results .
NO SIGNS OF RECOVERY
“ I think it ’s by far the most volatile period we ’ve ever seen , ” Chief Financial Officer Lewis Booth told reporters .
“ We ’re not seeing any signs of recovery yet . ”
Still , Booth said Ford was expecting some recovery in the U.S. market in the second half of the year and he expected it would be the first region to show signs of a rebound .
Ford ’s net loss widened to $ 5.88 billion , or $ 2.46 per share , in the quarter , from $ 2.8 billion , or $ 1.33 per share , a year earlier .

Ford Motor Credit , traditionally a source of profit , slipped to a $ 372 million quarterly loss on credit - related charges , derivatives losses and lower loan volumes .
Volvo , a the Swedish luxury brand Ford is looking to sell , posted a forth - quarter loss of $ 736 million on a pre-tax basis , down from a break - even position a year earlier .
Ford offered no details on the sale process .
Executives said the Volvo review would take some time and the brand ’s management is focused on fixing the business .
Ford ended 2008 with $ 13.4 billion cash .
It said it would receive the $ 10.1 billion from its line of credit on February 3 .
Ford has asked for a $ 9 billion line of credit from the U.S. government as insurance against a worsening in the global economy .
It also expects to receive $ 5 billion of direct loans from a U.S. program to support improved fuel economy .
Industry - wide U.S. auto sales fell 18 percent in 2008 and are expected to fall for a fourth consecutive year in 2009 , ratcheting up pressure on automakers in the world ’s largest and most profitable market .
Ford remains more optimistic than most industry forecasts for 2009 , even though it cut its industry - wide U.S. sales forecast to a range of 11.5 million to 12.5 million units including medium and heavy trucks from the range it used in Congressional testimony last year .
The automaker trimmed its first quarter production plan by 30,000 units in North America to 400,000 units , a cut that will add to the considerable pressure on its supply base .
Ford does not contemplate a cash injection for former parts unit Visteon Corp , whose stock has fallen to 16 cents per share .

Microsoft 's Seadragon graphics viewing application has come under fire for allegedly distributing pornography to unsuspecting iPhone users , presumably those unfamiliar with the way the internet works these days .
Seadragon is a powerful graphics viewer for the iPhone , distributed free by Microsoft Live Labs , and includes an array of example graphics including maps from the library of congress and the Orion Nebular .
But it also connects to Microsoft 's Photosynth service - which is where the problems lie , as this breathless posting on MacRumours explains :
" Porn in Microsoft 's Seadragon !
Yes I know , hard to believe but its true !
Download Seadragon by microsoft then go to Browse Photosynth .
Then the libraries named " home_two " and " home_s12 " are full of it .
This is ridiculous !
Some one [ sic ] is getting fired for this one ! "
Photosynth allows users to upload huge numbers of images of the same place / thing , which are then stitched together automatically to provide a new kind of viewing experience - the project comes from a startup Microsoft purchased in 2006 who have produced some very impressive demonstrations of their photo - stitching technology .
That technology is now an open service that allows anyone to upload anything - though content of an adult nature will be swiftly removed by Microsoft as there are no content filters or age restrictions in place , and that 's what happened in this case .
But few of those posting to MacRumours seem to understand where their content is coming from , as one poster puts it : " This is a bit disturbing ...
If there were one picture misplaced somewhere in a sea of perfectly PG , then I could understand ... But TWO FOLDERS ? "
Microsoft acted swiftly to remove the content concerned , but the more anti-Microsoft iPhone users are still chanting " think of the children " and worrying about the beast of Redmond corrupting our youth .
The rest of us are just being quietly impressed that Microsoft managed to turn out such a nice application for the iPhone . ®
Incomprehensible as it sound , inflation poses that the universe initially expanded far faster than the speed of light and grew from a subatomic size to a golf - ball size almost instantaneously .
The universe appears to be lopsided , and a new model that aims to explain this anomaly could offer a glimpse of what happened before the birth of it all .
When astronomers look out at the cosmos , the view in one direction is turning out to be different than in the other .
Specifically , fluctuations in the density and temperature of the radiation left over from the theoretical Big Bang — called the Cosmic Microwave Background — seem to be strangely larger on one side of the universe .
A new model suggests this unevenness could be caused by an imprint left over from before the beginning of the universe , that is , before the cosmos ballooned almost instantaneously from less than the size of an atom to about golf - ball size .
This process is called inflation .
Blowing up the balloon
" Inflation theory does predict that we have these density and temperature fluctuations , but they should look the same everywhere across the sky , " said Caltech astrophysicist Sean Carroll , who worked on the new model , detailed in the Dec. 16 issue of the journal Physical Review D. " But people who look at the data say they see one side of the universe has bigger fluctuations , and that 's what we 're trying to get a handle on . "
Scientists think the normal variations in temperature and density predicted by inflation became the seeds for the structure we see today throughout the universe .
Soon after inflation , the denser areas would have attracted more matter and eventually grown into the clusters and galaxies we see today , while less dense regions would have become voids mostly absent of galaxies , stars and planets .
But the normal model of inflation can't account for the asymmetry now noted .
To try to explain that , Carroll , astrophysicist Marc Kamionkowski and graduate student Adrienne Erickcek ( all at Caltech ) tested a new version of inflation theory , in which two fields are responsible for the universe 's early bloom of expansion .
In the standard theory of inflation , one field called the inflaton ( not inflation ) caused both the rapid expansion of the universe and its density fluctuations .
But Kamionkowski and team found that an unevenness in the density fluctuations could arise if inflation is caused by two fields instead of one .
In the new model , the inflaton is responsible for ballooning the size of the universe , while a second field called the curvaton that had been previously proposed introduces the density variations .
Before the Big Bang ?
The model also intriguingly hints at what might have come before inflation , since it suggests that the universe 's lopsidedness may be an aftereffect of a great fluctuation that occurred before inflation began .
" It 's no longer completely crazy to ask what happened before the Big Bang , " Kamionkowski said .
" All of that stuff is hidden by a veil , observationally .
If our model holds up , we may have a chance to see beyond this veil . "
The next step is to gather better data about the Cosmic Microwave Background , to confirm that the unevenness seen so far really holds up .
" So far it seems to be in the data , but that does n't mean it's in the universe , " Carroll told SPACE.com .
" There 's a chance this asymmetry is coming from errors in the data . "
A new European Space Agency satellite called Planck , designed to map the background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution , is set to launch in 2009 .
If Planck finds the radiation densities to be off - balance , too , then cosmologists must really come to terms with this puzzling aspect of inflation .
Though it would require some serious amendments to current theories , many physicists would relish the challenge .
" That 's what everyone wants — it 's much more interesting that way , " Carroll said .
Good riddance to Valentine 's Day !
It 's a cynical , irritating and expensive con
Home alone this Valentine 's Day : Tanya Gold hates the commercial , unoriginal love fest of February 14th
Is it safe to come out yet ?
Have the heart - shaped balloons sagged and floated away ?
Have the cheap champagne bottles rolled under the sofa ?
Has the red viscose seduction wear fallen to the floor to be forgotten ?
Is Valentine 's Day really over for yet another year ?
Can I crawl out from under the bed ?
Every year I approach Valentine 's Day with peculiar dread .
I spend most of the day with a towel over my mouth , so I wo n't be sick .
Why do I want to kick over the Valentine 's Day restaurant promotion signs - Spend £ 200 Because You Are In Love ! - and blow up the I Love You , You Are My Special Bunny Rabbit cards ?
Ideally in a giant pink and polyester explosion that would be visible from space ?
Because Valentine 's Day is tyrannical and imposed upon us all .
It is like an ' Everyone Be in Love ' party organised by the Government .
It is also weirdly like paying taxes .
It 's expensive , incredibly irritating and everyone has to do it .
If you do n't take part , you are possibly suspicious and probably dangerous .
On January 31 , you pay the taxman .
On February 14 , you declare your love .
I looked up the source of Valentine 's Day .
There are two St Valentines .
One is a total mystery , and the other was stoned and then decapitated by a Roman emperor called Claudius , presumably for founding Valentine 's Day .
( I 'd have done something much worse to him ) .
Also , birds apparently choose their mates on February 14 .
So , when you slip on a cheap dress and eat a cheap steak in front of a cheap man in the name of cheap love , you are actually copying a pigeon .
Yes , a pigeon .
Pigeonwoman !
Stick that in a heart - shaped cookie cutter and eat it .
Cash splash :
We spent £ 1.6 billion on Valentine 's Day this year
Love - of course - is all about intimacy .
Well , it 's supposed to be , and like a glittering , sobbing snowflake , no two loves are ever the same .
Except on Valentine 's
Day when everything is the same - the stupid cards , the gross food , the matching couples with matching expressions .
When everyone is doing it , at the same time and in the same way , how can it be personal ?
How can it be special ?
How can it be yours ?
Would anyone with Great Love really do anything on the day , except vomit ?
Can you really see Rick and Ilsa from Casablanca celebrating Valentine 's Day ?
Or Scarlett and Rhett from Gone With The Wind ?
Is n't celebrating February 14 just like slipping into the Ikea of love , with everyone queuing up to buy the same flat - packed emotions ?
Toa large extent it is about love - the love of money , that is .
Everywhere you go , there are retailers and service providers waving hearts and flowers , desperate to rip you off .
A deli on my High Street was charging £ 49 for a Valentine 's breakfast .
You got two croissants , a carton of orange juice and some naff sparkling wine .
Is that romantic ?
Or is it theft ?
It 's a difficult day for men , too - full of heart - shaped landmines .
The cool ones ignore it , either because they know it 's rubbish or because football - and - Top - Gear Valentine 's
Day cards have yet to be invented ( give it time ) .
But what if your boyfriend does celebrate the day ?
Does n't that make him an idiot whose imagination has been surgically removed , along with the £ 200 he paid for an indifferent dinner ?
But , even worse , what if he does n't ?
Does that mean he does n't love you ?
Want you ?
Care ?
On Valentine 's
Day your man can be one of two things - a fool or a pig .
And how would you feel if your man actually proposed to you on Valentine 's Day ?
I 'd feel as if I had just made love to a malfunctioning robot .
So I spent the day under the bed , and I hope you did , too .
Because love means never having to say : ' I 'll have a table for two on Valentine 's Day . '

KABUL , Dec 23 ( Reuters ) - America's top military officer announced a near - doubling of U.S. troops in Afghanistan at the weekend , and then flew east to cool tensions between Pakistan and India .
The reason ?
It 's all part of the same security equation .
If a " surge " of up to 30,000 extra soldiers to Afghanistan by next summer is the tactic chosen to beat the Taliban insurgency there , holding India and Pakistan back from each others ' throats is the strategy to ensure peace across the region as a whole .
" The surge is not an answer by itself , " said Brahma Chellaney , professor of strategic studies at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi .
" It 's not the number of troops , it 's the strategy . "
Last month 's attacks by suspected Pakistan - based militants in the Indian city of Mumbai , in which 179 people died , has halted the faltering peace process between New Delhi and Islamabad .
While neither side has moved to a war footing , the prospect of a conflict must be concentrating minds in the Pentagon and NATO .
For one thing , there is a risk Pakistan would move some of the nearly 100,000 troops it has on its western border , with Afghanistan , to reinforce security along its frontier with India , with which it has already fought three wars since 1947 .
That would take pressure off Taliban fighters who hide in the borderlands planning attacks on Western forces in Afghanistan .
" High tension between Pakistan and India does n't serve American interests .
It undermines America 's agenda to control terrorism and that will only succeed if India - Pakistan relations are normalised , " said Professor Hasaan Askari Rizvi , a Pakistani academic and political analyst .
" Pakistan 's attention has now been diverted from the tribal areas to the eastern border which means the Taliban and other militant groups now have greater freedom and that means they can engage in more activities . "
Vanda Felbab - Brown , a Brookings Institution security expert , said Pakistan had stepped up the fight against militants , but not enough , and may lose the will to press on because of Mumbai .
" Our hand is going to be weaker now due to Pakistan 's tensions with India , " she said .
" It 's quite possible that even the willingness they have generated up to now they will lose for the next two months . "
FEAR OF ENCIRCLEMENT
Afghan officials often accuse elements within Pakistan 's ISI spy agency of secretly supporting Taliban insurgents .
Pakistan denies the charge , but analysts say many of its military brass are suspicious of the ties between Afghanistan and India and fear encirclement with a hostile India on its eastern flank and hostile Afghan forces , backed by New Delhi , on the west .
Increased tension with India would only reinforce those who argue that the Taliban are a useful foreign policy tool .
" Some ( but not all ) in the establishment see armed militants within Pakistan as a threat -- but they largely consider it one that is ultimately controllable , and in any case secondary to the threat posed by their nuclear - armed enemies , " wrote Barnett Rubin and Ahmed Rashid in the Foreign Affairs journal .
The commander of international forces in Afghanistan had actually sought extra troops before the Mumbai attacks , and long before U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen announced on Saturday that 20,000 - 30,000 more would be deployed .
So perhaps the " surge " would have happened anyway .
However , it was not by chance that Mullen flew to Islamabad two days later to lecture military chiefs there on the importance of joining hands with India " to combat ... extremism together " .
U.S. President - elect Barack Obama has made it clear he will adopt a dual strategy of maintaining peace between India and Pakistan and beating the Taliban , who remain a formidable force seven years after U.S. - led forces ousted them from power .
" Obama has also been clear that he sees the Pakistan situation very much through the prism of India , " said a NATO diplomat , who asked not to be named .
" So I think you see the whole U.S. administration taking a much wider regional focus , which is very very valuable . "

There is a press blackout on reviewing the Watchmen movie until March 6 .
However , I ’ve seen the movie , and I ’m not press .
Do n’t worry , I ’m not going to write a review of Watchmen .
What I am going to write about is the emotional experience of seeing a piece of literature with which I have an intense personal connection LITERALLY COME TO LIFE .
It ’s a serious freak - out .
I ’m not alone in having bonded with the Watchmen comic book back when it was first published .
But in 1986 , I sure felt like I was .
Barely anyone in my high school even knew who Wolverine was , let alone Rorschach .
Gradually , however , the awareness of the Watchmen graphic novel has spread from a small group of comic book readers to become a major cultural touchstone for an entire generation .
It ’s the common ground uniting almost everyone in my creative community .
And now it EXISTS .
I ’m not allowed to talk details , but let ’s just say it is astounding how much of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ’ graphic novel is in this movie .
( Really , the absence of Alan Moore ’s name on this is like Stan Lee ’s being missing from Spider - Man , because 95 percent of the words and ideas in this movie are all Moore . )
Has there ever been a movie adaptation of a comic book ( or book book ) this close to its source material ?
Probably the two Frank Miller movies , Sin City and 300 .
But , while awesome , Frank Miller ’s comics did n’t solve my Rubik ’s Cube of a 1980s teenage heart every single time I re-read them the way Moore ’s and Gibbons ’ did .
Sitting in that screening room and watching the visual world of the Watchmen movie unfold was one of the most powerful experiences I ’ve ever had .
Not film experiences .
Just EXPERIENCES .
I do n’t think I realized how close I was to the original book until I saw such a loving , detail - rich , almost obsessive recreation of that universe .
It had my heart pounding and head swimming .
I barely slept that night .
Someone took the most special personal thing of my adolescence and put it on a movie screen .
That does n’t happen every day .
What will people who ’ve never read Watchmen even think of this film ?
What will it be like for them to sit through these crazy , violent , colorful three hours and not recognize almost every line – almost every image ?
Will they be utterly baffled , bored , or totally love it ?
Is Watchmen even a good or bad movie ?
I have no idea .
I stand powerless before the Gods I once worshiped in my attic bedroom , now moving and talking and fighting and loving on a giant screen .
And I find myself unable to judge them .
For me , and I suspect many others , the movie wo n’t provoke the feeling you get from seeing a great movie , ( which Watchmen very well may be ) .
For me , Watchmen is n’t a movie at all .
It ’s a surreal mind - trip the likes of which my 14 - year - old self would never have believed .
Now , the special thing that still feels like only I know about has been given to the whole world .
I hope they like it .

Usability is an essential goal of any website , and usable navigation is something every website needs .
It determines where users are led and how they interact with the website .
Without usable navigation , content becomes all but useless .
Menus need to be simple enough for the user to understand , but also contain the elements necessary to guide the user through the website — with some creativity and good design thrown in .
This overview features a hand - picked and organized selection of the most useful and popular Smashing Magazine ’s articles related to Web Design navigation and published here over all the years .
When users look for information , they have a goal and are on a mission .
Even before you started to read this article , chances are you did because you either had the implicit goal of checking what ’s new on Smashing Magazine , or had the explicit goal of finding information about “ Navigation Design ” .
This article is about the tiniest of details that goes into creating the main centerpiece of your digital product — the construction of the elements of your navigation .
This is the most important aid you can possibly give to your users as they are constantly seeking a reason to walk out on you .

The thing that makes navigation difficult to work with in Web design is that it can be so versatile .
Navigation can be simple or complex : a few main pages or a multi - level architecture ; one set of content for logged - in users and another for logged - out users ; and so on .
Because navigation can vary so much between websites , there are no set guidelines or how - to ’s for organizing navigation .
Designing navigation is an art in itself , and designers become better at it with experience .
It ’s all about using good information architecture : “ the art of expressing a model or concept of information used in activities that require explicit details of complex systems . ”

Good navigation is the main cornerstone of an effective website .
In practice , however , it ’s often a tough challenge to come up with a meaningful , unambiguous way to organize , arrange , and display content to users ; and it ’s often not much easier to find a visually interesting solution either .
The wide adaption of JavaScript libraries like jQuery is making it increasingly easy to add various kinds of sleek animations to navigation design .
For instance , many recent promo websites are essentially single page websites with an array of animation effects used to make navigation a smoother and richer user experience .
We need to be very careful and cautious when using these dynamic effects in our designs .
A simple , calm navigation is usually much more user - friendly than an evolved , dynamic one .
Users want to use the website , not be baffled by the weird and hardly usable navigation .
But that ’s not to say that a creative navigation should be avoided at all costs .

Everyone is always looking for interesting and effective ways to organize their website and allow users to move about and find things .
But there ’s a fine line between unexpected and unusable .
Three points to consider in any navigation scheme are consistency , user expectations and contextual clues .
If page is long and provides different levels of navigation , will users be able to find their way through the site and use proper navigation quickly ?
Forcing visitors to use certain keystrokes to navigate , rather than what they ’re used to , might be novel , but is that effective if you have to explain instructions prominently on your home page ?
Here are some examples for your reading pleasure .

Go to any website and you ’re guaranteed to find one thing : a navigation menu .
Navigation menus enable visitors to move from page to page ; without them , we would have no way to conveniently explore websites .
Perhaps this is why designers , information architects , usability researchers and user experience specialists invest so much time and resources into devising aesthetically pleasing and user - friendly navigation systems .
Website navigation menus generally come in one of two orientations : vertical and horizontal .
Horizontal navigation menus display items side by side .
Vertical navigation menus stack items on top of each other .
In this post , we highlight some remarkable vertical navigation menus , for your inspiration .

The navigation menu is perhaps a website ’s single most important component .
Navigation gives you a window onto the website designer ’s creative ability to produce a functional yet visually impressive element that ’s fundamental to most websites .
Because of their value to websites , navigation menus are customarily placed in the most visible location of the page , and thus can make a significant impact on the visitor ’s first impression .
The design of a navigation menu has to be outstanding in order to sustain the user ’s interest .
As the adage goes , “ Content is king , ” but getting to the content requires navigation .
In this post , we ’ll be explore some of the more recent trends in navigation design .
We ’ll look at the aesthetics that recur in today ’s best Web designs .
The focus here is on the visual direction that leading designers are taking .

The horizontal navigation menu has become a mainstay in Web design .
It is safe to say that nowadays most websites use some form of horizontal navigation to facilitate content browsing .
The dominance of horizontal navigation over vertical ( i.e. down a sidebar ) is obviously due to the design and content limitations of the latter .
Notably , CNN discovered those limitations before switching from vertical to horizontal a few years back .
There are , however , many styles of horizontal navigation in modern Web design .
Some offer usability advantages for certain types of websites , while others are aesthetically better .
In this article , we will focus on a variety of techniques and best practices to improve the usability of horizontal navigation bars , and we will note less effective styles .
We ’ll also look at several trends that developers can choose from when working on the navigation design for their next project .

There are an extensive amount of roads you can take in web design , specifically in navigation .
Here , we will talk about one specific navigation technique , tab - based navigation .
If properly carried out , tabbed navigation can be very clean and organized within a web layout .
So what is tabbed navigation ?
Well , it is essentially a set of buttons most often set horizontally .
Tabs generally follow numerous different styling guidelines .
First , a tab set usually is attached to or slightly protrudes from a container , like in the example below .
Also , notice how the open tab matches the background color of the container , and the other buttons are darker .
This is another common styling guideline .
When you look at tabbed navigations , you will also notice many styling trends .
First , many tabs will have rounded corners on buttons .
This helps to create a clean look .
Also helping to make a clean look is the use of separation between buttons .
Most designs use space to separate buttons , but a bevel , single line , or background color contrast will also look nicely .

As a general rule , most Web developers , especially usability enthusiasts , say it is bad practice to use drop - down menus because they are confusing , annoying and oftentimes dysfunctional .
From a design standpoint , however , drop - down menus are an excellent feature because they help clean up a busy layout .
If structured correctly , drop - down menus can be a great navigation tool , while still being a usable and attractive design feature .
Yes , that ’s right : drop - down navigation menus can be user - friendly .
Just yesterday Jacob Nielsen the results of his recent drop - down menus study , in which he found out that big , two - dimensional drop - down panels that group navigation options help users to avoid scrolling and can precisely explain the user ’s choices with effective use of typography , icons , and tooltips .
In this article we take a closer look at the nature of drop - down navigation menus , analyze situations in which they should or should not be used , discuss various implementations and finally showcase a couple of bad and good examples of such menus .
The article also includes various tips and suggestions to help you work with your drop - down menus .

Navigation is the most significant element in web design .
Since web - layouts do n’t have any physical representation a user can stick to , consistent navigation menu is one of the few design elements which provide users with some sense of orientation and guide them through the site .
Users should be able to rely on it which is why designers should n’t mess around with it .
That ’s why in most cases it ’s where simple , intuitive and conventional solutions are usually the best option .
However , it does n’t mean that they need to be boring .
One year ago we ’ve presented modern approaches of navigation design .
Let ’s take a look at what ’s different now , which trends one can observe and what ideas you can develop further in your projects .
This article presents recent trends , examples and innovative solutions for design of modern navigation menus .

When users land on your website , they typically read the content available .
Then , the next thing that they will do is to try and familiarize themselves with your website .
Most of the time this involves looking for navigation .
In this article , I ’ll be analyzing the navigation elements of a particular category of websites , i.e. portfolios .
Why portfolios , you ask ?
Because they represent an interesting blend of creativity and development techniques .
As they offer an intriguing user interface and interaction , this often borderlines with what is ultimately defined as an enjoyable user experience .
Should aesthetics , originality and creativity come at the expense of usability ?
Can they reside on the same website in harmony ?

Injections of a natural growth factor into the brains of mice , rats and monkeys offers hope of preventing or reversing the earliest impacts of Alzheimer ’s disease on memory .
The benefits arose even in animals whose brains contained the hallmark plaques that clog up the brains of patients .
By delivering brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) directly into the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus , the parts of the brain where memories are formed then consolidated , the researchers successfully tackled damage exactly where Alzheimer ’s strikes first .
“ We ’re administering BDNF directly to the degenerating neurons in memory systems of the cortex , and preventing their death , ” says Mark Tuszynski of the University of California at San Diego .
The substance , which naturally supports brain cells throughout life , also amplified the numbers of connections , or synapses , between neurons .
“ Our most compelling evidence was the observation that brain cell death was prevented , and that connections between neurons rose in density by about 25 % , ” says Tuszynski .
Improvements on this scale happened in all the animals , including mice with a version of human Alzheimer ’s disease , elderly rats and monkeys with natural degeneration , plus rats and monkeys given brain lesions similar to those seen in Alzheimer’s .

To prolong the effects beyond simply injecting BDNF itself , Tuszynski injected a harmless lentivirus carrying the gene for BDNF , so that the chemical would carry on being produced by the virus .
He says that pending safety studies , trials could start in two years .
Charles Harrington of TauRx Therapeutics , a company in Aberdeen , UK , developing a drug for Alzheimer ’s called Rember , questions whether such an invasive treatment would be safe and practical .
Also , he says that if the treatment does n’t block the tau protein tangles that accumulate in neurons of Alzheimer ’s patients , the disease might advance even if cells survive and form connections to others .

Time to let Manny be Manny
Recommended Video :
It 's time for the Giants to Manny up .
This team desperately needs somebody being somebody , and nobody does that better than Manny .
If the Giants manage to land Manny Ramirez , they will make their boldest statement since 1993 , when they went all - in on a dubious diva from Pittsburgh .
Manny Ramirez is n't just the opportunity of the year , he is the opportunity of the decade , the Giants ' best hope since they passed on Vlad Guerrero in 2003 .
The situation is Code Red .
Manny must be a Giant , for four reasons .
1. Tim Lincecum changed the whole picture .
Had Lincecum not emerged , as Timmy being Timmy , the Giants ' brass could make the case that acquiring one big bat , one Manny , would not make enough of a difference to justify the huge price tag .
But Timmy is being Timmy , and suddenly the Giants have a foundation , an opportunity and an obligation .
You do n't discover Sinatra and then back him up with Those Damn Accordions .
The Giants wasted Bonds by making him go it alone for several seasons without a partner in crime .
If the Giants do that to Lincecum , they deserve every 6,000 - fan house they get at the old ballyard in the years to come .

2 . The Giants owe it to Major League Baseball to sign Ramirez , under that " best interests of baseball " clause .
Manny needs a home , and only one team in baseball is trained and qualified to handle the man .
Ramirez does n't run out a ground ball ?
Does n't actively pursue a ball in left field ?
We understand !
He 's avoiding costly " hustle " injuries and conserving precious energy for more important tasks , like trotting out three - run homers .
Ramirez seems to " quit " on his team ?
We understand !
He 's taking a mental break , checking out momentarily to save his finite store of focus .
Giants ' fans , the team itself , and the local media understand that it 's not meant for mere mortals to understand the ways of the superhero .
Just stand back and let him do his job , OK ?
If Ramirez goes to any other team , he might not be accorded the space to be his own strange self .
If that happens , shenanigans ensue and all of baseball is distracted and disrupted .
If Manny being Manny sometimes means Manny being a fanny , the Giants and their supporters can deal .
3 . The Bay Area is starved for a contender .
With the exception of the valiant Sharks , when was the last time a Bay Area pro team went into a season with a legitimate chance to do anything except hope to sneak into the back door of the playoffs ?
I do n't know either , and I 'm too discouraged to do the research .
It 's been a while .
With Ramirez , the Giants have that chance .
There is a power vacuum in the West and it wo n't be there forever .
The Dodgers have money , eventually they 'll get tired of mediocrity and they 'll spend big , and the window of opportunity will slam shut on the Giants ' fingers .
As the philosopher Robin Williams once said , " Carpe diem . "
Which is Latin for " Seize the carp . "
Even with Ramirez the Giants would have some holes , but they would have a good shot at the playoffs , and once you get to the playoffs it 's a crap shoot , with the dice favoring a team with strong starting pitching and Manny Ramirez .
4. Ramirez is expensive , but so is sucking .
I believe it was Alan Greenspan who said , " Empty seats do n't buy garlic fries . "
As we all inch closer to starvation , we get squeamish at the prospect of our local team raining crazy cash on any player , especially a player who might take a lawn chair to left field or call in sick with leprosy .
Get over it .
It 's not your money .
It 's money that belongs to people who hire people to pluck the lint off their luxury automobiles .
It 's their money and they should spend it , because they chose to own a ball team , and this is what it costs to own real players , as opposed to a gaggle of uniform - fillers .
And this is no small consideration :
It 's time to stop blaming Barry Zito .
The Giants want you to believe they can't afford to shop for a big star because Zito 's got all their money tied up ?
Preposterous .
If you 're going to take a wild gamble , which is what Zito was from the very beginning , you have to be prepared to take your hit and move on , not give up for the next five years and blame it on one struggling pitcher .
You made that mistake , Giants .
You fix it .
Let Manny be Manny in old San Franny .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Foreclosure activity in September rose 21 percent from a year earlier but fell by double - digits from the prior month as some state laws slowed the foreclosure process , according to a monthly report by research firm RealtyTrac .
Marc Charney , president of CharneyRealEstate.com , hangs a sign reading " Foreclosure For Sale " on a house in the Boston suburb of Dedham , Massachusetts , in this March 15 , 2007 file photo .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder / Files
Foreclosure filings -- default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions -- fell by 12 percent from August to 265,968 in September , according to RealtyTrac , which records property in various stages of foreclosure .
That means one in every 475 U.S. households received a foreclosure filing in September , the firm said in its report released on Thursday .
“ Much of the 12 percent decrease in September can be attributed to changes in state laws that have at least temporarily slowed down the pace at which lenders are moving forward with foreclosures , ” James Saccacio , Realty Trac chief executive , said in a statement .
Most significantly , a California law that requires lenders to make contact with borrowers at least 30 days before filing a Notice of Default ( NOD ) took effect in early September .
The state saw a drop 51 percent from the previous month , according to RealtyTrac .
That helped drive the national rate down , given that California accounts for close to a third of monthly U.S. foreclosures .
A new law in North Carolina resulted in a 66 percent drop in notices of defaults in September in that state .
However the reprieve may be short - lived .
After a Massachusetts law requiring lenders to give homeowners 90 - days to become current before initiating foreclosure proceedings took effect in May , the foreclosure rate dropped .
But three months later initial foreclosure filings jumped and were back near levels seen a year earlier , Realty Trac said .
The markets that once lead the housing boom topped the foreclosure list in September .
Nevada posted the highest foreclosure rate in September , with an 11 percent increase from the previous month , according to RealtyTrac .
Foreclosure filings rose 137 percent from a year earlier to 13,022 in September translating into one in every 82 housing units -- more than 5 times the national average .
Florida was second with one in every 178 housing units receiving a foreclosure filing in September .
Foreclosure filings rose 44 percent from a year earlier to 47,956 , according to RealtyTrac
California was third after seeing a 32 decrease from August but a 36 rise from a year earlier to 69,548 .
One in every 189 homes received a foreclosure filing in September .
Arizona , Georgia , Michigan , Ohio , New Jersey , Indiana and Colorado were among the top ten states with the highest foreclosure rate in September .
For the third quarter , U.S. foreclosure filings rose 3 percent from the prior quarter to 765,558 and were 71 percent higher than the third quarter 2007 , Realty Trac said .
Six states accounted for more than 60 percent of U.S. foreclosure activity in the third quarter .
California accounted for more than 27 percent of the nation ’s foreclosure activity , with 210,845 properties receiving a foreclosure filing during the quarter .
That ’s up 4 percent from the second quarter and more than 122 percent from the third quarter of 2007 , according to RealtyTrac .
Florida came in second with 127,306 properties in some type of foreclosure activity in the third quarter , the second highest state total .
Arizona was third with 40,419 properties receiving a foreclosure filing .
Ohio , Michigan and Nevada all reported foreclosure filings on more than 30,000 properties during the third quarter .
While Ohio and Michigan saw foreclosure activity decline from the second quarter , Nevada saw it rise 22 percent , Realty Trac said .

Memo to scientists :
If you do n't like science journalists , you 're going to like even less what you get once they 're gone .
... most of what passes for science journalism is so bad we will be better of without it .
Maybe the general public would have been more interested in science if science journalists had n't been writing so much hype about " breakthroughs " for the past twenty years .
Maybe the public would have been more interested in science if so - called " science " journalists had n't been confused about the difference between science and technology .
Science is n't about what the latest discoveries can do to make your life better .
It 's about learning how the natural world actually works .
It 's all about knowledge and not application or politics .
Science journalists have let us down .
I say good riddance .
Honestly , based upon the foregoing , I have to question whether Larry Moran knows what a science journalist is -- or at least , whether we 're talking about the same thing .
Okay , you 're thinking a guy who started a site where scientists write feature articles directly to the audience must be insane to endorse big media science journalism , right ?
Not at all .
Science journalism is a different beast than what we do here but it still has more commonality than it lacks and that 's why I was intrigued by a recent back and forth between Professor Larry Moran of the University of Toronto and Chris Mooney of Seed Media 's Scienceblogs.com .
Moran is never one to pull punches - that 's why I have him on my blogroll - but that does n't mean I always agree with him , I just like his style .
Recently he went after science journalism , which prompted a response from Chris Mooney at Scienceblogs.com and they both made some great points but this is one time where I side with science journalism .
I think some of the disagreement with Chris is due artifacts of the ' framing ' issue .
Being new in media when I first wrote about the perils of framing , I assumed I was the only one , because Scienceblogs.com is a popular blog and Chris is a good writer so I assume people like what they write - but it turns out I was n't even in the first 100 people who did n't think much of framing .
That does n't mean everything the guy writes has to be stigmatized today and in the future because of it .
I did n't think much of the blatant partisan nature of The Republican War On Science but he 's a little older now , a little wiser , and he 'll have at least 8 years to find out it is n't Republicans in a war on science , it 's all politicians .
There just happened to be a Republican in office when he started to notice .
I 'm sympathetic to his concern and after reading his stuff for the last month I think Mooney will become one of my favorites on policy issues related to science - but Prof .
Moran is not sympathetic and feels we would be just fine without science journalism at all .
A bold statement , since we 've heard various laments about layoffs at CNN and there are a lot of journalists who do n't feel like they are incompetent .
But what about his main point , that science journalists have no value ?
The one thing most scientists wish for is greater engagement and understanding of important issues by the general public .
If the only source of information is a peer - reviewed journal , that really can't happen .
And if science and scientists become marginalized , so does funding .
Mooney wonders about the impact as well .
A pretty mild statement which obviously reflects the respect that Mooney holds for Moran .
Mooney feels like science journalists are part of the solution and not part of the problem .
Moran does not agree and says , " Well Chris , I hate to tell you this but there are plenty of scientists who share my opinion , even though they may not have put it so bluntly " which is an odd logical fallacy to use for a guy who 's been doing science and critical thinking for a long time .
It does n't really matter what his friends think of science journalism any more than it mattered what Pauline Kael felt about Richard Nixon , saying he could n't have won because " No one I know voted for Nixon ! " after his landslide victory .
The crux of the issue is , is science journalism that bad ?
I'm not a journalist and I am not a scientist but I believe that if people have greater awareness about science topics , they will make more informed decisions - that 's why I created this site and bucked the trend of big media controlling who gets to write and have a wide audience .
I recognize that other media compananies have to think about other things before journalism ; that 's business reality , though I am also lucky enough to be exempt from those concerns , unlike them .
We can truly let scientists write whatever the want , without editors or size restrictions , because I trust scientists to know what they are talking about .
But I trust science journalists too and I also agree with Mooney that Moran may not be comparing apples to apples .
He lumps in ScienceDaily , for example , but they are just a press release distribution service , like Eurekalert or PRNewswire .
Why say that press releases are an example of science journalism ?
If anything , Moran should be happy about ScienceDaily because , unlike Eurekalert , they do n't charge universities like his to put science awareness in the hands of the broad public .
They do the same thing for free .
Are press releases a bad thing ?
It depends on how stupid you think your audience is .
We have discussed numerous times whether or not we should carry news releases at all but my contention has always been that our audience is smart ; they are not educated by press releases , they just want to know what is happening first .
Sometimes we make fun of press releases because they have it coming but releases written by Stanford or Yale are pretty darn good .
Without press releases , journalists would have to carry subscriptions to 1200 journals , which means only the BBC and NY Times and a few others could write about science at all .
I do n't think putting in a financial barrier like expensive subscriptions is the route to better science journalism .
With press releases , a journalist in any small publication can read about a new study , find an interesting hook , get a copy from the author and some quotes and make a story out of it .
If there are no science journalists , who will write about science ?
Well , scientists of course , and we have scientists here who do an outstanding job but they also have real jobs and we do n't pay anything so it can't happen every day .
People who get paid will produce content more consistently .
But some people will try to generate controversy too , so there will be examples of sensationalism , like New Scientist and their attempts to debunk Darwin , but that is n't a mark on science journalism overall .
And there will be some elitism .
Moran 's disdain for science journalists is evident - a few exceptions does not make a neutral arbiter of quality - but scientists can also find plenty to criticize on peer reviewed studies so it 's no surprise there either .
Outside those fringes , science writing and science journalism is pretty strong but Mooney has a point ; if journalists stop writing about science , there will be a lot less science in mainstream discussion .
Whether you agreed with Bush or not , his restrictions on stem cell research were good for science - California alone threw $ 3 billion at human embryonic stem cell ( hESC ) research for no other reason than that Bush was against it , something that could never have occurred through the NIH , and scientists also found creative alternatives , also something that would probably not have happened .
Almost as importantly , the issue mobilized people , it got biology and medicine into dinner table discussions .
Likewise you may feel like journalists were either too critical of global warming studies or not critical enough but climate science discussion has generated pageviews in the billions , something that would never have happened if journalists did not cover an obscure little committee called the IPCC .
I think the audience is smarter than Moran gives them credit for and I do n't think journalism is dying the way Mooney feels - I just think it 's been a bloated business model for a long time and there is a natural culling effect taking place .
Good science journalists will always have jobs .
Could science journalists do better by trusting the audience a little more and not dumbing it down the way corporate heads say they should ?
I think so .
Since starting this two years ago I have been amazed at how much science people know .
And equally amazed by how much of it is filtered through their political and ideological positions - and I do n't mean just Republicans , there are just as many Democrats lockstepping to the positions they are supposed to agree with .
A good source of information has value in changing minds .
Could scientists do better by trusting the audience a little more ?
I think so .
Moran said above that he believed most scientists have the disdain for journalism , and therefore the masses , that he has - I disagree .
With very few exceptions , the scientists I have asked to help clarify things or for interview questions have been eager to do so .
They want to get it right and they know journalists will do just that if they get some help .
So let 's help .
An annotated World of Warcraft interface ( see below ) .
Beware , all ye who enter World of Warcraft .
For here you will find an insanely obstructive mosaic of menus , Health bars , widgets , and chat windows .
Well , if you play it right , like we do .
This is what you 'd see without the UI overload .
As Blizzard Entertainment 's designers created it , WoW is set in a pretty , almost placid Tolkienesque universe .
But for the hardcore gamer , that pristine landscape is begging for augmentation .
There 's just too much to track :
At any given moment , a player might be expected to coordinate an upcoming event with scores of guildmates across four continents , juggle a massive inventory of items , and track online auctions , all while fighting wave after wave of evil trolls .
Here 's a look at a typical WoW desktop , with explanations for n00bs .
1 Ventrilo //
When dozens of players need to coordinate , text chat just wo n't do — voicechat app Ventrilo helps prevent anarchy .
It 's a party line for orcs and gnomes .
2 Cartographer //
The standard map in WoW is woefully inadequate .
This add - on highlights important locations , like resource - rich mining nodes .
3 Character Status //
This little display tracks your avatar 's well - being .
When the green Health bar gets low , it 's time to break out some healing potion .
4 Bartender //
These buttons represent your character 's available actions , from sorcery to swordplay .
High - level players who 've amassed scores of abilities need Bartender to keep them all straight .
5 Auctioneer Suite // Shopping for some new Leggings of Beast Mastery ?
This bot scans auction houses and ranks goods by price and availability .
6 ItemRack //
It never fails — dress in a cotton tunic and leather trousers and suddenly a wave of murlocs attacks .
Changing into armor takes forever , but ItemRack lets you switch into battle gear with a single click .
7 Combuctor //
This search function helps sift through the hundreds of outfits , keys , potions , and weapons in your inventory .
8 Group Calendar //
Just because you live in your mom's basement does n't mean you can't network like a big shot CEO .
This calendar helps guilds coordinate 40 - player , eight - hour raids .
9 Bejeweled // Worried that 30 hours a week of WoW is n't enough gaming ?
Fire up this game - within - a - game version of the addictive puzzler Bejeweled to fill in the inevitable downtime .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Ken Lewis , chairman and chief executive of Bank of America Corp. has been subpoenaed by New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , according to a report published Friday .
Cuomo is looking into whether Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % withheld information from investors in relation to its purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co. , said The Wall Street Journal .
Cuomo is investigating whether investors were misled about the depth of Merrill 's losses in late 2008 , said the Journal .
Bank of America agreed to buy Merrill in mid-September , as doubts swirled about Merrill 's viability .
Investigators also took testimony from John Thain , the former Merrill CEO , on Thursday .
The Journal said Thain was in particular quizzed on why the September agreement contained a nonpublic attachment that detailed the maximum Merrill could pay in bonuses .
The paper cites a person close to the matter , who claims that regulators are eyeing Lewis ' congressional testimony earlier this month when he said he had no authority over the bonuses .
Cuomo's team is looking into how Merrill could have set the bonuses , and told staff about them , before the end of the quarter .
They are also probing whether trading losses were adequately disclosed to shareholders and boards of Bank of America and Merrill , and what top executives who approved the bonuses knew about the losses .
While Bank of America 's acquisition of Merrill was hailed at the time the deal was announced , Merrill 's fourth - quarter losses of more than $ 15 billion , revealed the extent of the troubles that Bank of America had taken on .
It was forced to ask for billions of additional government money to help seal the deal .
The difficulties in closing the acquisitions reportedly led to tensions between Lewis and Thain , with the latter resigning in late January .
See full story .
Since
Thain 's resignation , there have been conflicting reports about how much Bank of America executives knew about Merrill 's problems , including the bonus awards , before they were publicly revealed .
It all started with mosquito nets .
Or , no , with guinea worm filters .
Or , before that , with a million yards of wool in the mountains of Sweden .
Or , taken back another generation , to uniforms for hotel and supermarket workers .
There are plenty of charitable foundations and public agencies devoted to helping the world ’s poor , many with instantly recognizable names like Unicef or the Gates Foundation .
But private companies with that as their sole focus are rare .
Even the best - known is not remotely a household name : Vestergaard - Frandsen .
Its products are in use in refugee camps and disaster areas all over the third world : PermaNet , a mosquito net impregnated with insecticide ; ZeroFly , a tent tarp that kills flies ; and the LifeStraw , a filter worn around the neck that makes filthy water safe to drink .

Two new skeptical websites have drawn a great deal of attention recently .
One is skepticblog and the other is Stop Jenny McCarthy .
Skepticblog is a new group blog by the cast and crew of the upcoming skeptical television program The Skeptologists .
It sure seems to have a lot going for it .
It has a snazzy graphic design .
It has several nationally known skeptics like Michael Shermer , Phil Plait and Steven Novella .
The first crop of articles covers such varied skeptical topics as UFO ’s , Sylvia Browne , Kevin Trudeau and one of my favorites , internet misinformation .
Stop Jenny McCarthy is a new informational site from the mold of Stop Kaz and Stop Sylvia Browne .
The idea is to focus tightly on the specific claims being made by one person , and show how and why they are incorrect .
This site is much smaller and is done in a much simpler visual style .
As of now it only has a handful of pages .
I found it interesting that these two sites were launched in the same month .
There are many skeptics who wonder how they can contribute to the movement .
Until this year , I was one of them .
I talk to others regularly at skeptic gatherings .
The internet is an excellent avenue to focus this energy .
Setting up a web site is an inexpensive and easy way you can impact a huge number of people .
Indeed , you can have a world - wide audience that you can reach 24/7 , for free plus a committment of your own time .
So , once you ’ve decided to build a web site , now what ?
In recent months I ’ve seen many skeptics go the route of skepticblog and simply set up their own skeptical blog .
They then begin writing about the whole gamut of skeptical topics .
After all , why limit yourself to one area ?
Skepticism is a wide and varied field and there is a great deal of ground to cover .
By leaving it open - ended you ensure you will never have a lack of topics .
If you are thinking of doing this yourself , I think you are making a huge mistake .
I strongly believe that we as skeptics should be looking to set up more sites like Stop Jenny McCarthy and fewer general - purpose sites or blogs .
In fact , I think we are missing the boat on many skeptical topics by not having more specialized sites .
To explain why , I have to talk about the long tail .
The Long Tail
The long tail is a concept put forward by Chris Anderson in an article in Wired Magazine in 2004 .
He noted that traditional businesses often had to focus on mass market products that have wide appeal due to the overhead costs of bringing those products to market .
On the other hand , the new breed of internet retailers like Amazon and Netflix were able to have considerable success selling much more niche products .
This is possible in part because direct internet retail has removed overhead and other costs that hampered the earlier retailers .
The long tail is a manifestation of what many of us know as the “ 80/20 rule ” ( or Pareto principle ) .
Basically it says that 80 % of the effects in complex systems are the result of only 20 % of the causes .
This rule of thumb manifests in many ways .
In retailing , it says that most of your sales and profit are going to come from those 20 % of items that everyone needs .
Conversely , the other 80 % of the products are only going to produce a marginal amount of revenue , and so deserve less of your attention .
In the movie industry , it explains why we seem to get constant barrage of blockbuster action films and fewer small niche films .
There are many other examples .
In skepticism we see this principle in the topics that skeptics tend to focus on .
Think about any general - purpose skeptical website or podcast that you follow .
Let me use my psychic powers here .
Without knowing which one you are thinking of , I will predict that at least three of the following topics were mentioned in recent articles or episodes : homeopathy , psychics , bigfoot , UFOs , acupuncture , Scientology , the “ 9/11 truth movement ” , dowsing , vaccines vs. autism and the meaning of a recent scientific study .
How did I do ?
The key point of the long tail is not that it is a problem , but rather that it represents an opportunity .
Established players in a given field are often forced to focus their efforts on the 20 % at the top for various reasons .
Newer entrants ( e.g. Amazon , Netflix ) can avoid the trouble of direct head - to - head competition with established players ( e.g. Borders , Blockbuster ) by instead focusing on the 80 % of the long tail .
We as skeptics need to learn from this .
Right now , we are duplicating much effort .
We are spending a great deal of time focusing on the 20 % of topics , and the other 80 % are hardly getting any attention at all .
We need more skeptics to focus on that long tail , those lesser known topics .
We need web sites that will fill in the long tail of skepticism .
You might disagree .
After all , homeopathy is a multi-billion dollar industry world wide .
Does it not deserve a great deal of attention ?
Sure , your article on homeopathy might be one of a thousand such skeptical articles , but is n’t it a necessary additional shot fired in a long war ?
To explain why this is a bad way to think of it , lets look at another application of the long tail .
The long tail of attention
Another area we see an 80/20 or power law pattern is in the focus of people ’s attention .
In blogs in particular , the vast majority of traffic is going to go to a very small number of sites .
Clay Shirky wrote an excellent essay about this phenomenon called Power Laws , Weblogs , and Inequality .
He points out that it is inevitable that there are going to be a handful of “ stars ” in the blogging world , and then the rest of us .
Most of us live in the long tail .
To put this very bluntly , your skeptic blog is never going to be as popular as Phil Plait’s .
Phil has got more than a decade head start on you .
To catch up , you are going to have to blog every single day for a very long time .
You will have to promote your site relentlessly using Twitter , Myspace , Facebook and so on .
You will need to attend ( and speak at ) as many skeptical events as possible .
Are you up to the task ?
Most people are n’t .
And remember that the people you are targeting to read your blog are probably going to want to read Phil ’s and Shermer ’s and Novella ’s as well .
At some point the limited amount of time in their schedule for reading blogs is going to be used up .
Can you muscle your way into that crowd ?
Mega - bloggers like Plait or Novella aside , there ’s the related problem of getting your content noticed in the first place .
The standard way to do this is through search engines like Google .
This is particularly good for reaching non-skeptical audiences who might be swayed by your brilliant arguments and data .
But take a look at what kind of hits you get for “ homeopathy ” or “ acupuncture ” or “ UFO “ .
A majority of the hits are established misinformation sites , and very few skeptical sites make it into the top results .
Do you really think you have what it takes to muscle your content up to the top of that heap ?
Are you an expert in search engine optimization ?
Now maybe you really are an expert in one of these 20 % topics like homeopathy , and you really can bring something new to the table .
If so , more power to you .
But if you are a general skeptic casting about for an idea for a site , I think you should strongly consider looking in the long tail for your niche .
Finding your niche in the long tail
Let me clarify here that I am not disagreeing here with Daniel Loxton ’s now famous essay “ Where Do We Go From Here ? ” ( PDF link ) .
I agree with him that there is plenty of material to go around for skeptics inside the classic skeptical topic areas of alternative medicine , the paranormal , cryptozoology and so on .
What I am saying is there are topics squarely in these realms which do n’t get nearly the attention that they deserve from skeptics .
And when these topics pop up periodically , either due to a mainstream news article or a person asking a question of a skeptic , the resources available within skepticism are sometimes less than adequate .
Sometimes they ’re spread out across several web sites .
Often they do n’t cover the specific detail that is being brought up .
I make it a habit to scan the General Skepticism and the Paranormal section of the JREF forum regularly .
When I see an unanswered question , I use a custom search engine to scan hundreds of skeptical websites for information on that topic .
Very often I find that that very thread on JREF is the top ranking or only mention of that topic in the skeptisphere .
Or if there is good information on the topic , its scattered across several sites and therefore not easy to present to someone you are trying to convince .
We need to fix this .
We need to make sure that there are good , focused , clear and very detailed information resources on the web for each and every topic in skepticism .
We need to fill in the tail .
So what are some of the opportunities in the long tail ?
Reorganizing existing information
In many cases the information is out there , but it is scattered across various sites or is in a format that is not as usable as it could be .
This is really all I did when I created What ’s The Harm earlier this year : gather a bunch of information that was already out there , and put it in one place .
The site has been almost universally well - received by skeptics , and I get several new links to it every week .
It is clear that people find the site useful .
And yet on some level all I did was move some information around .
I can think of several other ways skeptical information could be reorganized to provide something useful to the community :
Who ’s Who in Woo - Woo :
How about a site that simply catalogued all of the living people who are active in promoting those things that skeptics oppose , and listed their websites , latest activities , contact information and so on ?
Who are the top homeopaths working today ?
Who are the top earning psychics ?
Are there any active faith healers in Wales ?
These are useful questions that deserve good answers .
Paranormal Event Calendar :
The skepchicks maintain an excellent event calendar for skeptical events in Google Calendar .
How about a similar event calendar for paranormal , alt - medical or other events ?
These are highly interesting to skeptics who want to learn about “ the enemy ” .
These events are publicly promoted , so the information is out there .
Why not gather it one place ?
Local Skepticism :
How about collecting a catalog of all the practitioners or businesses that engage in questionable practices or sell dubious products in your own geographic area ?
This could give your local skeptic group a renewed focus on local skeptical activism .
Skeptic Wiki : Maybe you do n’t have the time or inclination to build your own site .
How about helping out with the editing of an existing site ?
Skeptic
Wiki could use your help in documenting what skepticism is all about .
Topics
There are considerable advantages to creating topic - specific sites .
Putting the topic name in the site title and the URL helps your search engine placement immensely .
Having the entire site cover one topic keeps it focused , and helps a person visiting find the information they need without getting distracted .
There are hundreds of topics in skepticism that could merit their own web sites .
Consider the thinly disguised dowsing rod called SniffEx , which James Randi often decried in his SWIFT newsletter .
You might have read about this device in SWIFT and quickly forgotten about it .
But some skeptics went to the trouble to create two different ( free ) blogspot blogs , Sniffex Questions and Sniffex Test , which document all the problems with this fraudulent device , and even show it being double - blind tested .
Because of the laser - like focus of these two sites , they rank quite highly in Google searches for Sniffex , and therefore are easily seen by anyone interested in the device , especially non-skeptics .
The nice thing about narrowly focused sites like this is that once the initial effort has been expended , they can be considered “ set and forget . ”
The information is still valid years later , even if the site has not been updated .
If Sniffex makes a resurgence , those sites are waiting to be found by potential customers .
And since they are hosted for free on a service like blogspot , they will stay out there educating the public as long as Google continues to maintain that service .
Another good example is a new site designed to skeptically analyze the TV show Paranormal State .
Television programs are widely available , but skeptical content not nearly as much .
The web is an excellent way to combat the nonsense being pushed via these programs , and a program provides a nice finite universe of topics to cover ( there are only so many episodes ) .
Why not pick one of the other shows and take it apart ?
There are hundreds of other topics that might merit a purpose - built web site to exhaustively cover the topic , where none exists already .
These include but are not limited to ear candling , gerson , hoxsey or ozone therapy , orgonomy and so on .
Just cruise around Skeptic Wiki or The Skeptic ’s Dictionary and find something that either interests you or which relates to your own personal expertise .
People
There are a large number of people who actively promote ideas or products which we skeptics oppose .
As Stop Sylvia Browne has amply shown , directly targeting the person can be an effective strategy , although it does have some potential legal pitfalls .
As long as that person is still active , there will be a need for information which counteracts their message .
We mentioned Jenny McCarthy , Sylvia Browne and Dr. Kaz deMille Jacobsen earlier .
There are also efforts underway to create sites for John Edward , Benny Hinn , Peter Popoff , and Kevin Trudeau .
But there are hundreds of other such individuals out there .
Does one of them really stick in your craw ?
Hire a lawyer , register a domain name and document where they are wrong .
Summary
There are many opportunities for skeptics to create really valuable web sites .
But do n’t fall into the trap of creating just another skeptical blog .
The biggest topics in skepticism are well covered by the “ stars ” of the skeptical movement and existing websites .
But if you look a little farther afield , there are hundreds of possible topics living out in the “ long tail ” of skepticism .
I encourage you to pick one , build a site , and be the owner of that part of the long tail .
NASA Successfully Launches Environmental Satellite
February 6th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
I ’ve always thought that we need to deal with problems here on Earth before exploring other planets , and it looks like NASA at least partially agrees with me .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA - N Prime spacecraft lifted off at 2:22 a.m. PST today aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket from NASA ’s Space Launch Complex 2 .
NOAA - N Prime will monitor environmental events around the world — including fires , crop productivity , and methane air pollution levels .
The satellite also carries an instrument to study the quantity and extent of ozone in the atmosphere , as well as a space environment monitor that measures changes in Earth ’s magnetic field .
NOAA -N is the last in a series of 16 polar - orbiting satellites launched since 1978 .
A new generation of environmental satellites , dubbed the National Polar Operational Environmental Satellite System ( NPOESS ) , will collect data and generate weather forecasts beginning in 2013 .

WASHINGTON — Congress on Friday approved a $ 787 billion economic stimulus measure , meeting the crushing mid-February deadline that Democrats had set for adopting the centerpiece of President Obama ’s early agenda but without quelling partisan divisions in Washington .
Not a single House Republican voted for the bill .
The House vote was 246 to 183 , with just 7 Democrats joining all 176 Republicans in opposition .
In the Senate , the vote , 60 to 38 , was similarly partisan .
Only 3 centrist Republicans joined 55 Democrats and 2 independents in favor .
The Senate finally adopted the bill at 10:47 p.m. after what appeared to be the longest Congressional vote in history .
The peculiar 5 - hour 17 - minute process was required because Senator Sherrod Brown , Democrat of Ohio , had to return to Washington from his home state after attending a funeral home visitation for his mother , who died Feb .

Under a procedural deal between the parties , the bill needed 60 votes to pass .
The vote began at 5:30 p.m. , but from 7:07 p.m. , when Senator Evan Bayh , Democrat of Indiana , cast his “ aye , ” the tally hung at 59 to 38 , until Mr. Brown arrived .
For a man who spent years living in caves , Osama bin Laden sure knows his Sun Tzu and the basics of jujitsu .
Sun
Tzu ’s famous dictum was “ know yourself ” and “ know your enemy . ”
Jujitsu is based upon using your enemy ’s strength against him , e.g. , like Jack in “ Jack and the Beanstalk , ” who used the giant ’s own size and anger to get him to crash from his own weight .
Bin Laden understood that the way to beat America was to turn its power back upon itself .
His early stated aim was to bankrupt America .
He knew his own weaknesses , and he profoundly understood America ’s , how its pride and fears could trigger irrational , self - destructive reactions .
The genius of bin Laden ’s pinprick attacks , costing a few hundred thousand dollars , has left America reeling with two unending multi-trillion - dollar wars it does n’t know how to get out of .
He knew that his own strength was mainly in his appeal to the minds of men , particularly to the lost dignity of Muslims trampled under the heel of their own dictators , Israel ’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza , and America ’s military .
Getting rid of the “ far ” enemy was the way to take on the “ near ” ones .
Instigating America to destroy Iraq was a triumph of genius .
He must have known about the neoconservative cabal in Washington that was itching to start wars and destroy Iraq .
In bin Laden ’s wildest dreams he then imagined that he could get an enraged America to destroy his enemies while , at the same time , isolating itself from allies and becoming seriously weakened .
His prime Arab enemy , secular nationalist socialism , was embodied by the Ba’athist rulers in Iraq .
Once destroyed , Muslim resistance could be channeled to religious fundamentalism as the only remaining force honest and profound enough to challenge Arab dictators and American soldiers successfully .
In that sense he was allied with Israel , again an intelligent strategy of harnessing his enemies ’ strength , which , for different reasons , feared Iraq as the most modern , secular nation among the Arabs far more than it feared Muslim fundamentalists .
Indeed , in Palestine , Israel built up Islamist Hamas at first as a counterforce to the secular PLO .
Successful terrorists come from the well educated , not from fundamentalist fanatics .
Next was his hope that he might get America to destroy his Shi’ite enemy , Iran .
He almost succeeded in this too .
His prime aim , though , was to get America bogged down in endless , resource - sapping wars on the Asian landmass and disrupt oil flows that benefited his enemies .
Bin Laden understood how America ’s religious fundamentalists , who had inordinate power in Washington , could be encouraged to sustain religious wars .
He “ knew ” them precisely because he understood his own Muslim fundamentalists , as indeed also the Israeli ones .
All could work together in his scheming mind to wreck the global economy , which so benefited American power .
In 2002 at a party in my home , I said to Peru ’s brilliant economist Hernando de Soto that , of course , bin Laden ’s objective was to drive America out of the Middle East .
He replied to me , “ Not just that , out of the whole Third World ! ”
The actual crash in America came about because of the wars , in several ways :
First , financing the wars with debt was the final straw that broke the camel ’s back .
No one knew how much debt would break America , but doubling the national debt from $ 5 trillion to $ 10 trillion , with new trillions being borrowed now , finally did it .
A government at war seeks political support .
Spending billions for an unpopular war and its waste makes it far more difficult to deny billions for more welfare .
That ’s why America is called a warfare - welfare state .
Welfare began in Germany in the 19th century when Bismarck sought popular support for his military ventures .
It was the trade - off .
Second , the destruction of Iraq , and Bush ’s constant threats to start bombing Iran , which could have closed down the Strait of Hormuz , brought about sky - high oil prices , which then busted world prosperity .
Still , bin Laden might not have imagined that hedge funds would feed the speculation , and that Bush would not release oil from the petroleum reserve , which could have broken the price , because he wanted to keep it in reserve for war against Iran .
Then the subsequent collapse of oil prices dried up a major source of foreign buyers for U.S. government bonds , which finance America ’s wars and reckless debts .
Third , all of Washington ’s attention was absorbed by the wars , leaving little time or energy for dull domestic issues such as debating reforms to the financial markets .
Anyone who questioned the wars ’ costs was dismissed as unpatriotic .
Lies are part of waging war , and losing discredits and exposes the leaders ’ lies .
From discredited American leaders , it was a short step to discredited American financial markets .
Fourth was the toxic alliance of neoconservatives and religious fundamentalists .
The neocons were academic Washington policy wonks who dreamed of ruling the world .
The “ fundies ” provided electoral support , because they viewed America as doing God ’s work among the foreign heathens .
Their extremists indeed wanted chaos in the Middle East to “ hurry up ” God ’s plans for Armageddon .
Instead they served bin Laden ’s goals .
Fifth , war spending deficits were in effect a massive Keynesian pump - priming operation , bound in the end to leave an economic hangover .
Wars make the economy boom with seeming prosperity , but they are actually incredible wastes of resources .
Over $ 200 million for each new fighter plane , $ 1,000 a day for mercenaries , massive corruption and incompetence in the military occupation  even bin Laden could not have anticipated how costly the war would become .
All of this was indeed foreseen by the wars ’ many critics , but they could not break through in the major media against the powers and lies of the Bush administration .
Editor John Feffer forecast the wars ’ consequences precisely in 2002 :
“ The successful realization of bin Laden ’s secret strategy will happen not with a bang but with a whimper .
Having failed to use the unipolar moment for the world ’s advantage , the United States runs the risk of following the examples of Russia and England and Turkey , all faded empires whose ambitions overreached themselves .
In the worst - case scenario , the U.S. will become the sick man of North America , a victim of military hypertrophy , extremes of wealth and poverty , decay of civil infrastructure , and loss of competitive economic advantage . ”
At least Americans are told that Washington “ succeeded ” in preventing any more attacks on the homeland .
Maybe , but the more likely reason there have been no further attacks was explained in a letter to the editor of Foreign Policy magazine [ .pdf ] by researcher Laura Garcés :
“ But one could venture that Osama bin Laden has no reason now to expose himself and expend massive resources when he accomplished exactly what he wanted : billions of dollars of expenditures in launching wars , the total neglect of infrastructure , the loss of thousands of tourists who are wary of staying in line for hours dealing with airport .
Decay and bankruptcy is what he sought , and fear is what he wanted to instill .
Can anyone doubt that he succeeded ? ”
In the summer of 2004 , Kirkuk was the last city in Iraq outside Kurdistan where foreigners could walk the streets or eat in restaurants with only moderate risk .
I went there three times and loved the place for its ancient , half - ruined streets , its variety of faces and languages , its relative tolerance and tenacity — Kirkuk is the Chicago of Iraq .
But because of its terrible history under Saddam , its oil fields , and the competing claims of its three major ethnic groups , Kirkuk also seemed destined to be the fuse that would detonate an Iraqi civil war ( I told the city ’s story in this 2004 piece ) .
I was wrong : when the civil war came , in 2005 and 2006 , it was an intra-Arab affair , between Shia and Sunni .
By then , Kirkuk had become a very violent place , with an active Al Qaeda presence , but not on the scale I and others had imagined .
Iraq ’s other civil war , the one between Arabs and Kurds , remains a low - grade fight along the fault lines where the two communities meet , from Mosul in the northwest through the heartland of Kirkuk down into Diyala province along the Iranian border .
And the main reason that this fight has n’t metastasized is that the central question of Kirkuk ’s future status — whether it will remain part of Iraq or join Kurdistan — keeps being put off .
The scheduled referendum is postponed from year to year .
Politicians and diplomats in Baghdad do n’t want another apocalypse on their hands .
But the question ca n’t be deferred indefinitely .
That a suicide bomber killed nearly fifty people in a restaurant north of Kirkuk where Arab and Kurdish leaders were meeting to discuss their differences does not come as a surprise .
It was an obvious target for anyone who wants to destroy any chance of a peaceful answer to the question of Kirkuk ’s future .
All the better that many of the victims were women and children : it will outrage both communities and set them further against each other .
In my visits to Kirkuk I met a number of people of every ethnic and religious group who were sane — who considered themselves Kirkukis before any sectarian identity , and who had n’t stopped talking to their counterparts in other groups , whatever their old and fresh resentments .
These people were weaker than the demagogues and hard - liners , but they were n’t negligible or irrelevant ; their idea of the city was a powerful one and it had an undeniable logic .
After all , even Saddam had failed to complete his ethnic cleansing of Kirkuk .
Why would anyone else be able to succeed ?
And who would want to try again ?
Because it was relatively safe to meet in public , I did a lot of my talking with these Kirkukis over enormous lunches in restaurants , where I was inevitably treated .
As the rest of Iraq became closed off to foreigners , I savored these sessions amid the chaos of waiters and dishes .
In restaurants , a certain civic trust is an implicit part of the entry fee .
You meet in a restaurant because you accept the existence and presence of others sharing the same public space , many of them strangers to you .
This recognition seemed to underlie yesterday ’s holiday feast at the restaurant called Abdullah .
As such , it was a cruelly appropriate target of the terrorists .
It will be harder for the question of Kirkuk to be answered peacefully once the Americans have left .
We ’ve always been the buffer there ; we only became the buffer everywhere else later on .
So Kirkuk might be an early test of Obama ’s withdrawal strategy and his vague promise to intervene if genocide should follow in the wake of our departure .
It ’s hard to be hopeful about Kirkuk , especially today .
I ’ve lost touch with the people I knew there ; I do n’t know whether their idea of the city still exists , or whether it can survive what happened at a restaurant yesterday .
I ’ll be honest .
The greater part of me did n’t like the budget and wanted to vote against it .
There was n’t one particular aspect , just the overall sense that we were throwing money all around but not really connecting the dots that would lead to long - term growth .
There was the need to balance what I was hearing from my local friends in the unions and anti-poverty groups with that of the London Chamber of Commerce and the City Council – both of which favored the budget .
It was 24 hours of struggle in my mind and the movement towards the eventual conclusion that I was against that kind of irresponsible spending .
And then I listened to Michael Ignatieff .
That he ’s remarkably eloquent speaks for itself , but it was actually his greater rationale that eventually brought me to the point of supporting the budget .
To be clear , I was n’t whipped into it or threatened with punishment .
It was n’t required – reason was enough .
He argued that if he brought down the government by voting down the budget , certain short - term goals would be achieved .
We would be government .
He would be Prime Minister .
We would be able to more correctly invest those kind of monies .
All of this is true .
Then he challenged us to think of a larger dynamic , one that eventually won the day .
A coalition , he offered , would be the final nail in the coffin for any hopes of national unity .
The West would want out .
Quebec would be an unknown factor .
And Canadians as a whole , excepting those constituency groups that would have been served by the coalition , would be ushered into an era of great national uncertainty again .
The markets , so requiring of stability right now , would respond with alarm and alacrity .
His arguments continued for a time yet .
I realized in an instant that he was correct , and powerfully so .
We all recalled what the threat of coalition did to the emotional state of the country back in December – remarkable division and alarm .
“ I did n’t sign on to this job to split this country , ” he stressed .
“ We are the party of national unity and we break our vow with Canadians as Liberals if we ruin our cohesiveness by grasping at immediate power . ”
This was totally absent in the rationale of Jack Layton and Gilles Duceppe – and , sad to say , in me .
Wherever we go from here , Parliament has the responsibility to hold the entire country carefully in its thoughts , actions and spending .
In his argument , Mr. Ignatieff displayed why he is qualified to lead at this level .
By refusing the crown in such a haphazard fashion , he put the country first and foremost and in the process assisted many struggling with this budget , including yours truly .
Mozilla ’s JavaScript engines have always been a bit different than those from other companies .
SpiderMonkey and its Java port , Rhino , had long contained extra features designed to make JavaScript more robust .
One such feature is the __noSuchMethod__ ( ) method that is available on native objects .
In most JavaScript engines , calling a method that does n’t exist simply results in an error ; in Mozilla engines , this is only the default behavior .
You can override that behavior by defining a __noSuchMethod__ ( ) method on the object .
This method executes whenever an undefined method is called on the object .
When called , the __noSuchMethod__ ( ) method receives two arguments : the name of the method that was called and an array of arguments that were passed to that method .
Note that the array of arguments is an instance of Array ( not an arguments object ) and is always passed even if there are no arguments .
A simple example :
//Works in Mozilla JavaScript engines only !
var person = { name : " Nicholas " , __noSuchMethod__ : function ( name , args ) { alert ( " Method called ' " + name + " ' executed with arguments [ " + args + " ] " ) ; } } //" Method called ' sayName ' executed with arguments [ ] " person.sayName ( ) ; //" Method called ' phone ' executed with arguments [ Mike ] " person. phone ( " Mike " ) ;
This code defines a variable person with a __noSuchMethod__ ( ) method defined .
When the methods sayName ( ) and phone ( ) are called on the object , the __noSuchMethod__ ( ) method is called instead , preventing an error and allowing other handling .
In this case , I ’m just displaying the name of the method and the arguments that were passed in .
Of course , normal programming practices do n’t involve methods that you ’re unaware of until runtime ; that would just be plain confusing .
This is n’t something you ’d even want to do on a regular basis .
It does , however , open up some interesting possibilities for dynamic utilities .
Consider creating an object that helps to output valid XHTML :
function HTMLWriter ( ) { this .
_work = [ ] ; } HTMLWriter .
prototype = { escape : function ( text ) { return text.replace ( /[ ><" &] /g , function ( c ) { switch ( c ) { case " > " : return " > " ; case " < " : return " < " ; case " \ " " : return " " " ; case " & " : return " & " ; } } ) ; } , startTag : function ( tagName , attributes ) { this ._work.push ( " < " + tagName ) ; if ( attributes ) { var name , value ; for ( name in attributes ) { if ( attributes.hasOwnProperty( name ) ) { value = this.escape( attributes[name ] ) ; this ._work.push ( " " + name + " =\ " " + value + " \ " " ) ; } } } this ._work.push ( " > " ) ; } , text : function ( text ) { this._work.push(this.escape( text ) ) ; } , endTag : function ( tagName ) { this ._work.push ( " <!--" + tagName + " --> " ) ; } , toString : function ( ) { return this ._work.join ( " " ) ; } } ; var writer = new HTMLWriter ( ) ; writer.startTag ( " html " ) ; writer.startTag ( " head " ) ; writer.startTag ( " title " ) ; writer .
text ( " Example & Test " ) ; writer.endTag ( " title " ) ; writer.endTag ( " head " ) ; writer.startTag ( " body " , { style : " background - color : red " } ) ; writer .
text ( " Hello world ! " ) ; writer.endTag ( " body " ) ; writer.endTag ( " html " ) ; alert ( writer ) ;
This code does the job using three methods : startTag ( ) , endTag( ) , and text ( ) .
The usage is a bit verbose .
Imagine if , instead of using startTag ( ) and endTag ( ) , there was a method for each valid XHTML tag .
Your usage might look something like this :
var writer = new HTMLWriter ( ) ; var result = writer.html ( ) .head ( ) . title ( ) . text ( " Example & Test " ) .xtitle ( ) .xhead ( ) . body ( ) .
text ( " Hell world ! " ) .xbody ( ) .xhtml ( ) .
toString ( ) ;
Since all tags behave more or less the same , you ’d be forced to create what amounts to duplicate methods on the HTMLWriter object , which is incredibly wasteful .
This is where the true power of __noSuchMethod__ ( ) comes in .
Look at how simple the code becomes for such an implementation :
function HTMLWriter ( ) { this .
_work = [ ] ; } HTMLWriter .
prototype = { escape : function ( text ) { return text.replace ( /[ ><" &] /g , function ( c ) { switch ( c ) { case " > " : return " > " ; case " < " : return " < " ; case " \ " " : return " " " ; case " & " : return " & " ; } } ) ; } , text : function ( text ) { this ._work.push(this.escape( text ) ) ; return this ; } , toString : function ( ) { return this ._work.join ( " " ) ; } , __noSuchMethod__ : function ( name , args ) { var tags = [ " a " , " abbr " , " acronym " , " address " , " applet " , " area " , " b " , " base " , " basefont " , " bdo " , " big " , " blockquote " , " body " , " br " , " button " , " caption " , " center " , " cite " , " code " , " col " , " colgroup " , " dd " , " del " , " dir " , " div " , " dfn " , " dl " , " dt " , " em " , " fieldset " , " font " , " form " , " frame " , " frameset " , " h1 " , " h2 " , " h3 " , " h4 " , " h5 " , " h6 " , " head " , " hr " , " html " , " i " , " iframe " , " img " , " input " , " ins " , " isindex " , " kbd " , " label " , " legend " , " li " , " link " , " map " , " menu " , " meta " , " noframes " , " noscript " , " object " , " ol " , " optgroup " , " option " , " p " , " param " , " pre " , " q " , " s " , " samp " , " script " , " select " , " small " , " span " , " strike " , " strong " , " style " , " sub" , " sup " , " table " , " tbody " , " td " , " textarea " , " tfoot " , " th " , " thead " , " title " , " tr " , " tt " , " u " , " ul " , " var " ] ; var closeTag = ( name.charAt ( 0 ) == " x " ) , tagName = closeTag ? name.substring ( 1 ) : name ; if ( tags.indexOf(tagName ) > - 1 ) { if ( ! closeTag ) { this ._work.push ( " < " + tagName ) ; if ( args.length ) { var attributes = args [ 0 ] , name , value ; for ( name in attributes ) { if ( attributes.hasOwnProperty( name ) ) { value = this.escape( attributes[name ] ) ; this ._work.push ( " " + name + " =\ " " + value + " \ " " ) ; } } } this ._work.push ( " > " ) ; } else { this ._work.push ( " " ) ; } return this ; } else { throw new Error ( " Method ' " + name + " ' is undefined . " ) ; } } } ;
The majority of the work in this implementation is done in __noSuchMethod__ ( ) .
It contains an array of all valid XHTML tags that is used to lookup the method that was called .
Since closing the tag requires an ‘ x ’ at the front of the method , a check is done to see if this is the first character .
If so , then the closeTag flag is set and the ‘ x ’ is stripped off of the tag name before proceeding .
Next , the Mozilla array extension indexOf ( ) is used to determine if the tag name matches the known list .
If the tag name is invalid , an error is thrown ; otherwise , normal processing occurs .
The number of supported tags is completely dynamic , and new “ methods ” can be added or removed simply by modifying the list of tags .
Clearly , this is n’t something that can be used on a regular basis as it ’s not cross - browser
It does , however , open the door for some interest possibilities if you ’re running JavaScript through a Mozilla engine either in Firefox or elsewhere .
The __noSuchMethod__ ( ) method is a powerful ally in the development of dynamic JavaScript interfaces .

A lot of us get stuck in inaction –procrastinating , doing a lot of unimportant tasks to avoid the important stuff , worrying about failing or about being perfect , having a hard time starting , getting distracted , and so on .
It ’s time to start forming the Action Habit instead .
And it ’s really not that hard if you focus on it for a little while .
Like any other habit , start in small doses , little tasks , just short bursts , and then build on that momentum .
Some quick steps for forming the Action Habit :
1. Figure out your key actions .
Focusing on the right actions is just as important as the doing .
Do n’t spend a lot of time in this step — just quickly decide your Top 3 actions for today .
2 . Pick one key action , and visualize the outcome .
How will it look when you ’re done ?
Again , do n’t spend a lot of time here — just form a quick picture in your mind .
3. Just start .
Tell yourself , “ Do it now ! ” Make it a mantra .
Do n’t mess around with tools , with distractions , with anything that will get in the way of doing this task .
Strip away everything but the task , and get going !
4. Focus on the moment .
Just be in this task , do n’t worry about the future or what mistakes you might make or might have made before .
Just focus on doing this task , as best you can .
Immerse yourself in it .
5 . Get to done .
Complete the task .
Feel good about it !
Pat yourself on the back !
Now repeat with the next task .
The more you practice this habit , the better you get .
Do it in small doses , and keep practicing .
You ’ll fail sometimes .
See the next section for how to deal with that .
But do n’t let failure stop you — just practice some more .
Barriers to the Action Habit
But what if you ’re having trouble actually taking action ?
Some quick thoughts :
Do n’t worry about perfect .
Too often we want to create the perfect plan , but while it ’s important to know where you ’re going , it ’s more important not to get stuck in the planning mode .
And while it ’s important to do your best , perfection is n’t necessary .
Stop fiddling .
Are you messing around with your software or other tools ?
Are you playing with fonts and colors and other non-essential things ?
Stop !
Get back to the task .
Remove distractions .
Turn off the phone , email , IM , Twitter , etc .
Shut off the world around you , and just focus on the doing .
Improve it later .
Just do it now .
You can make it better later .
Writers call this the sh*tty first draft — and while it sounds bad , it ’s actually a good thing .
You ’re getting it done , even if it ’s sloppy .
Break it into smaller chunks .
Sometimes the task is too intimidating .
If the task takes more than an hour , start with a 30 - minute chunk .
If that ’s too big , do just 10 minutes .
If that ’s too hard , do 5 .
If you have to , just do 1 minute , just to get going .
Stop thinking so much .
Thinking is a good thing .
Overthinking is n’t , and it gets in the way .
Put aside all the thinking ( analysis paralysis ) and just do .
If you ca n’t do something … figure out why .
Maybe you do n’t have the tools .
Maybe you do n’t have the authority .
Maybe you need something from someone else .
Maybe you ’re missing some key info .
Maybe you do n’t know how to do something and need to read up on it , or be taught how .
Maybe you just do n’t want to do it , and you should drop it altogether .
Figure out what the barrier is , and solve it .

PRESTON , England , Feb. 5 ( UPI ) -- A 24 - year - old man in Britain says a woman used a knife to carve tattoos into his flesh while he slept following a night of passion .
Wayne Robinson of Fleetwood said he never agreed to be tattooed by Dominique Fisher during their one - night stand in the town of Blackburn , The Sun reported Thursday .

" I went to her place for sex , not to be tattooed .
I look like something out of the TV show ' Prison Break . '
I can't believe she did this to me and I hate her , " Robinson said of Fisher , who was convicted in the case last week .
Robinson admitted he did n't recall receiving the slashes on his shoulder and arm , nor the star design cut into his back .
" I can't believe I did n't wake up at the time .
But to be honest I could n't even remember having sex with her , " he said .
The Sun said Fisher , who will be sentenced next month , maintained during her Preston Crown Court trial that Robinson had requested she give him the homemade tattoos .
Your spouse .
Your children .
Your doctor .
Your attorney .
These are all people that you have to trust .
I could go on : your insurance agent .
Your car repair shop .
Your babysitter .
More to the theme of this article : the web sites you use every day .
Trust is the top block on the SEO Success Pyramid , an article and image I published a year ago to outline my approach to creating long - term online success .
Trust is the primary goal of any online marketing effort .
All the other blocks in the SEO Success Pyramid , when done right , help build trust .
If there ’s one thing to learn from the SEO Success Pyramid , it ’s this :
Everything you do online should be done to increase the trust that others have in you .
“ Others , ” in this case , includes both human visitors and search engine spiders .
When you have the trust of those two audiences , you ’re perfectly positioned for long - term success .
Over the past year , I ’ve written specific articles going into more detail on most of the Pyramid ’s concepts — things like common crawlability mistakes and small business reputation management .
For this article on trust , I ’ve asked dozens of peers to help explain what trust is , why it matters in online marketing , and how you can start earning the trust of both users and search engines .
Why Trust Matters Online
Todd Malicoat : Trust is EVERYTHING to a sustainable business model .
You can make a quick buck without building trust , but it will almost always catch up to you .
Jason Falls : Consumers have flocked online in good part because they stopped trusting corporations and brands .
In addition to the 5,000 or more marketing messages per day that inundate the average American consumer , there were the Enron , New York Times plagiarism and other corporate issues in the late 1990s and early 2000s that pushed the consumer farther away from a level of trust with the average company .
In order to win that back , trust has to be centric in a brand ’s approach to its consumers online .
They ran away from them and must be wooed back .
David Temple :
It ’s easier to build trust offline because you have an office , a store , a physical manifestation of your presence .
Those signals make it easy for people to trust you .
Online you do n’t have those same signals so you have to build them .
Debra Mastaler : Your site may be functional from a usability standpoint , but if it does n’t build rapport or contain credible content , visitors and search bots will leave and place their confidence elsewhere .
Matthew Brown :
If you ’re Ford or Nabisco , you could easily build trust in your brand by spending enough money effectively through traditional advertising .
That same impact is n’t a guarantee in the online marketing world .
If you lose your trust online , whether you ’re a publisher or a brand or a notable blogger , the audience may move on before you can take action .
Martijn Beijk : Trust leads to happy customers .
Happy customers lead to returning customers .
Returning customers lead to word of mouth .
Word of mouth leads to more visitors .
Visitors turn into customers .
How Do You Earn Users ’ Trust ?
Lisa Barone :
You gain their trust by showing that you ’re a real person and not some cold , shady company hanging out on the Internet .
You gain trust by answering their questions before they even realize they have questions .
By giving them all the information they ’ll need upfront .
By explaining what information you ’re collecting , why you ’re collecting it and what you ’ll do with it when you ’re done .
By owning up to your mistakes and your faults .
By pointing customers to competitors when you can’t give them what they need .
David Wallace : Earning trust with users can be accomplished by providing good web usability and comfortable user experience , disclosing your physical location ( if applicable ) , offering guarantees and return policies , highlighting affiliations such as BBB membership or your involvement in trade associations , and featuring customer testimonies and / or reviews .
Ian Lurie : First and foremost , use common sense .
Good writing , clean design , an error - free site and an easy - to - use checkout / lead process all combine to build trust .
Second , satisfy expectations .
If your search results and advertising imply you sell grapes , sell grapes .
Do n’t lure folks in with false or shaky promises .
Third , get third - party approval .
Use Scanalert or similar services that check your site for security issues .
Then place their badge on your site .
We ’ve seen these badges improve conversion rates , and I ’ve also seen a lot of evidence they improve rankings , too .
Fourth , do n’t ask for unnecessary information .
Folks are VERY suspicious .
If all you need is their e-mail address to send them your newsletter , do n’t ask them for their phone number .
If you want them to buy from you , do n’t force them to create an account .
Any information request that customers see as unnecessary will drive them away .
Jonathan Hochman : A site has to look good , be free of errors , and be easy to use .
Whenever I visit a site and the page elements jiggle around as the page loads , or if I see typos , or if the design is unprofessional , that ’s a big turn off .
I also like to see complete contact info and some information about the ownership and principals of a business .
Also , a site should have outbound links to reliable resources , references , partners , industry associations , or other signals of quality .
Sites should not link to any sort of dodgy content .
Andy Beal :
The best way to earn trust online is to treat users the way you think they expect to be treated –then go one step beyond .
When I made my first order with Zappos — a few years ago — I had no idea if the company was trustworthy .
Not only did the company deliver as promised , but they also upgraded my delivery to overnight shipping and went beyond what they had initially promised .
That earned my trust in just one transaction !
How Do You Earn Search Engines ’ Trust ?
Aaron Wall :
Most signals of quality for search are driven to some degree by trust .
People are more likely to read your site , subscribe to your site , and link to your site if they trust you .
In an interview Bob Massa once said , “ search engines follow people . ”
If enough people care about what you are doing , then search engines will usually trust it , too .
Kim Krause Berg :
When someone claims to be a teacher or advisor , I want to know how long they ’ve been in the business , and what makes them credible .
Search engines do the same thing in their way .
How long has a domain been up and stable ?
What kinds of sites link to your site ?
These can be testimonials on your behalf .
It ’s hard to earn back search engine trust if you ’ve messed up but if you maintain trust , search engines can be very loyal .
Eric Lander : Trust will come through tried and true techniques .
Quality , valuable content is still one of the most important factors .
Beyond that , though , you are going to need authoritative and relevant inbound links in order to strengthen your trust in any particular vertical .
Dr. Michael Dorausch :
We do really well on content creation and image related traffic .
We constantly strive to see that our content is unique , made as granular as seen fit , and images are properly described , tagged , and suitable to the post .
After a decade of creating content , I ’ve learned that both forms of visitors — search engine bots and humans — appreciate and reward those efforts .
Ben Lloyd : I do n’t really make a distinction between users and search engines .
I like to think of search engines as a specific type of user and that ’s about it .
I think earning trust is combination of factors .
I think first impressions count .
Therefore , I ’d start with professional design & usability — a huge part in trust .
Content is obviously key , as well .
Useful , substantive , and informative content and features or tools helps build another layer of trust .
The next layer of credibility comes from the industry and marketplace you ’re working in — are you getting recognition from your peers ?
In SEO parlance , that typically means links .
Chris “ Silver ” Smith : Search engine trust is developed over time .
When a site delivers good content to users , those users do n’t bail out rapidly looking for info elsewhere .
A trustworthy site does n’t have a history of delivering up deceptive content , malware , and stolen content .
Trustworthiness is further enhanced in search engines ’ eyes by citations from other authoritative , trustworthy sources — a trustable site will have more inlinks and will be mentioned more in news articles , blog posts , and individual ’s email notes .
Social Media & Trust
Mack Collier :
When dealing with social media , you have to have connections built on trust in order to be successful .
Without it , you ’ve got no chance .
I think you earn trust online by being consistent , honest , and transparent in your motives and intentions .
If you say one thing and act another , that will always come through to others , and it is SO easy to spread that to other people .
Lee Odden : Marketers engaging in a social context need to earn the trust of the audiences they intend on reaching and communicating with .
Otherwise , things can turn in the other direction pretty quickly .
On the social web , there seems to be no middle ground on trust .
Either consumers trust or they do n’t .
Cameron Olthuis :
If you are not honest , you will be called out by the community .
Social media users always tend to have a couple savvy ones in the group ; if you ’re dishonest they will find out and call you out on it .
Earning a reputation for trust will increase word of mouth and business .
Earning a negative reputation for trust will result in people choosing to do business with your competitors .
Jane Copland :
Tell the truth !
This sounds too simple , but it ’s not .
Everyone screws this up sometimes , but my personal experience is that nothing beats a real voice .
This , I believe , is why companies should let their employees be themselves online ( within reason , of course ) , and also speak with a personal voice when using social media to bring across a corporate message .
Muhammad Saleem :
We ’re living in a trust - based economy .
If you want to succeed , you can no longer just blast millions of people with your message and hope that 2 % of them respond .
On the social web you have to participate and not just listen to others but show them that you ’re listening by acting on what they have to say .
Brent Csutoras :
In almost all aspects of social media , you are meant to communicate more as a friend than as someone trying to market your goods or services .
This is especially the case when talking about social communities such as Reddit , StumbleUpon , or Facebook .
A large part of social media marketing is depending on your social network to help you out and participate in your campaigns .
It is impossible to ask assistance or share something with an individual if there is no trust .
Neil Patel :
Trust is important in social media marketing because if people do n’t trust you ( the submitter ) or your website URL then your site wo n’t ever hit the homepage of any one of these sites .
Once you become trusted , it makes it much easier to become popular on the web .
Jordan Kasteler :
When it comes to social news sites , establishing trust will make or break the success of your content .
“ Content is king . ” …
No , not always .
You can have great content that you submit to a site like Reddit , Digg , or Sphinn and watch it gain little to no votes because your account is not trusted by the community .
It takes a lot of hard work and effort to be trusted by a community .
You have to be a heavy contributor , you have to support others , comment , vote , and drive your numbers up .
When someone ’s analyzing you in a social community they ’re going to be looking at your numbers to see if you are someone who is trusted by others .
Simon Heseltine :
One great way to generate trust online is to contribute , be a member of communities that are of interest to your company , and respond to topics that may not be in your direct line of business .
That way , should there ever be an issue with your company that you need to respond to , those people in those communities will be more willing to give you the benefit of the doubt , and allow you to explain your side of the story , because you ’ll have built up that level of trust with them .
Local Search & Trust
Don Campbell : More and more new people are going to Google or Yahoo to find local goods and services instead of using the print yellow pages .
When one of these users finds your website through the local search results you can build trust by having an effective website that provides all of the information they need to contact or find you , with a specific call to action like asking for a phone call or visit to your physical location .
Proactively managing your online reviews is a very important way to build trust with new customers .
Make sure you know where people are reviewing your business ( e.g. Google Local , Yahoo Local , Yelp , etc. ) , monitor and respond to those reviews , and most importantly build a habit of asking your best customers to spend five minutes to give you a review online .
And make it super easy for them to do this .
David Mihm :
Make sure you are getting positive reviews on as many different portals as you can .
If you ’re not , respond to the negative ones in a way that users who come along and read them are willing to give you a second chance .
Do great work and you earn trust from customers and clients , but you also need to make sure they ’re talking about their experiences on the web .
You can help form people ’s impressions of you even before they come to your site .
I actually see the engines moving more and more to a TrustRank metric than a PageRank metric as we go forward .
I know that component is already part of Google ’s and Yahoo ’s current algorithms , but the whole “ six degrees of separation ” from a quality website like your city government page , etc. , already seems to be having an increased impact on ranking in the 10 - pack .
Mike Blumenthal : Trust in a Google Maps sense is algorithmic in nature .
Its meaning has little to do with trust as traditionally defined in a customer merchant relationship .
Google has the problem of having millions of business listings and needing to know with some confidence that the listing is trustworthy ; i.e. , accurately represents a business location .
Unlike in web search , in local search it is the business listing itself that needs to be trusted , not the website .
The primary mechanism for Google to establish trust in the listing is having it claimed AND verified in the Local Business Center .
This establishes the listing with the highest trust level and , in theory anyway , as inviolable .
The Benefits of Trust
Michael Gray :
Once you are trusted by the search engines , you are living in the land of milk and honey .
Rankings and traffic flow more freely .
Additionally , as you become more trusted , your website plays by a different set of rules ; things like duplicate content do n’t play as much of a role .
As a publisher , the number one thing you need to focus on is getting those links and building trust if you want to rank in Google .
Todd Mintz :
If your site is n’t trusted , even the best white - hat SEO efforts wo n’t lead to optimum results .
Donna Fontenot :
The primary benefit of being trusted by search engines is that the trust often gives you a “ pass ” out of any unfortunate sticky situations you may have gotten yourself into .
“ Accidentally ” linking to a bad neighborhood ?
Oops , oh well , you ’re trusted , so you ’ll probably not get whacked too hard , if at all .
Adam Audette : Rankings !
And lots of targeted traffic .
Being a trusted resource in the eyes of the search engines means you will be crawled deeper and more often , have higher rankings , and accumulate more traffic and more backlinks .
Becoming trusted by search engines is what it ’s all about .
Stoney deGeyter : Mo ’ rankings !
Building trust in ways that can be interpreted by the search engines gives you a greater opportunity for exposure , links , and rankings .
And those things create more trust which , in turn , helps create more exposure , links , and rankings .
Susan Esparza & Virginia Nussey : Trusted sites receive authority in the link algorithm , as well as visibility benefits like Sitelinks .
Aged domains are a sign of consistency , which is a signal for trust .
Search engines want to direct users to the highest - quality sites available and to those sites that they know wo n’t hurt the user .
If the search engine knows that a certain site consistently gives users a good experience , they will trust them to continue doing so and will send more traffic that way .
Rae Hoffman : Trusted sites rank better and , in my experience , often seem to have a different set of rules , so to speak .
But the ultimate advantage is that obtaining true trust means you ’ve obtained the trust of your users and your niche , which means you ’re now building an online brand and not chasing the algorithm of the moment .
If you can do this now , while the concept is still foreign to most and the mainstream thinks it ’s “ all about links , ” you ’ll be positioned well ahead of your competitors by the time it becomes obvious .
Conclusion
It ’s all about trust .
As more of us start to feel the financial pinch , never has the idea of renting out a cluttered and rarely used spare bedroom seemed so attractive .
You can earn up to £ 4,250 tax - free under the Government ’s rent - a - room scheme which works out at around £ 350 a month – an amount that could make all the difference if finances are a bit tight .
Obviously , the better the room , the more you can charge for it .
While it is getting increasingly hard to sell properties , the rental market is booming .
If you ’re a homeowner who is n’t going anywhere for the foreseeable future , now ’s the perfect time to bide your time and make some extra money .
However , more choice for the renters means they can afford to be picky .
Therefore , it ’s worth investing a little capital to create a room that will be attractive to potential lodgers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Judy Niner set up Mondaytofriday .
com , after realising that many professionals want a base near their work during the week before returning home to their families at the weekend .
Her advice to potential landlords ?
“ First of all , the bed has to be really comfortable .
You wo n’t attract , or hang on to , lodgers if they are n’t getting a decent night ’s sleep , so invest in a decent mattress , ” she says .
“ If you need to make more than £ 400 a month in London , your lodger will need to have sole use of a bathroom .
It ’s possible to buy small en suites and if this is going to be a long - term option , it ’s worth thinking about creating another bathroom for either the lodger or your family .
“ Finally , since both students and professionals will probably want to use a computer in their room , Wi-Fi access is a must .
If you are n’t prepared to share your sitting room with your lodgers in the evenings , access to a television is also important . ”
To maximise space , consider installing a double sofabed , or a bed that is built into the wall .
The London Wallbed Company ( 020-8896 3306 ) has a good selection of beds which double up as sofas and even desks when not in use .
However , its desk / bed costs over £ 2,000 .
A cheaper alternative is its CuBed , which folds up almost flat against the wall and the underside can be painted to match the wall , or in blackboard paint to double as a noticeboard .
Prices start at £ 840 .
As Niner points out , the other basic requirement is a television .
A wall - mounted flat - screen TV wo n’t take up valuable floor space and if you have a Sky box you can upgrade to “ multiroom ” , which allows the tenant to watch what they want in their room for an extra £ 20 a month with a one - off payment of £ 49 for a second Sky box .
Otherwise , be prepared to open up your sitting room in the evenings for communal viewing .
Next up is the bathroom .
It does n’t have to be en suite but it should be for the sole use of the tenant .
If installing a private shower is too pricey , draw up a written agreement with the lodger about when the family bathroom can be used .
Ideal Standard ( 01482 346 461 ; www.ideal-standard.co.uk) has a triangular shower room .
At 1.6 m x 1.6 m , it will fit into most master bedrooms , so you can free up the family bathroom or build it into the lodger ’s room .
It costs from £ 1,900 , excluding installation and tiles , but , with a shower , basin and loo that are all designed to fit across the corners , it is probably money well spent .
The other area of contention is the kitchen .
Niner says that once again you have to decide how much of your house you are willing to share .
“ I enjoyed being able to talk to the family and live with them as a paying guest and sit with them in the evenings to watch television , ” she says .
“ But if it ’s a long - term let and you want the lodger to be more independent , then provide the basics of a kettle and toaster . ”
Buying a mini - fridge will also allow a tenant to breakfast in private .
Alternatively , invest in a tiny kitchen – or even just a microwave .
Richard Rogan , of Spacesavers ( 020-7624 1002 ; www.spacesavers. co.uk ) says : “ The rental market is very competitive and tenants have quite high standards .
For around £ 400 you can choose a range of small appliances or , for a little over £ 2,000 , you can buy a kitchen in a cupboard ( it needs to be about 1 m deep ) .
This will include a mini dishwasher , microwave and fridge .
It takes about a day to install and that price should include any extra plumbing and wiring necessary . "
Finally , keep the décor neutral and the surfaces free of clutter .
A full - time lodger might want to hang pictures on the wall and even shelves .
Someone who goes home at weekends is probably looking for more of a comfortable hotel feel and will expect bedding and towels to be provided .
After you have created the room of a lodger ’s dreams , where do you find a sympathetic , responsible character who wo n’t trash it ?
In addition to Mondaytofriday.com , which will try to net you a professional who goes away at the weekend , there are plenty of other sites which will find you a tenant ( see box ) .
If you have a full - time lodger , you can charge 40 per cent more than for a part - time resident .
Once you have found someone , visit www.tenantverify.co.uk to check their credit references , and call your home insurance company to check that you , and the tenant , are covered .
Finally , draw up a written agreement about things such as when and how loud music can be played .
When the lodgers have gone , you will be left with a fabulous guest room , and a second bathroom which has not only paid for itself but which will have added value to your property as well .

Tell Congress to Ban BPA From Baby Bottles and Other Products
by : Consumers Union
recipient : U.S. Congress
Potentially harmful chemical bisphenol - A ( BPA ) is in the blood of 93 percent of Americans aged 6 and older and enters infants through baby bottles .
Studies have shown that BPA -- which is used to make plastics such as hard , clear plastic baby bottles -- may lead to breast and prostate cancer , obesity , reproductive system abnormalities and , in infants , developmental problems .
Canada has already banned BPA from baby bottles .
The U.S. Congress should do the same , plus more : BPA is also found in items ranging from food packaging and water bottles to dental sealants .
From witnessing the effects of BPA in experiments , scientists believe this is a toxin the government cannot ignore .
Congress needs to act to eliminate this potential health threat before it 's too late .
Tell Congress to ban BPA and any other potentially harmful chemical from products that serve as gateways to our bodies .
read petition letter ▾
Please protect the health of our children by supporting legislation ( S. 2928 , HR 6228 ) to ban the use of bisphenol - A in children 's products and in food and beverage containers .
BPA is found in many hard plastic containers , including plastic baby bottles , and can leach into food and beverages and make its way into our children 's systems .
A recent study by the US Centers for Disease Control found that BPA was in the blood of 93 percent of Americans aged 6 and older .
The growing developmental systems of young children are unable to metabolize and detoxify BPA from their systems .
Recent research strongly suggests exposure may increase susceptibility to breast and prostate cancer , reproductive system abnormalities , and a host of developmental problems in the womb and early childhood .
Concerns about early life exposures also extend to early onset of puberty in females and obesity .
U.S. regulatory agencies have yet to act to protect the public , despite recent reports about BPA dangers by the National Toxicology Program and the Health Ministry of Canada , which is taking steps to ban major sources of BPA exposure .
Twelve states are moving legislation that phases out or prohibits BPA in children 's products .
In particular , due to the possible increased risks to babies , small children , and pregnant women , it makes sense at the very least to remove BPA from all products in the United States that affect these vulnerable populations .
Please help protect the health of our children by supporting S. 2928 and HR 6228 .

Packer ponders the political implications of Richard Florida 's cover story :
The landscape of the future seems more favorable to Democrats than Republicans .
And the country seems at risk of dividing into wealthier , better educated , more liberal cities , where new populations will flow , and poorer , less educated , more conservative suburbs and rural areas , where the populations will grow sparser .
This transformation might usher in a new era of liberal ascendancy , but it will bring new problems , new inequalities , new resentments .
from the Calgary Herald : Canadian mini-satellite may solve carbon puzzle ( h/t to WUWT reader “ Freezedried ” )
Tom Spears Canwestnews Service
Friday , February 27 , 2009
While NASA lost a $ 285 - million US satellite this week , a Canadian microsatellite that does the same job is chugging along happily in orbit –at 1/1,000th the cost .
The 30 - centimetre - long University of Toronto satellite is searching for the “ missing ” carbon dioxide –the vast amount of Earth ’s main greenhouse gas that somehow vanishes each year .
That ’s what NASA ’s OCO ( orbiting carbon observatory ) satellite would have done , if it had survived launch on Tuesday .
The big difference : Canada built and launched its tiny version for $ 300,000 .
The OCO launched but failed to reach orbit .
( see WUWT story here )
Details on the hardware are here
Meanwhile , the U of T’s CanX - 2 is cruising 700 kilometres above Earth “ and functioning really well , ” after some glitches that followed its launch last April , said Ben Quine , the director of space engineering at York University –which made an instrument aboard the tiny CanX .
Its job , like OCO ’s , is to find Earth ’s missing greenhouse gas .
“ The measurement principle is almost exactly the same as the one for the OCO , ” he said .
“ It ’s very sad when you lose a spacecraft , but it also means that we are the only people in orbit with one - kilometre resolution on the ground . ”
That means York ’s Argus instrument can look at details below .
A Japanese satellite does the same job , but ca n’t look at features less than 10 kilometres wide .
The problem is that where carbon dioxide comes from , and where it is sucked out of the atmosphere , remains poorly understood .
“ Clearly , if we ’re going to do something about climate change , we need to understand where CO2 is produced and particularly where it ’s absorbed .
That ’s much less clear , ” Quine said .

The New York Police Department wants to be able to shut down cell phones , in case of a terrorist attack .
During last month 's massacre in Mumbai , terrorist handlers over micromanaged via mobile phone the assaultson the hotels , train stations , and Jewish center that killed more than 170 people .
In testimony today before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs , New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly ( pictured ) said he wanted to take out that " formidable capacity to adjust tactics while attacks are underway . "
We also discussed the complications of media coverage that could disclose law enforcement tactics in real time .
This phenomenon is not new .
In the past , police were able to defeat any advantage it might give hostage takers by cutting off power to the location they were in .
However , the proliferation of handheld devices would appear to trump that solution .
When lives are at stake , law enforcement needs to find ways to disrupt cell phones and other communications in a pinpointed way against terrorists who are using them .
For now , Kelly said , the NYPD is taking a whole range of measures to stop another Mumbai - style spree – from working with private businesses to interdicting boats to training recruits in heavy weapons to installing a spycam network across downtown Manhattan .
But Charles Allen , the Department of Homeland Security 's top intelligence official , confessed to the Senate panel that " response to a similar terrorist attack in a major U.S. urban city would be complicated and difficult . "
The chaos the attacks created magnified the difficulty of mounting an appropriate response .
First responders , in order to deal with such a crisis , must first and foremost have adequate information on what is occurring as well as the capability to mount a rapid and effective response that minimizes the impact of the attack .
In Mumbai it was not immediately clear to authorities whether there were multiple attack groups or a single group .
The attackers were able to exploit the initial confusion because of the indiscriminate firings to move on to new targets .
While preparedness training for this type of attack may not have prevented it , the effects likely could have been mitigated and reduced if authorities had been prepared and had exercised responses to terrorist attacks across all levels of government .
Within the United States , our national exercises incorporate not only federal interagency participants , but also include regional , state , and local authorities , in order to identify potential gaps in our responses .

plane loads of Koreans came to the U.S. to open martial arts schools .
This was because they saw an opportunity to make money .
Again the public was lied to in many cases .
Many of the so called masters that are now famous here were low ranks in Korea .
The term Airplane Promotion was used often to describe the fact that many Koreans left Korea as low ranked black belt only to get off the plane as high ranked masters .
Many martial arts schools realized the it was very hard to keep the schools from going broke .
To combat this they used the business model used by health clubs .
This meant that they began to require contracts .
The contracts began to evolve into the black belt contracts seen often today .
NOTE : If someone can predict how long it takes to get a Black belt in advance , then you are most certainly attending the wrong school
Martial arts schools began to lower the minimum age for students to join .
NOTE : Some schools will take students as low as 3 to 4 years old under the guise of teaching principles at an early age when reality is more about revenue and structured babysitting .
Requirements were lowered because many people would drop out .
NOTE : This is especially true with Gracie Jiu-jitsu
NOTE : Taekwondo has almost twice the belt colors of traditional Japanese Jujutsu .
They also pile on stripes ( up to seven ) per belt
NOTE : Royce Gracie and family are especially notorious for this but are probably running a strong second to Fred Villari
NOTE : Fred Villari milks the soccer mom's with the leadership stuff
NOTE : Be fearful if you see the instructor with fancy colorful Gi's
While Taekwondo is the most popular martial art in America , it is also the least effective ( with the exception of shaolin kempo karate ) ...
OK , so I know folks will come out of the woodwork with my opening remarks , but it is vital to understand the difference between a sport and a martial art and no , a style can not be both !
Independent of the style and its ability to be considered a complete fighting system , many schools themselves are really McDojos in disguise .
On my side of town , I would most certainly classify Fred Villari and his chains in this category .
Others can be considered of marginal quality but suitable for the soccer mom crowd such as Avon Kempo and Aikido Anyway , here is why / how martial arts in America is starting its rapid decline into being highly ineffective ... 9 )
As the requirements for age and testing were required more belts were added to allow schools to promote more often .
10 ) More belts and more promotions allowed the schools to charge more for testing .
11 ) Some schools began to have mandatory seminars between testing , which they could charge for .
12 ) Black belt clubs became popular as another marketing method , as did leadership clubs , and competition teams .
13 ) Martial arts schools began to start allowing all kinds of uniforms and colors to sell more items .
These are just some of the problems .
Less and less real self - defense is being taught .
Now schools push the idea of having your child become a black belt .
Such other things as fitness , weight loss , and flexibility have become more important than learning real self - defense ...
Indoor plants can reduce formaldehyde levels
The toxic gas formaldehyde is contained in building materials including carpeting , curtains , plywood , and adhesives .
As it is emitted from these sources , it deteriorates the air quality , which can lead to " multiple chemical sensitivity " and " sick building syndrome " , medical conditions with symptoms such as allergies , asthma , and headaches .
The prevalence of formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds ( VOC ) is greater in new construction .
Researchers are studying the ability of plants to reduce formaldehyde levels in the air .
A study led by Kwang Jin Kim of Korea 's National Horticultural Research Institute compared the absorption rate of two types of houseplants .
The results of the experiment on Weeping Fig ( Ficus benjamina ) and Fatsia japonica , an evergreen shrub , were published in the Journal of American Society for Horticultural Science .
During the study , equal amounts of formaldehyde were pumped into containers holding each type of plant in three configurations : whole , roots - only with the leafy portion cut off , and aerial - only , with the below - ground portion sealed off , leaving the stem and leaves exposed .
The results showed the combined total of aerial - only and roots - only portions was similar to the amount removed by whole plants .
Complete plants removed approximately 80 % of the formaldehyde within 4 hours .
Control chambers pumped with the same amount of formaldehyde , but not containing any plant parts , decreased by 7.3 % during the day and 6.9 % overnight within 5 hours .
As the length of exposure increased , the amount of absorption decreased , which appeared to be due to the reduced concentration of the gas .
Aerial parts of reduced more formaldehyde during the day than at night .
This suggests the role played by stomata , tiny slits on the surface of the leaves that are only open during the day .
The portion of formaldehyde that was reduced during the night was most likely absorbed through a thin film on the plant 's surface known as the cuticle .
Root zones of ficus removed similar amounts between night and day .
However , japonica root zones removed more formaldehyde at night .
Researchers consider microorganisms living among the soil and root system to be a major contributor to the reduction .
Japonica were planted in larger pots than the ficus , which may account for the lower night reduction rate of the latter .
More knowledge of the contributions of microorganisms is cited by the study to be important in further understanding the air purifying potential of plants .

10 Downing Street is the official residence and the office of the British Prime Minister .
The office helps the Prime Minister to establish and deliver the government ’s overall strategy and policy priorities , and to communicate the government ’s policies to Parliament , the public and international audiences .
Its been a month since Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh declared that the Pakistani government “ must have ” offered some support to the Mumbai attackers … increasing tensions between the two nations and sparking fears of a war .
Now the government is taking the rhetoric to another level , as Indian Foreign Minister Shivshankar Menon declared that the organizers of the Mumbai attack “ were and remain clients and creations of the ISI . ”
The ISI , Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence agency , is the largest of several Pakistani military intelligence agencies which enjoy a large degree of autonomy , has been a favorite whipping boy of both the Indian and US governments , and is regularly accused of involvement in terrorist activity .
Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit cautioned that “ one should not jump the gun .
Some patience should be shown . ”
Pakistan received evidence from the Indian government for its ongoing investigation into the Mumbai attack , but insisted that it was “ flimsy ” and “ fabricated . ”
Mosques are places where the followers of Islam worship .

Looking at various topics that have been covered by both journalists and bloggers , I ’ve noted a common theme in which journalist deplore bloggers ’ habit of speculating about subjects instead of “ just picking up the phone ” and asking those directly involved ( examples here
Doomsday hd
and here ) .
The implied ( and sometimes expressed ) view of bloggers is that of lazy amateurs .
It struck me though , that asking questions of total strangers is both a distinctively journalistic activity and one that implies and requires a special kind of professional license .
In fact , “ Journalists do interviews ” comes much closer to a definition of what is distinctive about journalism than formulations like “ journalists report news , bloggers do opinion ” .
Starting with the professional license , it ’s generally accepted that journalists can talk to anyone they want , ask them questions and report a summary of their responses , with some selected quotes .
This is quite something , when you think about it .
If I called someone unknown to me personally who happened to be of interest for some reason , and started asking them questions on the basis that I would like to write about it , I do n’t imagine the results would be very pleasant .
The same license that allows journalists to do interviews is embodied in a whole set of formal and informal institutions including the press conference , the “ background briefing ” and the “ leak ” .
When journalists write about themselves as “ breaking news ” , what this normally involves is talking to a number of people and distilling the results into a coherent “ story ” .
The second part of this is perhaps more important than the first .
There ’s no obligation on journalists to report everything said to them ; a major part of the journalist ’s role is to select what is “ newsworthy ” and relevant to the story being told .
There ’s both a formal code of ethics and a set of informal conventions surrounding this .
The other side of this “ gatekeeping ” function is that newspapers and other media organisations are expected to cover anything that meets this definition of “ news ” ( though they are often a bit coy in cases where a rival has beaten them to the punch ) .
What this means is that journalists have to distil , from interviews , and to a deadline , a readable , and at least half - way accurate , story about a topic of which they may know little or nothing when they start .
This is a difficult skill to acquire , and something we should remember when we complain that , on any subject where we are well informed , the media stories we read or see are often wrong in at least some important detail .
By contrast , on the relatively rare occasions when bloggers and other non-journalists do interviews , the practice , almost invariably , is to publish the result verbatim .
More generally , bloggers typically do n’t claim a gatekeeping function – the norm is to quote extensively and link to what is not quoted .
On the other hand , there ’s no obligation to cover any particular topic .
This difference in approach seems to me to get much closer to the centre of things than “ journalists report news , bloggers do opinion ” .
In economics , for example , the distinction between news and analysis is largely meaningless .
The information from which journalists and bloggers work consists mainly of official statistics and statements put out by governments , companies and organizations of various kinds .
Here , for example , is the release announcing the Rudd government ’s recent stimulus package .
Bloggers typically go on from here by briefly stating , or linking the relevant facts and then providing some analysis .
Added value , beyond the analysis itself , is likely to consist of more links to relevant information or to further commentary .
By contrast , the typical straight news story would consist mainly of ( what are presented as ) quotes from government ministers , and reactions from the opposition , business and so on .
Even when simply restating the governments announcement , journalistic convention requires that it be presented in the form of a series of statements , presented as if taken down by reporters .
Press releases are routinely written to facilitate this .
Conventions like this differ a bit between media outlets and between countries .
In the US for example , it would be normal for the main story about something like the stimulus package to include an interview with a person selected somehow to represent the impact on the average person , say the owner of an insulation company .
In Australia , this kind of thing would typically be done , if at all , as a separate story .

Jane Austen was a great writer , sure , but I think we can all agree there was a severe paucity of zombies in her oeuvre .
Now , thanks to Quirk Books and author Seth Grahame - Smith , this historic injustice will finally be redressed .
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies features the original text of Jane Austen ’s beloved novel with all - new scenes of bone - crunching zombie action .
As our story opens , a mysterious plague has fallen upon the quiet English village of Meryton — and the dead are returning to life !
Feisty heroine Elizabeth Bennet is determined to wipe out the zombie menace , but she ’s soon distracted by the arrival of the haughty and arrogant Mr. Darcy .
What ensues is a delightful comedy of manners with plenty of civilized sparring between the two young lovers — and even more violent sparring on the blood - soaked battlefield as Elizabeth wages war against hordes of flesh - eating undead .
The edition will also include zombified illustrations in the style of C. E. Brock , the illustrator of Austen ’s original editions .
Yes , of course I have pre-ordered it .
And now so will you , do n’t deny it .

Carl R. Pohlad , a son of a railroad brakeman who grew up to become one of the richest men in America and the forceful owner of the Minnesota Twins , died on Monday at his home in Edina , Minn .
He was 93 .
His death was announced by his family .
Until he bought the Twins in 1984 , Mr. Pohlad had kept a low profile while building a fortune in banking , financial services , soft - drink bottling , airlines and real estate .
But the purchase thrust him into the spotlight .
At first , he was hailed as the savior of a failing franchise that was on the verge of moving to Florida .
Later , he was seen by many fans as a tightfisted villain eager to disband the team to recoup his investment .
Mr. Pohlad ’s estimated net worth of $ 3.6 billion placed him No. 102 on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans this year .
But he was already a very wealthy man when he bought the Twins from Calvin Griffith and his partners for close to $ 44 million .
At the time , it was the second - highest price ever paid for a major league franchise .
The Twins flourished after the sale , winning the World Series in 1987 against the favored St. Louis Cardinals and again in 1991 in a memorable seven - game series against the Atlanta Braves .
Mr. Pohlad received much of the credit , praised for his commitment to re-signing the star players Kirby Puckett and Kent Hrbek .

Declan Baker put the kitten in the microwave for about 10 seconds A teenager who put a four - week - old kitten in a microwave has been given 120 hours community service and banned from keeping pets for seven years .
Declan Baker , 18 , from Forfar , drunk half a bottle of whisky before cooking the young cat on 17 October last year .
A horrified friend rescued the kitten , which was convulsing and struggling to walk but it had to be put down by vets .
Animal welfare campaigners have said he should have been jailed and Baker was booed as he walked free from court .
Baker admitted the animal cruelty charges against him .
During questioning by police , he told officers that the kitten had been in the microwave for about 10 seconds .
He said it was a joke that went too far and that he regretted it .
Depute Fiscal Donna Brown told Forfar Sheriff Court : " The kitten showed signs of swollen legs and was given steroid injections to reduce inflammation .
" The next day it managed to eat and drink a little , but its body was still swollen .
It was taken home by a vet nurse over the weekend and received treatment .
But the decision was taken to put it to sleep .
" The vet said recovery would take too long and would involve too much suffering . "
This individual 's cruel and reckless behaviour clearly showed a total lack of empathy
Ross Minnett
Advocates for Animals
Defence solicitor Brian
Bell told the court that his client had received death threats and had lost his job following the offence .
Sheriff Kevin Veal said : " To put a small , defenceless animal inside a microwave oven and then activate the oven , with the injuries the animal thereafter sustained is altogether appalling and utterly unacceptable . "
However , he decided not to jail Baker , saying his sentence would be better served in the community .
He also ordered Baker to pay £ 150 compensation to cover vet 's fees .
The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals described the act as " barbaric . "
Senior inspector Mark Lumgair said : " This was a horrific act of animal cruelty , beyond any sort of reasonable understanding .
" Not only was the cat subjected to agonising torture , but it did not die from its injuries and endured pain and suffering until it could be put to sleep by a vet . "
Ross Minnett , director of Advocates for Animals , added : " We are disappointed that the sheriff failed to acknowledge the severity of this offence .
" This individual 's cruel and reckless behaviour clearly showed a total lack of empathy and disregard for the level of suffering caused to the kitten . "

Rules By Which A Great Empire May Be Reduced To A Small One

Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced to a Small One , first appeared in The Public Advertiser , September 11 , 1773 .
first appeared in 66164 Rules By Which A Great Empire May Be Reduced To A Small One Benjamin Franklin
[ Presented privately to a late Minister , when he entered upon his Administration ; and now first published . ]
An ancient Sage valued himself upon this , that tho ' he could not fiddle , he knew how to make a great City of a little one .
The Science that I , a modern Simpleton , am about to communicate is the very reverse .
I address myself to all Ministers who have the Management of extensive Dominions , which from their very Greatness are become troublesome to govern , because the Multiplicity of their Affairs leaves no Time for fiddling .
In the first Place , Gentlemen , you are to consider , that a great Empire , like a great Cake , is most easily diminished at the Edges .
Turn your Attention therefore first to your remotest Provinces ; that as you get rid of them , the next may follow in Order .
That the Possibility of this Separation may always exist , take special Care the Provinces are never incorporated with the Mother Country , that they do not enjoy the same common Rights , the same Privileges in Commerce , and that they are governed by severer Laws , all of your enacting , without allowing them any Share in the Choice of the Legislators .
By carefully making and preserving such Distinctions , you will ( to keep to my Simile of the Cake ) act like a wise Gingerbread Baker , who , to facilitate a Division , cuts his Dough half through in those Places , where , when bak'd , he would have it broken to Pieces .
These remote Provinces have perhaps been acquired , purchas'd , or conquer'd , at the sole Expence of the Settlers or their Ancestors , without the Aid of the Mother Country .
If this should happen to increase her Strength by their growing Numbers ready to join in her Wars , her Commerce by their growing Demand for her Manufactures , or her Naval Power by greater Employment for her Ships and Seamen , they may probably suppose some Merit in this , and that it entitles them to some Favour ; you are therefore to forget it all , or resent it as if they had done you Injury .
If they happen to be zealous Whigs , Friends of Liberty , nurtur 'd in Revolution Principles , remember all that to their Prejudice , and contrive to punish it : For such Principles , after a Revolution is thoroughly established , are of no more Use , they are even odious and abominable .
However peaceably your Colonies have submitted to your Government , shewn their Affection to your Interest , and patiently borne their Grievances , you are to suppose them always inclined to revolt , and treat them accordingly .
Quarter Troops among them , who by their Insolence may provoke the rising of Mobs , and by their Bullets and Bayonets suppress them .
By this Means , like the Husband who uses his Wife ill from Suspicion , you may in Time convert your Suspicions into Realities .
Remote Provinces must have Governors , and Judges , to represent the Royal Person , and execute every where the delegated Parts of his Office and Authority .
You Ministers know , that much of the Strength of Government depends on the Opinion of the People ; and much of that Opinion on the Choice of Rulers placed immediately over them .
If you send them wise and good Men for Governors , who study the Interest of the Colonists , and advance their Prosperity , they will think their King wise and good , and that he wishes the Welfare of his Subjects .
If you send them learned and upright Men for Judges , they will think him a Lover of Justice .
This may attach your Provinces more to his Government .
You are therefore to be careful who you recommend for those Offices . --
If you can find Prodigals who have ruined their Fortunes , broken Gamesters or Stock - Jobbers , these may do well as Governors ; for they will probably be rapacious , and provoke the People by their Extortions .
Wrangling Proctors and petty - fogging Lawyers too are not amiss , for they will be for ever disputing and quarrelling with their little Parliaments .
If withal they should be ignorant , wrong - headed and insolent , so much the better .
Attorneys Clerks and Newgate Solicitors will do for Chief - Justices , especially if they hold their Places during your Pleasure : --
And all will contribute to impress those ideas of your Government that are proper for a People you would wish to renounce it .
To confirm these Impressions , and strike them deeper , whenever the Injured come to the Capital with Complaints of Mal - administration , Oppression , or Injustice , punish such Suitors with long Delay , enormous Expence , and a final Judgment in Favour of the Oppressor .
This will have an admirable Effect every Way .
The Trouble of future Complaints will be prevented , and Governors and Judges will be encouraged to farther Acts of Oppression and Injustice ; and thence the People may become more disaffected , and at length desperate .
When such Governors have crammed their Coffers , and made themselves so odious to the People that they can no longer remain among them with Safety to their Persons , recall and reward them with Pensions .
You may make them Baronets too , if that respectable Order should not think fit to resent it .
All will contribute to encourage new Governors in the same Practices , and make the supreme Government detestable .
If when you are engaged in War , your Colonies should vie in liberal Aids of Men and Money against the common Enemy , upon your simple Requisition , and give far beyond their Abilities , reflect , that a Penny taken from them by your Power is more honourable to you than a Pound presented by their Benevolence .
Despise therefore their voluntary Grants , and resolve to harrass them with novel Taxes .
They will probably complain to your Parliaments that they are taxed by a Body in which they have no Representative , and that this is contrary to common Right .
They will petition for Redress .
Let the Parliaments flout their Claims , reject their Petitions , refuse even to suffer the reading of them , and treat the Petitioners with the utmost Contempt .
Nothing can have a better Effect , in producing the Alienation proposed ; for though many can forgive Injuries , none ever forgave Contempt .
In laying these Taxes , never regard the heavy Burthens those remote People already undergo , in defending their own Frontiers , supporting their own provincial Governments , making new Roads , building Bridges , Churches and other public Edifices , which in old Countries have been done to your Hands by your Ancestors , but which occasion constant Calls and Demands on the Purses of a new People .
Forget the Restraints you lay on their Trade for your own Benefit , and the Advantage a Monopoly of this Trade gives your exacting Merchants .
Think nothing of the Wealth those Merchants and your Manufacturers acquire by the Colony Commerce ; their encreased Ability thereby to pay Taxes at home ; their accumulating , in the Price of their Commodities , most of those Taxes , and so levying them from their consuming Customers :
All this , and the Employment and Support of Thousands of your Poor by the Colonists , you are intirely to forget .
But remember to make your arbitrary
Tax more grievous to your Provinces , by public Declarations importing that your Power of taxing them has no Limits , so that when you take from them without their Consent a Shilling in the Pound , you have a clear Right to the other nineteen .
This will probably weaken every Idea of Security in their Property , and convince them that under such a Government they have nothing they can call their own ; which can scarce fail of producing the happiest Consequences !
Possibly indeed some of them might still comfort themselves , and say , ` Though we have no Property , we have yet something left that is valuable ; we have constitutional Liberty both of Person and of Conscience .
This King , these Lords , and these Commons , who it seems are too remote from us to know us and feel for us , cannot take from us our Habeas Corpus Right , or our Right of Trial by a Jury of our Neighbours :
They cannot deprive us of the Exercise of our Religion , alter our ecclesiastical Constitutions , and compel us to be Papists if they please , or Mahometans . '
To annihilate this Comfort , begin by Laws to perplex their Commerce with infinite Regulations impossible to be remembered and observed ; ordain Seizures of their Property for every Failure ; take away the Trial of such Property by Jury , and give it to arbitrary Judges of your own appointing , and of the lowest Characters in the Country , whose Salaries and Emoluments are to arise out of the Duties or Condemnations , and whose Appointments are during Pleasure .
Then let there be a formal Declaration of both Houses , that Opposition to your Edicts is Treason , and that Persons suspected of Treason in the Provinces may , according to some obsolete Law , be seized and sent to the Metropolis of the Empire for Trial ; and pass an Act that those there charged with certain other Offences shall be sent away in Chains from their Friends and Country to be tried in the same Manner for Felony .
Then erect a new Court of Inquisition among them , accompanied by an armed Force , with Instructions to transport all such suspected Persons , to be ruined by the Expence if they bring over Evidences to prove their Innocence , or be found guilty and hanged if they can't afford it .
And lest the People should think you cannot possibly go any farther , pass another solemn declaratory Act , that `King , Lords , and Commons had , hath , and of Right ought to have , full Power and Authority to make Statutes of sufficient Force and Validity to bind the unrepresented Provinces IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER . '
This will include spiritual with temporal ; and taken together , must operate wonderfully to your Purpose , by convincing them , that they are at present under a Power something like that spoken of in the Scriptures , which can not only kill their Bodies , but damn their Souls to all Eternity , by compelling them , if it pleases , to worship the Devil .
To make your Taxes more odious , and more likely to procure Resistance , send from the Capital a Board of Officers to superintend the Collection , composed of the most indiscreet , ill - bred and insolent you can find .
Let these have large Salaries out of the extorted Revenue , and live in open grating Luxury upon the Sweat and Blood of the Industrious , whom they are to worry continually with groundless and expensive Prosecutions before the above - mentioned arbitrary Revenue - Judges , all at the Cost of the Party prosecuted tho ' acquitted , because the King is to pay no Costs .
--
Let these Men by your Order be exempted from all the common Taxes and Burthens of the Province , though they and their Property are protected by its Laws .
If any Revenue Officers are suspected of the least Tenderness for the People , discard them .
If others are justly complained of , protect and reward them .
If any of the Under - officers behave so as to provoke the People to drub them , promote those to better Offices :
This will encourage others to procure for themselves such profitable Drubbings , by multiplying and enlarging such Provocations , and all with work towards the End you aim at .
Another Way to make your
Tax odious , is to misapply the Produce of it .
If it was originally appropriated for the Defence of the Provinces and the better Support of Government , and the Administration of Justice where it may be necessary , then apply none of it to that Defence , but bestow it where it is not necessary , in augmented Salaries or Pensions to every Governor who has distinguished himself by his Enmity to the People , and by calumniating them to their Sovereign .
This will make them pay it more unwillingly , and be more apt to quarrel with those that collect it , and those that imposed it , who will quarrel again with them , and all shall contribute to your main Purpose of making them weary of your Government .
If the People of any Province have been accustomed to support their own Governors and Judges to Satisfaction , you are to apprehend that such Governors and Judges may be thereby influenced to treat the People kindly , and to do them Justice .
This is another Reason for applying Part of that Revenue in larger Salaries to such Governors and Judges , given , as their Commissions are , during your Pleasure only , forbidding them to take any Salaries from their Provinces ; that thus the People may no longer hope any Kindness from their Governors , or ( in Crown Cases ) any Justice from their Judges .
And as the Money thus mis-applied in one Province is extorted from all , probably all will resent the Mis-application .
If the Parliaments of your Provinces should dare to claim Rights or complain of your Administration , order them to be harass'd with repeated Dissolutions .
If the same Men are continually return'd by new Elections , adjourn their Meetings to some Country Village where they cannot be accommodated , and there keep them during Pleasure ; for this , you know , is your PREROGATIVE ; and an excellent one it is , as you may manage it , to promote Discontents among the People , diminish their Respect , and increase their Dis-affection .
Convert the brave honest Officers of your Navy into pimping Tide - waiters and Colony Officers of the Customs .
Let those who in Time of War fought gallantly in Defence of the Commerce of their Countrymen , in Peace be taught to prey upon it .
Let them learn to be corrupted by great and real Smugglers , but ( to shew their Diligence ) scour with armed Boats every Bay , Harbour , River , Creek , Cove or Nook throughout the Coast of your Colonies , stop and detain every Coaster , every Wood - boat , every Fisherman , tumble their Cargoes , and even their Ballast , inside out and upside down ; and if a Penn 'orth of Pins is found un-entered , let the Whole be seized and confiscated .
Thus shall the Trade of your Colonists suffer more from their Friends in Time of Peace , than it did from their Enemies in War .
Then let these Boats Crews land upon every Farm in their Way , rob the Orchards , steal the Pigs and Poultry , and insult the Inhabitants .
If the injured and exasperated Farmers , unable to procure other Justice , should attack the Agressors , drub them and burn their Boats , you are to call this High Treason and Rebellion , order Fleets and Armies into their Country , and threaten to carry all the Offenders three thousand Miles to be hang'd , drawn and quartered .
O! this will work admirably !
If you are told of Discontents in your Colonies , never believe that they are general , or that you have given Occasion for them ; therefore do not think of applying any Remedy , or of changing any offensive Measure .
Redress no Grievance , lest they should be encouraged to demand the Redress of some other Grievance .
Grant no Request that is just and reasonable , lest they should make another that is unreasonable .
Take all your Informations of the State of the Colonies from your Governors and Officers in Enmity with them .
Encourage and reward these Leasing - makers ; secrete their lying Accusations lest they should be confuted ; but act upon them as the clearest Evidence , and believe nothing you hear from the Friends of the People .
Suppose all their Complaints to be invented and promoted by a few factious Demagogues , whom if you could catch and hang , all would be quiet .
Catch and hang a few of them accordingly ; and the Blood of the Martyrs shall work Miracles in favour of your Purpose .
If you see rival Nations rejoicing at the Prospect of your Disunion with your Provinces , and endeavouring to promote it :
If they translate , publish and applaud all the Complaints of your discontented Colonists , at the same Time privately stimulating you to severer Measures ; let not that alarm or offend you .
Why should it ?
since you all mean the same Thing .
If any Colony should at their own Charge erect a Fortress to secure their Port against the Fleets of a foreign Enemy , get your Governor to betray that Fortress into your Hands .
Never think of paying what it cost the Country , for that would look , at least , like some Regard for Justice ; but turn it into a Citadel to awe the Inhabitants and curb their Commerce .
If they should have lodged in such Fortress the very Arms they bought and used to aid you in your Conquests , seize them all , ' twill provoke like Ingratitude added to Robbery .
One admirable Effect of these Operations will be , to discourage every other Colony from erecting such Defences , and so their and your Enemies may more easily invade them , to the great Disgrace of your Government , and of course the Furtherance of your Project .
Send Armies into their Country under Pretence of protecting the Inhabitants ; but instead of garrisoning the Forts on their Frontiers with those Troops , to prevent Incursions , demolish those Forts , and order the Troops into the Heart of the Country , that the Savages may be encouraged to attack the Frontiers , and that the Troops may be protected by the Inhabitants :
This will seem to proceed from your Ill will or your Ignorance , and contribute farther to produce and strengthen an Opinion among them , that you are no longer fit to govern them .
Lastly , Invest the General of your Army in the Provinces with great and unconstitutional Powers , and free him from the Controul of even your own Civil Governors .
Let him have Troops enow under his Command , with all the Fortresses in his Possession ; and who knows but ( like some provincial Generals in the Roman Empire , and encouraged by the universal Discontent you have produced ) he may take it into his Head to set up for himself .
If he should , and you have carefully practised these few excellent Rules of mine , take my Word for it , all the Provinces will immediately join him , and you will that Day ( if you have not done it sooner ) get rid of the Trouble of governing them , and all the Plagues attending their Commerce and Connection from thenceforth and for ever .

McCain draws just 1,000 at Tampa event RAW STORY
Published : Monday November 3 , 2008
Print This Email This Only 1,000 people showed up to see Sen. John McCain at a Tampa rally Monday -- leaving even Fox News scratching their heads .
" Kicking off the last day of the election in Tampa , Florida , John McCain was welcomed by a roughly 1,000 voters , " penned Huffington Post 's Sam Stein .
" Compare that to the 15,000 people that President Bush drew to a rally in Tampa on the eve of the 2004 election .
' What 's up with that ? ' wrote Adam Smith at the St. Petersburg Times . "
Fox News ' Carl Cameron said the event was " a little bit disturbing " for McCain 's prospects .
" Last night in Miami Sen .
McCain arrived for a midnight rally and had more than 10,000 people in Miami .
Today in Tampa , for a morning event , it 's a small crowd , only about 1,000 .
And I can tell you is it looks like it was set up with the perimeter and all for about 10 times this crowd .
In addition , you 'll note that there are no actual McCain signs here .
This is one of the events that is put on , ostensibly paid for by the Republican Party . "
And He hath seen our oppression under the wicked Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) and hath smitten its malefactors with a plague .
Yes , the TSA ’s vaunted new uniforms apparently cause " skin rashes , … runny or bloody noses , lightheadedness [ sic ] , red eyes , and swollen and cracked lips . "
Or at least that ’s what the American Federation of Government Employees ( AFGE ) claims .
It " estimate[s ] " that 200 or 300 " workers " [ sic for " stand-ins at the security theater " ] have complained of such symptoms .
The TSA unveiled screeners ’ blue shirts and gold metal badges with great foofaraw this summer .
Among their many other sins , no one at this absurd agency seems to have read Thoreau ’s warning against enterprises that require new clothes .
Too bad : their ignorance and new costumes cost us $ 12 million .
The uniforms deliberately mimicked those of cops , the better to cow passengers .
“ Our research shows that people respect individuals who wear uniforms , and do what they say , ” Prof. Brad Bushman of the University of Michigan told Time magazine .
The article added , " Psychologists who have researched the effects of official - looking uniforms and badges find that they do indeed tend to make people more compliant . …
In two studies conducted in the 1980s , Bushman found that people were much more likely to follow the orders of a person with a uniform and a badge than the direction of someone in regular clothing . "
Uniforms also affect the wearer .
Bushman " predicted " their new rags might make screeners " demand more of people …
And people can be expected to submit at least a little more readily . "
Screeners themselves admitted this : " We wanted to have , I do n’t want to say more authority , but a more professional look to upgrade our image , ” burbled one budding Napoleon at Reagan National .
Despite outcries from cops and their unions nationwide , the TSA never admitted to impersonating the police ( naturally enough , since that ’s a crime — at least for you or me ) .
Yet it not only confessed but emphasized its hopes of intimidating us .
" The new shirts and badges will convey authority to passengers and reflect the seriousness of screener ’s duties , said Elio Montenegro , a TSA spokesman . "
USA Today seconded that : " The attire aims to convey an image of authority to passengers , who have harassed , pushed and in a few instances punched screeners .
u2018 Some of our officers are n’t respected , ’ said TSA spokeswoman Ellen Howe . "
My heart bleeds .
But now the story ’s changed .
It was n’t power over us these bozos sought ; no , it was a " more professional look " and " better wear . "
Why , the TSA even listened to its employees , atypically enough , and " designed " the uniforms with their " input . "
( " Yo , Boss , " says fat LaWanda , peeling off her blue gloves .
" How ’bout you gimme a badge like them cops wear ?
Tired of these uppity passengers arguin ’ wit me ever time I take one of their damn bottles of rum , like I ’m stealin ’ or somethin ’ ‘ stead of doin ’ my job .
Hell , I ’d go thirsty otherwise on the chicken % @ # $ I make at this damn checkpoint . " )
Astoundingly , the TSA also wants us to believe screeners donned new duds for us !
Yes !
Christopher
White , yet another of the TSA ’s abundant and voluble spokesmen , rhapsodized , “ We ’re very proud of the new uniforms .
We ’ve heard a very strong reaction from passengers .
They like the look .
It looks much more professional . ”
Nor does a compliant and gullible media remind either White or us of the authoritarianism that sparked the change .
Instead it echoes
White ’s whopper : the " TSA changed uniforms last summer in an effort to make employees look more professional . "
Alas , it ’s unlikely that the plague is punishing screeners nearly as much as they deserve .
The caliber of the TSA ’s typical hire is lower than a politician ’s credibility : not only are screeners given to robbing , molesting , and even slaughtering passengers , but they whine .
A lot .
Screeners are just trying to pay the rent and feed their kids , after all ; they ca n’t understand why we object to their delaying us and rifling our belongings in pursuit of those lofty goals .
You might think runny noses would be a small price to pay given that the TSA expects American passengers to fork over their time , money , privacy , and dignity in the War on Terror , but no .
Screeners draw the line at sniffling for their country .
Meanwhile , remember who ’s encouraging these malingerers : a union , which , by definition , means an entity that matches the TSA for mendacity .
Indeed , unions are one of the reasons the TSA unconstitutionally impedes our travels , as Joseph and Susan Trento explain in Unsafe at Any Altitude : Exposing the Illusion of Aviation Security : " … [ A ] government labor union … was pressuring Democrats such as former representative Richard Gephardt to support a huge federalized workforce to replace the private screeners . "
They quote Kenneth Quinn , formerly an attorney with the FAA , who observed , " … you had a federal union that really wanted fifty - five thousand jobs , a very powerful PAC , and they are , like , 95 percent Democratic …
They saw it as a great opportunity to get a bunch more members into a federal government union . "
Ironically , recruiters are still drooling over that " bunch " : seven years after its authorization , the TSA has yet to forcibly unionize .
So the AFGE has a vested interest in magnifying any complaint screeners make .
In this case , it claims that the culprit is formaldehyde , " a chemical byproduct of the permanent - press finish applied by clothing manufacturers to prevent mildew and stains . "
The TSA and the uniforms ’ manufacturer , VF Solutions of Nashville , naturally deny that and brandish reports from an independent lab .
Which reminds me of Alexander McClure ’s story about Abraham Lincoln .
When General Ulysses Grant took too much time from killing Americans to linger over his whiskey , Lincoln supposedly told his critics to find out his brand " because I want to send a barrel of it to each one of my generals . "
Likewise , let ’s insist Leviathan dress all its minions in VF Solutions ’ uniforms .
Even if the suffering is n’t as severe as screeners and a scheming union would have us believe , there ’s still cause for rejoicing .
Catch the comments readers are appending to the story in its various iterations on the web .
Not long ago , such remarks could launch liberty ’s lovers into a tailspin of despair : most folks applauded the TSA as a fine idea whose efforts to subjugate us merited more money and power .
But unless they work for the government or are related to someone who does , Americans are wising up .
" Good work , rashes ! " cheers one at the Washington Post .
" Now [ screeners ] have at least an inkling of the discomfort and rage American citizens have to experience every time they take even a domestic flight … .
Go rashes go , be fruitful and multiply ! "
A second reader hopes the malady " make [s screeners ] almost as miserable as they make us citizens , who are presumed GUILTY by the TSA until PROVEN INNOCENT ! "
Others echo that theme .
" Pure Karma , " writes one taxpayer and " Poetic justice , " croons another .
A concerned citizen inquires , " Are the jackboots too tight as well ?
I do hope . "
Some propose a solution .
" Why do n’t they just give them brownshirts and swastika armbands ? " one wit wonders .
Another believes that " The TSA is a good place to begin saving budget money .
The program should be abandoned … " A third offers " a quick fix : Eliminate TSA .
Problem solved . "
Is a fourth referring to our taxes or Rigoberto Alpizar when he says , " Stop the bleeding .
Close Homeland Security " ?
Others are simply grateful : " Thank you VF Solutions , thank you , thank you . "
And keep up the great work !
The Best of Becky Akers
Last year a group of scientists came up with a surprising answer to a question that has occupied humanity since the dawn of time : how to influence the sex of your baby .
In the paper You are what your mother eats , published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , the scientists claimed that it 's all down to breakfast cereal .
Eat more of it , and you increase your chances of giving birth to a boy .
A highly unlikely claim , you might think , but there it was , the result of a sober statistical analysis of 740 women and their diet .
But now it seems that the team 's sensational " evidence " was a result of pure chance and due to a basic methodological error .
In a new paper , also published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , statisticians and medical experts show that the original authors most likely fell victim to a statistical pitfall that has been known to mathematicians since the nineteenth century .
The problem arises when you perform too many tests on the same data set .
To put it simply , the more questions you ask , the more likely it is that you get a strange answer to one of them .
As an example , imagine that your data set consists of the 740 women , information on their diet , and whether they give birth to a girl or a boy .
You might then ask whether eating jellybeans influences the sex of the child .
You count how many jellybean - eating mothers and how many non-jellybean - eating mothers give birth to boys and compute the percentage difference .
If that difference appears large , it 's tempting to conclude that jellybeans do influence the sex of the baby , but to be sure you ask yourself the following question : what is the probability that the large difference occurred purely by chance , and not because jellybeans influence gender ?
Using probabilistic methods , it 's possible to calculate this probability , and if it is very low , you have good evidence that the result was n't just pure chance and that jellybeans do indeed have an effect on gender .
But now imagine that you 're not just testing the effect of jellybeans , but of a whole range of different foodstuffs on the same data set .
For each individual food , a large discrepancy in boy - births between women who eat the food and women who do n't might indicate that the food influences gender , as it is highly unlikely that such a freak event would occur purely by chance .
However , the more opportunity there is for a freak event to occur , the higher the chance that it will indeed occur .
In other words , the more foods you test , the higher the chance that one of them will show a large discrepancy by chance when in reality there is no connection between that food and gender .
It 's a bit like playing dice : the more dice you throw , the higher the chance that one of them comes up with a six .
According to the new paper , written by Stanley Young , Heejung Bang and Kutluk Oktay , the authors of the original study failed to take account of the effects of multiple testing — indeed they tested a total of 132 foods in two different time periods .
Young , Bang and Oktay re-examined the data and found that with such a large number of tests , one would expect some to falsely indicate a dependence of gender on the given foodstuff .
" This paper comes across as well - intended , but it is hard to believe that women can increase the likelihood of having a baby - boy instead of a baby - girl by eating more bananas , cereal or salt , " Young , Bang and Oktay say in the paper .
" Nominal statistical significance , unadjusted for multiple testing , is often used to lend plausibility to a research finding ; with an arguably implausible result , it is essential that multiple testing be taken into account with transparent methods for claims to have any level of credibility .

Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending
In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low - income consumers , the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders .
The action , which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets — including the New York metropolitan region — will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans .
Fannie
Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring .
[ Rest of article here . ]
Origins :
In any crisis , one of the most common reactions is to ponder the question , “ How did we get into this mess ? ”
People begin to search for explanations about who was responsible for bringing about the current state of
affairs , who had the ability to head it off ( but failed to act or was thwarted ) , and who foresaw the looming danger ( but declined to speak up or was ignored ) .
With the United States currently in the throes of an economic crisis , of which one symptom was the September 2008 government takeover of the foundering Federal National Mortgage Association ( commonly known as Fannie Mae ) , a nine - year - old warning about the home mortgage underwriter ’s being vulnerable to economic problems that could require government rescue was bound to pique public interest .
On 30 September 1999 , the New York Times published an article entitled “ Fannie Mae Eases Credit to Aid Mortgage Lending ” by Steven A. Holmes .
The complete text of the article is available online , but in a nutshell the Times reported that Fannie Mae was easing its credit requirements for home mortgage loans in response to increasing pressure from a variety of groups :
Clinton administration officials who wanted Fannie Mae “ to expand mortgage loans among low and moderate income people ” ( particularly minority groups ) .
Stockholders who wanted Fannie Mae “ to maintain its phenomenal growth in profits . ”
Banks , thrift institutions and mortgage companies ( from whom Fannie Mae purchases loans ) who wanted the company to facilitate “ more loans to subprime borrowers . ”
In light of recent events , what caught the attention of most readers was a couple of paragraphs in the middle of the article cautioning about the possible consequences of Fannie Mae ’s loosening its credit requirements :
In moving , even tentatively , into this new area of lending , Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk , which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times .
But the government - subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn , prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980’s .

But the government - subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn , prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980’s .
“ From the perspective of many people , including me , this is another thrift industry growing up around us , ” said Peter Wallison a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute .
“ If they fail , the government will have to step up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry . ”
Another New York Times article that has attained a significant amount retrospective interest is an 11 September 2003 article entitled “ New Agency Proposed to Oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae ” by Stephen Labaton , which reported on the efforts of the Bush administration to create a new regulatory agency to assume oversight of those mortgage lenders :
The Bush administration today recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago .
The Bush administration today recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago .
Under the plan , disclosed at a Congressional hearing today , a new agency would be created within the Treasury Department to assume supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored companies that are the two largest players in the mortgage lending industry .
The new agency would have the authority , which now rests with Congress , to set one of the two capital - reserve requirements for the companies .
It would exercise authority over any new lines of business .
And it would determine whether the two are adequately managing the risks of their ballooning portfolios .
The plan is an acknowledgment by the administration that oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — which together have issued more than $ 1.5 trillion in outstanding debt — is broken .
A report by outside investigators in July concluded that Freddie Mac manipulated its accounting to mislead investors , and critics have said Fannie Mae does not adequately hedge against rising interest rates .
Of especial interest to current readers were the following paragraphs about Congressional resistance to the Bush administration ’s regulatory proposal :
Significant details must still be worked out before Congress can approve a bill .
Among the groups denouncing the proposal today were the National Association of Home Builders and Congressional Democrats who fear that tighter regulation of the companies could sharply reduce their commitment to financing low - income and affordable housing .

“ These two entities — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — are not facing any kind of financial crisis , ” said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts , the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee .
“ The more people exaggerate these problems , the more pressure there is on these companies , the less we will see in terms of affordable housing . ”

One of the first things computer users , who are concerned with security , learn is that multiple overwrites with ones and zeros are required in order to wipe data to the extent that it is unrecoverable by any forensic analysis tools .
According to this article on Softpedia , on which I stumbled while searching for something else , the above statement is a myth ; a busted myth actually .
Experts now claim that a single complete overwrite is enough to render the data unrecoverable .
Refering to the myth , the author of the article writes :
One of the reasons behind this idea is that the positioning of a hard disk drive ’s head is not precise enough to ensure that the data is overwritten with new information from the exact same byte .
A study , published on December 2008 , claims that tests performed on both last and older generation hard drives have shown that recovering even a single byte of data after a complete overwrite is practically impossible .
Security researchers from Heise Security , who have reviewed the paper presented at last year ’s edition of the International Conference on Information Systems Security ( ICISS ) , explain that a single byte of data can be recovered with a 56 percent probability , but only if the head is positioned precisely eight times , which in itself has a probability of occurring of only 0.97 % .
Since I was one of those who believed the statement about the multiple overwrites , I found the article very interesting .
I have n’t read the study itself though .

Blackwater has probably been used for U.S. Government narcotics trafficking operations before , but it looks like that is going to be a major component of their business going forward .
Note the phrase “ aviation support ” in the story below .
Aviation support is synonymous with narcotics trafficking .
If you read , Compromised : Clinton , Bush and the CIA , this will all make much more sense .
Also note the mention of West Africa as a venue for increased Blackwater / Xe activity .
In this context , see : Global Cocaine Trade Moves to Africa :
West Africa is an unlikely center for the international cocaine trade .
It is not a producer of the drug nor is it a consumer , as the vast majority of its people are very poor .
Yet a startling 50 tons of cocaine is transported through West Africa each year , according to the latest United Nations estimates .
The value of this illicit trade dwarfs entire economies and has the potential to corrupt the region ’s fragile states , which are just pulling out of decades of bitter civil wars .
In the past Africa has been a treasure trove looted by covetous colonialists , voracious rebels and kleptocratic rulers — over the last 300 years think slaves , ivory , gold , diamonds , tin and coltan .
Now it is a transit point and storeroom for the cocaine trade .
“ Drug money is perverting the weak economies in the region , ” says Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime .
The wholesale value in European streets of cocaine passing through West Africa is $ 2 billion , he says .
South American cartels used to transport cocaine to the big U.S. market via the Caribbean .
But dwindling American consumption , stricter control of the West Indies drugs route , growing cocaine use in Europe and weak law enforcement in West Africa have conspired to bring the drug to the region .
It is the path of least resistance .
Grown and processed in South America , the refined cocaine is transported by boat or plane across the Atlantic :
The shortest line of latitude brings the cargo straight to West Africa .
From there the cartels move the drugs onwards to Europe , along the way paying off West African officials in order to be able to operate freely .
So , we have Blackwater / Xe increasing “ aviation support ” activities in two of the hottest narcotics trafficking hubs in the world .
Coincidences , of course .
Blackwater / Xe / or whatever those crooks are calling themselves this week , are probably going to be performing the same role as Barry and the Boys did at Mena , Arkansas in the 1980s .
Running contractors and cutouts , training drug pilots , retrofitting aircraft , and actually carrying out narcotics trafficking operations .
Soup to nuts .
In other words , same shit , different decade .
Via : AP :
Blackwater Worldwide is still protecting U.S. diplomats in Iraq , but executives at the beleaguered security firm are taking their biggest step yet to put that work and the ugly reputation it earned the company behind them .
Blackwater said Friday it will no longer operate under the name that came to be known worldwide as a caustic moniker for private security , dropping the tarnished brand for a disarming and simple identity :
Xe , which is pronounced like the letter “ z . ”
It ’s a rare surrender for a company that cherished a brand name inspired by the dark - water swamps of northeastern North Carolina , one that survived another rebranding effort about a year ago , following a deadly shooting in Baghdad ’s Nisoor Square .
The decision to give it up underscores how badly the Moyock - based company ’s brand was damaged by that incident and other security work in Iraq .
“ They have established themselves as the bad guys , ” said Katy Helvenston , who sued the company following her son ’s death during a mission in Fallujah while working for Blackwater in 2004 .
“ They ’ve established such a horrible reputation .
Why else would they change their name ? ”
Blackwater acknowledged last year in an interview with the The Associated Press the damage to its reputation had persuaded the company to focus on lines of business other than private security contracting .
The issue came to a head last month , when the State Department said it would not rehire Blackwater to protect its diplomats in Iraq after its current contract with the company expires in May .
The company has one other major security contract , details of which are classified .
“ It ’s not a direct result of a loss of ( that ) contract , but certainly that is an aspect of our work that we feel we were defined by , ” said spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell .
The company is also replacing its bear paw logo with a sleeker black - and - white graphic based on letters that make up the company ’s new name .
In a note to employees , president Gary Jackson said the name change reflects the company ’s new focus , and he indicated Xe would not actively pursue new security business .
“ This company will continue to provide personnel protective services for high - threat environments when needed by the U.S. government , but its primary mission will be operating our training facilities around the world , ” Jackson said .
It has expanded other businesses such as aviation support , recently building a fleet of 76 aircraft that it has deployed to such hotspots as West Africa and Afghanistan .
The company got its start in training and continues to build up that business .
Last year , some 25,000 civilians , law enforcement and military personnel attended a Blackwater class .
The company ’s changes are n’t entirely voluntary .
The 2007 shooting in Nisoor Square involving Blackwater guards left at least a dozen Iraqi civilians dead , infuriated politicians in Baghdad and Washington , triggered congressional hearings and increased calls that the company be banned from Iraq .
Late last year , prosecutors charged five of the company ’s contractors — but not Blackwater itself — with manslaughter and weapons violations .
In January , Iraqi officials said they would not give the company a license to operate .
The State Department responded by informing Blackwater it would not renew a contract that comprises a third of the company ’s nearly $ 1 billion in annual revenue .
“ It would hurt us , ” company CEO Erik Prince said in an interview before losing the State Department deal .
“ It would not be a mortal blow , but it would hurt us . ”
Blackwater has rebranded before , introducing a new name — Blackwater Worldwide — and slight changes to its logo about a year ago .
But Friday ’s announcement cuts ties entirely with a name created in 1997 when Prince and some of his former Navy SEAL colleagues launched the company .
Xe will cover the parent brand for the two - dozen subsidiaries , and none of those subsidiaries will retain the word “ Blackwater ” in their names .
Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky , chair of the Intelligence Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and a longtime Blackwater critic , said the new name wo n’t change the fact that its actions have resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians .
“ Blackwater ’s notorious reputation will outlast its name , ” she said .
While some countries are eager to implement a " three strikes " Internet piracy law , others are slowly backing away into the dugout .
German lawmakers sat down privately with ISPs to talk about a proposed P2P policy that would take repeat filesharing offenders offline , but both sides have agreed that the policy 's methods would be at odds with the country 's privacy laws .
Specific details of the meeting between the German Department of Justice and the ISPs are unknown , but German language news site Heise Online ( badly Google - translated page ) claims that the two parties walked away agreeing that such an invasive system would run into legal trouble .
The ISPs reportedly described the meeting as " successful " and are working on a joint venture with content providers that would allow for more straightforward licensing terms along with better legal download options .
The three strikes concept , also known as " graduated response , " was first seriously entertained by France in 2007 .
The idea is that Internet users who are caught illegally downloading copyrighted files would receive a warning from their ISPs upon the first offense , a temporary account suspension upon the second offense , and have their Internet access completely revoked after the third infraction .
The idea quickly spread to the UK , with Parliament considering implementing similar legislation ( but without actual disconnections ) thanks to heavy lobbying from content owners .
And New Zealand is on track to implement a graduated response scheme ( with disconnections ) by the end of this month .
The largest ISP in Ireland has also agreed to graduated response , and various US ISPs are exploring it on a voluntary basis .
Unsurprisingly , the global music trade group IFPI has applauded these efforts , saying that " good things are beginning to come to pass " because of them .
ISPs are almost universally against having to boot paying customers without a judge 's order , as end users tend to respond vocally to such plans .
In the worst cases , the ISPs have no legal protection from either Big Content or customers if either feels the ISP is doing a shoddy job at enforcement , as exemplified by the situation in New Zealand .
Germany , however , is moving in the other direction .
In addition to the information conveyed by Heise 's sources , German blog Spreeblick ( translated page ) managed to get comments on the three strikes proposal right from the horse 's mouth : Germany 's Secretary of Justice , Brigitte Zypries .
Zypries said that she does n't believe the three strikes model is fitting for Germany , or even the rest of Europe .
She described the system as " highly problematic " because of constitutional and political considerations , and said that " once the first disconnects start to happen in France , we will be hearing the outcry all the way to Berlin . "
Everybody knows a forgetful stoner , but research suggests that low doses of marijuana could be good for memory , and even help prevent Alzheimer 's disease .
When given a compound similar to THC , the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana , rat brains displayed reduced levels of inflammation associated with Alzheimer 's disease .
The drug also stimulated the production of proteins associated with memory formation and brain cell growth .
" Everyone is aware that smoking too much marijuana impairs memory , " said Ohio State University psychologist Yannick Marchalant .
" Our work stays on the safe side — doses that we know are not going to impair memory , but improved it . "
Marchalant and fellow OSU psychologist Gary Wenk previously showed that marijuana can improve memory formation in rats .
The latest research , presented at this week 's Society for Neuroscience annual meeting , provides a detailed look at THC 's effect on the brain .
It 's far too soon to extrapolate the findings directly to people , but the researchers hope it will inform the development of targeted ( and legal ) drugs — and in the meantime , they say , there might be a role for marijuana in preventing age - related neurodegeneration .
" What we 're looking at is preventing the inflammation - induced impairment of memory that you see in normal and pathological aging , "
said Marchalant .
" We 'll try to find safe drugs that you can use 10 or
20 years beforehand . "
The compound used by the researchers is n't identical to THC , but marijuana likely produces some of the same effects , he said .
Marchalant cautioned that any benefits would n't be experienced by people whose brains have already started to deteriorate , nor those whose brains are still forming .
But for adults looking to prevent dementia , marijuana could play a role — albeit at very small doses , well below the level of psychoactivity .
" It will take the recreational use out of it , " said Marchalant , who made a rough extrapolation from rat doses to a single human puff of pot .
" It 's hard to say , no you should n't , " to someone who wants to self - medicate , said Marchalant , but he stressed that the research is still highly experimental .
" We still have a lot of work ahead to do in animals , " he said .

At the Oscars four years ago , now a sex worker Text Size : | KOLKATA :
When A R Rahman walked up to receive the golden Oscar statuette , her eyes misted over .
Preeti Mukherjee knows exactly how it feels .
Four years ago , she was on the same stage at Los Angeles��� Kodak
Theatre , where she , too , had hugged the statuette and cried tears of joy .
She hasn���t missed a single awards ceremony since .
On Monday , she woke up in the wee hours to catch the live telecast ��� before starting the day���s grind at Sonagachhi .
Preeti , who goes by the name Puja in Asia���s largest red light district , had got sucked into the sex trade just a year after her brush with the Oscars .
In 2005 , Preeti was part of the Oscar - winning documentary Born Into Brothels , directed by Zana Briski .
The child cast of nine had cheered so loud that it still rings in her ears .
And she still remembers the warmth of the hug Zana gave her as the award was announced .
� ��It seems like a fairy tale now .
I still see it in my dreams .
I get goosebumps when I remember the heart - stopping moment when the award was announced .
All of us kept screaming with joy .
Zana aunty made sure we , too , went along to collect the statuette .
My head was swimming , there were so many eyes on us , the deafening applause , so many cameras flashing ...��� Preeti recalls .
In 2002 , when not yet into her teens , Briski and Ross Kauffman chose her in the cast of nine to teach them photography and get a close - up view of their world and that of their mothers .
The film was completed in 2004 and went on to win about 20 international awards , capped by the Oscar .
When the film was nominated , the directors flew the kids to Los Angeles .
Life was happy for some time and the directors tried their best to rehabilitate the kids .
Preeti , who was in high school , and the rest got an offer to stay back in the US and study .
Some did .
She backed out .
�� �Aunty ( Zana ) gave a lot of money by cheque to my mother and asked her to release me , but she was unwilling .
I am a girl and an only child and my mother wouldn���t let go .
Call it family pressure if you will .
It ���s quite simple , really , ��� Preeti said , with a dismissive shrug and a short laugh .
�� �So , you see me here .���
Abhijit , one of the kids in the film , now studies in New York University .
Another girl goes to school there .
Preeti is in touch with both of them .
Two others are studying at Future Hope , run by a charitable trust .
One has got married while another girl , who was with an internationally funded NGO , has disappeared .
Dressed in jeans and a trendy shirt , Preeti could pass for any other collegegoer , until the whiff of smoke and alcohol in her breath hits you .
And you look at her eyes ��� beautiful , aggressive and defiant .
�� �At this age , I have a flat in Salt Lake , a laptop , costly phones and plenty of money .
What do I lack ?��� she looks you square in the eye .
�� �Zana aunty and I are in touch by email .
She was upset that I , too , had joined the trade like my mother , something she wanted to save me from .
But this trade has really paid off for me .���
A sign of her ���prosperity ��� ��� she has hired rooms in Prem Kamal , one of the most expensive Sonagachhi buildings .
Mother Rakhi lives in the opposite building .
Preeti pays for her living expenses .
Rakhi says she wanted a ���normal��� life for Preeti .
She still has a fading photo of Preeti with the Oscar statuette stuck on a wall .
��
�That is all I have left of her .., ��� she says , tears in her eyes .
There is no clear answer as to how and why Preeti became a sex worker .
Police records say she was rescued from a racket while a minor , sent to a juvenile home from where she was handed to her mother by the state child welfare committee .
Police say she���s now part of a major sex racket that involves extremely powerful people , who will never let her escape into a sunnier world .
Behind the I - care - a - damn stare , you can see a fleeting longing in her eyes ��� a longing for freedom .

Barack Obama 's cynical attempt to endear himself to the American people is so Machiavellian and calculating that he even went so far as to father two daughters who are enormously popular with the public , and who spent yesterday 's inauguration ceremony being by turns either adorable or just kind of well - adjusted and normal , as this this Huffington Post photo gallery demonstrates .
Meanwhile , the Bush twins send advice in the form of an open letter to Sasha and Malia , who must be getting tired of receiving all these letters by now .
Anyway , all in all , it 's heartwarming that children will be living in the White House for the first time in recent memory , and that its corridors will once more resound to shrieks of childlike glee not heard there since George Bush figured out how to operate the remote - control curtains in the State Dining Room .

The car of the future is almost here .
Aptera Motors has rolled out the first pre-production model of the 2e , an all - electric three - wheeled two - seater that gets the equivalent of 200 mpg and goes 100 miles on a charge .
It 's a significant milestone for the Southern California startup , which plans to put the first cars in driveways by Halloween and looks like a contender to win the $ 10 million Progressive Automotive X Prize .
" Everything is progressing nicely as we ramp up for full production of the 2e beginning in October , " says chief marketing officer Marques McCammon .
" We 're still on target to build an ultra - efficient , high - mileage vehicle without sacrificing comfort and safety , and once Californians get behind the wheel this fall , we expect to change the world of commuter transportation . "
In recent months , it has become clear that automakers big and small are focusing on electric vehicles as the next evolution of the automobile .
If Aptera manages delivering its superstreamlined cars nine months from now , the 2e will be among the first mass - market , relatively affordable ( at $ 25,000 to $ 45,000 ) EVs on the road .
And that would be a testament to the power of the $ 10 million X - Prize to spur innovation .
The 3 - year - old company funded by Google , Idealab and others is among at least 20 teams competing in the X - Prize race to build the world 's first mass production - ready vehicle that exceeds 100 mpg .
Most of the major automakers rolled into the Detroit auto show with EV concept cars , with Ford and Chrysler among the companies promising to begin putting cars with cords on the road in 2010 .
Tesla Motors has been building its all - electric Roadster for almost a year now , and Fisker Automotive says it will begin producing its $ 87,900 plug - in hybrid next fall .
But despite their advanced drivetrains , all those vehicles look like regular cars .
The 2e is like nothing else in the auto industry , which might be why it scored a cameo in Star Trek .
With its sleek , three - wheeled design , the 2e looks like something Spock might cruise around in .
A lithium - ion battery powers an electric motor that can propel the car from zero to 60 in less than 10 seconds on its way to a top speed of 90 mph .
High performance obviously is n't the 2e 's strong suit , but who cares when you 're getting the equivalent of 200 mpg ?
Making the car as slippery as possible is key to the car 's impressive efficiency .
With a coefficient of drag around 0.15 , the 2e is even more aerodynamic than the General Motors EV1 , the most aerodynamic production car ever built .
The 2e 's ultralight weight of just 1,700 pounds also contributes to its efficiency .
But do n't worry , the car 's front crumple zone , race car - like passenger safety cell and airbags will keep everyone inside safe .
Aptera says there 's enough room inside to haul around 15 bags of groceries , two sets of golf clubs or a surfboard .
Aptera will flog the pre-production model mercilessly to ensure durability and safety are up to snuff .
The 2e differs from an earlier prototype called the Typ - 1 in several significant ways .
Front - wheel drive replaces the prototype 's belt - driven rear wheel to improve weight distribution and traction , the rear - view camera was ditched in favor of mirrors , and wider doors make it easier to get in and out .
The interior is a little slicker too , with a stereo , roll - down windows and solar - assisted climate control ( check out the PV cells on the roof ) .
In other words , the 2e has evolved from a spartan runabout into a real car .
Aptera says it 's already received 4,000 deposits from potential buyers , who will receive a car that Aptera says should look pretty much like the model shown here .
" We 're getting close to finalizing our final prime - time vehicle , but there 's still a lot of work to accomplish , " company chief Paul Wilbur says .
Of course , nothing is certain in this economy , and the auto industry is taking such a beating that even Toyota is hurting , so there 's no guarantee Aptera will meet its goal .
And it 's hardly the first startup to think it can beat Detroit at its own game .
But Wilbur 's spent more than 25 years in the auto industry , doing everything from product planning and development to bean counting for the likes of Ford and Chrysler , so he 's got some idea what it takes to build a car .
" We now have to make the final refinements in the upcoming months , squeezing out every ounce of positive performance , and then we 'll have the first safe , affordable all - electric vehicle on the market , " he says .
Affordable is a relative term when you 're talkin ' EVs , and the 2e is expected to cost you something more than $ 25,000 but less than $ 45,000 .
That 's a pretty wide range , and it includes such mass - market cars as the next - gen Toyota Prius hybrid , the forthcoming Chevrolet Volt range - extended EV and the Mitsubishi i-MiEV electric city car that may or may not be coming to America .
The first models will be classed as motorcycles and available only in California , but Aptera hopes to sell it nationwide and then get to work on a new model .
" We hope to change everyday driving forever , " Wilbur says .

Even though reports from the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , and dozens of computer security experts who strongly and unanimously warn of insurmountable threats to the privacy and security of ballots cast over the Internet , the Washington State legislature is proposing --- and fast - tracking --- a bill to allow Internet voting for its military and overseas voters ( S.B.5522 in the Senate , and its identical companion H.B.1624 in the House ) .
Even though the U.S. Department of Defense canceled its Internet voting project ( SERVE ) in 2004 citing security concerns , and even though the DoD has still been unable to establish the secure and private Internet voting demonstration project that Congress mandated in 2002 , the Washington State legislature is seriously considering a bill that would authorize the Washington Secretary of State to create an Internet voting scheme and declare it secure and private --- without any oversight or review by the legislature or the people ...
Even though the U.S. Homeland Security Department spent $ 6.6 Billion in 2008 to protect the Federal network systems and in November 2008 failed to prevent an unprecedented and strategically timed attack on the Pentagon and military networks that house classified information , the Washington State legislature ’s bill would task the Secretary of State with creating a secure and private system using only " alternate funding . "
Even though the Pew Center on the States found that Washington State was one of the leading states in providing the time and the means for its military and overseas voters to vote , as required by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act ( UOCAVA ) , the Washington State legislature is proposing to use its UOCAVA voters as guinea pigs , claiming that we owe it to them .
VotersUnite believes we owe them opportunities to cast a secret ballot with the maximum assurance that their votes will be counted accurately and that their ballots wo n't be hijacked in cyberspace .
VotersUnite does not believe in using military and overseas voters as guinea pigs in a voting scheme that has already been determined by experts to be an " essentially impossible " task given the current architecture of the Internet .
VotersUnite does not believe in legislation that authorizes a project from which only the private vendor implementing the project stands to benefit .
Unfortunately , Washington is not the only state proposing to risk the votes of military and overseas voters by offering them Internet voting .
Alabama , Connecticut , Florida , and New Mexico are also considering such schemes .
Despite the well - documented warnings by computer scientists and security experts alike , voting over the Internet appears to be attracting the interest of legislatures and state election officials who see only the convenience of the Internet and are ill - informed about the severe risks to the ballots .
If hackers from foreign countries can penetrate the Pentagon and military computer networks with strategically - timed attacks , what would prevent them ( or home - grown hackers ) from destroying or changing the votes of Americans casting ballots over the Internet --- potentially impacting results of American elections ?
State decision makers need to value the actual votes of the voters --- and the ability for those voters to have confidence that their votes were accurately counted --- more than the convenience offered by unreliable , unobservable systems .
Experimentation in Washington and elsewhere in the country , using live voters during real elections , needs to stop .
Our military deserve better , and so does every citizen in our democracy .

UPDATE 3/2/09 :
The bill has been defeated .
One of the Washington state representatives said that the Appropriations Committee killed the House version when they found that the fiscal impact was significantly greater than the fiscal note reflected .
The Senate version also died in the Senate .
Treasury yields – is this THE low ?

In the chart below , please note the very simple channel in long bond futures going back to the beginning of the bull market .
Prices seem to top every 5 years and , right on schedule , they ’ve topped again .
Click here or on the chart below for a larger image .
The usual correction is in the 18 - 25 % range if it revisits the lower end of the channel .
From the top , at roughly 142 , a 25 % move would be to 106 or so , which is still a whopping 4.4 % .
I think is far too low considering a ) what actually now sits in the Treasury and b ) the sheer amount of global supply that is forthcoming .
Even in a slow economy , I think foreigners will need to be sellers .
I am finishing up my Mortgage Backed Securities program today and heading to more cash .
One more thing .
The secular bull market in stocks , in my opinion , ran from 1974 to 2000 .
Twenty - six years .
The bull market in bonds looks like it ran from 1982 - 2008 , also twenty - six years and exactly the length of time I have been at this .
With the “ blow - off ” move we just had , my guess is that the top is in , perhaps for a very long time … like a decade .
Using a Fibonacci analysis leads us to targets that are … well , nauseating and could be a 50 % retracement of the whole move .
So buyers of long bonds beware .
And if you want to refinance , and can actually find a good program , I would n’t hesitate .
That goes for individuals and corporations alike .
Why the Treasury is BUYING bonds at these levels instead of selling long Treasuries is beyond me .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. oil demand in October was 598,000 barrels per day more than previously estimated and down 833,000 bpd from a year earlier , the Energy Information Administration said on Monday .
U.S. oil demand in October was revised up by 3.14 percent from the EIA ’s early estimate of 19.045 million bpd to the agency ’s final demand number of 19.643 million bpd , and was 4.07 percent less than demand of 20.476 million bpd a year earlier .
The final numbers , in the EIA ’s monthly petroleum supply report , always differ from initial estimates in the weekly petroleum report .
The monthly report reflects information on petroleum products supplied from all U.S. energy companies , while the weekly report surveys the biggest companies that represent about 90 percent of the market .
Gasoline demand for October was revised down by 19,000 bpd , or 0.21 percent , to 8.986 million bpd , the lowest level for the month since 2002 and down 250,000 bpd from a year earlier .
U.S. highway travel in October fell 9 billion miles , or 3.5 percent , from a year earlier , despite falling gasoline prices , according to the Transportation Department .
It was the largest October decline in highway miles driven since 1971 .
Demand for distillate fuel was raised by 169,000 bpd , or 4.22 percent , to 4.173 million bpd , the weakest October level since 2005 , the EIA said .
Final jet fuel consumption was revised up by 1.96 percent , or 27,000 bpd , to 1.403 million bpd , but was still the smallest October demand since 1993 .
Residual fuel use was revised up by 155,000 bpd , or 35.47 percent , to 592,000 bpd , the lowest level for any October recorded in the EIA 's database , < here > , which dates back to 1936 .
One of the more annoying things about being a Java developer is the stigma the language developed far too early in its existence from being “ that Applet language ” .
You 'd mention Java and the first thing that popped into anyone 's head was those annoying , out - of - place and usually worthless applications that dotted websites before everyone gave up on Java and turned to Flash for their annoying out - of - place and usually worthless applications .
It was unfair1 , and I would spend far too much of my time pointing out that when you took Java out of the web browser , it was actually pretty useful .
As such I feel I owe Javascript an apology as , if only through laziness , I have been committing the same sin in its name .
When recommending JQuery to co-workers , friends , random passers - by and the occasional hobo ( as I have been wont to do recently ) I have tended to summarize its merit as “ it makes Javascript not suck . ”
Which is rubbish .
Javascript has always been perfectly cromulent .
What JQuery does is make the DOM API not suck .
The Document Object Model is a platform - and language - neutral interface that will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content , structure and style of documents .
The document can be further processed and the results of that processing can be incorporated back into the presented page .
— W3C
The fatal words here are “ language - neutral ” .
And the particular definition of language - neutral that the W3C uses here is “ Java and Javascript ” .
The W3C only defines normative bindings for Java and ECMAScript , however we also reference known non-W3C DOM Bindings for languages other than Java or ECMAScript . — ibid .
This is a problem .
Java is a strongly and statically typed language with a Smalltalk - style object model .
Javascript is a loosely and dynamically typed language with a prototype - based object model .
Force them to share an apartment and you 've got an instant sitcom .
Try to write an API common to both languages and you 'll end up having to pick the lowest common denominator .
Which is why DOM manipulation looks like a Java API .
Java developers , bless our hearts , are used to the kind of API that requires five lines of code just to populate an array .
What JQuery and its ilk do is provide a way of manipulating the DOM that is idiomatic Javascript rather than a strange transplant from another language .
I guess the fact that there is starting to be such a thing as idiomatic Javascript demonstrates if not a maturity of the language , then at least a promising late - adolescence .
1 Java has since accrued more deserved stigmas , but that is a story for another day .
Fissures are suddenly forming along the edges of the giant iceberg of America ’s multibillion - dollar “ war ” on drug use , first formally proclaimed by President Richard Nixon in 1971 .
But so much depends on what President Barack Obama decides to do with the issue .
This month a Latin American commission headed by former Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil , Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico and Cesar Gaviria of Colombia condemned harsh U.S. drug prohibition policies that are based , in Gaviria ’s words , “ on prejudices and fears and not on results . ”
Fueled by Americans ’ drug appetite and dollars , drug - gang violence is engulfing Mexico , threatening the very stability of the state with massive corruption and close to 6,000 killings last year .
Brazil is afflicted with daily gun battles between police and gangs in urban slums .
And despite years of intensive U.S. - backed efforts to eradicate Colombia ’s cocaine exports , official reports show they ’ve risen 15 percent in this decade .
A high proportion are smuggled into the U.S .
The drug war , the former presidents charge , is imperiling Latin America ’s democratic institutions and corrupting “ judicial systems , governments , the political system and especially the police forces . ”
As both the world ’s largest drug consumer market and the lead voice in setting global drug policy , the United States , the Latin leaders argue , has huge responsibility now to “ break the taboo ” that ’s suffocated open debate about the wisdom of a clearly failed 38 - year “ war . ”
The leaders are placing hopes in Obama , who as a candidate said the “ war on drugs is an utter failure ” and talked favorably about more public health - based approaches .
Given that history , and given this president ’s openness to hearing diverse points of view , it ’s hard to believe he ’ll maintain the stony wall of indifference to drug policy reform that all his predecessors since Nixon have maintained .
Still , there are crucial issues of politics and timing .
One can just imagine White House advisers telling Obama to steer clear of the drug issue , that it could be as perilous and distracting as gays in the military were for President Bill Clinton in his first year in office .
Against that background , the Latin leaders ’ statement itself may help move the compass .
Ethan Nadelmann , executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance , calls their manifesto ( www.drugsanddemocracy.org) “ a major leap forward in the global drug policy debate . ”
One reason : these are conservative , highly respected leaders .
Gaviria , as president of Colombia in the early ’90s , for example , worked with U.S. anti-narcotics agents to hunt down and kill Pablo Escobar , the cocaine kingpin .
But Gaviria and his fellow former presidents , along with Latin mayors , writers and other respected leaders joining in their declaration , say it ’s time to recognize that force and prohibition have failed to stop dangerous narco - trafficking .
It ’s high time , they propose , to focus on harm reduction and prevention efforts — following European models to change the status of addicts from drug buyers in an illegal system to that of patients cared for in a public health system .
They also suggest considering decriminalizing possession of marijuana for personal use — a step Obama recently indicated he ’s not ready to take .
And they say they ’ll be watching how the U.S. handles the meeting of a key United Nations - sponsored Commission on Narcotic Drugs which convenes in Vienna next month .
The commission is to review the prevailing , harsh , U.S. - molded drug policies the U.N. General Assembly set in 1998 .
But there ’s the question : Will Obama ( and Hillary Clinton ’s State Department ) send reformers , or just bureaucrats who ’ve soldiered in our blind - alley war on drugs ?
Drug reformers were disappointed when Obama recently passed over public health advocates to appoint a police chief — Gil Kerlikowske of Seattle — as the country ’s new drug czar ( director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy ) .
But Kerlikowske does appear to have worked harmoniously with Seattle ’s cutting edge of drug reforms — well - established needle exchange programs , marijuana arrests declared the lowest law enforcement priority through public initiative , and a local bar association that ’s a national model in finding alternatives to drug prohibition laws .
So there are gleams of hope at the end of a long tunnel .
And what better time than this wrenching recession to shift law enforcement to legitimately serious crimes , starting to discharge the hundreds of nonviolent drug offenders held in our bulging , cost - heavy jails and prisons ?
Predictably , any shift will be tough .
Many law enforcement agencies count on the jobs — and seizures of cash — that the drug “ war ” delivers .
Our “ prison - industrial complex , ” guard unions included , remains potent .
And federal law actually prohibits the drug czar from recommending legalization of any proscribed drug , no matter what his personal judgment may be .
We have dug ourselves a deep hole .
Only forthright and courageous leadership is likely to start us on a saner path .
Can this be “ the time ? ” Please , Mr. President .

WASHINGTON -- Democratic congressional leaders , eager to trumpet that change has come to Washington , are looking to enact quickly a series of popular bills in January in such areas as renewable energy , children 's health care and embryonic stem - cell research .
The top priority remains an economic stimulus package .
But Democrats also want to tackle rapidly an array of bills they consider " low - hanging fruit . "
Those measures won considerable bipartisan support in the last Congress , but were vetoed , filibustered or otherwise blocked ...
Samsung 's Lapfit monitors are here to solve a problem most laptop owners are familiar with : the secondary monitor offset .
See , a laptop 's integrated display typically sits just a few centimeters above the desktop .
That can create an unnatural panning effect when trying to move the mouse or drag a window from your laptop 's display to the higher secondary .
Samsung 's solution is to offer these new low - profile monitors that sit at the same height as your ( desktop replacement - sized ) laptop 's display .
The 19 - ( LD190G ) and 22 - inch ( LD220G ) UbiSync Lapfit monitors offer a 10 - 30 degree tilt , a 1,360 x 768 ( 16:9 aspect ) pixel resolution , 4 ms response , and a 20,000:1 dynamic contrast .

Relational databases are only one option when it comes to storing your data .
Depending on the actual case , it might be worth taking a look at a key - value store .
If the data is stored and accessed mainly by a primary key , a key - value store might be a better option than the relational model .
So , what are key - value stores ?
The name sounds awfully similar to the plain - old hash , and conceptually , it 's just that .
Compared to a fully fledged RDBMS , key - value stores are much simpler , which is likely also the reason why there are so many competing implementations available .
We take a look at Tokyo Cabinet and Moneta , a unified interface for different key - value stores .
Tokyo Cabinet is a C library that implements a very fast and space efficient key - value store :
The database is a simple data file containing records , each is a pair of a key and a value .
Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length .
Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a value .
There is neither concept of data tables nor data types .
Records are organized in hash table , B+ tree , or fixed - length array .
Besides bindings for Ruby , there are also APIs for Perl , Java , and Lua available .
To share Tokyo Cabinet across machines , Tokyo Tyrant provides a server for concurrent and remote connections .
For some examples and more information on Tokyo Cabinet , you might want to take a look at Ilya Grigorik 's introductory article .
Suppose you have decided to use a key - value store , but do n't want to decide on a specific implementation yet , Moneta might come in handy .
It " aims to provide a unified interface for key / value stores " , similar to what Rack does for web servers , and as Yehuda Katz explains , " libraries that want to provide sugar around key / value stores ( e.g. Rails and Merb 's caching support ) can use Moneta as their backend " .
Out of the box , Moneta supports a file store , memcache store , in - memory store , the xattrs in a file system , DataMapper , as well as the aforementioned Tokyo Cabinet ( through rufus - tokyo , a " ruby - ffi based interface to Tokyo Cabinet and Tokyo Tyrant " ) .
Read more about Moneta on Yehuda 's blog or take a look at the github repository .
So Wall Street gets help to continue living their posh lifestyle with handouts but a single old man is left to die ?
The city office that shut down his electricity then has the nerve to push this out to the neighbors , that they should have been watching over him .
This is sickening .
A 93 - year - old man froze to death inside his home just days after the municipal power company restricted his use of electricity because of unpaid bills , officials said .
Marvin E. Schur died “ a slow , painful death , ” said Kanu Virani , Oakland County ’s deputy chief medical examiner , who performed the autopsy .
Neighbors discovered Schur ’s body on Jan. 17 .
They said the indoor temperature was below 32 degrees at the time , The Bay City Times reported Monday .
“ Hypothermia shuts the whole system down , slowly , ” Virani said .
“ It ’s not easy to die from hypothermia without first realizing your fingers and toes feel like they ’re burning . ”
Schur owed Bay City Electric Light & Power more than $ 1,000 in unpaid electric bills , Bay City Manager Robert Belleman told The Associated Press on Monday .
A city utility worker had installed a “ limiter ” device to restrict the use of electricity at Schur ’s home on Jan. 13 , Belleman said .
The device limits power reaching a home and blows out like a fuse if consumption rises past a set level .
Power is not restored until the device is reset .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea appears to be preparing to test - launch its longest range ballistic missile , media reports said on Tuesday , stoking tensions just days after the reclusive state warned that the Korean peninsula was on the brink of war .
North Korea last week scrapped all agreements with South Korea , a move analysts said was in response to Seoul ’s tough policies toward Pyongyang as well as designed to grab the attention of U.S. President Barack Obama .
Financial market analysts in South Korea , used to North Korean saber rattling , brushed off media reports about the possible test of the Taepodong - 2 missile , which is designed to eventually have a range long enough to hit U.S. territory .
South Korea ’s Yonhap news agency and Japan ’s Sankei Shimbun cited unnamed government sources as saying the North had been moving equipment used in the launch of the Taepodong - 2 , which it test - fired in July 2006 only to see it destruct a few seconds after leaving the launch pad .
A train carrying a large object had left a factory and was headed to the site of a newly constructed launch pad on the North ’s west coast , Yonhap quoted an unnamed South Korean government source as saying .
“ The object is suspected as being a Taepodong - 2 , ” he said .
It will take North Korea at least a month or two to actually launch a Taepodong - 2 , the Sankei cited an unnamed Japanese government source as saying .
The North , which tested a nuclear device in 2006 , is seen as one of the greatest threats to regional security .
But experts say they do not believe it has the technology to miniaturize an atomic weapon so it can be mounted on a missile as a warhead .
A security researcher at a South Korean state - run think tank said Pyongyang had two aims in carrying out a missile test .
“ First , it helps the North to continuously develop and upgrade its long - range missiles .
Second , they are seeking to send a political message , ” said the researcher , who asked not to be named because of the sensitive subject matter .
A drawn - out process for any launch could be a way for North Korea , which hates to be ignored , to put a timeframe on when it expects something positive from Seoul or Washington .
The North has repeatedly threatened to destroy the conservative government of South Korean President Lee Myung - bak , which ended a decade of free - flowing aid to Pyongyang after taking office a year ago .
The previous U.S. administration had also called for a halt to all energy aid to punish North Korea for failing to agree to a system to check claims it made about its atomic programs .
MARKETS UNFAZED
Financial analysts in South Korea paid little attention to the media reports .
“ If they actually launch the missile , it may put pressure on sentiment , but only in the short - term , ” said Hwang Keum - dan , an analyst at Samsung Securities .
A South Korean Defense Ministry official said he could not comment on intelligence matters .
Japanese government officials declined to comment .
Much of the preparation for such a launch can be seen by spy satellites .

A team of U.S. experts , including former U.S. ambassador to South Korea Stephen Bosworth , was due to arrive in Pyongyang on Tuesday for talks with North Korean officials .
The team is not an official delegation sent by Washington .
The North ’s bureaucracy works slowly to form policy and it may still be trying to figure out its approach to the new Obama team , analysts have said , making it easier for Pyongyang to direct much of its anger toward Seoul .
South Korea ’s Lee and Obama agreed in their first conversation after Obama took office to cooperate on North Korea , the South ’s presidential Blue House said of a Tuesday phone call .
The North has sharpened its rhetoric in recent days just as its leader Kim Jong - il , thought to have suffered a stroke in August , appears to be fully recovered .
Kim met a foreign envoy last month for the first time since his suspected illness and a U.S. intelligence source said last week that Kim , who turns 67 on February 16 , was firmly in control .

Motorists faced delays on the M11 in Cambridgeshire and Essex when a lorry shed its load of 300 aluminium beer barrels before the morning rush hour .
The full barrels were strewn across the southbound carriageway near Ugley between junction 9 for the A11 and junction 8 for Stansted Airport .
Five cars were later involved in a crash on the M11 at Great Chesterford causing severe delays .
The motorway was reopened by the Highways Agency at 1600 GMT .
The National Traffic Control Centre said traffic appeared to be moving again at 1620 GMT .
A Highways Agency spokesperson said : " The M11 southbound between Junction 10 and 8 is now open .
" Road users should expect some delays on the stretch of motorway approaching Junction 10 and down to Stansted Airport because of the impact of the earlier incidents .
This impact will reduce over time . "
Essex Police said no - one was injured in the accident involving the beer lorry which did not involve any other vehicles .
Each barrel contained 72 pints ( 41 litres ) of beer .
In the later accident , a man from Ely , aged in his 50s , was taken to hospital with serious injuries and is in a stable condition .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Thousands of dancers jammed a major London train station in a Facebook - driven " flashmob " mimicking an advertisement for a phone company .
And the event last Friday evening was so successful that another is planned for next Friday in Trafalgar Square in central London .
Plus , a group has been set up to organize another one at Liverpool Street Station a week later .
Videos posted on the social - networking site showed Liverpool Street Station completely filled with people , counting down the seconds until the clock showed 7 p.m. , then dancing to music on their mp3 players as the hour struck .
The sheer scale of the event came as a complete surprise to the organizer , a 22 - year - old Facebook user who identified himself only as Crazzy Eve .
" I was watching TV and the T - Mobile advertisement came up and I thought , hm , let 's get my friends down to Liverpool Street and do a little dance , " he told CNN by phone .
He posted the event on Facebook and invited his friends , who invited their friends , he said , and so on until thousands of people had been told of the plan .
" At a quarter to seven people just flocked into the station like someone opened a plughole and the water went out , " he said .
" They just kept coming in like sheep .
As it grew and grew , I just thought , ' This is going to be huge . ' "

Send your photos and video
His main memory of the event is " the volume of people -- you could n't see the floor , " he said .
He left after 15 minutes -- the scheduled ending time -- for fear of the police , he said , adding that he had deleted his name from the event Web site and refused to identify himself to CNN for the same reason .
" The entire main concourse was packed full of people dancing , cheering and screaming , " said CNN 's Simon Hooper , who was passing through the station on his way home .
" There were camera flashes going off constantly .
There were also loads of people crammed around the edge of the upper level of the station , looking down at the scene below .
" There were a lot of bemused commuters wandering around the edges , trying to get to their trains but nobody seemed to mind too much .
Everyone seemed pretty good humored , " he said .
" I think a lot of people who pass through Liverpool Street regularly are getting used to this sort of thing . "
British Transport Police also described it as " mainly a good humored event , " adding " No arrests were made and no crimes were reported . "
Police did not have an immediate estimate of the crowd size , but more than 14,000 people joined the Facebook group " Liverpool Street Station Silent Dance . "
" It was both good cause we all stuck like a group did n't stop dancing inside and outside but bad cause of the people who could get anywhere but hey I love it WE MADE HISTORY RIGHT THERE !! " one Facebook user said on the event 's Web site .
" Yeah I agree , there was n't any bad feelings there .
Everybody just had a good time , apart from my friend being groped by some guy , but you 'll always get one , " another wrote .
The T - Mobile commercial which inspired the event shows several hundred people dancing in the station .
The dancing in the advertisement appears to be spontaneous but was actually choreographed .
It was filmed January 15 and has been widely broadcast since then .
The success of the event has prompted Crazzy Eve to call for another silent dance at Trafalgar Square in central London on February 13 .
A group has been set up to organize another one at Liverpool Street Station a week later .
The station has a large open space with a balcony surrounding it .
User videos shot from the balcony and posted on Facebook showed every available inch of space filled with people , many of them cheering , though the event was billed as " silent . "
Flashmobs -- groups of people meeting and all doing the same thing together in public , from dancing to freezing in place -- have become increasingly regular events around the world .
iReport.com : See an organized mass pillowfight in Taiwan
London 's Tate Modern art museum was the scene of a flashmob dance in 2007 , and hundreds of people froze in place in Trafalgar Square , then formed a conga line in 2008 .
Charlie Todd , a comedian and founder of the New York group Improv Everywhere , which organizes flashmobs , says the point of the group 's " missions " is simple .
" We get satisfaction from coming up with an awesome idea and making it come to life , " he writes on the group 's Web site .
" In the process we bring excitement to otherwise unexciting locales and give strangers a story they can tell for the rest of their lives .
We 're out to prove that a prank does n't have to involve humiliation or embarrassment ; it can simply be about making someone laugh , smile , or stop to notice the world around them . "
The female college students who enthusiastically supported Barack Obama for president might not know that he wants women to register with the Selective Service at age 18 , just as men do .
Or that he wants the military to officially open combat positions to women .
Although the topic was drowned out by campaign rhetoric and statements on policies that college students find more congenial , his position on registration of women is clear .
And Obama ’s national security spokeswoman stated before the election that Obama intended to change current policies on women in combat .
Women are “ already ” serving in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan , said Wendy Morigi , Mr. Obama ’s national security spokeswoman .
If elected president , she said , Obama will “ consult with military commanders to review the constraints that remain . ”
In other words , he wants to eliminate gender discrimination from the armed services .
No doubt president - elect Obama views both of these stances as leveling the playing field for women , an extension of the equal opportunity he wants to create for all Americans .
And maybe this is a plank that today ’s 18 - year - old females think is cool .
I do n’t .
Senator Obama ’s two positions threaten women ’s liberty and safety .
I can agree with the Senator , and feminists , to a point .
No one should be disqualified from a position based solely on sex .
However , there is at least one big problem with opening combat positions to women – currently , women do not have to meet the same physical fitness standards as men .
The military ’s tests for strength , speed and stamina are scaled according to age and gender .
In direct combat , having women who are weaker and slower than men could be disastrous .
According to the 1992 report of a presidential commission on women in the armed forces , most women fall far below most men in meeting such standards .
“ In terms of physical capability , the upper five percent of women are at the level of the male median , ” the report said .
“ The average 20 - to - 30 year - old woman has the same aerobic capacity as a 50 year - old man . ”
Current Department of Defense restrictions on women in combat units – including tank , field artillery and Special Forces – exist for good reasons .
Most women do n’t have the upper - body strength to haul heavy weapons or wounded team members .
Under field conditions , they lack the stamina of most men .
In general , women are shorter , lighter , and slower than their male counterparts .
And the field of combat is not designed for affirmative action .
The desert is not more forgiving to women than to men .
Gunfire will not slow down for a woman who ca n’t run as fast as a man .
Individuals who cannot meet the standards set for the most able soldiers will not perform as well .
Holding women to lower standards than men puts them at a disadvantage on the battlefield , particularly in the offensive operations or “ direct ground combat ” from which they are currently barred .
But no woman ( or man ) exists as a generality .
Many experts agree that some women have the physical strength and endurance to be combat soldiers .
Women who are strong enough and fast enough , physically and mentally , for participation on the front lines should n’t be barred based on gender .
Department of Defense tests should be objective measures based on the requirements of the job .
Women who cannot meet those standards would be safer and more effective elsewhere .
And for those women who can meet objective standards , lowering the bar is merely insulting .
Opponents of women in combat insist that challenges would arise from having women in combat units , but the preponderance of military divisions have already met those challenges .
The US military is still the most effective in the world .
A real step forward for women would be to remove both the current restrictions on combat and the affirmative action that endangers them on the battlefield .
Opening the door to the draft would not accomplish much for women , either .
Although Obama does not explicitly favor a draft , his proposal to register women as well as men moves us further in that direction .
I oppose registration for both men and women .
Conscription is bad policy for a number of reasons .
Branches of the armed services , having tried it both ways , strongly prefer an all - volunteer force , according to the Army Times .
Many high - ranking officers in the military explain that motivated volunteers perform much better than indifferent draftees .
Moreover , morale is far better when all involved feel strongly that they are engaged in a noble and chosen pursuit than when they are forced to participate in an activity they would not choose .
Most importantly , the draft is involuntary servitude – regardless of gender .
The very concept of conscription , or even registration with the Selective Service , is incompatible with the principle of liberty .
Years ago , economist Milton Friedman famously campaigned against the draft in his Newsweek column .
He argued that it was not only uneconomical but that it violates the Constitution .
Requiring women to register for selective service would simply make more people susceptible to the injustice it inflicts on those who are drafted .
So , in answer to Senator Obama ’s offer , I have one reply : “ no deal . ”

( Fortune Magazine ) --
These are brutally difficult times for automakers worldwide , but as crises go , this one could be a lot worse for Wendelin Wiedeking , Porsche 's chief executive for the past 16 years .
Thanks to an astute mixture of long - term strategic foresight and short - term financial wizardry , Wiedeking has Porsche headed into this downturn in an extraordinarily strong position .
The company is sitting on a $ 20 billion mountain of capital - more money than the U.S. government is injecting into GM , Ford , and Chrysler combined .
More important , Wiedeking , 58 , has secured Porsche 's future through an audacious David vs. Goliath takeover of Volkswagen , Germany ' largest automaker and a company that has so far weathered the crisis better than most of its peers .
" Wiedeking very cleverly purchased a life insurance policy for Porsche by buying VW , " says Peter Schmidt , an auto consultant based in Britain .
" He 's a brilliant , focused leader who grabbed VW for peanuts and is making a fortune out of it . "
Schmidt is referring to a feat that guarantees Wiedeking a place in the record books : Porsche 's profits before taxes of $ 11.6 billion in the fiscal year ended in July were actually larger than its total revenues from sales of $ 10.2 billion .
Not even Google has profits exceeding 100 % .
Only 12 % of Porsche 's profits came from making cars .
The remainder is the fruit of a brilliantly sophisticated stock - hedging strategy ( yes , sometimes they do work ) that was hatched by CFO Holgar Hrter before Porsche started buying into VW , and ended up panicking short - sellers and enriching the automaker .
The gambit also let it acquire VW stock at a price well below market .
On Jan. 5 , Porsche announced that it now owns just over 50 % of VW and holds options that would raise that stake to 74 % .
The joke making the rounds in industry circles is that Porsche is a hedge fund attached to a car company .
Porsche is n't laughing .
It says it hedged only to further its strategic goals as an automaker .
As a manufacturer producing just 100,000 cars per year for well - heeled clients , including bankers and hedge fund managers , Porsche could now be in a dire situation .
But though its sales have slumped in recent months along with the rest of the industry 's , the company seems poised to grow .
This is a testament to Wiedeking 's leadership , which has transformed the German sports car maker from a business that was close to collapse when he took it over in 1992 to the world 's most consistently profitable automaker and the firm regularly chosen by German managers as the nation 's best run .
A man of the people
Wiedeking likes to think of himself as a man of the people - he regularly walks through the assembly line at the Stuttgart factory and tools around potato fields near his home in a vintage Porsche tractor .
That folksy image has been tarnished recently by disclosures about his salary :
Last year he made $ 100 million , sparking an outcry in Germany .
He 's unapologetic , saying he earned it .
A mechanical engineer by training , he 's obsessed with detail and loves poring over technicalities in search of perfection .
After sitting down with Fortune in his Stuttgart office , located in a brick building next to the factory where the 911 is produced , he rushes off to inspect a new corporate museum that Porsche is about to open .
He quickly spots a sloping ceiling with a water sprinkler low enough to be tampered with by visitors , and orders the sprinkler moved .
Such attention to detail is an important part of Wiedeking 's management style , as is his willingness to seek dissenting opinions .
Indeed , he encourages his managers to air their disagreements in full , so that he can make well - informed decisions .
When it comes to pricing new models , for example , he does n't want to hear just the suggestions of his sales executives .
So he regularly charges his strategic planning team to come up with their own proposals - and then lets the two sides slug it out .
" I provoke internal discussions , " he says .
" I want managers to put forward their position , to fight for decisions .
Sometimes there 's a bust - up , not just between me and them but with one another . "
That blunt , confrontational style was a critical element in saving Porsche during the last serious downturn .
Wiedeking joined the automaker fresh out of engineering school in 1983 as an assistant to the head of production .
He left five years later to work at a supplier but returned in 1991 as production head and was made CEO in September 1992 .
At the time Porsche was sliding into a life - threatening crisis .
It had boomed in the mid-1980s on the back of buoyant demand from America , which then accounted for about two - thirds of sales .
But as the U.S. economy hit the skids , Porsche car sales dropped 80 % , and its losses piled up .
It was n't just the demise of a key market that was painful ; Porsche was also hampered by antiquated production methods .
Some 20 % of its parts were delivered three or more days too late , for example .
Wiedeking , who had been deeply impressed by what he'd seen on visits to Japanese auto firms , believed that only a radical , " lean manufacturing " cure would save the company .
He flew in teams of the same Japanese consultants who had helped Toyota and gave them free rein .
" A cultural revolution from top to bottom " is the way he describes what happened next , as the consultants organized the workforce into teams and one by one eliminated poor practices .
Wiedeking made one now - fabled appearance on the assembly line wielding a circular saw , which he used to cut down the roof - high racks of spare parts that towered over the production line .
Porsche quickly became an exemplary proponent of " just - in - time , just - in - sequence " manufacturing , and its fortunes revived .
But Wiedeking 's revolution was n't over yet .
His next moves , focusing on new models , consisted of outsourcing the expensive parts of the manufacturing process as a way of keeping overhead low and boosting Porsche 's profit margins .
The guts of the Cayenne model are manufactured in Bratislava , Slovakia , at a VW plant alongside VW 's own Touareg SUV and the Audi Q7 , although final assembly takes place in Porsche 's plant in Leipzig , Germany .
The new Panamera four - door luxury sedan , which will be launched this spring , is manufactured primarily at an underutilized VW plant in Hanover .
All that translates into profit margins per car that Detroit can only fantasize about .
The company earned more than $ 1.4 billion before taxes last year on its autos , an average of some $ 14,000 apiece - and its margins are about double those of BMW .
Consultant Schmidt calls Porsche a " huge money - printing machine . "
Wiedeking realized , however , that as a boutique Porsche did not have what it takes to compete in an increasingly global market .
In 2005 the CEO started buying into VW , at a time when VW stock was below $ 50 .
Today it 's at almost $ 400 , and in October it briefly hit more than twice that when Porsche revealed that it indirectly owned options to acquire 74 % of VW .
( Analysts are guessing that the company is paying an average price for VW stock of $ 100 to $ 150 per share . )
The announcement sparked such a panic by short - sellers that the company offered to boost liquidity by selling options on more than 3 % of VW stock - making in the process another tidy profit that Goldman Sachs estimates to be about $ 8 billion .
Among the victims of the Porsche VW stock squeeze was a leading German industrialist , Adolf Merckle , who committed suicide in early January after losing hundreds of millions of dollars .
Part of those losses came from his disastrous shorting of VW shares .
Filling some holes
Apart from the opportunity to snap up a big player for a bargain price , there was another reason why the tie - up made sense for Porsche : new European environmental regulations that will strictly limit carbon emissions from autos , starting in 2015 .
Porsche was not likely to meet the emission targets and would thus face huge fines .
But since emissions will be measured on a group - wide basis , becoming part of VW , which sells many low - emission cars , would remove the problem .
In that sense , it 's a case of Porsche 's needing VW more than VW needs Porsche .
" You buy what you need , " Wiedeking says .
Another thing he does need is a bigger presence in the U.S. market .
VW will manufacture there for the first time in some 20 years , after it completes a $ 1 billion factory in Chattanooga .
VW also gives Wiedeking the scale to play in emerging markets , where auto analysts expect most growth to occur .
VW sells almost as many cars in China as it does in its home market , and its Skoda brand is strong in Eastern Europe .
Wiedeking talks about how he 's itching to take on Toyota on its home turf .
" VW for too long left Asia to the Japanese , " he says .
Above all , he believes his strategy of twinning Porsche 's future with VW 's is being vindicated by the sudden downturn in the world economy .
" Can you imagine what would be happening now if we had n't done this ?
Imagine the discussion that would be going on about Porsche 's ability to survive ! " he says .
Not all has gone smoothly , however .
Porsche 's power play provoked a mixture of fear and loathing at VW , and the reaction has taken Wiedeking by surprise .
When the CEO promised in a German interview last year that there would be " no sacred cows " at VW , that company 's top labor official , Bernd Osterloh , fired back , accusing Wiedeking of nurturing " dangerous power fantasies " and having " zero finesse . "
More surprisingly , some of the heat has come from a key shareholder , Ferdinand Pich , a member of the extended family that owns Porsche .
He also plays a central role at VW as head of the supervisory board .
Amid the turbulence caused by Porsche 's move , Pich for a while took VW 's side , to the delight of the labor unions there , and the German press last year was filled with leaks that he wanted Wiedeking 's head .
In the end , Pich backed off after the matter was thrashed out at a tense September meeting of family shareholders , who unequivocally endorsed Wiedeking 's leadership .
Wiedeking says the criticism is understandable .
" Of course it hurts when the little firm buys up the big one .
It could n't be otherwise , " he says , but adds that the " scars are now slowly healing . "
As for Pich 's gunning for him , Wiedeking shrugs .
" I 'm relatively relaxed about it all , " he says .
" The shareholders need to decide what management they want , but I 'm not going to force myself on anyone .
If they think they need a change , I 'll accept that . "
He adds , " I 've earned a lot of money .
I am very independent .
Ask my colleagues : I 've never been so relaxed . "
Spoken like a man used to being in the driver 's seat .

One of the popular “ survival ” plans is the “ Bug Out Bag ” ( aka BOB ) .
Members of the survival community that use the Bug out bag , and a “ head to the hills ” philosophy are sometimes called backpack survivalist .
The “ backpack survivalist ” is a person who plans on leaving their home either ahead of a disaster or during the disaster , depending on the situation .
The Survivalist , with their Bug Out Bag and family in tow , will head to some parcel of wilderness .
Usually the plans include using national forest land as the retreat , areas close to large lakes where camp grounds already exist or maybe even public hunting land .
When discussing these plans in detail with other survivalist , usually , exact details have not been thought out .
Example of a bug out plan :
A few years ago one survivalist was talking about his plans , which included driving about 14 – 18 hours ( normal drive time ) , across two states in order to reach a large US national park .
Exact details such as refueling stops , rest areas and actual camping grounds had not been planned out .
The story sounded more like a mix between the Boy Scouts and a Rambo movie .
The survivalist plans for a bug out usually goes something like this :
1 . If there is a traffic jam I can just drive around it by using the ditch or grassy median .
2. Survivalsit try to buy a 4 - wheel drive so they can go off road where other types of cars and light trucks can not .
3 . The motorcycle is a common consideration for the survivalist .
As the motorcycle gets good gas mileage and can zip through traffic jams .
4 . Sometimes the survivalist will have a cache of goods left with friends and family along the planned route .
5 . Some survivalist even go as far as to bury items along the planned routes .
The cache is usually next to a tree , or some other land mark .
The caches are usually heavy duty PVC pipe or some type of air tight container .
6 . Most survivalist that use the “ Bug Out Bag ” plan intend on traveling very light , with at least 3 days worth of supplies for each person .
7 . If there is a need for more supplies during the Bug Out , the survivalist can dig up some of the buried caches along the route .
The fallacy of these plans are – the typical backpack survivalist does not have a place to go once they and their family have “ Bugged Out . ”
There are usually hopes of finding lodging , a camping ground or some wilderness area where the survivalist and their family can stay until the disaster has passed .
The very concept of “ living in the woods ” is flawed .
Even though early man was a hunter - gatherer , the landscape has changed .
Wild plants do not grow in numbers great enough to support a newly founded village .
Season is very important , early man would smoke and dry meat for most of the summer to have during the winter .
If a family were to just show up in a wilderness area and hope to “ survive ” – its highly doubtful the plan would last .
After starving for a few days , a few days with no wild game brought in for food , bad weather setting in , rain , sleet , snow , boredom , wondering about friends and family members , running out of toilet paper , sickness , missing a hot shower , bath and a normal toilet – there will be a demand from most members of the group to return to normal life .
Once a family leaves their home and does not have a place to go , they are called refugees .
Most refugees will be sleeping in shelters set up by local churches , the red cross , the salvation army or some other organization .
That is just the way it is , refugees depend on the charity of others .
The refugees that do not sleep in shelters will be sleeping in their cars or trucks .
The best plan a survivalist can have , is to have a “ real ” plan .
This means that the family has a real place to go – such as a friend or family members house .
The routes have already been planned and driven .
The rest areas , refueling stations and places to buy food ( survivalist should bring their own food ) should already be plotted , noted and known ahead of time .

THE recipe for making any creature is written in its DNA .
So last November , when geneticists published the near - complete DNA sequence of the long - extinct woolly mammoth , there was much speculation about whether we could bring this behemoth back to life .
Creating a living , breathing creature from a genome sequence that exists only in a computer ’s memory is not possible right now .
But someone someday is sure to try it , predicts Stephan Schuster , a molecular biologist at Pennsylvania State University , University Park , and a driving force behind the mammoth genome project .
So besides the mammoth , what other extinct beasts might we coax back to life ?
Well , it is only going to be possible with creatures for which we can retrieve a complete genome sequence .
Without one , there is no chance .
And usually when a creature dies , the DNA in any flesh left untouched is soon destroyed as it is attacked by sunshine and bacteria .
There are , however , some circumstances in which DNA can be preserved .
If your specimen froze to death in an icy wasteland such as Siberia , or snuffed it in a dark cave or a really dry region , for instance , then the probability of finding some intact stretches of DNA is much higher .
Even in ideal conditions , though , no genetic information is likely to survive more than a million years – so dinosaurs are out – and only much younger remains are likely to yield good - quality DNA .
“ It ’s really only worth studying specimens that are less than 100,000 years old , ” …
There ’s nothing like the dawn of a new year to give a person a fresh perspective , and that ’s probably never been more true than it is now , as we begin this year of monumental change .
So it ’s not surprising that the conversations on the Linux blogs over this past week seemed to be taking place on a somewhat higher plane than usual , and to touch upon questions from more of a bird ’s eye view .
On the Linux Loop , for example , Thomas Teisberg presented some of the highlights of the Linux dreams for 2009 that readers had submitted over the past few weeks — both the popular ones ( more games and better hardware support , for instance ) and the particularly interesting ones ( dual - boot PCs straight out of the box was one ) .
Never underestimate the power of dreams — particularly as Martin Luther King Jr. Day approaches !
Biggest Moves for Linux in 2008
Over on LXer , meanwhile , bloggers debated what were the biggest moves and non-moves for FOSS in 2008 .
The fact that more mainstream computer sellers shipped Linux , for example , was one big move named by number6x — “ either that or Linux on smartphones . ”
“ I think those guys pretty much hit it on the head , ” Monochrome Mentality blogger Kevin Dean told LinuxInsider .
“ I ’d have to say that the netbook surge was probably the biggest move for Linux , followed behind with the press about and release of Android , ” he said .
‘ That Nails the Coffin Shut ’
“ That ’s a tough one , because there were so many watershed events , ” blogger Robert Pogson began .
“ From the viewpoint of adoption , I believe the move by many OEMs to support / use / distribute GNU / Linux will build user - base / exposure to GNU / Linux assuring vibrancy for the foreseeable future , ” Pogson told LinuxInsider .
Close upon that , however , “ is the admission by M$ that Vista does not deliver , ” he added .
“ That nails the coffin shut on the monopoly . ”
Indeed , “ I think the biggest moves towards free software this year had more to do with external forces such as the flop that is Vista being forced on the masses of unwilling victims that are Microsoft ’s customers and the continued downward trend in notebook prices that have caused netbooks to happen , ” Montreal consultant and Slashdot blogger Gerhard Mack told LinuxInsider .
‘ All Eyes on Vietnam ’
Then , of course , there was the news that Vietnam is requiring all government computers to move to Linux , which attracted significant attention on blogs including Digg ( with more than 700 Diggs and 150 comments ) , Slashdot ( with close to 400 comments ) and Pogson ’s own , among others .
“ That ’s kind of cool , ” Slashdot blogger yagu told LinuxInsider .
“ Maybe that government gets it .
Or maybe it ’s simply a move to save money .
Or , as we ’ve seen previously , it ’s just a veiled plea for yet another sweetheart deal from Microsoft : ‘ Give us a break , or we ’ll go to Linux … ' ”
Microsoft not only “ usually capitulates ” in such cases , yagu noted , “ they turn it into a great PR coup for themselves .
“ What I ’d rather see in the news is a story about a government that has gone strictly Open Source and been successful for some time , say , at least 2 or 3 years , ” yagu added .
“ All eyes on Vietnam in the meantime . ”
‘ I See No Good In This ’
On the other hand : “ The reason I love Linux is that it ’s an alternative , a choice , ” Dean said .
“ Linux is the essence of my philosophy , turned into code .
It ’s all about choice , about benefit to self without bringing harm to others . ”
While it ’s good to see more and more people make that choice , “ I ’m greatly saddened that Linux is being forced upon people in such a manner , ” Dean explained .
“ You ca n’t force people to be free , so I see no good in this at all .
Of course , I ’d feel the same if it were Windows .
It ’s the force , not the OS , that takes center stage on this issue to me . ”
Strangers in Strange Lands
Finally , it was with much interest that we discovered an interesting juxtaposition on the blogs last week in which the OS * did * take center stage — front and center .
Specifically , on two separate blogs , we heard the tales of one Linux guy who spent a week using Windows , and one Windows guy who spent a week on Linux .
The Linux guy trying out Windows was none other than Dean , who asked , “ Can a Linux man survive in Windows land ? ”
From there , Dean chronicles his adventures in “ The Windows Seat , ” including looks at BIOS , “ Virtualization and Bitness , ” Shutdown and Interfaces .
‘ Penguins and Crazy Beards ’
Visiting Linux land for the first time , meanwhile , was zMogo ’s AshPringle , who spent his week on Ubuntu as part of a New Year ’s Resolution .
“ Step one is to research what Linux has to offer nowadays , ” AshPringle began in his Day One report .
“ I know absolutely nothing about it , other than the fact that it is associated with penguins and guys with crazy beards , and that I remember it having all the subtlety and ease of use of a sledgehammer to the patience - center of your brain . ”
Could one ask for a more perfect comparison ?
We could n’t suppress our glee , and so took to the streets to explore what conclusions might be drawn .
Different Expectations
“ The first thing that really jumped out to me starts at the beginning for him , ” said Dean , who had n’t seen AshPringle ’s series .
“ Specifically , he mentioned ‘ a moment of apprehension ’ as he feared he selected the wrong drive .
“ When I did my review , I did n’t even address the installer since I felt it was unremarkable , ” Dean explained .
“ But I suppose that highlights a point .
As a Linux user , I fully expect to install my operating system myself .
Even though I have three drives in my home system , I know by partitioning scheme which is which in both C : jargon , / dev / mapper jargon AND GRUBs ( 0,0,0 , ) disklabels .
It ’s almost instinctual , actually . ”
The fact that Linux came pre-installed on several devices was perhaps a “ much bigger deal than I gave credit to , ” Dean now says .
‘ The Community Came Through ’
“ The second thing I point out is that while Ubuntu ’s install actually failed for him , the community support came though , ” Dean added .
“ I think the community of users and wealth of tutorials and documentation is a strong plus for Linux in general . ”
Finally , “ he seemed to find Linux enjoyable only after obtaining a computer that worked well with Linux , ” Dean noted .
“ I always build my own PCs from parts , so I always know what ’s in them .
But since I ’m also a Linux user , I tend to build with parts that I expect will work with Linux . ”
Dean ’s conclusion after his week on Windows ?
“ The biggest thing I saw was n’t about Linux or Windows , but myself and how I compute .
Dramatics shifts from that home base tend to make things falter , but there can be some very pleasant surprises there . :) ”
Back to Competition
Others also found lessons to be learned in the comparison .
“ It seems to me that Linux users can adapt and exist in a Windows world ( I ’m one of them ! ) , ” yagu said .
“ It ’s also clear the opposite is true — a Windows user can live happily using Linux ( I ’m one of them , too ! ) . ”
The missing piece , however , is competition , yagu added .
“ Unless and until some perfect storm of the marketplace repositions Linux prominently , Linux has to work harder and be better , far better , to even compete for consideration , ” he explained .
“ Maybe the new administration will have some appetite for more and better scrutiny of Microsoft ’s continued battering of the computing market . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Prices are falling for just about everything these days .
The government will report its key inflation index Friday morning , the Consumer Price Index , and economists believe the report is likely to show the first year - over - year drop in prices since 1955 .
But while shoppers might see that as good news , economists generally view this as a threat to an already struggling economy .
That 's because deflation , or a widespread drop in prices , is one of the most destructive forces that can hit an economy .
Lower prices are one way businesses respond to the lack of demand for their products in a slowdown .
But if companies can't make a profit selling their products at the lower price , they 'll respond by cutting production and laying off more people .
More job losses can cut even further into demand .
But even if consumers have jobs and money , they 're likely to hold off on purchases if they come to believe that prices will head even lower .
All of which adds up to even more weakness in the economy .
Deflation is most often associated with the Great Depression .
In 1930 , consumer prices fell 2.3 % and plunged 9 % a year later .
Prices fell nearly 10 % in 1932 before the rate of decline started to slow .
Still , prices did n't turn higher again until 1934 .
The U.S. is nowhere close to that type of deflationary spiral just yet .
Economists forecast that the year - over - year drop in January was just 0.1 %
Much of that decline has been driven by lower gas prices .
But there is clear evidence that falling prices are spreading beyond the pump .
The core CPI , which strips out food and energy prices , fell at a compounded annual rate of 0.3 % in the fourth quarter of 2008 .
Worries grow about more salary cuts
The potential economic pain that can be caused by deflation is so great that St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard identified it in a speech Tuesday as the greatest risk facing the economy this year .
" I think we face some risk -- at this point only a risk -- of sustained deflation , " he said , adding that " ongoing deflation in the United States might be particularly pernicious . "
Some economists agree that deflation should now be a major concern .
" I think we 're on the precipice of outright , full - blown deflation and that we 'll fall into that abyss by this summer , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist for Moody's Economy.com .
" Given the pressures businesses are under to sell something , they 'll have to cut prices and I think they will . "
Zandi said his biggest worry about deflation is that it may cause more employers to cut wages , which could lead to even lower prices down the road .
Some companies have already begun to reduce salaries .
General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) is cutting the pay of all of its remaining U.S. salaried staff between 3 % and 10 % as of May 1 .
" Right now millions of people are losing their jobs , and as painful as that is , it affects only a small fraction of 150 million workers , " Zandi said .
" If you 're cutting wages broadly across 150 million people , that 's a far bigger problem for the economy . "
Deflation or disinflation ?
But other economists argue that falling prices are not a significant threat to the economy .
They point out that consumer prices fell in the mid-1950's , a relative period of prosperity .
And they add that the current drop in prices may simply be a temporary decline due to an adjustment between supply and demand .
" To have deflation , you have to have the price structure collapsing , " said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research .
" Disinflation is the D word we should be using , " he added , meaning that he thinks prices wo n't rise dramatically going forward as opposed to continuing to fall .
Yamarone says the steps taken by the Federal Reserve and Treasury to pump trillions into the nation 's banking system will keep deflation from taking hold the way it did during the Great Depression and in Japan 's " lost decade " that started in the 1990's .
" Those policymakers did nothing for decades , " he said .
" We 're throwing everything imaginable and several things that are unimaginable at the problem . "
But Yamarone concedes that prices for many products will be kept in check for awhile , partly because of weak demand in the near - term and demographic changes in the longer term .
" There is too much capacity for everything right now - too many malls , too many auto plants , " he said " The Boomers are in the process of retiring and 60 - year old Boomers do n't need 2.5 cars in the driveway . "
Exploring Strategies for Training Deep Neural Networks
Hugo Larochelle , Yoshua Bengio , Jérôme Louradour , Pascal Lamblin ; 10 ( 1) :1−40 , 2009 .
Abstract
Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly - varying functions .
However , until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks , since gradient - based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions .
Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer - wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines ( RBM ) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network ( DBN ) , a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables .
This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer - wise procedure , relying on the usage of autoassociator networks .
In the context of the above optimization problem , we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success .
Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer - wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum , but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high - level abstractions of the input .
We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology , for example , demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps .
Finally , we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms , such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions , a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance , as well as on - line versions of those algorithms .
TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Iran Tuesday successfully launched its first satellite into orbit , a step hailed by Iran 's president as a " source of pride " for the Islamic republic , according to state - run news outlets .
Reported satellite launch took place on the 30th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran .
U.S. Department of Defense officials confirmed the launch , and the State Department expressed " grave concern . "
" Developing a space launch vehicle that could ... put a satellite into orbit could possibly lead to development of a ballistic missile system , " State Department acting spokesman Robert Wood told reporters .
" So that 's of grave concern to us . "
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to discuss Iran in meetings Tuesday with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
On Wednesday officials from the United States , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China will meet in Germany to discuss next steps on Iran .
Wood said that Undersecretary William Burns , who is representing the United States , will seek input and discuss some ideas the Obama administration has about how to move forward .
Watch Iran launch its first satellite »
Two U.S. officials confirmed that Iran had launched a low - earth orbit satellite , CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr said .
There were no indications of any weapons activity on the two - stage rocket , although the rocket is capable of launching long - range weapons , the officials said .
" I would n't think of this in terms of highly advanced technology , " one U.S. official said .
But it does suggest Iran 's two - stage rockets are increasingly reliable .
The Pentagon said Tuesday the launch is " clearly a concern of ours . "
" Although this appears to be satellite , there are dual - use capabilities that could be applied to missiles , and that 's a concern to us and everybody in region , " Department of Defense spokesman Geoff Morrell said .
The launch of the satellite Omid -- which means " Hope " in Farsi -- was timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary celebrations of the Islamic revolution in Iran , according to Iranian media reports .
Iran said the satellite had already completed its first mission -- to transmit a message from Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who spoke at the launching ceremony Monday night .
In his message , Ahmadinejad congratulated the nation and said the successful launch improves Iran 's status in the world , the Islamic Republic News Agency reported .
He stressed that both the satellite and the Safir rocket used to launch it were made entirely by Iranian technicians .
Iranian Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad Najjar said that despite the small size of the Omid satellite , it will open the way for an Iranian space program .
He said Tehran plans to launch another satellite in the future .
In August , Iran performed a test of a rocket capable of launching a satellite into orbit .
Iranian officials declared that mission a success , but U.S. officials disputed that .
Senior U.S. officials had expressed concerned about the test of the rocket , saying Iran could use the rocket to deliver warheads .

Since open source became a powerful force in the software world , it has gone through several phases .
The first phase was built around universities and volunteers , with little business involvement .
As open source grew , companies like Red Hat were created to simplify deployment of open source software in enterprises .
With the popularity of open source , companies that distributed their software as open source , but were company - controlled , started to proliferate , like MySQL .
The distinction between openly - developed open source software and company - developed open source software is still not widely understood .
One big distinction is that , for company - developed open source software , a company controls the development process , and bears the full cost of development , which leads to greater customer lock - in and potential future costs as the company maximizes its profits .
Cloud vendors have upended many of the plans of companies built around open source .
While open source is often valued by vendors and customers for its rapid proliferation and deployment , there was always a hope that expertise in the open source software would yield sufficient revenue opportunities .
What has upended their plans are cloud vendors , who already have a customer relationship by providing cloud infrastructure .
They use open source software as an up - sell to cloud customers , bypassing vendors that specialize in open source .
This excellent article exposes much of this shift , particularly with this statement :
From an economic perspective ( which is what all the industry think pieces and analogies are about ) , the clouds seem to make a better business from open source than the companies built around particular projects .
If you squint , open source could be seen as a very generous charitable donation to some of the largest and wealthiest corporations on the planet .
Instead of open source vendors providing software to be used by potential customers , it is also being used by actual competitors , often much larger and more visible competitors .
Such is the problem of open source , that you can't easily control how it is used , though some company - developed open source companies , that do control the software license , are taking steps to avoid this situation , with predictable reactions from the cloud vendors .
The biggest " wow " moment for me in reading this article was the analysis of Red Hat .
Company - developed open source companies were always at risk , since they bore the full cost of software development and had a clear monetization strategy — grow and then maximize monetization , but Red Hat was different .
It was the poster - child of pure open source ( collect from others and bundle ) that should have been more immune to the cloud , but the graphs in the blog clearly show that the purchase of Red Hat by ibm was due to cloud competition on Red Hat .
This blog entry from the same person goes into even more gory details .
It is not really clear where open source monetization is headed .
If cloud vendors were smart , they would keep open source - dedicated companies alive with enough revenue to continue funding open source development and innovation .
While open source companies have often yielded high valuations , they have rarely yielded high profits , except perhaps , years ago , for Red Hat .
The high - profits world now seems even more distant for open source companies , as cloud vendors , with existing customer relationships , massive standardized infrastructure and services , and economies of scale , siphon even more profit from these businesses .
When the hilarious Okami cover art blunder was discovered , Capcom issued replacement coverslips to those who felt that it was an error so egregious that they deserved new digs .
Generally speaking , publishers and developers typically do n’t offer optional covers , but that ’s exactly what Insomniac is doing over at the official PlayStation blog -- and no , it is n't because there 's an IGN watermark in the original stuff .
To get one ( or all three three ) , head on over to Sony ’s blog , click on the image of your choice and pick “ Original ” size .
It may not be as cool as pimping your car , however after printing and applying you can now lie to your friends that are n’t in the “ know ” and say you got some sort of special , enhanced game .
Things turned bad for Sea Shepherd when they arrived back to port in Tasmania today .
They were greeted by Australian federal police who boarded the Steve Irwin ship with a warrant .
[ social_buttons ]
They confiscated “ all edited and raw video footage , all edited and raw audio recordings , all still photographs , producer ’s notes , interview transcripts , production meeting minutes , post production meeting minutes as well as the ship ’s log books , global positioning system records , automatic radar plotting aid , purchase records , receipts , financial transaction records , voyage information and navigational plotted charts . ”
Sea Shepherd said they believe the action was taken after intense diplomatic pressure on Australia from Japan , which faced international criticism stemming from the last season of Animal Planet ’s Whale Wars television show .
Surely they ’d love to prevent the second season from airing .
“ It ’s a very one - sided affair , ” said Captain Watson .
“ The Japanese ships have not been boarded by the Australian Federal Police ; they have not had their video and navigational data confiscated .
They have not been questioned nor will they be , yet they violently attacked my ship and crew in the Southern Ocean .
Does the law only go to bat for those who destroy nature ’s creation ? ”

Britain is facing its worst financial crisis for more than a century , surpassing even the Great Depression of the 1930s , one of Gordon Brown 's most senior ministers and confidants has admitted .
In an extraordinary admission about the severity of the economic downturn , Ed Balls even predicted that its effects would still be felt 15 years from now .
The Schools Secretary 's comments carry added weight because he is a former chief economic adviser to the Treasury and regarded as one of the Prime Ministers 's closest allies .
Mr Balls said yesterday : " The reality is that this is becoming the most serious global recession for , I 'm sure , over 100 years , as it will turn out . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
He warned that events worldwide were moving at a " speed , pace and ferocity which none of us have seen before " and banks were losing cash on a " scale that nobody believed possible " .
The minister stunned his audience at a Labour conference in Yorkshire by forecasting that times could be tougher than in the depression of the 1930s , when male unemployment in some cities reached 70 per cent .
He also appeared to hint that the recession could play into the hands of the far right .
" The economy is going to define our politics in this region and in Britain in the next year , the next five years , the next 10 and even the next 15 years , " Mr Balls said .
" These are seismic events that are going to change the political landscape .
I think this is a financial crisis more extreme and more serious than that of the 1930s , and we all remember how the politics of that era were shaped by the economy . "
Philip Hammond , the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury , said Mr Balls 's predictions were " a staggering and very worrying admission from a cabinet minister and Gordon Brown 's closest ally in the Treasury over the past 10 years " .
He added : " We are being told that not only are we facing the worst recession in 100 years , but that it will last for over a decade – far longer than Treasury forecasts predict . "
The minister 's comments came as the Chancellor , Alistair Darling , admitted the global economy was " seeing the most difficult economic conditions for generations " .
Writing in today 's Independent , Mr Darling said his plans for shoring up Britain 's finances included " measures to insure against extreme losses " as well as separating out impaired assets into a " parallel financial vehicle " .
Unemployment figures out tomorrow are expected to show the number of people out of work has passed two million .
The Bank of England 's quarterly inflation report , also released tomorrow , is expected to include a gloomy forecast for economic growth .
Yesterday , the Financial Services Authority warned that the recession " may be deeper and more prolonged than expected " , adding that the global financial system had " suffered its greatest crisis in more than 70 years " .
Speaking to Labour activists in Sheffield , Mr Balls conceded that the Government must share some of the blame because it had failed properly to control the banks .
But he accused the Tories of blocking Labour 's attempts to tighten financial rules .

He said : " People are quite right to say that financial regulation was n't tough enough in Britain and around the world , that regulators misunderstood and did not see the nature of the risks of the dangers being run in our financial institutions – absolutely right . "
The other great depressions
* Long Depression , 1873–96
Precipitated by the " panic of 1873 " crisis on Wall Street and a severe outbreak of equine flu ( Karl Benz 's first automobile did not chug on to the scene until 1886 ) , it was remarkable for its longevity as well as its global reach .
In Britain , it was the rural south rather than the rich cities of the north that suffered .
The UK ceased to be a nation that relied in any way on farming for its livelihood .
* Great Depression , 1930s
The " Hungry Thirties " were rough on many , at a time when welfare systems were rudimentary .
The worst period was from the Wall Street Crash of 1929 to about 1932 , but in places such as Jarrow , the unemployment rate hardly dipped below 50 per cent until the economy was mobilised in 1940 .
However , for many in the south and for the middle classes , the times were relatively prosperous .
It ’s christmas , baby , and do we have a present for you .
We ’re ending the bickering between Merb and Rails with a this bombshell : Merb is being merged into Rails 3 !
We all realized that working together for a common good would be much more productive than duplicating things on each side of the fence .
Merb and Rails already share so much in terms of design and sensibility that joining forces seemed like the obvious way to go .
All we needed was to sit down for a chat and hash it out , so we did just that .
What this will mean in practice is that the Merb team is putting their efforts into bringing all of the key Merb ideas into Rails 3 .
Yehuda Katz will outright join the Rails core team , Matt Aimonetti will work on a new evangelism team , and Carl Lerche and Daniel Neighman ( hassox ) will be co-starring the effort to bring all this over .
We ’ve immortalized the merge with plaque page at rubyonrails.org / merb .
What ’s being brought over ?
Some of the key ideas that they ’ll be taking with them from Merb into Rails 3 are :
Rails core : Yes , Rails is a full - stack framework and will remain so , but there ’s no reason we should n’t also make it possible to run with less than the full monty .
Rails 3 will make it easy to run just a bare minimum and then allow you to opt in just the stuff you want , if that ’s necessary for your particular situation .
Think “ rails myapp — core ” ( and “ rails myapp — flat ” ) .
Performance optimizations : Merb has a lot of Rails pieces rewritten to be faster .
We ’ll be bringing all that good stuff over .
We ’ll also bend the architecture in the places where that ’s necessary for a big yield .
In short , Rails 3 will get all the performance attention that the Merb guys are known for .
Framework agnosticism : Rails will always have a default answer to every question within the stack .
If you do n’t care about testing frameworks , you ’ll get test / unit .
If you do n’t care about which ORM , you ’ll get Active Record .
But some people do care and want something else .
Some people want RSpec for testing , others want to use Sequel or Data Mapper for ORM , others again prefer Haml for templating , and some might prefer jQuery for Ajax .
All these people should feel like Rails is welcoming them with open arms .
Yes , we ’ll have a default , but we should n’t have any form of discrimination against alternatives .
Rigorous API : Too many plugins break when Rails is updated because it ’s not clear where they can safely hook into the internals and when they ’re monkeypatching and should expect things to break .
The Merb guys committed to a public API with tests to ensure that it would n’t break .
They ’ll bring over that line of thinking and give Rails 3 a tested and documented API for extensions that wo n’t break willy - nilly with upgrades .
This is not a big bang rewrite
It ’s important to understand , however , that this is not a “ big bang ” rewrite of Rails .
We ’re far beyond the time when we could just throw out everything and start over .
This is going to be a progressive improvement of Rails that ’ll carefully judge new initiatives on their impact on backwards compatibility as well as their general utility .
I ’m sure there ’ll be some parts of Rails 3 that are incompatible , but we ’ll try to keep them to a minimum and make it really easy to convert a Rails 2.x application to Rails 3 .
The Merb guys will also be working hard on giving existing Merb users a manageable upgrade path to Rails 3 .
We ’re working with lots of ideas including allowing existing Merb controllers to be mounted alongside new Rails 3 ones .
We ’ll see how it all plays out , but play out it will .
Also , the Merb guys are n’t just abandoning the existing Merb user base and their applications .
They ’ll still be doing bug fixes , security fixes , and work on easing the upgrade path to Rails 3 .
This will all progress in a nice , orderly fashion .
The timeline
Rails 2.3 is just around the corner .
We hope to wrap up and release in January .
It ’s a blockbuster release packed with goodies to the tilt .
But as soon as that ’s done , all eyes will be on Rails 3 .
The probably - overly - optimistic goal is to have at least a beta version ready for RailsConf 2009 in Las Vegas .
Who knows if we ’ll make it , but we ’ll certainly have made tons of progress on it by then .
So all of these changes are pretty much effective immediately .
We ’ve already started the collaboration and we ’ll be rolling out a bunch of public initiatives announcing the concrete elements of the work under the Rails 3 milestone very shortly .
No hard feelings , just kumbaja
This is quite a dramatic turn of events .
We went from testy relations to coming together in not very long at all .
But I ’ve been incredibly positively surprised at how well everyone on both sides have been gelling behind the scenes .
The more we talk , the more we realize that we want the same things .
And in the few cases were we do care about something different , it ’s usually complimentary .
I really hope that everyone within both communities will deal with this news as gracefully as the key contributors from both camps .
Let ’s just wipe the slate clean on anything that has gone before and cherish that we can now move forward in unity instead of as fractions of the same ideas .
Rails 3 is going to kick ass .

" The Breathing Wall " : Control Yourself !
With Fiction !
Novelist Kate Pullinger , Stefan Schemat , and Chris Joseph ( " babel " ) have created an electronic book called " The Breathing Wall " that has a unique gimmick : you read it while wearing a microphone , and the book 's software only allows you to penetrate deeper into the story as a result of your controlled breathing rhythms .
The book measures how relaxed you stay during the course of the story , and the more slowly and carefully that you breathe , the deeper you go into story 's animated dream sequences that contain mysterious clues to exchanges in the written and spoken segments .
From the book 's website , where you can read a free sample : " The Breathing Wall " is the story of a man named Michael who is sent to prison for the murder of his ex-girlfriend , Lana .
Lana was killed the day after they broke up , and in her pocket was an angry note from him which the police used to build a case against him .
However , while staring at the walls of his prison cell , Michael begins to have conversations with Lana 's ghost , who puts him touch with her sister , Florence .
Together , Florence and Michael discover clues to help find the real killer and get Michael out of prison .
Pullinger 's other works include " When the Monster Dies , " " Where Does Kissing End ? , " " Weird Sister , " " The Last Time I Saw Jane , " and " Inanimate Alice , " a series of online , animated stories about a girl growing up in Northern China .
" The Breathing Wall " sounds like a promising story , but the development of the Hyper Trance Fiction Matrix biofeedback system makes me wonder what other stories could be told using the same technology .
Like ... Or maybe ...
Or what about ... And for kids ... Who 's that breathing on the other end of my telephone line ?
Is that you , genius ?
Just because the expense - account lunch is largely a thing of the past does n’t mean that you ca n’t still enjoy the meal , even celebrate it .
Instead of depending on the kindness of menus , use a little homespun imagination .
Thinking outside the lunch box is probably the best way of getting anything good inside it .
In the comfort of your own kitchen , you can compose a lunch that ’s tasty , well - constructed , a bit off the beaten PB&J track -- and , most important , portable .
Imagine that you ’re packing a picnic .
Lunch is more fun if you think pragmatically .
You do n’t have to have seen Monty Python ’s “ The Meaning of Life ” to know not to pack items that might pose a health risk .
Avoid fragile things like delicate cookies and , yes , potato chips .
Do n’t dress salads in advance -- carry a container of dressing separately -- and do n’t pre-cut fruits or vegetables that will brown or dry out -- pack them whole and include a paring knife .
Even if you use a Thermos , do n’t include items that need to be served very hot or very cold .
And think about how the components of the meal work together over time :
Very few dishes taste better when they ’re soggy .
One that does is a pan bagnat , a pressed baguette sandwich that actually gets better the longer it sits .
Take a tip from bakers and South American street vendors and make a batch of empanadas , a tasty one - dish meal enclosed within whole - wheat pastry .
Or use a Thermos and have hot soup for lunch .
For dessert , pack a piece of ripe fruit or a handful of grapes ; add a bar of 70 % chocolate or some biscotti .
And to drink , instead of grabbing soda from a vending machine , decant some fizzy water into a reusable bottle and add a few slices of lime , blend a quick smoothie or even pack a small bottle of wine ( when appropriate ) .
A carton of milk , anyone ?
A few tips to think about :
Pack smart so that the contents of your lunch do n’t get squashed or leak .
Use recyclable containers , or better , containers that you take home and reuse .
Pick food that can withstand a few hours without refrigeration ( or include an ice pack ) .
And remember that aesthetics count : Both school kids and adults are more likely to eat and enjoy their lunch when it looks appealing , so packaging things well is worth a little extra time .
Finding a cool - looking lunchbox is worth it too .
Score a retro lunchbox at a vintage shop , find an outdoorsy pack at a store like REI or L.L. Bean ( they ’re often insulated and double as great camping gear ) , or surf the Web for something fun on EBay or www.lunchboxes.com.
Although paper bags have an old - fashioned panache , they tend to tear easily and can break under the weight of heavy contents .
Here are some ideas for what to pack for lunch ( sorry , no bologna or PB&J ) :
1 . A pan bagnat sandwich , wrapped in plastic and parchment or waxed paper .
2 . A dandelion greens and goat cheese empanada ( or two ) .
3 . Fill a small Thermos with black bean and chorizo soup , then add a small container of salsa verde and a bag of cumin toasts .
4 . Pack your own charcuterie plate in a box by wrapping up slices of your favorite salumi : prosciutto , Spanish chorizo , maybe some jamón serrano or even lomo if you can find it .
Then add a little container of cornichons , another of whole - grain mustard and some slices of baguette .
5 . A crusty baguette , thinly sliced jambon de bayonne , some sweet butter and a little Maldon sea salt .
6 . The night before , make a batch of calzones filled with burrata and tomatoes .
Add a container of fresh pesto for dipping .
7 . Make simple spring rolls by rolling up in rice paper romaine lettuce , julienned carrot and daikon , grilled tofu ( or cooked shrimp if you have the option to refrigerate your lunch ) and some fresh mint and basil .
Pack a container of peanut sauce for dipping .
8 . Even if you do n’t have a Thermos you can still have soup for lunch :
Make some gazpacho , which is great at room temperature .
Pack slices of avocado , some cilantro and a small container of sour cream or yogurt .
9 . Pack a lunch with a Middle Eastern spin :
Include small containers of hummus and baba ghanouj , pita toasted with a bit of cumin , a container of diced tomatoes and cucumbers , and some good marinated olives .
10 .
To go with a sliced bagel , include fillings packed separately so the bagel does n’t get soggy : a container of cream cheese ( mix in some chopped chives , freshly ground black pepper , minced cilantro or capers ) , slices of red onion and cucumber and some lox or smoked salmon .
11 . Make a big frittata ( using chard and goat cheese ) the night before -- with salad , a lovely dinner -- then pack a large slice of it for lunch the next day .
Include a small container of diced tomatoes to sprinkle on top .
12 . Chilled soba noodles , a container of dipping sauce , some minced nori and a handful of scallions .
13 . Mix up a big batch of lentil salad the night before ( it can last you throughout the week , as can many soups ) : Cook French green or beluga lentils , add some chopped parsley , crumbled feta cheese , sherry vinaigrette and black pepper to taste .
Pack a handful of mâche or arugula separately and stir into the salad just before eating .
14 . Breakfast for lunch : pack a Thermos of plain Greek yogurt , a container of granola , a little jar of honey , a bag of fresh berries and maybe a shaker of cinnamon .
15 .
Throw extra vegetables ( sliced bell peppers , red onions , zucchini , eggplant ) on the fire some night when you ’re grilling dinner , then make a pressed sandwich with the grilled vegetables , goat cheese mixed with fresh herbs , and a balsamic vinaigrette .
16 . Make a batch of empanadas ( No. 2 ) , but add sliced ham and grated Gruyère to the filling instead of dandelion greens .
17 . Compose a cheese plate in your lunchbox : Wrap a wedge of three of your favorite cheeses -- Manchego , a chevre , maybe smoked Gouda , probably not a blue considering the closed environment -- then add half a baguette , an apple or pear and a handful of Marcona almonds .
Be sure to include a cheese knife .
18 . For a retro lunch , fill a Thermos with tomato soup , wrap up a cheese panini or grilled cheese sandwich ( thinly sliced country white bread ; half Gruyère , half Fontina ; a smear of whole grain mustard ) , add a Granny Smith apple and a spoon .
19 .
Try making onigiri , “ the PB&J of Japan , ” for lunch : Form a ball of sushi rice around an umeboshi ( pickled plum ) or crab salad , then wrap with nori ( seaweed ) .
Or consider packing the nori separately and do the wrapping just before you eat , so the seaweed does n’t get soggy .
20 . Vary No. 14 by mixing a cup of muesli with milk and , if it ’s not already in the muesli , some golden raisins and toasted almonds .
Sprinkle sliced strawberries or a handful of blackberries on top .
By lunchtime , the muesli will have absorbed the milk and be beautifully creamy in texture .
21 . Pasta salad idea No. 1 : farfalle pasta , halved cherry tomatoes , feta cheese , fresh parsley , torn basil and toasted pine nuts .
22 . Cook up a stack of crepes the night before or even days ahead of time ( they freeze nicely too , separated by wax paper ) .
Wrap up three or four of them , and pack with a container of sautéed apples and a few slices of prosciutto .
23 .
For a tasty salad that wo n’t wilt , pack a plastic bag of mixed greens , add separate containers of toasted walnuts and crumbled blue or goat cheese , a little jar of vinaigrette ( walnut oil , sherry vinegar , a bit of mustard , salt and pepper ) .
Then add a whole pear and a cutting knife ; assemble at lunchtime .
24 . Grill or roast salmon for dinner .
Use leftovers ( or make extra ) and flake the cooked salmon into a container with cooked small potatoes , quartered cooked eggs , cooked beets , minced fresh dill and a mustard vinaigrette .
25 . Pasta salad idea No. 2 : penne , buffalo mozzarella , arugula - almond pesto , a handful of fresh arugula and toasted almonds .
26 . Roast and peel whole bell peppers the night before ( maybe while grilling ) .
Stuff the peppers with a mixture of tuna , capers , red onion and parsley .
Wrap in parchment for easier eating .
27 .
Make extra meatballs when you serve spaghetti and meatballs for dinner .
Reheat the sauce the next morning , then pack four or five meatballs into a Thermos and cover with tomato sauce .
Pack with a container of freshly grated Parmesan and a fork .
28 .
An apple , a container of almond butter to spread on the apple , raisins and spiced almonds .
29 . Vary No. 23 by including with the bag of greens containers of feta cheese , diced tomatoes and cucumbers , Kalamata olives , and a red wine vinaigrette .
30 .
Make a big pot of white bean chili for dinner .
The next morning , reheat some extra for the Thermos , pack with fresh cilantro , avocado and toasted croutons .
31 . Make a pressed sandwich with cilantro - walnut pesto and buffalo mozzarella .
32 . Pasta salad idea No. 3 : orecchiette with sautéed mushrooms , cooked beans ( borlotti , great Northern , or Christmas Lima if you have them ) and minced sage .
Pack a container of grated or shaved Parmesan .
33 .
Make extra wild rice on a night when you ’re having it for dinner , then mix the cooked rice with toasted hazelnuts or pine nuts , pomegranate seeds , fresh herbs and a little olive oil and sherry vinegar .
34 . Stuff a whole - wheat pita with falafel .
Add separate containers of finely chopped romaine , tomato and cucumbers , and tahini dressing to assemble at lunchtime .
35 . Pack a few flatbreads with a container of white bean hummus , another of sautéed greens and a shaker of Aleppo or cayenne pepper .
Either assemble into a sandwich at lunch , or just dip the bread into the hummus and eat the greens with a fork .
36 .
Make homemade veggie sushi with a bowlful of sushi rice , some sheets of nori and slices of carrots , cucumbers and tofu .
Pack chopsticks and some soy sauce packets .
Include wasabi and pickled ginger if you have any .
37 .
Pack some toasted baguette slices with a container of fava bean purée , another of Greek yogurt ( add a little sea salt ) and a plastic bag of fresh cilantro .
38 . Make a pressed sandwich with fresh burrata , heirloom tomatoes and lots of fresh basil .
39 .
After dinner , take leftover bread , tear it into pieces and toast it in olive oil with garlic and a few minced chiles .
The next morning , put the croutons in a plastic bag with chopped tomatoes , red onion and minced fresh herbs ( the flavors will blend and the croutons will soften ) .
In another bag , put salad greens .
At lunch , mix the contents for panzanella( Italian bread salad ) .
40 .
Make a batch of roasted red pepper soup the night before .
Pack ( hot or chilled ) into a Thermos with a container of Greek yogurt , a shaker of sumac or Aleppo pepper and a sprig of fresh mint .
And on some days -- if you ’ve made a really good batch of empanadas , say , or a pot of soup you ’re particularly proud of -- maybe make enough for two and offer to share your lunch with a friend or co-worker .
Turn on some music and unfold the napkins .
Sometimes lunchboxes can fit a lot more than lunch inside .

For the first time , astronomers have measured light emitted from extrasolar planets around sun-like stars using ground - based telescopes .
The observations were obtained simultaneously and independently by two separate teams for two different planets .
Incredibly , they were also able to determine properties of the exoplanets ’ atmospheres as well .
Measuring the light emitted from a planet at different wavelengths reveals the planet ’s spectrum , which can be used to determine the planet ’s day - side temperature .
In addition , this spectrum can reveal many physical processes in the planet ’s atmosphere , such as the presence of molecules like water , carbon monoxide and methane , and the redistribution of heat around the planet .
“ This first direct detection of light emitted by another planet , using existing telescopes on the ground , is a major milestone in the study of planets beyond our own Solar System , ” said Professor Gary Davis , Director of the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ( UKIRT ) .
“ This is a very exciting scientific discovery . ”
The measurements of the first planet , TrES - 3b , were conducted by a team of Astronomers from the University of Leiden , using the William Herschel Telescope ( WHT ) on La Palma ( Canary Islands , Spain ) and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawai`i .
TrES - 3b is in a very tight orbit around its host star , TrES - 3 , transiting the stellar disk once per 31 hours .
For comparison , Mercury orbits the sun once every 88 days .
TrES - 3b is just a little larger than Jupiter , yet orbits around its parent star much closer than Mercury does , making it a “ hot jupiter . ”
UKIRT observations caught the planet transiting in front of the star , from which the size of the planet has been worked out extremely precisely .
The WHT observations also show the moment the planet moves behind the star , and allow the strength of the planet light to be measured .
Astronomers have been trying to observe this effect from the ground for many years , and this is the first success .
Ernst de Mooij , leader of the research team , said , “ While a few such observations have been conducted previously from space , they involved measurements at long wavelengths , where the contrast in brightness between the planet and the star is much higher .
These are not only the first ground - based observations of this kind , they are also the first to be conducted in the near - infrared , at wavelengths of 2 micron for this planet , where it emits most of its radiation . ”
The researchers determined the temperature of TrES - 3b to be a slightly over 2000 Kelvin .
“ Since we know how much energy it should receive by the type of its host star , this gives us insights into the thermal structure of the planet ’s atmosphere , ” added Dr. Ignas Snellen , “ which is consistent with the prediction that this planet should have a so - called ‘ inversion layer . ’
It is absolutely amazing that we can now really probe the properties of such a distant world ” .
An atmospheric inversion layer is a layer of air where the normal change of temperature with altitude reverses .
Current theory says that there are two types of “ hot jupiters , ” one with an inversion layer , and one without .
One theory is that the presence of an inversion layer would depend on the amount of light the planet receives from its star .
If the inversion layer could be confirmed , for example by measurements at other wavelengths , these observations would fit in perfectly with this theory .
A second team has made a ground - based detection of a different extrasolar planet , OGLE - TR - 56 b , using the Southern Observatory ’s Very Large Telescope .
This planet is about 5,000 light - years away , located towards the center of the galaxy .
The planet is quite hot ; its atmosphere is more than 4,400 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2,400 degrees Celsius ) .
This is one of the hottest extrasolar planets detected .
The researchers say both landmark observations will open up a new window for studying exoplanets and their atmospheres using ground - based telescopes , and show great promise for using future extremely large telescopes which will have much higher sensitivity than the telescopes used today .

Demonstrators greeted health bosses in Southampton
Should we fear fluoride in water ?
Fluoride will be added to tap water in Southampton after health bosses voted through the plans despite protests .
It is the first time a health trust in England , rather than water companies , has been allowed to introduce fluoridation under new laws .
The idea has proved controversial with 72 % of 10,000 respondents in a public consultation opposing the plan .
Despite the opposition , the South Central Strategic Health Authority ( SCSHA ) unanimously backed the move .
Southampton City Council was in favour , but Hampshire County Council was against the plan , which is designed to cut tooth decay and which will affect 200,000 people .
Jim Easton , the SCSHA chief executive , said : " We recognise that water fluoridation is a contentious issue for some people .
" The board was satisfied that , based on existing research , water fluoridation is a safe and effective way to improve dental health . "
I think it is absolutely disgraceful , they have refused to listen to all the evidence we have given them

The SCSHA will now write to Southern Water instructing the firm to increase levels of fluoride from a natural 0.08 part per million to one part per million .
The Southampton City Primary Care Trust ( PCT ) said more than 40 % of children in the area were suffering from tooth decay and the increase was desperately needed .
Bob Deans , chief executive for the PCT , said : " We are very pleased that following an extensive public consultation , SCSHA has decided to introduce a water fluoridation scheme . "
The SCSHA said the problem of tooth decay among children and adults in Southampton was worse than the national average across England , despite a number of public health measures that have already been adopted in the city .
But opponents claim fluoride has negative effects on the body and vowed to contest the decision in the courts .
John Spottiswoode , chairman of Hampshire Against Fluoridation , said : " I think it is absolutely disgraceful , they have refused to listen to all the evidence we have given them .
" They have ignored the will of the people - 72 % did n't want it and yet they still are going to do it .
It is deeply unethical .
" We think it 's illegal and are thinking what we do next , maybe taking it to the courts in Europe . "

WARNING : 99 % of All Recycled Cell Phones Contain Owner 's Private Data
January 31st , 2009 by Jerry James Stone
[ social_buttons ]
In a sampling of two thousand recycled mobile phones , 99 percent were found to have sensitive data like banking information and confidential emails .
The sampling was done by Regenersis .
They processed over 2 million handsets in 2008 ; that ’s one handset every 15 seconds .
During a random sampling in December they discovered how many mobiles had not been wiped clean : a lot !
The average cell phone is replaced every 18 months .
And hot numbers like the iPhone and Google ’s Android are making smart phones even more ubiquitous .
We ’ve all heard about President Obama ’s BlackBerry addiction , yes ?
This means your cell phone ’s new owner has access to all of your user names and passwords , or ever worse … your Twitter account .
“ Data clearance of these handsets is critical to ensure the security of those who entrust their unwanted mobiles to us , ” said Mark Franklin , managing director of Regenersis .
While wiping personal data is a service some recyclers do offer , it ’s likely a two minute process to do it yourself .
Some programs even suggest that you remove the SIM card before recycling your phone .
“ Our advice to consumers is to check with the recycling firm to confirm that all data will be removed , ” he said .
“ If it does n’t , then think twice before sending them your handset as your data could end up in the wrong hands . ”
But this could all be a moot point .
Here in the US , there are approximately 700 million obsolete phones stockpiled at homes instead of being donated or recycled .
Yah , we just rock like that .

Amongst Linux users , there ’s a shared feeling that any Linux OS is superior by far to anything Microsoft produces .
More often than not , I also notice a frustration that the rest of the world does n’t know / acknowledge / cares about this .
There ’s a lot of talk about converting people to Linux , and the best way to do that .
But actually , it ’s very easy .
Here are some tips .
Make sure you ’re comfortable with Linux .
A new user of Linux will need support , just as sure as a new user of Windows will .
The difference is , with Linux , you ’ll have to be the support .
You ca n’t simply say “ Oh that problem ?
Yeah it ’s common .
I have no idea how to fix it ” , because the new user can’t simply bring his PC to the shop and ask them to repair it .
If you have n’t spent at least a year with some kind of Linux distribution , do n’t bother to convert others .
They ’ll end up hating you , their PC , and worst of all , Linux .
Refuse to do any Windows support .
This may seem harsh , but I noticed that the more I learned about operating systems and computers in general , the more people I knew grew to rely on me for their tech - support .
I do n’t mind helping out my friends , but anyone who ever was in my situation knows what the number one complaint of Windows users is : “ My PC has become very slow ” .
The reason ?
No firewall , no virusscanner , and clicking everything they see in Internet Explorer .
Fixing that more often that not requires a re-install , which is slow , boring work .
Furthermore , the more I used Linux , the less familiar I became with Windows .
I have n’t done any problem - solving in XP since SP2 , and I have no experience whatsoever with Vista .
Beyond the very basic , I wo n’t be able to help anyway , and if I have to start using google …well , people can do that themselves , ca n’t they 😉
There are a couple of people I know who use Linux , and I ’m always more than happy to help them .
Funny thing is , most of the time , any problems they might have are fixed in five minutes or less .
Do n’t take the first step .
Simply put , if people are happy using Windows , why bother ?
For most people , the OS they ’re running on their PC is completely unimportant , so the choice between Windows and Linux is irrelevant .
Singing the praises of Linux over and over again will only make them hate you , and more importantly , Linux .
Of course , most people using Windows are n’t happy with it at all .
I have no doubt that there are enough people who keep their Windows PC absolutely virusfree and in great shape , but their number is dwarfed by others who have no idea what “ maintenance ” means , and could benefit from using another OS .
What I ’ve noticed is , if those people notice you ’re happily running Linux , which can be easier , faster , safer and better looking than Windows , they get curious .
If they take the first step , and if you help them with the others , converting them can be very easy indeed .
To finish , I ’ll give you two examples of what I mean .
My girlfriend is not a Linux convert .
She has a laptop with XP installed .
The problem is , the thing breaks down constantly .
Or she forgets the recharging cable .
Or there ’s another reason why she ca n’t use it , so my old PC has to come to the rescue .
Mostly , I use it to test new distributions , but for her I used a partition to install Arch and IceWm with a Vista theme , and everything else she might need like OpenOffice , Firefox and Emesene .
She ’s fine with it , partly because she knows I wo n’t put XP on it anyway , but mostly because she has no problem whatsoever using it .
In fact , the only reason why she ( sometimes ) says that Windows is better than Linux is because she knows it annoys me 😉
Another friend of mine is a full convert .
When Ubuntu Gutsy came out , she asked me to set up a dual boot for her , because she did n’t want to upgrade to Vista .
Most of the time , she still used XP , but for some things she used Ubuntu , because it was easier ( like FTP some files to her website , which was very easy in Nautilus ) .
When she bought a new computer with XP pre-installed , she asked me to transfer her files .
Also , she wanted her PC ready for daily use , because of course XP came without any software worth a damn .
I interpreted that as “ set up a dual boot again , and transfer all my settings ” , which took me something like 45 minutes , everything included .
I did n’t touch XP , and simply told her that I did n’t care what she used , but Ubuntu was prepped and ready .
If she wanted the XP install to offer the same functionality , she ’d have to call someone else .
She ’s been using Ubuntu ever since , with only one small apt - get problem which was fixed in a matter of minutes , with a little help from me on MSN Messenger .
So of course , the title of this article is a bit misleading .
There ’s no magical way to make people use Linux .
In fact , if they ’re happy with their XP , Vista , or OSX , there ’s no reason they should .
Personally , I wo n’t force Linux down anyone ’s throat , but I share the opinion of the people I mentioned at the beginning of this article : I do think many Linux distributions are superior to Windows , in terms of stability , speed , safety and even ease of use .
If people want to try it out , I ’m ready to help , and if they do n’t … well , that ’s more time I can spend tinkering with my own Linux box 😉

We Need A New Information - Sharing Model for the Internet
by Bruce Eckel
June 5 , 2005
Summary
We need a new model for sharing information , one that leverages the Internet in a way that scales .
Advertisement
I think that there are two ways that we locate information in a resource : search and structure .
In print books , search has always been a difficult approach , and this has been dramatically improved with the Web and electronic documents .
But structure is essential , especially when you do n't really know what you 're trying to find , or you are learning material for the first time .
You could argue that you can use search to discover information in a newsgroup , but as the data increases , it becomes much harder to track down the information because it tends to become very scattered .
If it were easy , it would cut way down on repeated questions and make the newsgroup a place that people would stay for much longer , rather than the usual response of fleeing when the noise level gets too high .
Structure is essential because it clumps information together , and presents it in a linear form so that a newcomer can absorb the information in the right order .
It is also the lowest - entropy form of information , and thus requires the most effort to produce .
Most information on the Internet lacks structure , and thus is difficult to use .
For a number of years I have been pondering whether it would be possible to create a self - structuring way of sharing information -- one that would naturally tend towards decreasing entropy as people added more to it .
I am hunting for the middle ground .
On one extreme is a newsgroup , which has all kinds of very good information but in an essentially linear form .
It has very little structure ( the best we 've seen is " threads " but these are only slightly helpful ) , and so as we 've seen again and again , it does n't scale .
Many people have talked about the phenomenon of a newsgroup being good at the beginning , but when you get too many people it loses its integrity and manageability .
Many newsgroups are full of good stuff but I can't handle the volume and the low signal - to - noise ratio so I do n't subscribe .
If a newsgroup had more structure , however , it could be extremely useful .
Information would aggregate in a structured fashion , so when people had questions or new ideas they would go where that information already was .
Newbie questions could be answered by navigating a tree , and when a topic came up it would be placed alongside the existing material in the tree , rather than repeating something over and over in a linear fashion , as is done with newsgroups .
Some newsgroups work better than others because they have a small group of mature and dedicated people that help keep things on track ( comp.lang .
python is an example of this ) .
But in general , newsgroups do n't scale because they are supposed to be a conversation among a relatively small group of people .
Weblogs scale because they simulate the " eyes forward " style of traditional lecturing .
You go to a lecture to hear a particular speaker .
With a weblog , lots of people can listen without the system breaking down , and there can be Q&A .
The structure of the discussion is around each article , so it 's less likely that people get off topic , and you can always just read the article and not the comments ( in a newsgroup you never know when you 'll find the real essence of the discussion , so you have to read endlessly ) .
The opposite extreme from the newsgroup is a zine .
This requires a lot of effort by experts .
Most experts already have too much to do , and can't simply add this task to their list .
So in this case , the effort is what does n't scale .
In pre-internet days , print magazines were the only outlet for less - than - book - sized ideas .
Writing for magazines required a lot of hassle and did n't usually pay well , but it paid something and you did it because that was the way to publicize ideas .
But with the net , you have many ways to publicize ideas .
The weblog requires a lot less effort .
" Less effort " is a form of payment .
If I want my ideas published , I could do it through a zine but that 's going to require a lot more time and effort than if I just publish it through a weblog .
Maybe I do n't know whether the idea is really worth publishing , and perhaps I just want to try it out .
And if I do have an idea worth publishing and am willing to do the work of putting it into article form , why not start thinking of a book ?
( or , note what Joel Spolsky is doing by collecting the best weblog entries of the year from all over the web , and publishing it as a book -- that 's a good idea because he acts as the filter so you do n't have to do all the work of finding those pieces yourself ) .
The internet is busting through the model of " he who owns the presses decides the news . "
With the Internet , we have alternative incentives .
However , the magazine model relies on three different forms of incentive :
You get your ideas out there .
The internet keeps coming up with more alternative ways to do this , more easily .
So this factor does n't work with a zine .
You get paid .
If you want high - caliber people to put in a lot of work , money is an important incentive .
You get an article reviewed and vetted by said high - caliber people .
This is the value / notoriety of association .
But without # 2 , those people are n't there .
That 's where the model falls apart -- most high - caliber people are already too busy with their own stuff to take on another task , especially one that involves donating their time , and especially when they have # 1 as an outlet .
That 's why I question the zine approach .
As an alternative , I keep imagining some kind of emergent way to produce structured information , where a lot of people can put in little bits of time , and everyone benefits from the result .
I do n't know the mechanism for such a thing , but the Internet is what would make it possible .
We need to explore the possibilities that the Internet provides , rather than trying to resurrect something from the pre-Internet world .
The wiki clearly has some elements of this .
It allows the participants to decide what the organization will be .
A wiki has a different feel than a newsgroup because the information is clearly persistent and there is supposed to be structure .
However , the wikis I 've seen end up suffering because everyone does n't have the same vision for what that structure should be .
Without something that keeps bringing the structure into focus , entropy results and it becomes harder and harder to find what you want .
It would be interesting to see what the scaling factor for a wiki is vs. a newsgroup -- how many active participants can a wiki support before it starts losing focus , and what is the same number for a newsgroup .
One approach that shows promise is the wikipedia .
The have a number of advantages on that project :
A clear , well - defined goal ( create an encyclopedia ) with a predefined structure Many volunteers , and a number of people ( if I understand correctly ) dedicated full - time to the project A vast number of consumers -- arguably everyone on the planet -- to justify the effort
Ironically , I think this shows that the wiki is not the ideal medium for a many - person discussion .
It requires the tremendous effort seen in the Wikipedia in order to keep the information organized .
Many of the basic ideas of the wiki are valid , however .
It allows a person to contribute a very small amount ( such as a spelling or grammar correction ) or a large amount ( such as maintaining the structure of an entire wiki ) .
It has relatively easy entry points .
It 's possible to create a structured document with automatic table of contents .
To maintain the clarity of a wiki , however , requires one or more editors dedicated to the job , who have the vision of what the document should look like .
For a quality document , I think that editing is essential , but my hope is that we can develop a system that would allow one or more of the following :
The computer participates in the editing process ( at least the structuring )
The amount of effort by the editor is reduced
The editing process is distributed among some of the volunteers
The system allows the structure to be an emergent property of the document
Although I have made attempts at some of these features ( for example , I was largely responsible for the " Backtalk " feature that you see in the online version of the Zope book ) , I do n't really know how all this could be accomplished .
But I 'm reasonably certain that the model for the " self - organizing book " would be one of the Next Big Things on the Internet .

Muntadhir Al - Zaidi , the Egyptian shoe - throwing journalist being held in an Iraqi prison for throwing his shoes at President Bush during his recent visit to Iraq has , according to his brother , who recently visited him in prison , been tortured .
As a result :
Uday al - Zaidi said his brother had said : “ After the torture and the cold - water shower , I told them to bring me a blank sheet of paper and I would sign it , and they could write whatever they wanted .
I am ready to say I am a terrorist or whatever you want . ”
While tempting , we should not dismiss the repeated beatings of al - Zaidi as acts of lone interrogators .
Torture has been a hallmark of the U.S. - led War on Terror since at least as early as 2002 , when Guantanamo Bay opened .
Detainees there are held in extreme isolation , without contact with outside family members or lawyers ; blindfolded ; subjected to “ stress positions ” ; sleep - deprived ; exposed to loud music and extreme temperatures .
Torture , after all , is not simply the infliction of physical pain — it involves separating the victim from reality , denying their individuality and breaking them down completely in the hopes that they might admit to an alleged wrongdoing .
Often , however , as in al - Zaidi ’s case , the victim will be willing to say anything to make the torture might stop .
This is the point that people often miss about why governments ( including ours ) use torture .
It ’s not that we really believe we ’re getting sound information .
Those who are tortured are often willing to say anything at all , even confessing to crimes that they did not commit , in the hopes that the torture will cease .
Governments then take those sham confessions and hold them up to “ prove ’ that the torture was effective and that a criminal had been outted .
That ’s what Hitler did ; it ’s what Stalin did ; it ’s what North Korea still does .
And now , apparently , it ’s what the U.S. - backed Iraqi government does .
And that , of course , is to say nothing of the semi- documented cases of the U.S. ’s “ extraordinary rendition ” plan , in which American agents kidnap suspected terrorists from foreign countries and ship them to various countries around the world where US jurisdiction — and rules against torture — do not apply .
Detainees are held indefinitely and have no recourse to lawyers or to the Red Cross .
Many victims of this program claim to have been tortured , and in 2005 an Italian judged issued arrest warrants for 13 CIA agents relating to the alleged extraordinary rendition of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr from Italy to Egypt .
The U.S. brand of torture is not the result of poorly supervised low - level guards run amok .
The Senate Armed Services committee recently published a report that notes that the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib “ was not simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own , ” but , according to The New York Times , “ grew out of interrogation policies approved by Mr. Rumsfeld and other top officials . ”
That Iraqi interrogators would beat a man , accused only of throwing his shoes , so severely that he allegedly was ready to admit to being a terrorist , is hardly surprising given the close association between American forces and their Iraqi counterparts .
If Americans are willing to mistreat our own prisoners , why would we expect our Iraqi allies to treat theirs any differently ?
In his haste to explain away the beating , Iraq ’s Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki alleged that the mastermind behind the shoe attack was a “ person … known to us for slitting throats . ”
He declined to provide a name and did not elaborate any further .
But even if the “ confession ” happened , what can we say of a government that accepts such a confession and holds it up as justification for its violence ?
Torturing has never been about acquiring reliable information .
It ’s about cowing your opponents , real and / or imagined , into submission ; and it ’s about governments trying to legitimize oppressive tactics by conjuring fake confessions from battered inmates .
I hope , going forward , that the Obama administration can eliminate use of torture in its prosecution of the global War on Terror .
I ’m afraid that , in Iraq anyway , it might already be too late .

Lately , thereâs been a lot of questions about Jessica Simpsonâs weight gain .
Questions like :
Is she fat ?
How fat is she ?
How did she get so fat ?
And , wait , who 's Jessica Simpson again ? Â
Well , you might remember her as the once svelte singer and actress whose songs you do n't own and whose movies you havenât seen .
But more likely , you remember Jessica Simpson only as that naughty , barely legal piece of eye candy you could convince to have sex with you by promising a brand new unicorn and / or Travis Tritt tickets .
Well , times have changed and now everyoneâs talking about the new Jessica :
Yeah , but donât feel too bad .
True , she may have been called fat by many different people , but hordes of utterly unimportant celebrities have also rallied to Jessicaâs defense and castigated the media for this name - calling .
Over and over they plead their case : " Leave Jessica alone !
What kind of message is this sending to young girls everywhere ?â 
Well , I 'd like to take this opportunity to answer that question : Itâs sending a wonderful message !
Are you listening young ladies ?
The lesson is clear and true :
WHATEVER YOU DO , DONâT BE LIKE JESSICA SIMPSON !
Do you want to be ridiculed ?
Do you want to be unloved ?
Do you want to be mocked on the cover of national magazines ?
Perhaps , even by the
Researchers at an I.B.M. laboratory have captured a three - dimensional image of a biological virus using , for the first time , a technique that has some similarity to magnetic resonance imaging , a tool routinely used by physicians to peer inside the human body .
Although the technique is akin to M.R.I. , the results were 100 million times better in terms of resolution with the new technique , magnetic resonance force microscopy , or M.R.F.M.
The team of researchers , based at the computer maker ’s Almaden Research Center in San Jose , Calif. , reports in the The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they have captured a 3 - D image of a tobacco mosaic virus with a spatial resolution down to four nanometers .
Techniques like atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopes have provided images of individual atoms .
( An atom is about one - tenth of a nanometer in diameter ) .
But these techniques are more destructive of biological samples because they send a stream of electrons at the target in order to get an image .
And these microscopes cannot peer beneath the surface of the Lilliputian structures .
The researchers said that many of their ideas had evolved from earlier work on atomic force microscopes .
“ The one thing that has always intrigued me , is , can we take the same idea and do it in three dimensions ? ” said Daniel Rugar , an I.B.M. physicist who helped design the first M.R.F. microscope in 1993 .
“ We ’d like to be able to take pictures of atomic structures like molecules .
That ’s been our motivation . ”
The development of M.R.F.M. as a three - dimensional microscope actually began in 1991 with publication of a speculative paper by a theoretical physicist , John A. Sidles , who was then searching for new tools to help design drugs to combat the AIDS virus .
After reading about atomic force microscope research at I.B.M. , Dr. Sidles , who is a professor of orthopedics at the University of Washington School of Medicine , called Dr. Rugar and proposed a related tool that measured minute magnetic fields to construct images of biological structures .
Aligning filesystems to an SSD ’s erase block size
I recently purchased a new toy , an Intel X25 - M SSD , and when I was setting it up initially , I decided I wanted to make sure the file system was aligned on an erase block boundary .
This is a generally considered to be a Very Good Thing to do for most SSD ’s available today , although there ’s some question about how important this really is for Intel SSD ’s — more on that in a moment .
It turns out this is much more difficult than you might first think — most of Linux ’s storage stack is not set up well to worry about alignment of partitions and logical volumes .
This is surprising , because it ’s useful for many things other than just SSD’s .
This kind of alignment is important if you are using any kind of hardware or software RAID , for example , especially RAID 5 , because if writes are done on stripe boundaries , it can avoid a read - modify - write overhead .
In addition , the hard drive industry is planning on moving to 4096 byte sectors instead of the way - too - small 512 byte sectors at some point in the future .
Linux ’s default partition geometry of 255 heads and 63 sectors / track means that there are 16065 ( 512 byte ) sectors per cylinder .
The initial round of 4 k sector disks will emulate 512 byte disks , but if the partitions are not 4 k aligned , then the disk will end up doing a read / modify / write on two internal 4 k sectors for each singleton 4 k file system write , and that would be unfortunate .
Vista has already started working around this problem , since it uses a default partitioning geometry of 240 heads and 63 sectors / track .
This results in a cylinder boundary which is divisible by 8 , and so the partitions ( with the exception of the first , which is still misaligned unless you play some additional tricks ) are 4 k aligned .
So this is one place where Vista is ahead of Linux ….
unfortunately the default 255 heads and 63 sectors is hard coded in many places in the kernel , in the SCSI stack , and in various partitioning programs ; so fixing this will require changes in many places .
However , with SSD ’s ( remember SSD’s ?
This is a blog post about SSD ’s … ) you need to align partitions on at least 128 k boundaries for maximum efficiency .
The best way to do this that I ’ve found is to use 224 ( 32* 7 ) heads and 56 ( 8*7 ) sectors / track .
This results in 12544 ( or 256* 49 ) sectors / cylinder , so that each cylinder is 49 * 128 k .
You can do this by doing starting fdisk with the following options when first partitioning the SSD :
# fdisk - H 224 -S 56 / dev/sdb
The first partition will only be aligned on a 4 k boundary , since in order to be compatible with MS - DOS , the first partition starts on track 1 instead of track 0 , but I did n’t worry too much about that since I tend to use the first partition for / boot , which tends not to get modified much .
You can go into expert mode with fdisk and force the partition to begin on an 128 k alignment , but many Linux partition tools will complain about potential compatibility problems ( which are obsolete warnings , since the systems that would have booting systems with these issues have n’t been made in about ten years ) , but I did n’t needed to do that , so I did n’t worry about it .
So I created a 1 gigabyte / boot partition as / dev/sdb1 , and allocated the rest of the SSD for use by LVM as / dev/sdb2 .
And that ’s where I ran into my next problem .
LVM likes to allocate 192k for its header information , and 192k is not a multiple of 128k .
So if you are creating file systems as logical volumes , and you want those volume to be properly aligned you have to tell LVM that it should reserve slightly more space for its meta - data , so that the physical extents that it allocates for its logical volumes are properly aligned .
Unfortunately , the way this is done is slightly baroque :
# pvcreate –metadatasize 250k / dev/sdb2
Physical volume “ / dev/sdb2 ” successfully created
Why 250k and not 256k ?
I ca n’t tell you — sometimes the LVM tools are n’t terribly intuitive .
However , you can test to make sure that physical extents start at the proper offset by using :
# pvs / dev/sdb2 -o+ pe_start
PV VG Fmt Attr PSize PFree 1st PE
/ dev/sdb2 lvm2 — 73.52G 73.52G 256.00K
If you use a metadata size of 256 k , the first PE will be at 320 k instead of 256k .
There really ought to be an –pe - align option to pvcreate , which would be far more user - friendly , but , we have to work with the tools that we have .
Maybe in the next version of the LVM support tools … .
Once you do this , we ’re almost done .
The last thing to do is to create the file system .
As it turns out , if you are using ext4 , there is a way to tell the file system that it should try to align files so they match up with the RAID stripe width .
( These techniques can be used for RAID disks as well ) .
If your SSD has an 128 k erase block size , and you are creating the file system with the default 4 k block size , you just have to specify a strip width when you create the file system , like so :
# mke2fs -t ext4 - E stripe - width=32, resize=500G /dev/ssd/root
( The resize=500G limits the number of blocks reserved for resizing this file system so that the guaranteed number size that the file system can be grown via online resize is 500G .
The default is 1000 times the initial file system size , which is often far too big to be reasonable .
Realistically , the file system I am creating is going to be used for a desktop device , and I do n’t foresee needing to resize it beyond 500G , so this saves about a 50 megabytes or so .
Not a huge deal , but “ waste not , want not ” , as the saying goes . )
With e2fsprogs 1.41.4 , the journal will be 128k aligned , as will the start of the file system , and with the stripe - width specified , the ext4 allocator will try to align block writes to the stripe width where that makes sense .
So this is as good as it gets without kernel changes to make the block and inode allocators more SSD aware , something which I hope to have a chance to look at .
All of this being said , it ’s time to revisit this question — is all of this needed for a “ smart ” , “ better by design ” next - generation SSD such as Intel’s ?
Aligning your file system on an erase block boundary is critical on first generation SSD’s , but the Intel X25 - M is supposed to have smarter algorithms that allow it to reduce the effect of write - amplification .
The details are a little bit vague , but presumably there is a mapping table which maps sectors ( at some internal sector size — we do n’t know for sure whether it ’s 512 bytes or some larger size ) to individual erase blocks .
If the file system sends a series of 4 k writes for file system blocks 10 , 12 , 13 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 , followed by a barrier operation , a traditional SSD might do read / modify / write on four 128 k erase blocks — one covering the blocks 0 - 31 , another for the blocks 32 - 63 , and so on .
However , the Intel SSD will simply write a single 128 k block that indicates where the latest versions of blocks 10 , 12 , 13 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 96 , 97 , 98 , and 99 can be found .
This technique tends to work very well .
However , over time , the table will get terribly fragmented , and depending on whether the internal block sector size is 512 or 4 k ( or something in between ) , there could be a situation where all but one or two of the internal sectors on the disks have been mapped away to other erase blocks , leading to fragmentation of the erase blocks .
This is not just a theoretical problem ; there are reports from the field that this happens relatively easy .
For example , see Allyn Malventano ’s Long - term performance analysis of Intel Mainstream SSDs and Marc Prieur ’s report from BeHardware.com which includes an official response from Intel regarding this phenomenon .
Laurent Gilson posted on the Linux - Thinkpad mailing list that when he tried using the X25 - M to store commit journals for a database , that after writing 170 % of the capacity of an Intel SSD , the small writes caused the write performance to go through the floor .
More troubling , Allyn Malventano indicated that if the drive is abused for too long with a mixture of small and large writes , it can get into a state where the performance degredation is permanent , and even a series of large writes apparently does not restore the drive ’s function — only an ATA SECURITY ERASE command to completely reset the mapping table seems to help .
So , what can be done to prevent this ?
Allyn ’s review speculates that aligning writes to erase write boundaries can help —
I ’m not 100 % sure this is true , but without detailed knowledge of what is going on under the covers in Intel ’s SSD , we wo n’t know for sure .
It certainly can’t hurt , though , and there is a distinct possibility that the internal sector size is larger than 512 bytes , which means the default partitioning scheme of 255 heads / 63 sectors is probably not a good idea .
( Even Vista has moved to a 240 ⁄ 63 scheme , which gives you 8 k alignment of partitions ; I prefer 224 ⁄ 56 partitioning , since the days when BIOS ’s used C/H/S I /O are long gone . )
The Ext3 and Ext4 file system tend to defer meta - data writes by pinning them until a transaction commit ; this definitely helps , and ext4 allows you to configure an erase block boundary , which should also be helpful .
Enabling laptop mode will discourage writing to the disk except in large blocks , which probably helps significantly as well .
And avoiding fsync( ) in applications will also be helpful , since a cache flush operation will force the SSD to write to an erase block even if it is n’t completely filled .
Beyond that , clearly some experimentation will be needed .
My current thinking is to use a standard file system aging workload , and then performing an I/ O benchmark to see if there has been any performance degradation .
I can then vary various file system tuning parameters and algorithms , confirm whether or not a heavy fsync workload makes the performance worse .
In the long term , hopefully Intel will release a firmware update which adds support for ATA TRIM / DISCARD commands , which will allow the file system to inform the SSD that various blocks have been deleted and no longer need to be preserved by the SSD .
I suspect this will be a big help , if the SSD knows that certain sectors no longer need to be preserved , it can avoid copying them when trying to defragment the SSD .
Given how expensive the X25 - M SSD ’s are , I hope that there will be a firmware update to support this , and that Intel wo n’t leave its early adopters high and dry by only offering this functionality in newer models of the SSD .
If they were to do that , it would leave many of these early adopters , especially your humble writer ( who paid for his SSD out of his own pocket ) , to be quite grumpy indeed .
Hopefully , though , it wo n’t come to that .
Update : I ’ve since penned a follow - up post “ Should Filesystems Be Optimized for SSD’s ? ”
It has n't even been a month since Apple told the world that DRM on music sold in the iTunes Store would be going the way of the dodo and that all DRM - restricted music that we had purchased up until now could be upgraded to iTunes Plus — for a fee .
And not just the $ 0.30 per track fee it costs to upgrade each song .
As our own Erica Sadun pointed out after the announcement , upgrading your iTunes DRMed tracks was an all or nothing deal ; either you upgrade everything in your library , including those embarrassing Katy Perry songs that you bought while on a regrettable cough syrup bender , or none of your music at all .
Erica was n't the only one who brought up that concern , and thankfully , it seems as if Apple has listened to the feedback .
As of today , users can upgrade their songs to iTunes Plus on a song - by - song basis .
When you enter the iTunes Store and click on the iTunes Plus icon , you 're no longer restricted to the big , giant " Buy All " button .
Now , each track that Apple has identified as protected on your machine has a " Buy " button next to it .
You can now upgrade your songs on a per-song or even per-album basis , if that makes things easier for you .
Songs blurred to protect the guilty
Now , this does n't necessarily mean you should jump the gun if you do n't want to upgrade your stuff more than once .
Apple said that it plans to convert all 10 million songs on the iTunes Store to DRM - free by April , so that means not everything has been converted yet .
If you upgrade now , you may still have to upgrade other songs in the future .
Not that it matters anymore since you can do it a la carte , but if you 're the lazy type , keep waiting .
The island is about 900 yards off the coast at North Berwick Celebrity spoon - bender Uri Geller has bought a tiny Scottish island he believes has links to the pyramids at Giza and the Knights Templar .
Geller paid £ 30,000 for The Lamb , an uninhabited lump of volcanic rock in the Firth of Forth .
He claimed he felt a " strong instinctive urge " to buy it after reading it was for sale .
The self - proclaimed " mystifier " said he is convinced the island is one of the most significant sites in the UK .
The Lamb is the middle of three rocky islands - the others being Craigleith and Fidra - which are said to mirror the layout of the pyramids at Giza , in Egypt .
It is one of the keystones to British mythology , and I am thrilled to be its owner
Uri Geller
The island covers an area of just 100 yards by 50 yards .
Geller said : " I am fascinated by the connection between the pyramids and these islands .
" The connection has been known for centuries - you can read about it in a 15th century manuscript called the Scotichronicon by Walter Bower the Abbot of Inchcolm .
" So when I heard Lamb Island was for sale I felt a strong instinctive urge to buy it - and the more I delved into the history and the archaeological lore which surrounds it , the more certain I became that this is one of the most significant sites in Britain . "
The owner of the island is unlikely to gain planning consent to build on it as it is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area and has a colony of seabirds .
There are no landing facilities on the island , and access can only be gained by chartered boat - which can be hazardous as landing is only possible on the rocks .
Geller paid less than half the £ 75,000 asking price
The island was sold by Brazilian - born internet entrepreneur Camilo Agasim - Pereira , who owns the Barony of Dirleton .
He had been bequeathed it in 2002 , but had never set foot on it .
The asking price was £ 75,000 , but a figure of just £ 30,000 was settled on after negotiations .
" This island has links not only to the pyramids , but to King Arthur , King Robert the Bruce and to the ancient Kings of Ireland too , " Geller added .
" It might seem forbidding , and it is certainly uninhabitable , but it is one of the keystones to British mythology , and I am thrilled to be its owner .
" I might need a helicopter , but I am determined to set foot on my island soon . "

Julia Roberts just ca n’t seem to get away from the paparazzo .
The actress and her family moved to New Mexico to try and get out of the 24 - 7 lime light and that does n’t seem to be working either .
Pretty Woman star turned angry woman caught on tape when she encountered a female photographer who she claimed was stalking her .
Sources reported that Roberts sprang into defense to protect her children and the words just started coming out .
She yelled at the lady saying : “ You get the f … out of my face , do you understand me ?
“ You are harassing me .
Get the f… out of my face .
You have followed me all over town .
I have had it with you .
The photographer tried to apologizes , however Roberts yelled “ F … off !
Aim higher !
Get a life !
Get away from me ! ”
Guess that means apology not accepted do n’t you think ?

A teenage boy has been choked to death in a motorcycle accident on the NSW Central Coast , police say .
A passer - by raised the alarm about 11.30 am today when he found the 17 - year - old boy lying dead on a fire trail off Katara Road , at Warnervale .
Investigators believe a rope he was carrying across his shoulder became caught in the motorcycle chain and tightened around his neck , choking him to death .
Over the last few decades Italy has been transformed from a nation of emigrants to a target for mass immigration .
The change has brought severe political and social strains .
In the second part in a series from Italy , Aidan Lewis finds immigrants integrating against the odds in the northern city of Treviso .
At bus stops in Treviso there are the usual signs warning off fare - dodgers : " If you do n't pay , you do n't go , " they announce .
But these posters , promoted by the local anti-immigrant Northern League administration , are clearly aimed at a particular audience .
" If you have n't already understood , " the text continues in a parody of local Italian dialect , " I 'll tell you in Arabic " .
An Arabic translation duly follows .
There are other posters offering interpretation into French , for the city 's sizeable French - speaking African community .
This is a city where the Northern League deputy mayor , the " sheriff " of Treviso Giancarlo Gentilini , is being investigated for inciting racial hatred , and has said he did not want " black , brown or grey people teaching our children " .
Italy torn by racial strains
It hardly seems fertile ground for integration .
Yet the city and the surrounding region of the Veneto have some of the highest concentrations of immigrants in the country , and have won a reputation for integrating many of these relatively well .
Italy , where mass immigration only began in the 1990s , may seem mono-cultural to someone arriving from Britain or France .
But with a second generation of immigrants now emerging , there are signs that this is beginning to change .
Italian children
Those who arrived as immigration was taking off have been working here for well over a decade , and have been bringing up their children as Italians .
Fatmira Musaj , 40 , left Albania with her husband in 1991 , the day after their wedding .
She was among tens of thousands of Albanians who arrived in Italy that year , fleeing the turmoil that followed the collapse of the Communist regime .
Fatmira Musaj says life for immigrants has become a little easier Fatmira has two sons , aged six and 13 .
Both were born and brought up in Italy , both have Italian citizenship , and both were taught Italian so they could go to local schools .
" We spoke Italian at home , and they did n't have any problem , " says Fatmira , who lives in the town of Conegliano , north of Treviso .
" Now they have some trouble speaking Albanian .
They pronounce the words badly , like Italians . "
After arriving she found employment in metal work , which she describes as " a man 's job " .
In 2003 , she set up a small welding business .
Last year she and her husband opened a grocery shop that specialises in Eastern European products .
Like other immigrants here , Fatmira says has witnessed occasional hostility , and a frequent lack of openness .
Initially they called the store " Balkan shop " , but this seemed to scare people off , and Italian customers only started coming when she changed the name to " Euromarket " .
Like others she has stories about battling the vagaries and endless delays of Italian bureaucracy .
But like others , she also says life has gradually become easier and less isolated .
" This is partly because immigrants do all kinds of work now .
Not just the most humble ones , but also work in hospitals , homes , and with the elderly , " she says .
Mixed marriages People from Eastern European states are seen here as culturally closer to Italians and integrate more easily than others .
Even so , there is also evidence that other communities are slowly integrating .
It is common to see groups of teenage friends of mixed race , and occasionally mixed couples .
The new generation has qualifications , a degree or a diploma , and firms accept them more easily
Wang Yu , 27 There were 24,020 mixed marriages in 2006 , a tenth of total marriages and an increase of 143 % from a decade earlier .
Other figures pointing to more integration include a boom in immigrant entrepreneurs , and in those doing non-menial jobs .
Wang
Yu , 27 , says there has been an improvement since her father first arrived from China in 1987 .
" It was difficult for them to find work , " said Yu , who works in a bookshop , as a secretary , and as a waitress in a pizzeria , also in Conegliano .
" Now it 's a bit less so because the new generation has qualifications , a degree or a diploma , and firms accept them more easily . "
Abdellah Ayouguim , a Moroccan who runs an association that tries to improve links with local communities , says many of his fellow - countrymen - who until recently existed only on the very margins of Italian society - now feel Italian .
Immigrants play a visible role in jobs Italians no longer tend to take " Mentalities are changing because associations and centres are being created for integration , " he says .
But he adds that such projects often are unheralded because it is " always the ugly things that are noticed . "
Part of the reason for this , immigrants say , is the local strength of the Northern League , a partner in the centre - right Italian government since last April .
One of the party 's most outspoken and notorious politicians is Mr Gentilini , the Treviso 's deputy mayor .
He has called for a revolution " against gypsy and nomads camps " and " those who want to open mosques and Islamic centres " .
His office said last month he was not speaking to the press because of the investigation .
' Controlled ' immigration
The mayor , Gian Paolo Gobbo , acknowledges that there are " some immigrants who are very well integrated " .
" We are not against a controlled , specific kind of immigration , " he says .
" What we do n't want is the clandestine [ immigration ] , which goes hand in hand with criminality .
We need to say this clearly . "
Gian Paolo Gobbo says his party is responding to citizens ' concerns Mr Gobbo stresses that there have to be strict limits on arrivals at a time when many Italians are finding it hard to get work .
Northern Italy cannot be expected " to solve all the problems of the third world , " he says .
He also defends Mr Gentilini , saying that he was taking on board people 's complaints about immigrants .
" The citizens come and say to us - look , there they are camping out , they do n't have documents , they 're doing this and that , eat , [ relieve themselves ] - they do what they have to maybe behind or even in front of the church . "
But both in Treviso and nationally , analysts say there is often a gap between Northern League rhetoric and what the party is able or willing to implement in practice .
And while the League has drummed up the chorus of anti-immigrant sentiment , there are many in Treviso as elsewhere who try to cast immigrants in a more positive light .
Demographic problem Just outside Treviso is the headquarters of clothing company Benetton , which has built its name partly through multi-ethnic branding .
Benetton , with its multi-ethnic branding , is a major local company
As well as trying to promote itself through humanitarian projects like a micro-credit scheme in Senegal , the company has tried to engage with immigrant communities at home .
The church and the trade unions provide assistance to the hungry and the unemployed , while a range of cultural associations for immigrant communities have sprung up .
Though one local unionist caused a stir by calling for a block on further immigration because of Italy 's worsening economic position , others say that is alarmist .
" Despite what the politicians or commentators might think , it 's the labour market that regulates how many immigrants arrive , " says Franco Lorenzon , head of the local branch of the CISL union .
" Now if people go home , the message that there 's a slowdown will be understood , " he argues .
Even with growth contracting , he argues , immigrant labour will continue to be crucial because of Italy 's ageing population .
The labourers - evident in all walks of Italian life , from Egyptian pizza chefs to Ukrainian domestic helpers - keep an important part of the economy going , doing jobs that young Italian are no longer prepared to do .
" Here , it 's the immigrants who make the factories work , " says Mr Lorenzon .
" We have a demographic trend in which for every 10 people who retire , there are never 10 Italians to replace them .
" The youth of Treviso do n't want to work on a production line . "

I used to hate podcasts , but that did n't last long .
I got a longer commute , bandwidth became less of an issue and podcasts , frankly , got better .
Of course , I 'm a smidge biased .
I listen to a number of podcasts , not all technical , of course .
I also watch the nightly news and a number of other news and political TV shows delivered not over the air or via cable , but by podcast .
Here 's some technical podcasts , collected and recommended by my folks and friends on Twitter .
I 've heard some , and added my thoughts .
Others I look forward to listening to .
They are listed in no particular order .
I threw mine in there as well . ;)
NOTE : If you 've created a list of YOUR favorite .
NET Podcasts , send me a link to your blog and I 'll add it here :
And here 's mine :
Hanselman 's Super Karate Death Car List of .NET and Software Podcasts
Thoughtworks IT Matters - I respect a lot of the guys over at Thoughtworks so I 'll give this a listen just based on that .
It looks like it 's updated infrequently , and there 's no dates on their shows on the site ( the RSS includes them ) , so hopefully they 'll get a nice meter going and perhaps commit to a monthly or weekly schedule .
Looks promising and fairy platform - agnostic , so likely useful for anyone programming in any language .
Hanselminutes - I 'll let Scott Bellware 's tweeted review of my show speak , rather than toot my own horn : " the one i look forward to is hanselminutes .
know it ?
host is a bit of a nut , but ethical and with a heart : ) "
I 'm a .NET person , but I also dabble in Ruby and did some time at Nike coding Java .
I also like gadgets so the show has become all of the above plus ( I think ) interesting interviews .
. NET Rocks -
The first and longest running , now on show # 418 which is CRAZY .
Richard and Carl set the standard for those that followed them .
Often interviews , sometimes random , always interesting , .NET Rocks is the gold standard .
ALT.NET Podcast -
" You 're the type of developer who uses whatever works while keeping an eye out for a better way , you reach outside the mainstream to adopt the best of any community , you 're not content with the status quo and you realize that tools are great , but they only take you so far ... " this might be the podcast for you .
Sparkling Client - Entirely focused on Silverlight and RIA ( Rich Internet Application ) technologies , I 'd call this an " up and comer " in the .NET podcast world .
ASP.NET Podcast by Wally McClure -
The site design is a little wacky , but Wally 's got 130 + podcasts focused entirely on ASP.
NET and the content continues .
He has covered Azure , lots of ASP .
NET AJAX , jQuery and many other topics .
Polymorphic Podcast - Craig Shoemaker works for Infragistics and hosts this .NET focused podcast .
It 's a little spotty as far as the frequency of updates , but he has an easy style and focuses a lot of ASP .
NET .
He 's also had a couple of killer interviews like his one with craigslist founder Craig Newmark .
Herding Code - Hosted by K. Scott Allen , Kevin Dente , Scott Koon and Jon Galloway , this is kind of the TWiT of .NET podcasts .
If you ever wish you could go to coffee and shoot the sh*t with some really smart folks , but you just can't find enough find enough smart guys or enough coffee , look no farther than Herding Code .
Each host has a different perspective that adds to the conversation .
The sound quality and leveling can be a little off , but not enough to distract from the good content .
Deep Fried Bytes - " Deep Fried Bytes is an audio talk show with a Southern flavor hosted by technologists and developers Keith Elder and Chris Woodruff . "
Also tends to be a little irregular as far as publish dates , but they always have interesting guests .
Mostly Windows focused , but not in a fanboy way , they 've had a Linux / Gnome guest and are off to a fine start .
Software Engineering Radio -
A language and platform agnostic show , these folks have over 120 shows in the can .
The audio quality has been a little inconsistent , but the content is diverse and the guests are first class .
Frankly this is one of the most diverse podcasts out there , and they do it without sacrificing depth .
Recommended .
The Java Posse -
To understand .NET , one has to understand that which came before .
The Java Posse has hosts from Sun , Google and Navigenics and is a really quick and terse way to get up to speed on what 's happening in the world of Java .
It tends to be a little random and conversational , but they have VERY thorough show notes and links .
If you 're into Java or selling against Java , a podcast to watch .
OpenWeb Podcast -
It 's new , but it 's got John Resig .
They are still getting the handle of the audio and tend to have problems overdriving the microphone and have issues with leveling and so that 's a little distracting .
However , it 's got some really smart Google and Mozilla employees talking about the Open Web and how to keep it open .
They also get +2 Charisma for publishing not only in MP3 but also in ( the kind of irrelevant but totally open ) OGG Vorbis format .
They have been REALLY spotty , publishing only every month or two , but that 's probably because they are DOING things to make the web better .
Let 's pressure them to publish more .
Ruby on Rails Podcast -
Also pretty spotting on their publish dates , but always a good overview about what 's going on in the world of Ruby on Rails .
Tends to be a little chattier than I like in a technical podcast " Hey , how 's it going , good , how 's the weather " but that 's a stylistic thing .
This Week on Channel 9 - This is kind of " The Daily Show " for Microsoft Developer Geeks .
" Every week Dan Fernandez and Brian Keller sift through hundreds of blogs , videos , and announcements to find the most important stories in the developer community . "
It 's a video podcast primarily , but they also off an MP3 download version as well as versions for iPod and Zune .
I visit this show in person every few months , and it's a lot of fun and a great rollup of the week 's goings on .
Elegant CodeCast -
With a spin towards the Agile / TDD crowd , Elegant CodeCast puts on a show on a roughly twice a month basis .
About Scott Scott Hanselman is a former professor , former Chief Architect in finance , now speaker , consultant , father , diabetic , and Microsoft employee .
He is a failed stand - up comic , a cornrower , and a book author .

Enjoy !
I say give each one a trial or two and see which shows stick .
That 's what I do .
Then I revisit them a year later to see if they stick differently .
I posted the last couple of days about the occupation of the Capital Power Plant , spearheaded by Bill McKibben and Wendell Berry .
Why were there so few comments ?
How come , when we talk about how to compost , we get a huge discussion , but when we mention civil disobedience , there is quiet ?
Do we all agree that we are facing an emergency ?
Do we agree that we need rapid societal change in order to deal with the emergency ?
Do we have a better way to deal with this emergency than protests ?
Sharon wrote :
" I 'm waaaay over the protest model of civil disobedience .
Do n't get me wrong - I 'm planning to go to this - but I want other options for political activism ...
It seems to me we need more - more ways to be activist .
We need a new model for civic engagement that supplements sixties - style civil disobedience and inspires all those people who roll their eyes at this kind of protest .
We need those voices too - how can we inspire them to speak ? "
I have to admit to being flummoxed at times .
The obstacles are great .
There is still not a critical mass of people who believe we are in a crisis and who can overcome the influence of special interests in the political realm .
Nor do there seem to be enough people willing to change their lifestyles to have sufficient effect to reduce our resource use substantially .
So , what ?
Two things , I think :
One is that we have to continue to look for and examine new methods of activism .
I like a model I call " distributed power , " where we become self - sufficient enough in our energy generation and food growth , as examples , to take the power out of the hands of centralized corporations and " distribute " the power to the people .
But again , we 're back to the question of how to get enough people to participate .
The other way forward is to start from where we are .
That is to say , if the only tools we have are dispersed individual action and gesture - like political action , then we accept that , for now , those are the tools we have .
We can't afford to wait around until we have the best plan .
In other words , just because we do n't know if there might be more efficient ways to start does n't mean we should n't start .
Just because we do n't know what step four or five in the process should be , does n't mean we should n't take step one .
Just because we are n't sure if we 'll make a difference does n't mean we should n't try .
When I say we , I do n't just mean the radicals in the crowd .
I mean all of us .
If you believe , as I do , that there is an emergency , then it 's time to stop outsourcing your concerns simply because you 've never imagined yourself to be an activist .
It 's time to try .
It 's time for all of us to try .

Google has gone a long way toward solving the biggest drawback of web - based e-mail — what do you do when there is no internet connection ?
Google aims to solve that problem with new offering that will enable Gmail users access from their browsers even when they are n't online .
Of course , using an e-mail client with an IMAP connection , many people have long enjoyed offline access to their Gmail accounts .
But for those of you that want offline access , and the web - based interface , the new Offline mode is what you 've been dreaming about .
The much - requested offline feature , which allows you to read , star , label , archive and compose new mail even when you do n't have an internet connection , will be coming to all Gmail accounts over the next few days .
If you do n't see it just yet be patient , you may have to wait a day or two .
Like the very similar feature available in Google Reader , Gmail 's offline feature relies on Gears , Google 's offline web application API .
If you have n't installed Gears in your browser , do n't worry , Offline Gmail will prompt you to install Gears the first time you try to sync your messages .
Because Offline Gmail is still in the experimental stage ( Google warns that there might be " kinks that have n't been completely ironed out yet " ) , you 'll need to enable it through Gmail Labs .
To get Offline mode set up , click Settings and then click the Labs tab .
Now select the Enable button next to the Offline Gmail feature and then hit the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page .
You should then see a new " Offline " link in the upper right - hand corner of the Gmail window , next to your username .
Just click that link and Gmail will start the offline synchronization process .
Be patient , the initial sync can take a little while .
Once Offline mode is done with the initial sync , moving between offline and online modes happens automatically in the background .
Say you 're stuck on a long plane flight and want to catch up on your inbox overload .
Just fire up Gmail and compose as many e-mails as you like ; when you hit " send " Offline Gmail will store those messages in its outbox and then automatically fire them off the next time an internet connection is available .
There 's also a very cool hybrid mode that Gmail calls " flaky connection mode . "
Flaky connection mode uses the best of both worlds to deal with situations like a weak WiFi signal or ( god forbid ) a dial up connection .
In this hybrid mode Gmail uses the local cache as if you were disconnected , but still synchronizes your mail with the server in the background .
The result is a considerably faster Gmail experience since you only hit the Gmail servers when absolutely necessary — everything else happens by pulling from the locally stored Gears cache .
Now we know what you 're thinking , surely Gmail is n't really going to download and keep local stores of all my mail ?
That could be as much as 7 GB of data for those of you who save every scrap of mail you get .
And the answer is no , Gmail does n't download everything .
In fact it only grabs about 10,000 messages .
And Gmail has its own , somewhat mysterious , method of determining which messages it stores .
Todd Jackson , Gmail 's product manager , tells CNET that Gmail tries " not to download uninteresting conversations . "
How does it make that determination ?
Part of the determination of what to download relies on the date of the conversation .
As you would expect Offline Gail ignores the Trash and Spam labels , but Gmail will also ignore any labels that contain mostly unread conversations ( more than 99 percent unread ) .
According to a post in the Gmail Labs Google Group , Gmail will also " download any conversation marked with a label that contains less than 200 conversations , has at least one conversation that has been received in the last 30 days and also has at least one conversation that 's outside the estimated time period . "
That should cover both the Starred and Drafts labels , but if you 're worried about having everything available in Offline mode it might be a good time to do some e-mail housecleaning .
There are two main drawbacks to offline Gmail in this early incarnation .
The first and most annoying is that you can't add attachments to new messages composed while offline .
You can , however , view attachments that are part of any synced messages .
The other potential problem is that there 's no way to access the Contacts section of Gmail .
Still , for most of us , Gmail 's Offline mode offers a way to enjoy most the offline benefits of a desktop app while still taking advantage of the web - based interface with its labels , threaded conversations and other tools .

We are in the middle of yet another inquiry into the question of how police use or misuse force .
The string of inquiries seems endless but we Canadians , like amnesiacs , ca n’t seem to connect the dots and see that we have a problem .
In democracies , police forces are granted a virtual monopoly of coercive tools that range from cuffs , chokeholds , and various other restraints to the most powerful — the firearm , with its ability to end human life .
As part of our social compact , the public have granted these awesome powers .
We made a deal .
The first clause in the contract is that these powers are to be used only for our protection .
Even where the rules are crystal clear , there are bound to be mistakes .
The onrush of real - time events that soldiers call the “ fog of war ” will also muddy the waters .
But self - investigations do not help to provide clarity as much as cynicism .
No other institution with such great coercive powers investigates itself , nor should it .
All inquiries into excessive use of force should be fully independent .
For the sake of their own legitimacy , I think that police should be the first to make this demand .
Nevertheless , a pattern emerges : someone dies in police custody .
During the internal inquiry we hear a few calls for a fully independent system to investigate these cases .
After that , the calls die out , sometimes even before the end of the inquiry .
We Canadians appear to have an automatic default attitude towards our police : an attitude of trust .
The other option — that of skeptical inquiry — seems to cause us some discomfort .
Our police forces are held in high esteem , almost wrapped in cotton batting .
Every society has some sacred cows .
Sentimental attachments to institutions or traditions can grow to become icons that suspend our critical faculties .
Elsewhere the police are understood to be as fallible as lawyers , mechanics , or anyone else in society .
But here , the police , and the RCMP in particular , may be saddled with some extra symbolism : the Mounted Police are , after all , part of Canadians ’ national foundation myth .
Wherever it grew from , this gentle treatment creates a climate of impunity that could lead to worse abuses — and it may have already .
The second clause in the public ’s contract with the police says that they will also protect our institutions , most importantly the institutions of our democracy .
Any police involvement in politics in a way that might affect the proper functioning of the democratic process has ominous implications .
On the national stage some recent police actions seem to have exposed ( at least ) the party political preferences of officers involved , or of their superiors .
Most worrying was the Ralph Goodale case , where a possibly spurious police investigation appears to have been timed to have an influence on the outcome of the election then in progress .
As they say of good comedy ( and in politics , too ) , timing is everything .
If this affair is in fact as suspicious as it looks we should be outraged .
But we do not know and we probably will not ever know if the intentions were cynical because there has not been a fully independent inquiry .
I cannot fathom the public ’s quiescent response , but I imagine that it would not be so muted if , for example , it had been the army and not the police who appeared to be tinkering with democracy .
Questionable deaths in police custody should automatically trigger a full independent investigation but so should any question of politically motivated actions .
A reasonably vigilant public is a sine qua non .
Catastrophes have occurred without it in otherwise functioning democracies .
In the German city of Koblenz , 85 percent of the police who served during Adolf Hitler ’s years were hired prior to 1933 .
Closer to home , since the beginning of the “ war on terror ” , there have been terrible violations of human rights and of law in the U.S. Barack Obama ’s incoming attorney general Eric Holder said , “ Our government authorized the use of torture , approved of secret electronic surveillance against American citizens , secretly detained American citizens without due process of law , denied the writ of habeas corpus ” ¦ ” , etc .
It is possible that when the history of this time is reckoned , in at least two cases that we are aware of , various Canadian agencies will also be found to have acted against the law .
The first of our human rights is the right to security .
No other human rights are possible without that foundation .
Our police forces defend this right , sometimes with great bravery .
I therefore imagine an ideal in which individual police officers see themselves first and foremost as defenders of human rights .
Meanwhile , clear rules for use of force , chain of command procedures , and provisions for automatic independent review are prerequisites of a good system .
But I think that none of it can ever work well in a public climate of complacency .

PCC の構成は http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/ftp/pub/pcc-docs/porttour.ps に移植方法 は http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/ftp/pub/pcc-docs/targdocs.txt
に分かりやすいドキュメントがあります．拡張子.psのドキュメントはPostScript形式です．オンラインサービス
http://www.ps2pdf.com などでPDF形式に変換できます．
フロントエンドおよびバックエンドそれぞれの移植方法を書いていきます．
PCC のコードは pcc-08613.tgz を使用しました．また移植したコードは
http://febhare.bake-neko.net/Src/pcc_porting_diff.tgz です． 移植したコードを走らせるには，pccのコードを展開した後に，上記の移植コードを上書きでコピーしたのちにMakeします． pccは厳密に同じ日付ではなくても コンパイル できると思います． コマンドは以下のとおりです :
pccはビルド
にThe GNU configure and build systemを利用しています．まずは移植用コードをビルドできるようにします． まずプロセッサ名 をSimple Risc Processor の頭文字をとりsrpとします．移植コードは " arch / srp " 以下に置くとします ． サポートするOS は NetBSD とします ． まずconfigure.acの20行目あたりを以下のように編集します．ターゲットCPUがsrpのときにtargmachにsrpを設定します．
のようにビット幅を定義します．アライメントも同様です．
レジスタ の定義は，クラス， レジスタ の状態，そして重なりをそれぞれ指定します． レジスタ は，例え ば8 - bit幅 と 16 - bit幅 の レジスタ ， 浮動小数 点用の レジスタ と，いくつかのクラスに分けます． それらのクラスは
，RSTATUS にSAREG のようにSxREGの形で定義します．クラスはAからDまでの4通りが取れます． 今回のターゲット SPR の0番の レジスタ は常に0 の定数なので， レジスタ 割り当てに使いません．そのような レジスタ は0 を設定します． レジスタ が関数呼び出し側で保存されるな
らTEMPREG ，被呼び出し側で保存されるならPERMREGとします． 最後に レジスタ の重なりを指定します ．SPR はそうではないのですが，ターゲットによっては例えば16 -bit レジスタ を 2本の8 - bit レジスタ として使うことができます．このような レジスタ の重なり をROVERLAP に 指定します．これは重なり合う レジスタ を配列で指定します ．
フロントエンドは ，" arch/srp/local.c " と " arch / srp/code . c " から構成されます．解析した ソースコード から構築した解析木をバックエンドに送る前に処理をすることができます．ここで機械依存の処理をすることはないので，他の適当な アーキテクチャ からファイルをコピーしてくればよいです ．
バックエンドの移 植
" arch/srp/local2.c " , " arch/ srp/table.c " , およ び" arch/srp/order.c"を書きます．まず中間言語を機械語に変換するルールを記述するtable.cを説明します．
table .c にはstruct optab の配列 table [ ] を書きます．struct optab は " mip/pass2.h " で定義される下記の構造体です．
extern struct optab { int op ; int visit ; int lshape ; int ltype ; int rshape ; int rtype ; int needs ; int rewrite ; char * cstring ; } table [ ] ;
この構造体に，例えば加算ならば下記のように値を設定します．
{ PLUS , INAREG , SAREG , TINT , SAREG , TINT , NAREG|NASL , RESC1 , " add A1 , AL , AR ; plus
" , } ,
イメージとして，ツリー構造の中間言語の節にあてはまるstruct optabをそれぞれ適用して，その都度機械語に変換していきます．
struct optab のフィールドopにはマッチするノードタイプを設定します．ノードタイプは" mip/node.h "
109行 目から定義されています．演算 " +" を意味するノートタイプPLUSを指定しています．
struct optab のフィールドvisitに は，このルールを適用する場面をかく( みたい?)です．コードを生成するときに，このフィールドのビットが立っているかどうかで，ルールの適用を行っているみたいです．例えば
条件分岐の機械語を生成するときは FORCC
が立っている物を使うようです．よく理解していないのですが，結果をレジスタに収めるものはINAREG
( クラスAのレジスタ ? ) を指定しています．
struct optabのフィールドlshapeおよびltypeは，変数の型などを指定します．lxxは木の左ノード，rshape , rtypeは木の右ノードを示します．shapeはpass2.hの73行目から定義されていて，レジスタクラス
SxREG ，コンスタン トSCON，レジスタ間接アドレッシングSORえｇなどが設定できます．typeはpass2.hの112行目から定義されており，C言語の変数型が例えばTCHARのように設定できます．
フィールド needs は，このルールを適用するのに必要なレジスタなどを指定します．なにも必要ないなら0を設定します．例えばCLASS
A のレジスタが2つ必要ならば 2*NAREGとします．さらにこの2つのレジスタを，ツリーの左要素のレジスタと共有してよいならばNASL(ツリーの右要素と共有するなら
NASR ) を追加します．ここで確保したレジスタは，最後の機械語生成で，例えばクラスAのレジスタならばA1 , A2のように指定できます．
フィールドrewriteは，このルールの結果をどこに保存されるかを設定します．確保したレジスタ(先ほどの例でいえばA1)に収められるならRESC1
( 同様 にA2ならばRESC2 ) を設定します．
下記のような単なる型変換ならば，RLEFT/RRIGHTのように木の子要素をそのまま指定します．下記の例ではTCHARのノードをTSWORDもしくはTSHORTの型に変換します．
{ SCONV , INAREG , SAREG , TCHAR , SAREG , TSWORD|TSHORT , 0 , RLEFT , " # convert char to short / int
" , } ,
代入を行 うASSIGNなどは，rewriteにRDESTを指定しなければいけません．(文法チェックにそう書かれている.)
最 後のcstringは変換結果を文字列で指定します．アルファベット小文字はそのまま出力されます．アルファベット大文字のものは以下のルールで置換されます．
この置換は mip/match.cの 265行目の関数expand() が行います．使うのは' A'のアドレス指定だと思います．関数expand() は' A'で始まる要素を見つけると，local2.c にある関数adrput ( ) を呼び出します．この関数adrput()
は自分で実装します．また，'
Z'で始まるものは" spr/arch/local2.c"に記述する関数zzzcode()を呼び出しますから，ターゲット固有の特別な変換をしたいときに頭文字Zで始めておけば便利かもしれません．
2番目の文字が，'L ' , ' R'ならば木の左/右要素を示します．数字'1'~'4'ならば，例えばフィールドneedsで要求したレジスタが割り当てられます．

I got a very interesting piece of spam in my inbox this morning , and it took me a few moments to realize it was a phishing attack designed to make me disclose my Google Adwords password .
Here is a screenshot of it .
Hovering over the link , you can see that they use a machine name of “ adwords.google.com , ” however , it continues as a session name , followed by random numbers , and finally , a domain name located on a Russian host .
This attack is designed to trick website operators and blog owners into disclosing their Google account password .
So far I have only seen Adwords used as a phishing attack .
I suspect that it would work just as well with Adsense and other Google subscription and pay services as well .
Many users of Google services use the same password for all of their services - for Gmail , Google Analytics , Webmaster Tools , Adsense and even Google Write .
Allowing this password to be disclosed would likely allow the attacker to take over not only the the Gmail account itself , but also to access all the services and websites where the Gmail address was used to register .
Securiteam has a blog post here about a man who had many businesses and forwarded all of his emails to his Gmail account for ease of access , easy searching , and convenience .
When his Google account was locked , undoubtedly because he was Phished , he literally lost the keys to his business and was unable to interact with his customers .
It took days to regain his access .
Bottom line is , do n’t fall for these phishing attacks .
Make sure you have a backup email notification built into your Google account (s ) , and for God ’s sake , do n’t use the same password for everything .
The same goes double for Yahoo accounts .
Perjury charges sought after Burris fundraising revelation Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday February 17 , 2009
Print This Email This Sen. Roland Burris , appointed by now impeached Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich , is under fire by state lawmakers for what they believe to be inconsistencies in testimony and sworn affidavits .
The perceived discrepancies are great enough that on Tuesday , Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan referred Burris testimony to prosecutors for consideration of perjury charges .
The specter of a perjury investigation was raised only after Sen.
Burris admitted Monday night that at the same time he was being considered for President Obama 's former Senate seat , he attempted to arrange a fundraiser for the embattled governor .
Burris said he gave up and deemed it inappropriate , but only after he'd failed to attract contributors .
" Madigan released a letter to Sangamon County States Attorney John Schmidt indicating he was referring a transcript of Burris testimony and two affidavits Burris submitted on how he got appointed to the Senate by former Gov. Rod Blagojevich , " reported the Rockford Register Star .
" Burris told the committee in January he hadnt had contact with key Blagojevich staffers or offered anything in return for the seat . "
However , on Monday night Burris admitted attempting to organize the fundraiser at the request of the governor 's brother , Robert .
" In comments to reporters after appearing at a Democratic dinner , the senator several times contradicted his latest under - oath affidavit that he quietly filed with the Illinois House impeachment panel earlier this month , " reported the Chicago Tribune .
" That affidavit was itself an attempt to clean up his live , sworn testimony to the panel Jan. 8 , when he omitted his contacts with several Blagojevich insiders . "
" Burris said prior to his final conversation with Robert Blagojevich in November he came to the conclusion that because of his interest in the Senate seat , he couldnt raise money for the governor , " the paper said .
" In a letter filed Feb. 5 with his latest affidavit , Burris said , ' I did not donate or help raise a single dollar for the Governor from those conversations . '
But Burris did n't reveal that he tried to put a fundraiser together for Blagojevich -- and failed because of a lack of donors -- before deeming it inappropriate . "
Sen. Burris ' plight was put before two former prosecutors by the Chicago Sun Times on Tuesday afternoon , and each rendered differing opinions of the possible case for perjury .
" I do n't see how this does n't get a serious look by an experienced , independent prosecutor , " Patrick Collins , a former federal prosecutor told the paper .
" Former Cook County prosecutor Irv Miller said he would n't approve perjury charges if the case were brought to him , " the Times continued .
" There may be inconsistencies in Burris ' statements , but key questions put to Burris by a House impeachment panel were asked in meandering fashion , rather than the specific , ' Is n ' t - it - a - fact ? ' style of a prosecutor , he said . "
" They could n't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt , " Miller said .
" Burris would not answer questions Tuesday in Peoria about his attempts to raise funds for Blagojevich , but said he did n't do anything wrong and encouraged officials to look into the matter , " reported the Associated Press .
" I welcome the opportunity to go before any and all investigative bodies , including those referred by Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and the Senate ethics committee to answer any questions they have , " Sen .
Burris reportedly said .

GAZA CITY , Gaza ( CNN ) -- Israeli airstrikes hit a police station in central Gaza and tunnels near the border with Egypt late Sunday , Palestinian eyewitnesses said , after three Israelis were wounded by rocket attacks from the Hamas - ruled territory .
The airstrikes follow Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's warning of a " sharp Israeli response " to rocket attacks .
The Israeli military said airstrikes were underway late Sunday but would not confirm specific targets .
Israeli F - 16 fighter jets were used to strike the tunnels , Egypt 's official Middle East News Agency said .
Israel says the tunnels are used to smuggle weapons into Gaza .
Earlier Sunday , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert promised a " sharp Israeli response " after Palestinian militants fired 10 rockets and mortar shells into southern Israel .
Two Israeli soldiers and one civilian suffered minor injuries in those attacks , Israeli authorities said .
Israel and Hamas , the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , declared separate , tentative cease - fires two weeks ago following a three - week Israeli military operation in Gaza .
Israel launched its attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel .
Hostilities left 1,300 Palestinians dead and 5,400 wounded .
Thirteen Israelis , including 10 soldiers , were also killed in the fighting .
On January 21 , Israel and Gaza 's Hamas leadership each declared cease - fires that took effect after Israeli forces withdrew from the Palestinian territory .
Since the cease - fires began , militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel .
Israel has responded with air strikes .

What is going on people ?

All Paul Stanley does is change his clothes to move from one personna to the other .

Still do n’t belive me ?
Let the facts speak for themselves .
For the third straight year , against all odds , a national grassroots No Nukes campaign has stripped out of the federal budget a proposed $ 50 billion boondoggle for new atomic reactors .
The victory gives a giant boost to solar , wind , efficiency , mass transit and other Solartopian technologies that can solve global warming , sustain real economic growth and bring us a truly green - powered Earth .
This latest victory came Wednesday , February 11 , as a top - level Congressional conference committee ironed out the last details of the Obama stimulus package .
The loan guarantee scam was slipped into the Senate version by Republican Bob Bennett ( R - UT ) in cooperation with Democrat Tom Carper ( D - DE ) .
The loan guarantees would have backed a Department of Energy program supporting new reactor construction , despite a report from the Government Accountability Office warning that such projects would bankrupt more than half the utilities that might undertake them .
A national grassroots campaign involving virtually all major environmental organizations dealing with energy once again underscored the overwhelming green opposition to atomic power .
The Nuclear Information & Resource Service , Beyond Nuclear , Physicians for Social Responsibility , Environment America , NukeFree.org , Greenpeace , the Natural Resources Defense Council , IEER , Center for American Progress , Taxpayers for Common Sense , Friends of the Earth , Sierra Club , Rainforest Action , Rainforest International and more than 200 national and local environmental and taxpayer organizations joined in opposition to the guarantees .
It is not yet clear but seems likely key impetus on the Hill may have come from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NM ) and House committee chairs Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , David Obey ( D - WI ) and Ed Markey ( D - MA ) , among others .
Gestures of thanks are being widely encouraged .
A similar victory was won in the fall of 2007 when a $ 50 billion loan guarantee was slipped into the national energy bill by then - Senator Pete Domenici ( R - NM ) .
The campaign prompted a song from Bonnie Raitt , Jackson Browne , Graham Nash , Ben Harper and Keb Mo posted at www.nukefree.org.
With the help of Moveon.org , it delivered more than 120,000 signatures to Congress in less than three months .
In 2008 the industry was forced to withdraw a blank check loan guarantee program when the banking system collapsed .
This year ’s attempt came in the dead of night , with virtually no public knowledge .
Only Amy Goodman ’s DEMOCRACY NOW !
Gave it national television coverage , while Richard Greene ’s CLOUT on Air America and the Peter B. Collins show featured national radio play .
No significant story about the plan appeared in the New York Times , USA Today or other major media outside Washington .
The No Nukes victory came within hours of the passing of Guy Chichester , a legendary founder of the Clamshell Alliance and National Green Party .
Chichester helped lead the mass demonstrations at the Seabrook ( NH ) nuclear site that thrust the atomic power issue into the global limelight .
In the 1977 LAST RESORT ( www.gmpfilms.com)
Guy became one of the first to speak on film about a green - powered Earth , arguing that the money being squandered on Seabrook should instead go to renewable energy which would create thousands of jobs and save the planet .
As a green pioneer , Chichester ’s innumerable --- often humor - filled --- non - violent arrests were matched only by his great heart and loving spirit .
Ironically , this latest push for reactor subsidies coincides with what may be a death blow to the proposed Yucca Mountain radioactive waste dump .
Opposed by both Reid and President Obama , the multi-billion - dollar project may be defunded .
After a half - century , the US has no high level nuke waste repository , and none planned .
No one expects an end to the industry ’s relentless assault on the taxpayer trough .
New reactor cost estimates have tripled since 2007 and are likely to at least double again .
Michael Mariotte of NIRS says pro-nukers now want atomic energy labeled “ green ” in a national renewable energy standard .
As Kevin Kamps of Beyond Nuclear points out , additional attempts to get money are likely to follow in upcoming debate on an Energy Bill and other legislation .
But as renewables and efficiency and the movement supporting them surge ahead , the Solartopian vision of a truly green planet , free of fossil / nuke power , becomes ever more real .

The Canadian Police Association says all officers should be allowed to carry Tasers and receive regular training to ensure they are using them correctly and in appropriate situations .
The CPA and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police released their joint position paper on the use of Tasers in Ottawa on Tuesday .
The groups also recommended that provincial governments set a uniform standard for training , testing and reporting incidents when Tasers are used .
" This would assure ( law enforcement ) agencies , their oversight bodies and the public that the police are exercising due diligence in the use of conducted energy weapons , " CPA president Charles Momy told reporters .
Momy and Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police Vice - president Tom Kaye maintained that there is no evidence that a Taser has directly caused the death of a suspect .
They said that 150 studies have failed to find a link between Tasers and deaths , but did not make reference to any specific research .
However , earlier this month , the RCMP released new guidelines for the use of Tasers , acknowledging that they may increase the risk of death for a suspect who is agitated .
The new policy restricts the use of Tasers to subdue a suspect when the safety of officers or the public is threatened .
The RCMP guidelines were announced as a public inquiry is underway in B.C. to probe the death of Robert Dziekanski , a Polish man who became disoriented at the Vancouver airport .
Dziekanski became agitated after spending hours at the airport looking for his mother , who was waiting to pick him up .
He died after being subdued by RCMP officers , including being hit by a Taser .
Despite police claims that Tasers are safe , a team of Chicago researchers who Tasered pigs in 2006 found that each animal either died or suffered heart problems after being hit in the chest with two 40 - second jolts .
Both Momy and Kaye said that the general public has been misinformed about the potential dangers of Tasers , and cited examples when people have been subdued when they were threatening to commit suicide .
Both men said officers are already authorized to use force when necessary , and called Tasers a valuable public safety tool .
" The CEW is used in situations when there is an imminent need to control , and when other options have been ruled out by a police officer , " Momy said .
However , they also cautioned that there is the risk of injury or even death associated with other forms of force , including batons and pepper spray .
This is the year we are being set up for major corporate control over our food supply and health .
We have two food systems , one corporate and industrial , dependent on synthetic chemicals , drugs , and GMOs , and producing contaminated food and illness - Big Pharm - and the one we are all hoping for - one that is human and natural , dependent on pure soil , grass , sunlight , normal plants and healthy animals , and producing pure food that is health giving .
We also have two health systems , one that is corporate and industrial , dependent on synthetic chemicals , genetically engineered drugs , and with treatments often controlled by the Pharmaceutical and insurance industry and a multi-billion dollar business dependent on illness - Big Pharma - and the one that many of us are already involved with , that is natural and gentle , using support for body 's immune system to cure diseases , teaching that pure food can itself be healing .
In both cases , corporations have been working aggressively to get rid of the competition - raiding raw milk dairy farmers who produce pure and healthier milk and organic coops on one side and health care practitioners who offer natural treatments that heal , on the other .
They are also working to control the treatments we get , the doctors ' freedom to decide on their own , the hospitals ' ability to be flexible on anything , and all medical information about us .
Why ?
Because we are becoming a trapped " resource " for their profits - our illnesses are big money .
Control over every aspect of that is being taken over .
The less health we can maintain on our own , the more illness we develop and can still pay for , the less services they have to deliver to us , the less reimbursement we get , all adds up to more profit .
We are like cows which produce milk and get milked .
We produce illnesses which get milked .
They pump cows with rBGH to produce more milk and kill them off when they " burn out " many years early .
They keep us on a diet of Monsanto Bt - corn that is linked to diabetes , a disease that has increased 90 % ( look at that again - 90 % ) in only 10 years and brought in a 60 % increase in costs ( profits to the medical industry ) , and Monsanto Bt - soy linked to allergies and asthma , and push rBGH on us ( by pushing milk but keeping rBGH unlabeled ) , linked to cancers .
Monsanto even has one of its own heading the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation .
The industrial medical system works just like with industrial food - cheapest possible inputs ( synthetic and lowest quality and least inspection ) , maximum regimentation of resources ( us ) , digitizing of information as a means of control and lowering costs to them at every possible point , cost cutting around service , and with a monopoly ( " captive market " ) , able to charge what they wish at will .
On the industrial side , everything is based on controlling images .
Ads for food , ads for drugs - a bright and shining world it seems .
But on the natural health side , the FDA threatened cherry growers that they could n't even provide a link to a peer reviewed study showing cherries are potentially ten times stronger at controlling pain than NSAIDs - aspirin , ibuprofen , etc. though NSAIDs kill thousands each year ( without even including OTC drugs ) and cause the hospitalizations of well over a hundred thousand each year .
There is no internet record of a single death by cherry ... or even cherry pit .
We pay the FDA to protect our health .
But our politicians are paid by Monsanto and others to protect their profits .
Just in purchasing NSAIDs alone , we are worth billions .
The studies are clear that NSAIDs are dangerous .
Farmers can't even let people know the truth , while Aleve ( is it Aleve or a different drug ? ) is allowed on TV ads to offer free samples and to encourage people to share it with friends .
Obama 's stimulus package has an image as well .
hides Big Pharma control over you and over your choice in seeking health in the way you wish , including even through your own doctor and their ability to provide for you as they might consider fits you and not a industrial and insurance standard .
The regulations making normal farming impossible , digitizing life down to minutia , mandating controls that remove truly basic freedoms , is being pushed by Monsanto .
Monsanto is one of the largest pharmaceutical corporations in the US .
It has controlled the FDA before .
It is logical to assume that what is hidden within the Obama bailout was written by Monsanto or pleasing to it .
So , welcome to what Monsanto is now doing to your health - not just your food .
Who loses freedom through the Obama bailout ?
You .
Qui bono ?
Big Pharma .
Here are organizations working to protect your freedom and a website informing people of news about natural health and problems with the industrial system .

" MOUSE WARRIOR " ACTION ITEMS
Do n’t know about you , but I am FIRED UP about Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal ’s speech last night .
After “ Communist - in - Chief ” Barack Obama spoke to Americans like they were a bunch of babies ( all the while scheming to steal their money and give it to the banks , which he would then nationalize , meaning he would get a huge year - end bonus ) , it was refreshing to see a politician who is n’t afraid to speak to Americans like they ’re adults .
I ’ll admit , I have n’t really been paying attention to the USA Leninism Stimulator Act , or whatever it ’s called .
( All I knew was that it cost about fifty quadrillion dollars , and if you started stacking $ 100 bills on top of each other the day Jesus was born , they ’d eventually reach all the way around the equator and into outer space and we ’d all be forced to walk to the moon on a stairway of dollar bills made from how wasteful the government is . )
But it took Bobby Jindal ’s confident , manly speech and ferocious , slashing hand gestures to really bring home to me just how wasteful the Stimulator Package really is .
Did you know the USA government wants to spend your money on something called “ Volcano Monitoring ? ”
Are you kidding me ?
Like Jindal said , “ Americans can do anything , ” and that includes monitoring our own d*mn volcanoes .
Seriously , how hard can it be ?
It ’s probably like ice fishing .
Just get some binoculars and some graph paper and a thermometer and sit around looking at a stupid volcano and every once in a while , write down some data , like , “ The volcano is still sitting there , lookin’ like an off - brand mountain with a hole in it .
10 + 50 – 20 .
Pie chart . ”
Remember : Americans can do anything .
They do n’t expect the government to fix everything .
True Americans are n’t afraid of the drama and risk of the free market — the transformative thrill of creative destruction — the hot explosion of the unexpected — the dynamism of having your outmoded assumptions ( and your home ) buried in the burning lava of innovation — the full - throated cries of agony as yesterday ’s losers are turned to ash and new , more productive members of society are birthed !
Ladies and gentlemen , Americans can do anything !
Let ’s prove it to the world !
LET ’S ALL GET KILLED BY VOLCANOES !
All right , I was weeping too .
To be honest , the restoration of science was the least of it , but when Barack Obama proclaimed during his Inaugural Address that he would “ restore science to its rightful place , ” you could feel a dark cloud lifting like a sigh from the shoulders of the scientific community in this country .
When the new president went on vowing to harness the sun , the wind and the soil , and to “ wield technology ’s wonders , ” I felt the glow of a spring sunrise washing my cheeks , and I could almost imagine I heard the music of swords being hammered into plowshares .
Wow .
My first reaction was to worry that scientists were now in the awkward position of being expected to save the world .
As they say , be careful what you wish for .
My second reaction was to wonder what the “ rightful place ” of science in our society really is .
The answer , I would argue , is On a Pedestal  but not for the reasons you might think .
How Can the U.S. Economy Recover Without Manufacturing Capacity ?
" You ca n't put people to work in American factories that do n't exist . "
The strength of the federal economic stimulus package is seriously diluted by the fact that many of the manufactured goods that will be purchased for the attempted recovery must be imported from outside the United States .
America simply does n't make lots of things , anymore .
That means many billions of dollars that folks assumed would go towards fueling an American economic comeback , will instead provide work and paychecks to employees in other countries , that still have manufacturing bases .
That 's fine with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which is dominated by large multinational corporations - the same guys that began stripping the United States of manufacturing jobs decades ago .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was one of the main lobbyists opposed to provisions that would have mandated that stimulus money go to U.S. companies .
The Chamber is a U.S. organization in name only , like its finance capital comrades , the guys that gave the world such a bad case of the dreaded " American Disease , " much of the planet is praying that cash - rich China will eventually bail everybody out .
The United States ' lack of a manufacturing capacity makes it even less likely that anything resembling a lasting recovery can emerge from President Obama 's approach to the economic crisis .
The infrastructure projects that are supposed to be central to the recovery scheme are only valued at $ 150 billion - which is not much of a jolt , especially when much of what will have to be bought is only available in other countries , made by foreign workers .
Barack Obama has put a huge emphasis on building a green economy .
However , according to the New York Times , most of the sources of solar panels and wind turbines are located in Europe and Asia .
There can be no green economy without a mass transit makeover of the United States , but the U.S. has n't made subway and light rail cars in many years .
They 'd have to be imported .
" Most of the sources of solar panels and wind turbines are located in Europe and Asia . "
Every product that must be imported for the infrastructure project means a watering down of the stimulus impact of the dollars spent .
You can't put people to work in American factories that do n't exist .
A true national recovery effort would mean re-industrialization , on a grand scale and a green model , through massive direct federal creation of state - owned industries independent of the finance capitalists who murdered American manufacturing and then blew up their own businesses on Wall Street .
But this is already nearly impossible , since President Obama is committed to saving the banking class through unlimited infusions of public money , and then allowing these reborn zombies to resume their roles as lords of development .
The bankster parasites have neither the capacity nor the intention to build anything other than mountains of debt for the rest of us .
Therefore , Obama 's partnership with them spells doom for national recovery .
Like Billy Preston said , " Nothin ' from noth in ' leaves nothin ' .
" The U.S. cannot create the conditions for economic health without rebuilding a manufacturing capacity .
And the remnants of Wall Street have nothing to contribute to an economic recovery , but an infinite capacity to steal .

26 Feb 09 , 07:57 US Economic Recovery
I 'm glad someone finally said it .
You are so right about the essential need for America to be producing SOMETHING besides mountains of debt .
What we are left with is selling off our infrastructure : roads , airports , water systems , electrical systems , etc. ( most of which is state - owned ) , our real estate , and the basis of our natural resources : mines , river / dams , ports , forests , etc .
All the things that took 400 years to build and which maintain the US as a powerful sovereign , independent country and which should NEVER be sold .
And when all that is sold off to foreign buyers , what 's left ?

Without a foundation , a house wont stand .
The foundation of any economy is manufacturing .
This phony economy WILL fall .
BHO is just delaying the inevitable with this bailout as this much debt will be unrecoverable .
Have a nice day .

The fact is that the US is still the largest manufacturer in the world .
Quite a bit larger as it turns out .

There are reasons other than conspiracies and poor - me syndrome that America does not possess a large manufacturing sector .

16 May 10 , 15:55 collapse then recovery
No need to worry , guys , there will be a recovery .
It 's going to require that we collapse first , but the truth is we can't fail in the long run .
It 's going to take a super collapse for us to realize that we can't do the things we do .
We can't screw bolts onto a car for 50 bucks an hr .
When we realize this and just accept what we can get then we 'll recover .
The reason China gets all the work is because their employees will work for what they can get to survive .
We have to get back to the basics and quit wanting all of this excess , all of this crap that we 've been brain washed into wanting and just want the simplest things like a house and a happy family .
not cable television , sports cars , and all of this technology that really is just a distraction from each other .
When we finally collapse and everyone goes through a reality check , we will see us come back and become more strong and influential than ever !

I do n;t think they should get $ 50 an hour but how about 20 or 25 ?
All these people from 1950 on got paid well enough to raise a family .
The owners of the companies got rich .
So why should we work for 8 dollars with no benefits to compete with China ?

17 Aug 10 , 15:02 Manufacturing myth
Greg , I suspect intuitively that much of that so called manufacturing in the USA is military spending and its multiplier effect .
It is not a sustainable type of manufacturing , rather a subsidy and a symptom of our socialism orgy .
You will find companies like Boeing , Northrup , Lockheed , Ratheon , Haliburton , etc ...
Owen , we indeed could do well at any wage , even $ 8 , if we would stop stealing from ourselves :
http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article21650.html
http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article21925.html#comment93897
We have to first starve the socialism , which means collapse .
Then we can recover with a smaller govt and build back up again ( unfortunately probably the end of the nation states and the start of a new world government unless more people stop using debt and interest rates ) .
As for competing with the 6 billion poor people in the world , you will have to .
They have just as much as you do to the world 's resources .
You were able to steal from them from past decades and keep them beaten down .
You do n't realize it , but the fiat system enabled this .
No it is pay back time .
Prepare .
Shelby Moore
17 Aug 10 , 15:07 $ 8 per day
Hope you realize in China ( and the other billions of poor in world ) that is $ 8 per day , not per hour .
Are you prepared ?
Got gold and silver yet for the hyper-inflation that will revalue the world system so your wages are equivalent to $ 8 per day in 2010 dollars ?
The only question is " are you prepared ? " .
Because no amount of talking and politicing is going to prepare you .

There is not doubt that USA is not only no longer a super power but also will enter in many new social and economical problems that will have the same destiny as USSR .
All signs show and confirm this reality .
There are clear signs that new fast growing super powers will take the world economy control fully in hand and USA has no choice unless accepting the break down American way of life ( with all of its high standards can not be financed .
not only by US government but also no other system can feed such way of life in the intelligent world of these days that there is no nation to capitalize and there is no area to occupy and steel its resources ) USA is finished
Build Your Own Plastic Bottle Greenhouse
December 26th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Do you have tons of plastic bottles lying around your house and excess backyard space ?
If so , you might want to look into building a plastic bottle greenhouse .
The greenhouse idea was devised and brought to life by Blue Rock Station .
For $ 5 ( the electronic version is $ 4 ) , you can buy instructions to build one yourself .
Make sure you have plenty of tires for the rammed earth foundation , at least 1000 2 - liter plastic bottles , straw bale , and two 55 gallon rain barrels .
A hefty load of starting materials for sure , but nothing compared to what you would need for a traditional greenhouse .
And what better use is there for plastic bottles ( besides energy - intensive recycling ) ?
Blue Rock Station ’s greenhouse booklet discusses design creation , site prep and drainage , wind issues , orientation , insulation , and more .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
The European Commission has taken another shot at software giant Microsoft , by saying that the US technology company could be breaking the law by packaging its Internet Explorer web browser with Windows .
In what it is calling a " preliminary " view on a complaint by one of Microsoft 's rivals , the Commission said it believes that the company " distorts competition on the merits between competing web browsers " by bundling IE with every copy of Windows .
In a statement , officials said that there were a number of possible problems with Microsoft 's actions .
" The Commission is concerned that through the tying , Microsoft shields Internet Explorer from head - to - head competition with other browers , which is detrimental to the pace of product innovation and to the quality of products which consumers ultimately obtain , " it said .
The complaint , made in 2007 by Norwegian web browser company Opera , is essentially an extension of the landmark case in the 1990s that saw Microsoft go up against the US government over allegations of anti-competitive behaviour .
In 1998 , the US government tried Microsoft over accusations that it unfairly maintained its monopoly , ending with that the company " will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm … that could intensify competition " .
Although the US Department of Justice initially sought to split Microsoft in two , an intervention by President George Bush culminated in a settlement in 2001 – although thanks to a torturous appeals process , the agreement was not finally settled until 2004 .
But commission officials said that the punishments put in place by Washington lawyers did not affect the legal standing of Windows or Internet Explorer in Europe .
The Seattle - based software company responded to the Commission 's latest statement by saying that it is studying the documents and has two months to respond .
" We are committed to conducting our business in full compliance with European law , " it said in a statement .
Although the company gave recognition to the statement of objection , it did not address the allegations themselves or state whether it would request a hearing .
The announcement is just the latest episode in a long and bruising conflict between European officials and the American hi-tech giant .
Last year , the EU fined Microsoft a record £ 680 m for charging rivals " unreasonable " prices to access parts of its software – adding to other fines and levies totalling more than £ 1.5 bn over the past four years .

Montreal , February 3 , 2009 - Zen meditation - a centuries - old practice that can provide mental , physical and emotional balance - may reduce pain according to Université de Montréal researchers .
A new study in the January edition of Psychosomatic Medicine reports that Zen meditators have lower pain sensitivity both in and out of a meditative state compared to non-meditators .
Joshua A. Grant , a doctoral student in the Department of Physiology , co-authored the paper with Pierre Rainville , a professor and researcher at the Université de Montréal and it's affiliated Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal .
The main goal of their study was to examine whether trained meditators perceived pain differently than non-meditators .
" While previous studies have shown that teaching chronic pain patients to meditate is beneficial , very few studies have looked at pain processing in healthy , highly trained meditators .
This study was a first step in determining how or why meditation might influence pain perception . " says Grant .
Meditate away the pain
For this study , the scientists recruited 13 Zen meditators with a minimum of 1,000 hours of practice to undergo a pain test and contrasted their reaction with 13 non-meditators .
Subjects included 10 women and 16 men between the ages of 22 to 56 .
The administered pain test was simple : A thermal heat source , a computer controlled heating plate , was pressed against the calves of subjects intermittently at varying temperatures .
Heat levels began at 43 degrees Celsius and went to a maximum of 53 degrees Celsius depending on each participant 's sensitivity .
While quite a few of the meditators tolerated the maximum temperature , all control subjects were well below 53 degrees Celsius .
Grant and Rainville noticed a marked difference in how their two test groups reacted to pain testing - Zen meditators had much lower pain sensitivity ( even without meditating ) compared to non-meditators .
During the meditation - like conditions it appeared meditators further reduced their pain partly through slower breathing : 12 breaths per minute versus an average of 15 breaths for non-meditators .
" Slower breathing certainly coincided with reduced pain and may influence pain by keeping the body in a relaxed state . " says Grant .
" While previous studies have found that the emotional aspects of pain are influenced by meditation , we found that the sensation itself , as well as the emotional response , is different in meditators . "
The ultimate result ?
Zen meditators experienced an 18 percent reduction in pain intensity .
" If meditation can change the way someone feels pain , thereby reducing the amount of pain medication required for an ailment , that would be clearly beneficial , " says Grant .

When Should You Buy Real Estate — And When Is It Better to Rent ?
Combing through the questions you — my fabulous readers — ask me , I find one common thread .
I write a lot of posts on real estate , but you want fewer esoteric graphs and articles and more common - sense advice .
Fair enough .
By the time you ’re done reading this , you ’ll have an excellent idea of exactly when higher - priced houses will fall in price , and you ’ll have an armload of data to assist you in determining when a house is priced correctly — no matter where it is or what its price .
This is the blog post that you should send to anyone who is considering buying a house in the next 12 - 24 months .
At the very least , it will arm you with excellent negotiating power .
Two Metrics That Show Whether ANY House is a Good Buy
Here are two facts that are well - known by a few savvy folks , but that most house buyers are unaware of .
How do you tell if any house ( no matter what the neighborhood or location ) is a good buy ?
Just use these two rules of thumb :
Housing prices historically should be 3 - 5 x median annual income .
This one is easy to calculate .
Look up the median household income for your area on city - data.com .
Using their guide for 95118 ( my zip code ) , and scrolling to the bottom of the page , we find that the estimated median household income in 2005 is $ 73,840 .
That means house prices for an average house should be in the range of $ 221,520 to $ 369,200 .
The lowest - priced single - family home in this zip code , however , is $ 489,900 .
That means prices still have far to drop !
The great thing about the 3 - 5 x median annual income marker is that it works for pretty much anywhere in the country .
In more desirable areas , it ’s more likely to be 5 x annual income .
In less desirable areas , you will be able to get more bang for the buck .
For instance , in 47012 , the zip code I grew up in ( in Indiana ) , the median household income for 2005 is $ 43,174 , and the lowest - priced single - family home on the MLS is just $ 14,500 .
( Yes , in Indiana , $ 14,500 buys you a house with land ! )
A comparable house to the $ 489,900 house here in 95118 sells for about $ 70,000 in Indiana — 1.62 x median annual income there vs. 6.63 x median annual income here .
This shows how inflated prices are here in California — as well as in many urban areas around the country .
Wait until you see many houses available in the 3 - 5 x income range before buying .
Housing prices should be approximately 100x - 150 x monthly rent .
This is another indicator to see if housing is overpriced in your area .
Keep in mind that ideally , your monthly mortgage payment should be less than an equivalent rent payment , since mortgage payments do n’t include taxes , insurance , and maintenance , and rent payments do .
Let ’s use a local example .
I pointed out in 2003 that I felt the condo development where I lived at the time was overpriced .
Now , recently , a condo in that development came on the market at a lower price than what I saw in 2003 — $ 329,900 .
This looks like a good deal when you consider that the same condo was selling for $ 342,500 in 2003 , but let ’s look at this through a different lens : rent prices .
Here ’s a nicer condo in the same development renting for $ 1600 / month .
That means you ’re paying 206 x rent to buy the condo ( plus over $ 200 / month as a homeowner ’s association fee ! )
This means this condo , even at the “ reduced ” price , is still not a great deal .
How low will prices go ?
Realistically , I think these condos will be back at 125 - 150 x rent within a few years .
That means this $ 329,900 condo will only be worth about $ 240,000 .
Do n’t buy unless you ’re under 200x rent , and even then , consider ( using the other facts in this blog post ) that the market may drop even more .
An excellent rule of thumb is to never pay more in a 30 - year fixed mortgage payment than you would in rent , since that ’s a great example of a bad deal .
When Will Higher - Priced Houses Fall ?
Here is an estimate of exactly when higher - priced houses will fall .
It ’s based on research I ’ve done since 2006 and hours of reading and correlating past housing bubbles to this one .
We still have n’t seen the worst of the foreclosure crisis .
Several people have commented or written to me asking when housing prices in more desirable neighborhoods such as Los Altos , Palo Alto , and Mountain View will fall .
Those areas are still showing relative strength .
Why are they showing strength ?
Simple : Foreclosures drive market prices , and there have n’t been as many foreclosures in those areas .
Why fewer foreclosures ?
It ’s not for the reasons many think — that people who buy in those areas have better cash cushions .
It ’s simply because prime loans have longer reset periods — and many of them have n’t reset yet .
The reason we are hearing so much about “ subprime ” is because subprime loans reset sooner than prime loans .
Take a look at this mortgage rate reset chart .
It will allow you to “ psychically ” predict the news headlines for 2009 .
What will those headlines say ?
As you can see , subprime will continue to make headlines through 2009 , but in 2009 and 2010 , new headlines will appear : “ Alt - A vulnerable too .
Option ARMs resetting like mad . ”
Many people think “ prime ” loans are safe .
They ’re not — as evidenced by stories like this local couple who took out a $ 1M “ prime ” loan and who will now likely default .
Even “ prime ” homeowners could n’t do the math to realize that a $ 2800 payment on a $ 1 million loan does n’t pay off all the principal .
Welcome to the new reality of “ prime ” loans .
We will be hearing many more stories like this next year as more Option ARMs reset .
Housing runs in 16 - year cycles .
It always amazes me when I hear people say , “ The housing market is unpredictable . ”
Actually , unlike the day - to - day fluctuations of the stock market , the housing market is strongly predictable .
Why ?
There are typical points in your life when you ’re buying a house and typical points when you ’re selling one .
Since birth cycles are well - known , we can predict housing boom and bust cycles .
It takes almost exactly 16 years for a housing cycle to complete a full turn .
This has been true since the Great Depression .
In 2006 , I made a shockingly accurate timeline of this current bust based solely on a blog that posted newspaper clippings from the previous bust in the early 1990’s .
You ’ll see this in a lot of newspaper articles , too — you ’ll be surprised at how many times you see “ since 1991 ” or “ 16 years ago ” in an article referencing when the last time this happened was .
By this methodology , the bottom should be in between late 2010 and 2013 .
But do n’t expect housing prices to rise much if you buy then .
But then again , you were n’t buying as an investment , were you ?
This post gives you all of the tools you need to figure out when buying a house makes financial sense — no matter where you live .
Keep in mind that no matter what housing prices look like , if you do n’t plan to stay in that house for at least 5 and preferably 10 or more years , it ’s not a good deal to buy .
Just rent and invest instead .
Even investing in bonds will likely bring you a better historical return than housing — 5 - 6 % per year vs. 2 - 3 % for housing .
In my opinion , it is always better to have liquid , easily - accessible cash ( in mutual funds or high - yield savings accounts ) than it is to have your money tied up in real estate .
It ’s much easier to click the “ sell ” button in your trading software and get a transfer to your bank account in a few days than it is to take weeks or months to sell your house .
Keep yourself liquid , set up an automatic savings plan , and save for your retirement instead of expecting your house to make you rich .
By following these simple steps , you will be well on your way to creating a wealthy future .
Shares of Microsoft ( MSFT ) fell to a new 52 week low after an unexpected earnings miss .
Let 's take a look at the headline news followed by a discussion .
Reuters is reporting Microsoft stuns with profit miss , to cut up to 5,000 jobs
Microsoft Corp stunned Wall Street with disappointing results that included plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs and a warning that profit and revenue will almost certainly drop over the next two quarters .
Microsoft 's shares dropped 9 percent , adding to a 40 percent decline in the past year .
It blamed the miss on the weakness of the PC market and the popularity of low - cost netbook computers , which have combined to badly undercut sales of its dominant Windows operating system .
The market has become so volatile , Microsoft cautioned , that it has decided against issuing earnings or revenue forecasts for the rest of its fiscal year ending June 30 , 2009 -- other than to predict both will very likely be lower .
" The fact that they are withdrawing guidance is really bad .
It adds to uncertainty .
It is pretty bad when things are deteriorating so fast that even the largest companies in the world do n't know how rapidly it is happening , " said Jefferies analyst Katherine Egbert .
Microsoft posted a profit of $ 4.17 billion , or 47 cents per share , in its fiscal second quarter ended December 31 , versus a profit of $ 4.71 billion , or 50 cents , a year earlier .
Analysts were looking for earnings per share of 49 cents , according to Reuters Estimates .
Microsoft said it will eliminate up to 5,000 jobs in research and development , marketing , sales , finance , legal , human resources and information technology over the next 18 months , including 1,400 jobs on Thursday .
That amounts to about 5 percent of its estimated 96,000 work force , the biggest ever cuts by the software maker .

Kelly Reichardt ’s latest film , “ Wendy and Lucy , ” is 80 minutes long  it would fit inside Baz Luhrmann ’s “ Australia ” twice , with room to spare  and does not contain a superfluous word or shot .
Like “ Old Joy ” ( 2006 ) , Ms. Reichardt ’s modest and critically beloved second feature , “ Wendy and Lucy ” takes place mainly outdoors and registers the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest with unostentatious affection .
Instead of a musical soundtrack there is , for the most part , the sighing of the wind in the trees , the rumbling of freight trains and trucks and , sometimes , the absent - minded humming of Michelle Williams , who plays Wendy , a young woman drifting through Oregon and Washington on her way to Alaska .
The Northwestern setting might put you in mind of a story by Raymond Carver , whose clean - lined prose has something in common with Ms. Reichardt ’s reserved and attentive shooting style .
At first glance “ Wendy and Lucy ” looks so modest and prosaic that it seems like little more than an extended anecdote .
A young woman pauses on her journey in a nondescript , weary town and encounters a run of bad luck , some of it brought about by her own bad decisions .
Her car breaks down .
She is arrested for shoplifting .
Her dog goes missing .
But underneath this plain narrative surface  or rather , resting on it the way a smooth stone rests in your palm  is a lucid and melancholy inquiry into the current state of American society .
Much as “ Old Joy ” turned a simple encounter between two longtime friends into a meditation on manhood and responsibility at a time of war and political confusion , so does “ Wendy and Lucy ” find , in one woman ’s partly self - created hard luck , an intimation of more widespread hard times ahead .
Dumber People Want More Government
Audacious Epigone takes a look at the General Social Surveys data to find that dimmer bulbs are more likely to favor more government intervention and ownership of industry .
In each of the three response pools , the percentage of people saying the government should control the respective industry is small , on the order of 3 % to 5 % .
When it comes to financial services , the intelligence gap is minor .
For manufacturing industries , it is more distinct .
But the trend is consistent -- duller people are more likely to favor government intervention into private industry than more intelligent people are .
Libertarians who support open borders need to come to grips with the fact that they are stoking the fires of government intervention into the economy .
This is bad news for libertarians and free marketeers since AudEpig also finds that dumber people are breeding like rabbits .
This brings to mind the Harvey Danger Flagpole Sitter lyrics " That only stupid people are breeding .
The cretins cloning and feeding " .
He also finds that skinny conservative religious girls are less likely to cheat on their spouses .
Why does skinniness help ?

Plant 's workers exposed to mercury , EPA says CONTAMINATION RISK
On Oct. 10 , 2008 , a demolition crew toppled over a tank during a job at Searles Valley Minerals ' plant in the San Bernardino County town of Trona .
The tank spilled an estimated 90 to 100 pounds of highly toxic mercury at the chemical plant .
The incident occurred about three weeks after another tank had been toppled by a demolition crew at the same site , also spilling 90 to 100 pounds of mercury .
Together the two incidents constitute the biggest mercury spill in the West in the last two decades , federal officials say .

At a Mojave Desert chemical plant , a demolition crew toppled a 50 - foot - high tank , accidentally spilling an estimated 90 to 100 pounds of highly toxic mercury and contaminating the workers ' clothing .
About two weeks later , a crew knocked down a second 50 - foot - high tank , spilling another estimated 90 to 100 pounds of mercury at the same Searles Valley Minerals plant 170 miles northeast of Los Angeles .
Together , the two incidents produced the West 's biggest spill of mercury - a potent neurotoxin - in two decades , said Robert Wise , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on - scene coordinator .
He said he has referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice for review .
Government documents suggest that Searles Valley Minerals failed to follow proper procedures for reporting the spills and also initially understated the amount of mercury that had been spilled .
According to an EPA report and interviews , the company 's failure to follow proper reporting procedures might have exacerbated health risks to six demolition workers who still had mercury on their clothes weeks after the first spill .
Exposure to mercury occurs from breathing contaminated air , and experts say that at high levels , mercury can damage the brain , kidneys and a developing fetus .
Searles Valley Minerals ' executive director , Arzell Hale , defended the company 's actions , saying the Sept. 24 spill was inadvertent and the Oct. 10 spill occurred because of a contractor 's mistake .
He said he was unaware of any damage to workers ' health .
The spills occurred at the plant in the San Bernardino County town of Trona - where 2 million tons of chemicals are produced annually - when a contractor was tearing down an old portion of the plant that had been used to produce fertilizer .
Hale stressed that once the spills occurred , the company cooperated fully with the EPA investigation , and the EPA confirmed that .
The spills represent a new problem for Searles Valley Minerals , which was the subject of a Chronicle report in July detailing a campaign against the plant by a former employee who said the facility 's toxic chemicals had gravely harmed many workers ' health .
The company denied the allegations , but several legislators responded to the series by calling for an investigation of the plant 's safety record .
6 reportedly exposed
Wise said six demolition workers at the site were exposed to contamination from the mercury spills .
He added : " I have been involved in this response program for 21 years , and this is the biggest spill we ever responded to in the region , " which includes California , Nevada , Arizona , Hawaii and Guam .
Hale said that before the first spill , the company had " understood the mercury and other known hazardous substances were removed from the plant . "
Environmental groups and experts familiar with mercury 's toxicity were critical of the company 's handling of the spills and said new demolition laws are needed .
" This is really alarming - I am just shocked - especially because the hazards of mercury have been known for so long concerning its environmental contamination , " said Julia Quint , a retired toxicologist for the state Department of Public Health .
At this point , only one company hired in connection with the demolition is talking publicly .
James Cannon of Bakersfield - based J and J Clean Up Service , a subcontractor on the job , said he provided four workers with cutting torches for the demolition .
He said that before the first spill , his workers were told by supervisors at the site that the tank was safe for removal .
Before the second tank was knocked over , supervisors assured his workers that it was " welded up tight and nothing would come out , " he said .
Cannon said his workers then made the cuts that made it possible for other workers to knock over the tanks .
He added he did not know which company employed the supervisors who gave his employees their instructions .
The prime contractor , Advanced Steel Recovery of Fontana ( San Bernardino County ) and another subcontractor , Western Scrap of Bakersfield , declined to comment .
On the day of the Sept. 24 spill , Searles Valley Minerals notified the state 's Office of Emergency Services about a spill of one pint of mercury - equal to 14 pounds .
About three weeks later , the company amended its report to 90 pounds .
After the first spill , San Bernardino County hazardous material specialist Curtis Brundage said the company called to say " they had it under control , they had a cleanup contractor on site , and it was a small spill .
Had the more accurate information been transmitted to us , we would have responded .
We would have found out that workers had tracked mercury all over and employees had it on their clothes and tracked it back " to the apartments where they were staying .
After the first spill , Hale said an approach was devised to avoid another problem , but a second spill occurred when the demolition contractor used inadequate equipment .
The company reported the Oct. 10 spill to the state as six pounds and about a week later amended that amount to 90 pounds .
The company did not , however , immediately notify the National Response Center , the Coast Guard - run headquarters for such reports , about either spill .
The law requires that when a mercury spill exceeds one pound in a 24 - hour period , the center must be notified immediately .
Instead ,
Wise said the company filed the reports on Oct. 21 after he told them to do so .
Under laws effective last year , any company failing to notify the center promptly about a reportable spill could face a fine of up to $ 32,500 a day , EPA officials said .
Too big to handle
On Oct. 21 , Wise arrived at the plant site after county regulators told him the spills were too big for them to handle .
" There is still visible mercury throughout the debris piles , " Wise wrote in his report .
" In addition , underneath the concrete floor of the structure is a series of canals and raceways containing a large quantity of mercury . "
Wise said it was the demolition workers who faced contamination from the mercury - because they were there when the tanks toppled over and because they wore mercury - contaminated clothes for weeks after the first spill .
Once he learned about the workers ' clothing , Wise said he had Searles ' environmental contractor decontaminate the rented condos where the workers lived in Ridgecrest ( Kern County ) , about 25 miles from the plant .
He said the contractor also ripped carpet out of a worker 's two cars and took away two children 's car seats because of high mercury readings in those vehicles .
After the spills , Wise referred the case to federal prosecutors for review .
He declined to comment on what possible violations the office might be investigating .
Thom Mrozek , a spokesman for the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles , declined to comment on the case , saying his agency does n't discuss the status of investigations , " including whether we have opened one . "
At the plant site , Wise said 75 to 100 tons of steel from the debris site has been sent to a Nevada landfill , and about 2,000 tons of mercury - contaminated soil has been removed ; in addition , 50 drums of high - level mercury waste were " shipped offsite for mercury recovery . "
Meanwhile , the companies involved in the demolition are arguing over how the spills happened , he said : " Everyone admits the first crystallizer ( tank ) was just an accident .
The people involved in the demolition did n't know mercury was in there .
The issue is the second one where they knew mercury was in there , and it was still knocked over . "
Whatever is determined about how the mercury was spilled , experts say that it is a substance to be taken very seriously .
Mercury 's toxicity
Philip Landrigan , a mercury expert who is chairman of Mount Sinai School of Medicine 's Department of Community and Preventive Medicine in New York , said that given the size of the spills , " there is a high likelihood the demolition workers ' exposure exceeded federal mercury limits .
For workers , the principal route of exposure is by inhalation , and once the mercury gets in the body , it travels around , and it is directly toxic to a number of organs .
But you worry most about its toxicity to the brain , nervous system and kidneys . "
Bill Magavern , director of Sierra Club California , said the spills at Searles Valley Minerals indicate the need for new laws governing demolitions .
" We need to make sure buildings are clear of mercury and other hazardous materials prior to demolition , " Magavern said .
He added that the law now requires a professional survey assuring asbestos has been removed from a site , but " there is no similar requirement to have a professional survey for mercury and other hazardous materials . "
Hamas 's defenders like to point out that the movement owes its current dominance of the Palestinian political scene to its success in the 2005 Palestinian elections , when it won a clear majority .
But many of the Palestinians who voted for Hamas did so more as a protest vote against the endemic corruption of Yasser Arafat 's Palestinian Authority than their desire to have an Islamic state imposed upon them .
Once Hamas had won the election , it set about dismantling the Palestinians ' fledgling democratic institutions , replacing them with an Iranian - style , autocratic administration that brooked no opposition .
I just found the perfect job for myself : media consultant for General Laurent Nkunda .
Now there ’s a job with perks .
And General , you need me .
I know you need me because I just saw an interview with you in the Huffington Post .
And even though you answered all the questions totally right , General , you just showed how you do n’t understand the insane , childish way these people think .
A “ cynical ” reader might wonder why any western journo bucked the BBC boycoott on interviewing Tutsi or giving their side of the story .
Maybe they ’re honest ?
For once ?
Or brave ?
No such luck .
Just get that idea right out of your head .
It ’s just an old tribal loyalty , Euro colonizer for native allies , coming out again .
The clue for a serious war nerd is the interviewer ’s name , “ Georgianne Nienaber . ”
Remember , being a serious war buff means clawing and scratching for every clue .
What we have here is a French first name , Georgianne , with a Dutch - sounding last name , Nienaber .
Which tells us this is a Belgian .
The Belgians and the Tutsi , Nkunda ’s people , go way back .
So that ’s why she ’s sympathetic : not because she ’s braver or smarter than the usual rat pack of journalist but because her tribe and his used to be allies .
The problem with the interview is that Nkunda is way too smart and too sane to work effectively with the Western press , even when they ’re trying to be sympathetic .
That ’s the problem for the Tutsi in general : they ’re behaving rationally , trying to create a working nation like the European countries did , only now the psycho descendants of those Europeans are fucking Africa up one more time .
Last time around , they did it with bayonets and gallows ; this time around they ’re doing it with pity and niceness .
It ’s hard to tell which is worse .
See , Nkunda thinks that he ’s supposed to answer the actual questions that this Belgian lady asks him .
Mistake !
If you do n’t mind , General , allow me to offer some tips on dealing with these nutcases .
Let ’s take the first Q&A in the interview as an example :
Question .
Would you say that you have been portrayed in a negative way in Western media ?
Nkunda .
They cut my voice and they speak on my behalf .
Journalists tell what they think will be sensational .
Now General , permit me to offer you , free gratis and for nothing , my advice on what you did wrong and how you should have answered this question .
I mean , technically you did a fine job .
You answered the question , even got specific about how the Western media portrays you negatively , with that bit about how “ they cut my voice and they speak on my behalf . ”
Now that ’s a very good answer ; in fact it ’s an old BBC trick , that faked - up voice thing , they used to do the same thing with IRA people , they always do it to people they do n’t like .
But the average idiot wo n’t know that .
In fact , they do n’t even want to know .
They do n’t want answers , they want boo - hoo - ery .
That ’s all that counts here .
So please , next time do n’t waste any time actually answering the question .
That ’s not how it works .
Go directly to the boo-hooing .
Just yell , “ Victim !
We ’re the victims !
We had to watch two - thirds of the Rwandan Tutsi hacked to death while the West did nothing !
You bastards !
And then when when our little guerrilla force stomped the way bigger Rwandan Army and liberated our people , all of a sudden the UN came in to take care of the same poor Rwandan ‘ refugees ” whose clothes were still soaked with the blood of Tutsi children they ’d hacked to death ! ”
Because ( a ) that ’s simple enough for even a Western journalist to get , and ( b ) it ’s the absolute , disgusting truth .
Please , General Nkunda , do n’t make the mistake of talking honestly to these people again , like they were grownups .
They ’re not .
Africans are grownups ; these people are just big spoiled babies .
Cry at them , scare them , make them whimper .
That ’s all they understand .

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ( 2007 )
A stuntman who doubles for Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe is believed to have suffered a serious injury during filming , according to reports .
The accident happened on set at Leavesden Studios , near Watford , where the latest Harry Potter film , Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , is in production .
The 25 year old was performing an aerial sequence when he fell to the ground following an explosion which was part of the stunt , the Daily Mirror reported .
An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman confirmed a man in his 20s had been injured on set .
He said : " Paramedics were called to Leavesden Studios after a man in his 20s sustained a significant back injury .
He was stabilised at the scene and taken to Watford General Hospital . "
Watford General Hospital refused to comment on the man 's condition , but said he had been transferred to another hospital .
Belfast Telegraph
WASHINGTON --
Some presidents are handed the chance to remake the Supreme Court for a generation , if enough justices leave .
Others wait in vain to make even one appointment .
President Barack Obama took office with a strong prospect that his first four years in office could bring two or more openings on the high court , though he may well be replacing aging liberal justices with younger ones .
Barring the unexpected , the court 's balance of power -- four on the left , four on the right , one in the middle leaning right -- is not likely to change significantly .
Word of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 's illness on Thursday , just two weeks after Obama 's inauguration , set off an inevitable round of speculation about whether she will have to retire sooner than she would wish -- and whom Obama might tap as her successor .
Chances are , Obama 's first appointment will be a woman -- especially if it's to take the place of Ginsburg , the only woman on the court .
And , like Ginsburg , she will be liberal leaning .

Like every sitting justice , she also probably will be a federal appeals court judge .
Obama has a number of options along those lines , including these five :
— Judge Diane Wood of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago .
— Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
— Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York .
— Pam Karlan , a law professor at Stanford University .
— Judge Margaret McKeown of the 9th Circuit in San Francisco .
Either Wardlaw or Sotomayor would be the court 's first Hispanic justice .
Other court watchers have mentioned Elena Kagan , the former Harvard Law School dean whom Obama has nominated as solicitor general , Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Leah Sears .
The calculations would change , but only slightly , if Ginsburg 's is not the first retirement .
The president still would face strong pressure to name a woman or a minority or both .
Pancreatic cancer is a serious disease , with poor rates of long - term survival .
But Ginsburg 's doctors believe they found her growth early , which would boost her chance for recovery .
Plus , Ginsburg 's diminutive appearance belies her toughness .
She fought colon cancer nine years ago without missing a day in court .
No one on the court has signaled that a retirement is imminent , not even 88 - year - old John Paul Stevens .
Five justices are at least 70 and a sixth , David Souter , will turn 70 in September .
The three youngest are all conservatives -- Chief Justice John Roberts , 54 , Samuel Alito , 58 , and Clarence Thomas , 60 .
Roberts and Alito were appointed by President George W. Bush .
Roberts took over for like - minded William Rehnquist , whom Roberts once served as a law clerk .
Bush 's selection of Alito to replace Sandra Day O'Connor , the court 's first woman , nudged the balance to the right .
Obama would have the opportunity to move the court to the left if one of the two older conservatives , Antonin Scalia or Anthony Kennedy , were to step down .
Kennedy is far less a doctrinaire conservative than the others , having joined his more liberal colleagues in recent years on cases involving gay sex , Guantanamo detainees and global warming .
The new president can only wonder at this point whether he will follow Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush , who each filled two vacancies in their first four years .
Actuarial tables suggest he will avoid the fate of Jimmy Carter , who had no high court nominees in his one term .
Obama might dream of the numbers rolled up by Richard Nixon , who named four justices in his first three years in office .
But justices get lifetime tenure and no president can guarantee his picks will turn out the way he hopes .
Three Nixon appointees were part of the 8 - 0 vote by which the Supreme Court ruled in 1974 that he had to turn over audio tapes of Oval Office conversations to the Watergate special prosecutor .
One of those justices , Harry Blackmun , was considered a staunch conservative when Nixon appointed him in 1970 but the court 's most liberal when he retired in 1994 .
A dozen frogs new to science were discovered in the forests of Western Ghats ( Kerala , Tamil Nadu , Karnataka .
Goa , Maharashtra , and part of Gujarat ) .
Amphibian researchers S D Biju of Delhi University , Systematics Lab and Franky Bossuyt of the Amphibian Evolution Lab of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel have published their discoveries in the latest issue of Zoological Journal of Linnean Society , London .
The paper in Zoological Journal of Linnean Society , London describes the discovery of 12 new species including the revision of the genus Philautus .
These findings are the result of 10 years of extensive field study in the Western Ghats throughout its 1600 km range .
Field studies were complemented by DNA research .
This publication is unique because it is the first publication that describes a large number of vertebrate novelties in independent India .
After independence of India , 9 new Philautus species were described .
To this , Biju and Bossuyt have added another 18 new species within four years from 2005 to 2008 .
Some highlights that Biju and Bossuyt have stressed in the publication in Zoological Journal of Linnean Society are :

WORST COVER VERSIONS
1. Madonna
American Pie , 2000 ( Don McLean 1971 )
Is it the monotony of the Queen of pop ’s sickly - sweet and curiously one - dimensional vocals or the cringeworthy synth backing that makes this so unlistenable ?

Knockin ' on Heaven 's Door 2003 ( Bob Dylan , 1973 )
Though she does what she does well , when she applies the “ oooos ” and “ yeah yeah yeahs ” and her simplistic clean guitar chords to Bob Dylan ’s soulful country classic , all hell breaks loose .
At least the Guns n Roses offering had passion .
7. Will Young
Light My Fire 2002 ( The Doors 1967 )

Fairytale in New York ( The Pogues 1987 )
A pointless cover , with Kirsty MacColl 's part sung by Maire Brennan .
10 . Marilyn Manson
Personal Jesus , 2004 ( Depeche Mode , 1989 )
It adds nothing to the original hit except Manson ’s growling .
Late last month , a team of 46 doctors and nurses in the Los Angeles suburb Bellflower pulled eight babies from the belly of a 33 - year - old woman .
The octuplets — the second known set to have been born in the U.S. — were nine weeks premature and were delivered in just five minutes via caesarean section .
The feat shifted from a source of biological wonderment to opprobrium as it was revealed that the mother , Nadya Suleman , an unemployed , graduate student who lives with her parents , already had six other children , ages two to seven .
Many people expressed outrage that taxpayers had been footing the bill for her other children ( through Social Security disability payments and food stamps ) when the Associated Press estimated her medical costs could be $ 1.3 million in addition to the $ 2.7 million estimated to raise all 14 children to the age of 17 .
Police are even investigating death threats against her , and the once - celebrated mom of many has reportedly gone into hiding .
Although humans typically give birth to a single child per pregnancy , twins , triplets and larger " litters " have become more common with the rise of in vitro fertilization , the technique Suleman undertook whereby eggs are fertilized by sperm in a laboratory and later implanted into the uterus .
Because of the cost of each implantation and the likelihood that one or more embryo will not survive , doctors typically implant three fertilized eggs into a woman 's womb to up the chances of a viable birth .
Some believe that Suleman 's fertility doctor , Michael Kamrava , implanted more than that , violating professional ethical guidelines , although not breaking any U.S. laws .
Kamrava , a general practitioner who lacks board certification for obstetrics and gynecology , has one of the worst records for successful in vitro implantations in the country , according to Forbes .
Economic and ethical considerations aside , humans are not biologically equipped to handle so many offspring per birth .
Suleman 's babies ranged in weight from 1.5 to three pounds ( 0.7 to 1.4 kilograms ) , and low - birth weight correlates with lower intelligence and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes , according to BBC reports .
Premature infants , common in multiple births , face a greater risk of breathing problems , brain and organ damage and , later in life , developmental problems and cerebral palsy .
Meanwhile , other mammals , like dogs and rodents , are perfectly capable of having more than 10 babies in a litter .
What makes them different from primates ?
To find out more about the evolution of litter size , we spoke to Robert Sikes , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock , who has studied the northern grasshopper mouse , an animal that has between one and six offspring at a time .
[ An edited transcript of the interview follows ]
How many offspring do most mammals have at a time ?
What about other animals ?
Lots and lots of mammal species have singletons ( a litter of one ) , and a few have large litters .
The lab rat has litters of 10 or more , although part of that may have been a result of breeding in the lab .
Many dogs will have litters in the mid-teens .
If you look at animals like salmon , they are going to produce hundreds of thousands of eggs .
Many invertebrates are going to produce lots of eggs , as well .
How has variation in litter size evolved ?
Organisms that have large litters or a large number of offspring tend to live in an unstable , boom - or - bust environment .
They produce many offspring , and many do n't make it .
If you look at salmon , that 's a great example : maybe a couple of eggs are going to survive .
If the population is constant over time , each individual is replacing itself in the next generation .
Whereas a female may produce 1,000 eggs , only two survive .
On the other hand , organisms that inhabit stable environments have fewer offspring and they allocate more energy to those offspring .
Mammals certainly do this .
Even within mammals , species that have large litters tend to inhabit more variable environments than those that inhabit more stable environments .
Those mammals that inhabit stable environments tend to have very altricial young : they are born naked with the eyes closed and they are helpless without the mom .
Precocial young are well - furred at birth , eyes open , and do n't need a lot of attention from mom .
What are some examples of this ?
Cotton rats are small rodents common throughout the U.S.
They are kind of a " weedy " species .
Their litter size is highly variable .
They have lots of young when resources are plentiful and smaller litters when resources are scarce .
On the other hand , wood rats have a much smaller and very stable litter sizes , but they allocate a heck of a lot more energy to each individual offspring .
Cotton rats do n't nurse as long and their pups are weaned at much smaller sizes and the size at which they are weaned is quite variable .
Wood rats nurse for a longer period of time and are weaned at a larger size .
Humans are altricial and fit in pretty far toward the ' stable environment ' side of the spectrum .
We usually have a single offspring .
That offspring is helpless at birth .
It requires a long period of complete maternal dependence .
The evolutionary lineage we came from — the great apes — are similar in that respect .
So we are not built to have octuplets ?
Humans are ill equipped to handle large litters .
Evolution has simply not set us up to do that well .
Typically , litter size in nature is matched by the number of mammary glands we have .
We have two .
How do you nurse the additional offspring ?
If you look at the energetic cost of offspring , as the litter size increases , the cost of nursing those young increases dramatically .
In the grasshopper mice I work with , a mother rearing a litter of one is going to increase her food intake by 50 percent .
A mouse mother rearing the maximum number of offspring , six , is going to triple her food intake .
It takes a lot of energy to produce this milk .
Do the mice compensate ?
Yes , but they cannot completely meet those needs .
The mouse mother is eating three times as much and eating so much , she can't process any more food .
These mice are at the upper end of their digestive efficiency during lactation , and the intestine lengthens to help extract as many nutrients as they can .
Young from a litter of two are generally larger than animals from a litter of three and those are typically larger than a litter of six ; the larger the young , the better the chance of survival .
If the mother mouse is nursing that much longer , then she has to be foraging longer , and when mothers are out foraging they are subject to predation .
What happens in humans ?
If we were subject to natural selection , octuplets would be a tough load to bear .
Obviously , with our technological abilities , we can step outside of those physical constraints .
Human mothers rearing two , four , six and eight offspring are almost certainly not just nursing enough to meet the energetic demands of those young .
[ They will likely be using infant formula . ]
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Stock markets may remain stagnant and trade sideways for over 15 years , according to hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry , who believes many large mutual fund firms could disappear as a result .

Hendry , partner and chief investment officer at Eclectica Asset Management , also said that poor performance from hedge funds and private equity could leave both industries as niche , little talked about asset classes in the future .
So far this month , Hendry ’s 146.2 million euro ( 122.7 million pound ) Eclectica fund is up an estimated 12.2 percent , after a 49.8 percent rise in October .
In the first ten months of the year the fund is up 27 percent .
“ The stock market could oscillate or go sideways for a period as long as 25 years , from 10 years ago , ” Hendry told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday .
“ We ’ve got another 15 years of markets rising , falling and going sideways . ”
On Thursday the S&P 500 .SPX index fell 6.7 percent to its lowest level since 1997 .
The fall , which takes the S&P to more than 52 percent below its October 2007 record high , makes the current bear market the second biggest on record , exceeded only by the 83 percent drop between 1930 and 1932 , according to Stock Trader ’s Almanac .
Hendry said that as a result of markets making no money for investors in nominal terms , many long - only fund firms which measure their performance relative to stock market indices , rather than in absolute terms , could disappear .
“ You ’re going to lose so many large , long - only institutional managers , ” he said .
" Over 30 years , when the Dow .
DJIA went from 700 to ( nearly ) 14,500 , the principal risk was keeping up with the index .
But benchmark risk is going to be the ruin of your business . "
He also said poor performance by hedge funds and private equity at a time when many investors expected them to make money could leave them as niche , overlooked sectors in future .
This year the $ 1.7 trillion hedge fund industry is delivering record poor performance , down 16.05 percent in the first ten months , according to Hedge Fund Research .
“ The hedge fund industry and private equity industry seem to be very , very comparable to the investment trust sector in the late 1920s -- unregulated , quite leveraged , ” he said .
“ People do n’t talk about them ( investment trusts now ) because they ( messed ) up so badly in a pivotal moment in their history .
I fear for private equity and hedge funds it will be something similar . ”
Hendry said he was looking at buying super senior bank loans but had not done anything yet as they could fall further .
“ We had our first credit meeting in a long time .
We ’re looking at buying bank loans , super senior , ” he said .
“ There ’s one or two we might dabble ... But I ’m waiting . ”
He also said he had cut back leverage on his bet on interest rate swaps -- which he describes as the fund ’s highest conviction trade ever and which made most of his gains in October -- and continues to favour government bonds in the short - term .
How To Start A Rails Edge App The Easy Way
There ’s a lot of cool stuff pooring in about what ’s new in Rails Edge ( which will become Rails 2.3 and / or Rails 3 ) .
Most likely you ca n’t wait to get started with these new features , especially when you ’re about to start a new project , which does n’t have to be stable yet , but will be by the time 2.3/3.0 come out .
This post shows you the way to create a new Rails app based on the most current Rails code , also called Edge Rails .
Let ’s go …
mkdir -p myapp / vendor cd myapp git init git submodule add git://github.com/rails/rails.git vendor / rails git commit -m " Frozen Rails Edge as submodule " ruby vendor / rails / railties / bin/rails . #
Add generated files to git , and code on ...
First , you create a new directory for your app , including the vendor directory .
Easy , right ?
Next , you initialize a Git repository for your empty project .
We ’ll be using Git to track the remote Rails Edge code .
Stay with me .
By adding a Git submodule we tell git to clone the code from git://github.com/rails/rails.git into the vendor / rails directory .
Nice !
If you check the current git status with git status you see git has already staged two files for you , .gitmodules and vendor / rails .
Commit them now to attach the submodule to your local git repository .
Git will not automatically update your submodule , you ’ll have to do that by hand .
I ’ll show you this in a minute .
With vendor / rails containing Rails Edge , you can now generate your Rails Edge application .
In you project directory ( myapp / ) , you call ruby vendor / rails / railties / bin/rails . .
This will generate a new Rails Edge application in the current directory .
Now it ’s up to you to create a fitting . gitignore file and commit the files to your repository .
That ’s all , you now have a new Rails Edge application .
Try ruby script / server to see it all in action .
Enjoy !
Cloning your project
At some point you ’ll push your myapp project to a remote git server .
When you clone a fresh copy , you ’ll have to initialize the git submodules .
This is quite easy :
git submodule init git submodule update
Updating Rails Edge
As I said earlier , Git will not keep your submodules up - to - date for you , but will stick with the revision you added .
To keep track of Rails Edge ’s progress , you ’ll need to update the submodule .
This is done like this :
cd myapp / vendor / rails git remote update git merge origin / master
This will update your Rails Edge code .
Make a commit , stating you updated the code !
After updating Rails Edge , you may want to update your rails application ( like javascript files , config files etc ) .
rake rails : update
Good luck !
And happy coding !
Sentencing has been delayed for a former Marysville police officer convicted of sexually assaulting a child and 13 other charges .
Lawyers for Robert J. Pavlovich Jr. , 40 , of Gettysburg Road in Lower Allen Twp. , filed papers in Perry County Court saying they need more time to respond to an evaluation of Pavlovich by the state sexual offenders assessment board and obtain their own experts to refute it , records state .
The board assesses certain convicted sex offenders to determine if they qualify for being required to register as a sexually violent predator .
Pavlovich was scheduled to be sentenced on Friday before President Judge Kathy A. Morrow .
A new sentencing date has not been scheduled .
In October , a jury found Pavlovich guilty of 10 counts of corruption of minors and one count each of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse , indecent assault , unlawful contact with a minor , indecent assault of a child and bribery in official matters after almost ten hours of deliberation .
Pavlovich remained free on $ 250,000 bail .
More Americans will soon be fitted with bandwidth caps .
Yesterday , Time Warner trumpeted plans to expand its " consumption based billing " brainstorm beyond the tiny Gulf Coast town of Beaumont , Texas and into a few other unnamed cities .
And just hours later , fellow cableco Charter Communications confirmed it will soon put caps on users across the country .
Since June , Time Warner Cable has forced Beaumont customers to choose from one of four monthly caps : 5 , 10 , 20 , or 40 GB .
Pricing plans range from $ 29.95 a month for a 5GB cap and 768 Kbps download speeds to $ 54.90 for a 40 GB cap at 15 M bps .
And if you exceed your cap , you 're charged an extra $ 1 per gigabyte .
Time Warner announced the expansion of this " trial " during yesterday 's quarterly earnings call , but it did not specify which cities would be affected .
Meanwhile , Charter has told Broadband Reports that it will soon update its Acceptable Use Policy to include " residential bandwidth consumption thresholds " - aka caps .
Users whose service runs at speeds of 15 M bps or slower will be capped at 100 GB a month , and those at 15 to 25 M bps will be capped at 250GB .
But the company will not cap users on its new new $ 140 60 M bps DOCSIS 3.0 service .
Charter did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
America 's largest cableco , Comcast , now caps all its users at 250GB .
And in November , AT&T rolled out a metered internet " trial " in Reno , Nevada .
Pricing plans range from $ 14.99 for a 20 GB cap on its 768 Kbps DSL service to $ 55 a month for a 150 GB cap on its 10 M bps service .
In one sense , all this cappage is a good thing .
American ISPs have always had caps .
They just did n't tell you what they were .
Nonetheless , the net neuts are n't happy .
" With Congress poised to spend billions getting Americans connected to a better , faster Internet , we 're concerned that caps discourage Internet adoption and stifle economic growth .
In general , we 're wary of any roadblock to the development of applications and services that drive experimentation and innovation online .
We need to be expanding our digital economy , not shrinking it , " reads a statement from net watchdog Free Press .
Echoing Comcast 's repeated claims , Charter says that " More than 99 per cent of current Charter Internet customers use less bandwidth than [ its new cap ] allows and therefore will not need to change their surfing habits in any manner . "
And that may be true .
But those AT&T and Time Warner caps are considerably smaller - especially Time Warner's .
A 5GB cap monthly cap at 768 Mbps and $ 1 for each additional GB ?
That far from network management .
That 's a revenue play . ®
The typical Hollywood superstar may be surrounded by fawning flunkeys who do absolutely everything for them .
But Salma Hayek , it seems , is cast in a different mould .
Touring a hospital in war - torn Sierra Leone , the 42 - year - old actress came across a mother who was unable to provide milk for her malnourished one - week - old son .
Feeding time : Salma
Hayek breastfeeds a stranger 's baby after he starts to get hungry
Without hesitation , Miss Hayek took the stranger 's baby and began breastfeeding it , despite the presence of several camera crews from American news network ABC , who were accompanying her on the African charity mission .
Mexican - born Miss Hayek , who at the time was breastfeeding her own one - year - old daughter , said : ' The baby was perfectly healthy , but the mother did not have any milk .
' He was very hungry - I was weaning my daughter Valentina , but I still had a lot of milk , so I breastfed the baby .
' It was amazing because he was really looking at me and he 's very little .
My baby is one year so he can suck a lot harder . '
Helping hand :
The actress cradles the child as she sits beside the baby 's mother
Hunger : Hayek has a one - year - old baby daughter who she is weaning
Miss Hayek , who has starred on screen alongside George Clooney and Colin Farrell , was signed up as a spokesman for Unicef last year .
Her trip was organised to help raise awareness of tetanus in Sierra Leone , the country with the highest rate of infant mortality in the world .
After the breastfeeding incident , she admitted she 'd had mixed feelings .
' I thought about it , ' she said .
Proud mother : Salma with her daughter Valentina and in glamour mode ( right )
' Am I being disloyal to my child by giving my milk away ?
I actually think my baby would be very proud to be able to share her milk .
' When she grows up , I will make sure she continues to share and be a caring and generous person . '
Wetnursing , or cross- feeding , was common practice at the beginning before the Second World War until the introduction of artificial milk .
Miss Hayek said that she had been inspired by a story of her great - grandmother .
She said : ' My great - grandmother was in a Mexican village and they found a woman in the street who was inconsolably crying and the baby was also crying .
' My great - grandmother asked what the matter was and the mother said , ' She is very , very hungry and I have no more milk ' .
' And in the street , my great - grandmother breastfed that baby who instantly stopped crying and went peacefully to sleep .
I was really impressed by that story . '
Glamourpuss : Salma is equally at ease walking the red carpets of Hollywood
The watchword in today ’s political economy is “ stimulus . ”
President Barack Obama is traveling the country to raise political support for his new plan in which the government would spend about $ 800 billion beyond what was supposed to be budgeted in the upcoming year .
That ’s a lot of money , but some people , including recent Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman , believe that the amount being proposed is too stingy .
Krugman writes that $ 800 billion is n’t “ enough to fill the looming hole in the U.S. economy , which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will amount to $ 2.9 trillion over the next three years . ”
There is term to use for someone who insists that government can costlessly come up with hundreds of billions of dollars to throw out in new spending ; it is called someone who believes in the “ fallacy of the ‘ free lunch . ”
Fortunately , Lawrence Reed dealt with this point nearly three decades ago .
He wrote :
The Garden of Eden is a thing of the distant past yet some people ( yes , even some economists ) occasionally think and act as if economic goods can come with no cost attached .
Milton Friedman is one economist who has warned repeatedly , however , that “ there is no such thing as a free lunch ! ”
Every “ something for nothing ” scheme and most “ get rich quick ” plans have some element of this fallacy in them .
Let there be no mistake about this : if economics is involved , someone pays !
An important note here regards government expenditures .
The good economist understands that government , by its very nature , cannot give except what it first takes .
A “ free ” park for Midland , Michigan is a park which millions of taxpaying Americans ( including Midlanders ) actually do pay for .
A friend of mine once told me that all one needs to know about economics is “ What is it going to cost and who is going to pay for it ? ”
That little nutshell carries a kernel of advice for the economist : do n’t be superficial in your thinking !
All of this relates to the story told by Frederic Bastiat about the young boy who becomes a “ public benefactor ” by throwing a brick through a shop window .
The people who gather after the incident become convinced that the money the shop owner has to pay to replace his window will circulate through the economy , creating new wealth , providing jobs , and generally helping to bring new prosperity .
What the crowd – like many “ sophisticated ” economists today – had forgotten is what good economists call “ opportunity cost , ” which is the value of the forgone alternative .
Since the shop keeper has to buy a window , he can’t spend his money on something else .
There is no gain to the community .
The “ lunch ” is not free precisely because it is a scarce good , and all scarce goods have an opportunity cost .
There is no way around that little truth .
Let us look at the opportunity cost of the proposed “ stimulus . ”
The “ stimulus ” will be financed by huge amounts of government borrowing , which means that taxpayers will have to pay back that amount plus interest in the future .
Furthermore , the funds raised by the huge government borrowing will be diverted from other uses .
The “ jobs ” funded by the “ stimulus ” will go to people with political connections , which imposes the real cost of politicizing the economy .
Unfortunately , President Obama and Krugman are touting the “ stimulus ” as something akin to a “ free lunch ” — as though in a free market the resources would otherwise be left idle .
They argue that unless government spends these “ new ” funds — and quickly — the economy will go into a freefall .
That is nonsense .
As Reed has eloquently noted , this kind of action imposes a real cost on the economy .
While the media no doubt will focus their coverage on the people receiving the “ benefits , ” those who have to bear the costs will be invisible .
News that the FBI has cut off contacts with the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) is attracting media and political attention .
On Thursday , the IPT broke the story that the FBI wants CAIR officials to answer questions about their organization 's un-indicted co-conspirator status in the Hamas support trial of the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development before resuming relations .
Evidence in that trial , which ended in November with the conviction of five former HLF officials on 108 counts , shows that CAIR was part of a network of Hamas support organizations in the U.S. and that founders Nihad Awad and Omar Ahmad were individually listed on a phone list of the " Palestine Committee " created by the Muslim Brotherhood for that purpose .
On Friday , five U.S. House Republicans , including the head of the bi-partisan Anti-Terrorism Caucus Sue Myrick , sent their congressional colleagues a letter with the IPT story attached .
" Members should think twice before meeting with representatives of CAIR , " the letter said .
And Fox News picked up the story , reporting that the FBI confirmed the IPT 's reporting : " An official at the FBI 's headquarters in Washington confirmed to FOX News that his office directed FBI field offices across the country to cut ties with local branches of CAIR . "
CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper declined to comment to the IPT last week .
However , CAIR issued a statement to FOX News blaming the freeze out on the Bush Administration : " It is not surprising that we would be singled out by those in the previous administration who sought to prevent us from defending the civil rights of American Muslims . "
Today , there are dozens of CBD juices that one can buy .
This can be confusing if you are a newbie and sometimes even to those who have experience buying them ....
You might want to sit down for this one .
Because when online porn companies start reducing its staff due to the economic downturn , you know times are tough .
Local porn superpower Kink.com laid off 15 % 11 % of its staff yesterday .
Founder Peter Acworth confirmed this today .
Kink.com is headquartered at the San Francisco Armory , a " 200,000 square foot 1914 reproduction of a Moorish Castle that served as a National Guard Armory and Arsenal until the 1970s . "
Is bad organizing , with Acworth at top and not much structure after , to blame ?
Alas .
Anyway , in addition to producing stellar pornographic cinema , they host parties , photo shoots , live action play , and more .
[ Inset filmed fornication joke here ]
Update : A Kink.com rep tell us that they " laid off 11 % ( 12 people ) . "
I will put this argument to rest .
at rest , the line has the stated DC voltage constantly there .
something from 40 - 70 VDC .
when someone calls your land line , the system sends a ringing pulse int he form of 120VAC , but very low amperage , so there is no risk of the wires " frying " .
This does not mean that the DC voltage is interrupted at all .
You can send two different currents over the same wire .
Your electric company does this all the time to send information either from your meter to them ( if you have the electronic thing on the meter ) or between substations or plants .
Now if you simply connected a 48 V light bulb , it would stay on steady until someone called you .
Then it would either pulse from it 's normal brightness to really bright and stop when it stopped ringing , or it will burn out .
This is where the guy in the video got the idea for the voltage regulator and bridge rectifier from .
It will not allow it to damage anything you connect to your phone jack for power usage as long as it's between the appliance and the actual phone line .
No it wo n't power much as far as appliances go , but it would power a radio , a bunch of led lights ( think rope light ) or even a small tv if you knew what you were doing .
Also , the only risk of melting wires you have is in your home , as the ones the tel company uses are quite robust for what is running through them .
Illegal ?
i doubt it , if they are dumb enough to leave lines connected on your home , which is your property , then it 's the equivalent of leaving your wallet on the sidewalk , and expecting it to stay there , and then calling someone who found it a thief .
As earlier stated , there are safeguards in place to keep a steady current draw on the line .
Not sure if that is to save their battery , or to keep open lines in fact open .
either way unless you try it with a simple bulb , you 'd never know .
just be careful .
To each his own I say .
Is Rep. Conyers corrupt ?
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
Rep. John Conyers ( MI ) has portrayed himself as a leading supporter of impeachment but in his job as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee he has blocked impeachment for years .
Conyers promised to hold impeachment hearings after the election but broke his word .
Conyers ignored a petition with over one million signatures asking for impeachment hearings .
Conyers also ignored a number of other impeachment petitions that added up to a second million or so signatures .
Now we find that Conyers was using a Republican operative involved in alleged vote rigging scams to maintain and control his congressional website .
The following articles have more :
" GOP election stealers run Rep. John Conyers ' Congressional Website . " -
http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/node/38816
and " GOP Technology Powerhouse eMerges Behind Firewalls on the Hill "
http://discuss.epluribusmedia.net/top_tier_GOP_techs_GovTech_and_GSL_Solutions_merge
There are a multitude of progressive and Democratic website specialists available who could have maintained Conyers ' website .
Why did he go to this GOP operative ?
Did Conyers have a " behind the scenes " relationship with the Republican operative ?
Does this explain Conyers ' refusal to hold impeachment hearings ?
Will we ever know ?
The only way Conyers can prove to the voters in his district that he was n't playing games with impeachment is to start impeachment hearings prior to January 20th .

LIVERPOOL children are being taught “ urban first aid ” to help friends who have been shot or stabbed .
The scheme , which has started in Kensington , could soon be rolled out across the city .
It was set up by a group of Merseyside nurses who realised youngsters did not know what to do in the wake of a shooting or stabbing .
So they qualified as British Red Cross trainers and set up a new charity to teach first aid in schools and youth clubs .
Young people are taught how to treat stab and gunshot wounds and deal with binge drinking victims .
Registered nurse Ibrahim Napson is one of seven nurses involved in the new charity .
He said : “ We had all seen various degrees of violence in Kensington .
The problem is that people tend to stand by and call an ambulance which can take five or 10 minutes and by that time the person is dead .
“ We want to help people look at what they can do before the paramedics arrive . ”
Mr Napson moved to Kensington five years ago from Ghana where he was a nurse and first aider working in a military hospital .
He now works in the casualty department at the Royal Liverpool Hospital .
Mr Napson added : “ We ’ve had a very positive reaction from the young people we have met .
“ They are more likely to be exposed to gun and knife crime .
” Some of them have told us about what it is like to see their friends with a knife or gun shot wound .
“ They were n’t able to do anything until the ambulance arrived and they found that traumatic because that time can make the difference when it comes to saving someone ’s life . ”
Mr Napson hopes the scheme can be rolled out across Merseyside and nationwide if it is a success in Kensington .
Paramedic Steve Evans , praised the project .
He who was behind the Do n’t Walk Away campaign aimed at stopping young people abandoning their friends when they are drunk , said : “ I think this charity is tremendous .
First aid is not on the national school curriculum and we also have this prevailing attitude of people not wanting to get involved .
“ We have had young people who abandon their friends because they are too scared or unable to help .
Hopefully this will change that . ”
As he prepares to take office , President - elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of a new Obama administration .
Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration .
Name : Rahm Emanuel
Chosen for : Has accepted Mr. Obama 's offer to be the White House chief of staff .
Will bring to the job :
An unusual hybrid of high - level experience as a top adviser to President Bill Clinton together with proven expertise as a Congressional leader and political strategist .
Mr. Emanuel is also a close friend of Mr. Obama , a fellow Chicagoan .
As the No. 4 Democrat in the House and an architect of the Democratic majority , Mr. Emanuel knows Congress from the inside out after winning his seat in 2002 .
In the Clinton administration , he was aggressive , frequently profane and instrumental in shaping domestic policy on issues like health care , welfare and trade .
He earned the nickname Rahmbo for his determination and take - no - prisoners approach — an advantage when trying to bring a thorny issue to resolution , but a style that can be off - putting to those accustomed to gentility .
In resigning his seat , Mr. Emanuel will be relinquishing a promising House career and aspirations to become speaker .
There may be no one better equipped and better placed than Ding to judge what is going on with the Chinese economy , financial sector and Chinese corporations .
He thinks there are big challenges ahead and everything will depend on how adroitly the Chinese leadership can move from doling out fiscal stimulus to making hard reform choices .
CICC evaded the direct sting of the financial crisis partly by accident .
The firm has consistently failed to obtain a proprietary trading licence that would have enabled it to leverage its own balance sheet for investments ( only UBS and Goldman Sachs have these licences in China ) or to trade in domestic securities .
Ding says the firm is too young and inexperienced to get seriously into the derivatives game .
This is how he sees the lessons from the financial crisis and outlook for this year , from the perspective of his client book : " Our investment banking in China is still rudimentary , basic underwriting , basic advisory work .
Our leverage is only two or three times when banks have 12 times based on 8 per cent capital adequacy requirements , and Goldmans is like 40 times .
" CICC is particularly less hurt because even for the domestic market we do n't have a principle trading licence for domestic equities .
We did n't get a chance to make a lot of money the year before , when shares went up , but we also did n't have a chance to lose money when shares went down .
" We use our capital to invest in bond paper , and Chinese bonds have been doing well because interest rates have been coming down for the last six months .
We can trade in the overseas markets but we do n't do it because we do n't feel like we have enough capacity , knowledge and risk control .
" We will be very cautious before jumping into principal trading , derivatives trading or constructing derivatives products ourselves .
You need to learn how to use them first .
" Overall we are still impacted because our client base is affected .
Our clients have to postpone , delay , shrink , reduce the size of capital raising activities .
" Most people expect the real economy will do better next year .
If that assessment is correct , I guess financial markets will rebound at least six months beforehand .
It 's still possible that we will see a reactivated IPO market in the latter part of this year though there is no assurance there .
On that we have been doing very well and continue to do well .
" M&A , of course , is more difficult .
A lot of fanfare , a lot of activity , but to close a deal and for us to make money out of it is not easy .
[ Nevertheless ]
I fully expect both the volume and money we will make will surpass last year .
" Things are really happening in debt restructuring .
And there 's massive consolidation in many sectors .
Last year we saw telecommunications .
This year we see transport , steel , shipping , even airlines , all these sectors will see consolidation .
" So we will be involved in the domestic process of consolidation but I guess we will continue overseas investment activities in some sectors - the resource sector for sure .
I think it 's a good time .
Even with losses we have suffered in first efforts , I think it 's a good time .
" With corporates , overall we are seeing shrinking profits , and most people think this first quarter will be the worst .
I think that some have already hit the bottom ; even in the steel sector we see recovery .
" In terms of large companies I think it wo n't be that bad .
It 's not so much about the central government .
Local government incentives [ for growth ] are huge .
The Chinese economy is in the hands of local governments .
" The banking sector is expanding credit rapidly .
That money will be useful .
The next stage of course one has to worry about the banking sector .
I think banks will face some pressure but it 's not likely to be as bad as before .
" The risk - control techniques , the assessment , loan recovery are all far better than before .
Second , so much of this investment is government - related , and governments never go bankrupt .
" On the investment banking side we 're seeing the volume of business going down but the client list gets longer and longer and the help they need gets greater .
Our staff are busier than ever , though we will make less money .
We will just have to be prepared to be less paid .
That 's OK , we will still live on . "
One can spend a long time in jail in the U.S. without ever being charged with a crime .

Half the population in Gaza is dependent on aid Hamas policemen have seized thousands of blankets and food parcels that were meant to be distributed to Palestinian civilians in Gaza , UN officials say .
A UN spokesman said policemen raided a UN warehouse on Tuesday after officials refused to hand over the aid to a Hamas - controlled ministry .
The UN said it was the first time its aid had been confiscated by Hamas .
It condemned the action and demanded the goods be immediately returned .
Hamas denied its men had taken any aid .
UN spokesman Christopher Gunness said Hamas police took 3,500 blankets and over 400 food parcels .
The Hamas Social Affairs Minister in Gaza , Ahmed al - Kurd , denied that members of the Islamist movement had removed aid from a UN building .
However , he said his ministry was in dispute with the UN relief agency about how aid should be distributed .
He accused the UN of giving aid to local groups with ties to Hamas opponents .
Reconstruction plan
About half the population in the Gaza Strip are dependent on UN food aid , since Israel imposed a blockade on the territory 19 months ago .
Aid delivery became increasingly difficult during Israel 's offensive against Hamas which began in late December .
The UN said it has increased its food distribution to cover 900,000 of Gaza 's population of 1.5 million .
We are stretching out our hand for peace with Israel .
But what was done is regretfully crimes of war
Mahmoud Abbas
Palestinian Authority President However , the UN , along with most of the Western world , does not deal directly with Hamas , which controls the Gaza Strip .
Meanwhile , the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) has announced $ 600 m ( £ 417 m ) for reconstruction in the Gaza Strip .
PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said the programme would cover all Palestinian houses destroyed or damaged during Israel 's 22 - day offensive in December and January .
" The amount of the project is $ 600 million .
Most of it will come from donors , " Mr Fayyad said in a speech in the West Bank city of Ramallah .
The Palestinian Authority would contribute $ 50 m of its own money to assist Gazans , he said .
Further details would be announced later , he added .
Initial Palestinian estimates said rebuilding would cost $ 2bn ( £ 1.4bn ) and take three to five years .
Meanwhile Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas , speaking to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday , said he would push for a war - crimes investigation into Israel 's attacks .
" People who committed those crimes have to be held responsible so that these crimes cannot be repeated , " he told reporters after a speech which garnered a standing ovation .
" We are stretching out our hand for peace with Israel .
But what was done is regretfully crimes of war . "
He denounced Hamas ' rocket attacks into Israel , but said " our doors are still open " for a unity government with the militant group .

How do you feel about color ?
Does black depress you ?
Does yellow lift your spirits ?
Does red make your brain scream , ' alert ! '?
According to a recent study , color might actually have a significant impact on the way we feel and the way we work -- and the findings might even help companies improve productivity as the economy continues to struggle .
In a fascinating study unveiled by University of British Columbia ( UBC ) researchers this week , certain colors were found to have drastically different effects on cognitive skills and even creativity .
According to the group 's findings , participants immersed in the color blue were able to better perform creative tasks , including those requiring problem solving and brainstorming .
Those participants exposed to bright red were not as successful creatively , but were noticeably more successful in tasks demanding memory and form , such as proofreading .
( Source : arstechnica.com )
Colors and Their Impact on Business
As you might expect , the findings could have an immense impact on the way we do business .
Companies engaged in data analysis or word editing might now be more likely to paint their offices a crimson , burgundy , or even a bright Venetian red .
Corporations involved in writing , web design , or the arts might surround their employees in deep shades of blue , like sapphire , azure , or indigo .
The most impressive part of the study is in differentiating between the two colors .
" Previous research linked blue and red to enhanced cognitive performance , but disagreed on which provides the greatest boost , " said Juliet Zhu , an author for UBC's Sauder School of Business .
Now we know that their proper use " really depends on the nature of the task . "
( Source : cbc.ca )
The differences are quite staggering , in fact .
Although researchers expected blue to enhance creativity and cognitive skills , they were surprised to find that participants exposed to shades of red actually performed the latter much better 31 per cent of the time .

Situated amid rolling hills and farms in the southern tip of Illinois , Tamms Correctional Center , the state 's only " super- max " prison , was built during the get - tough - on - crime wave that swept the nation in the 1990s .
It was designed to house the state 's most dangerous inmates .
Conditions are harsh , and meant to be .
For at least 23 hours a day , prisoners sit in solitary confinement in 7 - by - 12 - foot cells .
There is no mess hall .
Meals are shoved through a chuckhole in cell doors .
Contact with the outside world is sharply restricted .
For a rare visit from relatives or friends , inmates are strip - searched , chained to a concrete stool and separated from visitors by a thick glass wall .
There are no jobs and limited educational opportunities .
The Illinois Department of Corrections opened up this closed world to a Tribune reporter and photographer in 2009 , allowing them a glimpse at life for its 245 inmates .
Researchers have accomplished teleportation , though not of the “ Beam me up , Scotty ” variety .
Instead , they sent information between two individual atoms of the element ytterbium , which were suspended in separate containers three feet apart .
Because the quantum information instantly hops from one atom to the other without ever crossing the space between the two , scientists call the transfer “ teleportation ” [ Science News ] .
Over the years , teleportation experiments have demonstrated that quantum states – for example , the spin of a particle or the polarization of a photon – can be teleported using a variety of methods .
But the researchers behind the latest experiment … claim that this is the first time information has been teleported between two separate atoms in unconnected enclosures [ MSNBC ] .
Researchers say that atoms are a better bet than photons for storing quantum information because they ’re easier to hold on to , and say that their system could one day be harnessed for spy - proof communication using quantum cryptography , or for powerful quantum computers .
The befuddling process of quantum teleportation is made possible by the what Einstein called the “ spooky ” properties of quantum materials .
Until it ’s measured , an atom or photon can remain in an ambiguous state of all possible values simultaneously .
Whenever a particle is measured , though , this range of possibilities “ collapses ” into a single , distinct value .
The original , uncommitted state is lost , and it ’s this ability to hold multiple values at once that gives [ quantum materials ] such potential for high - performance computing [ Science News ] .
As researchers report in Science , the feat of derring - do was accomplished by first sequestering two charged ytterbium atoms in vacuum chambers three feet apart .
Researchers then zapped one of the ions with a microwave pulse that put the ion ’s electrons into a state of quantum uncertainty–using a binary framework , researchers say it was both a 1 and a 0 simultaneously .
Next they directed laser pulses lasting just a trillionth of a second at both ions , causing them to give off one photon ( packet of light ) apiece .
The wavelengths , or colors , of these photons depended on which states the electrons were in .
Crossing these photons in a beamsplitter sometimes entwined the states of those electrons , a bizarre quantum phenomenon called entanglement [ Science News ] .
Researchers determined whether the photons had become entangled by using a pair of detectors that triggered an alert only if the two photons were in a complementary state .
If they were , that meant that the ytterbium ions were also entangled .
Researchers then looked at the ion they had zapped , causing it to collapse out of its state of quantum uncertainty into one of two states , 1 or 0 .
Because the two ions were entangled , knowing the state of one gave researchers information about the state of the other .
No information was sent directly from A to B. Instead , quantum entanglement was used to put the information into ion A and get it out again through ion B [ MSNBC ] .
There ’s still a ways to go before this technology has any practical application , however .
The main problem is that the photons from the ytterbium ions only reach their fibre - optic cable once every 100 million tries — about once every ten minutes .
“ That ’s pretty sucky , ” [ physicist Paul ] Kwiat says .
“ It is embarrassing , ” admits [ study coauthor Chris ] Monroe .
It took three solid weeks of graduate students running the experiment around the clock to gather the necessary data for this paper .
Still , when the photons did find their way into the cable , the success rate for the rest of the process was an impressive 90 % [ Nature News ] .

The nature of my research and why I do it .
( Luncheon speech for Las Cruces , 14 November 1986 . )
In 1955 , as a young and promising theoretical physicist , I decided to devote my scientific life to programming instead , because I felt that programming well presented the greater intellectual challenge .
The next decade was devoted to gathering experience by designing and implementing systems of increasing size , ambition and sophistication .
By 1965 I could forcefully argue that the ability of detecting in an early stage the need for some special - purpose theory was one of the programmer 's most important assets .
Another five years later I formulated the core of the programming challenge as how to prevent the generation of unmanageable complexity .
It became clear — to me at least — that the challenge was a mathematical one .
By 1975 I had developed a formal system in which the program and its correctness proof could be designed hand in hand .
I was very excited because that was really great : another area of human endeavour had been shown to be in principle amenable to mathematical treatment .
From a purely technical point of view it is in retrospect amazing that it took me no less than two decades to reach that stage .
From a sociological point of view , this slowness is easy to understand : the conclusion was almost universally unpopular .
Programmers , and even more so their industrial managers , decried the whole idea as too academic to be of any practical significance .
( Many of them still do . )
The mathematicians ignored or denied the conclusion , because the type of mathematics was so different from what they were used to that they hardly recognized it as mathematics .
( Many of them still do n't . )
At the time I did not understand the vigour of their academic opposition , but it quickly convinced me that computing science had to develop itself the type of mathematics it needed .
In retrospect I can understand the rejection : the stress must have seemed all wrong .
In a nutshell : whereas during the last century mathematics as an intellectual discipline has become more and more knowledge - oriented , most of that knowledge was totally irrelevant for us ; for us , for instance , the choice of notation seemed much more often to be the crucial decision .
So I found myself analyzing which habits and which precautions should be cultivated for the mathematical answer to the programming challenge .
In the beginning I booked these explorations under the familiar heading of " programming methodology " .
But then all sorts of things started happening .
By virtue of its mechanical interpretability , a programming language inevitably represents a formal system of some sort , and hence program derivation is unavoidably a highly formal activity .
But this activity is only doable provided we find ways of preventing the amount of formal labour needed from exploding .
As soon as brevity became a conscious goal , one begins to ask oneself " What makes formal derivations lengthy ? "
Not surprisingly , case analysis emerges as the main culprit .
So one asks oneself " What techniques do we have for avoiding case analysis ? " .
And one finds a few , some of then sometimes even very effective .
( Later in this talk , as time permits , I shall mention some of them . )
Shortly thereafter , the reading of a well - known , generally recommended and widely used mathematical textbook leaves one completely aghast !
The arguments — and even the formulations of the theorems — are often so incredibly clumsy that one is forced to conclude one 's explorations have a bearing on mathematics in general .
Example .
In " An Introduction to Number Theory " by Harold M. Stark , a main theorem is formulated as follows :
" If n is an integer greater than 1 , then either n is prime or n is a finite product of primes . "
But 1 is certainly finite , and by defining the product of 1 factor — how else ? — to be equal to that factor we can do away with the case distinction in the consequent :
" If n is an integer greater than 1 , then n is a finite product of primes . "
But also 0 is certainly finite and by defining the product of 0 factors — how else ? — to be equal to 1 we can do away with the exception :
" If n is a positive integer , then n is a finite product of primes . "
Finally we can do away with the identifier n :
" A positive integer is a finite product of primes . "
( End of Example )
In connection with the above example I would like to stress that a clumsy formulation of a theorem is a prototype of an unfortunate interface in the sense that it tends to increase labour on both sides of the fence : it makes the theorem harder to prove and harder to use .
Thus I found myself drawn into a wider topic than just " programming methodology " .
Sometimes I call it — mainly for private purposes — " the streamlining of the mathematical argument " , sometimes I call it " mathematical methodology " , a name partly chosen to express that we were exploring to what extent the experience gained from programming methodology could be carried over to mathematics in general , and partly chosen because it reflected a shift in emphasis , viz .
from polishing existing arguments to the discipline of designing in an orderly fashion new arguments .
As time went by heuristics entered the picture .
In these activities we found a new appreciation for formalisms as an alternative to verbal thinking .
We learned that formalisms are much more than a shorthand : we now consider them as the main means for freeing ourselves from the shackles of our native tongues .
Let me give two examples of how confusing our languages are .
By the Law of the Counterpositive , A ⇒ B is the same as ¬ B ⇒ ¬A .
The implication is linguistically rendered by prefixing the antecedent with " if " , e.g .
" It will rain tomorrow if the wind does not turn . " ,
a perfectly acceptable sentence .
The counterpositive , however , yields :
" The wind turns if it wo n't rain tomorrow . " ,
a funny statement , to say the least .
Evidently , the conjunctive " if " carries with it a whole extra-logical burden of before / after or cause / effect ( a dichotomy for which there is no place in the inanimate world ) .
Verbal mathematics has learned to strip the conjunctive " if " from that extra-logical burden , but only to a certain extent , as is shown by the following example .
Logical equivalence , alias the mutual implication , is verbally rendered by " if and only if " , as in
" An integer n is even if and only if n+1 is odd . "
So far so good , but now have a look at the following sentence :
" I see with both eyes if and only if I see with one eye if and only if I am blind . " .
Linguistically , this is complete gibberish because the sentence can be parsed in two different ways .
Its blatant syntactical ambiguity prevents it from being an acceptable sentence .
Logically , it is of the form A ≡ B ≡ C and we are , indeed , free to omit the parentheses since the boolean operator of equivalence is associative : the continued equivalence means that the number of false operands is even , and since we do not have more than 2 eyes , the above statement , though baffling gibberish , is formally correct .
In mathematical reasoning , the equivalence is a grossly underexploited relation , and there is no doubt in my mind that this is closely related to the linguistic shortcomings on the verbal rendering " if and only if " .
Consequently , I have come to the conclusion that it is a mistake to teach logic by translating formulae into prose , for that is precisely the vehicle from which we want to increase our distance .
My characterization " grossly underexploited " is no exaggeration : the judicious use of the equivalence has reduced many an existing argument by an order of magnitude .
( I have seen reduction factors of 16 and 24 . )
The explanation is probably to be found in the nice properties of the equivalence , such as symmetry , associativity and the fact that disjunction distributes over it ; moreover it has the full power of equality , i.e. x = y ⇒ f.x = f.y .
Formalization , in general the reduction of a greater part of mathematics to calculation , is not our goal .
It just happened , and in this connection I would like to stress that our experience is directly opposite to what is commonly held as unshakable dogma , viz .
that formal treatments are always long , tedious , laborious , error - prone and what not .
On the contrary , a more calculational treatment has invariably led to a crisper argument .
My conclusion is that the bad name of formal techniques is undeserved .
Our experience is so striking and , at the same time so contrary to what is generally felt that you may have difficulty in believing me .
So let me venture an explanation why so many people have such poor experiences with formal mathematics .
( i) Many established notations are not well geared to our manipulative needs , e.g. by being ambiguous or by denying us the combinatorial freedom we need .
( ii ) Some calculational styles introduce many steps that are better avoided .
When using an associative operator , one may confine oneself to fully parenthesized expressions , explicitly shuffling , when needed , the parentheses by an appeal to
( X ∙ Y ) ∙ Z = X ∙ ( Y ∙ Z )
Just dropping the parentheses is much simpler .
( iii ) Many people have failed to develop sufficiently reliable handwriting : they think that formal mathematics is hard while in actual fact they only lack some simple hand - eye coordination .
It was the dream of Leibniz to reduce all of mathematical reasoning to a universally applicable calculus .
Not being Leibniz , we are more modest : we wo n't hesitate to calculate when it comes in handy .
But Leibniz needs to be mentioned in connection with computing science because it could very well be that the discipline gets the task of realizing most of his dream .
The reasons are the following :
The kind of complexity that computing scientists face makes formal techniques indispensable .
From his experience , the computing scientist is intimately familiar with the idea of manipulating uninterpreted formulae .
If the need arises , the computing scientist has the technology for mechanization at his disposal .
If ours is the task of realizing the dream of Leibniz , let us see to it that it does not turn into a nightmare !

In the largest in a series of anti-army protests this week , around 300 Mexican protesters congregated in the northern town of Monterrey Tuesday to protest army operations against drug gangs .
Another 300 protesters shut highways in the Gulf city of Veracruz .
Officials claimed that the protest was organized by drug traffickers .
Anzeige
Hundreds of Mexicans blocked roads and bridges into the United States on Tuesday in a protest of army operations against drug gangs that officials said was organized by drug traffickers .
About 300 protesters , some with handkerchiefs tied over their faces , carried signs saying " Army Get Out ! " in front of the town hall in the northern city of Monterrey , 130 miles ( 209 km ) from the Texas border .
It was the largest in a series of anti-army protests this week .
In a growing challenge to the military across Mexico , small groups of taxi drivers also blocked bridges that connect the border cities of Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo with Texas , stopping vehicles and pedestrians , police said .
Anzeige
Hundreds of miles away , another 300 people shut highways in the Gulf city of Veracruz to pressure the military to go back to their bases .
The demonstrations put fresh pressure on President Felipe Calderon to defeat the cartels after two years of an army - backed campaign and spiraling drug violence that killed 6,000 people last year .
Mexico 's drug war has scared off investors and worried the United States , which is giving $ 1.4 billion worth of equipment and other aid to help Mexico and Central America fight cartels .
Anzeige
Natividad Gonzalez , governor of Nuevo Leon state , blamed Mexico 's most violent drug gang , the Gulf cartel , and its armed wing , The Zetas , for the protests .
" There are reasons to believe it has to do with the Gulf cartel and the group known as The Zetas , " he told a news conference .
Ten people died in a gun battle between troops and drug hitmen in Reynosa on Tuesday , police said , but added that the violence was not related to the protests .
Anzeige
State police chief Aldo Fasci said last week that crime organizations were paying people to protest against the army and that gangs were handing out backpacks full of schoolbooks , pens and paper to poor families who joined the demonstrations .
RAMPANT VIOLENCE
Calderon said on Monday the rampant violence shows the drug cartels are desperate , but drug trade experts say Mexico 's deepening economic slump and rising joblessness could attract more recruits to the trade .
The northern states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas , home to Monterrey , Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa , are the main trafficking routes into Texas for the powerful Gulf Cartel .
One woman at the protest who declined to be named told Reuters she came with a neighbor who had been paid to turn up .
Calderon has sent 45,000 troops and federal police across Mexico to fight drug gangs since late 2006 , a move widely supported by Mexicans angry with years of inaction and the deep corruption in the country 's police forces .
Despite warnings from rights groups about soldiers using excessive force in the drug fight , Calderon also has Washington 's support for using the army , which has made historic drug seizures and is catching more gang leaders .
Anzeige
" Rising levels of unemployment in Mexico make it much easier for Mexican drug traffickers to recruit youths to engage in demonstrations like this , for relatively low pay , " U.S. - based security consultancy Stratfor said in a report .

Consider this :
The French Air Force failed to keep its anti-virus software up to date , and as a result the " Conficker " virus put several Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft out of commission .
Liberation has the story , translated by CNET :
Apparently in the past two weeks , some French fighter planes were grounded because the military had failed to take sufficient action ( even though Microsoft had sent advance warning ) to prevent the spread of a Windows - transmitted virus that some call Conficker and the Liberation journalist , Jean - Dominique Merchet , calls Conflicter ..
Intelligence Online ( paywall ) insists that the incident " raises serious questions about the security of French military networks and their capacity to fight off computer attacks . "
Incapacitated jet aircraft are one thing , but recently the British Royal Navy moved to use Windows XP to run its nuclear submarine fleet .
Let 's hope the British military is more thorough in its approach to network security than their French counterparts .

City Workers Accidentally Dump Hydrochloric Acid into Ohio Water Supply Instead of Toxic FluorideMike AdamsNatural NewsWednesday , Feb 4 , 2009
When you dump the wrong chemical into the public water supply , it makes people nervous .
Yesterday , chemical treatment plant workers in Bellaire , Ohio , accidentally dumped 40 pounds of hydrochloric acid into the public water supply instead of 40 pounds of toxic fluoride chemicals they were supposed to dump .
Falling fluoride levels alerted water treatment officials to the problem , and they immediately issued an alert to tell people to stop drinking the water .
The water system was then flushed by opening fire hydrants across the town to remove any trace of hydrochloric acid .
But here 's the hilarious part in all this : Hydrochloric acid is safer than fluoride !
It 's the same acid used in your stomach to digest food , and at levels of a few parts per million , it 's absolutely harmless .
The real poison in the water is the toxic fluoride being dumped into the water supply by ignorant city officials all around the world .
There is n't a shred of ( non-falsified ) evidence showing that drinking synthetic fluoride chemicals produces any health benefits whatsoever , and there 's considerable evidence that it causes tremendous harm : Fluorosis ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental ... ) , fragile bones and perhaps even increased cancer risk .
The fluoridation of public water supplies is one of the great scams of our time .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ) Besides , the fluoride dumped into public water supplies is actually an EPA - regulated toxic waste chemical .
If it were n't being dumped into the water , it would have to be disposed of through expensive toxic material handling companies .
But by selling the chemical to cities , chemical companies avoid having to dispose of it through expensive toxic waste handlers and , instead , actually make some money delivering it to brain - dead city officials who dump it into the water !
So when water treatment numnuts in Bellaire , Ohio thought they " poisoned " the water supply , they had actually produced the safest water that town has probably experienced in years !
But safe water that 's free of fluoride can't be tolerated , so they flushed it out and immediately reintroduced fluoride to the water supply .
Can't have those local townsfolk waking up from their chemically - induced dream states , can we ?
Hurry !
Dump the fluoride into the water before these people wake up from their Bingo games and TV news brainwashing !
City Workers Accidentally Dump Hydrochloric Acid into Ohio Water Supply Instead of Toxic Fluoride
I wandered into a car dealership yesterday with a few innocent questions and about twenty minutes to spare ... big mistake .
An hour and a half later I had missed a lunch , been through an ( I think unnecessary ) credit check and felt like I had been interrogated by the Gestapo .
Naturally , I decided to find out what makes car salesmen tick -- and found some wonderful information online , in particular a long article by a journalist who had gone undercover as a car salesman for three months to learn the tricks of the trade ( emphasis on tricks ) .
From " Confessions of a Car Salesman , " here are the top techniques salesmen use to get you to sign on the dotted line .
Be high - pressure because you have to be
When I was interviewed for the job , the dealership was vague about how I would be paid .
On the one hand they promised I could make serious money through commissions — maybe four or five grand my first month .
On the other hand , they alluded to an hourly wage to begin with .
Now I found that I was , in fact , working on straight commission .
If I sold cars I made money .
If I did n't sell , I did n't make a penny .
Maybe that 's why there were so many salespeople working here ( about 85 in new and used cars ) .
It did n't cost the dealership extra to have a big staff .
Use the " up to ? " trick
The process begins by asking the customer how much they want for a monthly payment .
Usually , they say , about $ 300 .
" Then , you just say , '$ 300 ... up to ? '
And they 'll say , ' Well , $ 350 . '
Now they 've just bumped themselves $ 50 a month .
That 's huge . "
You then fill in $ 350 under the monthly payment box .
Michael said you could use the " up to " trick with the down payment too .
" If Mr. Customer says he wants to put down $ 2000 , you say , " Up to ? "
And he 'll probably bump himself up to $ 2500 . "
Michael then wrote $ 2,500 in the down payment box of the 4 - square worksheet .
I later found out this little phrase " Up to ? " was a joke around the dealership .
When salesmen or women passed each other in the hallways , they would say , " Up to ? " and break out laughing .
Create a sense of urgency
After the customer test - drove the car we brought them into a sales office and offered them coffee or a Coke to relax them .
Then we filled in the information about the car [ on the sales sheet ] ... and called the tower [ the sales managers ] .
Michael held his hand like a phone receiver with his thumb and little finger sticking out .
" You say , ' Yes sir .
I have the Jones family here with me and they have just driven a beautiful new whatever model , stock number blah blah blah . '
Then you say , ' Is it still available ? '
Of course you know it is .
But you want to create a sense of urgency .
So you pause , then say to the customer , ' Great news !
The car 's still available !'
" Never give the customer even numbers . "
" Here 's another thing .
Never give the customer even numbers .
Then it looks like you just made them up .
So do n't say their monthly payment is going to be $ 400 .
Say it will be $ 427 .
Or , if you want to have some fun , say it will be $ 427.33 . "
Steal the trade - in
At one point he said , " Oh !
This is a good one !
This is how you steal the trade - in . "
He looked around quickly to make sure no one overheard him .
" When you 're getting the numbers from the desk , they 'll ask if the customer has a trade - in .
Say it 's a ' 95 Ford Taurus .
And say you took it to the used car manager and he evaluated it and said he would pay four grand for it .
If you can get the trade for only three , that 's a grand extra in profit .
" So what you do is this , " Michael pretended to pick up the phone again , " you ask the desk , ' What did we get for the last three Tauruses at auction ? '
Then they 'll give you some figures — they 'll say , $ 1,923 , $ 2,197 and $ 1,309 .
You do n't have to say anything to the customer .
But he sees you writing this down !
And he 's going , ' Holy crap !
I thought my trade was worth $ 6,000 . '
Now it 's easy to get it for $ 3,000 .
That 's a grand extra in profit .
And it 's front - end money too ! "
( I later learned that front - end money was what our commissions were based on .
Back - end money was made on interest , holdbacks and other elements of the deal . )
Get them off the lot
" You 're walking through the lot with Mr. Customer and he 's eyeballing all these cars , " Oscar said .
" He stops next to this one and bam !
that 's the one you 're gonna sell him .
You pull it out of the row , open the doors and ask him to see how good the seats feel .
When he sits down you slam the door and take off . "
" You mean , you ask him if he wants to demo the car ? " I asked .
" Hell no .
They never go for a demo if you ask them .
' Cause they know they 're weak .
If they drive it they 'll buy it .
The feel of the wheel will seal the deal , my friend .
So you got to kidnap them , man .
Just slam the door and take off .
Come on , let 's go . "
We got into the car and he palmed the wheel , backing up , then pulling out onto the street .
A block later we hit a light .
When it turned green Oscar punched it and I felt the G's pressing me back into the leather .
" Whoa , " I said .
" Great torque . "
" Strong , " he agreed , checking the review mirror .
We made a right , then another right into a shopping center parking lot .
We got out .
" Now you got them away from the dealership , you can relax a little , show 'em how awesome this car is .
What you want to do is open all the doors and windows , the hood and the trunk .
Then you do your walk around .
You start at the driver 's door and you point stuff out as you go .
' Mr. Customer , this car 's got the highest safety rating because it 's got front crumple zones and breakaway engine mounts .
It 's got a 170 - horsepower V6 with four valves per cylinder and blah , blah , blah . '
See , it does n't really matter what you say — most people do n't even know what the hell you 're talking about -— but the important thing is to keep talking : ' Here 's the headlights , here 's the gas cap .
Here 's the trunk .
Here are the tires . '
Anything !
Understand ? "
It all starts with the handshake
Over the next few days I noticed that car salesmen shook hands with each other a lot .
I shook hands with each of my team members when I arrived in the morning ; we shook hands before we left the dealership at night .
We might shake hands with each other two or three more times during the day .
If I happened to be standing on the curb and if another salesman walked up I shook hands with him .
It was like we were all staying loose , practicing on each other , for that moment when we would greet Mr. Customer and needed to use a good handshake that 's going to seal the deal .
At one point , during a sales seminar , I was actually taught how to shake hands .
The instructor , a veteran car salesman said : " Thumb to thumb .
Pump one , two , three , and out . "
Another vet told me to combine the handshake with a slight pulling motion .
This is the beginning of your control over the customer .
This would prepare the " up " to be moved into the dealership where the negotiation would begin .
The car lot handshake is sometimes combined with the confident demand , " Follow me ! "
If you employ this method you turn and begin walking into the dealership .
Do not look back to see if they are following you .
Most people feel the obligation to do what they are told and they will follow you , if only to plead , " But I 'm only looking ! "
Make 'em laugh -- if you can
Many salespeople find that humor is a good way to overcome objections .
If a customer says they 're " only looking , " the salesperson might answer , " Last time I was only looking I wound up married . "
If a customer objects to being hurried into buying the car , the salesperson might say , " The only pressure on this lot is in the tires . "
These prepackaged lines were exchanged between car salesmen in the slow times with the feeling that the right joke at the right moment could be the ticket to a sale .
Of course , a good joke in the salesman 's opinion might be considered the ultimate cornball line by the customer .
In one case a veteran salesman bragged to me that he sold a car to a woman by telling her , " You know , you look great in this car .
The color matches the color of your eyes . "
Oddly enough , that very night I was talking to a woman who told me she had once had a car salesman tell her that the car matched the color of her eyes .
Her reaction to this ?
" Oh please ! "
It 's just like Glengarry Glen Ross
Compare this sales meeting with Alec Baldwin 's famous , brilliant , and NSFW speech from David Mamet 's masterpiece , Glengarry Glen Ross .
I think you 'll find more than a few similarities .
Another incumbent Senate Republican bowing out Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday January 8 , 2009
Print This Email This Senator Kit Bond ( R - MO ) has just announced that he will not seek reelection when his term expires two years from now .
Bond told the Missouri General Assembly on Thursday , " In 1972 , I became Missouri 's youngest Governor .
Good friends , I do not aspire to become Missouri 's oldest Senator . "
The Politico calls Bond 's announcement " a blow to Senate Republicans " and " a sign that 2010 could be another tough cycle for the weakened GOP minority . "
Two other prominent Republican senators , Mel Martinez of Florida and Sam Brownback of Kansas have also announced their retirement , raising the possibility of additional Democratic gains in 2010 which could create a filibuster - proof majority .
There is also speculation that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison might run for governor of Texas , which would create a fourth vacancy .
Missouri has recently been a battleground state .
Senator Claire McCaskill defeated incumbent Republican Jim Talent there in 2006 .
In 2008 , although Barack Obama narrowly lost to John McCain by 5000 votes , the state elected a Democrat to succeed retiring Republican governor Matt Blunt .
The Politico speculates that a number of prominent Republicans might be interested in the seat , including Talent , former House Majority Whip Roy Blunt , and others .
Blunt , who is the father of outgoing Governor Matt Blunt , is considered to have the edge if he decides to run .
On the Democratic side , Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan , the daughter of the late Governor Mel Carnahan , is described as having " been laying the groundwork for a campaign for weeks . "

Christmas is more fun for kids than for anybody else .
For them it's the holiday time to have fun , play games in the snow , meet with friends and family , eating delicious candies and cakes , get involve in Christmas decorations , receive gifts , waiting for Santa Claus and singing Christmas carols and poems .
Christmas poems are a way for the children
to
know more about the Christian traditions and their importance .
So it becomes essential for the parents to impart them with this knowledge about Christmas apart from all the fun activities .
We present some of the Christmas poems for kids that have easy words for them to grab their meaning :
I Believe In Santa
Having faith in Santa Claus
Is not for just the young ,
I know I 'll keep proclaiming him
As long as I 've a tongue .
And even though I see the gent
Unmasked before my eyes ,
Revealing some familiar friend
Who 's donned the quaint disguise ,
It does n't change my mind a bit ;
I 'll still believe , because
There 's more than whiskers and a suit
To dear old Santa Claus ;
Bright hopes there are ,
And dreams come true ,
Good cheer , unselfish sharing
Personified by gifts of love
Within the pack he 's bearing .
To call these angels " Santa Claus "
Is surely not deceiving ,
So I , for one , will never scoff
But go right on believing .
A Child's Christmas Eve Dream
Last night I had a lovely dream ,
But strange as it could be ,
For on the hill beside our house
Stood a great Christmas tree .
It glowed with lighted candles ,
High at the top , a star ,
And 'round it , dancing in a ring ,
Children from lands afar .
There were polite , little English girls ,
Swiss boys with funny skis ,
Dutch children in queer wooden shoes ,
Joined hands with shy Chinese .
Turkish lads is tassled fez ,
Tots from France and Greece and Poland ,
Laughing as the children do
In the safety of a free land .
Perhaps my dream 's a prophecy
Of Christmases to be ,
When little children everywhere
Can sing because they 're free .
I surely wish with all my heart ,
This day of Jesus ' birth ,
That peace and love and happiness
Soon cover all the earth .
Enjoy and Merry Christmas

Hope and Change Ca n’t Keep Rats from Eating Cars on U Street was originally published on City Desk on Feb. 04 , 2009 , at 12:32 pm
Some time ago , City Desk featured a story about Adams Morgan resident Sid Binks , who had a rat problem .
The rats ate through his ignition wires and his new car would n’t start .
Mr. Binks , you have company down at 15th and U. Sylvia Keys , a calligrapher who ’s lived in a condo there for 18 years , recently posted to the U Street Listserv that she finally scored an alley parking spot and , guess what ?
There are rats in the alley .
And guess what else ?
They are “ living , eating and partying on our motors .
And leaving ‘ debris ’ behind , ” Keys writes .
And that ’s not all : “ My taillight went out and the dealer said that rats had been chewing away the wires , thus costing me $ 200 .
And yes , the dealership did find a dead rat baby around my motor . ”
There ’s no way she ’s giving up her spot in “ a very nice , newly bricked , alleyway ” to battle the masses on 15th Street again .
So she turned to the Listserv for help .
The Listserv directed her to D.C. vermin czar Gerard Brown , who has a lot on his to - do list , including , as our almost - old cover story points out , bedbugs .
So what ’s a lady calligrapher to do ?
Well , Binks ’ mechanic wrapped steel wool around vulnerable wires , which seemed to help .
Another option ?
Move .
Sylvia Keys may have found U Street before it became Obama - cool , but so did the rats and they ’ll outlast even two terms of the re-re - re - rebirth of U Street .
Corn ethanol is no better fuel than gasoline , and it may even be worse for air quality , according to a new University of Minnesota study .
The study , released Monday , is the first one to estimate the economic costs to human health and well - being from three different fuels -- gasoline , corn - based ethanol and cellulosic ( plant - based ) ethanol -- its authors say .
Scientists and economists looked at life - cycle emissions of growing , harvesting , producing and burning different fuels , and concluded that ethanol made from switchgrass and other plant materials is far better than either corn ethanol or gasoline .
" Our study shows that if we 're really going to make choices in the best interest of the public , we need to look not only at what 's cheapest to produce , but what are the costs to the public in terms of environmental and health effects , " said Jason Hill , research associate in applied economics and a resident fellow at the U's Institute on the Environment .
Ethanol is a $ 6 billion industry in Minnesota , according to state estimates .
The Minnesota Department of Agriculture calculated that the 17 ethanol plants in the state produced 670 million gallons of ethanol in 2007 and provided 26,000 " direct impact " jobs .
The university 's study will be published in this week 's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and was posted online on Monday afternoon at the PNAS site .
No love from ethanol backers
Ethanol advocates said they have n't seen the study and will need time to understand how the conclusions were reached .
" I 'm stifling a yawn , " said Mark Hamerlinck , communications director for the Minnesota Corn Growers Association .
" It would be news if the university had anything positive to say about corn ethanol .
It 's how they make a living over there . "
Its a quiet night on Stevens Pass .
No trains , no snow falling , no sounds .
The only thing that breaks the eery silence is a little ballast regulator - turned - snow - plow as it struggles to move back the right - of - way .
Katy Perry - on the set of American Idol in Honolulu
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Treasury could consider a second round of capital investments in banks in the second phase of its $ 700 billion financial rescue fund , but also needs to set aside money for systemically significant institutions , a senior Treasury official said on Tuesday .
Neel Kashkari , the Treasury ’s interim assistant secretary for financial stability , said the second half of the bailout fund needs to stay focused on the financial sector .
“ It ’s impossible to predict what ’s going to happen .
We hope that the actions that we ’ve taken are sufficient , but we ’re we are also going to have enough dry powder on the side to deal with any one - offs that arise , ” Kashkari told business students at Georgetown University .

Professional PDF documents can make or break a marketing campaign , or advertising promotion , or even seal the deal with a client .
For most people this job is done with either QuarkXPress or Adobe Reader .
Both outstanding tools with a high price .
Did you know , however , there was an open source tool that can do the job as well and even a little bit easier ?
Yes there is .
Scribus is the name of the tool .
It 's open source , cross platform , and best of all - free !
The feature list for Scribus will impress you .
Supports most image file formats
CMYK and ICC color management support
Printing via level 3 postscript
Transparency support
Layer support
Encryption support
Interactive PDF support
And much more ...
Getting and Installing Scribus is simple .
Fire up your Add / Remove utility , do a search for " scribus " , select the results , and apply the changes .
Once Scribus is installed you will find it in either your Office or your Graphics menu ( depending upon which desktop you use ) .
When you first fire up Scribus you will be greeted by a simple New Document " wizard " .
This wizard allows you to choose from various layouts , page sizes , margins , etc .
It 's not until you are actually working in a document that you can see the power of Scribus .
As you can see ( in the image to the left ) Scribus can create complex documents .
The document you see is actually a single - layered document .
This particular document is a template that can be downloaded from the Scribus web site .
Personally I would have done this with multiple layers in order to simplify the creation of the document .
Creating such a complex single - layered document also makes it hard to select and manipulate individual elements .
Layering is probably one of the key features of Scribus , and one you should definitely grow accustomed to .
You treat layers in Scribus as you would in The GIMP , QuarkXPress , Publisher , or any quality print - ready tool .
Once you start playing around with Scribus you will discover useful feature after useful feature .
There are features that you will certainly use more than others .
The text editor tool , for example , is where you create and edit the text you place in text frames .
Scribus also has some good support paths including :
Wiki
IRC
Mailing list
Bug tracker
There is also a documentation page on the Scribus site .
This page has quite a bit of information on using Scribus .
The Downside
The only downside Scribus has is that it can not import other proprietary formats .
This was a choice that the Scribus team made because they felt like importing other formats would comprimise the integrity of the original document .
In reality this is a smart move , because it wo n't make Scribus look like it can not handle Adobe Pagemaker , QuarkXPress , or Microsoft Publisher formats .
You can , however , import SVG , EPS / PS documents into Scribus .
Final Thoughts
I have used Scribus from everything to simple fliers , to complex marketing brochures , to books .
I am always amazed at the power of this tool as well as the versatility .
If you are looking for an application to create impressive PDF documents , and you want to do so either on all platforms or on a budget , Scribus is the perfect application for the job .
Scribus is the perfect solution to your desktop publishing needs .

SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
N aturally , the law enforcement sources who utilized Cameron 's investigation to voice their concerns did n't dare allow their names to be used : as Cameron related in his report , any question regarding the possibility of Israeli spying in the US is " career suicide " for those who dare raise it .
Question : is it also career suicide for journalists to raise it ?
I have seen a few news items reporting on the Cameron exposé , but , given the implications and scope of what we 're talking about here , the answer is , apparently , yes .
For Cameron and Fox News are not merely saying that the Israelis have been conducting a " sprawling " spy operation in the US , involving the massive penetration of our communications systems and government agencies .
As Cameron so diplomatically put it in the first segment of his four - part investigation : " There is no indication that the Israelis were involved in the 9 - 11 attacks , but investigators suspect that the Israelis may have gathered intelligence about the attacks in advance , and not shared it . "
A GUILTY SILENCE I n other words : Israel 's passive complicity made the worst terrorist attack in American history possible .
One would think that the sheer enormity of such a charge would provoke a storm of outrage from Israel 's many defenders in the media : the columnists , the think - tankers , the publicists who dote on Ariel Sharon 's every word .
But , no : instead , there is an ominous , one might almost say a guilty silence .
THANKS BE TO GOOGLE !
I t's frightening , really , when you think about it .
Here , after all , is a reporter 's dream : a heretofore - undiscovered angle on the biggest story of our time .
Yet no one will touch it .
Why ?
It could n't be because you 'd need an army of researchers : you do n't .
All that 's necessary is internet access , and , of course , the miracle of Google : anyone can go to google.com and type in the appropriate words and phrases , such as " Israelis detained , " or , better yet , " Israeli art students " along with the word " detained . "
Go ahead : do it , and see what happens … .
ARTISTIC ASPIRATIONS
O kay , so you did it and came up with a whole slew of news stories , published mostly in local newspapers , telling different variations on a single , very bizarre story :
In locations as diverse as Dallas , Saint Louis , Kansas , Atlanta , New York , and Findley , Ohio , groups of young people describing themselves as Israeli art students suddenly descended on federal office buildings and no less than 36 Department of Defense facilities .
They seemed particularly active in the state of Texas : in Dallas , one " student " was found wandering the halls of a federal facility with a floor plan in his hands .
Say , what ?
Starting in the third week of January , reports began to pour in to the National Counterintelligence Center ( NCC ) about " suspicious visitors to federal facilities . "
The NCC 's bimonthly report for March 2001 states : " In the past six weeks , employees in federal office buildings located throughout the United States have reported suspicious activities connected with individuals representing themselves as foreign students selling or delivering artwork .
Employees have observed both males and females attempting to bypass facility security and enter federal buildings . "
INVASION OF THE 'ART STUDENTS '
T he NCC described these people -- supposedly working for an outfit known as " Universal Art , Inc. " -- as " aggressive " in attempting to gain access to federal facilities , and reported that two had been arrested for having counterfeit work visas and green cards .
Then this stunner : " These individuals have also gone to the private residences of senior federal officials under the guise of selling art . "
Now wait just a friggin ' minute , dude  stop right there !
OMINOUS PORTENTS
O kay , so we 're talking about some nine months before The Day , and mysterious " art students " are following high government officials home  that is , when they are n't trying to break in to Defense Department facilities , staking out DEA offices , and hanging around the federal prosecutor 's office in Dallas .
We 've already had numerous terrorist scares , at this point : remember the New Year 's hysteria , and there were all those frantic warnings by various " anti-terrorist " commissions and study groups .
The NCC report posits the existence of two groups of " art students " : " One group has an apparently legitimate money - making goal while the second , perhaps a non-Israeli group , may have ties to a Middle Eastern Islamic fundamentalist group . "
So , this was the first ominous sign of the terrorist onslaught to come  or was it ?
The NCC 's speculation that these " art students " were Bin Laden 's boys turns out not to have been correct .
They were Israelis , alright , except for a few Latin Americans .
Not only did they carry forged immigration papers , in some cases , but also at least one we know about failed a polygraph test when he denied spying for Israel .
CELLMATES AT LAST
W ith some 140 picked up before 9/11 , and some 60 - plus afterward , we have no idea how many of these " art students " were sent back to Israel to pursue their " studies . "
All we know is that those let go were kept for months , and others  according to Fox News , those identified as Israeli agents  are still in custody , perhaps sharing a nice cozy cell with detainees from Arab countries .
I 'm sure they have a lot to talk about … .
HOW ODD T he Arab detainees , as we have seen , have been the subjects of a national controversy between civil libertarians and the Bush administration .
We have John Ashcroft denouncing those who would spread the " false fear " of a police state as " aiding the terrorists , " while on the other hand Arab - Americans and the ACLU are rallying opposition to the round - up .
But when it comes to the Israeli detainees , there is no controversy , virtually no mention of it in the national media , no nothing .
Jewish groups are not rallying to the defense of these poor defenseless " art students , " held without bail and without lawyers , for the most part , in very uncomfortable and worrisome circumstances .
Does n't anybody find this odd ?
SUCKER PUNCH
W hat 's significant about this story is , first , that it amounts to the biggest spy operation in the US since the days of the Cold War , and , secondly , that it provides some context for understanding the mystery of 9/11 .
To most of us , that horrific event was a bolt out of the blue , with no prelude , no precedent , and no way to anticipate that the best days of our lives could turn into the worst .
But the view from inside the US Government must have looked a whole lot different , i.e. far more threatening .
Yet the threat seemed to be coming , not from Bin Laden , but  incredibly  from the Israelis , who , not content with having gained access to our phone system and federal wiretaps , were penetrating American military and government targets .
Law enforcement authorities were in the midst of a massive crackdown on the Israelis , when , suddenly , they were hit  from the other direction .
IN THE DARK W e are being kept in the dark about so many things , these days , but this , it seems , is too important to be kept secret for long .
If we are going to be asked to give up our liberties , our peace of mind , and even our lives in an apparently eternal " war on terrorism , " then Americans at least have a right to know who their enemies are .
Yes , we know the evil Bin Laden is responsible for the murder of 3000 innocent people  but we still do n't know how they managed to pull off such a well - organized and spectacular display of murderous skill , unassisted by any state sponsor .
A CAROLINA COVEN M uch has been said  but nothing proved  about the alleged role of Iraq in all this .
But to anyone who has seen or read through parts one , two , three and four of the Fox News investigative report , it seems clear that the most active state intelligence agency in the US prior to the twin towers attack was not the Iraqis , but the Mossad .
Carl Cameron informs us that a North Carolina Israeli spy coven is suspected of renting an apartment in California " to spy on a group of Arabs who the United States is also investigating for links to terrorism . "
What were they doing  and , most importantly , what did they know about the planning and execution of the 9/11 atrocity ?
DEMAND AN INVESTIGATION
I n the months preceding 9/11 , a secret war was being waged on American soil , a silent struggle from coast to coast  not an undercover battle between us and Muslim terrorists , but one pitting US law enforcement agencies against one of our closest allies .
Make of that what you will .
For until the US government comes clean , and Congress investigates , we 'll never even have a chance to start asking the right questions .

Legal info
Most browsers enable the user to print web pages by simply pressing the print button .
Unfortunately if the page to be printed is not a ‘ print version ’ then often the advertisements and graphics are also printed , which means you consume more ink .
On top of that most web pages are n’t aligned for printing , resulting in large chunks of white spaces to be printed and sometimes text on the right hand side of the page is chopped off .
This article provides advice on the tools and applications you can use to edit web pages prior to printing from Internet Explorer , Firefox , Safari and iPhones to ensure that only relevant information is printed .
Internet Explorer
Even though Internet Explorer has been around for many years and still commands the lion ’s share of browser market share , albeit a diminishing share , there is a lack of tools to help you print more efficiently and save printer inks .
So if you are using Internet Explorer for your browsing then you ’ll have to rely much more heavily on websites providing printer friendly versions of their content or use one of these tools to format content before sending it to be printed .
1. PrintWhatYouLike.com :
This is a free tool that enables you to format the web page before sending it to the printer without having to copy it into MS Word .
You can even remove adverts , widgets and other information you do n’t require , therefore printing only what you need .
The great advantage of this tool is that you do n’t have to download any application as it runs off your browser .
You can even change the font - type and settings and combine multiple web pages to save on paper when printing .
2. Print Punk :
This is a plug - in for Internet Explorer which automatically resizes a web page to fit the printer paper .
Although this product is not freeware , it is well worth the $ 19.95 as not only does it resize the page , but it will also fix page problems like ensuring that the right hand side of the page is n’t cut off during the print .
It can also auto fit the page to the Internet Explorer window , as well as enabling the user to zoom into and out of web pages on the screen for easy viewing .
Firefox
When it comes to extensible browsers , it ’s hard to beat Firefox .
As you would expect there are many add - ons available that make printing content from the internet easier .
Here are the best , and they ’re all free to download and use !
3. Print Hint : The Print Hint extension for Firefox is a very handy tool which automatically detects whether the loaded web page is printable , or whether there is a linked web page which contains the print version of the web page .
By clicking on the print icon , the print version is automatically loaded to eliminate the hassle and wasted ink when printing unnecessary information like logos and advertisements from Firefox browsers .
4. Remove It Permanently : The Firefox add - on , Remove It Permanently ( RIP ) , is a very popular extension which is used to remove unwanted content from web pages making the content printer - friendly .
RIP can remove both graphics and text , including tables and copyright notices .
Best of all it removes all empty spaces , even from where you have removed page elements , so that printer paper is not wasted when printing .
5. HP Smart Web Printing : Another great free application which can be used with both Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers is the HP Smart Web Printing tool .
It gives the user full control over the material to be printed as they can select both graphic and text content from multiple sites to be printed on a single page .
The data can then be edited and then printed .
You can even store the edited file .
Safari
Apple ’s KHTML - based browser is n’t nearly as extensible as Firefox , but there are plug-ins that make printing much more economical .
6. Safari Magic :
This essential plug - in offers the perfect solution to all printing problems when printing from the Safari web browser .
It enables you to remove information from the web page that you do n’t want to print , organise and incorporate text , graphics and pictures from multiple web pages and you can even add your own notes - all through the built in editor .
This tool also ensures that content is not cut off during printing .
Although Safari Magic is not free , the minimal fee of $ 19.95 is still good value for money considering the many features it offers .
7. Word Browser Plug - In : A must have Safari plug - in for all OS users who do not have MS Word installed on their machines is the Word Browser Plug - In , which allows you to view and print all MS Word documents from within the Safari browser .
The downside to this plug - in is that it does not display or print any included graphics , but at least you can quickly print any MS Word documents without having to open up any additional applications .
iPhone
No longer is a phone just a phone .
You can send and receive email , and even surf the web - but how do you print from your iPhone ?
Fortunately there are several applications that enable wireless iPhone printing .
How useful is that !
8. HP iPrint Photo : HP recently released the iPrint Photo application which enables users of the Apple iPhone or iPod Touch to print 4 x 6 inch photographs where these devices are connected to an HP printer via a Wi -Fi network .
Unfortunately the print application is restricted to photographs , so unless you have a photo printer such as an Photosmart or DeskJet the current version may not actually be what you need .
However , for someone who takes a lot of photos and has a compatible HP printer , iPrint Photo is a handy app to have on your iPhone .
9. EuroSmartz Print :
If you need to print web pages ; your contacts or photographs from your iPhone , EuroSmartz Print application will do just that .
At a minimal cost of $ 3 , this application can be downloaded from their site onto your computer or laptop .
To print , all you need to do is connect your iPhone to the computer and then print using the available printers .
These are just a few of the incredibly useful tools and add - ons for browsers and iPhones to make printing web pages much easier .
So if you want to save paper when printing , have more control over the content to be printed or even print content from multiple sites on single pages , try one of these tools .
You will not be disappointed .

“ That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of [ life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ] , it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it … ” ~ Declaration of Independence of the American Colonies , 1776
Dear Federal Government ,
Drop dead .
Excuse us .
Some may consider such bluntness to be indecorous , but why beat around the bush ?
In any case , we ’ve been around this bush ( Bush ? ) too many times to count already .
It ’s time to let you know what we really think of you , what we say behind your back , what we whisper to each other when you leave the room .
We hate you .
We want you to drop dead .
Or , anyway , to go away and never come back .
You are not welcome anymore .
We have tolerated you — and we emphasize “ tolerated ” — for a long time , long after whatever romance there may have been was gone .
We can pretend no more .
You are disgraceful , boorish , nauseating , corrupt , shameful , arrogant , dishonest , self - serving , parasitic , disgusting , hypocritical , and rotten to the core .
You have not even one redeeming quality .
There is nothing you offer that we want any longer .
We ’re not even sure what it is we ever saw in you to begin with .
We suppose you can be forgiven if this letter comes as a shock .
“ Why , ” you say , “ what do you mean ?
I still command great respect and inspire widespread adulation .
And I still care about you .
Is n’t it obvious ? ”
It ’s true that , in public , we often nod our heads and agree with you , even defer or appear to defer to you .
But we assure you that this happens not out of respect ; rather , it arises merely from the fact that you have a lot of guns and a bad temper .
Inside , we are seething and resentful .
Inside , we imagine your demise in the most vivid and gratifying of ways .
We may fear your irrational and violent behavior , but we manifestly do not respect or agree with you .
We do n’t love you .
We do n’t even like you .
( See the part about hate , above . )
At any rate , our revulsion toward you has finally come to outweigh any fear we have of you .
We refuse to keep our real feelings in for even one more second .
We want you gone from our lives .
And we mean completely .
Vamoose .
Go. Die .
Please understand we are n’t here to argue .
No special new subsidy , tax break , or privileged “ loophole ” is going to sway our opinion or make us change our minds about this .
We ’ve been there , done that , for too many decades to count now .
Likewise , your threats are starting to make us yawn and even laugh .
You see , we know all your tricks now .
We can see through your lies because we ’ve heard them all so many times before .
We are fully aware of your true nature , and we see that that nature is radioactive evil , wrapped in a tattered blanket of ignorance , foolishness , and stupidity .
Look , we know it ’s only a matter of time anyway .
Your dimwittedness , greed , fraudulence , and moral bankruptcy are finally starting to catch up to you .
Even your former employees admit as much .
Do you remember Paul Craig Roberts , one of your past Treasury officials ?
Today he says of your latest economy - wrecking and warmongering efforts :
“ The world has never seen such total mindlessness .
Napoleon ’s and Hitler ’s marches into Russia were rational acts compared to the mindless idiocy of the United States government . ”

Around 20 council heads are believed to earn more than the prime minister Councils in England will be forced to publish information on how much their chief executives earn under planned legislation , the government has said .
Local Government Minister John Healey said the " spiralling " pay of some council chiefs needed to be countered .
But David Clark of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives said that his members carried out " big complex jobs requiring people of real talent " .
English council tax bills will rise by 3 % on average , a BBC survey suggests .
The study by the leading accountancy body CIPFA , based on returns from nearly 75 % of councils , indicates that the average band D home bill will rise by just over £ 40 to £ 1,414 .
' Pay - offs for failure '
Across the country , around 20 council heads are believed to earn more than the prime minister .
While Gordon Brown receives an annual salary of £ 194,000 , the heads of Newham and Wandsworth councils earn more than £ 240,000 each year .
If that was a private sector job , they would have three times the income
David Clark
Society of Local Authority Chief Executives
But many local authorities raise legal objections to attempts to find out details of some of the top earners , while others require formal Freedom of Information requests .
Mr Healey said the government had decided to legislate to reveal the full picture of what senior councils officers are paid .
" We 've seen in some councils ' salaries spiralling , we 've seen some big pay - offs for failure , and that can't go on , " he said .
" I think the public need to know the full picture .
That 's why I 'm going to change the rules . "
Philosophy change Earlier this month the Conservatives , also said councils should be forced to publish detailed information on expenditure , including senior staff 's pay and perks , and proposed guidance to stop " rewards for failure " for sacked staff .
But Mr Clark said local authority chief executives were worth their salaries .
" The average shire county , for example , employs 22,000 people , " he said .
" If that was a private sector job , they would have three times the income . "
It is not only councils which have seen large top - level wage rises - one housing association chief executive took home £ 327,000 in the last financial year , while the highest - paid official at Transport for London earned £ 540,000 - including a pay - off .

The moves come amid increasing scrutiny of salaries in the private sector , which have been used in recent years as a justification for big increases in the wages of local government chiefs .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said he is " very angry " about proposed bonuses for executives at banks bailed out by the taxpayer .
And ministers have condemned former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin for keeping his £ 16 m pension pot .
The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy ( CIPFA ) survey found that London is set to see the lowest council tax rises over the next year , of just over 1 % , but bills in the South West and North East will rise 3.5 % .
Above inflation Inflation is currently 3 % when measured by the official Consumer Price Indexes measure , but is expected to fall further .
And the Retail Prices Index , an inflation measure which includes mortgage costs and is often used in wage negotiations , has already fallen to 0.1 % .
The latest research by CIPFA suggests that several councils in London are freezing or even cutting bills in response to the economic climate .
The government has said " excessive " increases in bills will not be tolerated and they urged councils to make further savings to ensure that core services are not affected during the recession .
The Conservatives have said they will freeze council tax for two years if they are elected .
The Liberal Democrats say they would scrap council tax altogether and replace it with a new local tax , based on income rather than the value of a person 's home .

Top 10 Moments in Professional Athlete Generated Video ( PAGV ) … of All Time
by Brendan Lopez
It 's no secret that consumer generated video ( CGV ) has spread like wildfire over the past several years .
The people making these videos were once primarily tech - savvy individuals , but nowadays , anyone with an Internet connection can easily share their story ( or strategically placed screenshot of cleavage ) with the world .
In the spirit of this month 's Superbowl , however , I wanted to call attention to a group of consumer video generators who only rarely get their moment in the web video sun : professional athletes .
Although not all of their videos are exactly Oscar caliber , and I can't exactly respect any video that features Shaquille O'Neil rapping , it 's not everyday we get to witness the creativity ( or attempts at creativity ) of professional athletes .
# 10 Shaq Disses Vlade Divac
The Background
Shaquille O'Neal is arguably one of the NBA 's most dominant basketball players of all time .
In 2002 , Shaq and the Lakers crushed Vlade Divac and the Sacramento Kings in the Western Finals .
While winning graciously would certainly be admirable , and appropriate behavior for a pop culture icon , the Shaq Daddy has never cared for societal expectations .
See his breakout performance in 1996's Kazaam for further illustration .
The Video
While hanging out in the back of his team bus , Shaq created a handheld music video with a special message for Vlade Divac .
The video prominently features the Cheers theme song , an unexpected artistic choice by Shaq Daddy that probably speaks to some underlying symbolism .
For those of you who can't get enough of Shaq - flavored melodies after watching the clip below , I 'd recommend picking up a VHS copy of Kazaam immediately .
Sure , it 's over a decade old and reeking of mid-nineties schmaltz , but how often do you get a chance to see a hip - hop rapping genie of Shaqular proportions ?
# 9 Terry Tate : Office Linebacker
The Background
Lester " Mighty Rasta " Speight is a triple threat .
He 's a football player , professional wrestler , and television actor ( appearing in such shows as Arli$ $ , Malcolm in the Middle , and Prison Break ) .
And although he looks like one of the most intimidating dudes you 'll ever catch on Youtube , he apparently packs some legit comedic chops .
Case in point : his performance in Terry Tate : Office Linebacker .
The Video
Although this Reebok series originally aired during the 2003 Super Bowl , it found its true home ( and massive viewership ) online .
Speight plays Terry Tate , a football player hired by an office to increase workplace productivity .
Tate encourages employees to respect each other 's property and get their work done on time .
What are his tactics , you ask ?
Well , he violently attacks them and screams until they basically wet their pants .
It 's safe to say that most companies would be two to three times as efficient if they brought Tate into their office .
I know I 'd be more motivated if Terry Tate threatened to kill me every time I slacked off .
# 8 Huck & Chuck
The Background
Mike Huckabee was an underdog candidate in the 2008 United States presidential election .
Chuck Norris is the world 's deadliest man .
Put them together and you have the most lethal presidential ticket since Bush / Cheney .
I mean , how could this combo create anything but a stirring success ?
The Video
It 's difficult to say exactly what undermines Huckabee 's credibility in this video .
Maybe it 's the fact that he looks a little chubby on camera .
Maybe it's that he enlisted the help of a throwback television action hero to bolster his campaign .
Either way , I think the only way Chuck Norris could have truly made a difference in the election would be if he had strangled Huckabee 's opponents to death with his bare hands .
( Note : Some might not consider Chuck Norris to be a professional athlete , thereby disqualifying him from this list .
I recommend that those people step into Chuck Norris ' personal martial arts dojo and repeat those words to his face . )
# 7 Men's Olympic Basketball Team at a Gas Station
The Background
NBA all - star Chris Bosh is known for his goofy sense of humor .
But what happens when you give a goofy , slightly self - indulgent guy a camera in the days before he competes in the 2008 Olympics ?
The following video showcases Bosh and fellow Olympic teammates Lebron James , Dwight Howard , and Deron Williams hanging out at a gas station and snacking on some Wendy's .
The Video
While the video is n't exactly a model for production quality , it 's definitely cool to see these players outside the context of a basketball game or some highly polished TV spot .
It 's also encouraging to know that you can still be a star player in the NBA and eat horribly unhealthy food like the majority of Americans .
Pay attention all overweight , unsuccessful high school athletes : the problem is you , not your daily Oreo cookie McFlurries .
# 6 Tiger Woods Solves a Rubik's Cube
The Background
Tiger Woods is pretty much universally accepted as the greatest golfer on the face of the planet .
He is known for his tireless work ethic , his ability to win PGA tournaments at will , and of course , his net worth of about a googabillion dollars .
But with all the notches on Tiger 's belt , one has to wonder how he'd stack up against the most rigorous intellectual challenge / childhood activity known to man : the Rubik 's Cube .
The Video
In this video collaboration between Tiger and EA Sports , it 's clear that the Rubik 's Cube is a worthy opponent for the world 's great golfer .
While in reality Tiger probably would have just paid someone to solve the Rubik 's Cube for him so he could get back to
a ) playing golf
b ) making money or
c ) a combination of ' a ' and ' b '
since he 's already on camera he decides to take a more creative approach .
Maybe I 'm naive , but I believe Tiger would n't need more than three takes to shoot this video .
# 5 Kobe Jumps a Car
The Background
Some would say that Los Angeles Lakers all - star Kobe Bryant is the best player in the NBA .
Still others ( probably Lakers fans ) would claim that he 's the best basketball player in the history of the game .
With that kind of hype , a guy would have to pull off some pretty incredible stunts to measure up to his own reputation .
Like jumping over a moving car , for example .
The Video
While skeptics like to dwell on the fact that this video is most likely fake , Kobe 's jump is impressive any way you slice it .
And if you claim that the car is digitally added to the scene , well , that just leaves the door open for tons of possibilities .
How do you know that Kobe did n't actually jump over a cheetah or a helicopter , and they just added the car in later to make it seem more plausible ?
# 4 Bruce Lee Plays Ping - Pong
The Background
Bruce Lee is a martial arts icon , plain and simple .
Even contemporary martial artists like the inimitable Jet Lee and Jean Claude Van Damme could never hold a candle to a Bruce Lee spinning roundhouse .
While the circumstances of Lee 's death are still cloudy with conspiracy theories , one thing is for sure : if and when he is resurrected , he will dominate the global ping - pong circuit .
The Video
While some might take offense to posthumously puppeteering an actor 's corpse to sell products , at least it's in the name of the universally loved sport of ping - pong .
In the video below , Bruce Lee takes the same mind blowing level of skill he applied to martial arts and funnels it into hitting a plastic white ball .
Even Forest Gump would tip his cap to Lee 's posthumous performance .
# 3 Fantasy Football Fever
The Background
Every year , hundreds of thousands of Americans are caught up in fantasy football fever , devising intricate fantasy rosters filled with their favorite NFL players and pitting them against each in other in fierce competition .
The task of devising such a roster is often a tremendous time and emotional investment , and often leads to broken friendships and divorce .
Fortunately , NFL.com has created a series called " NFL Fantasy Files , " which provides some valuable , time - saving insights .
The Video
Not only does this video have that jaw dropping quality we love to see in viral videos , but it features some premier NFL players , like Marc Bulger ( St. Louis Rams ) and Chris Chambers ( San Diego Chargers ) showcasing their comedic chops .
While these players are all insanely gifted athletes , there 's no doubt that their stunts are entirely CGI .
Sure , this series might lead to a few kids trying to catch a football by punching through a sheet of wood , but that 's a small price to pay for this caliber of entertainment .
# 2 Chris Bosh : NBA All - Star
The Background
Playing in the NBA All - Star game is an honor that only a select group of players realize each year .
In 2008 , Chris Bosh put up some solid numbers for the Toronto Raptors , but his competition from other Eastern Conference forwards was fierce , and he was by no means a lock for the All - Star game .
Plus , Toronto is n't exactly known for their enthusiastic basketball community .
The Video
Chris Bosh posted a video on his Youtube channel that promoted his quest to play in 2008 's All - Star game .
In the video , which borderlines on bad and " so bad it 's good , " Bosh plays a used car salesman with a heavy Texas accent .
He urges fans to fill out their ballots and vote him into the All - Star game .
Bosh told the National Post in 2008 : " I want to relate to my fans .
I want them to know that I like to have fun and I 'm not just this crazy guy who plays basketball every night . "
Apparently , Bosh knows what he 's doing .
He was named to 2008 's All - Star game ( as a result of a Kevin Garnet injury ) and was also named an All - Star reserve in 2009 .
# 1 Ronaldinho's New Shoes
The Background
Brazilian soccer player Ronaldinho is like a god in Europe and South America , but we do n't see much of him in the States .
Maybe it 's because hardly anyone in the States watches soccer .
Or maybe it 's because when we do watch soccer , most of us mistake him for Ronaldo .
Either way , this video makes Ronaldinho accessible to soccer and non- soccer fans alike .
The Video
In one of the most watched Youtube videos of all time , Ronaldinho puts on some magic shoes ( low and behold , made my Nike ) , and performs some of the most incredible soccer tricks you 'll ever see .
Sure , a good portion of his tricks are CGI .
And yes , it 's essentially just an elaborate ad for a global corporation .
But at the end of the day , the video is still incredibly addictive , as evidenced by the more than 27 million views on Youtube alone .
Well done , Ronaldo … I mean , Ronaldinho .
In an effort to sooth their anxiety many anxiety sufferers turn to avoidance as a coping tool .
Anxiety sufferers will avoid going to certain places or avoid certain people just to make sure that they wo n’t feel bad .
It ’s almost like we anxiety sufferers would rather hide from the world than deal with the symptoms , thoughts , and feelings that drive us mad .
But avoidance is ultimately not the answer to your troubles .
When you have an anxiety disorder asking questions and searching for information about anxiety becomes almost a ritual .
So here is another good ritual question – does avoidance even work ?
Well overtime I have found that the answer is sometimes .
That ’s because turning down an invitation for a night out or avoiding a visit to a friend ’s home can give us a great sense of relief much of the time .
So much relief in fact that we do n’t or hardly feel nervous after we have confirmed that we can stay home .
We feel better because we feel like we just dodged a bullet .
However in other times nervousness , palpitations , chest pain , achy muscles , etc will come no matter what we do or where we are .
So in that case avoidance can be useless .
I will admit that in terms of being a calming tool avoidance can feel good because it relieves the pressure of potentially having a panic attack or racing thoughts in public .
But as good as this might feel what price do you pay for your peace ?
I have applied the avoidance technique in the past and as a result I have missed out on tons of potentially fun activities .
Here are a few things I have avoided to keep anxiety at bay .
Rejected offers to have friends come over .
Refused to go out to night clubs or bars .
Avoided any type of sit down restaurants .
Stayed home and watched a DVD instead of going out to a movie .
Called in sick to work .
Requested an extended vacation from work even though I had no plans to travel .
Avoided family gatherings .
Reduced travel altogether .
Avoided talking to people while anxious .
Avoided family while at home by staying in a room alone .
We could make this list longer I ’m sure but clearly there are many ways to avoid things and people .
But think about all the wonderful things you cut out of your life to ensure an anxiety free night .
And this avoidance behavior also brings up a real significant question – Can you still do these fun things and not be anxious ?
I would answer that you very well could .
Will you do all these things anxiety free all the time ?
No , but that is o.k. and very achievable .
What is also important to realize is that it ’s not the place (s ) we visit that causes anxiety .
Ask yourself – if finding out that you ’re not going out tonight makes you feel better right away why can you not do the opposite ?
Well the answer is that maybe you just do n’t think it ’s possible .
Maybe you tried and every time you failed and now you do n’t see the point in trying .
But just because it ’s difficult does not make it impossible and just because you have had trouble in the past does not guarantee that this will be a life long trend .
We have to disassociate the places we visit from our own fear .
We have to stop projecting our anxiety on people and locations that have no connection to our anxiety disorder .
The fear and unease we feel while in public is inside of us not outside .
Here is another example – do you have a job ?
If you answered yes than chances are you spend all day around other people .
Work is actually a very social place and it would not be a stretch to think of a restaurant in the same terms .
The terms of course are people doing lots of things all around you and it not bothering you .
It ’s time to fess up and spend some time looking in the mirror if you practice avoidance as a coping mechanism .
You know that this makes you feel left out – you should face this issue squarely .
Do n’t lie to yourself and say something like " I do avoid stuff but not that much " .
If you avoid doing anything it should be because you ’re tired , really not interested or broke but not because you ’re afraid .
Avoidance is a quick fix and you know what has been said about a quick fix – it does not last .
Eventually you have to go out into the world and mingle with the non-anxious .
Avoidance over the long term can lead to not just isolation but also to the development of other anxiety disorders like agoraphobia .
In this way avoidance can add even more stress , fear , and isolation to your life .
If you practice avoidance on a regular basis then stopping this behavior will not happen overnight .
However I recommend that you not avoid fun , happiness , social connections and all the other wonderful things that we feel and think when we are having a good time .
Whether you ’re very young or more mature do n’t stop living your life just to avoid a bad thought or feeling .
Thoughts and feelings can be strong , negative , and terrifying but I can assure you that they alone do n’t kill .
And that ’s the issue right there I think – anxiety sufferers feel like something bad is always around the corner – they always feel like they will drop dead or have a heart attack if they go to the wrong place and become overwhelmed with fear .
This is a common fear but not one that is rooted in fact .
Panic / anxiety attacks do n’t cause heart attacks , they do n’t stop you from breathing and they also do n’t cause insanity .
Anyone from anywhere could die in public if they had a preexisting condition or if something unfortunate were to occur but that has nothing to do with fear or anxiety .
The possibility of " X " is simply life .
The " X " is anything and everything that could possibly ( good or bad ) happen to you on any given day .
There is no controlling life and you must for this reason , I believe strongly , live your life as happy as you can and as carefree as you can .
There is simply no point in waiting for something you can’t confirm , describe or otherwise know anything about – the future is what it is and for now it is unknown .
Do n’t avoid things or people because your life is much too short to avoid .
We simply do n’t have time to hide and not experience the world outside of our homes and away from the things we find comfort in .
If you can find a way to get out of your enclosure on a regular basis this will help you cope with anxiety better than any day or night spent at home .
Getting back out there may take some time but with patience , practice and perseverence you can difintely find something appraoching normal that is not rooted in fear .
Bush should have executed Gitmo detainees , says former CIA officer David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Friday February 27 , 2009

This A former CIA officer has said it 's ridiculous that the Bush administration did n't execute numerous prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , regardless of whether they have had a trial , when it had the chance .
" Many of those individuals that are there are enemy combatants and that 's based on the Geneva Conventions and should be executed , " said Gary Berntsen , who spent 20 years with the CIA , to Fox 's Gretchen Carlson on the show , Fox & Friends .
" It 's ridiculous that the Bush administration , after seven years , did n't deal with many of those that we know are enemy combatants . "
Berntsen , who commanded a team of CIA and special forces in Afghanistan in 2001 , is the author of The Attack on bin Laden and Al - Qaeda : A Personal Account by the CIA 's Key Field Commander .
A Bush supporter , he sued the federal government to win the right to release his book , which detailed his experiences searching for Osama bin Laden in the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan .
In 2008 , Berntsen also actively campaigned for John McCain .
Carlson seemed to agree with Berntsen 's assertion saying of the detainees , " I 'm thinking to myself , they 've been , many of them , there since 2002 .
What was the wait ? "
Berntsen also advocated for the execution of self - described 9/11 mastermind , Khalid Sheikh Muhammad , saying that he no longer serves any intelligence purpose for the U.S .
" After seven years , the intel is dried up .
Execute him , " he said .
In one of his first orders as president , Obama ordered the closure of the detention center in January .
It currently houses approximately 250 terrorism suspects and others in a camp and maximum - security facilities at the Guantanamo U.S. naval base , reports Reuters .
Some inmates have been held there for as long as seven years without charges .
Fox & Friends guest Matthew Alexander , the author of How to Break a Terrorist said he believes the detainees can provide further intelligence to the U.S .
" I think it 's not as important as where as they go as how we continue to get intelligence from them , " Alexander said .
" We can take them to other countries but we should ensure that those countries do not torture them and we have to continue to interrogate them effectively . "

My fury at selfish Britain , by woman forced to give birth on Tube
A young Polish woman who was forced to give birth on the London Underground has revealed how she was sent away from a leading maternity hospital just two hours before her baby was born .
Julita Kowalska , 26 , became the first woman in 84 years recorded as giving birth on the Tube when her daughter Jennifer was born at Kingsbury , North London , on the evening of December 19 last year .
Earlier that night Julita had been taken by ambulance from her home in North London , to St Mary ’s Hospital in Paddington , West London , where Prince William and Prince Harry were delivered .
Turned away : Julita Kowalska , here with new daughter Jennifer , says hospitals in her homeland would have treated her better
But a midwife examined her and sent her away .
Julita claims she was told not to come back ‘ every time you have pain ’ .
Her sister Anna had accompanied Julita to St Mary ’s and , as they began their 35 - minute journey home on the Tube , Julita went into labour .
Now Julita , a cleaner who has two other young children back in Poland , has spoken of her anger at her treatment .
Julita , who was one week overdue when she went to St Mary ’s , said : ‘ I was suffering labour pains every eight to ten minutes .
A midwife saw me but said they were very busy .
She said the baby probably was not going to be born for two days .
‘ So I walked downstairs from the second floor but , by the time I got to the ground floor , the pain was very bad .
The contractions were now coming very often .
So I went back upstairs but a second midwife really seemed to have a dislike for me .
Julita gave birth to her baby daughter on the tube after she was turned away from a London hospital
‘ She grabbed my jacket and pulled me out of the maternity ward .
Outside the door she told me “ You do not need to come back to the hospital every time you have pain ” and
“ Why did you choose this hospital ?
You should have chosen one near where you live . ”
‘ I could not say anything to her .
She just said , “ Go , go , go . ” I was angry .
' I had heard very good things about hospitals here .
The hospitals in Poland are very good .
I ’ve never heard of this happening there . ’
Julita , who has lived in the UK for 18 months , then walked a quarter of a mile with Anna to Paddington station .
She said : ‘ We rushed to the incoming train but I felt there was pressure in my stomach , like the baby was coming . ’
Their journey home involved them catching a Circle Line train to Baker Street , then the Metropolitan Line to Wembley Park and finally the Jubilee Line to Queensbury .
But they never completed it as Julita ’s labour pains became so severe they had to get off one stop early at Kingsbury .
Despite both women becoming hysterical as the labour pains increased , they say no one tried to help them until they climbed off the train at Kingsbury .
Julita said : ‘ There were lots of people going out to parties on the trains and lots of people looked at us .
But no one came to help . ’
At Kingsbury station , the contractions were coming almost every minute .
Only the station staff and one young Hungarian man stopped to help Julita on to a bench on the platform .
A member of staff called 999 just before 9 pm but the ambulance was delayed because , say the sisters , the emergency service operator said he ‘ could not find Kingsbury station on our system ’ .
It arrived 24 minutes later .
Station supervisor Sebastian Rebello said : ‘ Julita was in pain .
She was screaming .
She was in agony as she did not have any painkillers .
I was terrified I would have to deliver the baby . ’
He helped her into his small , threadbare office just off the platform , gave her a blanket and switched on the heating .
It was then Julita ’s waters broke .
At 9.22 pm the ambulance arrived .
Both paramedics were men and one said he had never delivered a baby .
With Julita lying on a blanket on the concrete floor , Jennifer was born at 9.35 pm .
Julita said : ‘ It was very intimidating to have to undress in front of all of these men .
It was very difficult but they were very nice .
‘ I was angry and scared as we had to wait so long for the ambulance . ’
The baby was wrapped in a towel and both mother and Jennifer , who weighed 7lb 8 oz , were taken to nearby Northwick Park Hospital , where they stayed for four days .
A month later , Julita ’s ordeal has still left her shaken .
She said : ‘ The worst part was being thrown out into the cold .
I thought : “ Who is going to help me now ? ” I had heard from so many friends that it is so good to have a baby in England . ’
A spokesman for St Mary ’s Hospital said : ‘ When Ms Kowalska came to us she was given a thorough physical examination which revealed that she was not in labour at the time .
In these circumstances , expectant mothers are discharged with advice on when to return .
‘ It is Trust policy never to turn away a woman who is in established labour .
Ms Kowalska was at no stage turned away due to a lack of beds . ’
The spokesman said they had no record of Julita returning to the ward and being removed from it .
An ambulance spokesman said : ‘ There was a short delay in registering this location on our system but this was resolved within a few minutes of the original call .
‘ As soon as a crew became available , they were sent to the scene . ’
The only other recorded birth on the Tube was in 1924 when a woman called Daisy Hammond gave birth to baby Marie on a Bakerloo Line train at Elephant and Castle station .
I hope the previous post explained virtual memory adequately , but I must admit I held back a much better explanation , which I first saw in Expert C Programming .
It was n't written by the book 's author , Peter van der Linden , but rather by Jeff Berryman in 1972 .
Here goes :
The Thing King and the Paging Game
This note is a formal non-working paper of the Project MAC Computer Systems Research Division .
It should be reproduced and distributed wherever levity is lacking , and may be referenced at your own risk in other publications .
Rules
Each player gets several million things .
Things are kept in crates that hold 4096 things each .
Things in the same crate are called crate - mates .
Crates are stored either in the workshop or the warehouses .
The workshop is almost always too small to hold all the crates .
There is only one workshop but there may be several warehouses .
Everybody shares them .
Each thing has its own thing number .
What you do with a thing is to zark it .
Everybody takes turns zarking .
You can only zark your things , not anybody else's .
Things can only be zarked when they are in the workshop .
Only the Thing King knows whether a thing is in the workshop or in a warehouse .
The longer a thing goes without being zarked , the grubbier it is said to become .
The way you get things is to ask the Thing King .
He only gives out things by the crateful .
This is to keep the royal overhead down .
The way you zark a thing is to give its thing number .
If you give the number of a thing that happens to be in a workshop it gets zarked right away .
If it is in a warehouse , the Thing King packs the crate containing your thing back into the workshop .
If there is no room in the workshop , he first finds the grubbiest crate in the workshop , whether it be yours or somebody else 's , and packs it off with all its crate - mates to a warehouse .
In its place he puts the crate containing your thing .
Your thing then gets zarked and you never know that it was n't in the workshop all along .
Each player 's stock of things have the same numbers as everybody else 's .
The Thing King always knows who owns what thing and whose turn it is , so you can't ever accidentally zark somebody else 's thing even if it has the same thing number as one of yours .
Notes
Traditionally , the Thing King sits at a large , segmented table and is attended to by pages ( the so - called " table pages " ) whose job it is to help the king remember where all the things are and who they belong to .
One consequence of Rule 13 is that everybody 's thing numbers will be similar from game to game , regardless of the number of players .
The Thing King has a few things of his own , some of which move back and forth between workshop and warehouse just like anybody else 's , but some of which are just too heavy to move out of the workshop .
With the given set of rules , oft - zarked things tend to get kept mostly in the workshop while little - zarked things stay mostly in a warehouse .
This is efficient stock control .
Long Live the Thing King !
Update : Alex pointed out the difficulties of measuring grubbiness in a comment below .

Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as a byproduct of metabolism .
These ROS are implicated in the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging ( MFRTA ) as the major cause of aging phenotypes .
If the MFRTA is true , one could delay aging by removing these mitochondrially - produced ROS with enzymes or antioxidants .
Although many antioxidant therapies for cancer and other age - related diseases have proved fruitless , these studies did not specifically target antioxidants to the mitochondria .
One group recently did just that in mice with catalase , an antioxidant enzyme normally found in peroxisomes .
By translocating catalase to the mitochondria , the scientists expanded the lifespan of the animals by five months .
Such genetic manipulations such as these are not in the cards when it comes to preventing human aging .
Therefore , other mitochondrial targeting strategies must be employed .
Accordingly , Vladamir Skulachev ’s group synthesized an antioxidant attached to a positively charged ion , which they call SkQ1 .
This compound can readily pass through the cell membrane and travel to the mitochondrial intermembrane space , the only negatively charged region in the cell .
There , SkQ1 will soak up any ROS formed by the electron transport chain .
SkQ1 works similarly to the popular MitoQ , but does not have the pro-oxidant properties MitoQ is known to have at higher concentrations .
SkQ1 is also better than MitoQ at inhibiting apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide .
Studies by the group also showed that SkQ1 proved beneficial for heart and cardiovascular disease , tumor growth , and cataracts .
Anisimov et al found that SkQ1 increases the lifespan of several species of animals .
The median and maximum lifespan of the fungus P. anserina was significantly increased with treatment of SkQ1 .
In the crustacean C. affins , the mean lifespan of SkQ1 - treated animals was doubled compared to controls .
In Drosophila , SkQ1 treatment significantly increased median lifespan in both males and females .
Additionally , the researchers investigated the timing of SkQ1 treatment using Drosophila .
Flies treated with SkQ1 during only their first week of life had the same survival curve as flies treated throughout their lives .
There was no effect on survival in flies treated with SkQ1 for one week starting at 30 days of age , but , for flies treated constantly from 30 days of age , there was a reversion to the lifespan curve of flies treated constantly from day one .
These results are reminiscent of Michael Rose ’s experiments on the timing of calorie restriction in Drosophila .
In mice , the optimal dose of SkQ1 increased median lifespan by about 90 % , with a maximum lifespan for both control and treated mice between 800 - 850 days .
It would be interesting to see if the mouse strain they used or husbandry conditions had any effect on the results , as a 800 days is an entire year shorter than the reported maximum lifespan for mice .
SkQ1 treatment had its largest effect on preventing death from non-cancerous diseases , with SkQ1 - treated mice actually having a higher incidence of a certain kind of cancer , mammary gland adenocarcinoma .
This might have to do with the fact that SkQ1 prevents the disappearance of estrus in female mice .
Finally , fibroblasts treated with SkQ1 were more resistant than controls to hydrogen peroxide treatment , and expressed almost no β- galactosidase activity , a marker of senescence .
Notably , SkQ1 treatment is the only anti-aging treatment other than calorie restriction that has been shown to be effective across such a wide range of species .
These results suggest that SkQ1 or other methods of chemical targeting of antioxidants to mitochondria hold promise as a novel means of intervening in the aging process .
( For more on SkQ1 , see the coverage at Longevity Meme . )
POPE Benedict XVI has told Gordon Brown that he has believed some crazy things in his time but he 's not buying that crap .
During an audience in Rome yesterday Mr Brown said Britain was facing a deep recession and its people were suffering , but insisted none of it had anything to do with him .
Pope Benedict told the prime minister : " Are you taking the piss ?
Eh ?
This is the Vatican , you can't just come in here and start taking the piss , you know .
" Listen chum , I believe that a 14 year - old girl got pregnant by the ' Holy Spirit ' and that the child was the Son of God and also God at the same time , whatever that means .
" I believe that he walked on water , that he raised the dead and that he fed 5000 people with a couple of haddock .
" I believe that he was killed and then came back to life all in the same weekend and I believe that these tiny little wafers are his actual body and this rather cheap , nasty red wine is his actual blood .

Zenit St Petersburg have confirmed talks are taking place with Arsenal regarding a deal for Andrei Arshavin .
Zenit confident playmaker will move to Emirates Stadium
Top player
Zenit St Petersburg have toldthat talks are taking place with Arsenal regarding a deal for Andrei Arshavin .
Maxim Mitrofanov , the club 's general director , has toldchief news reporter Bryan Swanson that he hopes a deal can be done within the next two weeks .
Russian schemer Arshavin has been looking to leave the Uefa Cup holders in search of a move to a major European league .
He impressed at Euro 2008 and was linked with Arsenal 's North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur , along with Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid after the tournament .
However , in recent weeks , speculation concerning a possible January move to Arsenal has increased after he was given permission to discuss his departure from Zenit .
Reports suggest Zenit are demanding a £ 20 million fee for Arshavin , but the Gunners value the 27 - year - old at considerably less .
Zenit , though , have toldthat they are confident of agreeing a deal to sell the playmaker to Arsenal this month .
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has been looking to reinforce his squad after losing captain Cesc Fabregas for several months due to a knee injury .
Wenger has previously been coy on any interest in Arshavin , but admitted over the weekend that he was aiming to sign a player of ' special class ' .
He also confirmed that availability for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League would not be an issue , with Arshavin unable to feature against Roma after appearing in the group stage for Zenit .
Meanwhile , Zenit coach Dick Advocaat is resigned to losing Arshavin during the January transfer window .
Advocaat said : " I am aware that Arsenal are interested , but I do n't know any more than that .
However , I am expecting Arshavin to leave Zenit for another club .
" He is a top player and he could play for any team and any of the top teams in England , Arsenal , Manchester United , Chelsea or Liverpool .
" He was voted player of the year by the sports writers last season - and we know that they know everything !
" Arshavin played well for us last season , but he did n't play as well as he can .
There is still more to come from him and people will see that .
" In principle , I have already bought Arshavin 's successor , Danny , because I thought Arshavin was going to leave last year so did Zenit .
Danny can play in the same position as Arshavin so we wo n't be disrupted when he goes . "
Over the past several years , Wikileaks has made a name for itself by poking its electronic fingers in the eyes of the powers that be while shining a light on the confidential documents of said powers .
Now , it appears that the spotlight has been turned inward .
Due to a bit of careless e-mail etiquette , a list of past Wikileaks donors has fallen into the hands of an individual that , in turn , posted the list to Wikileaks .
True to its principles , the organization has placed the list online .
It 's hard to have followed the news of the past several years and not heard of Wikileaks — even if your taste in news stories does n't tend towards confidential government documents — as the organization has found itself at the center of legal cases that raised questions about the basics of sharing information on the Internet .
After confidential bank documents appeared on the site , a judge ordered its DNS record erased , which attracted the attention of some major civil liberties groups .
Meanwhile , other documents hosted there have drawn the ire of the Mormons and Scientologists , who object to having their practices revealed to the public .
But governments remain a prime target of the group , which has hosted information ranging from the trivial ( the Sarah Palin e-mail hack ) to the sensitive ( reports from the Congressional Research Service ) to the positively dangerous ( the specs for a military jamming device ) .
That last case raised questions about exactly what editorial control takes place at Wikileaks , given that it must have some criteria for deciding which documents are genuine and relevant ( especially since they seem to have fans among the conspiracy theorists — more on that below ) .
The issue of editorial control was obviously raised again when its fundraising appeal boomeranged back to it as a potential leak .
Apparently , whoever sent the appeal via e-mail had a moment of carelessness , and placed a collection of 58 potential donors ' addresses in the " CC : " field instead of " BCC : . "
That meant that anyone who received this particular missive was able to see who their fellows were ; thanks to Wikileaks policy , everyone else can now see , as well .
For the most part , the list is n't especially informative .
Someone who happens to e-mail " christhesoundguy " or " perilandmishap " on a regular basis might know who they were , but that 's probably a small minority .
In those cases where full names could be extracted from the list , they were fairly generic , and searching led to disambiguators at places like Facebook and Linked In .
Some of the rest are n't particularly interesting — do I really care that a couple of German database programmers think Wikileaks is a good idea ?
Perhaps the most interesting finds are that Wikileaks has fans among the conspiracy theory community , which presumably hopes that that the documents will ultimately uncover evidence of their personal mania ( in one case , an inexhaustible energy source that has been suppressed by the oil companies ) .
Given that these communities tend to see evidence of their pet theories pretty much everywhere , it reinforces the impression that the Wikileaks staff has to exercise some discretion when posting material .
It 's possible that this use of staff resources may represent the biggest drain on Wikileaks ' finances , as the group has saved on legal fees by steadfastly refusing to respond to any legal actions directed against it .
The memo is probably less interesting for its list of donors than for noting that the organization is currently running off the savings of some of its members .
Apparently , its attempts to auction off a piece of Hugo Chavez has n't brought it the sort of stability it might have hoped for .

The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral .
— Dante Alighieri , famous hell expert John F. Kennedy , misquoter
Belief is quantitative , and just as it is possible to make overconfident assertions relative to ones anticipations , it is possible to make under confident assertions relative to ones anticipations .
One can wear the attire of uncertainty , or profess an agnosticism that is n’t really there .
Here ,
Ill single out a special case of improper uncertainty : the display of neutrality or suspended judgment in order to signal maturity , impartiality , or a superior vantage point .
An example would be the case of my parents , who respond to theological questions like “ Why does ancient Egypt , which had good records on many other matters , lack any records of Jews having ever been there ? ” with “ Oh , when I was your age , I also used to ask that sort of question , but now I ’ve grown out of it . ”
Another example would be the principal who , faced with two children who were caught fighting on the playground , sternly says : “ It does n’t matter who started the fight , it only matters who ends it . ”
Of course it matters who started the fight .
The principal may not have access to good information about this critical fact , but if so , the principal should say so , not dismiss the importance of who threw the first punch .
Let a parent try punching the principal , and we ’ll see how far “ It does n’t matter who started it ” gets in front of a judge .
But to adults it is just inconvenient that children fight , and it matters not at all to their convenience which child started it .
It is only convenient that the fight end as rapidly as possible .
A similar dynamic , I believe , governs the occasions in international diplomacy where Great Powers sternly tell smaller groups to stop that fighting right now .
It does n’t matter to the Great Power who started it — who provoked , or who responded disproportionately to provocation — because the Great Power ’s ongoing inconvenience is only a function of the ongoing conflict .
Oh , ca n’t Israel and Hamas just get along ?
This I call “ pretending to be Wise . ”
Of course there are many ways to try and signal wisdom .
But trying to signal wisdom by refusing to make guesses — refusing to sum up evidence — refusing to pass judgment — refusing to take sides — staying above the fray and looking down with a lofty and condescending gaze — which is to say , signaling wisdom by saying and doing nothing — well , that I find particularly pretentious .
Paolo Freire said , “ Washing one ’s hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless means to side with the powerful , not to be neutral . ” 1
A playground is a great place to be a bully , and a terrible place to be a victim , if the teachers do n’t care who started it .
And likewise in international politics :
A world where the Great Powers refuse to take sides and only demand immediate truces is a great world for aggressors and a terrible place for the aggressed .
But , of course , it is a very convenient world in which to be a Great Power or a school principal .
So part of this behavior can be chalked up to sheer selfishness on the part of the Wise .
But part of it also has to do with signaling a superior vantage point .
After all — what would the other adults think of a principal who actually seemed to be taking sides in a fight between mere children ?
Why , it would lower the principal ’s status to a mere participant in the fray !
Similarly with the revered elder — who might be a CEO , a prestigious academic , or a founder of a mailing list — whose reputation for fairness depends on their refusal to pass judgment themselves , when others are choosing sides .
Sides appeal to them for support , but almost always in vain ; for the Wise are revered judges on the condition that they almost never actually judge — then they would just be another disputant in the fray , no better than any mere arguer .
2
There are cases where it is rational to suspend judgment , where people leap to judgment only because of their biases .
As Michael Rooney said :
The error here is similar to one I see all the time in beginning philosophy students : when confronted with reasons to be skeptics , they instead become relativists .
That is , when the rational conclusion is to suspend judgment about an issue , all too many people instead conclude that any judgment is as plausible as any other .
But then how can we avoid the ( related but distinct ) pseudo - rationalist behavior of signaling your unbiased impartiality by falsely claiming that the current balance of evidence is neutral ?
“ Oh , well , of course you have a lot of passionate Darwinists out there , but I think the evidence we have does n’t really enable us to make a definite endorsement of natural selection over intelligent design . ”
On this point I ’d advise remembering that neutrality is a definite judgment .
It is not staying above anything .
It is putting forth the definite and particular position that the balance of evidence in a particular case licenses only one summation , which happens to be neutral .
This belief , too , must pay rent in anticipated experiences , and it can be wrong ; propounding neutrality is just as attackable as propounding any particular side .
Likewise with policy questions .
If someone says that both pro-life and pro-choice sides have good points and that they really should try to compromise and respect each other more , they are not taking a position above the two standard sides in the abortion debate .
They are putting forth a definite judgment , every bit as particular as saying “ pro-life ! ” or “ pro-choice ! ”
It may be useful to initially avoid using issues like abortion or the Israeli - Palestinian conflict for your rationality practice , and so build up skill on less emotionally charged topics .
But it ’s not that a rationalist is too mature to talk about politics .
It ’s not that a rationalist is above this foolish fray in which only mere political partisans and youthful enthusiasts would stoop to participate .
As Robin Hanson describes it , the ability to have potentially divisive conversations is a limited resource .
If you can think of ways to pull the rope sideways , you are justified in expending your limited resources on relatively less common issues where marginal discussion offers relatively higher marginal payoffs .
3
But then the responsibilities that you deprioritize are a matter of your limited resources .
Not a matter of floating high above , serene and Wise .
In sum , there ’s a difference between :
50 - ton statue in Kobe is delayed while funds are collected via Tetsujin Curry
Not -So -Daily Links of the Day : The Asahi Shimbun paper reports that the city of Kobe is still planning to erect a 15 - meter ( 49 - foot ) statue of the Tetsujin 28 - gō ( Ironman # 28 or Gigantor ) robot , although the unveiling has been pushed back from last spring to this summer since the project still needs more funds .
The Kobe Tetsujin Project 's statue is intended as a symbol of the city 's revival after the 1995 Kobe Earthquake .
It is being build in Nagata Ward , the city 's hardest hit neighborhood that has since been rebuilt and revitalized .
The statue also celebrates the life of one of Kobe 's most well - known native sons : Mitsuteru Yokoyama , the creator of Tetsujin 28 , Giant Robo , and Sally the Witch .
The project has not collected all of the 135 million yen ( about US $ 1.47 million ) it needs , although the city has pitched in 45 million yen ( US $ 489,000 ) .
The sales of " Tetsujin Curry " have also brought in more money to the coffers .
Under the revised plans , the statue will weigh 50 tons .
Mamoru Oshii ( Ghost in the Shell , Mobile Police Patlabor , Avalon ) wrote and directed a stage play adaptation of the manga with a six - meter - tall ( 20 - foot - tall ) robot replica this year , while Hong Kong 's IMAGI studio ( TMNT , Astro Boy ) began streaming a computer - animated teaser video last month .

Several centuries ago , the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy .
There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community , so the Pope offered a deal .
He 'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community .
If the Jews won , they could stay in Italy ; if the Pope won , they 'd have to convert or leave .
The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate .
However , as the rabbi spoke no Italian , and the Pope spoke no Yiddish , they agreed that it would be a ' silent ' debate .
On the chosen day the Pope and rabbi sat opposite each other .
The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers .
The rabbi looked back and raised one finger .
Next , the Pope waved his finger around his head .
The rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat .
The Pope brought out communion bread and a chalice of wine .
The rabbi pulled out an apple .
With that , the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever .
The Jews could stay in Italy .
Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened .
The Pope said , “ First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity .
He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs .
Then , I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us .
He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us .
I pulled out the bread and wine to show that God absolves us of all our sins .
He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin .
He bested me at every move and I could not continue . ”
Meanwhile , the Jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he'd won .
“ I have n't a clue . ” the rabbi said .
“ First , he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy , so I gave him the finger .
Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews and I told him that we were staying right here . ”
“ And then what ? ” asked a woman .
In a distant galaxy the civilization known as the Yars were attacked by the fierce Qotiles .
Though badly damaged , the Yars ' fought back using their mechanical ships that look like giant metal insects .
The Qotiles have many laser cannons shielded behind celluliod barriers which are capable of destroying the Yars .
It 's up to you to control your Yar ships and dig your way through the shields and fire your powerful Zorlon Cannon into the Qotiles .
The enemy is relentless ; there are thousands of laser cannons surrounding the people of Yar , each one is capable of firing deadly energy swirls at the Yars .
They are also protected with a destroyer missile that will constantly track you down and detonate your Yar ship .
It 's up to you to save the Yars , good luck !
Yars ' Revenge was the most popular original - concept Atari game ever .
It was released for the Atari 2600 in 1981 , and programmed by Howard Scott Warshaw ( The same man who wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark , and E.T. ) .
It 's a fast pace action game that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time you 're playing it .
And it is certainly one of my favorite Atari games .
In Yars ' Revenge you are the piolet of a Yar ship .
The Yar system was attacked by the Qotiles and you are trying to stop them .
The joystick controls your movement and the fire button shoots your cannon .
The Qotile 's Laser Cannon is shielded behind a large group of red cells .
Every other Qotile has a moving shield which makes it even more difficult to hit them .
If you fire your small missiles into the cells it will destroy a small chunk of them .
You can also fly up to the shield and bite off a cell .
When you eat a cell you get energy to fire your Zorlon Cannon .
The Zorlon Cannon is the only weapon in your aresenal capable of destroying the Qotile .
The problem is that the Zorlon Cannon is so dangerous that it can also destroy you .
You can also use the Zorlon Cannon to hits the shield but it will only destroy one cell .
The Qotiles have more defenses then just their shields .
They also have a destroyer missile guarding every Qotile Laser Cannon .
The missile relentlessly hunts you down and if it touches you your Yar ship will be destroyed .
As if that were not enough the Qotile 's Laser Cannon has the ability to turn into a swirl of destructive energy and shoot out at you killing you if you are hit .
Luckily , there are a few things that will help you on your way .
In the middle of the screen is a flickering and glittering field .
This is the neutral zone .
As long as you remain in it you are safe from the destroyer missile .
However , you will be unable to shoot your weapon as well .
This is n't a true safe heaven though , as the Qotile 's swirls can still kill you , regardless of whether you 're in the neutral zone .
Keep an eye on the Qotile 's Laser Cannon .
It pulsates different colors , when it turns red it will turn into an energy swirl .
If timed right you 'll never be surprised by the Qotiles .
As you progress in the game , the Qotiles get smarter and faster .
Check the table below to see what happens .
Score Shield Laser Cannon 70,000 Blue Swirls triple in frequency .
( Red , Blue , Green ) Sometimes fire instantly .
150,000 Gray Swirls back to normal frequency , but they now change direction in mid-flight .
230,000 Pink
Three swirls again , with mid-flight direction changes , and they sometimes fire instantly .
For added difficulty , the neutral zone has a tendancy to disappear after awhile into the game .
It comes back eventually though .
It 's better to never use your cannon until the later stages because you do n't get as many points as when you bite the shield .
Also , it 's to your benefit to try and kill the Qotile when it's in swirl form in the air because you get a bonus
Yar ship ( easier said than done ) .
Also , if you want to live longer stay near the edges of the screen ( top and bottom ) to better avoid the Qotile .
This is a tactic you 'll learn quickly when the Qotile starts changing direction in mid-air .
Action Points
Cell hit by missile 69 Cell devoured by Yar 69 + 100 bonus points Qotile Destroyed 1000 Swirl destroyed in place 2000 Swirl destroyed in air 6000 + bonus ship
Winning
Winning ?
Oh , please !
You want everything !
There is no real way to beat Yars ' Revenge ( as with many older games ) .
However , for a good stopping point , if you can reach 999,999 points consider yourself an expert ( yes , it is possible ) .
My personal highest score ever for this game is : 245,863 .

A few years ago Porsche decided to stop production of their popular Porsche Carrera GT but the car still gets a lot of interest nowadays .
A lot of car tuners came out with different versions of Porsche ’s supercar and the one made by Gemballa called “ Mirage GT ” is one of the most popular tuning packages for the GT because it has an aggressive body kit and a lot of color combinations and soft finishes .
The tuner made a new version called “ Mirage GT Carbon Edition ” and even though they do n’t offer too many details , the package seems pretty great .
It has a lot of carbon fiber elements and a two tone Pearl Wite and Black paint .
Gemballa announced some performance specifications for their latest project and the Mirage GT Carbon Edition is equipped with a 670 HP engine and could accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 3.7 seconds .
The car will reach 200 km/h in 9.7 seconds and it has a top speed of over 335 km /h .
The tuner might come with this new modified car at the upcoming Geneva Motor
Show that starts in less than one week and there we could get additional info about this ride .

Beyond that , proponents of Keynesian - style stimulus spending in the United States say that Japan ’s approach failed to accomplish more not because of waste but because it was never tried wholeheartedly .
They argue that instead of making one big push to pump up the economy with economic shock therapy , Japan spread its spending out over several years , diluting the effects .
After years of heavy spending in the first half of the 1990s , economists say , Japan ’s leaders grew concerned about growing budget deficits and cut back too soon , snuffing out the recovery in its infancy , much as Roosevelt did to the American economy in 1936 .
Growth that , by 1996 , had reached 3 percent was suffocated by premature spending cuts and tax increases , they say .
While spending remained high in the late 1990s , Japan never gave the economy another full - fledged push , these economists say .
They also say that the size of Japan ’s apparently successful stimulus in the early 1990s suggests that the United States will need to spend far more than the current $ 820 billion to get results .
Between 1991 and 1995 , Japan spent some $ 2.1 trillion on public works , in an economy roughly half as large as that of the United States , according to the Cabinet Office .
“ Stimulus worked in Japan when it was tried , ” said David Weinstein , a professor of Japanese economics at Columbia University .
“ Japan ’s lesson is that , if anything , the current U.S. stimulus will not be enough . ”

Most Japanese economists have tended to take a bleaker view of their nation ’s track record , saying that Japan spent more than enough money , but wasted too much of it on roads to nowhere and other unneeded projects .
Dr. Ihori of the University of Tokyo did a survey of public works in the 1990s , concluding that the spending created almost no additional economic growth .
Instead of spreading beneficial ripple effects across the economy , he found that the spending actually led to declines in business investment by driving out private investors .
He also said job creation was too narrowly focused in the construction industry in rural areas to give much benefit to the overall economy .
He agreed with other critics that the 1990s stimulus failed because too much of it went to roads and bridges , overbuilding this already heavily developed nation .
Critics also said decisions on how to spend the money were made behind closed doors by bureaucrats , politicians and the construction industry , and often reflected political considerations more than economic .
Dr. Ihori said the United States appeared to be striking a better balance by investing in new energy and information - technology infrastructure as well as replacing aging infrastructure .

6 Your Caffeine Addiction
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
" Addiction " might be a tad dramatic seeing as how there is n't actually any hard evidence that caffeine is addictive , but we 're willing to stake our reputation as Internet doctors that pretty much everybody reading this has had a liquid stimulant today .
There are casual and hard - core caffeine users , but both can find themselves getting fatter by the day .
The casual drinkers disguise their stimulant in layers of crushed ice and whipped cream .
This gets to be a problem when drinks like Starbucks ' famous Frappuccino have around 500 calories per cup .
Even worse , the human brain has a logical disconnect when it comes to liquid calories .
That is to say , it does n't acknowledge them at all .

So for instance , a personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut has 610 calories .
Therefore , your Starbucks beverage is like a little pizza transformed into a little fruity coffee with training - wheels .
The difference is that the pizza will make you feel full .
The Frappuccino wo n't .
You , as an unsatisfied , horse - faced Frappuccino - drinker .
Then you 've got the hardcore caffeine users , who prefer high - energy beverages with names like Rockstar and Monster and Red Bull and many other things the drinker will never actually resemble .
They may also drink black coffee or espresso .
The hardcore drinker just wants the quick energy rush .

Now , while those drinks do n't have the pizza - scale calories of the Starbucks drink up there , it does n't matter because Caffeine has so many inventive methods of fattening you up that we could 've named this article " 6 Ways Caffeine Is Making Your Ass Resemble A Pile Of Damp Towels . "
The biggest thing caffeine does is jack your stress level through the roof , which steers your metabolism straight into " Survival / Conservation " mode .
While it 's doing that , it also increases your appetite , which makes you seek a whole pile of comfort foods to swallow in order to cope with that stress we just mentioned .
And while it 's doing that , caffeine will also be running around your body fucking with your hormones and raising your cholesterol and basically just being a complete dick .

What we 're trying to say is that the only reason a can of Red Bull has n't gained sentience and murdered your entire family is because doing that probably would n't make you any fatter .
Roberto Alomar Sued By Ilya Dall For AIDS Phobia ( Photos , Video )
Former major league second baseman , is being sued by his ex-girlfriend Ilya Dall in Brooklyn Federal Court for AIDS phobia .
She acknowledges that she engaged in unprotected sex for three years with the 12 - time All Star ballplayer until he received an HIV - positive diagnosis in early 2006 .
She claims he told her he was disease free though she now believes he knew he was not .
According to State and Federal court papers , Alomar , 41 , retired from a highly successful baseball career in 2005 because of ill health and was diagnosed with full blown AIDS in January 2006 .
The couple 's relationship began in late 2002 and ended in October 2008 .
Dall does not claim to be HIV - positive but lives in fear that the condition will manifest itself sometime in the future .
The suit claims that nine days after receiving the HIV - positive finding , Alomar went to a disease specialist who discovered a mass .
The ballplayer 's skin was purple , he was foaming at the mouth and a spinal tape " showed that he had full blown AIDS . "
Alomar 's lawyer , Charles Bach , is calling the lawsuit frivolous and the allegations baseless .
He says his client is " healthy and would like to keep his health status private .
We 'll do our talking in court . "
Dall 's lawyer , Anthony J. Piacentini , filed the $ 15 million lawsuit in State court in Queens last month but has now submitted additional paperwork to have the case moved to Brooklyn Federal court .
Dall is alleging that Alomar exhibited many of the symptoms of AIDS as early as 2004 and ignored the advice of medical professions who suggested that he be tested for the condition .
Alomar played for seven teams , including the Mets , Baltimore , Tornonto and Cleveland during his 17 year career .
Check out a video from the Toronto Blue Jays home opener in 2008 .
Alomar 's name was added to the ' Level of Excellence ' during a pre-game ceremony .
Also , check out the screen shot from Alomar 's website under the current news tab .

When Illinois chefs Tom and Athena Seefurth handed out samples of their homemade beer at a local liquor store , they surprised more than a few customers ; instead of the usual aroma of roasted malt or bitter hops , unsuspecting imbibers were treated to a waft of garlic … oregano … basil …and tomatoes ?
The inventors of “ pizza beer ” and owners of two - year - old Mamma Mia !
Pizza Beer Company did not set out to create such a quirky liquor .
According to the Seefurths , the seeds of genius sprouted in their garage in Rivertown , IL , 50 miles west of Chicago , amid boxes of old concert T - shirts , giant stockpots , and vintage beer can collections .
The two were brewing up bad jokes and batches of homemade beer when — Eureka !— inspiration struck : “ We wanted to make a beer that would pair with our favorite food , so we thought : Pizza beer , why not ? ”
Though it may seem that such isolated discoveries are fated , concocting strange liquors is n’t limited to happy accidents or individual genius , or even to midwestern suburbs .
From the arid plains of Mexico to the hill towns of Italy , strange liquors have been a worldwide tradition since the hazy and fortuitous beginnings of alcohol millennia ago .
In ancient times , liquor was part medicine , part religion .
The Chinese have long prescribed “ lizard wine ” as a remedy for arthritis and ulcers , while the Incans poured the saliva - fermented chicha ( corn beer ) on the ground during ritual harvest ceremonies .
Though many of these intoxicating formulas have shed their original purposes , the recipes have outlasted the ages , and people are still enjoying these unusual drinks today .
Knocking back these odd liquors has become a way for locals to stay rooted to their traditions , and for foreigners , they can provide a window into the culture itself .
Take kvas , the ubiquitous liquor from Russia made from fermented cubes of stale black or rye bread .
Come summertime , locals flock to vendors who roam neighborhoods with giant yellow jugs dispensing flavored ( berries , mint , raisins ) versions of the stuff — just as they have for centuries .
The traditional drink , which dates back to antiquity and early czarist reigns , was consumed by both peasants and nobles alike .
But today , with hundreds of bottles lining the shelves , liquors no longer sell themselves .
That ’s why some makers have severed ties with convention and turned to innovation , reaching deep into their imaginations to pull out novelties with shock value to stand up to otherwise ordinary products .
Perhaps the most notorious liquor marketing scheme of all : the “ worm ” in mezcal .
Before the addition of the wriggly invertebrate ( actually , it ’s larva ) , mezcal was merely tequila ’s less glamorous cousin .
Thanks to an ingenious marketing campaign in the 1940s , the Mexican agave liquor now enjoys a mysterious reputation as an ( alleged ) aphrodisiac with hallucinations in store for those who dare eat the worm .
Whether traditional brew or modern marketing ploy , today ’s strange liquors are all but made for a curious and adventurous international crowd of imbibers .

Editor : ' Bush loyalists ' may undermine , then ' sabotage ' Obama David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday February 3 , 2009

When the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that President Obama had preserved the use of renditions -- the secret capture , transportation and detention of suspected terrorists to foreign prisons in countries that cooperate with the U.S. -- for the CIA 's anti-terror toolbox , many liberals were outraged .
Some charged that the paper was " punked " by former CIA officials , or that the writer just plain got things wrong .
On Monday night , MSNBC 's Rachael Maddow wondered aloud if " Bush loyalists " who remain in government are trying to " undermine " President Obama .
Maddow 's guest , a contributing editor with Harper 's magazine , agreed with her line of questioning , and even went so far as to say , " I think we may see sabotage as well . "
While initially Maddow doubted the fidelity of Obama 's Jan. 22 executive order mandating the end of President Bush 's torture policies , the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison and the shuttering of the CIA 's so - called " black sites , " she said that Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU 's National Security Project , set her straight .
" Mr. Jaffer , who knows about these things , was not freaking out at all , " said Maddow .
" Today is a great day for civil liberties , " Jaffer said after the president signed his first round of executive orders .
" In many way , these executive orders are exactly what we 've been waiting for .
I think it 's important to take a moment just to recognize how far these policies are from where we were just a couple of days ago . "
And then , the Times story touched ground .
" But these experts , these civil liberties guys , keep telling me that it's not like that , " said Maddow .
" So , what 's with the leaking to the press from ' current and former intelligence officials ' trying to make it seem like Obama is keeping Bush 's policies , when I do n't actually think that he is ?
" I need a talking down here .
Is Obama being undermined by Bush loyalists , or others who want to make it seem like Bush 's worst policies were n't really so bad , that they are being kept by the popular new guy ? "
Joining Maddow to discuss the issue was Scott Horton , a contributing editor with Harper 's magazine .
After the Times report on continued renditions , Horton went on a tear , saying the paper " just got punked " in a story titled , " Renditions Buffoonery . "
" The earlier renditions program regularly involved snatching and removing targets for purposes of bringing them to justice by delivering them to a criminal justice system , " he wrote .
" It did not involve the operation of long - term detention facilities and it did not involve torture .
There are legal and policy issues with the renditions program , but they are not in the same league as those surrounding extraordinary rendition .
Moreover , Obama committed to shut down the extraordinary renditions program , and continuously made clear that this did not apply to the renditions program .
" In the course of the last week weve seen a steady stream of efforts designed to show that Obama is continuing the counterterrorism programs that he previously labeled as abusive and promised to shut down .
These stories are regularly sourced to unnamed current or former CIA officials and have largely run in right - wing media outlets .
However , now we see that even the Los Angeles Times can be taken for a ride . "
On Maddow 's show , Horton said , " Even human rights advocates feel that there is a role for renditions still , " though he was careful to draw a distinction between Bush 's " extraordinary renditions " and what Obama , and presidents dating back to Reagan , have allowed to carry on .
" In the lame - duck period , we heard a lot about Bush staffers burrowing into jobs throughout the federal government , " said Maddow .
" Do you think that means , just tactically , that we should expect long term Bush legacy polishing stuff like this from anonymous sources inside the government ? "
" Exactly right , " said Horton .
" I think we may see sabotage as well .
Certainly there are going to be efforts to portray what Obama is doing as continuity rather than change , to try and undermine Obama 's message . "

Plaudits to the parents of a Welsh teenager for protesting at her school 's decision to install CCTV cameras in the toilets and connect them to a monitor in the staff room .
Anthony and Tracy White from Llandysul , Ceredigion , described the cameras as an " outrageous invasion " of their daughter Jade 's privacy , and have withdrawn her from school .
Mr White said : " The school is being pathetic .
They do n't need security cameras in toilets – certainly not in schools .
" The whole place is like they 're on Big Brother .
There are cameras all around the school , outside and in the corridors . "
The head of Ysgol Dyffryn Teifi , Aeron Rhys , said the cameras were installed after pupils " expressed concern that the wash basin areas were not being respected by a small minority " of children .
Rhys claimed the cameras would target pupils involved in " horseplay " who misused paper towels and liquid soap .
Can cameras in school toilets ever be justified – for example , to prevent bullying or violence ?
Or do they risk striking the wrong balance students ' safety and their privacy ?
Whistleblower : NSA spied on everyone , targeted journalists David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday January 21 , 2009
Print This Email This Updates : Sen . Rockefeller believes NSA may have spied on him ; Ex-NSA analyst believes program a remnant of ' Total Information Awareness '
Former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice , who helped expose the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping in December 2005 , has now come forward with even more startling allegations .
Tice told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann on Wednesday that the programs that spied on Americans were not only much broader than previously acknowledged but specifically targeted journalists .
" The National Security Agency had access to all Americans ' communications -- faxes , phone calls , and their computer communications , " Tice claimed .
" It did n't matter whether you were in Kansas , in the middle of the country , and you never made foreign communications at all .
They monitored all communications . "
Tice further explained that " even for the NSA it 's impossible to literally collect all communications .
...
What was done was sort of an ability to look at the metadata ... and ferret that information to determine what communications would ultimately be collected . "
According to Tice , in addition to this " low - tech , dragnet " approach , the NSA also had the ability to hone in on specific groups , and that was the aspect he himself was involved with .
However , even within the NSA there was a cover story meant to prevent people like Tice from realizing what they were doing .
" In one of the operations that I was in , we looked at organizations , just supposedly so that we would not target them , " Tice told Olbermann .
" What I was finding out , though , is that the collection on those organizations was 24/7 and 365 days a year -- and it made no sense .
... I started to investigate that .
That 's about the time when they came after me to fire me . "
When Olbermann pressed him for specifics ,
Tice offered , " An organization that was collected on were US news organizations and reporters and journalists . "
" To what purpose ? " Olbermann asked .
" I mean , is there a file somewhere full of every email sent by all the reporters at the New York Times ?
Is there a recording somewhere of every conversation I had with my little nephew in upstate New York ? "
Tice did not answer directly , but simply stated , " If it was involved in this specific avenue of collection , it would be everything . "
He added , however , that he had no idea what was ultimately done with the information , except that he was sure it " was digitized and put on databases somewhere . "
Tice first began alleging that there were illegal activities going on at both the NSA and the Defense Intelligence Agency in December 2005 , several months after being fired by the NSA .
He also served at that time as a source for the New York Times story which revealed the existence of the NSA 's warrantless wiretapping program .
Over the next several months , however , Tice was frustrated in his attempts to testify before Congress , had his credibility attacked by Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh , and was subpoenaed by a federal grand jury in an apparent attempt at intimidation .
Tice is now coming forward again now because George Bush is finally out of office .
He told Olbermann that the Obama administration has not been in touch with him about his latest revelations , but , " I did send a letter to , I think it 's [ Obama intelligence adviser John ] Brennan -- a handwritten letter , because I knew all my communications were tapped , my phones , my computer , and I 've had the FBI on me like flies on you - know - what ... and I 'm assuming that he gave the note to our current president -- that I intended to say a little bit more than I had in the past .

Sources told ESPN
The Magazine 's Buster Olney that Hoffman has agreed to a deal with Milwaukee .
Terms were not immediately available , but early in the process , Milwaukee had offered the closer a one - year contract with an option for a second .
According to multiple media reports , Hoffman will make $ 6 million in 2009 .
The 41 - year - old Hoffman had pitched for the San Diego Padres since 1993 , but the team recently withdrew its offer for next season .
Hoffman posted 30 saves last season , then became a free agent .
The NL West champion Los Angeles Dodgers showed considerable interest in the right - hander .
Hoffman earned all but two of his 554 career saves for the Padres over 16 seasons .
Hoffman 's agent , Rick Thurman , credited Milwaukee for being " diligent and aggressive " in its pursuit of Hoffman after Brewers players called to recruit him .
A number of friends who will now be teammates called and let him know that Milwaukee was a great place to play and live in , " Thurman said in an e-mail to The Associated Press .
" At the end of the day , that made a big difference .
It made a huge difference the last 16 years in San Diego .
That 's why he always stayed there instead of opting to go elsewhere for more money .
He now looks forward to a new beginning and a new era in Milwaukee . "
Milwaukee , the NL wild - card champion last year , was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Philadelphia .
Bolstering the bullpen was a big need for the Brewers this winter -- Salomon Torres , who led the team with 28 saves , retired and reliever Eric Gagne filed for free agency .
The Brewers recently signed reliever Jorge Julio , but kept looking for help .
Hoffman converted 30 of 34 chances last season .
The face of the Padres ' franchise since Tony Gwynn retired , Hoffman had once hoped to hear AC / DC's " Hells Bells " on jogs to San Diego 's mound for the rest of his career .
Contract talks with the Padres soured , however , and the team pulled its offer of $ 4 million for 2009 with a club option for $ 4 million in 2010 .
San Diego finished last in the NL West , 21 games behind the Dodgers .
Hoffman was 3 - 6 with a 3.77 ERA in 48 games .
Relying on a wicked changeup , he has saved at least 30 games in 13 seasons , another major league record .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .
WASHINGTON  House and Senate leaders on Wednesday struck a deal on a $ 789 billion economic stimulus bill after little more than 24 hours of rapid - fire negotiations with the Obama administration , clearing the way for final Congressional action later this week .
The package of spending increases and tax relief , intended to spur an economic recovery and create jobs by putting money back in the pockets of consumers and companies , ended up smaller than either the House or Senate had proposed .
Many Democrats would have preferred a larger bill , but agreed to pare back , including cuts to favored education and health programs , to win three crucial Republican votes in the Senate .
“ Legislation is the art of compromise , consensus building , and that ’s what we did , ” the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , said in announcing the accord .
Begala calls Limbaugh “ a corpulent drug addict ”
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYBe2PUgHh8After former Maryland governor Michael Steele was named Republican National Committee chairman , CNN ’s ever - pleasant Paul Begala said , “ The real leader of the Republican Party in America today is a corpulent drug addict with an AM radio talk show , Rush Limbaugh . ”
He continued by saying Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is “ very bitter , and divisive , ” that George W. Bush was a “ spectacularly lazy president , ” and “ Obama is stylistically much more like Reagan . ”
Then Begala said , “ Look at the pretty birdies .
I like the pretty birdies .
The pretty birdies make me happy . ”
At which point his caretakers took him back to his nice , padded room .
Michael Phelps Suspended , Dropped By Kellogg's
The recent firestorm surrounding Olympic swimmercontinues to have fallout for the hero athlete .
He admitted over the weekend that he had smoked marijuana at a party in November 2008 .
Phelps found out yesterday that he has been suspended for three months from competitive swimming by its governing body , USA Swimming .
They have also withdrawn their financial support for the athlete .
In a statement yesterday , they said :
" This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated , but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people , particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero .
Michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust . "
Earlier in the day Thursday , the Kellogg Company said it will not renew Phelps ' advertising contract .
" Michael 's recent behavior is not consistent with the image of Kellogg .
His contract expires at the end of February , and we have made a decision not to extend it . "
To add further to Phelps ' woes , the Richland County South Carolina sheriff 's department is looking into whether Phelps smoked marijuana on the University of South Carolina campus .
They plan to file criminal charges if it is determined that he did .
Phelps has endorsement contracts with a significant number of top branded companies .
No word yet on whether they will follow Kellogg 's lead and sever ties with the winner of 14 Olympic gold medals .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
To sum up Timothy Geithner 's plan in a few words , not everyone is going to live happily ever after .
The nation 's new Treasury secretary unveiled a plan to stem the financial crisis through a multipronged approach that he admitted " will cost money , involve risk and take time . "
See full story .
" We will have to try things we 've never tried before , " he said .
" We will make mistakes .
We will go through periods in which things get worse and progress is uneven or interrupted . "
Wall Street 's reaction ?
A sinking feeling .
As Geithner spelled out the plan , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % slumped more than 200 points .
The S&P 500 Index SPX , - 0.48 % fell almost 3 % .
Read more in Market Snapshot .
Geithner was right about the mistakes .
He made a few on the way to today 's announcement , which was delayed .
By leaking parts of the plan to the media , the ultimate unveiling seemed stale .
It was n't as if the proposals such as the government backing private investors included many fresh ideas .
As RBS Greenwich Capital 's Alan Ruskin noted , the leaked plan was " worryingly short on new initiatives . "
But if there is n't ingenuity , there is a refreshing acknowledgement of the depths of the crisis .
Geithner has recognized that the existing Troubled Asset Relief Program is too small and the only balance sheet big enough to lift up the banks is that of the Federal Reserve .
Conservatively , Geithner is talking about a $ 500 billion to $ 1 trillion " bad bank " to buy troubled assets and another $ 1 trillion in consumer loans .
Private investors will enjoy almost a risk - free ability to trade the securities as the government guarantees a minimum price .
Again , that 's not a new idea , but it does acknowledge the critical state of affairs in America 's banking system .
The problem for Geithner , as it was for his predecessor , Henry Paulson , is putting a value on the securities .
Critics argue that Geithner 's plan could potentially make the situation worse because of a mortgage - mitigation plan the Treasury is considering .
Recasting mortgage values would make it more difficult for banks to value the already illiquid mortgage assets .

It 's not a guaranteed happy ending , but it is action .

An artist concept of proposed mission to the Jupiter system , the Europa Jupiter System Mission could launch in 2020 .
Thisstory was updated at 5:50 p.m. EST .
NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) are pushing ahead with proposals to sendambitious new missions to explore Jupiter , Saturn and the many moons thatcircle both planets , the two space agencies announced Wednesday .
The proposedmissions call for sending multiple spacecraft tothe Jupiter and Saturn systems to explore the gas giant planets and theirunique satellites , such as Jupiter ?s ice - covered Europa and Saturn ?s shroudedmoon Titan .
? It ?s justa remarkable effort that I see , ? said Jim Green , director of NASA ?s planetary sciencedivision , in a teleconference with reporters .
?
The communities have really cometogether on both sides of the pond .?
NASA andESA officials announced plans for the flagship mission proposals and a roughschedule for the first to fly - the Jupiter - bound expedition - on Wednesday aftera meeting between the two space agencies in Washington , D.C. , last week .
NASA envisionslaunching its Jupiter and Saturn probes atop expendable Atlas 5 rockets , U.S.space agency officials said .
" Thedecision means a win , win situation for all parties involved , " said EdWeiler , NASA ?s associate administrator for science missions at the agency ?
sheadquarters in Washington , D.C. " Although the Jupiter system mission hasbeen chosen to proceed to an earlier flight opportunity , a Saturn systemmission clearly remains a high priority for the science community . "
Returnto Jupiter
Dubbed the EuropaJupiter System Mission , the Jupiter - bound expedition would send two orbiting spacecraftto study the planet and its large moons
Io , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto inunprecedented detail , NASA officials said .
NASA wouldbuild one orbiter , the Jupiter Europa , while ESA would provide the other , Jupiter Ganymede .
The spacecraft would launch in 2020 from different spaceportswith the goal of reaching Jupiter by 2026 and spending three years studying theplanet and its moons , NASA officials said .
NASA ?sshare in the mission could cost up to $ 3 billion , while Europe has set asideabout 850 million euro ( about $ 1 billion ) for its next flagship mission .
The European Jupiter probe is also known as Laplace at ESA .
While neithermission is currently fully funded , NASA is setting aside about $ 10 million tocontinue studying design challenges for its Jupiter Europa orbiter , Green said .
NASA ?s lastdedicated mission to Jupiter was Galileo , which spent eight years studying theplanet and its moons before intentionally plunging into the gas giant in 2003to end its flight .
The next probe slated to fly to the planet is NASA ?s Juno , which is scheduled for an August 2011 launch .
? For the Jupiter Europa mission , the overarching goal is to investigate the emergence ofpotentially habitable worlds around gas giants , ? said Curt Niebur , NASA ? sprogram scientist for the outer planets .
?
We?ll take a close look at Europa , tobetter define its habitability .?
Jupiter ? smoon Europa is covered with a thick crust of ice that hides what astronomersbelieve to be a vast liquid ocean beneath its frozen exterior .
In addition to studying Jupiter itself and flying by its other large satellites , NASA ?s Jupiter Europa spacecraftwould be able to orbit Europa and build global maps of the moon ?s surface , topography and composition .
A ground - penetrating radar and gravity - measuringsensors would also probe Europa ?s interior to obtain definitive proof whetherthe underground ocean exists .
? We allfirmly believe that there ?s an ocean under the ice of Europa , ?
Niebur said .
?
Thismission is going to verify that using three different lines of inquiry .?
Europe ?s Jovianprobe would mirror NASA ?s in - depth scrutiny of Europa at Ganymede , which is the largestof Jupiter ?s moons , as well as the largest natural satellite in the solar system .
The moon is larger than the planet Mercury .
While NASA ?s spacecraft will end its mission inorbit around Europa , Europe ?s would do so circling Ganymede , NASA officials said .
Sailingto Saturn
Like theproposed Jupiter mission , the Saturn expedition would consist of both NASA and European spacecraft .
Dubbed the TitanSaturn System mission , the flagship flight would include a NASA - builtorbiter to study Saturn and its moons , as well as European lander and researchballoon to continue the exploration of the planet ?s cloud - covered moon Titan .
Saturn ?s moon Enceladus , which harbors ice - spewinggeysers , is also major target for that mission .
ESA officials havereferred to their mission to Saturn and Titan as Tandem .
Thedaunting technical hurdles involved in assembling the mission will require morestudy and technology development before the flight can go forward , NASAofficials said .
Those hurdles , which include trying to keep spacecraft trimenough to fit on their rockets , led NASA and ESA officials to propose flying the Jupiter mission first , they added .
? Titan willnot be forgotten , ?
Green said .
Under NASA ? scurrent plan , the Titan Saturn System mission would take about 10 1/2 years to reachSaturn if it launched in the 2020 timeframe .
NASA ?s orbiter would spend abouttwo years circling Saturn to study the planet , Enceladus and other moons , andthen spend about 1 1/2 years in orbit around Titan , Niebur said .
Niebur saidTitan ?s major draw is its chemistry , which appears to have many parallels to whatthe early Earth may have been like in the ancient past .
Images and data fromthe Cassini orbiter have found evidence of liquidmethane lakes and rain on the cloudy Saturnian moon .
? Titan isfelt to be a very Earth - like world in terms of the processes going on , ?
Niebursaid .
Meanwhile , the Cassini orbiter managed by NASA , ESA and the Italian SpaceAgency is currently in orbit around Saturn , where it has been studying theplanet and its many moons sinceit arrived in June 2004 .
The orbiter ?s European - built Huygens landersuccessfully touched down on Titan ?s surface in January 2005 .
Missionmanagers are pushing to extend Cassini ?s flight by seven years to 2017 .
" Thisjoint endeavour is a wonderful new exploration challenge and will be a landmarkof 21st century planetary science , " said David Southwood , ESA ?s directorof science and robotic exploration .
" What I am especially sure of is thatthe cooperation across the Atlantic that we have had so far and we see in thefuture , between America and Europe , NASA and ESA , and in our respective sciencecommunities is absolutely right .
Let 's get to work . "
Yesterday I accidentally conducted a denial of service attack on my iPhone , using VOIP call flooding .
I failed to turn off the ' call workers ' on one instance of a Scalr server farm , and then proceeded to load test it with valid POSTs to queue calls in the database .
50 call workers processes then began to pull call information from the queue - which contained 39,000 records , to make 50 calls simultaneously - to my cell phone .
It began to ring .
Each time I pushed end call another was there .
AT&T managed to deliver 37 simultaneous voicemails .
In a couple minutes I managed to shut down the call workers and the flood ceased .
Sort of .
I kept getting voicemails in blocks of 90 at a time for the rest of the day .
The voice was me as ' Vinnie ' threatening my life .
It was kinda creepy .
For a while my service turned off .
Checking the logs , it seems that out of 350 or so calls that were made , about 300 got through and were able to leave messages .
I find this somewhat impressive , but part of me regrets not spawning 500 call workers instead of 50 to see what the network could really handle .
I do n't know if this has security implications beyond being humorous , but it is worth noting that every major VoiceXML / VOIP software provider provides developer accounts without much in the way of credentials .
These accounts provide free outbound calling minutes for development purposes .
It is also trivial to buy minutes in blocks from these same providers .
Probably you could use this as a real DOS attack on someone 's phone , or on an entire company or government agency 's telephone system , if you had enough accounts distributed across providers .

Haruki Murakami Fucks Shit Up at the 24th Jerusalem Book Fair
Generally speaking , Haruki Murakami does n't pick up his prizes in person , but when he was informed that he won this year 's Jerusalem Prize for the Freedom of the Individual , he decided to attend .
Standing next to President Shimon Peres , here was his speech : " Good evening .
I have come to Jerusalem today as a novelist , which is to say as a professional spinner of lies .
"
Of course , novelists are not the only ones who tell lies .
Politicians do it , too , as we all know .
Diplomats and generals tell their own kinds of lies on occasion , as do used car salesmen , butchers and builders .
The lies of novelists differ from others , however , in that no one criticizes the novelist as immoral for telling lies .
Indeed , the bigger and better his lies and the more ingeniously he creates them , the more he is likely to be praised by the public and the critics .
Why should that be ?
" My answer would be this : namely , that by telling skilful lies -- which is to say , by making up fictions that appear to be true -- the novelist can bring a truth out to a new place and shine a new light on it .
In most cases , it is virtually impossible to grasp a truth in its original form and depict it accurately .
This is why we try to grab its tail by luring the truth from its hiding place , transferring it to a fictional location , and replacing it with a fictional form .
In order to accomplish this , however , we first have to clarify where the truth -- lies within us , within ourselves .
This is an important qualification for making up good lies .
" Today , however , I have no intention of lying .
I will try to be as honest as I can .
There are only a few days in the year when I do not engage in telling lies , and today happens to be one of them .
" Today , I will tell you the truth .
In Japan a fair number of people advised me not to come here to accept the Jerusalem Prize .
Some even warned me they would instigate a boycott of my books if I came .
The reason for this , of course , was the fierce fighting that was raging in Gaza .
The U.N. reported that more than a thousand people had lost their lives in the blockaded city of Gaza , many of them unarmed citizens -- children and old people .
" Any number of times after receiving notice of the award , I asked myself whether traveling to Israel at a time like this and accepting a literary prize was the proper thing to do , whether this would create the impression that I supported one side in the conflict , that I endorsed the policies of a nation that chose to unleash its overwhelming military power .
Neither , of course , do I wish to see my books subjected to a boycott .
" Finally , however , after careful consideration , I made up my mind to come here .
One reason for my decision was that all too many people advised me not to do it .
Perhaps , like many other novelists , I tend to do the exact opposite of what I am told .
If people are telling me -- and especially if they are warning me -- " Do n't go there , " " Do n't do that , " I tend to want to " go there " and " do that . "
It 's in my nature , you might say , as a novelist .
Novelists are a special breed .
They cannot genuinely trust anything they have not seen with their own eyes or touched with their own hands .
" And that is why I am here .
I chose to come here rather than stay away .
I chose to see for myself rather than not to see .
I chose to speak to you rather than to say nothing .
" Please do allow me to deliver a message , one very personal message .
It is something that I always keep in mind while I am writing fiction .
I have never gone so far as to write it on a piece of paper and paste it to the wall : rather , it is carved into the wall of my mind , and it goes something like this : " Between a high , solid wall and an egg that breaks against it , I will always stand on the side of the egg . "
" Yes , no matter how right the wall may be and how wrong the egg , I will stand with the egg .
Someone else will have to decide what is right and what is wrong ; perhaps time or history will do it .
But if there were a novelist who , for whatever reason , wrote works standing with the wall , of what value would such works be ?
" What is the meaning of this metaphor ?
In some cases , it is all too simple and clear .
Bombers and tanks and rockets and white phosphorus shells are that high wall .
The eggs are the unarmed civilians who are crushed and burned and shot by them .
This is one meaning of the metaphor .
" But this is not all .
It carries a deeper meaning .
Think of it this way .
Each of us is , more or less , an egg .
Each of us is a unique , irreplaceable soul enclosed in a fragile shell .
This is true of me , and it is true of each of you .
And each of us , to a greater or lesser degree , is confronting a high , solid wall .
The wall has a name : it is " The System . "
The System is supposed to protect us , but sometimes it takes on a life of its own , and then it begins to kill us and cause us to kill others -- coldly , efficiently , systematically .
" I have only one reason to write novels , and that is to bring the dignity of the individual soul to the surface and shine a light upon it .
The purpose of a story is to sound an alarm , to keep a light trained on the System in order to prevent it from tangling our souls in its web and demeaning them .
I truly believe it is the novelist 's job to keep trying to clarify the uniqueness of each individual soul by writing stories -- stories of life and death , stories of love , stories that make people cry and quake with fear and shake with laughter .
This is why we go on , day after day , concocting fictions with utter seriousness .
" My father passed away last year at the age of ninety .
He was a retired teacher and a part - time Buddhist priest .
When he was in graduate school in Kyoto , he was drafted into the army and sent to fight in China .
As a child born after the war , I used to see him every morning before breakfast offering up long , deeply - felt prayers at the small Buddhist altar in our house .
One time I asked him why he did this , and he told me he was praying for the people who had died in the battlefield .
He was praying for all the people who died , he said , both ally and enemy alike .
Staring at his back as he knelt at the altar , I seemed to feel the shadow of death hovering around him .
" My father died , and with him he took his memories , memories that I can never know .
But the presence of death that lurked about him remains in my own memory .
It is one of the few things I carry on from him , and one of the most important .
" I have only one thing I hope to convey to you today .
We are all human beings , individuals transcending nationality and race and religion , and we are all fragile eggs faced with a solid wall called The System .
To all appearances , we have no hope of winning .
The wall is too high , too strong -- and too cold .
If we have any hope of victory at all , it will have to come from our believing in the utter uniqueness and irreplaceability of our own and others ' souls and from our believing in the warmth we gain by joining souls together .
" Take a moment to think about this .
Each of us possesses a tangible , living soul .
The System has no such thing .
We must not allow the System to exploit us .
We must not allow the System to take on a life of its own .
The System did not make us : we made the System .
" That is all I have to say to you .
" I am grateful to have been awarded the Jerusalem Prize .
I am grateful that my books are being read by people in many parts of the world .
And I would like to express my gratitude to the readers in Israel .
You are the biggest reason why I am here .
And I hope we are sharing something , something very meaningful .
And I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak to you here today .
Thank you very much .
" He seemed to be having a good time : The biennial Jerusalem Prize is $ 2000 , which probably did n't cover the cost of Murakami 's plane ticket .

The second day of Coleman 's Election Contest was supposed to begin at 9 AM CT ; as you can see below , that simply did not happen :
9:12 AM CT : Nothing has happened yet , but I did snag a picture of the binder containing Exhibits C1 and C2 .
I do n't know If all twelve binders make up the Exhibits , or if the binders are just stockpiled for later distribution .
There was also a box that appeared to contain ballots , its impossible to know at this point , but it did resemble previous boxes used for storing ballots .
9:23 AM CT : Nothing has happened yet , I do n't know if there is a delay or if the court simply was n't scheduled to begin yet .
Apparently the start of proceedings is delayed , possibly until 10:00 AM CT .
10:17 AM CT : The proceedings have been delayed ; the judges are in a private meeting .
A time for resumption has not been specified .
Gary Poser , the Deputy Secretary of State , was just spotted in the Judicial Center .
12:37 AM CT : The trial will apparently resume at 1:00 PM CT ; which just so happens to be the exact same time as when I need to leave .
2:35 PM CT : The Coleman campaign is calling a series of witness whose absentee ballots were rejected .
Douglas Thompson took the stand at this time .
" Is this your signature on the absentee ballot envelope " Yes .
Is this your signature on the absentee ballot application .
No .
It appears as though the Franken attorney established probable cause for rejection of Douglas ' absentee ballot envelope .
2:38 PM CT : Jim Gelbmann , Dep. Sec. of State . will now take the stand .
He worked for Sen. Mark Dayton ( D ) .
2:41 PM CT : I do n't know where they are going with this witness , and I do n't have time to find out ; more later .
7:41 PM CT : I 'll have a more thorough update later tonight , or tomorrow morning .
Summary [ 11:43 PM
CT ] :
When the court finally resumed , Judge Denise Reilly explained the circumstances behind the delay :
[ The ] Secretary of State 's Office , the AGs , the attorney for the petitioner , as well as the three of us and our law clerks meet for almost all morning trying to work out the logistics of how to get the best evidence to this courtroom so that we can make the findings of fact that we need to make .
We also understand that the municipalities and the 87 counties that are holding these original documents are under stress and strain for budgetary reasons and that 's why we want to see if there is someway for us to streamline the process .
Having said that , Mr. Friedberg [ Coleman Attorney ] had Ms. Sonnen on the stand yesterday when we ended .
Source : TheUpTake.org via Mogulus
The proceedings began , and six , civilian witnesses were called throughout the day 's proceedings ; their pictures are below :
Mr. Friedberg stared by asking that Ms. Sonnen 's testimony ( from yesterday ) be stricken from the record and the court moved forward with a slight objection from Marc Elias ; I believe Elias wanted to question Ms. Sonnen , but she was not present .
Coleman Attorney , Mr. Langdon , then proceeded by calling a new witness ; Gerald Walter Anderson [ 1 ] a voter whose absentee ballot was not counted .
Gerald Anderson first voted in " 1952 for Eisenhower ; " he is blind and is 75 years of age .
Mr. Anderson mentioned repeated a similar refrain through his testimony ; " my vote was not counted in America . "
The Coleman campaign seemed to be appealing for empathy , but they make an interesting case .
They appear to be arguing that his vote should count because he says he signed his absentee ballot properly .
Upon cross examination Mr. Anderson failed to recall when he signed his affidavit , he stated " Friday , " but the affidavit was dated January 20th .
Mr. Anderson was then allowed to leave .
Eugene Carl Markmen [ 2 ] was then called to the stand by Mr. Langdon .
He lives in Sterns County and voted by absentee because he was an election judge .
He has voted absentee before .
As an election judge he stated that his ballot was likely rejected " because the 'n ' on the end of my name is not got two humps in it , it has one hump and a line that goes straight down . "
In the cross examination , Mr. Marken stated that he was asked to intervene in the lawsuit by Publica .
Mr. Markmen stepped down .
Kevin Hendrickson [ 3 ] was then called as the next witness , but before he could take the stand the Franken campaign objected because " this individual was not on the list . "
The court allowed the witness , but will take the objection under advisement .
Mr. Hendrickson is from Zimmerman and was eligible to vote in the past two elections ; he stated that he " voted in the past two . "
The Coleman campaign basically established that Mr. Hendrickson does not know why his vote was not counted .
Mr. Hamiltion , of the Franken campaign , then tried to deduce what the witness " does not know , " by asking him who rejected his ballot ; Mr. Hendrickson confirmed that he did not know .
The next witness was Wesley A. Briest [ 4 ] .
The Coleman attorney began by asking Mr. Briest how he voted .
Mr. Briest responded by saying that he " went to the voting place and voted , not by absentee . "
He was however called to the stand because he voted absentee , the Coleman lawyer corrected his previous assertion by providing a document of his absentee ballot envelope .
Mr. Briest then asserted that he had voted absentee .
During the cross examination , Franken 's representation suggested that Mr. Briest may have voted in person on election day as well as by absentee ; Mr. Briest denied this assertion and affirmed his earlier claim that he had voted by absentee only .
The Franken Attorney then asked Mr. Briest to observe that the address box for a " non-notary witness " was not filled in on the absentee ballot envelope ; Mr. Briest then acknowledged that the form was not completed .
The Coleman campaign responded by asking where his wife lived and Mr. Briest replied " with me at the same address . "
The Franken side then argued that this fact was not stated anywhere on the envelope .
Mr. Briest was excused .
Mijanou Rodriguez Sampers [ 5 ] was the next witness ; she resides in Rosemount and is a registered voter who cast an absentee ballot in the November 4th election .
Mr. Langdon essentially confirmed that Ms. Sampers could identify her own signature on her own absentee ballot .
Mr. Hamilton then lead the cross examination ; he preceeded in a manner very congruent with his cross examination of Mr. Hendrickson .
Mr. Hamilton then learned that the Republican Party contacted Ms. Sampers and alerted told her that her ballot was rejected ; the Republican party contacted the previous 4 witness as well .
Mr. Langdon concluded by establishing that Ms. Sampers did request an absentee ballot .
She had not been shown her absentee ballot request form .
She was then allowed to step down .
And the final civilian witness brought forth by the Coleman campaign ; Douglas Thompson [ 6 ] .
His girlfriend , " of 20 years " filled out his absentee ballot request form .
The Coleman campaign then asserted , with Mr. Thompson 's assistance , that he had filled out the actual absentee ballot himself .
The Republican Party contacted Mr. Thompson as well , informing him that his ballot was not counted .
The witness believes that his vote was not counted because his girlfriend signed his name on the request form , and he signed his own name on the actual ballot .
Witness dismissed .
The common theme amongst all Coleman witnesses seems to center around the voter 's claim of wrongful rejection , not necessarily the legal claim regarding the rejection .
Both campaign 's attorney 's were very polite to the witness throughout the day 's events .
Jim Gelbmann , Dep. Sec. of State. was then called to the witness stand to testify .
The Coleman campaign essentially asked Jim Gelbmann to define the process by which wrongfully rejected absentee ballots .
were counted .
The Coleman campaign was attempting to show that these ballots were not treated equally by each of Minnesota 's 87 counties ; this discrepancy would violate equal protection .
David Lillehaug of the Franken campaign then began the first wave of the cross examination .
It was learned that Jim Gelbmann was put forth by the Secretary of State 's office in response to a subpoena request by the Coleman campaign .
Mr. Gelbmann 's testimony lasted for about an hour and a half ; during that time a recess was ordered .
After the recess , Mr. Gelbmann went through a series of technical details associated with ballot counting law .
He gave specific scenarios related to the requested situations .
At the end of the day Mr. Gelbmann essentially stated that any errors in the counting of wrongfully rejected absentee ballots would have to be addressed by the election worker who dealt with that specific ballot .
He also went on to state that the head election official , for each county , would have adequate knowledge regarding the roughly 1,400 absentee ballots that were presented by the counties , but lower level election workers would have to be consulted for ballots outside of that subset .
Mr. Gelbmann asserted that " each [ ballot ] has a story behind it . "
Mr. Gelbmann then spent the last thirty minutes addressing specific situations for accepting and rejecting absentee ballots in various counties , and the various processes used by these counties .
The witness was then dismissed , for the day .
The Franken campaign then objected to the replacement of sum 500 names to the Coleman campaign 's list of 5,000 voters whose absentee ballots were rejected .
The Coleman campaign said they were unaware of the situation and would look into it .
The Franken campaign stated that this discrepancy was not random .
A backroom meeting was then commissioned , and the court adjourned until 9 AM CT tomorrow .
XENIA , Ohio ( AP ) 
An Ohio man has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for disciplining his children with a dog shock collar .
David Liskany of Jamestown had pleaded guilty to charges of felonious assault and attempted felonious assault .
In court Friday , Greene County Common Pleas Judge J. Timothy Campbell compared the punishments to torture .
The judge said Liskany punished the children in 2006 and 2007 by putting them in cold showers , holding them underwater and using the shock collar , which is commonly used to train dogs .
The judge said the case sounded " like something from Guantanamo Bay . "
The children are now 5 , 12 and 14 .

There ’s not a lot you can change in the process of constructing a building .
You must lay the foundation before you erect the upper floors , and you ca n’t paint without having the walls in place .
In software , we ’re blessed with more freedom .
I recently experienced this when I implemented wpl , a small system that extends arbitrary Web pages with links to Wikipedia entries .
( Try it at www.spinellis.gr/wpl.)
The system has many parts : tools that convert the Wikipedia index into a longest - prefix search data structure ; an HTML parser ; code that adds links to phrases matching Wikipedia entries ; and a Web front end that fetches the page , adds the links , and returns it back .
As I was adding the finishing touches , I reflected on the process I used to construct the system .
( I find a postmortem examination deeply satisfying , but this is probably because I ’m not a medical doctor . )
What struck me were the different approaches I used to construct each of the system ’s main parts .
For the search data structure , I worked bottom - up : I first read about and experimented with a couple of alternatives , learning about Bloom filters , tries , and Patricia ( Practical Algorithm to Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric , and I �m not making this up . ) trees .
Next , I designed the data layout and the low - level bit - twiddling code to add and locate entries .
Only then did I write the tools for building the index and an API for searching entries in the data structure .
For the HTML parser and word - linking code , I started somewhere in the middle .
I wrote a state - transition engine to parse “ tag soup ” HTML ( HTML that is n’t necessarily well formed ) , I extended it with code to add links to suitable text , and I added an appropriate interface .
As you ’ll probably expect , for the Web front end , I followed yet another approach , working in a top - down fashion .
I first wrote down the server ’s main tasks and their precise descriptions ; once these were in place I started working on their implementation .
As I reflected on my construction process , I wondered what made me choose three different approaches within a week : bottom - up , middle - out , and top - down .
Are my programming work habits really so chaotic as they appear ?
If so , what am I doing writing columns in a magazine for software professionals ?
The Hidden Logic
Fortunately , I quickly realized there was logic behind my choices .
On each subsystem , I started on the most difficult part ; the one with the largest number of known unknowns .
For term searching , this was the data structure and the associated code .
I needed a structure where I could quickly search ( thousands of times for each processed page ) for a page ’s words and phrases matching one of the millions of Wikipedia entries .
For this , the structure should be compact enough to fit in memory , yet flexible to allow for longest - prefix matching — a tall order .
Once I had solved this low - level problem ( by using a space - optimized version of a Patricia tree ) , designing an API and building the indexing tools were easy .
Similarly , the most difficult problem in the page - processing part was the HTML parsing .
On the basis of Postel ’s law , “ be conservative in what you do ; be liberal in what you accept from others , ” code that processes Web pages should be able to parse anything that remotely looks like HTML .
In my system I had to do this efficiently for the very narrow task of recognizing word sequences that could be linked to Wikipedia .
In this case , the high - level interface and the lower - level word search and replacement code were considerably easier , so I ended up starting in the middle .
Finally , when the time came to implement the Web front end , I initially experienced writer ’s block , not knowing where to start .
I realized I had no clear understanding of how the various pieces would fit together : how to obtain the Web request ’s parameters ( to which language ’s Wikipedia to link , and what character encoding to use ) , when to retrieve the page , what to do with the HTTP header I received , and how to construct the response ’s header .
I escaped this impasse only when I designed the functionality in a top - down fashion , a choreography that I expressed in just nine lines of high - level C++ code .
Once I had those lines in front of me , I could easily see what each part would need to do .
When I was ready to code the low - level functionality , the actual mechanics of setting up socket communications and talking HTTP were ( almost ) boring details .
... And Its Advantages ...
Starting with the most difficult part has three main advantages .
The most important concerns the management of design constraints .
On a blank sheet of paper , the constraints we face are minimal , but each design decision imposes new restrictions .
By starting with the most difficult task , we ensure that we ’ll face the fewest possible constraints and therefore have the maximum freedom to tackle it .
When we then work on the easier parts , the existing constraints are less restraining and can even give us helpful guidance .
For instance , when I designed the search data structure in a bottom - up fashion , I realized that choosing the UTF - 8 variable - length character encoding had significant advantages in terms of space and time efficiency .
Had I started my work top - down by specifying an API that mandated the use of wide characters , I might have needlessly constrained my choice of the data structure .
In contrast , when designing the Web front end , having various ill - fitting pieces of functionality would make it more difficult to assemble them into an efficient whole .
So in that case , top - down design was appropriate .
The second advantage is the early shrinking of the project ’s cone of uncertainty .
Any development project involves elements that we do n’t know at the beginning and discover as we progress .
By putting the most difficult ( and consequently risky ) part quickly behind us , we rapidly minimize the project ’s unknowns and can therefore make more informed and intelligent decisions regarding budget , progress , staffing , and functionality .
The final advantage has to do with human nature .
At a project ’s beginning , we have the highest levels of enthusiasm and motivation ; at later stages we can expect some disillusionment and even burnout .
By starting with the most difficult part , we ensure that we undertake it with a positive can - do attitude rather than a defeatist spirit .
We can even apply this principle on a smaller scale by scheduling difficult work early in the day when the mind is clear and distractions are minimal .
Plan boring meetings where they belong : at the end of the day .
... Further Applied
You can also apply the principle I ’ve described when ordering elements of the software life cycle : requirements elicitation , high - and low - level design , coding , debugging , testing , and maintenance .
Yes , if you ’re venturing into an unknown application territory , start by gathering requirements .
Change your plan , however , if you know approximately what you need to do , you have a good communication channel with your users , and the most difficult part of the project is , for instance , how you ’ll display a complex data set .
In this case , your problem is not the project ’s requirements but its rendering functionality .
Therefore , spend some time experimenting with what you can achieve with , say , OpenGL or Ajax .
Then , when you ’re discussing requirements with your users , you can steer them toward the technically achievable directions rather than letting them specify functionality that will be costly to implement .
Along the same lines , if you think that testing will be more difficult than low - level coding ( it frequently is in many application domains ) , start by writing your test cases .
If you believe that maintaining your system will involve a lot of effort , plan ahead by designing a domain - specific language that will simplify the most common maintenance tasks .
If your design involves a large API , sketch its conventions before specifying its actual elements .
If you think your code will need a lot of debugging , sprinkle liberally assertions , logging , and hooks .
The list goes on .
Whatever you do , just remember : start with the most difficult part .

Mr Chavez has often been critical of Israel and its policies
Venezuela has ordered the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador to Caracas in protest at Israel 's offensive in the Gaza Strip .
A number of diplomatic staff have been expelled along with Shlomo Cohen .
President Hugo Chavez has strongly condemned Israel for its actions and called on Israelis to stand up against their government .
Venezuela is the first country to take such a diplomatic step in protest at the violence in Gaza .
" The Israeli army is cowardly attacking worn - out , innocent people , while they claim that they are defending their people , " Mr Chavez said during a visit to a children 's hospital in Caracas .
" I call on the people of Israel to stand up against that government , to demand , to put a hand on their hearts and look at their children , and I call on the world to stop this madness . "
Shortly after , the foreign ministry released a statement ordering the expulsion of Mr Cohen and some of his staff , in what they said was a show of solidarity with the Palestinians .
The BBC's Will Grant in Caracas says Mr Chavez often uses strong language to criticise Israel and is a close ally of Iranian President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , one of Israel 's main enemies .
Venezuela also has a large Arab community who have welcomed the government 's move , our correspondent adds .

OTTAWA — Advocates seeking the return of Guantanamo detainee Omar Khadrsought to pressure the Conservative government today with the release of a letter signed by 185 groups and individuals , representing a range of Canadian community leaders , academics , human rights advocates and civil liberties organizations .
Khadr , a Canadian citizen charged in the death of a U.S. army medic during a gunfight in Afghanistan , is the only remaining Westerner still imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay , the military prison that U.S. President Barack Obama is shutting down .
An open letter released today by the Canadian Council on American Islamic Relations ( CAIR - CAN ) urges Prime Minister Stephen Harper to respond to the move by Obama with an offer to repatriate Khadr in order to rehabilitate him and re-integrate him into Canadian society .
The letter is copied to the leaders of the three Opposition parties as well .
Signed by Muslim and non-Muslim lawyers , academics , and public policy commentators , the letter says Harper 's silence and inaction on Khadr 's case is much different than his approach to other cases , and suggests it is motivated by a lack of regard for Muslim Canadians .
" Silence is no longer an option .
We believe that your inaction with regards to this important case , compared to your active involvement in other cases ( such as the repatriation of Brenda Martin from Mexico ) , has been , rightly or wrongly , interpreted by the Muslim community as indicative that your government considers Canadian Muslims to be second - class citizens . "
The letter , signed by CAIR - CAN 's executive director Ihsaan Gardee on behalf of a long list of signatories , says Harper should counter the " growing perception within the Muslim community " and seek Khadr 's return .
The signatories to the letter say there is " no doubt " Khadr was a child soldier at the time he was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan .
They counter the government 's repeated insistence that the allegations against Khadr are " very serious " with the observation that " revelations about the evidence against him cast more and more doubt as to the veracity of those allegations . "
The letter says it is " now clear that Omar Khadr has been tortured and abused , in Afghanistan and at Guantánamo Bay , by his American captors for over six years . "
With an executive order that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp will close , and offers by European countries to take individuals who are non-citizens , the signatories state the Harper government 's stance is " in stark contrast to that spirit of generosity . "
" We do hope that your government will reverse its position immediately and ask for Omar Khadr 's repatriation to Canada without any further delay .
He deserves rehabilitation and justice and he can only receive them in his country of citizenship . "
Among the groups which signed are Arab Canadian Lawyers Association , Canadian Arab Federation , Canadian Islamic Congress , Canadian Muslim Civil Liberties Association , International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group and the Salaheddin Islamic Centre .

Human Rights commission director Kathleen Ruff , and several lawyers involved in other national security cases .

The presidential campaign of 2008 seems pretty far off these days .
An economic collapse will do that .
But given the profound challenges facing the nation and the president these days , it ’s worth reviewing the media coverage of the race to see if journalists last year effectively probed the candidates vying to lead the country through a difficult period .
Sadly , there were far more media lowlights than highlights during the campaign , as too many reporters and pundits focused on flag pins , bowling , and fairly trivial faux pas .
One could do a full article just on William Kristol ’s errors and flubs at the New York Times ( my favorite coming when Kristol touted Clarence Thomas for vice president long before he fell in love with Sarah Palin ) .
Moreover , it often seemed that America was trapped in an alternative universe shaped by the media , with John McCain running against some scary , inexperienced , part - Muslim who was palling around with Weathermen radicals and terrorists .
Then the votes were counted , and the boogeyman was gone .
Today , even half the people who voted for McCain say they are optimistic about Barack Obama ’s presidency .
So much of the media ’s performance ended up not mattering — or being trumped by other factors .
Going back only to last April , here are some defining media moments of the 2008 campaign
On April 18 , in perhaps the most embarrassing performance by the media in a major presidential debate in years , ABC News hosts Charles Gibson and George Stephanopolous focused mainly on small stuff when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama faced off in Philadelphia .
Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the health care and mortgage crises , the state of the economy , and other pressing issues had to wait until the midway point .
Before then , Obama was pressed to explain ( once again ) his relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and his reason for not wearing a flag pin , while Clinton had to answer for her Bosnia trip exaggerations .
Obama was also forced during this debate to defend his slim association with former 1960s radical Bill Ayers .
This led to Obama ’s claim that Hillary ’s husband pardoned two other radicals .
And so on .
Gibson only got excited when he complained about anyone daring to raise taxes on his capital gains .
Remember “ Bowling - gate ” ?
While campaigning in Pennsylvania , Barack Obama threw a few gutter balls attempting to bowl .
Suddenly many in the media were depicting him as a wimp and out of step with America , even though his skills at playing a far more popular sport ( basketball ) suggested he was actually the best athlete to run in years .
Joe Scarborough at MSNBC opined that Americans want a real macho man in the White House and that Obama was “ prissy . ”
Maureen Dowd actually referred to it as Obama ’s “ bowling debacle . ” Elizabeth Edwards , with so much else on her plate , was driven to write an op -ed for the Times titled “ Bowling 1 , Health Care 0 . ”
In a column , I dubbed it “ the return of gutter politics . ”
Does anyone now care about Obama ’s misadventure in bowling ?
In May , liberal bloggers and commenters at The Washington Post ‘s website rightly criticized a column by syndicated scribe Kathleen Parker that questioned whether Obama “ gets America ” and if his “ DNA ” was “ full - blooded ” enough .
But she was only following the footsteps of Peggy Noonan of the Wall Street Journal who raised similar issues three weeks earlier — and was praised by NBC ’s Brian Williams for a “ Pulitzer ” - worthy effort .
Noonan had written , “ Hillary Clinton is not Barack Obama ’s problem .
America is Mr. Obama ’s problem … [ H ] as he ever gotten misty - eyed over … the Wright Brothers and what kind of country allowed them to go off on their own and change everything ?
How about D - Day , or George Washington , or Henry Ford ? ”
Henry Ford , by the way , was a vicious anti-Semite , but no matter .
Noonan continued : “ John McCain carries it in his bones .
Mr. McCain learned it in school , in the Naval Academy , and , literally , at grandpa ’s knee … Mr. Obama ?
What does he think about all that history ?
Which is another way of saying :
What does he think of America ?
That ’s why people talk about the flag pin absent from the lapel …
But what about Obama and America ?
Who would have taught him to love it …
[ N ] o one is questioning his patriotism , they ’re questioning its content , its fullness . ”
No one ?
Surely not Peggy Noonan .
At the end of May , appearing on Fox News on Sunday , Liz Trotta , a former editor with the Washington Times and broadcast TV journalist , was asked by the host , Eric Shawn , about the latest Clinton controversy —
Hillary ’s remark that people demanding she leave the race ought to remember that Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June of 1968 — that is , late in the campaign .
Trotta replied , “ And now we have what some are reading as a suggestion that somebody knock off Osama , uh Obama .
Well , both , if we could . ”
She laughed .
The host , Shawn , commented : “ Talk about how you really feel ! ” Trotta offered a weak apology the next day .
All was forgiven .
Perhaps the media did , as some have charged , unintentionally help elect Obama — indirectly .
At the Democratic convention in Denver , many reporters provided overblown coverage of the supposed threat of female Hillary delegates and supporters to bolt the Democratic Party and back McCain .
The leaders of this effort received much face time on TV , and political reporters and pundits claimed that this group was merely the tip of the iceberg and that many women , particularly older ones and suburban / blue - collar types who had voted for Hillary in the primaries could abandon the Democrats in November .
There was no firm evidence for this , and few commentators on TV and in print seemed to notice that the same few disgruntled Hillary delegates appeared on all of the shows .
Still , Obama ’s possible defeat because of the possible defections was widely predicted .
John McCain and his people , though , bought this analysis .
And Sarah Palin rose to the top of their VP list .
They saw an opening — which really was n’t there — and went completely overboard .
Not only did a woman VP suddenly look like a great idea , but a folksy one would have extra appeal to the Hillary primary voters so hyped by the media .
Writing in the New York Times , Kate Zernike noted that Democratic women could well flock toward Palin : “ Palin ’s selection unleashes gender as a live issue again , just when Democrats thought they had it under control . ”
But this mass defection would never happen .
Instead , preposterous media coverage of the unhappy Hillaryites apparently had caused McCain to select as his running mate someone who would eventually lessen his chances of victory .
Nothing was more embarrassing for the TV and cable pundits during the fall campaign than the fact that their scoring of the three presidential debates and the single VP debate were regularly undermined by the verdicts of focus groups and instant ( scientific ) polls .
Time and again , most pundits scored a debate even or nearly so , only to discover that in each case the Democrat was overwhelmingly pronounced the victor by voters who watched .
Following the conclusion of each of the four debates , the McCain - Palin “ bounce ” would last barely 30 minutes — until the focus group / poll results came in .
Give the major media outfits credit for this corrective innovation .
Without such polls and focus groups , McCain would have been awarded the “ Big Mo ” or at least the “ Slow Mo ” by out - of - touch pundits .
During the debate between Sarah Palin and Joe Biden , many commentators lowered the bar for the Alaska governor .
David Brooks blurted out at a panel discussion in New York City that Palin was unqualified for her post .
He would not say so , though , in his column .
Rich Lowry of The National Review admitted on the magazine ’s website that he “ sat up a little straighter ” on his sofa , aroused by Palin ’s smile and wink — and claimed that he saw “ starbursts . ”
Other pundits jumped on Joe Biden for referring to people in Bosnia as “ Bosniaks . ”
Turned out he was correct .
And at the first Obama / McCain debate , Tom Brokaw noted that he had received tens of thousands of questions donated by voters — and then he asked the candidates some of the most obvious ones of the entire campaign .
In the final days of the campaign , there were too many media infractions to count or cover : from the sensational coverage of the young woman who supported McCain who was supposedly mugged and “ branded ” by an Obama backer ( a hoax ) to the revival of the William Ayers issue .
But one moment was memorable .
William Kristol appeared once again on The Daily Show , where host Jon Stewart periodically would ask ( rhetorically ) , “ Oh , Bill Kristol , are n’t you ever right ? ”
This night , Kristol , in character , predicted a McCain win .
When Stewart acted doubtful , Kristol dismissed Stewart for depending on conventional media sources : “ You ’re reading the New York Times too much . ”
Stewart replied , “ Bill , you work for the New York Times ! ” Later , Stewart got Kristol to say that Obama was not a radical and would probably be a “ conventional president ” likely to disappoint the left .
Stewart then asked , why are you and McCain calling him a dangerous radical if you do n’t mean it ?
It was a question that could have been asked of many others in the media .
Six people have walked safely to shore after a light plane crash off Darwin 's coastline at East Point around half past eight this morning .
The Piper Chieftain had just left Darwin Airport travelling to the remote Northern Territory community of Maningrida when the pilot started to experience engine trouble .
Local residents say they saw the plane ditch onto a sandbar .
The pilot managed to safely land in the low tide shallow water .
He 's been lauded by emergency services for doing an extraordinary job of getting the plane down without injuries .
The five passengers , who work for Darwin - based information technology services company Connected Solutions Group ( CSG ) and the pilot , walked the 200 metres to shore .
CSG also owns the plane and Managing Director Denis Mackenzie says the company is now making sure staff involved in the accident are being looked after .
" We have other aeroplanes and other pilots and we 'll continue operating , " he says .
" We 'll be offering counselling services to the staff involved here and it 'll be up to the pilot before he decides to fly again . "
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority ( CASA ) will conduct a basic investigation into the crash .
CASA spokesman Peter Gibson says they will be looking for any engineering problems that can be prevented in future .
The plane is now underwater and authorities wo n't be able to retrieve it until low tide tomorrow morning .

The Prisoner
A man escapes from prison where he has been for 15 years .
He breaks into a house to look for money and guns ( obviously an American story )
and finds a young couple in bed .
He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair .
While tying the girl to the bed
he gets on top of her , kisses her neck , then gets up and goes to the bathroom .
While he's in there , the husband tells his wife : " Listen , this guy 's an escaped convict ,
look at his clothes !
He has probably spent lots of time in jail and has n't seen a woman
in years .
I saw how he kissed your neck .
If he wants sex , do n't resist ,
do n't complain , do whatever he tells you .
Satisfy him no matter how much
he nauseates you .
This guy is probably very dangerous if he gets angry ,
he 'll kill us both .
Be strong , honey , I love you . "
To which the wife responded , " he was n't kissing my neck , he was whispering in my ear .
He told me he was gay , thought you were cute , and asked if we had any Vaseline .
I told him it was in the bathroom .
Be strong , honey , I love you too . "

Canadian users again face an increase in the cost of blank CDs , as the Copyright Board has increased levies on them by 38 % .
The raise was authorized in response to rises in music compression and increases in songwriter royalties .
With this rise , the Copyright Board is simply ignoring all technological advances since 1999 , while the music industry enriches itself .
Levies , like them or loathe them , in some countries it ’s the law .
In Canada they were introduced in 1999 , to help offset the alleged losses due to music copying .
The theory goes , that as people are copying music tracks onto blank media , then what they are not doing is paying for another copy of that music .
That Nirvana track you put onto a compilation CD for your drive to and from work , is another copy that you would otherwise have bought ( apparently ) .
So , that loss must be compensated .
For every blank CD sold in Canada , 21 ¢ used to go to the music industry , to compensate Canadian artists .
This has now gone up to 29 ¢ .
However , the levy was introduced before the first iPod was sold , and this immediately brings up one of the key problems .
The question is : How many of the blank CDs that are sold are used to copy Canadian music onto it ?
Furthermore , is it fair to ‘ tax ’ all the other people who buy those CDs for other means ?
It seems that the levy is outdated by technology since most private copies are made on MP3 players , not on CDs .
With the rise of MP3 players , and the ways to get them connected to audio equipment , blank CDs are becoming less relevant in the audio world .
Further , as most computers now come with DVD burners , CDs may be following the floppy as an outdated storage medium .
This raised levy might be the beginning of the end for CDs , at least in Canada .
Of course , the advances in technology were totally ignored by the Copyright Board .
The only technology mention dealt with compression .
Two reasons were given for the raise by the Secretary General of the Copyright Board of Canada , Claude Majeau .
“ Two main factors led the Board to raise the CD levy rate to 29 ¢ .
First , the mechanical royalties that record labels pay to record a song onto a prerecorded CD have increased .
Second , because consumers now use compression technology when they record music , the average number of music tracks copied onto a CD went from 15 to more than 18 . ”
Unfortunately for Mr. Majeau , the second point is greatly undermined by the fact that , according to the audio CD standard ( commonly known as Red Book ) , CDs should n’t be compressed at all .
If he was referring to mp3’s , then reducing the average size from 43 Mb to 36 ( assuming a 650 Mb CD ) is also unusual .
How fair the levies are is debatable .
First , while it claims to be for compensating artists , the Canadian Private Copying Collective ( CPCC ) FAQ makes it clear that only Canadian performers and record companies qualify for payment .
This is a significant blow against non-Canadian artists that do n’t have a Canadian representative – the small artist .
Worse , the payout of the collected levies is based on radio airplay and retail sales ( physical and download ) .
So , a starting Canadian artist that decides to burn 1000 CDs of his demo , he or she is actually paying $ 290 to established musicians and record labels .
There is also the question of payment .
By their own figures , the CPCC had collected almost $ 242 M between 1999 and 2007 , of which just under $ 207 M was available for payouts , but only $ 148.8 M had been distributed , leaving $ 58 M or so sitting around , roughly equivalent to the levies collected in 2006 and 2007 .
Perhaps most unusually of all though , is that some consumers may be entirely unaware of the levies , let alone their rise .
Despite the rise from 21 ¢ to 29 ¢ per disc , newegg.ca is selling spindles of 100 for under $ 20 .
Considering the levy cost on them is now $ 29 , that ’s quite a financial hit .
The price of blank CDs may rise soon to compensate , putting them at similar prices to blank DVDs which have no levies .
Fortunately for consumers , most DVD players can handle MP3s now .
Another great example how technology has advanced since 1999 , and also ignored by the Copyright Board .
Children have been used as ' lab rats ' in GM rice trials that were carried out in breach of ethics rules drawn up in response to the medical crimes of Nazi Germany , it is claimed .
Youngsters aged 6 - 10 were fed so - called Golden Rice , which has been modified to contain enhanced levels of beta carotene or vitamin A .
The rice is being developed to combat Vitamin A deficiency , which is linked to damage to the sight , poor brain development and immune system failure .
However high consumption can also have harmful toxic effects and cause birth defects .
Critics are furious that the GM rice was not put through animal feeding trials to ensure it was safe before being given to children .
The decision to use the children has been condemned as ' completely unacceptable ' by a group of 22 scientists - all GM critics - from Britain and around the world .
They claim it is indicative of moves by the biotech lobby , led by the USA and biotech firms , to force GM food into the mouths of the world without proper assessment .
The project was financed and run through the US National Institutes of Health and involved children in China and America .
The scientists have written an open letter to the team behind the experiments , condemning the way they were conducted .
It states : ' We are writing to express our shock and unequivocal denunciation of the experiments being conducted by your colleagues which involve the feeding of genetically modified Golden Rice to human subjects . '
The letter says there has been ' woefully inadequate pre-clinical evaluation ' of the rice .
The scientists argue there is a large body of evidence showing GM food production can trigger gene mutations which ' can result in health damaging effects when GM food products are fed to animals ' .
The letter adds : ' Our greatest concern is that this rice , which is engineered to overproduce beta carotene , has never been tested in animals ' .
It says there is evidence that certain chemicals derived from beta carotene ' are both toxic and cause birth defects ' .
Critics of the GM experiments says the Nuremburg code states that children under 10 are not considered legally capable of giving consent to participation in such experiments .
They say the code also requires that human guinea pigs should not be used if scientists have an alternative experimental method .
Thirdly , experiments on humans should not be conducted until tests with animals have identified potential hazards .
Among the leading bodies behind the GM Golden rice project are the biotech company Syngenta , the Rockefeller Foundation and the charitable foundation set up by Microsoft boss Bill Gates .
The list of signatories to the protest letter includes Malcolm Hooper , emeritus professor of medicinal chemistry at Sunderland University , who said : ' This type of experimentation is frightening - children as lab rats - it is not on . '
Another is Prof David Schubert , of the Salk Institute of Biological Studies , San Diego , who said : ' It is completely immoral to feed this rice to children without proper safety testing ... It 's like putting a new drug on the market with no toxicology or safety trials . '
Other signatories include Prof Carlo Leifert , director of the Tesco Centre for Organic Agriculture at Newcastle University ; and Dr Stanley WB Ewen .
Dr Ewen was involved in rat feeding trials in Scotland in 1999 which linked GM potatoes to harmful toxic effects .
Dr Brian John , of GM Free Cymru said : ' These irresponsible and dangerous trials must be stopped immediately , and the Golden Rice Project team must put its much - vaunted product through a full and transparent testing process before it is allowed to pass the lips of any other human being . '
Project manager at the Golden Rice Organisation , Dr Adrian Dubock , denied that the Nuremburg Code has been breached .
He said the feeding trials had been approved by independent ethical review panels .
' Parents were not given financial rewards for their children ’s participation - to avoid undue pressure on poor families - but children were rewarded with school bags and pencils and paper as a thank you for participating , ' he said .
Dr Dubock said 6,000 people around the world die every day due to illnesses related to failing immune systems where Vitamin A deficiency is a factor .
' The Golden Rice contains the food colours found everywhere in coloured natural foods and the environment ... There is no possible way the trials could do any harm to the participants . '
Dr Dubock said animal experiments would not have helped .
' As humans are the designed beneficiaries of Golden Rice , animal testing could not answer the questions posed , ' he said .
This appears odd as all GM foods , which are designed to be eaten by humans , are required to go through animal testing by food safety authorities in many countries .
Enlarge By Paul Drinkwater , AP Nadya Suleman , left , speaking with Ann Curry in New York on Feb. 5 in Suleman 's first interview since giving birth to octuplets .
LOS ANGELES ( AP ) 
Long before she gave birth to her octuplets , Nadya Suleman delivered for her fertility specialist .
Like clockwork , she had babies every year but one between 2001 and 2006 .
The six children she had during that period accounted for a big share of the success stories at Dr. Michael Kamrava 's clinic .
And Kamrava touted his feats with Suleman on the local news .
MORE : Most fertility clinics break rules OUTCRY : Octuplets ' mother faces public backlash Q&A : Octuplet birth raises questions
But that track record — together with the birth of the octuplets on Jan. 26 — has raised eyebrows among doctors and ethicists who wonder whether Kamrava disregarded professional standards and used Suleman to boost his stats and improve his standing in the highly competitive and lucrative fertility field .
" A motivation would be improving his rate of live births , " said Alex Capron , a professor and bioethicist at the University of Southern California .
" If she was already a huge percentage of them , he may have felt ' Implant six , get three .
That 's three more in my plus column . '
" And for him , that would be a noticeable percentage .
That would help to explain his behavior . "
Kamrava , 57 , has not returned repeated calls from The Associated Press seeking comment .
Suleman , a 33 - year - old unemployed single mother , has said Kamrava implanted her with six embryos for each of her six pregnancies — an apparent violation of national guidelines that specify no more than two embryos for a healthy woman under 35 .
In her last pregnancy , two of the six embryos split to create eight babies .
Reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that between 2000 and 2006 , Suleman 's children accounted for five out of 24 live births to women under 35 who underwent the same procedure at Kamrava 's clinic .
( She had six children in all during that period , including a set of twins , which are counted as one live birth in CDC data . )
The figures do not include 2005 , when Kamrava did not file with the CDC .
During that same period , no more than one in five fertility cycles at Kamrava 's clinic in any given year resulted in a live birth for women under 35 using fresh embryos and their own eggs .
The national average for U.S. fertility clinics in 2006 , the most recent year reported , was about 30 % .
In 2006 , when Suleman was pregnant with the twins , she was featured with Kamrava in a KTLA - TV news story about an embryo implantation procedure he pioneered that he claimed could boost pregnancy rates by 70 % .
The controversial technique buries the embryos in the uterine lining .
A high success rate could turn heads in the highly competitive field , where doctors keep close tabs on their standings in clinic - by - clinic statistics .
That pressure is magnified in the Los Angeles metropolitan area , where there are many high - volume clinics , said Dr. Hal Danzer , of the Southern California Reproductive Center .
" You look at what everybody else is doing across the country and if everybody is doing better than you do , you start looking at your lab , " Danzer said .
The field is also lucrative :
In vitro fertilizations can cost up to $ 15,000 per cycle , and many patients undergo multiple cycles .
Some fertility doctors said they doubt Kamrava , a 25 - year veteran in the field , would attempt to plump up his overall statistics with one patient .
" That 's a real stretch , " said Dr. Jeffrey Steinberg , medical director of Fertility Institutes , with locations in Los Angeles , New York and Mexico .
" I 've known him for a long time , and that 's not the impression I get . "
He also noted that fertility specialists come under pressure from their patients .
" We 've all had this , we all talk about it .
You 've got four embryos sitting in the dish , you want to give her two and she wants all four , " ' he said .
" You 're damned if you do and you 're damned if you do n't . "
By Suleman 's own account , that may have happened in her case .
Suleman was in her early 20s and had had several failed pregnancies when she first underwent in vitro fertilization with Kamrava in 2000 .
On the first try with Kamrava , Suleman became pregnant and gave birth to a son in 2001 .
Thirteen months later , she delivered a daughter and went back for a third try a few months later , she said .
" At that point , the doctor 's like ' You 're the only person who 's come back more than twice , " ' she said on NBC's " Today . "
Suleman said she was able to persuade her doctor to implant more embryos because " he knew I wanted a big family and this is my only option . "

The Evolution of Eevee “ A rare Pokemon that adapts to harsh environments by taking on different evolutionary forms .
” Introduction : One of the most unique standard Pokemon is Eevee , one little pokemon that evolves into 7 completely different forms .
The different forms see different degrees of usage throughout the meta - game , spread across virtually all the tiers ( excepting Ubers ) .
While Eevee is my favorite for its form , elegance and versatility , it comes at the cost of some of the more intricate evolutions in the game .
Eevee evolves through three different means : Stone , Happiness in relation to time of day and Location .
Not everyone understands how to evolve Eevee into its various forms because of this .
This guide is help people not only evolve their Eevee into the form they desire , but to understand the basics of each of the forms and some tips about effectively battling with each .
I will also include as flexible a possible breeding chain to help you get started with some of the move intricate move sets for Eevee , for those interested in something more than the stock Eevee Move Pool .
Evolution Quick Reference : The Basic Form , any egg from any evolution of Eevee will be this one .
First acquired from Bebe in the house to the right of the Poke Center in Hearthome City .
Psychic form - Evolves into this form from max happiness during the day - time ( between 4 am and 8 pm game time ) .
Fire form - Use a Fire stone on an Eevee .
Ice form - Have Eevee gain a level on Route 217 .
Electric form - Use a Thunder Stone on an Eevee .
Grass form - Have Eevee gain a level in Eterna ForestDark Form - Evolves into this form from max happiness during the night - time ( between 8 pm and 4 am game time ) .
Water Form - Use a Water Stone on an Eevee .
Platinum Update : it took some time to get all the info I wanted to include into this particular update as well as have a chance to try out the different moves that were added onto each of the Evolutions .
The Eevee-lution overall got some improvements with the shift into Platinum .
This guide now includes a Platinum Section for each Evolution , adding in the one move and telling you what moves it can learn from the Move Tutors .
Eevee :
As Eevee is the basic form of the Eevee species and the most fragile of them all , we ’ll start here .
Still , in terms of moves , it learns things that any of the forms can use and are frequently used in numerous strategies .
This form is rarely to never seen in the competitive battle environment save for baby games and even then it ’s likely to get passed up .
Still , it ’s a good pokemon to use to avoid encounters when it possesses the Run Away ability .
If someone was to use Eevee combatively , I ’d recommend the Adaptability ability as it boost Eevee ’s Normal type attacks also run away is useless in the competitive arena .
With some breed , it ’s possible to pass along specific moves and have a very versatile status pokemonEevee ’s Uses :
Of all the moves , I ’ve personally found the most use for Baton Pass .
In an Eevee- lution team , it ’s important that the Pokemon can support one another and this is the perfect move for that .
Baton Pass allows a Pokemon to pass on its stat - boosts .
This can make even the most frail of the Eevee forms a serious force to be reckoned with .
Still careful breeding adds much more functionality and improves the Eevee ’s ability to survive like Wish .
Several other of the Egg moves are very useful as well and should n’t be overlooked .

Eevee itself did not get much in terms of upgrades in Platinum .
It still learns all the same moves , though now having slightly expanded access to 5 different moves through the Move Tutors , though 2 it learns all on its own .
Platinum Move TutorsMud -Slap , Snore , Helping Hand , Last Resort , SwiftEgg Moves : Charm , Covet , Curse , Endure , Fake Tears , Flail , Tickle , Wish , YawnEevee Breeding : Eevee is a member of the “ ground ” egg group .
This means that it can only be bred with other Pokemon from the same egg group .
This is a quick guide , meant to allow you to breed in one of the moves per .
Some of these combinations allow , with only a little more effort , the inclusion of multiple egg moves .
Use these as a starting place to figure out your own combinations of moves that Eevee can know .
I aimed to show single to two generation breeding in all cases .
A good , quick way to get the Eevee you ’re looking for en mass is to have 2 Eevee of opposite genders that know the same moves from their standard set .
By breeding them together , the offspring will know the moves that BOTH the parents share .
This is a great way to get a lvl .
1 Eevee that knows Baton Pass or any other move .
Charm sharply drops your opponents attack .
Useful on Wall / Tank style to cripple physical sweepers and attackers .
Very rare to see this move used though .
Pichu ( starts with it ) ->
Pikachu +
EeveeCovet offers a way to quick steal in the middle of battle .
With some Pokemon this can make a huge difference in the outcome of the battle .
The user must be EMPTY HANDED to use this move and get the item .
Skitty ( lvl. 32 ) + EeveeCurse is a very powerful move on slow physical attacks ( like Flareon and Umbreon ) .
At the expense of speed , you boost your physical attack .
Several builds of Umbreon run this move .
Torkoal ( lvl. 12 ) + EeveeEndure is a must for the pokemon you want to just soak hits and are regularly facing dangerous threats .
As it ensures you will survive with One HP , it can be very useful .
Male Bunery ( lvl. 6 ) + EeveeFake
Tears is a great move to have in the wings for some of the Eevee forms .
Most of them , with a few exceptions , depend on their Special Attack stat and this move can help against annoying Wallish Blissey and others of its kin .
Male Plusle ( lvl. 21 ) / Minun( lvl. 31 ) + Pikachu >
Pi( ka ) chu +
EeveeFlail is an interesting move that increases its power as the user has less HP .
Very useful on ones with Endure or just a tendency to remain standing after taking a hard hit .
It ’s a risky move , but on a fast Pokemon , it can be a sound final attack .
All parents that can learn Flail learn it at 50 + , so it may take a while to get it .
Torkoal ( lvl. 52 ) + EeveeTickle is something that can help a situation with enough time .
It drops both Attack and Defense .
This is an impractical move perhaps , but someone might have a use for it .
Aipom ( lvl. 15 ) + EeveeWish heals the Pokemon for half its max HP the turn after it ’s used .
Any tanking , wall or support style Eevee will want this move on their list both for themselves and for their team - mates .
MALE Togetic ( lvl. 28 ) + Female Pikachu ->
Male Pi( ka ) chu +
EeveeYawn is a wonderful attack to have .
It makes a Pokemon drowsy at its use ( no effect ) but the next turn the Pokemon falls asleep .
A very useful attack that should n’t be underestimated in terms of its applications ( like giving Leafeon a chance to Swords Dance ) Bidoof ( lvl. 25 ) + Eevee
“ It ’s fur has the look and feel of velvet .
The orb on its forehead glows when it uses psycho-power .
” In - battle : If inflicted with Poison , Paralyze or Burn , inflicts the same status on the opponentOut of battle : Increases chance of random encounter with Pokemon of the same nature as the lead .
Eevee only evolves into Espeon during the ONLY during the DAYTIME .
This is a happiness based evolution , so be prepared to take some time with it .
This Psychic type offers a lot in terms of both support and ability .
While not the fastest Eevee evolution , it ’s second fastest .
Espeon aims to strike first and strike hard generally .
It possesses some healing ability with the bred - in Wish or naturally with Morning Sun at lvl .
71 .
Wish is the more useful of the two as it can be passed to a team - mate and is unaffected by weather conditions but takes a turn to activate .
Spec’ed through EV ’s for defense , this makes an okay special wall that has the ability to Baton Pass Stat boost , but its hit points have something to be desired in that regard .

Espeon saw some interesting shifts in its move pool thanks to the Tutors mostly .
The addition of Power Swap is nice , but not the most useful thing in the world , since it depends on your opponent , which counts heavily on prediction .
The addition of Signal Beam gives it something to use against other Psychic types and Dark types as well .

“ It has a flame sac in its body .
Its body temperature tops 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit before battle ” .
Prevents damage from Fire - type attacks and increases user ’s Fire - type attack strength by 50 % .
As Flareon is one of the original 3
Eevee evolutions so it ’s very easy to get with just a Fire Stone from the walls in the Undergound .
This kind of Eevee is one of the few that excel at Physical attacks .
It also can make a surprisingly good Special Wall , as its Special Defense is frequently passed up in favor of its attack abilities .
This is a form where Baton Passing is n’t as recommended as there are a number of other forms which can offer a bit more , but it ’s a good end to a Baton Pass chain .
Still , as it ’s decently durable its very feasible for this feisty Pokemon to pass on Wish without much risk .
Fire Fang is the only physical fire - type move it can learn , which proves to be very troublesome as it lacks strong Special Attack to back up most Fire - type moves .
Still , packing Return with a Choice Band or Life Orb makes this fellow a serious threat .
While a good Pokemon , it takes forethought , planning and some prediction to really bring this fellow in right .

“ Inhaled air is heated in the flame sac in its body to an intense fire over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit ” .
With the modified moveset , Flareon has gained some Special - Type moves of interest .
Superpower works from its awesome physical attack stat while Lava Plume finally is a solid special - type move .
Another is Heat Wave , though it is powerful , it drops the Special Attack stat , so it is a move to use sparingly .
Platinum:78 – Lava PlumePlatinum Move Tutor : Mud-Slap , Superpower , Snore , Helping Hand , Last Resort , Heat Wave , Swift
“ As a protective technique , it can completely freeze its fur to make its hair stand like needles ” .
Glaceon is a new comer to the scene of Pokemon and a Location Based evolution for Eevee .
Because of its typing or appearance it is sometimes called Iceon / Iceion etc .
The Ice Covered Rock is located on Route 217 , just above the last “ warming hut ” .
Just a Rare Candy or some fights to get the Eevee to level up on that route is all it takes to get this Pokemon .
This form packs a lot in terms of Special Attacks but unfortunately lacks a lot in terms of physical stats to take advantage of its few physical attacks .
The most common set - up on this Pokemon has Hail and Blizzard ( as Hail gives Blizzard perfect accuracy ) and Bright Powder ( to maximize its dodge chance with its Snow Cloak ability ) .
This form also has something in terms of both physical and special defense , making it an alright choice ( because of its Hit Points ) for Walling and passing the boost from Curse to something else .
Discretion should be exercised using Hail as NONE of the other Eevee forms are immune to its damaging effects and it can interfere with some other potential builds .

“ By controlling its body heat , it can freeze the atmosphere around it to make a diamond - dust flurry ” .
Glaceon did n’t see much of a shift in Platinum .
The addition of Barrier allows it boost its acceptable physical defense as well as Baton Pass it to another member of the team .
There are very minimal shifts in the builds of Glaceon which , excepting that it fell a tier in usage from Under - Used to Never - Used .

Jolteon is the 8th Fastest Pokemon in the game ( 6th if you condense the Deoxys Forms ) with a base speed of 130 and an Eevee to boot .
It is easily obtained by using a Thunderstone on Eevee at any point .
This form offers a few options , as this form ’s speed opens a lot of doors .
It ’s renowned for its Substitute or Stat - boost and Baton Pass combination as well as it makes for an excellent sweeper because of its high Speed and Special stats .
With just some support this fellow is very deadly .
Charge Beam mixed with a Wide Lens ( to counter the lower accuracy ) allows for Jolteon to build up its Special Attack more and pass the boosts to another team - member .
It ’s also possible to use this Pokemon to inflict status problems on your opponent ; it all depends on the needs of your team ’s needs .

“ If agitated , it uses electricity to straighten out its fur and launch it in small bunches ” .
All in all , Jolteon had a solid set of moves and platinum did not change much about how Jolteon is presently being used .
Still , the addition of Magnet Rise , a move which temporarily removes the serious ground weakness ( for 5 turns ) as well as the addition of Signal Beam , for some added fun .

The second of the location based evolutions of the new generation of Pokemon .
It ’s easiest to get a Leafeon by entering the Eterna Forest on the Floaroma and going North then West .
Leafeon presents the best physical attack and defense options .
Just as a Grass type it will encounter a lot of problems as many strong physical and special attacks are Fire typed ( be it the Pokemon or the move ) .
Still , it ’s got speed , some durability and a good attack stat .
Leafeon also gets some good moves as a grass type , as it can use Grass Whistle , Swords Dance up , then attack with Leaf Blade .
Still , while there are good special attack options , Leafeon does n’t have the raw power to fully utilize the potential of the moves .
To use Special moves , it ’d be recommended to have good Individual Values , a beneficial nature AND the appropriate item .651101306065951 – Tackle , Tail Whip , Helping Hand8 – Sand Attack15 – Razor Leaf22 – Quick Attack29 – Synthesis36 – Magical Leaf43 – Giga Drain50 – Last Resort57 – Grasswhistle64 – Sunny Day71 – Leaf Blade
“ It basically does not fight .
With cells similar to those of plants , it can perform photosynthesis ” .
It was great to see the most common move in Leafeon ’s build be incorporated into its standard moveset , saving everyone the TM to put it on there .
The addition of Seed Bomb is useful as well , giving another attack aside from Leaf Blade , which can be slightly faster to access at the expense of some power .
Fury Cutter is also an interesting addition , given time ( and boosting ) , this is easily the most powerful move that Leafeon can access .
Still , at 95 % accuracy , it is something that would require some playing around with and a lot of luck to really take advantage of .

The second Friendship based evolution of the Eevee .
Simply have the Eevee evolve in the night time to get this form when it loves you .
This form is renowned for its ability to just tank hits .
It has the Hit points and defenses as well as a good type for this .
It also has a rare combination of Mean Look and Baton Pass among many other moves .
This is a defensive Pokemon no matter how you look at it .
To change to an offensive style , moves like Payback , Pursuit and other condition based attacks are best .
The use of Curse is also recommended as Umbreon is n’t very fast to begin with and its got the raw potential to just take a beating , especially with either Moonlight or Wish.956511065130651 – Tackle , Tail Whip , Helping Hand8 – Sand Attack15 – Pursuit22 – Quick Attack29 – Confuse Ray36 – Faint Attack43 – Assurance50 – Last Resort57 – Mean Look64 – Screech71 – Moonlight
“ When exposed to the moon ’s aura , the rings on its body glow faintly and it gains a mysterious power ” .
It is a little surprising to see Sucker Punch added onto Umbreon 's move list , as most times Umbreon is used defensively , with a few exceptions .
Still , the addition of Guard Swap offers something slightly different .
Still , Umbreon did not really benefit much from these changes into Platinum .
Platinum:78 - Guard SwapPlatinum Move Tutors : Mud-Slap , Snore , Spite , Helping Hand , Last Resort , Sucker Punch , Swift
“ It has evolved to be suitable for an aquatic life .
It can invisibly melt away into water ” .
Restores Pokemon ’s HP 25 % when hit by a water - type attack .
Just as Umbreon is a wall , Vaporeon is the sponge of the family .
To get a Vaporeon , all you need to do is use a Water Stone on Eevee .
While it only has notable defenses , it has the Hit Points to soak most hits and still be standing , including un - boosted Super Effective hits .
Vaporeon ’s HP is its main point and most will max it out , but it ’s important to remember a bit about its Special Attack as it is the second highest statistic .
While both are note worthy the best results will come from choosing to either have Vaporeon Defensively EV’ed ( HP , Sp. D / Def ) or Offensively oriented ( Sp. A , HP , Choice defense ) .
It seems like a good idea to balance it out , but Vaporeon ’s resilience comes mostly from its massive HP pool ( mine is n’t max and it ’s still got over 400 HP ) .
A different set of options for Vaporeon would be buffing with Acid Armor and Baton Pass or as a Hazer , eliminating stat - boosts .
Hit Points will always be worth investing in for this Pokemon as they are its greatest strength .

“ Its cell composition is similar to water molecules .
As a result , it can melt away into water ” .
There are cases I honestly wonder how some moves get chosen .
Dive is n’t too good for Vaporeon , as it has stronger Special stats .
Still , Muddy Water is a good addition for a more status oriented Vaporeon ( or one playing around with a fully supporting team ) .
Again , Signal Beam would add a fair bit with the Move-sets .

… pigs would fly , I know , but if McConnell had any sense of decency he would do the following :
Vote for the stimulus package in the Senate .
Why ?
So that his colleague , Sherrod Brown , would not have to leave his mother ’s wake ( say that again , in all caps : HIS MOTHER ’S WAKE ) in Ohio , fly to DC , cast his vote , and then fly back to Ohio in time for his mother ’s funeral ( say that again , in all caps : HIS MOTHER’S FUNERAL ) tomorrow .
I mean , there is no doubt that the bill will pass .
There is no question that Brown ’s vote will be the needed 60th to ensure passage .
The only other option , the only other vote to provide the margin of those who voted at the last , procedural hurdle is Ted Kennedy , and he ’s dealing with brain cancer ( caps again : BRAIN CANCER ) , so it falls to Brown , trying to bury his mother , or some one Republican with a sense of decency sufficiently developed to switch his or her vote in Brown ’s stead .
And what gravels me is that there would be no political price to be paid for such a switch — in fact , it would have only benefits for the brave senator to do so , and for his or her party .
It could be made clear that this is purely a gesture , not of bipartisanship , but of sympathy and support for a co-worker dealing with a terribly rough time .
No one would accuse McConnell of betraying his principles ( he has some -?- ed. ) ( shhh–tl ) were he to so vote .
He could state very clearly what he was doing and why , ( and send some sympathy Brown ’s way ) .
He could be seen , for just a moment , as human being rather than a partisan hack .
Nothing but good could acrue to him here .
And I ca n’t believe there would be any electoral fall out that would follow what would be clearly understood by all as a classy gesture .
McConnell — or Gregg , or any of a number of Republicans of impeccable ( sic ) right wing ideological pedigree — would be able to demonstrate a kind of reasonableness that the rest of their recent actions hide pretty well .
Even better : they would be praised for the kind of gesture that the GOP has found it impossible to make in response to what polls show is a pretty effective campaign to suggest that they are refusing the proffered hand of a very popular president .
Plus , of course , its just the right thing to do , the sort of care you take for those with whom you work — even the ones with whom you disagree , who you may in fact dislike — just because it makes the world a slightly better place in a way that costs nothing .
Your mama told you to do such things ; I and my wife work on my eight year old all the time to get him to internalize the notion that kindness is the default option in his dealings with the world .
Is this so hard to get ?
To do ?
If you are a Senate Republican , I guess so .
I can’t even get angry about this one .
It ’s just sad .
These are damaged people .
Update : Hello to all dropping in from Balloon Juice — and thanks much to John Cole for the connection made .
Update 2 : And to all of you dropping in from Grasping Reality … my thanks as well to Brad Delong for his notice of this quantum of rage .

WASHINGTON — Several leading congressional Demo-crats complained Thursday that President Barack Obama ’s troop withdrawal plan would leave behind too many U.S. forces in Iraq , exposing a fault line between the White House and its Capitol Hill allies .
As Obama prepared to fly to Camp Lejeune , N.C. , today to announce his decision , legislative leaders signaled skepticism about the prospect of keeping a residual force of as many as 50,000 troops in Iraq beyond summer 2010 .
The leftover units would focus on training Iraqi security forces , hunting down terrorists and protecting U.S. installations .
“ I have been one for a long time who has called for significant cutbacks in Iraq , ” Sen . Harry Reid , a Nevada Demo-crat and the Senate majority leader , told reporters before heading to the White House for a briefing .
“ I ’m happy to listen to the secretary of defense and the president , but when they talk about 50,000 , that ’s a little higher number than I anticipated . ”
Obama consistently said during the presidential campaign that he would leave some forces even after he withdrew all combat brigades .
The plan he intends to unveil today will withdraw at least 90,000 of the 142,000 troops in Iraq by August 2010 .
That would be about 19 months from his inauguration , or three months longer than the time frame he outlined as a candidate .
Sensitive to criticism , the administration plans to call the remaining troops a “ transition force ” rather than a “ residual ” one .
The White House declined to respond directly to Democratic criticisms before Obama ’s speech .
“ The president asked his — the national security team — to put together a plan that they and he believed would accomplish the goal of removing our combat forces from Iraq in the most responsible way , ” said Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary .
Sen . Jack Reed , a Rhode Island Democrat who accompanied Obama to Iraq last summer , said a remainder force of 50,000 was appropriate .
“ It seems logical to me you would need a force of around that level , ” he said in an interview .
“ The critical issue here is the missions that these troops are going to perform . ”
Democratic criticism began Wednesday when Rep. Nancy Pelosi , of California , the House speaker , said she did not understand “ the justification ” for 50,000 troops .
Others echoed her language on Thursday .
Scientists have assembled the highest - resolution image yet of the protein sheath that surrounds viral DNA , accurate right down to the last of its five million atoms .
Called a capsid , the sheath protects viral DNA from cellular defense mechanisms .
If scientists can crack it , they might have a clear shot at the virus — and now they know what it looks like .
The image , published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , was made from hundreds of crystallographic x-rays , each providing a multi-layered picture of the capsid 's structure .
Combined , they formed a fully three - dimensional image .
With it , researchers were able to show the capsid 's composition from repeating copies of a single four - protein block .
Earlier studies had identified the protein , but not its precise arrangement .
The researchers used a capsid belonging to Penicillium stoloniferum , a virus that infects the fungus that makes penicillin , but the findings may be applicable to the several hundred viruses that share its spherical capsid shape .
Other viruses have helical capsids ; images still need to be assembled for them , but the same imaging techniques may be applied .

( OPRAH .COM ) --
For years Laure Redmond hated her body : too fat , too freckled , too lumpy , too stumpy .
And that hatred was like a set of shackles holding her back from life .
Author says she finds that women comfortable with their own body are nicer to other women .
Now a self - esteem coach who specializes in mind / body issues , Redmond has made a career of helping women and teenage girls get over what she calls their body demons .
Her goal for them is summed up in the title of her 2001 book : " Feel Good Naked . "
It 's not about naked for naked 's sake , she says it 's about the amazing confidence that comes with being at ease in your own skin .
DEBORAH WAY : Let 's be clear here :
You 're not advocating some kind of nudist revolution , correct ?
LAURE REDMOND : ( Laughs )
No , streaking is not going to make a comeback as a result of my message .
I just want women to feel good about their bodies so they can feel good about themselves -- because when a woman feels good naked , it shows .
She has an allure that comes through in the way she moves or talks or laughs .
Her confidence is n't rooted in her clothing size or facial features but in her attitude -- fun , delightful , free .
WAY : That sounds fabulous .
REDMOND : Yes , but it 's not easy .
For lots of women , even the word " naked " brings huge discomfort .
I was volunteering at my child 's school once when another mother , who had heard I was an author , asked me the title of my book .
When I told her , she set down the envelopes she 'd been stuffing , grabbed her purse , and left the building without saying another word .

The self - esteem repair kit
WAY : Did that surprise you ?
REDMOND : Unfortunately , no .
I 'm no longer shocked by negative reactions to the idea of nakedness .
I call it naked fear .
We button up .
We shut ourselves down .
We have an overwhelming paranoia about fat .
We can't be free with our forms .
Oprah.com : 9 ways to work your curves
WAY : Getting over our horror of our bodies must make things better in the bedroom .
REDMOND : Oh , yes .
What 's sexy in the bedroom is when you love your stuff , when you want to share it with your partner .
But that 's really just a bonus -- it 's much broader than that .
Being comfortable naked is the ultimate expression of self - confidence .
If you 're okay with being nude , you can take yourself anywhere in the world .
WAY : Where do you start ?
REDMOND : Often , at the beginning .
I do n't mean that facetiously .
I mean that it can be really helpful to reconnect to a time when you were n't always blaming yourself -- when you believed in and loved yourself .
And for many women , that time will turn out to be back in childhood .
WAY : You 're speaking from experience ?
REDMOND : Yes .
I was a chubby , freckle - faced little girl with frizzy auburn hair -- far from the visual ideal of 1970s New Orleans , where I grew up and where thin , blonde cheerleaders ruled .
But I had spirit -- I was a firecracker -- and a photograph I keep on my desk reminds me of that .
I 'm sitting cross-legged in our front yard , in shorts and a cropped top that were surely not a chubby girl 's best outfit .
Yet I look self - possessed , even somewhat certain that on that particular day at least , I was beautiful -- a femme fatale at the tender age of 6 .
The picture reminds me of the little girl who could , even when not much else around her supported such a healthy vision of herself .
WAY : What about someone who had an abusive or otherwise truly horrible childhood ?
REDMOND : Even if your childhood was a total nightmare , the fact is you were a creature with enough gusto to get where you are today .
Many women accept the opinions and judgments of others too quickly , which undermines self - esteem and personal power .
But women who feel good naked have the ability to tap into their own source of self - love , without depending on the affirmations of others .
A woman who feels good naked is a woman who 's discovered her own definition of beauty .
She knows that it 's ultimately about personal attitude .
WAY : No doubt a lot of women would agree with that -- so long as you were n't talking about them .
We can see beauty in others who are n't gorgeous in the conventional sense , but we 're resolutely blind to it in ourselves .
REDMOND : That 's because of our punishing culture .
Men are rewarded for their bottom line ; women , for their visuals .
Our society is driven by an unrealistic ideal of physical beauty :
More than 60 percent of American women are a size 12 or larger , yet we 're bombarded by images of size 0s , which can fuel a barrage of insecurity and self - doubt .
Women from other countries have far healthier attitudes about the female form .
I was in Puerto Rico recently with my husband , who rarely comments on other women 's looks , and he was marveling at the number of beautiful Puerto Rican women on the beach -- women who by American standards would have been considered fat .
I agreed with him .
WAY : How do you get away from those standards ?
REDMOND : For one thing , turn off the TV -- especially if you find yourself biting your nails or eating a pint of ice cream while watching .
Why spend the evening with actresses who remind you of what you visually are n't ?
Better to take a yoga class , sit down with a good book , or -- and this is my personal favorite -- watch a video of Tina Turner .
WAY : Why Tina Turner ?
REDMOND : She was the source of my greatest body epiphany .
I saw her perform in New York City in the late 1980s .
She wore a black leather minidress and four - inch platform shoes , and watching her dance , I was transfixed .
And then she stopped her electric gyrations , and I realized how substantial her legs were .
They are bold and glorious , and she 's turned them into art .
WAY : We can't all move like Tina , though ...
REDMOND : No , but women who feel good naked approach life with that same spirit of boldness , that same use - it - or - lose - it zest .
And by the way , that spirit is very sexy .
I know a professor in his 50s who 's been single much of his adult life and who 's had relationships -- or at least relations -- with many women , some in their early 20s .
At a dinner party recently , he told me that sex with a woman over 40 is way more pleasurable and satisfying than sex with a younger woman -- because a woman with the joie de vivre that comes from having a bank of life experiences is a much bigger turn - on than a youthful body .
WAY : That 's good to know .
REDMOND : I was delighted -- especially because part of my message is that the feel - good - naked lifestyle involves living with a sense of adventure .
Eleanor Roosevelt was onto something when she said , " Do one thing every day that scares you . "
It does n't have to be anything earth - shattering .
I can't tell you how many of my former beets - or Brussels sprouts -- hating friends have become converts in their 40s .
WAY : And what has that done for them beyond broadening their options in the produce section ?
REDMOND : Eating is the most primal thing we do , and the way we do it inevitably carries over into other parts of our lives .
It 's the great metaphor .
If you 're going to try Brussels sprouts , you might be more likely to climb a mountain the next time you 're on vacation .
It 's about breaking out of the fear zone .
You 're training yourself to move away from the world of " can't , " " do n't , " " wo n't . "
WAY : So women who feel good naked are adventurous eaters ?
REDMOND : Adventurous , purposeful , and aware .
I often hear women say they eat with blind abandon in an effort to avoid unpleasant feelings .
Yet mindless eating will not eliminate these feelings .
In fact , it compounds them , since in addition to carrying your mental pain , you wo n't be able to manage your weight effectively .
Changing this destructive pattern means finding a balanced , sensible approach to eating that can become permanent because it 's satisfying and sustainable .
WAY : The holy grail .
REDMOND : Yes .
I 'm still amazed by how many women let themselves be ruled by eating disorders -- not anorexia or bulimia , but things like cutting out whole food groups or routinely skipping entire meals .
Women try to avoid accountability with eating ; they tend to believe in the magical thinking of random restriction .
But this means their lives are directed by deprivation .
No wonder we 're obsessive and compulsive about food .
On the other hand , when you eat with purpose and awareness , it 's such a relief .
You 're happier , calmer , not constantly bitchy or tense .
Suddenly you can enjoy social outings more , you can be more conscious of your interactions with other people .
WAY : When it comes to food , then , we need to back off the crazy rules we make for ourselves .
Be a little kinder to ourselves .
REDMOND : Absolutely .
And " kindness " is a good word , because it brings up another characteristic of women who feel good naked :
They 're kind to other women .
WAY : In what way ?
REDMOND :
They can genuinely take pleasure in other women 's success , happiness -- and beauty .
Just the other night I was eating dinner with a group of women who were speaking about another woman in our community , an attractive woman , in such a mean - spirited way that I had to excuse myself from the table .
The source of that mean - spiritedness was clearly the woman 's physical appearance .
WAY : Because when you 're miserable with your own body , you 've doomed yourself to " compare and despair . "
REDMOND : It 's the distorted sense that looks are everything .
And women who view each other this way do a disservice to us all .
When my sister and her husband were in the process of separating , at least two acquaintances reacted by telling her , in disbelief , " But you 're skinny ! " -- as if her physique should have cushioned her from heartache .
If you have friends who base everything on their own and other people 's appearances , ask yourself what you 're getting out of the relationship .
If it 's mostly stress , it 's time to find different friends .
WAY : Have you found that women are judged more harshly by each other than they are by men ?
Laure : Yes .
And there 's this , as well : I grew up in a houseful of women and now I 'm growing older in a houseful of men , and I 'm here to tell you that teenage boys might just be the vainest creatures on earth .
They 're every bit as freaked out by their pimples , bad hair , and extra weight as girls are .
It does n't stop when they leave adolescence , either .
We all know what bald men go through , and new research from Harvard University 's McLean Hospital reports that up to 25 percent of adults with eating disorders are male .
So the next time you start worrying that the man in your life is going to judge you , remember that he has insecurities of his own .
And he 'd probably love to feel good naked too .

But now these pay - as - you - go phones are winning over fans for different reasons — recession - battered consumers are buying them as a way to cut costs and avoid the lengthy contracts and occasional billing surprises that come with traditional cellphone plans .
“ Frugal is the new chic , ” said Joy Miller , 33 , a piano teacher in Aubrey , Tex .
After almost a decade on contract plans with Verizon Wireless , Mrs. Miller and her husband decided this month to test - drive a few prepaid plans , including MetroPCS .
“ In today ’s economy , it ’s not cool to pay $ 120 a month for a phone .
It ’s a waste of money . ”
Although prepaid phones remain a fraction of the overall mobile phone market , sales of the category grew 13 percent in North America last year , nearly three times faster than traditional cellphone plans , according to Pali Research , an investment advisory firm .
For the first time in its history , T - Mobile has been signing up more new prepaid customers than traditional ones .
And Sprint Nextel is betting that a new flat - rate prepaid plan will help it wring more value from its struggling Nextel unit .

The UN Climate Conference in Poznan , Poland , starting today is raising hopes and fears across the green spectrum .
As reported in the Christian Science Monitor .
A year - long push to devise a new global climate - change treaty – one that picks up where the Kyoto Protocol leaves off – gets under way Monday in Poland , with delegates from more than 190 nations set to resume grappling with the thorny issues of how much more to cut greenhouse - gas emissions and who will pay .
The talks , in their first round , are focused on reducing human influence on climate from occurring , according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .
More or less , this means keeping global warming to about 2 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels by the end of the century .
Expectations however are low for this meeting .
President - Elect Obama ’s pledge to reduce greenhouse gases to pre 1990 levels in the next 12 years notwithstanding , this group has a lot of challenges ahead .
This first round of talks is primarily to develop working groups to tackle the various issues surrounding climate change in both developed and developing countries .
But , with the global economic crisis on everyone ’s mind , it will be hard to keep the conversation on track and work toward lower carbon emissions .
And while they are working to devise ways to reduce carbon emissions , they ’ll create quite a few .
AFP reports :
Around 13,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) will be added to the Earth ’s greenhouse effect from the December 1 - 12 meeting of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change , the UNFCCC said .
That estimate is based on a turnout of 8,000 people , but as of Sunday 10,657 people had registered for the talks .
Fortunately , the Polish government plans to purchase credits to offset the total emissions generated which are mostly from travel and heating and lighting the conference areas .
Would n’t a Webinar have been more carbon neutral ?

Could computers based on Intel 's Atom processors , already popular among consumers , catch on for cash - strapped business ?
Dell seems to think so -- at least in some markets .
" We 're exploring that , and there is some potential , " said Steve Felice , president of Dell 's small and medium business group , during a conference call with reporters .
Dell is already offering Atom - based computers to business in some markets .
However , demand for Atom - based computers remains relatively small compared to demand for systems that use mainstream Intel processors , especially the low - end Celeron line , Felice said .
Atom - based laptops have been a rare bright spot for computer makers , which have taken a beating in recent months .
However , popular laptops like Asustek Computer 's Eee PC and Acer's Aspire
One are primarily aimed at consumers , not at businesses .
Dell , which was late responding to demand for Atom - powered computers , eventually released its own Atom laptops for consumers , as well as the Vostro A100 desktop , a business PC that runs Ubuntu Linux and uses Intel 's 1.6GHz Atom 230 processor .
The relative popularity of Dell 's Celeron - based desktops compared to the Atom systems may be partly due to availability .
For example , the Atom - based A100 does not appear for sale among a list of Vostro desktops offered for sale on Dell 's U.S. Web site , while Celeron - based systems are offered .
Performance does n't appear to be an issue for using Atom - based machines in an office environment .
While Intel executives frequently deride the inexpensive Atom processors for lacking the performance of their multi-core cousin , Dell 's Web site for Middle East sales said the chip " delivers the performance required for basic office computing . "
It may finally be 2009 , but in some ways , given these last years , it might as well be 800 BCE .
From the ninth to the seventh centuries BCE , the palace walls of the kings who ruled the Assyrian Empire were decorated with vast stone friezes , filled with enough dead bodies to sate any video - game maker and often depicting -- in almost comic strip - style -- various bloody royal victories and conquests .
At least one of them shows Assyrian soldiers lopping off the heads of defeated enemies and piling them into pyramids for an early version of what , in the VCE ( Vietnam Common Era ) of the 1960s , Americans came to know as the " body count . "
So I learned recently by wandering through a traveling exhibit of ancient Assyrian art from the British Museum .
On the audio tour accompanying the show , one expert pointed out that Assyrian scribes , part of an impressive imperial bureaucracy , carefully counted those heads and recorded the numbers for the greater glory of the king ( as , in earlier centuries , Egyptian scribes had recorded counts of severed hands for victorious Pharaohs ) .
Hand it to art museums .
Is there anything stranger than wandering through one and locking eyes with a Vermeer lady , a Van Eyck portrait , or one of Rembrandt 's burghers staring out at you across the centuries ?
What a reminder of the common humanity we share with the distant past .
In a darker sense , it 's no less a reminder of our kinship across time to spot a little pyramid of heads on a frieze , imagine an Assyrian scribe making his count , and -- eerily enough -- feel at home .
What a measure of just how few miles " the march of civilization " ( as my parents ' generation once called it ) has actually covered .
Prejudiced Toward War
If you need an epitaph for the Bush administration , here 's one to test out :
They tried .
They really tried .
But they could n't help it .
They just had to count .
In a sense , George W. Bush did the Assyrians proud .
With his secret prisons , his outsourced torture chambers , his officially approved kidnappings , the murders committed by his interrogators , the massacres committed by his troops and mercenaries , and the shock - and - awe slaughter he ordered from the air , it 's easy enough to imagine what those Assyrian scribes would have counted , had they somehow been teleported into his world .
True , his White House did n't have friezes of his victories ( one problem being that there were none to glorify ) ; all it had was Saddam Hussein 's captured pistol proudly stored in a small study off the Oval Office .
Almost 3,000 years later , however , Bush 's " scribes , " still traveling with the imperial forces , continued to count the bodies as they piled ever higher in Iraq , Afghanistan , the Pakistani borderlands , and elsewhere .
Many of those body counts were duly made public .
This record of American " success " was visible to anyone who visited the Pentagon 's website and viewed its upbeat news articles complete with enumerations of " Taliban fighters " or , in Iraq , " terrorists , " the Air Force 's news feed listing the number of bombs dropped on " anti-Afghan forces , " or the U.S. Central Command 's stories of killing " Taliban militants . "
On the other hand , history , as we know , does n't repeat itself and -- unlike the Assyrians -- the Bush administration would have preferred not to count , or at least not to make its body counts public .
One of its small but tellingly unsuccessful struggles , a sign of the depth of its failure on its own terms , was to avoid the release of those counts .
Its aversion to the body count made some sense .
After all , since the 1950s , body counting for the U.S. military has invariably signaled not impending victory , but disaster , and even defeat .
In fact , one of the strangest things about the American empire has been this : Between 1945 and George W. Bush 's second term , the U.S. economy , American corporations , and the dollar have held remarkable sway over much of the rest of the world .
New York City has been the planet 's financial capital and Washington its war capital .
( Moscow , even at the height of the Cold War , always came in a provincial second . )
In the same period , the U.S. military effectively garrisoned much of the globe from the Horn of Africa to Greenland , from South Korea to Qatar , while its Navy controlled the seven seas , its Air Force dominated the global skies , its nuclear command stood ready to unleash the powers of planetary death , and its space command watched the heavens .
In the wake of the Cold War , its various military commands ( including Northcom , set up by the Bush administration in 2002 , and Africom , set up in 2007 ) divided the greater part of the planet into what were essentially military satrapies .
And yet , the U.S. military , post - 1945 , simply could not win the wars that mattered .
Because the neocons of the Bush administration brushed aside this counterintuitive fact , they believed themselves faced in 2000 with an unparalleled opportunity ( whose frenetic exploitation would be triggered by the attacks of 9/11 , the " Pearl Harbor " of the new century ) .
With the highest - tech military on the planet , funded at levels no other set of nations could cumulatively match , the United States , they were convinced , was uniquely situated to give the phrase " sole superpower " historically unprecedented meaning .
Even the Assyrians at their height , the Romans in their Pax Romana centuries , the British in the endless decades when the sun could never set on its empire , would prove pikers by comparison .
In this sense , President Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , and the various neocons in the administration were fundamentalist idolaters -- and what they worshipped was the staggering power of the U.S. military .
They were believers in a church whose first tenet was the efficacy of force above all else .
Though few of them had the slightest military experience , they gave real meaning to the word bellicose .
They were prejudiced towards war .
With awesome military power at their command , they were also convinced that they could go it alone as the dominating force on the planet .
As with true believers everywhere , they had only contempt for those they could n't convert to their worldview .
That contempt made " unilateralism " their strategy of choice , and a global Pax Americana their goal ( along with , of course , a Pax Republicana at home ) .
If All Else Fails , Count the Bodies
It was in this context that they were not about to count the enemy dead .
In their wars , as these fervent , inside - the - Beltway utopians saw it , there would be no need to do so .
With the " shock and awe " forces at their command , they would refocus American attention on the real metric of victory , the taking of territory and of enemy capitals .
At the same time , they were preparing to disarm the only enemy that truly scared them , the American people , by making none of the mistakes of the Vietnam era , including -- as the President later admitted -- counting bodies .
Of course , both the Pax Americana and the Pax Republicana would prove will - o'- the - wisps .
As it turned out , the Bush administration , blind to the actual world it faced , disastrously miscalculated the nature of American power -- especially military power -- and what it was capable of doing .
And yet , had they taken a clear - eyed look at what American military power had actually achieved in action since 1945 , they might have been sobered .
In the major wars ( and even some minor actions ) the U.S. military fought in those decades , it had been massively destructive but never victorious , nor even particularly successful .
In many ways , in the classic phrase of Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong , it had been a " paper tiger . "
Yes , it had " won " largely meaningless victories -- in Operation Urgent Fury , the invasion of the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada in 1983 ; against the toothless Panamanian regime of Manuel Noriega in Operation Just Cause in 1989 ; in Operation Desert Storm , largely an air campaign against Saddam Hussein 's helpless military in 1990 ( in a war that settled nothing ) ; in NATO 's Operation Deliberate Force , an air war against the essentially defenseless Serbian military in 1995 ( while meeting disaster in operations in Iran in 1980 and Somalia in 1993 ) .
On the other hand , in Korea in the early 1950s and in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia from the 1960s into the early 1970s , it had committed its forces all but atomically , and yet had met nothing but stalemate , disaster , and defeat against enemies who , on paper at least , should not have been able to stand up to American power .
It was in the context of defeat and then frustration in Korea that the counting of enemy bodies began .
Once Chinese communist armies had entered that war in massive numbers in late 1950 and inflicted a terrible series of defeats on American forces but could not sweep them off the peninsula , that conflict settled into a " meatgrinder " of a stalemate in which the hope of taking significant territory faded ; yet some measure of success was needed as public frustration mounted in the United States : thus began the infamous body count of enemy dead .
The body count reappeared quite early in the Vietnam War , again as a shorthand way of measuring success in a conflict in which the taking of territory was almost meaningless , the countryside a hostile place , the enemy hard to distinguish from the general population , and our own in - country allies weak and largely unable to strengthen themselves .
Those tallies of dead bodies , announced daily by military spokesmen to increasingly dubious reporters in Saigon , were the public face of American " success " in the Vietnam era .
Each body was to be further evidence of what General William Westmoreland called " the light at the end of the tunnel . "
When those dead bodies and any sense of success began to part ways , however , when , in the terminology of the times , a " credibility gap " opened between the metrics of victory and reality , the body count morphed into a symbol of barbarism as well as of defeat .
It helped stoke an antiwar movement .

This was why , in choosing to take on Saddam Hussein 's hapless military in 2003 -- the administration was looking for a " cakewalk " campaign that would " shock and awe " enemies throughout the Middle East -- they officially chose not to release any counts of enemy dead .
General Tommy Franks , commander of the administration 's Afghan operation in 2001 and the invasion of Iraq thereafter , put the party line succinctly , " We do n't do body counts . "
As the President finally admitted in some frustration to a group of conservative columnists in October 2006 , his administration had " made a conscious effort not to be a body - count team . "
Not intending to repeat the 1960s experience , he and his advisors had planned out an opposites war on the home front -- anything done in Vietnam would not be done this time around -- and that meant not offering official counts of the dead which might stoke an antiwar movement ... until , as in Korea and Vietnam , frustration truly set in .
When the taking of Baghdad in April 2003 proved no more of a capstone on American victory than the taking of Kabul in November 2001 , when everything began to go disastrously wrong and the carefully enumerated count of the American dead in Iraq rose precipitously , when " victory " ( a word which the President still invoked 15 times in a single speech in November 2005 ) adamantly refused to make an appearance , the moment for the body count had arrived .
Despite all the planning , they just could n't stop themselves .
A frustrated President expressed it this way : " We do n't get to say that -- a thousand of the enemy killed , or whatever the number was .
It 's happening .
You just do n't know it . "
Soon enough the Pentagon was regularly releasing such figures in reports on its operations and , in December 2006 , the President , too , first slipped such a tally into a press briefing .
( " Our commanders report that the enemy has also suffered .
Offensive operations by Iraqi and coalition forces against terrorists and insurgents and death squad leaders have yielded positive results .
In the months of October , November , and the first week of December , we have killed or captured nearly 5,900 of the enemy . " )
It was n't , of course , that no one had been counting .
The President , as we know from Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward , had long been keeping " 'his own personal scorecard for the [ global ] war [ on terror ] ' in the form of photographs with brief biographies and personality sketches of those judged to be the world 's most dangerous terrorists -- each ready to be crossed out by the President as his forces took them down . "
And the military had been counting bodies as well , but as the possibility of victory disappeared into the charnel houses of Iraq and Afghanistan , the Pentagon and the president finally gave in .
While this did not stoke an antiwar movement , it represented a tacit admission of policy collapse , a kind of surrender .
It was as close as an administration which never owned up to error could come to admitting that two more disastrous wars had been added to a string of military failures in the truncated American Century .
That implicit admission , however , took years to arrive , and in the meantime , Iraqis and Afghans -- civilians , insurgents , terrorists , police , and military men -- were dying in prodigious numbers .
The Global War on Terror as a Ponzi Scheme
As it happened , others were also counting .
Among the earliest of them , a website , Iraq Body Count , carefully toted up Iraqi civilian deaths as documented in reputable media outlets .
Their estimate has , by now , almost reached 100,000 -- and , circumscribed by those words " documented " and " civilian , " does n't begin to get at the full scope of Iraqi deaths .
Various groups of scholars and pollsters also took up the task , using sophisticated sampling techniques ( including door - to - door interviews under exceedingly dangerous conditions ) to arrive at reasonable approximations of the Iraqi dead .
They have come up with figures ranging from the hundreds of thousands to a million or more in a country with a prewar population of perhaps 26 million .
United Nations representatives have similarly attempted , under difficult circumstances , to keep a count of Iraqis fleeing into exile -- exile being , after a fashion , a form of living death -- and have estimated that more than 2 million Iraqis fled their country , while another 2.7 million , having fled their homes , remained " internally displaced . "
Similar attempts have been made for Afghanistan .
Human Rights
Watch has , for instance , done its best to tally civilian deaths from air strikes in that country ( while even TomDispatch has attempted to keep a modest count of wedding parties obliterated by U.S. air attacks in Afghanistan and Iraq ) .
But , of course , the real body count in either country will never be known .
One thing is certain , however : it is an obscenity of the present moment that Iraq , still a charnel house , still in a state of near total disrepair , still on the edge of a whole host of potential conflicts , should increasingly be portrayed here as a limited Bush administration " surge " success .
Only a country -- or a punditry or a military -- incapable of facing the depths of destruction that the Bush administration let loose could reach such a conclusion .
If all roads once led to Rome , all acts of the Bush administration have led to destruction , and remarkably regularly to piles of dead or tortured bodies , counted or not .
In fact , it 's reasonable to say that every Bush administration foreign policy dream , including its first term fantasy about a pacified " Greater Middle East " and its late second term vision of a facilitated " peace process " between the Israelis and Palestinians , has ended in piles of bodies and in failure .
Consider this a count all its own .
Looked at another way , the Bush administration 's Global War on Terror and its subsidiary wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have , in effect , been a giant Ponzi scheme .
At a cost of nearly one trillion taxpayer dollars to date ( but sure to be in the multi- trillions when all is said and done ) , Bush 's mad " global war " simply sucked needed money out of our world at levels that made Bernie Madoff seem like a small fry .
Madoff , by his own accounting , squandered perhaps $ 50 billion of other people 's money .
The Bush administration took a trillion dollars of ours and handed it out to its crony corporate buddies and to the Pentagon as down payments on disaster -- and that 's without even figuring into the mix the staggering sums still needed to care for American soldiers maimed , impaired , or nearly destroyed by Bush 's wars .
With Bush 's " commander - in - chief " presidency only days from its end , the price tag on his " war " continues to soar as dollars grow scarce , new investors refuse to pay in , and the scheme crumbles .
Unfortunately , the American people , typical suckers in such a con game , will be left with a mile - high stack of IOU's .
In any Ponzi scheme comparison with Madoff , however , one difference ( other than size ) stands out .
Sooner or later , Madoff , like Charles Ponzi himself , will end up behind bars , while George , Dick , & Co. will be writing their memoirs and living off the fat of the land .
Eight years of bodies , dead , broken , mutilated , abused ; eight years of ruined lives down countless drains ; eight years of massive destruction to places from Baghdad to New Orleans where nothing of significance was ever rebuilt : all this was brought to us by a President , now leaving office without apology , who said the following in his first inaugural address : " I will live and lead by these principles : to advance my convictions with civility ... to call for responsibility and try to live it as well . "
He lived , however , by quite a different code .
Destruction without responsibility , that 's Bush 's legacy , but who 's counting now that the destruction mounts and the bodies begin to pile up here in the " homeland , " in our own body count nation ?
The laid off , the pension - less , the homeless , the suicides -- imagine what that trillion dollars might have meant to them .
It 's clear enough in these last days of the Bush administration that its model was Iraq , dismantled and devastated .
The world , had he succeeded , might have become George W. Bush 's Iraq .
Yes , he came up short , but , given the global economic situation , how much short we do n't yet know .
Perhaps , in the future , historians will call him a Caesar -- of destruction .
Veni , vidi , vastavi ...

Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank increased sharply in 2008 , despite Israel ’s pledge at the beginning of the year to freeze all construction , according to a new report by an Israeli non-governmental organization [ .pdf ] .
The report , released Wednesday by the group Peace Now , found that settlement construction in 2008 increased by almost 60 percent , including new construction both inside and outside of the security barrier and within illegal settlement outposts .
The Peace Now study was released on the same day that newly appointed U.S. peace envoy George Mitchell  a longtime critic of settlement construction  arrived in Israel .
The increase in construction is expected to be a source of friction in Mitchell ’s negotiations with Israeli leaders .
Critics warned that the increase in construction is likely to damage the already fragile prospects for a two - state solution in Israel and Palestine .
" Every structure built in a settlement makes the two - state solution more difficult to achieve and further jeopardizes Israel ’s future as a Jewish democratic country , " said Debra DeLee , president of Peace Now ’s sister organization Americans for Peace Now .
The report found that at least 1,257 new structures were built in West Bank settlements in 2008 , up sharply from 800 in 2007 .
This figure did not include the 261 new structures built in illegal outposts in the West Bank .
Nearly 40 percent of the new structures were built east of the security barrier , many of them extending deep into the West Bank .
And despite the Israeli government ’s pledge to crack down on the illegal outposts , the study found that " not a single real outpost was evacuated . "
Additionally , the report found evidence that land confiscations were continuing to take place , contradicting the government ’s stated policy .
Following the Annapolis peace conference in late 2007 , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert pledged to freeze settlement construction and remove some existing settlements .
In November 2008 , he announced that the government would cut off funding for illegal outposts  thereby admitting that it had continued to fund them up to that point .
The Peace Now report found that the Israeli government had encouraged the increase in settlement construction both through active aid and through non-enforcement of its stated policies .
Also on Wednesday , U.S. envoy Mitchell arrived in Jerusalem and met with leaders including Olmert , Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , and Defense Minister Ehud Barak .
He is scheduled to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salaam Fayad in Ramallah , and Likud Party chief Binyamin Netanyahu on Friday .
Although preliminary reports indicated that the aftermath of the war in Gaza was the primary topic under discussion at Wednesday ’s meetings , the settlements are expected to be a continued sticking point going forward .
Mitchell served an earlier stint as Middle East peace envoy in 2001 , after which his committee released a report that was harshly critical of Israeli settlement policies .
The 2001 Mitchell report called on Israel to " freeze all settlement activity , including the ‘ natural growth ’ of existing settlements . "
This call was taken up in the George W. Bush administration ’s " road map " for the peace process , which formed the basis of the 2007 Annapolis conference .
Mitchell ’s insistence on a settlement freeze as a precondition for the peace process led many right - leaning pro-Israel groups in the U.S. to oppose his recent selection as peace envoy .
Abraham Foxman , the influential head of the Anti-Defamation League , stated that he was " concerned " about Mitchell ’s " meticulously evenhanded " approach to the region .
Nevertheless , in the eight years since Mitchell ’s initial report , his calls for a halt to the settlement project have become a mainstream consensus view .
Olmert and his predecessor Ariel Sharon  who had been an original architect of the settlement project  both came to believe that it was likely to doom Israel if left unchecked .
Given the basic demographic trends , an Israeli state encompassing the West Bank and Gaza would soon have an Arab majority .
This would force Israel to choose between becoming a secular and binational state with full political rights for all citizens , or an undemocratic state that denied full political rights to Arab residents .
It was partially this logic led Sharon to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and remove Israeli settlements there in 2005 .
However , the challenge in the West Bank is much greater .
There are now estimated to be over 285,000 settlers in the West Bank , many of them militantly opposed to a two - state solution .
The Israeli government has generally paid lip service to the goal of curbing the West Bank settlers , but has been reluctant to crack down on them .
If Netanyahu becomes the next Israeli prime minister , as currently seems likely , he and Mitchell could be set to clash on the settlements issue .
Netanyahu has recently tacked to the center on the issue , telling Quartet envoy Tony Blair on Sunday that a Likud - led government would build no new settlements .
However , Netanyahu said that he would continue to permit " natural growth " of existing settlements  a qualification that strips his promise of much of its meaning .
Israel has not officially created any new settlements in over a decade , instead ascribing all settlement construction to " natural growth . "
It was this consideration that led both Mitchell ’s 2001 report and Bush ’s road map to explicitly forbid construction under the auspices of " natural growth . "
Gershom Gorenberg , author of The Accidental Empire , a 2007 history of the settlements , urged Mitchell to stand firm against Netanyahu in an open letter published Wednesday in The American Prospect .
Netanyahu ’s position is a " con , " Gorenberg wrote .
" You need to insist on [ a full settlement freeze ] publicly in the months ahead . "
At the moment , however , none of the leading candidates for prime minister appears to have much appetite to confront the settlers .
How much pressure Mitchell and the Obama administration are willing to exert on the Israeli government to do so will be one of the first tests of the U.S. - Israel relationship in the months ahead .
Swarms of satellites each weighing less than 100 grams and not much bigger than a personal digital assistant or even a cell phone could soon be heading for space .
These so - called femto satellites could quickly displace the behemoths of yesteryear that weigh in at up to a tonne and may revolutionize applications in telecommunications , military , entertainment , science , weather and climate forecasting , at much lower fabrication and launch costs .
We ’ve all seen TV footage of those enormous rockets thrusting upwards from distant launchpads , seemingly hanging in the air and yet accelerating upwards at incredible speed in order to pierce the sky and enter orbit .
Onboard such a rocket , will usually be a payload , a satellite , destined for earthly orbit , a device that until recently may have weighed more than a tonne .
These enormous satellites cost a fortune to build , even more to launch , and still more to cover the insurance premiums .
Smaller satellites would be so much better for dozens of reasons and over the last decade , their size has dropped below the one tonne mark , and then to the few hundred kilograms , more recently to micro satellites that weigh a few tens of kilograms .
However , there was never any reason not to build something smaller that could be reduced in size , and so we have seen in recent years the launch of a flotilla of “ nano ” satellites that weigh between 1 and 10 kg , then pico satellites that are just a few hundred grams , and soon we could see femto satellites that weigh less than 100 grams .
[ NB the nano , pico and femto referred to here are arbitrary descriptors of the relative mass of the satellites .
For more on the true meaning of nano , pico , and femto ]
Warren Leary , writing in the New York Times ago , described the promise of microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) as applied to satellite technology and hinted at the possibility of a satellite - on - a - chip .
He discussed the work of Siegfried Janson and colleagues at The Aerospace Corporation , in El Segundo , California , and quoted him as describing , ‘ Fully integrated satellites that could be mass produced cheaply by the hundreds and sent into space in groups to perform a variety of tasks . ”
We are not quite at the stage of sending out satellite swarms but the miniaturisation of satellites has continued apace with designs , such as the CubeSat system , allowing researchers and companies to design satellites based on a standard payload that
“ Pico - satellites are viable development platforms for testing new technologies in the space environment , explain M.W.R. Alger and K.D. Kumar Department of Aerospace Engineering , at Ryerson University , Toronto , Canada .
Writing in the International Journal of Manufacturing Research ( 2008 , 3 , 48-79 ) , “ The opportunities given to fly the earliest pico - satellites as secondary payloads have benefited all facets of the space community both by effectively training the next generation of spacecraft designers and by pushing the boundaries of space technology at largely reduced risk and cost . ”
They point out that these pico satellites have a lot to contend with , “ Space is a very unforgiving environment , with many different hazards then those found on the Earth .
The major hazards to overcome are : radiation , temperature variations , space debris , and out - gassing . ”
The first pico satellites , weighing less than a kilogram , flew on the OPAL and Sapphire missions and subsequently their success led to the CubeSat standard , with devices about 100x100x100 mm .
“ The strategy for deploying these satellites in orbit involves launching a group of small pico- satellites in a deployment device known as a Poly Pico- satellite Orbital Deployer ( PPOD ) , ” the researchers explain , “ The PPOD integrates with the launch vehicle and carries three normal sized CubeSats . ”
Several of the most successful CubeSats have been built by students at various universities .
Now , many other teams around the globe have been building their own CubeSats .
“ Femto - satellites [ click the graphic for a better view ] will be the next new class of satellites , ” the researchers say , “ There is a possibility of shrinking the capabilities of a typical pico - satellite bus ( attitude control , imaging missions , communications etc. ) on to a single chip . ”
It is possible that current consumer manufacturing processes for personal digital assistants and cell phones will drive the development of femto satellites .
Scientists have already developed a prototype configuration – a Ryerson Femto Formation Flying Experiment ( RyF3ex ) spacecraft as a demonstrator technology .
This femto satellite will simply report back its altitude to a ground station .
Femto satellites will have several limitations , however , and are more likely to be launched as a swarm by a larger spacecraft .
“ Femto - satellites derived from this technology maybe an interesting approach for deep space exploration where a larger satellite could launch a cluster of disposable femto - satellites to examine a planet or asteroid of interest and after completing this mission , the larger satellite could orbit another planet and deploy a new cluster to do a similar mission , ” the researchers add .

How did the ancient Pueblos come to have cacao beans in the desert , more than 1,200 miles from the nearest cacao trees ?
Ms. Crown , a University of New Mexico anthropologist , noted that maize , beans and corn spread to the Southwest after being domesticated in southern Mexico .
Earlier excavations at Pueblo Bonito , the largest structure in the Chaco complex , had found scarlet macaws and other imported items .
Image Researchers believe ancient Pueblos used the jars to drink chocolate .

Dorie Reents - Budet , a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and a Smithsonian Institution research associate specializing in Mayan cylinder vases , said that a sophisticated Mesoamerican trade network extended to Chaco in the north and as far south as Ecuador and Colombia .
The Mayan vessels , decorated with court scenes and hieroglyphics , were used to ceremonially consume chocolate at sumptuous feasts , Ms. Reents - Budet said .
An expensive luxury , the cacao beans were fermented , roasted and ground up , then mixed with water and flavorings before being whipped into froth .
It made sense to present the beverage in a special vessel , she said .
“ It ’s as if you were having a dinner party and serving Champagne , ” said Ms. Reents - Budet .
“ You serve Champagne in really nice glasses . ”
After an exchange with Ms. Reents - Budet in October 2007 about the resemblances between the Chacoan and Mayan earthenware , Ms. Crown said she thought about having the Chacoan cylinders checked for cacao residue .
Developments in battery technology have made cars driven by electric propulsion cost competitive with internal combustion based cars .
Based on a scenario in which a car owner drives 15,000 kilometers annually , the car is owned for a period of 6 years , and the oil price on average remains above 100 dollars per barrel in the next two decades , it was found that an electric car for the consumer is already cheaper than a gasoline powered vehicle in the Netherlands , and that this will only improve in the future .
This is the case because higher initial investments in the purchase of an electric car are more than compensated by lower fuel costs , reduced maintenance and tax benefits .
Furthermore , greenhouse gas emissions of an electric car are at least half that of the gasoline powered car based on the current Dutch electricity mix .
This is a guest post by Joost van den Bulk in which the costs and benefits of electric cars available by 2010 are compared with internal combustion cars powered by gasoline for the Netherlands .
It is a summary of his Master thesis in environmental science at Wageningen University in the Netherlands ( PDF , 3 Mb , 72 pages ) .
In recent years attention for electric cars has increased significantly .
There are many countries and regions pursuing electric car technology , including Israel , Denmark , Portugal , Germany , Ireland , and California .
Most of these countries have a goal of 500,000 to 1 million electric cars on the road by 2020 .
The necessary battery technology for all these cars is developing rapidly which stimulates large and small car manufacturers to develop a production line .
Considering the current developments , it is interesting to analyze the costs , benefits and environmental consequences of electric cars compared to cars with a combustion engine .
What is the electric car ?
The biggest difference between a car with a combustion engine and the electric car lies in the drive - train ( see Figure 1 to the left ) .
The electric car is powered by an electro motor which receives its electricity from an on board battery .
In the majority of electric cars currently under development lithium - ion polymer batteries are used which combine a high energy density with durability and safety .
An inverter placed in between the battery and electro motor converts direct electric current from the battery , to alternating electric current supplied to the electro motor and car electronics .
An electric car can be charged in four to eight hours by plugging it in the standard electricity grid or in fifteen minutes by connecting it to a high voltage charging station .
Cost comparison
The costs of a car can be divided in depreciation costs , fuel costs , maintenance costs and fixed costs shown in table 1 .
These costs are based on specific parameters such as the efficiency of a car .
The fixed costs of the car consist of road tax , insurance and membership of the Automobile Association patrol .
Current costs of the electric car and a car with an internal combustion engine can be compared by developing a car usage scenario .
In the scenario included here I assume an annual driving distance of 15,000 km , a car ownership of 6 years , and two oil price and related electricity price scenarios .
The first scenario is based on IEA assumptions in the World Energy Outlook 2008 which assume an average global oil price of over $ 100 per barrel between 2010 and 2030 ( see figure below ) .
In this scenario the Dutch gasoline price increases from the 2007 average of 1.40 euro per liter to 1.50 euro per liter in 2020 and 1.60 euro per liter in 2030 .
The energy content of gasoline is 34.3 mega joule per liter which results in a base electricity price of 0.15 eurocent per kilowatt hour in 2008 , 0.16 in 2020 and 0.17 in 2030 .
Figure 2 - oil price scenario from the World Energy Outlook 2008 reference case by the International Energy Agency .
In the second gasoline price scenario it is assumed that the Dutch petrol price increases gradually to 2.00 euro per liter by 2030 , which is equal to an annual inflation corrected gasoline price increase of 1.56 % .
Resulting in a gasoline price of 1.7 euro per liter by 2020 and an electricity price of 0.18 eurocent per kilowatthour in 2020 and 0.21 euro cent in 2030 .
Depreciation costs - A Detroit Electric Subcompact electric car which will be available around 2009 / 2010 on the Dutch market is expected to cost 22,491 euro .
It is estimated that the car will have an expected rest value of 7,000 euro after 6 years with an assumed battery life of 10 years .
The rest value of a comparable gasoline / diesel car with a new price of 15,000 euro is expected to depreciate to 4500 euro after 6 years .
In this scenario the depreciation costs of the electric car are 17 eurocent per driven kilometer .
The depreciation costs of the combustion car are 12 cents per driven kilometer .
Fuel costs -
Fuel costs per kilometer of an electric car are based on the consumer electricity price per kWh and the overall energy efficiency of the car .
With 23 eurocent / kWh the electricity price of Dutch households is one of the highest in Europe .
The energy efficiency of the electric car is almost 8 kilometer / kWh which results in an electricity cost of 3 eurocent per kilometer .
Fuel costs of a car with an internal combustion engine are calculated by multiplying the costs of gasoline ( Euro 95 ) with the fuel use of the car .
The average Dutch gasoline price in 2008 was € 1.40 for a liter of Euro 95 .
Fuel use of a compact combustion car under mixed traffic conditions ( combination of city and highway traffic ) is 6.2 liter per 100 kilometer which results in fuel costs of almost 9 eurocent per driven kilometer .
Maintenance costs -
The electric car contains few moving components which are vulnerable to wearing out .
The electro motor for example contains one moving component while the combustion engine contains dozens .
Regular combustion car maintenance such as the replacement of oil and filters is not necessary with electric vehicles .
The yearly maintenance costs of electric cars are estimated to be € 180 which results in maintenance costs of 1 cent per kilometer .
The drive - train of a car with an internal combustion engine contains a considerable number of moving components which are vulnerable to wear out such as the internal combustion engine , transmission system , and gearbox .
Cars with a combustion engine need regular maintenance including the replacement of oil , oil filters and spark plugs .
The annual maintenance costs of a compact car with a combustion engine are €440 which results in 3 eurocent per driven kilometer .
Fixed costs -
The fixed costs of a car consist of road tax , insurance , membership of the Automobile Association patrol and cleaning costs .
At this moment the fixed costs for electric car owners are lower than the fixed costs for combustion cars because the owners of electric cars do not have to pay road taxes .
On a monthly base fixed costs for electric car owners amount to 90 euro which results in 7 cent per driven kilometer .
Combustion car owners have to pay an additional amount of € 40 on road taxes monthly which results in fixed costs of 10 cent per kilometer .
Total costs -
The total costs per kilometer of a compact electric car are at 2008 oil prices 5.5 cent lower than total costs of a compact combustion car as shown in table 2 .
The new price of an electric car is higher but the fuel costs , maintenance costs and fixed costs result in cost benefits over a time period of 6 years .
Future development
The future development of the kilometer price of electric cars and combustion cars can be estimated by developing scenarios for the parameters on which the costs of a car are based .
By 2020 it is expected that the large scale production of electric cars and improvements in battery technology will result in reduced electric car costs .
The amount of yearly driven kilometers is expected to increase to 16,500 by 2020 and a kilometer tax which is coupled to CO2 emissions of a car is expected to be implemented , included in table 3 .
According to the scenario the total costs per kilometer of a compact electric car are estimated to be 4.9 cent lower than total costs of a compact combustion car by 2020 as shown in table 4 .
The new price of an electric car remain higher due to its more costly components , but the lower fuel costs , maintenance costs and tax costs result in cost benefits over a time period of 6 years .
Environmental impacts
Electric cars drive on electricity which is stored in the on board battery .
An electric car is not directly dependent on oil because electricity is generated by a variety of sources .
The compact electric cars which are developed at the moment have a range of 200 to 300 kilometer on a full battery .
It can be charged on the standard electricity grid or by charging poles situated at parking lots .
Use of electricity instead of gasoline has consequences on the environmental impact of the electric car .
Measured by the CO2 and particulate matter ( PM2,5 and PM10 ) production per driven kilometer .
Besides environmental impacts due to the energy use the battery of the electric car is an important aspect from an environmental and resource perspective .
Environmental impacts of a combustion engine - The European Union has decided that CO2 emissions of a car driven by a combustion engine should be reduced to 130 gram per kilometer by 2012 .
At the moment , CO2 emission of an average Dutch car are 150 gram per kilometer .
The efficiency of the production process of oil is estimated to be 83 % which results in a well - to - wheel CO2 emission of 180 gram per kilometer .
Current PM10 production of combustion cars with a soot filter is 5 mg per kilometer .
Road traffic is the main cause of particulate matter - and air pollution such as SOX , NOX and ozone in the Netherlands .
Furthermore , combustion cars emit their exhaust gas directly in the urban environment which results in air pollution of the urban environment .
Environmental impacts of Dutch electricity production -
The majority of Dutch electricity is produced in power plants which are powered by natural gas .
Other electricity sources are successively electricity from coal powered plants , hydro , wind and solar powered energy , nuclear energy , oil and other sources , shown in figure 2 .
According to Dutch electricity companies average CO2 emission per kWh of produced electricity in the Netherlands is 450 gram .
An electricity grid efficiency of 92 % and an electric car efficiency of 8 kilometer per kWh results in well - to - wheel CO2 emissions of 60 gram per kilometer .
CO2 emissions of the electric car can be further reduced by increasing efficiency of the electricity production process and increasing electricity from sustainable sources such as wind and solar power .
Per kilometer , electric cars have a lower PM10 production compared to cars with a combustion engine .
Power plants cause no air pollution in the urban environment which reduces health risks .
Environmental impact of the battery - Electric car producers already guarantee a battery lifetime of 160,000 kilometer for models currently on the market .
Sufficient to drive 11 years when one drives 15,000 kilometers annually , a distance covered by the average Dutch car driver .
Improvements in battery technology and battery management systems are expected to increase the lifetime of the batteries further .
The Lithium-ion polymer batteries which are used in electric cars nowadays are relatively environmental friendly because they contain no heavy metals or other toxic compounds , opposite to Zinc acid batteries .
Lithium -ion battery are claimed to be completely recyclable by companies such as Tesla motors .
Costs involved in recycling need to be included in the new price of the car as to ensure proper handling of the material .
When electric cars are implemented on a large scale the recycling process of the Lithium-ion batteries provides economic opportunities due to the value of the material remaining after the battery life time is spent .
Another possibility lies in using a former electric car battery as a stationary electricity storage station .
Because when a car battery is not suited for use in a car anymore it still has 80 % of its charging capacity .

Somewhere in the deep recesses of Columbia University , there is a little piece of bridge that is growing up fast .
The cable , 20 inches thick and 20 feet long , was created by Columbia research engineers to simulate the suspension cables of the sort one sees on the Brooklyn , Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges .
It ’s hard to tell whether this cable - – made of nearly 10,000 steel wires , each five millimeters in diameter –- is being pampered or tortured .
It is preciously encased in a clear plastic box and undergoes a meticulously organized regimen of heat , cold , rain and shine in the cavernous Carleton Laboratory on Columbia ’s campus in Morningside Heights .
Overhead sprinklers douse it with water for four hours .
Then heat lamps take over for four hours , baking the cable , which is later cooled by an air - conditioner .
The cable is also on a stretching rack , strung between the iron sides of a heavy frame , with hydraulic jacks providing 1.2 million pounds of tension .
All told , the environmental chamber can very quickly create the equivalent of decades of outdoor exposure .
Columbia researchers began building the test cable more than two years ago in a search for an efficient way to test the health and strength of the cables on New York City ’s aging suspension bridges .
“ If this goes , the entire bridge goes , ” said Raimondo Betti , who is running the project , showing off the cable last week .
“ In New York City , we have among the oldest suspension bridges in the world , ” said Mr. Betti , a professor in the university ’s School of Engineering and a specialist in bridge structural dynamics .
“ These type of cables have life spans up to 150 years , and they will continue to deteriorate if nothing is done . ”
The Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883 , the Williamsburg Bridge in 1903 , and the Manhattan Bridge in 1909 — so all their cables are approaching old age .
Although the cable itself is the eye - catcher at the Columbia lab —
“ This is the biggest dummy cable ever built in the world , ” Mr. Betti said — the sensors and the electronic and computer system they feed are the product being developed .
There are several microphones and more than 70 sensors in the test cable to monitor corrosion and deterioration over the six - month test period , which officially begins Monday .
The sensors measure things like corrosion rates , temperature , humidity , acidity and chlorine content .
The ultrasensitive microphones detect cracking in the steel strands .
To fully test the accuracy of the sensors , Mr. Betti wants to apply enough stress to the cable to accelerate that aging process .
In six months , he will do an autopsy on the cable and see how well the sensors measured the cable ’s breakdown .
This $ 2 million project , financed by the Federal Highway Administration , will develop the tools to give the most thorough and sophisticated safety assessment ever given to New York ’s suspension bridge cables , Mr. Betti said .
There is a very practical reason for finding a good way to give the cables a good physical : to find optimum solutions for repairing or replacing them before drastic problems set in .
Mr. Betti estimates that the loss of a New York City suspension bridge would cost $ 10 billion , but there are situations in which single cables can be replaced –- at a mere $ 100 million –- without rebuilding the entire bridge .
Along with city officials , partners in the project include the Parsons Corporation , an engineering and construction company in Manhattan , and the Physical Acoustics Corporation , which is operating the computer and electronic system fed by the sensors .
Bojidar S. Yanev , a bridge expert at the Department of Transportation , said the three older suspension bridges had been built extraordinarily well and were “ holding up even when other bridges built much later are having more problems . ”
“ The objective is to create in the lab conditions as extreme as possible , and to use every bit of monitoring technique that exists , ” he said .
He added that the project represented a shift in thinking .
“ We are trying to move away from the old days , ” he said , “ when they did bridge inspections just to avoid having them fall down and kill somebody . ”
The Buy America provisions in the House stimulus bill were bad enough .
The Senate version threatens to make them even worse , extending them from government purchases of steel to government purchases of all manufactures .
These measures are possibly illegal in international law , flatly contradict a commitment that the US made at the G20 summit in November , and ( most important ) are likely to hurt the economy more than help it .
Is this the new spirit of US multilateralism ?
Smoot Hawley , anyone ?
Read the analysis by Gary Hufbauer and Jeff Schott of the Peterson Institute .
Based on economic and legal analysis , the authors conclude that the Buy American provisions would violate US trade obligations and damage the United States ' reputation , with very little impact on US jobs .
They estimate that the additional US steel production fostered by the Buy American provisions will amount to around 0.5 million metric tons .
This in turn translates into a gain in steel industry employment equal to roughly 1,000 jobs .
The job impact is small because steel is very capital intensive .
In the giant US economy , with a labor force of roughly 140 million people , 1,000 jobs more or less is a rounding error .
On balance the Buy American provisions could well cost jobs if other countries emulate US policies or retaliate against them .
Most importantly , the Buy American provisions contradict the G - 20 commitment not to implement new protectionist measures -- a commitment that was designed to forestall a rush of " beggar - thy - neighbor " policies .
What should be done ?
The best result would be to simply delete the Buy American provision in the House - Senate conference .
Next best would be to keep the House version , applying the Buy American restriction only to iron and steel , but stating explicitly -- in either the statutory text or in the legislative history -- that the public interest waiver is intended to be used to avoid violations of US trade obligations .
The third option is a presidential statement -- preferably before legislation is finalized -- that the United States will respect its international obligations when it applies the Buy American provisions .
The jobless rate is hanging high -- for many of the roughly 3,000 political appointees who served President George W. Bush .
Finding work has proved a far tougher task than those appointees expected .
" This is not a great time for anyone to be job hunting , including numerous former political appointees , " said Carlos M. Gutierrez , Mr. Bush 's commerce secretary .
Previously chief executive of cereal maker Kellogg Co. , he hopes to run a company again because " I have a lot of energy . "
Only 25 % to 30 % of ex-Bush officials seeking full - time jobs have succeeded , estimated Eric Vautour , a Washington recruiter at Russell Reynolds Associates Inc .
That " is much , much worse " than when Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton left the White House , he said .
At least half those presidents ' senior staffers landed employment within a month after the administration ended , Mr. Vautour recalled .
A handful of Bush cabinet officers have accepted academic appointments .
Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson joined Johns Hopkins University 's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies as a fellow .
Condoleezza Rice , previously secretary of state , resumed her Stanford University roles as a political - science professor and senior fellow at its Hoover Institution think tank .
J. Michael McConnell , the ex-director of national intelligence , also rejoined a prior employer .
He resumed work this week as a senior vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton , the title he held when he left the management consultancy to become U.S. spy chief .
Last week , Fidelity Investments named Anthony Ryan , a former acting Treasury undersecretary , to head its asset - management strategy .
To begin with , take 10 minutes and watch this 60 Minutes video .
Leslie Stahl makes some very interesting comments on the morality and ethics of mind - control .
Here are mine :
1 . The technology called FMRI ( Functional Magnetic Resonance ) is old and archaic actually .
Mengele and others were “ reading ” brain waves via magnetic resonance graphing in the early 70’s .
Boston - Logan Airport is already using new light - wave beams to scan and read air traveler ’s intentions before they board the planes .
2 . The German individual Stahl interviewed was very hesitant to reveal exactly who had the mind - reading technology today .
Again , just look at the U.S. Patents issued in the last decade to realize the height and breadth of the mind - control explosion — and keep in mind that patents are usually applied for after the technology has been proven to be commercially viable via working models .
3 . The FMRI “ computer ” that “ reads the mind ” is just one side of the coin .
It is much , much easier to produce emotions and impulses into the brain than to actually read the brain via computer programs .
4 . This technology needs much more bandwidth space than is currently provided by analog signals in order to be implemented .
Thus , the need to switch to digital signals exclusively .
5 . This technology , in the wrong hands , is a bigger threat to individual freedom than any standing army .
6 . Is Homeland Security the “ wrong hands ” ?
Why is this just now beginning to be reported by such news programs as “ 60 Minutes ” ?
Read this patent abstract , and then read my exposé on digital TV once again in the context of Stahl ’s report .

Title : Nervous System Manipulation by EM Fields from Monitors .
Issued to : Loos , Hendricus .
Abstract : Physiological effects have been observed in a human subject in response to stimulation of the skin with weak electromagnetic fields that are pulsed with certain frequencies near 1/2 Hz or 2.4
Hz , such as to excite a sensory resonance .
Many computer monitors and HD TV screens , when displaying pulsed images , emit pulsed electromagnetic fields of sufficient amplitudes to cause such excitation .
It is therefore possible to manipulate the nervous system of a subject by pulsing images displayed on a nearby computer monitor or DIGITAL TV set .
For the latter , the image pulsing may be embedded in the program material , or it may be overlaid by modulating a video stream , either as an RF signal or as a video signal .
The image displayed on a computer monitor may be pulsed effectively by a simple computer program .
For certain monitors , pulsed electromagnetic fields capable of exciting sensory resonances in nearby subjects may be generated even as the displayed images are pulsed with subliminal intensity .
Opinion What Obama Could Learn from Germany
The United States is experiencing its worst crisis in decades .
Obama is trying to fight it by preparing one gigantic economic stimulus program after the other .
But the hangover is inevitable , and if the desired economic miracle does n't materialize , it will be a massive one .

The GOP 's Anti-Obama Propaganda Today ’s Republicans are thumbing through Newt Gingrich ’s worn playbook of 1993 looking for tips on how to blunt President Barack Obama ’s political momentum and flip it to their advantage .
In doing so , they also appear to have dug in to what might be called the secret appendix .

The official history of what happened during Bill Clinton ’s difficult first two years – which ended in a sweeping Republican congressional victory in 1994 – focuses on the GOP ’s united resistance to his economic plan and Hillary Clinton ’s failed health care reform .
But there was a darker side to the political damage inflicted on the early Clinton administration .
Republicans and their right - wing allies disseminated what – in a covert operation – would be called “ black propaganda . ”
Some exaggerated minor scandals , like the Travel Office firings and Clinton ’s Whitewater real - estate deal , while other key figures on the Right , such as the Rev. Jerry Falwell , spread ugly conspiracy rumors linking Clinton to “ mysterious deaths ” and cocaine smuggling .
Sometimes , these multiplying “ Clinton scandals ” built on themselves with the help of their constant repetition in both the right - wing and mainstream news media .
For instance , overheated accusations about some personnel changes at the White House Travel Office pushed deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster into a deep depression .
Then , on July 30 , 1993 , a distraught Foster went to Fort Marcy Park along the Potomac River and shot himself .
The Right quickly transformed the tragedy into a new front in the anti-Clinton psychological warfare , with Foster ’s death giving rise to a cottage industry for conspiracy theorists and a new way to raise doubts about Clinton .
Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh , among others , popularized the notion that Foster may have been killed elsewhere , with his body then transported to Fort Marcy Park .
Repeated official investigations confirmed the obvious facts of Foster ’s suicide but could not quell the conspiracy rumors .
[ For the fullest account of the Foster case , see Dan Moldea ’s A Washington Tragedy . ]
The “ mystery ” around Foster ’s death also bolstered the “ mysterious deaths ” list , which mostly contained names of people who had only tangential connections to Clinton .
The effectiveness of the list was the sheer volume of the names , creating the illusion that Clinton must be a murderer even though there was no real evidence implicating Clinton in any of the deaths .
As the list was blast - faxed far and wide , one of my right - wing sources called me up about the list and said , “ even if only a few of these are real , that ’s one helluva story . ”
I responded that if the President of the United States had murdered just one person that would be “ one helluva story , ” but that there was no evidence that Clinton was behind any of the deaths .
Other dark Clinton “ mysteries ” were spread through videos , like “ The Clinton Chronicles ” that Falwell hawked on his “ Old - Time Gospel Hour ” television show .
Plus , salacious tales about the personal lives of the Clintons were popularized via right - wing magazines , such as The American Spectator , and the rapidly expanding world of right - wing talk radio .
The Right also generated broader conspiracy theories about “ black helicopters ” threatening patriotic Americans with a United Nations takeover .
The paranoia fed the rise of a “ militia movement ” of angry white men who dressed up in fatigues and went into the woods for paramilitary training .
By fall 1994 , Clinton ’s stumbling performance in office and the public doubts created by the black propaganda opened the way for a stunning Republican victory .
Recognizing the influence of talk radio in spreading the Clinton smears , House Republicans made Rush Limbaugh an honorary member of the GOP caucus .
However , the forces that the anti-Clinton psy-war campaign set in motion had unintended consequences .
In the months after the Republicans gained control of Congress , one pro-militia extremist , Timothy McVeigh , took the madness to the next step and blew up the Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City on April 19 , 1995 , killing 168 people .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Clinton Coup d’Etat ? ” ]
Reprising the Smears Now , 16 years since the start of Clinton ’s presidency , the Republicans and their right - wing allies are again on the outside of Washington power and are back studying the lessons of 1993 - 94 .
Only a month into Obama ’s presidency , there are some striking similarities in the two historical moments .
In both cases , the Democrats inherited recessions and huge budget deficits from Republican presidents named Bush .
In both cases , congressional Republicans rallied against the economic package of the new President hoping to strangle the young Democratic administrations in their cradles .
And , as congressional Republicans worked on a more overt political level , their media allies and other operatives were getting busy at subterranean depths , reviving attack lines from the campaigns to sow doubts about the two Democratic presidents – and trying to whip up the right - wing base into a near revolutionary fervor .
So far at least , the Republicans are experiencing less success against Barack Obama than they did against Bill Clinton .
According to opinion polls , Obama remains widely popular with an American public that favors his more activist agenda for reviving the American economy and confronting systemic problems like energy , health care and education .
Though Republicans scored points inside the Beltway with their opposition to Obama ’s $ 787 billion stimulus bill – and their complaints that Obama " failed " in his bipartisan outreach to them – the GOP tactics appear to have backfired with the American people .
Gauging public opinion one month into Obama ’s presidency , polls found that most Americans faulted the Republicans for rebuffing Obama ’s gestures of bipartisanship , and a New York Times / CBS News poll discovered that a majority said Obama “ should pursue the priorities he campaigned on … rather than seek middle ground with Republicans . ”
[ NYT , Feb. 24 , 2009 ]
But the Republicans seem incapable of coming up with any other strategy than to seek Obama ’s destruction , much as they torpedoed Clinton .
The three moderate Republican senators who supported the stimulus package – Susan Collins , Olympia Snowe and Arlen Specter – were widely denounced by the right - wing media as “ traitors . ”
Indeed , the Republican Party arguably has become captive to the angry right - wing media that the GOP conservatives did so much to help create in the late 1970s , after the Vietnam War defeat and Richard Nixon ’s Watergate debacle .
This Right - Wing Machine proved useful in protecting Ronald Reagan during the Iran - Contra scandal ; undermining Clinton in the 1990s ; dirtying up Al Gore in 2000 ; and wrapping George W. Bush in the protective garb of a full - scale cult of personality after 9/11 .
But the machine wore down in its defense of Bush ’s multitude of disasters and ultimately could not generate enough suspicions about Obama to elect John McCain .
Still , it remains a potent force in the country and particularly among the Republican “ base . ”
It is also a machine that can run only on the high - octane fuel of anger and hate .
If it tried to down - shift to a more responsible approach to politics , it would stall out , losing its core audience of angry white men who feel deeply aggrieved by their loss of status .
In turn , Republican leaders can’t disown the right - wing media infrastructure that has advanced their interests for so long .
In the first month of Obama ’s presidency , the congressional Republicans fell in line behind Rush Limbaugh ’s openly declared desire for Obama to fail .
Now , the Republicans may see little choice but to bet on the ability of their Right - Wing Machine to continue spreading doubts and hysteria about Obama .
More books and DVDs can be expected soon , recycling the 2008 campaign ’s rumor - mongering on Obama – that he was n’t born in the United States , that he ’s a secret Muslim , that he ’s in league with 1960s radical Bill Ayers , etc. Rumbling Insurrection Much like the Clinton - era militia movement ’s fear of “ black helicopters , ” there already are rumblings about the need for an armed uprising to thwart Obama ’s alleged “ communist ” agenda .
Ironically , right - wingers who defended George W. Bush when he mounted a radical assault on the Constitution – seeking to establish an imperial presidency while eliminating habeas corpus and other key freedoms – are suddenly seeing threats to the Constitution from Obama .
Fox News , in particular , has been floating the idea of armed rebellion .
On Feb. 20 – the one - month anniversary of Obama ’s inauguration – Glenn Beck hosted a special program called “ War Room ” that “ war - gamed ” various scenarios including the overthrow of an oppressive U.S. government when “ bubba ” militias rise up and gain the support of the American military .
The segment featured former CIA officer Michael Scheuer , retired U.S. Army Sgt. Major Tim Strong , and Gerald Celente , a prognosticator who began pitching the idea of an armed rebellion on Fox News shortly after Obama ’s election last November .
“ This is going to be violent , ” said Celente , founder of Trends Research Institute .
“ People ca n’t afford it [ taxes ] anymore .
The cities are going to look like Dodge City .
They ’re going to be uncontrollable .
You ’re going to have gangs in control .
Motorcycle marauders .
You ’re not going to have enough police or federales – just like Mexico – to control the situation . ”
Beck envisioned the uprising – theoretically set in 2014 – starting “ because people have been so disenfranchised ” leading to a “ bubba effect ” touched off by federal agents from the ATF or FBI arresting some rancher in Texas or Arizona who has taken the law into his own hands in defending his property .
“ That ’s totally possible , ” ex-Sgt .
Strong said .
“ You ’ve got people who are going to do the right thing to truly protect the interests of the United States , to include their own .
…
Your second and third orders of effect are going to be your bubbas hunkering down and being anti-government . ”
Beck , who was a longtime fixture on CNN ’s Headline News before moving to Fox , then expanded on the justification for the bubba uprising against a federal government that was “ coming in and disenfranchising people over and over and over again – and having the people say please listen to us . ”
According to Beck , these oppressed Americans “ know the Constitution .
They know the writings of the Founders and they feel that the government – or they will in this scenario and I think we ’re on this road – the government has betrayed the Constitution .
So they will see themselves as people who are standing up for the Constitution . ”
Beck then turned to ex-CIA officer Scheuer and asked , “ So how do you defuse this , Michael , or how long even do we have before this becomes a crazy real scenario ? ”
“ I do n’t think you ’d want to defuse it , Glenn , ” Scheuer responded .
“ The Second Amendment is … at base not about hunting or about a militia , but about resisting tyranny .
The Founders were very concerned about allowing individual citizens weaponry to defend themselves as a last resort against a tyrannical government . ”
As the discussion edged toward advocacy of violent revolution , Beck sought to reel it back in a bit .
“ Do n’t get me wrong , ” the host said .
“ I am against the government .
And I think they ’ve just been horrible .
I do think they are betraying the principles of our Founders every day they ’re in office .
But I have to tell you this scenario scares the living daylights out of me because it is shaking nitroglycerine . ”
Beck then got back to the point : “ Do the soldiers come in and do they round up people or do they fight with the people for the Constitution ?
What does the Army , what does the military do ? ”
Scheuer answered : “ I do n’t think the military is ever going to shoot on the American people , sir .
I think the military – of all people – read the Constitution every year , right through . ”
Beck then suggested that Obama ’s stimulus package might lead to this back - door federal tyranny .
“ We just had in our stimulus package a way for if your governor says no to the money , the legislature can go around the governor and go right to the Feds , ” Beck said .
“ It ’s this kind of thing that would make the federal government say , ‘ You know what ?
We can call up the National Guard .
We do n’t need your governor to do it . ’”
Such insurrectionist musings on Fox News are not likely to be taken seriously by most people .
Indeed , many Americans may find it amusing that Fox has developed a heartfelt concern about disenfranchising voters after its enthusiastic embrace of Bush 's undemocratic " election " in 2000 or that Fox now feels a sudden reverence for the Constitution after eight years of defending Bush as he trampled it .
But this sort of Fox chatter runs the risk of feeding the well - nursed grievances of angry white “ bubbas ” and possibly inspiring a new Timothy McVeigh .
More significantly , today ’s Republican leaders – finding themselves with little new to offer – appear to have turned to the well - worn pages of this earlier GOP playbook to choose the same game plan that set the nation on a dangerous and destructive course 16 years ago , a course that only now , finally , may be playing out .

Among the most serious incidents the report documented were an October brawl among six patients that left one needing surgery , and an autistic patient being forced to perform oral sex in November .
The report also included allegations that a woman was raped and that a 14 - year - old was forced to engage in oral sex by a 16 - year - old .
All four incidents occurred after the highly publicized death of Esmin Green , a Jamaican immigrant with a history of depression , who collapsed on the floor of the emergency waiting room after waiting nearly 24 hours to be seen .
A surveillance video showed Ms. Green , 49 , lying on the floor for nearly an hour ; during that time , a guard came in to check on her by wheeling his chair along , and another staff member prodded her with a foot .
“ While perhaps unique in the extent of the harm that resulted , the tragic case of Ms. Green typifies the patterns of inadequate care and treatment , ” reads the report , from Loretta King , an acting assistant attorney general , and Benton J. Campbell , the United States attorney in Brooklyn .
The report , a summary account of the federal investigation that resulted from a 2007 lawsuit by the New York Civil Liberties Union and others , found at least three cases , including Ms. Green ’s , when employees falsified records to hide their neglect .
The report became public when Alan D. Aviles , president of the city ’s Health and Hospitals Corporation , convened a news conference on Thursday to announce that “ radical changes ” had been made at Kings County , which treats many of the city ’s most severely mentally ill .
While questioning some details of the report , he admitted that the unit “ too often failed ” its patients .

The media have already been called out on their ridiculous stacking of the news talk shows regarding the Obama stimulus plan with Republicans .
It does n't seem to be getting much better ; the Sunday talk shows were reasonably balanced this week , but most of the panels and " expert appearances " discussing the plan have been laden with rabid right - wing ideologues .
And it has n't been just on Fox , though the problem is acute there .
Yesterday on CNN , for instance , who should John King have on to discuss the stimulus on the " State of the Union " program but our old friend Grover Norquist .
Norquist pontificated at length about how a Republican alternative should look .
It was just more of the same crap conservatives have been feeding us the past decade : tax cuts , deregulation , shrink government , blah blah blah .
Now , I can think of a lot of people the public could be getting sound advice about the economy from .
Some of them could even fall in the " conservative " category .
Grover Norquist is not one of them .
After all , this is the man whose philosophy of government is summed up in one quip :
" I 'm not in favor of abolishing the government .
I just want to shrink it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub . "
In other words , this was one of the geniuses who not only brought us Katrina and food poisonings but the economic calamity now confronting us .
Thanks , but no thanks .
And until John King and his producers can demonstrate they know how to bring on people who can actually provide useful insights and not ideological propaganda , I wo n't be tuning in .
You Can Make a Difference
Dear friends ,
Less than two days .
That 's how long it took ex-President Bush 's cronies inside the federal government to strike out at President Obama and use taxpayer money to undermine him .
Last Thursday the DEA raided a medical marijuana dispensary in California , putting the lives of cancer , HIV / AIDS and other patients at risk .
But we can show President Obama that the American people will stand with him in this fight and hold him accountable for his campaign promise to end these raids .
As you may know , President Obama promised to end the Bush administration 's cruel and costly raids on medical marijuana patients and caregivers in states where marijuana is legal for medical use .
He 's in the process of replacing Bush officials who are the source of the problem , but that takes time .
Quite frankly , what the Bush loyalists inside the DEA did in South Lake Tahoe is the equivalent of giving President Obama the finger .
Now is our chance to urge President Obama to protect at - risk patients .
If he does n't stand up forcefully to Bush 's cronies , they will continue to undermine his presidency .
And terminally ill patients will suffer .
Sincerely ,
Bill Piper
Director , Office of National Affairs

It might be more interesting to please you while you ’re full of vitamins and energy !

The New York Times ’ Frank Rich : Obama is right — the people are to blame
By David Walsh
26 January 2009
Barack Obama 's inauguration has brought out the worst in a good many people , especially from within the environs of American liberalism .
The liberal pundits either invent an imaginary ‘ progressive ' Obama or come forward to express agreement with his fundamentally right - wing views and policies .
In his weekly comment Sunday , New York Times columnist Frank Rich , taking his cue from Obama 's inauguration speech , asserts that the American people share the blame for the financial crisis .
Rich writes that " Obama was n't just rebuking the outgoing administration .
He was delicately but unmistakably calling out the rest of us who went along for the ride as America swerved into the dangerous place we find ourselves now . "
Rich continues : " Feckless as it was for Bush to ask Americans to go shopping after 9/11 , we all too enthusiastically followed his lead , whether we were wealthy , working - class or in between .
We spent a decade feasting on easy money , do n't - pay - as - you - go consumerism and a metastasizing celebrity culture . "
After enumerating a number of crimes of the financial elite , Rich returns to his theme : " In less lofty precincts of the American economic spectrum , the numbers may be different but the ethos has often been similar ...
[ R]egular Americans took on all kinds of debt wildly disproportionate to their assets and income .
The nearly $ 1 trillion in unpaid credit - card balances is now on deck to be the next big crash . "
He notes that in his inaugural speech Obama issued a " somber " call for sacrifice , and , after citing the president 's reference to " workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job , " Rich adds , " There will be — there must be — far larger sacrifices in that vein yet to come . "
He concludes : " While it 's become a Beltway cliché that America 's new young president has yet to be tested , it is past time for us to realize that our own test is also about to begin . "
This is extraordinary stuff .
Aside from its sycophancy and the excuses it offers for Obama 's banal and empty speech , Rich 's column gives genuine voice to the sentiments of selfish , upper - middle - class circles .
( New York Times columnists could n't agree on the literary quality of Obama 's inaugural .
While Rich headlined his piece " No Time for Poetry " and argued that " this speech was austere , not pretty , " Times op - ed writer Stanley Fish opined that Obama " carries us from meditative bead to meditative bead , and invites us to contemplate . "
The prose style , Fish tells us , " lends itself to leisurely and loving study . "
While the aesthetic evaluations differ , there is a similar degree of groveling in both cases . )
According to Rich and his ilk , the American people share responsibility for the policies of the financial elite .
Presumably then , the various equally guilty social elements should all have benefited .
In reality , the American working class has suffered a protracted , decades - long decline in its social position , while the very rich have engorged themselves on the nation 's wealth , much of it by semi-criminal means , opening up a vast social chasm .
University of California Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez has pointed out that in 2006 the richest one - tenth of American families accounted for 49.7 percent of all income that year , the highest share since 1917 .
From 1993 to 2006 , the top 1 percent of American families captured about half of the nation 's overall income growth , and from 2002 to 2006 " the top 1 percent captured almost three - quarters of income growth . "
( " Striking it Richer : The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States " )
The notion that the vast majority of the American people ‘ went along for the ride ' and feasted ‘ on easy money ' alongside investment bankers , hedge fund managers and Wall Street brokers is libelous and absurd .
Bernie Madoff or John Thain as Everyman ?
Apart from the fact that such lucrative opportunities were not open to ' regular Americans ' if they had wanted to take advantage of them , there is both a social and a moral divide in the US .
The financial swindlers at the top of American society do not speak to the average moral level of the country .
Most Americans do not spend every waking moment devising means of accumulating greater personal wealth ; they donate money to charity , they volunteer , they help others and they care for their families .
As for the accumulation of debt , this was not some collective act of recklessness or immaturity , as it was in fact a desperate effort by millions of families to keep their heads above water .
As former secretary of labor Robert Reich has pointed out , working class and middle class families tried numerous " coping mechanisms " over the course of decades to get by on stagnating or declining incomes .
Reich pointed out in the Financial Times a year ago , " Male wages today are in fact lower than they were then [ in 1970 ] : the income of a young man in his 30s is now 12 per cent below that of a man his age three decades ago . "
The first " coping mechanism " was " moving more women into work . "
A second was working longer :
The average American works two weeks more each year than 30 years ago and 350 more hours a year than the typical European .
The third such mechanism was borrowing and raising money through home equity loans .
Reich pointed out , " Americans got nearly $ 250 billion worth of home equity every quarter in second mortgages and refinancings . "
Astronomical credit card debt is an expression of the same phenomenon .
Last winter , some 27 million Americans had to borrow money simply to pay their heating bills .
Well - heeled and complacent , Frank Rich is a million miles from this reality .
As the vast majority of Americans have endured a declining living standard , a small portion of society , those at the top and sections of the upper middle class , have done very well for themselves .
Is Rich in the same financial position as he was 20 years ago , as New York Times drama critic ?
Today , in addition to his pay at the Times , Rich writes books ( the film rights to one of which , Ghost Light , were acquired by Storyline Entertainment ) , pens articles for other publications , delivers lectures and , in May 2008 , became a ‘ creative consultant ' for HBO , the pay television network .
Under the Bush administration , Rich could sometimes be quite scathing .
His comments , however , were generally directed toward the most obvious excesses and stupidities of Bush and company , and never answered any of the more complex and fundamental questions about social development and politics in the US .
In the end , he personifies a flabby , self - indulgent liberalism .
Distant from the working class , circulating among the semi-intellectual and semi-serious in Manhattan , Rich has now determined that the American population must make " far larger sacrifices . "
He writes that " Obama could n't give us FDR 's first inaugural address because we are not yet where America was in 1933 . "
No , in fact , Obama gave the opposite of Roosevelt 's speech .
The 1933 speech was an explicit indictment of the financial aristocracy and an appeal to democratic and egalitarian traditions .
Obama 's speech evaded the issue of the real responsibility of specific class forces and invoked the mirage of collective responsibility .
The latter , as in post - war Germany , lets the genuinely guilty off the hook .
Rich imagines himself to be terribly progressive and sensitive to human problems .
In truth , he articulates the outlook of an increasingly narrow , self - centered layer .
Such people might be irritated at times that they could n't afford the condos and summer homes reserved for the top one - tenth of one percent of the population .
That fueled a degree of resentment , and they would n't mind seeing their social superiors taken down a notch or two .
But they have no interest in anything that smacks of socialism or serious wealth redistribution .
On the contrary , on the life - and - death social questions , they see eye - to - eye and make common cause with Obama and his policies of austerity for ‘ regular Americans . '
It 's not unexpected and not very edifying , except for the light it sheds on the increasingly reactionary social outlook of contemporary American liberalism .

One of the bigger complaints about T - Mobile ’s G1 , the first phone based on Google ’s Android platform , is that its touch screen does n’t use multi-touch , the technology which allows for a screen to accept multiple points of contact as simultaneous input .
Now we may know why .
Apple , which of course makes the signature multi- touch mobile device , the iPhone , apparently asked Google not to implement it , and Google agreed , an Android team member tells us .
Further , the Android team member went on to say that they were relieved that Google did n’t go against Apple ’s wishes , given the legal storm that appears to be brewing between Apple and Palm , which is using multi - touch technology in its new Pre phone .
Even if Apple ultimately decides not to pursue legal action against Palm ( it ’s not yet clear how likely that is , but Apple does have an impressive array of patents ) , the situation has likely soured the relationship between the two companies .
Google , it seems , wants no part in ruining its relationship with Apple .
And that makes sense .
While the connection between Apple and Palm would seem like it should be strong , given how many former Apple employees now work at Palm , Google and Apple are actually more aligned .
Not only does Google specially tailor a ton of its products for the iPhone ( both with apps like Maps and Google Search , and specially formatted webpages ) , but its chief executive , Eric Schmidt , is on Apple ’s board of directors .
And do n’t underestimate the fact that both share a chief rival : Microsoft .
Recent demonstrations ( video below ) have proven that the G1 ’s screen and Android are capable of handling multi-touch , so some people seemed confused that Google and HTC ( which makes the G1 ) would n’t implement it .
Now we know .
The larger question going forward is , will multi - touch become important enough that Google has to include it in Android ?
After all , there are going to be a ton of Android - based phones come out this year , many that just have large screens like the iPhone ( and get rid of the G1 ’s crappy keyboard ) .
You can bet there will be pressure on Google to include multi- touch support in Android — especially after the Pre comes out .
On an related side note , the Android team member also confirmed that Intel has a massive effort underway related to Android .
We reported at the end of last month that Intel was prepping to help with a large rollout of Android - based netbooks , possibly as soon as this year .
It ’s still not entirely clear what specifically Intel is doing on its end , but despite what some may think , it is heavily involved , our source contends .
Intel has been backing the Moblin project ( mobile Linux ) , and it has now shifted its focus onto Netbooks for this year , jkOnTheRun ’s Kevin Tofel noted recently .
It seems that in some way it wants to be involved with Android too ( though , Tofel noted in our comments on the other post that Android likely runs better on ARM architecture rather than Intel’s ) .
Our source confirmed that many different Android netbooks , as well as other Android - based projects are in the works .
And that China is a hotbed for Android - based activity right now .

If Madoff is found guilty , he needs to spend the rest of his life behind bars .
Sickening .
Nobody knows depravity like Elie Wiesel knows depravity .
And does he ever see it in Bernie Madoff .
Wiesel , whose charitable foundation was wiped out by Madoff , has until now mostly kept quiet about the alleged $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .
But today , the Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize recipient spoke passionately about his betrayal by Madoff , whom he referred to variously as “ a crook , a thief , a scoundrel , ” as well as a “ swindler ” and “ evil . ”
Wiesel acknowledged that in addition to having lost his foundation ’s assets , he lost his personal wealth to Madoff .
“ All of a sudden , everything we have done in forty years–literally , my books , my lectures , my university salary , everything — was gone , ” he said during a panel discussion hosted by Condé Nast Portfolio .
His foundation , the Elie Wiesel Foundaton for Humanity , lost substantially all of its $ 15.2 million in assets to Madoff ; including his personal investments , total losses may be as high as $ 37 million .
“ We gave him everything , we thought he was God , we trusted everything in his hands , ” Wiesel said .
After US Airways Flight 1549 crash - landed in the Hudson River in New York last month , flight attendant Doreen Welsh , stationed in the back of the A320 jetliner , tried to close an emergency exit opened by a passenger , allowing water to rush in .
According to an interview aired Sunday on CBS News's " 60 Minutes , " Ms. Welsh said after a passenger " came back and pushed me back and opened the door , " garbage cans and coffee pots " were floating " and " things were flying .
It was crazy back there . "

I love the idea of Rush as the new GOP leader .
He 's really the kind of leader they deserve - he embodies their core ignorant values , he is a * cough * eloquent speaker , he really " fires up the base " , etc. ( if people like Limbaugh and Palin fire up your base .. there 's a problem with your base ! ) .

You know what , s been bugging me for several years now , did n't people used to get prosecuted by the fcc for knowingly spreading lies and hate on our public airwaves ?

Rush is n't the problem .
As I watch rush I can tell even he does n't buy 95 % of his own bullshit .
The sad part though is millions of americans do n't see through the complete and utter bullshit that is a typical rush broadcast , and they actually buy the rhetoric .
Rush is n't the problem , idiotic americans are the problem .
Rush is filling a niche , and that niche is broadcasting hate and narrominded partisanship to dullwitted hateful americans .
He makes a fortune lying to them every single day .
He should be taken to court more often though for his libel and slander , but he 's usually shrewd enough to do it in a manner which would keep his ass out of jail .
Even if he pays a few fines , they 're nothing compared to the millions he makes spreading deceit and hate .
Even sadder than the idiotic americans that listen to him is that there are so many companies willing to pay to advertise on his show .
But I guess that makes sense , if you buy into rush 's bullshit , you 'll probably buy into advertising propaganda as well .

I was pitched headfirst into the world of e-books in 2002 when I took a job with Palm Digital Media .
The company , originally called Peanut Press , was founded in 1998 with a simple plan : publish books in electronic form .
As it turns out , that simple plan leads directly into a technological , economic , and political hornet 's nest .
But thanks to some good initial decisions ( more on those later ) , little Peanut Press did pretty well for itself in those first few years , eventually having a legitimate claim to its self - declared title of " the world 's largest e-book store . "
Unfortunately , despite starting the company near the peak of the original dot - com bubble , the founders of Peanut Press lost control of the company very early on .
In retrospect , this signaled an important truth that persists to this day : people do n't get e-books .
A succession of increasingly disengaged and ( later ) incompetent owners effectively killed Peanut Press , first flattening its growth curve , then abandoning all of the original employees by moving the company several hundred miles away .
In January of 2008 , what remained of the once - proud e-book store ( now called eReader.com ) was scraped up off the floor and acquired by a competitor , Fictionwise.com .
Unlike previous owners , Fictionwise has some actual knowledge of and interest in e-books .
But though the " world 's largest e-book store " appellation still adorns the eReader.com website , larger fish have long since entered the pond .
And so , a sad end for the eReader that I knew ( née Palm Digital Media , née Peanut Press ) .
But this story is not just about them , or me .
Notice that I used the present tense earlier : " people do n't get e-books . "
This is as true today as it was ten years ago .
Venture capitalists did n't get it then , nor did the series of owners that killed Peanut Press , nor do many of the players in the e-book market today .
And then there are the consumers , their own notions about e-books left to solidify in the absence of any clear vision from the industry .
The sentiment seeping through the paragraphs above should seem familiar to most Ars Technica readers .
Do you detect a faint whiff of OS / 2 ?
Amiga , perhaps ?
Or , more likely , the overwhelming miasma of " Mac user , circa 1996 . "
That 's right , it 's the defiance and bitterness of the marginalized : those who feel that their particular passion has been unjustly shunned by the ignorant masses .
Usually , this sentiment marks the tail end of a movement , or a product in decline .
But sometimes it 's just a sign of a slow start .
I believe this is the case with e-books .
The pace of the e-book market over the past decade has been excruciatingly — and yes , you guessed it , unjustly — slow .
My frustration is much like that of the Mac users of old .
Here 's an awesome , obvious , inevitable idea , seemingly thwarted at every turn by widespread consumer misunderstanding and an endemic lack of will among the big players .
I do n't pretend to be able to move corporate mountains , but I do have a lot of e-book related things to get off my chest .
And so , this will be part editorial , part polemic , part rant , but also , I hope , somewhat educational .
As for Apple , that connection will be clear by the end , if it is n't already .
Buckle up .
In a filling with the US Copyright Office , Mozilla and Skype have added their voices of support to a request by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for an exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act related to iPhone jailbreaking .
The exemption would strip Apple of its ability to charge groups with DMCA violations for circumventing the iPhone 's security by modifying Apple 's internal iPhone software , as long as they did it under the cover of " enabling interoperability , " according to the exemption wording proposed by the EFF .
The jailbreak arguments
Users can already bypass Apple 's security system by jailbreaking their iPhones using freely available software .
This allows the users to run software that Apple does not allow in its App Store .
It also allows users to bootleg pirated iPhone software , strips the iPhone of any functional protection from malware , and complicates Apple 's ability to release software updates , as the modified firmware on jailbroken phones can result in failed software updates that render the phone unreliable or even unusable until it is restored back to factory default settings .
Speaking for the EFF , Fred von Lohmann has called Apple 's argument against the exemption " FUD , " " corporate paternalism , " and " absurdity . "
Apple 's fillings say the EFF's new exemption request is unnecessary , as the DMCA already has provisions that allow circumvention to enable interoperability .
It also claims the EFF is merely trying to use the courts to attack its unique business model , and that the EFF does not present any evidence to back up its claims that legitimizing jailbreaking would result in increased innovation .
Few software companies offer iPhone titles that require jailbreaking , in part because of the grey area under the shadow of threat of a DMCA violation charge from Apple , and in part because of the lack of any profit motive behind distributing software outside of the App Store , where Apple 's DRM creates a viable market for mobile software .
For developers who can't sell their titles in the App Store , it 's an entirely different story however .
Mozilla wants freedom , but wo n't go on the iPhone
Mozilla insists that Apple would probably not allow it to offer a mobile version of Firefox for the iPhone , based on its reading of the iPhone SDK , which forbids the installation of alternative runtimes .
It has neither submitted Firefox nor has it been officially denied a listing by Apple .
A Computerworld report filed by Gregg Keizer quoted Mozilla 's CEO , John Lilly , as saying , " The [ iPhone ] SDK is very clear , that Flash and Firefox and other runtimes are not welcome on the iPhone . "
However , the report also noted that Lilly " said he doubts Mozilla would venture into the iPhone even if the Copyright Office grants the DMCA exemption over jailbreaking . "
Mozilla 's mobile version of Firefox , called Fennec , aims to compete against mobile browsers based on Web Kit , including Apple 's Mobile Safari and web browsers developed by Nokia , Google for Android , Palm for its upcoming Pre , and RIM for the BlackBerry Storm .
Apple claims in its filing with the Copyright Office that alternative apps which compete with Apple 's own software are allowed as long as they meet the other requirements of the SDK .
It even specifically cites web browsers ; the App Store reveals a handful of alternative web browsers that are already available for download .
Most appear to be alternative interfaces to Safari which use the WebKit rendering engine , but at least one appears to use its own .
Skype 's missed connection
Skype , which is owned by eBay , a prominent early adopter in iPhone software development , also joined in to endorse the EFF 's exemption request , stating " copyright law should not interfere with a user using his or her phone to run Skype and enjoy the benefits of low - or no-cost long - distance and international calling . "
However , Apple does not prevent VoIP applications on the iPhone , as long as they use WiFi .
The App Store lists a variety of VoIP apps , but Skype currently does not offer an iPhone version of its software .
Unclear intent
If allowed , the EFF 's exemption might make it easier for companies that want to offer an alternative to the App Store , including the jailbreak software download tool Cydia , which also filed a comment supporting the EFF 's proposal .
The DMCA exemption would not stop Apple from filing a copyright infringement case against groups who modify and distribute its software however .
The DMCA only relates to the circumvention of security measures that control access to copyright material .
Bypassing security does n't remove copyright .
It also does n't invalidate Apple 's software license or SDK , both of which forbid modifying Apple 's internal software .
A DMCA exemption would only make it far more difficult for Apple to pursue known pirates .
Apple has n't yet filed or even threatened to file DMCA complaints against any groups or individuals involved in jailbreaking .
Instead , the company has focused on making the App Store attractive enough to render jailbreaking superfluous and irrelevant to most users .
Since the release of the iPhone 2.0 SDK , interest in jailbreaking has waned considerably .

I had always falsely assumed that the animated Sugar Bear character was created just for commercials , but this is n’t the case as it turns out that he got his start on Saturday morning TV in 1963 .
He was featured in the cartoon Linus the Lionhearted which crossed the now unimaginable line of having advertising characters ( pushing junk food no less ) appear on regular cartoons aimed at kids .
Also it turns out that Sugar Bear was based on Dean Martin which explains his demeanor — I guess I could see Sugar Bear drinking a martini and starring in a Matt Helm movie .
Below is some cool concept art from 1965 after the character premiered on TV :
Although it should be noted that my favorite sugar pushing Ursoidea had an earlier incarnation in the 50s as seen in this box art from 1962 which had the previous character design :

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Fires whipped up by hot hurricane force gusts ringed Los Angeles on Saturday , charring thousands of acres and hundreds of homes in California ’s largest city and threatening the city ’s power supply .
More than 10,000 residents were under mandatory evacuation orders as a fire that exploded overnight in the foothills of the Angeles National Forest barreled into the San Fernando Valley and burned more than 6,500 acres .
The dry Santa Ana winds sweeping in from the desert fanned the fire in the foothills near Sylmar that Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said had destroyed more homes than any other in the past decade .
Villaraigosa urged residents near Sylmar to leave quickly if they were in harm ’s way .
“ If you wait until the fire gets there you have waited too long ...
This fire can be on you in a moment ’s notice . ”
“ We ’re at the mercy of the wind .
Mother Nature ’s not been too good to us for the last 15 hours , ” he said later .
The fire raged on both sides of Interstate 5 , the main freeway connecting Los Angeles with the north , and the path of transmission lines bringing power to the city of 10 million .
Two of the five main transmission lines had to be taken down because of damage to a converting station , and a third power line was directly damaged by heat , causing 115,000 customers to be without power for 45 minutes .
A separate fire flared south of Los Angeles in Orange County on Saturday morning , charring more than 800 acres and destroying at least 10 structures in the communities of Yorba Linda and Corona , south of Los Angeles .
And , further up the coast near Santa Barbara , firefighters continued to battle the two - day - old blaze in the celebrity enclave of Montecito , where 111 homes have been destroyed .
About 40 percent had been contained , a spokesman said .
Northwest of Los Angeles , police closed down Interstate 5 and other roads as 600 firefighters mobilized to fight the Sylmar fire .
About 10 percent of the fire has been contained , Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Ron Haralson said Saturday afternoon .
Mountains were engulfed in flames and billows of smoke were visible from space by weather satellite .
Steady gale - force winds , blowing at 35 mph , periodically gusted up to 75 mph and spread the fire .
A map of the fire is at tinyurl.com / sayrefire .
About 300 people , many of them residents of the Oakridge Mobile Home Park where homes burned to the ground , gathered in the Sylmar High School , where the American Red Cross had set up relief services .
“ You could see absolutely nothing , ” said Jackie Burns , 77 , who , along with her husband , Len , fled their mobile home at 3 a.m. as the fire raged through the neighborhood .
“ It was like looking into a black hole .
It looked like the end of the world to me . ”

Some evacuees sobbed as Los Angeles Fire Department Captain Steve Ruda told them the fire had burned down most of the 600 pre-fabricated homes in the mobile park .
“ It was an absolute firestorm , ” he said .
“ Firefighters were braving 50 - foot flame lengths as they swept across the mobile homes . ”
Heat from the flames also melted firefighters ’ hoses to the pavement , he said .
An additional 24 homes and 10 commercial structures have been damaged or destroyed , Haralson said .

DRY CONDITIONS ‘PERFECT FOR MORE ’
California ’s fire season , which traditionally starts in June , has been lengthening and getting worse as the dry state adds homes in fringe areas prone to flames .
Los Angeles , which is home to nearly 10 million people , has been largely spared damage this year .
In October of last year 30 blazes raged across Southern California , forcing evacuation of more than 500,000 people and damaging some 2,000 homes .
Marie Larsen , 70 , another evacuee who took refuge at the Sylmar school , said she grabbed her suitcase -- still packed from a month ago when she fled her home during the Sesnon fire -- and left after six police officers banged on her door .
The Los Angeles area remains on alert for more fires , said Daniel Berlant , a spokesman at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .
“ It ’s the dry conditions that make it perfect for more fires , ” he said .
SKY MAP : Just before dawn local on Feb. 22 , Jupiter and Mercury will be easy to find using the moon as a guide .
Mars will require binoculars .
This month you 'll have an opportunity to see all five naked - eye planets – but not all at once .
Two of them are evening objects , while the other three are clustered together low in the east - southeast sky deep in the dawn twilight .
The planets move around in our sky and become brighter and dimmer over time depending on where they are in their orbits around the sun .
Uranus , Neptune and Pluto are never visible to the naked eye .
Here 's what you can look for :
The Evening Lantern
If you ever wanted to see a planet so bright it will take your breath away , this is your week and Venus is the planet .
It hangs lantern - like , high in the west as darkness falls .
It 's so bright now that you should have little trouble finding it even before sunset in a clean , deep blue sky – which is also a good time to look at its dramatic crescent shape in a telescope .
As dusk starts to fade , this unrivaled heavenly lamp can scarcely be missed — you wo n't need a map .
Venus sets more than 3 hours after the sun .
Venus is now at the pinnacle of brilliancy for this current evening apparition .
Viewed through a telescope in the coming weeks , its crescent grows larger but thinner as the planet approaches the Earth in the celestial scheme of things and shows us more of its night side .
By month 's end Venus is similar in apparent size to Jupiter – but less than one - quarter of it is lit .
Gray markings in the planet 's cloud cover remain quite subtle .
Look around sunset , when the sky is brighter and Venus 's crescent is less dazzling than it becomes after dark .
Also , watch for signs of the mysterious ashen light – a still unexplained illumination that some observers have occasionally noticed in parts of Venus 's night side .
On the evening of Feb. 27 the Americas will be greeted with one of the most spectacular Venus - crescent moon conjunctions possible .
The pairing will persist from before sunset into the depths of darkness .
Venus will sit about 1.5 - degrees above and to the right of the three - day old crescent .
Be sure not to miss this !
Lord of the Rings
The next planet to look for is Saturn .
This week it comes up above the eastern horizon about 90 minutes after sunset , but by the time of its opposition to the sun on March 8 it will be visible all night from dusk to dawn .
Two nights later , on March 10 , Saturn will ride high above the full moon .
Brightening slightly from magnitude +0.7 to +0.5 , Saturn appears twice as bright as the bluish star , Regulus , the brightest star of Leo , the Lion .
Shining sedately with a yellow - white hue , Saturn appears far to the lower left of that first magnitude star during the evening .
If you have a telescope magnifying at least 30 - power , you 'll be able to glimpse the famous ring system , which now looks like a bright line that bisects Saturn 's disk .
The rings open slightly to 2.3 - degrees from edgewise by the end of February , but the rings will start closing again later this spring , ultimately disappearing even in big telescopes by midsummer .
A planetary trio
The other three planets visible are morning objects .
Two of these are visible toward month 's end but with some difficulty : Jupiter and Mercury .
Solar conjunction for Jupiter was on Jan. 24 ; by the final week of February it 'll be on its way back into view , appearing a little higher each day .
Off to its upper right will be fainter Mercury .
Bring binoculars for this challenging sighting ; the two planets will be very low above the east - southeastern horizon about 30 - 35 minutes before sunrise .
Just before sunrise on the 22nd , seek out the slender sliver of an old crescent moon , just 2 - ½ days before new phase , low near the east - southeast horizon .
If you find it , use it as your guide to locate Mercury and Jupiter , located about 5 or 6 - degrees to the moon 's lower left .
Binoculars will help .
Jupiter and Mercury engage in a close conjunction early on the morning of Feb. 24 , with Jupiter appearing to stand almost directly above Mercury ; they 're separated by 0.7 - degree .
For comparison , the moon 's apparent width is 0.5 - degree .
The place to look is very low in the east - southeast .
Mercury shines at a respectable magnitude - 0.1 , but still appears only about one - sixth as bright as Jupiter 's - 2.0 .
The only planet seemingly out of the loop in terms of visibility is Mars .
Shining at magnitude + 1.3 and rising deep in the glow of dawn less than an hour before sunup , it 's not yet a naked - eye object for mid-northerners .
Nonetheless , on the mornings of Feb. 16 , 17 and 18 , Mars and Jupiter will be separated by less than 1 - degree .
On the 17th , in fact , Jupiter will appear just 0.6 - degree to the upper left of Mars .
So if you can locate Jupiter , you should be able to find Mars with binoculars or a small telescope .
And with Mercury close by this makes for a planetary trio .
For those Space.com readers living south of the equator , these three planets will appear a bit higher and against a somewhat darker sky ; hence making them easier to see .

Amnesty International on Tuesday accused Hamas of waging a campaign to kill or maim scores of Palestinian opponents in the Gaza Strip since the end of December .
Rocket Fire Palestinian FM : Hamas attacks tied to elections AP and Ali Waked Riad Malki suggests rockets continue to be launched from Gaza Strip as ' a way to interfere ' in Israeli vote , says Palestinian group ' wants instability in the region ' .
He also stresses PA willing to negotiate with new Israeli leadership Palestinian FM : Hamas attacks tied to elections
The human rights group said in a report that at least two dozen men have been shot dead by gunmen from the Palestinian militia that governs the Gaza Strip since December 27 .
" Scores of others have been shot in the legs , knee - capped or inflicted with other injuries intended to cause severe disability , subjected to severe beatings ... or otherwise tortured or ill - treated , " it added .
" Hamas forces and militias in the Gaza Strip have engaged in a campaign of abductions , deliberate and unlawful killings , torture and death threats against those they accuse of ' collaborating ' with Israel , as well as opponents and critics , " the report said .
The victims included members of Palestinian Authority security forces and members of Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas ' Fatah party , Amnesty said .
The campaign began shortly after the beginning of the three - week Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip on December 27 and continued after the ceasefire on January 18 , according to Amnesty .
' Perpetrators did not conceal their weapons '
Palestinian human rights groups and victims first made such accusations at the end of last month , saying the Hamas rulers of Gaza were persecuting members of the rival Fatah movement to quash any opposition .
Taher al Nunu , a spokesman for Hamas , denied the charges at the time , dismissing them as " lies spread by Ramallah , " where Abbas and the Palestinian Authority are based .
Amnesty International said the targets included former detainees who were accused by Hamas of collaboration with Israel after escaping from Gaza 's central prison when it was bombed by Israeli forces on December 28 .
Some were shot dead in hospitals where they were being treated for injuries suffered during the bombing raid , sometimes in front of distraught relatives , according to the testimony gathered by the human rights group .
" The perpetrators of these attacks did not conceal their weapons or keep a low profile , but , on the contrary , behaved in a carefree and confident - almost ostentatious - manner , " the report noted .
Amnesty said there was " no doubt " that the victims were abducted , killed , shot and tortured by Hamas security forces and armed militias , adding that the evidence was " incontrovertible . "
It called on the " Hamas de facto administration " to immediately end the campaign , accept an independent and impartial investigation and guarantee that victims and witnesses would not be targeted .
The legal fight over accountability for a day - care center housed in a former mercury thermometer factory continues in New Jersey , with plenty of buck - passing and legal maneuvering by the owner of the property .
[ social_buttons ]
The real estate broker , Jim Sullivan III , who bought the contaminated building and later rented it out as a day - care center says that he did not believe a cleanup was necessary .
He also never informed the operators of the day care of its history .
Convenient for him , huh ?
A class action lawsuit was brought against Sullivan by attorneys representing nearly 100 children who attended the Franklinville day care before it closed in July 2006 .
Testing revealed that it contained hazardous vapors , and beads of mercury were found in cracks of the floors and ceiling joists .
The first trial , scheduled for February 18 , will focus on Sullivan ’s defense that he and other family members do not legally own the building .
They claim that the title should be voided due to discrepancies in paperwork , and said that the municipal and state Department of Environmental Protection did not properly notify them of the toxic condition of the building .
I say that ’s a bunch of bullshit .
They owned the building enough to rent it out , did n’t they ?
They knew it was a former mercury thermometer factory , did n’t they ?
Sullivan says that his father set up Navillus Group General Partnership for him and his three siblings , and Navillus then bought the tax - sale certificate for the property .
He also claims that the attorney who filled out the paperwork did not put the partnership name on the forms , but instead put Navillus LLC .
Sullivan ’s argument is that the LLC does not exist .
“ I ’m not sure how that all got confused .
I ’ve read in the litigation about all of the confusion of all of that .
I do n’t know the legal differences between the two [ a partnership and a limited liability corporation ] . ” – Sullivan
Wait a minute .
A licensed real estate broker and appraiser does not know the difference between a partnership and an LLC ?
The b.s. is getting deep …
Sullivan also said that he was given a copy of a 1996 “ Mini Pollution Report . ”
In that report , prepared by the EPA , investigators said that droplets of mercury were found on the floor and detected on the walls .
Yet no further cleanup was done .
Why ?
The day care , Kiddie Kollege , was operated for over two years before being shut down .
Five days a week , ten hours a day , kids were exposed to mercury , and now the owner wants to claim that he does n’t really own it .
Bullshit .
If this guy gets off with a slap on the wrist , it will be another victory for weasels disguised as attorneys and another loss for parents who trust the system .
I say let ’s slip a little of that mercury into Jimmy - boy ’s bed and claim we did n’t know it was toxic …

Sometimes , it seems like Paul Krugman is the only one who gets it .
Admittedly , I ’m a huge fan , but it seems like Krugman , not Geither and Summers , is the economic mind that can save our economy .
He sure nails the absurdity of the current situation :
A not - so - funny thing happened on the way to economic recovery .
Over the last two weeks , what should have been a deadly serious debate about how to save an economy in desperate straits turned , instead , into hackneyed political theater , with Republicans spouting all the old clichés about wasteful government spending and the wonders of tax cuts .
It ’s as if the dismal economic failure of the last eight years never happened — yet Democrats have , incredibly , been on the defensive .
Even if a major stimulus bill does pass the Senate , there ’s a real risk that important parts of the original plan , especially aid to state and local governments , will have been emasculated .
Somehow , Washington has lost any sense of what ’s at stake — of the reality that we may well be falling into an economic abyss , and that if we do , it will be very hard to get out again .
As one of my friends messaged me today , “ it ’s like the Republicans won the election . ”
How did the Democrats let that happen ?
What ’s important now is solving the problem .
Of course , Krugman has sage advice there , too .
Obama would do well to listen to Paul Krugman right now and not his high paid political consultants and advisers who came up with that failed plan to get 80 votes in the Senate , which actually just empowered the Republicans .
“ The Obama strategists ” who leaked that to the Politico last month are idiots .
That not only did n’t work , it ’s been a disaster .
Americans need leadership from our president and Krugman has a strategy :
So what should Mr. Obama do ?
Count me among those who think that the president made a big mistake in his initial approach , that his attempts to transcend partisanship ended up empowering politicians who take their marching orders from Rush Limbaugh .
What matters now , however , is what he does next .
It ’s time for Mr. Obama to go on the offensive .
Above all , he must not shy away from pointing out that those who stand in the way of his plan , in the name of a discredited economic philosophy , are putting the nation ’s future at risk .
The American economy is on the edge of catastrophe , and much of the Republican Party is trying to push it over that edge .
Obama started to do that yesterday .
Our president needs to go all out now — just like he did during the campaign .
He ’s fighting against the same failed policies now that he fought in the fall .
But , now the situation is even more dire — and Obama has to fix it .
Last night , at the Democratic House Caucus retreat , Obama sounded pretty riled up .
Here ’s an excerpt from the White House transcript :
But what I have also said is — do n’t come to the table with the same tired arguments and worn ideas that helped to create this crisis .
( Applause . )
You know , all of us here — imperfect .
And everything we do and everything I do is subject to improvement .
Michelle reminds me every day how imperfect I am . ( Laughter . )
So I welcome this debate .
But come on , we ’re not — we are not going to get relief by turning back to the very same policies that for the last eight years doubled the national debt and threw our economy into a tailspin .
( Applause . )
We ca n’t embrace the losing formula that says only tax cuts will work for every problem we face ; that ignores critical challenges like our addiction to foreign oil , or the soaring cost of health care , or falling schools and crumbling bridges and roads and levees .
I do n’t care whether you ’re driving a hybrid or an SUV — if you ’re headed for a cliff , you ’ve got to change direction .
( Applause . )
That ’s what the American people called for in November , and that ’s what we intend to deliver .
( Applause . )
So the American people are watching .
They did not send us here to get bogged down with the same old delay , the same old distractions , the same talking points , the same cable chatter .
( Applause . )
You know , are n’t you all tired of that stuff ?
Yes , we are tired of the same old Republican stuff and the same painful cable chatter .
That ’s the Obama we need to see .
With the horrible news about unemployment this morning , he ’s got no time to lose .
Yet , here we find ourselves more than 222 years later in the midst of a newspaper crisis that TIME magazine says has reached " meltdown proportions , " meaning our transformation into wolves and sheep may soon be a foregone conclusion , and still the majority of the American public appears oblivious .
Wolves and sheep .
You do n't have to be a Jeffersonian scholar to comprehend what it means .
Those words appeared in Jefferson 's letter to Edward Carrington , a Virginia statesman who was serving as a delegate to the Continental Congress .
In it , Jefferson went on to say that , without newspapers , he feared the American public would stop paying attention to their government .
Once that happened it was only a matter of time before Jefferson , the Congress , and the whole of the American government turned into a pack of wolves preying upon sheep .
It was , Jefferson figured , the result of the public 's inattention , an inevitability wherever government was permitted to exist absent a free press .
Cloaked in the garb of government , Jefferson wrote , the leaders of Europe had managed to divide their nations into two distinct classes -- " wolves and sheep " -- with the ruling class preying upon everyone else .
Odd as that may sound today considering all the good he did his country , Jefferson worried about the possibility , so much so that , while on a trip to Europe in 1787 , one of his letters home became a kind of dissertation about the people he'd seen transformed into " wolves and sheep " along the way .
Thomas Jefferson did not wish to become a wolf .
Many newspapers have closed .
Buyouts and layoffs have decimated once great institutions of American journalism .
And despite all that , some of the craziest last - ditch efforts you ever could have imagined are being implemented in the effort to stave off death .
- The Los Angeles Times has killed its local news section .
- The Gannett newspaper chain has put its newspaper employees on mandatory five - day furloughs .
- The Detroit New and The Detroit Free Press have ceased daily home delivery .
These are n't sane measures .
Indeed , had anyone suggested such things two years ago they'd have been branded a lunatic .
But as we approach panic mode , even remotely plausible ideas seem worth a shot .
TIME magazine 's cover story this week , a very thought - provoking piece written by Walter Isaacson ( a former TIME managing editor , and president and CEO of the Aspen Institute ) , suggests the solution may be to charge readers for access :
" Under a micropayment system , a newspaper might decide to charge a nickel for an article or a dime for that day 's full edition or $ 2 for a month 's worth of Web access .
Some surfers would balk , but I suspect most would merrily click through if it were cheap and easy enough . "
Simple enough , except that , as Isaacson points out , it 's not new .
Writers have been charging readers for news since paper put cave walls out of business , but , despite that , prior attempts to make readers pay in the wired world of the World Wide Web have n't gone over very well .
Which brings us right back to where we 've been for years while , in the meantime , another newspaper ( Denver 's Rocky Mountain News ) rages against the dying of the light .
No more .
It 's time to do something drastic .
It 's time to do more than join another Facebook pledge group , or promote a campaign like National Buy A Newspaper Day , or to purchase some overpriced t- shirts emblazoned with the message " Save a journalist , buy a newspaper . "
It 's time to admit that , regardless of how many readers may be clicking through newspaper content for free on the Internet , newspapers do n't matter to those readers because Jefferson 's concerns are n't on their radar .
They 've got enough to worry about .
They 've got jobs of their own .
They 've got this much time to read blog X , Y and Z , and click their way over to the paper and back , or not , or whatever , but there 's no compelling reason for them to stop and think about what would happen if the newspapers providing all that news ceased to exist .
To the average reader wolves and sheep are little more than characters in a fairy tale .
It 's not that Americans do n't care .
It 's simply a matter of human nature .
Until the discomfort reaches the readers -- at which point it will be too late -- there 's no motivation for them to get involved in finding a solution .
Clearly newspapers can't solve this alone .
They 've had years .
They 're lost .
And , at this stage , asking for directions is n't enough to put them back on track .
Now is the time for newspapers to do something proactive ; time for them to demonstrate what life would be like without them .
It 's time for every daily newspaper in the United States , in cooperation with the Associated Press , to shut down their free Web sites for one week .
Yes .
Shut it down .
Blank screen .
Nothing .
Of course , news would still be reported daily in every newspaper 's printed product .
No editor , or reporter or publication would dare shirk their watchdog responsibilities .
This is n't about stopping the presses .
But the Web ?
People can do without news on the Web for a week .
They wo n't like it .
They 'll complain about it .
But , that 's exactly what has to happen before they can be expected to care .
Pulling the plug gets their attention .
So , here 's the proposal :
At the stroke of midnight on Independence Day , Saturday July 4 , all daily newspapers ought to switch off their Web sites until Friday , July 10 .
Call it " A Week Without a Virtual Newspaper . "
Call it crazy .
Call it costly .
Call it whatever you want , but it's no more drastic a measure than asking people to work for free .
A move like this puts the crisis where it ought to be , front and center at the top of every newscast .
It makes it impossible for anyone to deny where the majority of news content comes from , and why it matters .
For without virtual newspapers , what would Drudge report ?
What would Huffington post ?
What would Google News and Yahoo News and all those cut - and - paste blogs that get so much of their material from newspapers have to offer if newspapers went away ?
Not that there 's anything wrong with public affairs blogs , aggregate news sites , or any other online entity that makes use of newspaper reports .
The point of pulling the plug for one week is n't to harm them , but to emphasize the origin of all that news content , and why everyone should care about protecting that source .
Pulling the plug is perhaps the only way to make people outside of journalism sit up and take notice that this is n't about jobs in journalism , but American Democracy .
It 's about wolves and sheep .
Wolves and sheep .

Big Budget Events
If you are dumbfounded by the amount of money the federal government is pouring into the private sector to ease the nation 's financial crisis , it 's worth a look at how much Uncle Sam has spent on other major projects and historic events in the past , such as wars , bailouts and engineering marvels .
Thus far , only one item surpasses the $ 700 billion allocated to the government 's main rescue fund , what 's known as the Treasury Dept . 's TARP program .
Other expenses and / or commitments , from Federal Reserve lending and guarantees to FDIC insurance fund losses to complex financial market mechanism , put the total cost at some $ 3.8 trillion ( as of Oct. 23 ) .

World War II
Feb. 19 , 2009 --
The FDA today approved use of an implanted brain device for patients with severe obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) .
The device is Medtronic 's Reclaim deep - brain stimulation ( DBS ) device .
It will be used as a last - ditch therapy to treat patients who have failed multiple different therapies for OCD .
" This is essentially like a pacemaker for the brain , " Hackensack University Medical Center neurosurgeon Hooman Azmi , MD , tells WebMD .
" There is an electrode implanted in brain and wires run under the skin and attached to a generator that is also implanted in the body .
And doctors have control where they can decrease or increase the electrical stimulation . "
The FDA 's " humanitarian device exemption " permits use of the device on only the most severely ill people with OCD .
Fewer than 4,000 patients have such drastic , treatment - resistant OCD .
The decision is based on a clinical study of 26 patients at three U.S. medical centers .
" DBS is a promising treatment for a subset of patients with OCD who have remained very ill and debilitated despite aggressive use of medications and cognitive behavioral therapy , " study leader Benjamin D. Greenberg , MD , PhD , said in a news release .
Because implantation of the device carries serious risks , the treatment is n't for most OCD sufferers , says Azmi , who is familiar with the details of the clinical study but was not involved in it .
" The patients they looked at are really the most ill of the ill .
They have so much disability from OCD that they really have lost all of what we would consider a life , " Azmi says .
" They have become unable to work .
Some cannot hold on to any relationships ; some cannot even leave the house . "
Patients in the Greenberg study showed remarkable improvement .
" Some could go back to work , some could again have relationships and participate in life , " Azmi says .
" And more important , some of the patients could participate in behavior therapy as well , and that likely had a role in their overall progress . "
There were also serious risks .
Eleven of the 26 patients suffered a total of 23 serious adverse events .
Fortunately , all resolved without lasting damage .
But the procedure carries a risk of life - threatening cerebral hemorrhage and brain infection .
The treatment requires an interdisciplinary team of experts for selecting the right patients , implanting the device , adjusting the electrical stimulation to the brain , and managing patients over the long term .
The Reclaim DBS device is similar to devices used to treat Parkinson 's disease and other movement disorders .
However , because it stimulates a different part of the brain , Medtronic developed special electrodes for use in OCD .
The device is now being tested in patients with extremely severe depression in a U.S. trial .
