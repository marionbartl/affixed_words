BERLIN ( Reuters ) -
Three vast tunnels were opened under central Berlin this month , giving a glimpse of Adolf Hitler ’s megalomaniac vision of a new architectural centre for the capital of Nazi Germany .

The 16 - metre ( 50 - foot ) deep tunnels were constructed in 1938 as part of an underground transport network beneath a series of bombastic buildings designed by Nazi architect Albert Speer , including the biggest domed hall the world had ever seen .
The overground plans , never completed because of World War Two , included boulevards , squares and huge buildings , such as an arch dwarfing the Arc de Triomphe in Paris , and the 290 - metre high Great Hall , with room for 180,000 people .
Hitler called the concept , a symbol of the power of the Third Reich , “ Berlin -- the capital of the world ” but in recent times it has come to be known as “ Germania . ”
The tunnels , between 90 and 220 meters long lying beneath the Tiergarten park , would have accommodated roads and a railway line .
“ The tunnels -- which are in surprisingly good condition -- were part of Speer ’s grand plans , what we now call ‘ Germania ’ , ” historian Dietmar Arnold , head of the Berlin Underground Association and bunker tour guide , told Reuters .
Last week , Arnold -- who runs an exhibition of Hitler ’s plans -- took journalists on a rare visit into the dank tunnels .
They are closed to the public most of the time because of safety concerns , but visits can be arranged .
“ The acoustics are incredible , ” said Arnold , who likes singing a note and hearing it reverberate around him .
After the war , British forces in divided Berlin closed the tunnels .
They were rediscovered in 1969 but have remained shut .
In 1990 , a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall , they were handed to the city of Berlin .
The Berlin Underground Association , set up in 1997 , has seen a surge in interest in tours of Berlin ’s remaining bunkers .
Although most were destroyed , some of the maze of 1,000 World War Two bunkers are intact and serve as a reminder of the city ’s violent history .
Propaganda posters and escape instructions on the walls convey a sense of the past .
In one bunker , suitcases , helmets , and uniforms from various sites are on show .
“ Interest is constantly growing -- we have about 150,000 visitors a year to the bunkers , ” said Arnold .
“ That is partly why we want the bunkers to be protected -- they are an important part of the history of Berlin . ”
By the end of the war , Germany ’s most heavily bombed city could protect up to 800,000 people in its bunkers .

Salim Hamdan , Osama bin Laden 's personal driver , will enter a specially built courtroom in Guantanamo Bay tomorrow for the first full trial of any of the hundreds of detainees to have been sent to America 's infamous prison camp since the 9/11 attacks nearly seven years ago .
Instead of one of al - Qa'ida 's top leaders in captivity – such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed – the accused in the first US military tribunal since the Second World War is a 39 - year - old Yemeni , whose lawyers say he belongs on a psychiatric ward rather than in jail .
Heightening the irony , a military judge has overruled prosecutors and decided that Mr Hamdan 's lawyers can question the alleged mastermind of the September 2001 attacks and other possible witnesses about the driver .
The judge threatened to delay the trial if prosecutors did not arrange this over the weekend .
Even the US does not claim that the driver and sometime mechanic , who earned a mere $ 200 ( £ 100 ) a month , was a major terror figure .
But prosecutors allege that he carried weapons used by al - Qai'da and helped to spirit Bin Laden out of Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban .
If convicted , he could find himself in prison for life .

For many , however , it is the erosion of America 's historic liberties that will be on trial tomorrow .
The Bush administration created a system of detention without due process when it set up the Guantanamo prison camp in 2002 , a legal limbo in which hundreds of detainees – including Mr Hamdan , according to his lawyers – have suffered psychological and possibly physical torture .
The driver is alleged to have gone mad as a direct result of being kept in solitary confinement for 22 hours a day in a tiny cell ; he is hardly the ideal subject for the first major test of President George Bush 's much - criticised system of military commissions to bring terrorism suspects to justice .
Mr Hamdan left his home in Yemen in 1996 and tried to sign on as an Islamist fighter in Tajikistan , but could not get into the country .
The US says he went to Afghanistan instead , and ended up working for Bin Laden .
After the terror attacks on New York and Washington , Mr Hamdan drove al - Qa'ida 's supreme leader between safe houses to avoid US missiles , according to prosecutors , who say he broke away a month later and evacuated his daughter and pregnant wife from Kandahar in the midst of the invasion .
It is not only Mr Hamdan 's future that will be determined by the trial .
There is great concern among members of the Bush administration that they too could find themselves before foreign or international courts for the role they played in facilitating and encouraging the torture of detainees .
The infamous " torture memos " circulated by Vice - President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff , Charles Addington , and two former administration figures , Douglas Feith and Alberto Gonzales , covertly approved the abuse of prisoners by the CIA .
These men were publicly warned recently by Lawrence Wilkerson , chief of staff to Colin Powell when Mr Powell was Secretary of State , to " never travel outside the US , except perhaps to Saudi Arabia or Israel " .
One of the most explosive parts of the trial could be the efforts by the defence to show in coming weeks that Pentagon officials interfered with military prosecutors and pressed cases for strictly political reasons .
Hearings on that issue are expected to reveal how White House officials and aides of Mr Cheney were on the phone to Guantanamo – in a way , some claim , that made a mockery of American military justice .
The former chief Guantanamo prosecutor , Colonel Morris Davis , a harsh critic of the way the war crimes tribunal system is run , could even testify for Mr Hamdan .
Since the US designated its naval base at the tip of Cuba as a place to imprison some of its greatest enemies , about 800 people have been held at Guantanamo , and some 420 have been released back to their countries without charge .
The oldest known suspect imprisoned there was 95 - year - old Mohammed Sadiq from Afghanistan , who has been released .
The youngest is Omar Khadr , a Canadian citizen who was just 16 years old when he was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2002 .
A grainy video of a weeping Mr Khadr , who is still being held , emerged last week , providing an unprecedented glimpse into the harsh conditions at Guantanamo .
Now 21 , he was shown being interrogated for three days by Canadian intelligence agents after he had been tortured by sleep deprivation for three weeks .
The longest portion of the video , an eight - minute segment , shows a sobbing Mr Khadr , burying his head in his hands and moaning " Help me , help me " as the agents look on .

The footage , from a camera hidden behind a ventilation shaft , is the first video of a Guantanamo interrogation to become public .
It was obtained under court order by Mr Khadr 's Canadian lawyers , who want to bring him home .
But neither the US nor the Canadian government wants to see him released .
The US military accuses him of killing a soldier with a grenade and injuring another .
However , efforts to persuade military courts that he is an " enemy combatant " were thrown out last year .
As for Mr Hamdan , he is " small fry , a grunt , and Bush knows it " , said Marc Falkoff , a lawyer representing several other Yemeni detainees .
" But the administration was never going to bring one of its high - profile detainees out first when nobody quite knows what 's going to happen in this brand - new legal process . "
The military commissions were created to try people designated " unlawful enemy combatants " after the Supreme Court issued a stinging rebuke to the Bush administration in June 2006 for tearing up the Geneva Conventions on the conduct of war and denying the most basic right of habeas corpus to prisoners .
Despite the international clamour against Guantanamo , the US has charged only 20 of its prisoners , including Khalid Sheik Mohammed , who was tortured by " waterboarding " before arriving at the camp .
One detainee , David Hicks , accepted a plea bargain in 2007 , served nine months and is now free in his native Australia .
Mr Hamdan is suicidal and hears voices .
He talks incessantly to himself and says that living alone inside a metal cell and never being allowed to see the sun " boils his mind " .
The isolation in which prisoners are held is blamed for driving them out of their minds with despair .
" He will shout at us ; he will bang his fists on the table , " said his military - appointed defence lawyer , Lieutenant Commander Brian Mizer .
His attempts to stop the case until his client is granted more humane conditions , enabling him to prepare his defence , were rejected last week .
The authorities complain that Mr Hamdan was far from a model inmate and that he routinely spat at guards and threw urine .
Guantanamo inmates face more time in isolation than many on Death Row in the US , say experts on American prison conditions .
But the camp 's spokeswoman , Commander Pauline Storum , claims that detainees are more psychologically robust than the ordinary US prison population , with fewer than 10 per cent mentally ill , compared with 50 per cent of the inmates in US jails .
Nor is there is solitary confinement in Guantanamo , she adds , only " single - occupancy cells " , and in any event prisoners communicate with each other by banging on their walls .
Lawyers handling some 80 war crimes cases are closely watching Mr Hamdan 's trial .
" The issue of mistreatment of prisoners , the miserable lives they live in these cells , will come up in every case , " says Clive Stafford Smith , the British lawyer who is representing 35 detainees .
In April , when Mr Hamdan appeared before the navy captain acting as his military judge , he announced that he would boycott his trial , crying out : " There is no such thing as justice here ! "
The judge told him to have faith in US law , declaring : " You have already been to the Supreme Court [ in Washington ] . "
But the prisoner corrected him .
While his lawyers had won a famous victory over the Bush administration in a case known as Hamdan vs Rumsfeld , he had not left Guantanamo .
Instead , in more than six years of incarceration , he has made exactly two phone calls to his family back in Yemen , and received no visits .
He has been punished for having a Snickers bar in his cell that his lawyers gave him and for stockpiling too many pairs of socks .
" Conditions are asphalt , excrement and worse , " he wrote to his lawyers .
" Why , why , why ? "
The echoes of Hamdan vs Rumsfeld are still rumbling through the legal system .
While Mr Cheney 's adviser called efforts to apply the protections of the Geneva Conventions to prisoners " an abomination " , the Supreme Court ruled emphatically that the administration had to abide by these laws in its war on terror .
Even in wartime , the court said , the President was bound by laws and treaties , including the Geneva Conventions .
The administration had no right to impose military commissions unilaterally , with rules made up in the White House .
So under pressure from President Bush , the 2006 Military Commissions Act was passed by Congress .
This is what will finally be tested tomorrow .
The Supreme Court has given Mr Hamdan the opportunity to challenge his status as an " enemy combatant " by presenting " reasonably available " evidence and witnesses to a panel of three commissioned officers , while being represented by a military officer .
The war between the United States and Iran is on .
American taxpayer dollars are being used , with the permission of Congress , to fund activities that result in Iranians being killed and wounded , and Iranian property destroyed .
This wanton violation of a nation ’s sovereignty would not be tolerated if the tables were turned and Americans were being subjected to Iranian - funded covert actions that took the lives of Americans , on American soil , and destroyed American property and livelihood .
Many Americans remain unaware of what is transpiring abroad in their name .
Many of those who are cognizant of these activities are supportive of them , an outgrowth of misguided sentiment which holds Iran accountable for a list of grievances used by the U.S. government to justify the ongoing global war on terror .
Iran , we are told , is not just a nation pursuing nuclear weapons , but is the largest state sponsor of terror in the world today .
Much of the information behind this is being promulgated by Israel , which has a vested interest in seeing Iran neutralized as a potential threat .
But Israel is joined by another source , even more puzzling in terms of its broad - based acceptance in the world of American journalism : the Mujahadeen-e Khalk , or MEK , an Iranian opposition group sworn to overthrow the theocracy in Tehran .
The CIA today provides material support to the actions of the MEK inside Iran .
The recent spate of explosions in Iran , including a particularly devastating “ accident ” involving a military convoy transporting ammunition in downtown Tehran , appears to be linked to an MEK operation ; its agents working inside munitions manufacturing plants deliberately are committing acts of sabotage which lead to such explosions .
If CIA money and planning support are behind these actions , the agency ’s backing constitutes nothing less than an act of war on the part of the United States against Iran .
The MEK traces its roots back to the CIA - orchestrated overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadeg .
Formed among students and intellectuals , the MEK emerged in the 1960s as a serious threat to the reign of Reza Shah Pahlevi .
Facing brutal repression from the Shah ’s secret police , the SAVAK , the MEK became expert at blending into Iranian society , forming a cellular organizational structure which made it virtually impossible to eradicate .
The MEK membership also became adept at gaining access to positions of sensitivity and authority .
When the Shah was overthrown in 1978 , the MEK played a major role and for a while worked hand in glove with the Islamic Revolution in crafting a post - Shah Iran .
In 1979 the MEK had a central role in orchestrating the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran , and holding 55 Americans hostage for 444 days .
However , relations between the MEK and the Islamic regime in Tehran soured , and after the MEK staged a bloody coup attempt in 1981 , all ties were severed and the two sides engaged in a violent civil war .
Revolutionary Guard members who were active at that time have acknowledged how difficult it was to fight the MEK .
In the end , massive acts of arbitrary arrest , torture and executions were required to break the back of mainstream MEK activity in Iran , although even the Revolutionary Guard today admits the MEK remains active and is virtually impossible to completely eradicate .
It is this stubborn ability to survive and operate inside Iran , at a time when no other intelligence service can establish and maintain a meaningful agent network there , which makes the MEK such an asset to nations such as the United States and Israel .
The MEK is able to provide some useful intelligence ; however , its overall value as an intelligence resource is negatively impacted by the fact that it is the sole source of human intelligence in Iran .
As such , the group has taken to exaggerating and fabricating reports to serve its own political agenda .
In this way , there is little to differentiate the MEK from another Middle Eastern expatriate opposition group , the Iraqi National Congress , or INC , which infamously supplied inaccurate intelligence to the United States and other governments and helped influence the U.S. decision to invade Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein .
Today , the MEK sees itself in a similar role , providing sole - sourced intelligence to the United States and Israel in an effort to facilitate American military operations against Iran and , eventually , to overthrow the Islamic regime in Tehran .
The current situation concerning the MEK would be laughable if it were not for the violent reality of that organization ’s activities .
Upon its arrival in Iraq in 1986 , the group was placed under the control of Saddam Hussein ’s Mukhabarat , or intelligence service .
The MEK was a heavily militarized organization and in 1988 participated in division - size military operations against Iran .
The organization represents no state and can be found on the U.S. State Department ’s list of terrorist organizations , yet since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , the MEK has been under the protection of the U.S. military .
Its fighters are even given “ protected status ” under the Geneva Conventions .
The MEK says its members in Iraq are refugees , not terrorists .
And yet one would be hard - pressed to find why the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees should confer refugee status on an active paramilitary organization that uses “ refugee camps ” inside Iraq as its bases .
The MEK is behind much of the intelligence being used by the International Atomic Energy Agency in building its case that Iran may be pursuing ( or did in fact pursue in the past ) a nuclear weapons program .
The complexity of the MEK - CIA relationship was recently underscored by the agency ’s acquisition of a laptop computer allegedly containing numerous secret documents pertaining to an Iranian nuclear weapons program .
Much has been made about this computer and its contents .
The United States has led the charge against Iran within international diplomatic circles , citing the laptop information as the primary source proving Iran ’s ongoing involvement in clandestine nuclear weapons activity .
Of course , the information on the computer , being derived from questionable sources ( i.e. , the MEK and the CIA , both sworn enemies of Iran ) is controversial and its veracity is questioned by many , including me .
Now , I have a simple solution to the issue of the laptop computer :
Give it the UNSCOM treatment .
Assemble a team of CIA , FBI and Defense Department forensic computer analysts and probe the computer , byte by byte .
Construct a chronological record of how and when the data on the computer were assembled .
Check the “ logic ” of the data , making sure everything fits together in a manner consistent with the computer ’s stated function and use .
Tell us when the computer was turned on and logged into and how it was used .
Then , with this complex usage template constructed , overlay the various themes which have been derived from the computer ’s contents , pertaining to projects , studies and other activities of interest .
One should be able to rapidly ascertain whether or not the computer is truly a key piece of intelligence pertaining to Iran ’s nuclear programs .
The fact that this computer is acknowledged as coming from the MEK and the fact that a proper forensic investigation would probably demonstrate the fabricated nature of the data contained are why the U.S. government will never agree to such an investigation being done .
A prosecutor , when making a case of criminal action , must lay out evidence in a simple , direct manner , allowing not only the judge and jury to see it but also the accused .
If the evidence is as strong as the prosecutor maintains , it is usually bad news for the defendant .
However , if the defendant is able to demonstrate inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the data being presented , then the prosecution is the one in trouble .
And if the defense is able to demonstrate that the entire case is built upon fabricated evidence , the case is generally thrown out .
This , in short , is what should be done with the IAEA ’s ongoing probe into allegations that Iran has pursued nuclear weapons .
The evidence used by the IAEA is unable to withstand even the most rudimentary cross-examination .
It is speculative at best , and most probably fabricated .
Iran has done the right thing in refusing to legitimize this illegitimate source of information .
A key question that must be asked is why , then , does the IAEA continue to permit Olli Heinonen , the agency ’s Finnish deputy director for safeguards and the IAEA official responsible for the ongoing technical inspections in Iran , to wage his one - man campaign on behalf of the United States , Britain and ( indirectly )
Israel regarding allegations derived from sources of such questionable veracity ( the MEK - supplied laptop computer ) ?
Moreover , why is such an official given free rein to discuss such sensitive data with the press , or with politically motivated outside agencies , in a manner that results in questionable allegations appearing in the public arena as unquestioned fact ?
Under normal circumstances , leaks of the sort that have occurred regarding the ongoing investigation into Iran ’s alleged past studies on nuclear weapons would be subjected to a thorough investigation to determine the source and to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to end them .
And yet , in Vienna , Heinonen ’s repeated transgressions are treated as a giant “ non-event , ” the 800 - pound gorilla in the room that everyone pretends is n’t really there .
Heinonen has become the pro-war yin to the anti-confrontation yang of his boss , IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei .
Every time ElBaradei releases the results of the IAEA probe of Iran , pointing out that the IAEA can find no evidence of any past or present nuclear weapons program , and that there is a full understanding of Iran ’s controversial centrifuge - based enrichment program , Heinonen throws a monkey wrench into the works .
Well - publicized briefings are given to IAEA - based diplomats .
Mysteriously , leaks from undisclosed sources occur .
Heinonen ’s Finnish nationality serves as a flimsy cover for neutrality that long ago disappeared .
He is no longer serving in the role as unbiased inspector , but rather a front for the active pursuit of an American - and Israeli - inspired disinformation campaign designed to keep alive the flimsy allegations of a nonexistent Iranian nuclear weapons program in order to justify the continued warlike stance taken by the U.S. and Israel against Iran .
The fact that the IAEA is being used as a front to pursue this blatantly anti-Iranian propaganda is a disservice to an organization with a mission of vital world importance .
The interjection of not only the unverified ( and unverifiable ) MEK laptop computer data , side by side with a newly placed emphasis on a document relating to the forming of uranium metal into hemispheres of the kind useful in a nuclear weapon , is an amateurish manipulation of data to achieve a preordained outcome .
Calling the Iranian possession of the aforementioned document “ alarming , ” Heinonen ( and the media ) skipped past the history of the document , which , of course , has been well explained by Iran previously as something the Pakistani nuclear proliferator A.Q.
Khan inserted on his own volition to a delivery of documentation pertaining to centrifuges .
Far from being a “ top- secret ” document protected by Iran ’s security services , it was discarded in a file of old material that Iran provided to the IAEA inspectors .
When the IAEA found the document , Iran allowed it to be fully examined by the inspectors , and answered every question posed by the IAEA about how the document came to be in Iran .
For Heinonen to call the document “ alarming , ” at this late stage in the game , is not only irresponsible but factually inaccurate , given the definition of the word .
The Iranian document in question is neither a cause for alarm , seeing as it is not a source for any “ sudden fear brought on by the sense of danger , ” nor does it provide any “ warning of existing or approaching danger , ” unless one is speaking of the danger of military action on the part of the United States derived from Heinonen ’s unfortunate actions and choice of words .
Olli Heinonen might as well become a salaried member of the Bush administration , since he is operating in lock step with the U.S. government ’s objective of painting Iran as a threat worthy of military action .
Shortly after Heinonen ’s alarmist briefing in March 2008 , the U.S. ambassador to the IAEA , Gregory Schulte , emerged to announce , “ As today ’s briefing showed us , there are strong reasons to suspect that Iran was working covertly and deceitfully , at least until recently , to build a bomb . ”
Heinonen ’s briefing provided nothing of the sort , being derived from an irrelevant document and a laptop computer of questionable provenance .
But that did not matter to Schulte , who noted that “ Iran has refused to explain or even acknowledge past work on weaponization . ”
Schulte did not bother to note that it would be difficult for Iran to explain or acknowledge that which it has not done .
“ This is particularly troubling , ” Schulte went on , “ when combined with Iran ’s determined effort to master the technology to enrich uranium . ”
Why is this so troubling ?
Because , as Schulte noted , “ Uranium enrichment is not necessary for Iran ’s civil program but it is necessary to produce the fissile material that could be weaponized into a bomb . ”
This , of course , is the crux of the issue : Iran ’s ongoing enrichment program .
Not because it is illegal ; Iran is permitted to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes under Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Not again because Iran ’s centrifuge program is operating in an undeclared , unmonitored fashion ; the IAEA had stated it has a full understanding of the scope and work of the Iranian centrifuge enrichment program and that all associated nuclear material is accounted for and safeguarded .
The problem has never been , and will never be , Iran ’s enrichment program .
The problem is American policy objectives of regime change in Iran , pushed by a combination of American desires for global hegemony and an activist Israeli agenda which seeks regional security , in perpetuity , through military and economic supremacy .
The specter of nuclear enrichment is simply a vehicle for facilitating the larger policy objectives .
Olli Heinonen , and those who support and sustain his work , must be aware of the larger geopolitical context of his actions , which makes them all the more puzzling and contemptible .
A major culprit in this entire sordid affair is the mainstream media .
Displaying an almost uncanny inability to connect the dots , the editors who run America ’s largest newspapers , and the producers who put together America ’s biggest television news programs , have collectively facilitated the most simplistic , inane and factually unfounded story lines coming out of the Bush White House .
The most recent fairy tale was one of “ diplomacy , ” on the part of one William Burns , the No. 3 diplomat in the State Department .
I have studied the minutes of meetings involving John McCloy , an American official who served numerous administrations , Democratic and Republican alike , in the decades following the end of the Second World War .
His diplomacy with the Soviets , conducted with senior Soviet negotiator Valerein Zorin and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev himself , was real , genuine , direct and designed to resolve differences .
The transcripts of the diplomacy conducted between Henry Kissinger and Le Duc
Tho to bring an end to the Vietnam conflict is likewise a study in the give and take required to achieve the status of real diplomacy .
Sending a relatively obscure official like Burns to “ observe ” a meeting between the European Union and Iran , with instructions not to interact , not to initiate , not to discuss , cannot under any circumstances be construed as diplomacy .
Any student of diplomatic history could tell you this .
And yet the esteemed editors and news producers used the term diplomacy , without challenge or clarification , to describe Burns ’ mission to Geneva on July 19 .
The decision to send him there was hailed as a “ significant concession ” on the part of the Bush administration , a step away from war and an indication of a new desire within the White House to resolve the Iranian impasse through diplomacy .
How this was going to happen with a diplomat hobbled and muzzled to the degree Burns was apparently skipped the attention of these writers and their bosses .
Diplomacy , America was told , was the new policy option of choice for the Bush administration .
Of course , the Geneva talks produced nothing .
The United States had made sure Europe , through its foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , had no maneuvering room when it came to the core issue of uranium enrichment :
Iran must suspend all enrichment before any movement could be made on any other issue .
Furthermore , the American - backed program of investigation concerning the MEK - supplied laptop computer further poisoned the diplomatic waters .
Iran , predictably , refused to suspend its enrichment program , and rejected the Heinonen - led investigation into nuclear weaponization , refusing to cooperate further with the IAEA on that matter , noting that it fell outside the scope of the IAEA ’s mandate in Iran .
Condoleezza Rice was quick to respond .
After a debriefing from Burns , who flew to Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates , where Rice was holding closed - door meetings with the foreign ministers of six Arab nations on the issue of Iran , Rice told the media that Iran “ was not serious ” about resolving the standoff .
Having played the diplomacy card , Rice moved on with the real agenda : If Iran did not fully cooperate with the international community ( i.e. , suspend its enrichment program ) , then it would face a new round of economic sanctions and undisclosed punitive measures , both unilaterally on the part of the United States and Europe , as well as in the form of even broader sanctions from the United Nations Security Council ( although it is doubtful that Russia and China would go along with such a plan ) .
The issue of unilateral U.S. sanctions is most worrisome .
Both the House of Representatives , through HR 362 , and the Senate , through SR 580 , are preparing legislation that would call for an air , ground and sea blockade of Iran .
Back in October 1962 , President John F. Kennedy , when considering the imposition of a naval blockade against Cuba in response to the presence of Soviet missiles in that nation , opined that “ a blockade is a major military operation , too .
It ’s an act of war . ”
Which , of course , it is .
The false diplomacy waged by the White House in Geneva simply pre-empted any congressional call for a diplomatic outreach .
Now the president can move on with the mission of facilitating a larger war with Iran by legitimizing yet another act of aggression .
One day , in the not - so - distant future , Americans will awake to the reality that American military forces are engaged in a shooting war with Iran .
Many will scratch their heads and wonder , “ How did that happen ? ”
The answer is simple :
We all let it happen .
We are at war with Iran right now .
We just do n’t have the moral courage to admit it .
Scott Ritter is a former U.N. weapons inspector and Marine intelligence officer who has written extensively about Iran .
In 1901 it was obvious that the workers of the Chorro Falls and Gaitanejo Falls needed a walkway to cross between the falls , to provide transport of materials , vigilance and maintenance of the channel .
Construction of the walkway took four years ; it was finished in 1905 .
In 1921 the king Alfonso XIII crossed the walkway for the inauguration of the dam Conde del Guadalhorce and it became known by its present name .
The walkway has now gone many years without maintenance , and is in a highly deteriorated and dangerous state .
It is one meter ( 3 feet ) in width , and is over 200 meters ( 700 feet ) above the river .
Nearly all of the path has no handrail .
Some parts of the concrete walkway have completely collapsed and all that is remaining is the steel beam originally in place to hold it up and the wire that follows most the path .
One can latch onto the wire to keep from falling .
Many people have lost their lives on the walkway in recent years .
After four people died in two accidents in 1999 and 2000 , the local government closed the entrances ; however , adventurous tourists still find their way into the walkway .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- A Pakistani man accused of killing his daughter because she wanted out of an arranged marriage told a judge Tuesday that he had done nothing wrong .
Chaudhry Rashid , 54 , later said he was " very disturbed " and " not in a state of mind " to talk because of the death of his daughter , Sandeela Kanwal .
A somber and tearful Rashid made his first court appearance Tuesday .
He was advised through an Urdu interpreter of the murder charge and his legal rights .
A judge also admonished Rashid , of Jonesboro , Georgia , to not make any statements without clearing them with his attorney .
" My client is going through a difficult time .
As you can imagine , he is distraught , " attorney Tammi Long said after the hearing .
When asked about Rashid 's comments in court , Long said her next move was to speak with him in depth .
" We will work diligently to provide the best defense for our client against these charges , " she said .
She requested that Rashid 's family be given privacy , but said Rashid is holding up as well as can be expected .
Court records indicate that a preliminary hearing in the case has been scheduled for July 24 .
Officers found Kanwal dead in an upstairs bedroom of the family 's suburban Atlanta home early Sunday , according to a Clayton County police report .
Police discovered possible ligature marks on her body and made note of an iron and a necklace as potential causes of the bruising .
Authorities arrived at the home around 2 a.m. , shortly after Rashid 's wife called police .
She reported that she had been awakened by screaming but could n't understand the language , the report said .
She said she was afraid and left the house to call police .
Rashid 's wife told authorities that Kanwal recently had wed in Pakistan in an arranged marriage .
The young woman 's husband was living in Chicago , Illinois , police said , but Kanwal remained at her father 's home and worked at a metro Atlanta Wal - Mart for a brief time .
" The victim was not interested in marrying , nor remaining married to her husband , " the police report said , citing information authorities received from Rashid 's wife .
" This was causing a great deal of friction between the victim and her father , " so much so that the two had not spoken in two months , the report said .
Watch how an arranged marriage ended in violence »
Police found a " distraught and possibly mournful " Rashid sitting behind a vehicle in the driveway .
" My daughter is dead , " he told police .
When asked how she died , police said Rashid did not answer .
" He just dropped his head , " the report states .
" Apparently she and the father had argued over the marriage and the fact that it was arranged , and at some point during the altercation he did end up killing his daughter , " said Clayton County Police spokesman Tim Owens .
Neighbor Veronda Luckett said the family had always been " relatively quiet . "
" They seemed to be decent , lovely people , " she said .
" Honor killings " -- the slaying by family members of a woman or girl thought to be bringing them shame -- are usually kept quiet , making it difficult to determine how frequently they occur .
The United Nations Population Fund estimated in September 2000 that as many as 5,000 women and girls fall victim to such killings each year .
Ajay Nair , associate dean of multicultural affairs at Columbia University , said many immigrant families struggle over cultural and generational gaps , but that most South Asian communities in the United States enjoy " wonderful " relationships within their families .
" My immediate reaction was that this is an anomaly in the South Asian American community , " Nair said Tuesday .
" This is n't a rampant problem within South Asian communities .
What is a problem , I think , is domestic violence , and that cuts across all communities . "
Nair said he believes a " significant human rights campaign " is needed to address such killings .
" It 's not just a U.S. issue .
I think it happens across the world , and I think people need to recognize domestic violence and any kind of violence related to women as a serious , serious issue , " Nair said .

Well , that ’s why many Flash apps have the infamous “ Skip Intro ” button included , and now * , Google does too .
In a search for e.g. yuasa france , the top result – yuasa . fr – is listed as normal .
But to the right side of the title , there ’s a link reading “ Skip Intro ” , which will take you straight to yuasa.fr/index.htm .
( On the other hand , perhaps for some sites it would also make sense to directly link to the skipped page ... and show a link to “ See Intro ” to the right . )

By now you 've probably heard about the brainless July 29 police assault on Cheye Calvo of Berwyn Heights , Md. , and his family .
First the cops plant marijuana on them , then storm the house , terrorize Calvo , his mother - in - law , and his wife , and shoot dead their two Labrador retrievers .
Despite having apparently been investigating a pot- smuggling ring for some time , the cops did n't even know that Calvo is the community 's mayor .
Doug Donovan at The Baltimore Sun wrote :
After the raid , Prince George 's County police officials who burst into the home of Berwyn Heights ' mayor last week seized the same unopened package of marijuana that an undercover officer had delivered an hour earlier .
What police left behind was a house stained with blood and a trail of questions about their conduct .
No other evidence of illegal activity was found , and no one was arrested at Mayor Cheye Calvo 's home in this small bedroom community near College Park .
This week Prince George 's police arrested two men for orchestrating a plot to deliver marijuana to the addresses of unsuspecting recipients - among them , Calvo 's wife , Trinity Tomsic .
Yet neither county Police Chief Melvin C. High nor Sheriff Michael A. Jackson have apologized to him , his wife or her mother , Georgia Porter , for the raid that traumatized the family and killed their black Labrador retrievers , Payton and Chase .
Yesterday , Calvo called on the U.S. Justice Department 's civil rights decision to investigate the raid and other similar actions by Prince George 's law enforcement .
He said officers burst into his house without knocking or announcing themselves , in violation of the warrant they had .
And for what ?
Weed .
Even the most avid drug foe cannot say with a straight face that marijuana comes within a country mile of equaling the negative impact on society of alcohol .
But , of course , one is legal and the other is prohibited and the law must at all costs be enforced .
It would be encouraging at this juncture if the word " unbelievable " could be used to describe what happened to Mayor Calvo and his family .
But it is completely believable to anyone who has even cursorily followed the grotesqueries of what Richard Nixon first called the War on Drugs 37 years ago .
These sorts of " mistaken " raids happen frequently , but do n't get the publicity that an infuriated white mayor in an upscale community can elicit .
Calvo and his family were lucky one of them was n't shot like a dog .
It would n't have been the first time .
In this case , apparently , not only did the police step over the bounds of commonsense and decency - Calvo claims they shot one Labrador as it was running away - they may well have acted illegally and lied about it .
According to Rosalind S. Helderman at the Washington Post :
Prince George 's County authorities did not have a " no - knock " warrant when they burst into the home of a mayor July 29 , shooting and killing his two dogs -- contrary to what police said after the incident .
...
But a review of the warrant indicates that police neither sought nor received permission from Circuit Court Judge Albert W. Northrup to enter without knocking .
Northrup found probable cause to suspect that drugs might be in the house and granted police a standard search warrant .
" There 's nothing in the four corners of the warrant saying anything about the Calvos being a threat to law enforcement , " said Calvo 's attorney , Timothy Maloney .
" This was a lawless act by law enforcement . "
Unlike other illegal raids against innocent people , this is probably going to be an expensive one for the police .
Meaning an outlay of county cash in a settlement decree plus the bad publicity .
Which is as it should be .
But ultimately it will surely turn out as just another quickly forgotten bump in the road for America 's $ 50 billion - a- year drug interdiction effort .
After nearly four decades of official war and a more informal effort for decades before that , what has all this accomplished ?
Drugs are used by people across ethnic , gender , class and educational lines .
Today they are cheaper and often of higher quality than in the past .
They are more accessible to young people .
Programs like Drug Abuse Resistance Education are failures .
The percentage of people incarcerated for non-violent drug - related crimes is shocking , and even though drugs are used by all segments of society , most of those imprisoned for drug crimes are likely to be poor and non-white .
When they emerge from the slam again , they are tainted as drug felons , barred from getting education loans , and face , as do all felons , a tough time finding employment , with all the costs to society of that multifaceted problem .
Crime itself , including much violent crime and a huge proportion of thefts , is exacerbated by drug laws , as is corruption among public officials , including , all - too - often police .
Meanwhile , those who need treatment beds for drug addiction have a hard time finding them because of lack of funding that might be available if so many people were n't being stuck in prison beds .
A few years ago , some brave mayors of long incumbency and a few retired police chiefs - notably Norm Stamper of Seattle and Joe McNamara of San Jose - said it was time to stop the insanity and remake American drug laws .
Not across - the - board wholesale legalization , but sensible reform , including recognition of the fact that tens of millions use marijuana .
However , despite the profound wreckage caused by this long - running war , there is n't a handful of nationally prominent politicians who will dare stand up to say or do anything about it .
A drug that was once used as an antihistamine by people with allergies in Russia offers new hope for Alzheimer 's patients , a study published today suggests .
The drug , dimebon , has so far been trialled on only 183 patients , but it led to significant improvement in the understanding and behaviour of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer 's disease , according to the research published in the Lancet medical journal .
Treatments for Alzheimer 's are badly needed .
Those that exist are controversial ; arguments rage over whether or not Aricept and similar drugs work well enough to be worth their high cost .
The dimebon trial took place in Russia , where the drug has dropped out of use in allergy treatment as newer drugs have been discovered .
The 183 patients from 11 different sites were randomly divided into two groups and given either dimebon three times a day or a placebo .
The team , led by Dr Rachelle Doody from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , found those on the drug were better aware and able to carry out tasks .
The improvements were maintained and even improved over 12 months , which no Alzheimer 's drugs have succeeded in doing so far .
A bigger trial , which will establish whether the drug really is a useful treatment for most people with Alzheimer 's , has been announced .
When a visibly aged Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and four alleged accomplices were reunited in a sterile military courtroom here Thursday , they laughed and chatted like old school chums and apparently rekindled their common cause : to defy their American enemies or die trying .
Strident and unremorseful over the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks they allegedly plotted , four of the men declared their eagerness to be executed .
Asked by the tribunal ’s chief judge , Marine Col. Ralph H. Kohlmann , if he recognized that he could be put to death if convicted , Mohammed said : “ This is what I wish .
I ’m looking to be a martyr for a long time . ”
Sporting a bushy gray beard and elastic - banded spectacles and looking a generation older than his 43 years , the man known to his interrogators and captors as KSM occasionally stood to make random observations to the crowded courtroom or to adjust his white tunic and head covering .
At times he looked indifferent to the life - or - death issues around him .
Advertisement
Alleged Al Qaeda training camp steward Walid bin Attash , a boyish - looking 30 - year - old , had a question for Kohlmann .
“ Will we be buried at Guantanamo or will our bodies be returned to our countries ? ” he asked dispassionately .
Ramzi Binalshibh , believed to have coordinated a Hamburg , Germany , sleeper cell while three of the four Sept. 11 pilots waited for their orders to hijack U.S. airliners , reminded the court that he had tried to be part of the suicide mission but was denied a U.S. visa .
“ I have been seeking martyrdom for five years ! ” Binalshibh said when warned that he could face death if convicted .
“ If this martyrdom happens today , I will welcome it .
God is great !
God is great !
God is great ! ”
Binalshibh was the only defendant wearing shackles on his bulging ankles , a restraint Guantanamo authorities declined to explain .
With the courtroom ringed by camouflage - clad guards and the entire structure surrounded by concentric rings of razor - wire - topped fences , the likelihood of escape appeared remote .
Advertisement
Ali Abdul Aziz Ali told Kohlmann he shared the views of the three before him who praised martyrdom and replied nonchalantly to Kohlmann ’s question as to whether he knew the ultimate penalty could be levied against him : “ Naturally .
I know . ”
Ali , who insisted to the court that his real name was Ammar al Baluchi , spoke in fluent English , mocking the judge ’s earnest assurances of his rights to legal assistance .
A nephew of Mohammed and a college - trained computer engineer , Ali said it was late for his U.S. jailers to be offering him a lawyer .
“ Everything that has happened here is unfair and unjust .
Since the first time I was arrested , I might have appreciated that , ” he said of the offer of free legal representation .

“ The government is talking about lawyers free of charge .
The government also tortured me free of charge all these years , ” he said .
Kohlmann told him he considered it unwise for the defendants to insist on representing themselves , to which Ali retorted , “ For me , this proceeding in its entirety is unwise . ”
Though the defendants were defiant of the military authority around them , none mentioned Al Qaeda or its leader , Osama bin Laden .
Neither did they express remorse for the nearly 3,000 victims of the Sept. 11 attacks .

Past confessions
Mohammed ’s defiance had been expected , as he confessed to masterminding the attacks during a March 2007 hearing here after being transferred six months earlier from secret CIA custody abroad .
He also claims to have wielded the saber that beheaded kidnapped Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan shortly after the 2001 attacks .
Kohlmann said he would issue a schedule for motions and a trial date after further reflection , although he seemed inclined to get the case moving as soon as possible .
Prosecutors have suggested mid-September for the start of trial .
The judge also deferred ruling on whether Binalshibh and Saudi suspect Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi should be allowed to reject their military lawyers and represent themselves .
Advertisement
In Thursday ’s proceeding , which stretched over 10 hours to include breaks for lunch and prayers , it was apparent that Mohammed was directing the effort by the defendants to present a united front in refusing to work with military defense lawyers .
He and Binalshibh interjected comments and observations when other defendants were being questioned .
The Army lawyer for Hawsawi said his client had come into the courtroom willing to work with his defense team until Mohammed taunted him .
“ What , are you in the American army now ? ” the lawyer , Maj .
Jon Jackson , quoted Mohammed as saying .
When asked by the judge if he accepted Jackson and the rest of the team to represent him , Hawsawi echoed his codefendants : “ I want to defend myself , by myself . ”

Their animated exchanges with Kohlmann in the high - security courtroom at this U.S. naval base in southern Cuba exposed what appeared to be an eagerness to collaborate with one another and coordinate their actions .
They laughed and chatted for half an hour from their seats at the ends of five long defense tables before Kohlmann gaveled the arraignment into session .
Dressed in the white tunics , skullcaps and head wraps of their Islamic cultures , they conferred , stage - whispering in Arabic from one table to the next , well into Kohlmann ’s dry recitation of the tribunal ’s rules and procedures .
The judge sought to hold the arraignment to a strict timetable , rejecting numerous defense appeals for delay to allow the lawyers more time to convince their clients to accept representation .

Quoting the Koran
Nevertheless , the defendants often appeared to be in command of the proceedings , professing their contempt for their captors and at times provoking laughs from the gallery of media and human rights observers behind a soundproofed glass wall at the back of the courtroom .
In a melodious voice , Mohammed chanted verses from the Koran expressing faith in Allah to protect him , then provided their English translations , observing that his linguistic skills seemed better than those of the tribunal ’s official Arabic interpreter .
Mohammed denounced U.S. law as immoral , citing some states ’ recognition of gay marriage .
“ Evil laws are not the laws of God , laws allowing same - sexual marriage , ” he told the court .
“ I consider all American laws under the Constitution to be evil . ”
Advertisement
He also chastised Kohlmann for telling civilian defense lawyers with expertise in capital cases to sit down and be quiet when they objected to his refusal to postpone proceedings .
And he deemed the tribunal “ an inquisition , not a trial . ”
“ After five years of torturing . . . you transfer us to Inquisition Land in Guantanamo , ” he said .
At times he was exceedingly deferential , leaving court spectators uncertain if he was mocking Kohlmann .
“ Go right ahead , ” he offered when the judge interrupted one of his lengthier assurances that God was on his side .
Advertisement
During a midday break in the arraignment , Mohammed was shown a courtroom sketch artist ’s rendition of him , which he rejected , saying he did n’t like how his nose was drawn .
Under the Geneva Conventions protection against “ parading ” prisoners of war , captives have the right to approve or reject images of themselves before they can be made public .
He told the pool artist , Janet Hamlin , that he would approve the sketch if she looked at his FBI picture -- the infamous image of a disheveled , dark - haired Mohammed in a white undershirt -- and modify the feature to match that .
“ It was a little beaky , ” Hamlin conceded of the original sketch .

In the late 1960 ’s and early 1970 ’s , the British and the US displaced a whole island population just so that the US could build an American military base .
These indigenous people , Chagossians , lived on the island of Diego Garcia .
There were about 2000 residents and they were British citizens .
They were tricked into giving up their island and the British lied to the UN claiming that the residents of Diego Garcia were “ temporary workers ” .
They started out by gathering all the pet dogs and cats and then gassing these pets .
Next , the residents were placed on a ship and sent to live on the island of Mauritius which is part of the Mascarene Islands .
There they live in abject poverty , hidden from the tourists that visit these islands .
After thirty years of protesting and working within the law , the Chagossians were finally granted the right to return by the High Court of Justice in London .
The British managed to block their return .
From Wikipedia ( excerpt ) …
Despite the court judgement recognising the Chagossians ’ rights , the islands were uninhabited and there were no civilian transportation links .
Most of the Chagossians remained in impoverished conditions , unable to facilitate their own return .
Promises of the British Government to assist in resettlement failed to materialise .
On October 9 , 2003 , in a controversial judgement , Justice Ousley of the High Court decreed that the Chagossians had no right to any compensation from the British Government .
Then , in June 2004 , the British Government effectively overruled the 2000 court decision in favour of the Chagossians by an order - in - council .
The Chagossians and their advocates appealed this move to the High Court of England and Wales and the European Court of Human Rights .

Update since the making of the documentary :
( Excerpt from Wikipedia )
In early April 2006 , a group of around 100 Chagossians were permitted to visit the British Indian Ocean Territory for the first time in over 30 years in a trip .
The trip was organised and financed by the British Foreign Office and the government of Mauritius . [ 1 ]
On May 11 , 2006 , the Chagossians won their case before the High Court , which ruled that they are entitled to return to the Chagos Archipelago .
It remains to be seen whether when or how the judgement might be implemented in practice .
[ 2 ]
The UK government launched an appeal at the Court of Appeal against the May 11 ruling in June 2006 .
The Foreign office has put forward an argument based on the treatment of the Japanese Canadians following the attacks on Pearl Harbour . [ 3 ]
On May 23 , 2007 , the Court of Appeal dismissed the UK Government ’s appeal saying that the methods used to stop the Chagos families to return to the islands were “ unlawful ” and “ an abuse of power ” .
[ 4 ]
The Government was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords , but have stated an intention to appeal to the Lords against that refusal .
The Government launched an appeal to the Law Lords in November 2007 .
The American lease on Diego Garcia is due to expire in 2016 .
From Cooperative Research
May 23 , 2007
The British Royal Court of Appeal rules that the Chagossians were tricked , starved , and even terrorized from their homes by the British government 30 years ago ( see July 27 , 1971 - May 26 , 1973 ) , and can return to their homes immediately .
The islanders had previously won a ruling in 2006 , however foreign secretary Margaret Beckett had appealed that ruling ( see May 11 , 2006 ) .
Explaining the court ’s decision , Lord Justice Sedley says that “ while a natural or man-made disaster could warrant the temporary , perhaps even indefinite , removal of a population for its own safety and so rank as an act of governance , the permanent exclusion of an entire population from its homeland for reasons unconnected with their collective well - being cannot have that character and accordingly cannot be lawfully accomplished by use of the prerogative power of governance . ”
The British Foreign Office says it is “ disappointed ” with the decision and says it may file an appeal with the House of Lords .

This is shameful .
Never one to be shy about tackling the so called " homosexual agenda , " conservative news channel Fox News discussed the controversial song " I kissed a Girl " by Katy Perry .
They title the segment " Unholy Melody " and talk about how Katy Perry formerly a Christian singer , can no longer be considered a Christian .
" It shows girls you got to do something really naughty to get noticed " .
I did n't know that a girl on girl kiss was considered " unholy " anti-christian , and " naughty " .
The anchor goes on to say " What kind of message of confusion does this send to kids ? "
Fox News is right to address that its wrong that our culture has a double standard when it comes to two females kissing versus two males kissing .
They are also correct in pointing out that it is blatantly misogynist for our culture to encourage female kissing simply for the pleasure of male viewers .
That being said the song by Katy Perry is already filled with homophobia in my opinion and Fox News has just added their additional homophobic rant .
Instead of taking Katy Perry to task on being anti-queer they decide that she is pro-queer and a bad influence .
Please click to contact " The Live Desk with Martha & Trace " and tell them to stop their blatant homophobic news coverage .

The police and State Prosecutor 's Office are now handling six investigations against Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
In light of the multiple probes , the investigation team dealing with the various affairs has been expanded .
The reinforced team plans to complete its work soon and will likely file a recommendation for an indictment against Olmert .
Calm Labor official :
We should n’t do a thing about Olmert Attila Somfalvi Party members unmoved by new suspicions against prime minister .
' It 's all part of the same filth , and in any case the race for primaries in Kadima has begun , ' a senior source says Labor official :
We should n’t do a thing about Olmert
travel affair is viewed as a surprising ramification of the Talansky affair .
The same sources estimated that the investigation file would be handed over to the State Prosecutor 's Office by the police within several weeks , with a recommendation to indict the prime minister in both affairs .
The State Prosecutor 's Office will need some time to decide whether to charge the prime minister , but should an indictment be filed , Olmert has already promised to leave office .
Over the past week , police investigators continued collecting evidence and documents related to the new affair .
At this stage , sources involved in the investigation say there will likely be no need to complete the investigation abroad and that the probe focuses on incidents which took place in Israel
According to law enforcement sources , the prime minister is expected to be questioned once more both on he Talansky affair and on the new affair .
One of the suspicions which will be checked is how Olmert funded his children 's trips abroad .
According to the suspicions , these journeys were financed by money accumulated in the prime minister 's account at the Rishon Tours travel agency .
Police officials have rejected claims made by Olmert 's associates , that the trips were financed by the " points " he accumulated , claiming these trips were paid for with money .
( CNN ) --
What was believed to be the sixth human foot to wash up on the shores of British Columbia in recent months proved to be a fake , authorities said Thursday .
RCMP officers use a container to carry a shoe found on a Canadian beach on Wednesday .
A " skeletonized animal paw " had been placed in a sock and athletic shoe that was packed with dried seaweed , the British Columbia Coroners Service announced .
The hoax was uncovered as the coroner 's office began DNA and other forensic tests on the supposed foot in an attempt to identify the person to whom it belonged .
The coroners service , a forensic pathologist and an anthropologist all examined the shoe and remains before declaring it a fake .
" It is the position of BCCS that this type of hoax is reprehensible and very disrespectful to the families of missing persons , " authorities said in a written statement .
" It fuels inappropriate speculation and creates undue anxiety for families and communities while wasting valuable investigative time and resources that could be spent on the main investigations . "
Police initially believed that a right human foot had been found in a man 's size 10 black Adidas athletic shoe .
The grisly discovery was made Wednesday .
Watch woman talk about the mystery »
The find came amid conjecture over the source of five other severed human feet that have been found along the Canadian province 's Pacific coast in the past 11 months .
Authorities are continuing to investigate multiple possibilities on the origin of the feet , from foul play to the possibility that they belonged to victims of a plane crash .
" We are exploring the possibility that it could be people who may have drowned , " said Annie Linteau , a spokeswoman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
" It could be missing fishermen .
It could be the remains of people who may have died in a plane crash . "

Global TV : Theories fly on severed feet mystery Vancouver Sun : Experts mull source of feet on beach
Vancouver Sun : Experts mull source of feet on beach AC360° Blog : Severed feet -- what 's going on ?
When asked about the suspicion of foul play , Linteau noted that the first four feet contained no tool marks and were therefore deemed not to have been severed .
A woman walking on the beach reported the sixth find , said Sgt. Mike Tresoor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the town of Campbell River on Vancouver Island , British Columbia .
Sandra Malone , manager of the Thunderbird RV Park and Campground on the Tyee Spit , said a woman came in about 10:30 a.m. and asked her to call police , saying she had found the shoe with the foot inside it .
While waiting for police , Malone said , she walked to the beach with the woman and saw it for herself .
" The leg bones were coming out of the running shoe about 3 to 4 inches , " she said .
" There were no tissues or anything attached . "
She said seaweed was wrapped around the top of the running shoe , making it hard to tell whether any tissue was inside the shoe .
But she said the foot appeared to have been deliberately severed , as the bones " had been cut clean across . "
Another foot -- a left foot still in a shoe -- was found Monday on the shore of Westham Island , south of Vancouver .
Police said it was taken to a coroner for DNA testing .
The Vancouver Sun newspaper said the first four feet found were all right feet , making the foot found Monday the only left foot .
Experts told The Sun there could be explanations that did not suggest foul play .
Ian Buckingham , a retired coroner , told the newspaper the ankle joint can come apart easily if a body is decomposing at sea .
Curtis Ebbesmeyer , an expert on ocean currents , told The Sun a foot wearing a buoyant athletic shoe could float as far as 1,000 miles .
Although the gruesome finds have drawn international attention , police said it may take some time to unravel the mystery .
" We suffer from the ' CSI ' effect : People think this can happen very quickly , " Brooks said .
" It could take weeks or months .
And even if we get a DNA sample , we need a sample to match it with . "
The mystery has caused a stir and led to many rumors , locals say .
One newspaper has begun investigating a rash of young men who have gone missing in the area .
Some have wondered whether the feet could belong to five men who were in a plane that crashed three years ago in the waterway where the feet were found .
Some of those men's relatives were at the Campbell River site on Wednesday .
" It 's a constant reminder every time , from the time the first foot washed up , " said Kirsten Stevens , whose husband , Dave , died in the crash .
Although her husband 's body was located , Stevens said , the other men's relatives never recovered their loved ones ' remains .
" It reopens the wound every single time , " she said .

I 'm not surprised .
This is Haiti where like other poor countries , children are " sold " or put into servitude as a way of feeding and sheltering those children .
Unfortunately this occurs in a lot of countries including America .
I did n't watch this story this morning , but I 'd watch the one where the conduct the same experiment in America .
Not because I do n't feel for the poor of other countries , but because it is also a problem in this country as is child prostitution .
It 's easy to create a buzz and outrage about a poor country that allows this while ignoring our own problem with the same issues .
School sack races cancelled by health and safety - because the children might fall over
Children have been banned from taking part in sack and three - legged races at their school sports day in case they hurt themselves .
The decision has been slammed as ' completely over the top ' and of no benefit .
Teachers at John F Kennedy Primary in Washington , Tyne and Wear , dropped the popular events after discussions with Beamish Open Air Museum , where an Edwardian - themed sports day is being held today .
Teachers at the John F. Kennedy Primary school have scrapped the sports day sack race fearing children will fall over
Children taking part are to dress in period costume and play old - fashioned games as part of the school 's centenary celebrations .
Events such as running , hopping and throwing ping - pong balls into buckets will take place , but it was decided that the sack and three - legged races were far too risky .
Simon Woolley , head of education at Beamish in County Durham , said : " We looked at a three - legged race and a sack race but what we want to do is minimise the risk to the children .
' We had to assess which of the activities were liable to cause a risk .
We thought we would be better to do hopping and running instead because there was less chance of them falling over . '
The decision has come under fire by the Campaign Against Political Correctness group .
Founder Laura Midgely , of Whitley Bay , North Tyneside , said : ' It 's health and safety rules gone mad .
I think it 's completely over the top .
' Why should these activities be so dangerous when they 're fine in every other school ?
We certainly had no problems with these events when I was at school .
' In any case , the worst thing that could possibly happen is the children fall over .
' They 're going to fall over doing any event are n't they ?
' Three - legged races are very constructive and involve teamwork . . . they are good for a number of reasons .
It 's a great shame . '
Around 375 children aged four to 11 are taking part in the event .
Teacher and organiser Gill Hanley said : " As far as I know , an awful lot of schools have n't done these kind of activities for a long time so I do n't see that it 's a problem .
' We decided we had too many events anyway and we wanted the easiest things that we could get for the children to take part in . '

Interval computations provide an alternative to traditional numeric computations .
The fundamental difference is that interval computations trade result precision for accuracy , while the traditional floating - point computations do accuracy for precision .
That is - the result of a traditional floating - point operation has the precision of arguments .
The rounding errors are accumulated as accuracy loss .
Differently to this the result of an interval operation suffers no accuracy loss , in the sense that the mathematical outcome of the operation is contained by the result interval .
Rounding errors in interval operations are accumulated as the interval width , i.e. as precision loss .
This fundamental property of interval operations yields the extension principle by which numeric operations are extended to the interval ones :
Let f be a numeric operation of N arguments : f(x 1 , x 2 , .. , x N ) .
Then the corresponding interval operation F ( I 1 , I 2 , .. , I N ) is defined as
F ( I 1 , I 2 , .. , I N ) =[l , u ] , where l = Inf ( f(y 1 , y 2 , .. , y N ) ) u = Sup ( f(y 1 , y 2 , .. , y N ) ) y i ∈ I i , i=1..N y i ∈ I i , i=1..N
For example consider the operation +. I 1 =[a , b ] , I 2 =[c , d ] . + is monotonically ascending , thus Inf is a+c and Sup is b+d and so [ a , b ] + [ c , d ] = [ a+ c , b+d ] .
Any combination of interval operations maintain the property , but changing order of operations or splitting operations into smaller ones may change the precision of the result ( the result interval width ) .
E.g. x2 is not necessarily equal to x*x , still both contain the exact outcome .
1. Types and operations
The packages define a logical and interval types .
The interval types are obtained through instantiation of the corresponding generic packages .
Interval and numeric types can be mixed where the result has mathematical sense .
1.1 . Tri-state logic
The package Intervals serves as a root package .
It also provides tri-state logic necessary to define relational operations on intervals .
The type Logical is defined as :
type Logical is ( False , True , Uncertain ) ;
The following operations are defined for Logical :
function " not " ( Left : Logical ) return Logical ;
function " and " ( Left , Right : Logical ) return Logical ;
function " and " ( Left : Logical ; Right : Boolean )
return Logical ;
function " and " ( Left : Boolean ; Right : Logical )
return Logical ;
function " or " ( Left , Right : Logical ) return Logical ;
function " or " ( Left : Logical ; Right : Boolean )
return Logical ;
function " or " ( Left : Boolean ; Right : Logical )
return Logical ;
function " xor " ( Left , Right : Logical ) return Logical ;
function " xor " ( Left : Logical ; Right : Boolean )
return Logical ;
function " xor " ( Left : Boolean ; Right : Logical )
return Logical ;
The following table summarizes the behaviour of three - state logical operations :
x y x and y ( & ) x or y ( ∨ ) x xor y false false false false false false true false true true false uncertain false uncertain uncertain true true true true false true uncertain uncertain true uncertain uncertain uncertain uncertain uncertain uncertain
The following tables describe the operations in the form customary for the papers on logic ( uncertainty is denoted as ┴ ) :
and 0 1 ┴ or 0 1 ┴ xor 0 1 ┴ not 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ┴ 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 ┴ 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 ┴ 1 0 ┴ 0 ┴ ┴ ┴ ┴ 1 ┴ ┴ 0 ┴ ┴ ┴ ┴
function To_Logical ( Left : Boolean ) return Logical ;
This function converts the argument to the corresponding fuzzy logical value .
1.2 . Interval arithmetic
Two generic child packages Integers and Floats provide interval arithmetic for integer and floating - point types :
generic
type Number is range <>;
package Intervals .
Integers is
...
generic
type Number is digits <>;
package Intervals .
Floats is
...
The formal parameter Number is the type used for the bounds .
For Intervals .
Integers it is an integer type .
For Intervals .
Floats it is a floating - point type .
The type Interval is defined by the packages as :
type Interval is record
From : Number ;
To : Number ;
end record ;
The conventional numeric operations are defined on intervals .
Among two operands one is allowed to be of the type Number . :
function " abs " ( Left : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " + " ( Left : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " - " ( Left : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " ** " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Natural ) return Interval ;
function " + " ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " + " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Interval ;
function " + " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " - " ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " - " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Interval ;
function " - " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " * " ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " * " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Interval ;
function " * " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " / " ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Interval ;
function " / " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Interval ;
function " / " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Interval ;
The interval operations over arguments [ a , b ] and [ c , d ] are defined as follows :
[ a , b ] + [ c , d ] = [ a+c , b+d ] [ a , b ] - [ c , d ] = [ a -d , b - c ] [ a , b ] · [ c , d ] = [ min ( a·c , a·d , b·c , b·d ) , max ( a·c , a·d , b·c , b·d ) ] [ a , b ] / [ c , d ] = [ a , b ] · [ 1/d , 1/c ] , if [ c , d ] does not contain 0
Exponentiation by a natural power [ a , b]k :
if 0 ∈[a , b ] , then Observe also that for intervals only [ a , b] 2 ⊆ [ a , b ] · [ a , b ] is true .
For example [ - 1 , 2 ] · [ - 1 , 2 ] = [ - 2 , 4 ] , but [ - 1 , 2] 2= [ 0 , 4 ] .
In general case an independency analysis of the variables involved in an interval expression might be required to improve accuracy of multiplicative operations .
[ a , b ] 0 = [ 0 , 1 ] [ a , b ] 2n = [ 0 , max ( a2n , b2n ) ] [ a , b ] 2n+1 = [ a2n+1 , b2n+1 ] if [ a , b ] > 0 , then [ a , b ] 0 = [ 1 , 1 ] [ a , b ] k>0 = [ ak , bk ] if [ a , b ] < 0 , then [ a , b ] 0 = [ 1 , 1 ] [ a , b ] 2n = [ b2n , a 2n ] [ a , b ] 2n+1 = [ a2n+1 , b2n+1 ]
For all operations over interval bounds no overflow checks are made explicitly .
Constraint_Error is propagated only when a numeric operation on bounds raises it .
That depends on the behavior of the type Number :
If Number is an integer type , overflows cause Constraint_Error , except the cases when this is explicitly suppressed by a compiler pragma or a switch ;
If Number is a floating - point type , then the value of the attribute Number ' Machine_Overflows indicates if Constraint_Error will propagate .
See G.2.1. Ada Reference Manual .
The result of any inexact operation ( an interval ) is defined to contain the exact mathematical result except the cases of overflows .
For integer arithmetic , in which only division is not precise , it means that for instance , [ 1 , 1 ] /2 = [ 0 , 1 ] , while 1/2 is 0 .
Division to intervals containing zero raises Constraint_Error .
Floating - point arithmetic emulates ↑ and ↓ rounding .
A discussion concerning implementation of interval arithmetic can be found in Introduction to interval computation , G. Alefeld , J. Herzberger ; Academic Press , 1983 .
The relational operations defined on intervals are :
function " > " ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Logical ;
function " > " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Logical ;
function " > " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Logical ;
function " >= " ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Logical ;
function " >= " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Logical ;
function " >= " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Logical ;
function " <= " ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Logical ;
function " <= " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Logical ;
function " <= " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Logical ;
function " < " ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Logical ;
function " < " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Logical ;
function " < " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Logical ;
Among two operands one is allowed to be of the type Number .
Equality " = " ( and so inequality " /= " ) is implemented as in the set theory and so the predefined equality is used .
An alternative definition ( [ a , b ] =[c , d ] ⇔ ∀x∈ [ a , b ] ∀y∈[ c , d ] x=y ) would be rather useless .
However other relational operators are implemented in exactly this sense , i.e. if @ is a relational operator defined on numbers , then :
∀x ∈ [ a , b ] ∀y∈[ c , d ] x@y ⇒ [ a , b]@[c , d ] ; ∀x ∈ [ a , b ] ∀y∈[ c , d ] x@y ⇒ [ a , b]@[c , d ]
function " & " ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Boolean ;
function " & " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Boolean ;
function " & " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Boolean ;
The function " & " returns true if the intersection of Left and Right is not empty .
Other operations defined on intervals :
function Distance ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Number ;
function Distance ( Left : Interval ; Right : Number ) return Number ;
function Distance ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Number ;
This function returns the interval distance defined as max ( |a - c| , |b - d| ) .
An upper bound of the precise distance is returned .
function From ( Left : Interval ) return Number ;
function To ( Left : Interval ) return Number ;
These functions return the interval bounds .
function Is_In ( Left , Right : Interval ) return Boolean ;
function Is_In ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval ) return Boolean ;
These functions Is_In implement membership test .
They return true if Left is a subinterval or else an element of Right .
function Is_Negative ( Left : Interval ) return Boolean ;
function Is_Positive ( Left : Interval ) return Boolean ;
These functions test if the argument is negative or positive .
Note that non-positive interval is not necessarily a negative one .
If both functions return false , then the interval contains zero .
function Length ( Left : Interval ) return Number ;
The interval length is defined as b-a .
This function returns an upper bound of the precise result .
function To_Interval ( Left : Number ) return Interval ;
function To_Interval ( Left ; Right : Number ) return Interval ;
These functions are used to convert numbers to intervals .
The second function propagates Constraint_Error when Left is greater than Right .
2. Dimensioned intervals
The generic child package Measures provides an implementation of dimensioned intervals :
generic
with package Float_Intervals is new Intervals .
Floats ( <> ) ;
use Float_Intervals ;
with package Float_Measures is new Standard .
Measures ( Number ) ;
package Intervals .
Measures is
...
The formal parameters are :
Float_Measures is an instance of the generic package Measures that provides dimensioned floating - point values ( of the type Measure ) ;
Float_Intervals is an instance of the generic package Intervals .
Floats with the same floating - point numeric type ( Number ) .
The type Interval_Measure is defined by the package to represent dimensioned intervals :
type Interval_Measure ( SI : Unit := Units. Base .
Unitless ) is record
From : Number ;
To : Number ;
Offset : Number 'Base ;
end record ;
The discriminant SI and the field Offset determine the dimension of the interval which bounds are specified by the fields From and To .
The numerical values of the bounds in SI units are obtained as From + Offset and To +
Offset correspondingly .
For further information see the description of the package Measures .
The result of all arithmetic operations and conversions is defined to contain the precise value except for the case of an overflow while evaluation of an interval bound .
Depending on the underlying floating - point type and compiler options that may or not result in Constraint_Error exception .
2.1 . Arithmetic
The following arithmetic operations are defined on dimensioned intervals :
function " abs " ( Left : Interval_Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;
function " + " ( Left : Interval_Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;
function " - " ( Left : Interval_Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;
function " ** " ( Left : Interval_Measure ; Right : Number ) return Interval_Measure ;
function " + " ( Left , Right : Interval_Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;
function " + " ( Left : Interval_Measure ; Right : Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;
function " + " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Interval_Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;

function " / " ( Left : Interval_Measure ; Right : Number ) return Interval_Measure ;
function " / " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Interval_Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;
function " / " ( Left : Interval ; Right : Interval_Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;
function " / " ( Left : Number ; Right : Interval_Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;
Binary additive operations " + " and " - " accept as one of the arguments a dimensioned number of the type Float_Measures .
Measure .
Multiplicative binary operations " * " and " / " accept as one of the arguments :
plain number ( of the type Number ) ;
plain interval ( of the type Float_Intervals .
Interval ) ;
dimensioned number ( of the type Float_Measures .
Measure ) .
Additionally " * " and " / " are defined for a dimensioned number and a plain interval .
The exception Unit_Error ( defined in Units ) is propagated on all unit errors as described in Measures .
Constraint_Error is propagated out of multiplicative operations " * " , " / " and exponentiation " ** " when the dimension of the result cannot be represented because of a base unit power overflow .
function " > " ( Left , Right : Interval_Measure ) return Logical ;
function " > " ( Left : Interval_Measure ; Right : Measure ) return Logical ;
function " > " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Interval_Measure ) return Logical ;
function " >= " ( Left , Right : Interval_Measure ) return Logical ;
function " >= " ( Left : Interval_Measure ; Right : Measure ) return Logical ;
function " >= " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Interval_Measure ) return Logical ;
function " <= " ( Left , Right : Interval_Measure ) return Logical ;
function " <= " ( Left : Interval_Measure ; Right : Measure ) return Logical ;
function " <= " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Interval_Measure ) return Logical ;

function " < " ( Left : Interval_Measure ; Right : Measure ) return Logical ;
function " < " ( Left : Measure ; Right : Interval_Measure ) return Logical ;
function " & " ( Left , Right : Interval_Measure ) return Boolean ;
In these relational operations one of the arguments can be a dimensioned value of the type Float_Measures .
Measure .
Differently shifted arguments are allowed , Uint_Error is propagated only if the arguments have incomparable dimensions .
The function " & " returns true if the intersection of Left and Right is not empty .
It is optimistic in the sense that it yields true always when the precise does .
Thus computation errors may lead to a false positive , but never to a false negative .
Equality " = " ( and so inequality " /= " ) is defined as identity .
Uint_Error is not propagated out of them .
2.2 . Operations
function Distance ( Left , Right : Interval_Measure ) return Measure ;
function Distance ( Left : Measure ; Right : Interval_Measure ) return Measure ;
function Distance ( Left : Interval_Measure ; Right : Measure ) return Measure ;
This function returns the interval distance defined as max ( |a - c| , |b - d| ) .

One of the parameters can be a dimensioned value of the type Float_Measures .
Measure .
Differently shifted parameters are allowed .
If Left and Right have different units , the result false .
The implementation is pessimistic in the sense that the result is true only if the precise result is .
It means that due to computation errors the result can be false negative , but never false positive .
function Is_Negative ( Left : Interval_Measure ) return Boolean ;
function Is_Positive ( Left : Interval_Measure ) return Boolean ;
These function test if the argument is negative or positive .
Note that non-positive interval is not necessarily a negative one .

function Length ( Left : Interval_Measure ) return Measure ;
The interval length is defined as b-a .
This function returns an upper bound of the precise result .
2.3 . Conversions
function Convert ( Value : Interval_Measure ; Scale : Measure )
return Interval_Measure ;
This function is used to convert the interval measure Value to the measurement units specified by the parameter Scale .
When offsets of Value and Scale are same this is null operation .
Unit_Error is propagated when conversion is impossible because units of Value and Scale are incompatible .
function Get_Value ( Value : Interval_Measure ) return Interval ;

function To_Interval_Measure ( Left : Measure ) return Interval_Measure ;
function To_Interval_Measure ( Left : Number ) return Interval_Measure ;
function To_Interval_Measure ( Left : Interval ) return Interval_Measure ;
These functions are used for interval composition .
A pair of dimensioned or plain numbers can be used to create a dimensioned interval with the corresponding bounds .
Unit_Error is propagated when the bound have incompatible units or are differently shifted .
The result is dimensionless if the arguments are numeric .
The variants with one argument construct a zero length interval when the argument is a number or a dimensioned number .
When the argument is a plain interval , then the result is a dimensionless one .

By producing " 6 - D " images , an MIT professor and colleagues are creating unusually realistic pictures that not only have a full three - dimensional appearance , but also respond to their environment , producing natural shadows and highlights depending on the direction and intensity of the illumination around them .
Video : Martin Fuchs ; Ramesh Raskar ; Hans - Peter Seidel ; and Hendrik P. A. Lensch
The process can also be used to create images that change over time as the illumination changes , resulting in animated pictures that move just from changes in the sun 's position , with no electronics or active control .
To create " the ultimate synthetic display , " says Ramesh Raskar , an associate professor at the MIT Media Lab , " the display should respond not just to a change in viewpoint , but to changes in the surrounding light .
" Raskar and his colleagues will describe the system , which is based entirely on an arrangement of lenses and screens , on Aug. 11 at the annual SIGGRAPH ( Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques ) conference of the Association for Computing Machinery held in Los Angeles .
Three - dimensional images , created using a variety of systems that make separate images for each eye , have been around for many decades .
The new MIT process could bring an unprecedented degree of realism to such images .
The basic concept is similar to those inexpensive 3 - D displays sometimes used on postcards and novelty items , that use an overlay of plastic that contains a series of parallel linear lenses that create a visible set of vertical lines over the image .
( It is a different approach from that used to create holograms , which require laser light to create . )
In addition to three - dimensional images , these are sometimes used to present a series of images that change as you view them from different angles from side to side .
This can simulate simple motion , such as a car moving along a road .
By using an array of tiny square lenses instead of the linear ones , such displays can also be made to change as you change the viewing angle up or down — making a " 4 - D " image .
This reveals different views with horizontal as well as vertical movement of the viewer .
The new " lighting aware " system adds additional layers of lenses and screens to add two more dimensions of change .
The image that is seen is then not only based on the position of the viewer , but also on the direction of the illumination .
In an initial test of the principle , Raskar and his team created an image of a glass wine bottle , whose caustic ( a term for the collection of light rays coming from a curved surface ) , shadows and highlights change with the illumination .
" Even if you have the best hologram out there , " explains Raskar , when the angle of the light changes " if I have a hologram of a flower , and a real flower next to it , the hologram does n't look real .
All the shadows and all the reflections on that flower are not mimicked on that hologram .
"
The new system , still in a relatively low - resolution laboratory proof - of - concept , could have applications including pictures used for training purposes , he said .
In training someone how to carry out industrial inspections , an image of the device to be inspected would respond just like a real object when the inspector shines lights on it from different angles , for example .
Because the system is being built by hand from custom - made parts , Raskar says , the present version costs about $ 30 per pixel to make .
Since it takes thousands of pixels to create a recognizable image , practical devices at an affordable price will require significant further development .
" It will be at least 10 years before we have any realistic practical - sized displays , " he estimates .
The main applications ultimately would be for advertising and for entertainment , Raskar says .
A similar system could even be adapted to produce motion pictures and moving computer displays as well , he says .
The research was done in collaboration with Martin Fuchs , Hans - Peter Seidel , and Hendrik P.A. Lensch , all of MPI Informatik , The work was partly funded by Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories .

Spain has seen the future and it is slow , dim and uncomfortable .
A swingeing series of energy - saving measures announced by the Spanish government may be a foretaste of the kind of policies which will be forced upon an energy - hungry industrial world in the coming decades .
To protests from motorists and mockery in parts of the press , the Socialist government plans to cut motorway speed limits to 50 mph and town speeds to 25 mph .
New austerity rules will be imposed on the air conditioning and heating of all public buildings .
Street - lighting will be cut by half .
Almost 50 million low - energy light bulbs will be handed out by the government in an attempt to drive high - consumption bulbs out of the market in the next four years .
The government will also sponsor a project intended to introduce a million electric or hybrid electric - petrol cars on to Spanish roads by 2014 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The sweeping plans , intended to reduce Spain 's huge dependency on imported oil by 10 per cent , were mocked by one newspaper as an " operation light bulb " which was doomed to fail .
However , the Industry Minister , Miguel Sebastian , adopted the celebrated exhortation to patriotism and self - sacrifice of the US President John F Kennedy when he took office in 1961 .
It was time , he said , for Spaniards to " ask not what your country can do for you .
Ask what you can do for your country . "
" Every time we lift our feet off the accelerator , we are improving GDP and employment , " Mr Sebastian said .
" The era of cheap energy has passed . "
The energy shock caused by the boom in oil prices in the past year has hit Spain especially hard .
Spain has scant energy resources of its own and is more dependent on fossil fuels for its energy needs – 84 per cent – than any other European Union country .
Mr Sebastian said that Spain had spent € 17bn ( £ 13 bn ) on importing oil in the past 12 months .
The country 's trade deficit is expected to soar this year by 13 per cent to € 42.8bn .
Among the 31 measures announced to parliament on Tuesday night , there were two or three which would – if implemented – radically change the Spanish way of life .
The speed limit on dual carriageways would be cut from 100 kph to 80 kph ( 50 mph ) .
The urban speed limit would fall to 40 kph ( 25 mph ) .
Despite Spain 's baking summers , air conditioning systems in public buildings would be set no lower than 26C .
In winter , the heating would be limited to 21C .
Hospitals will be exempted , and so will private homes and offices .
The government also plans to remove , or dim , millions of street lights , to reduce their energy consumption by half .
Public transport in many cities will operate into the early hours at the weekends to persuade motorists to leave cars at home .
All Spanish government vehicles will be expected to cover one fifth of their energy needs with bio -fuels .
But a poll of Spanish motorists by a TV channel found little evidence of the JFK spirit .
Manolo of Madrid said : " Tell the minister that things are just fine as they are .
We do n't want to cut our speed .
People would be honking their horns all the time if they had to go that slow . "
Everyone can recognize me as a die - hard code - generation fan , with a twist : use a model as the starting point .
I adopted the idea every week , practicing “ dog fooding ” , using my own code generation project AjGenesis .
This week , I ’m reading the now classic book “ Code Generation in Action ” , by Jack Herrington , edited by Manning .
This book is a “ must be read ” to everyone interested in code generation .
It ’s a very interesting reading for developers , but also to managers : the author makes the case for use code generation , appealing to increasing quality and productivity , including agile teams .
In the first chapter , Herrington lists top ten rules I want to comment in this blog .
The indented paragraphs are textual excerpts from the book ( section 1.7 ) , followed by my own comments :
Give the proper respect to hand - coding
You should both respect and loathe handwritten code .
You should respect it because there are often special cases integrated into code that are overlooked with a cursory inspection .
When replacing code you ’ve written by hand , you need to make sure you have the special cases accounted for .
You should loathe hand - code because engineering time is extremely valuable , and to waste it on repetitive tasks is nearly criminal .
The goal of your generator should always be to optimize the organization ’s most valuable assets — the creativity and enthusiasm of the engineering team .
Yes , the basis of code generation is to make easy to delegate the repetive tasks to the machine .
We have to use tools that make easier our work : that ’s the reason we are using compilers nowadays , instead of switching the bits directly in memory ( or setting the relays in the old Eniac ) .
Code generation rationale is not to destroy the handwritten code : its mission is to support it .
Handwrite the code first
You must fully understand your framework before generating code .
Ideally , you should handwrite a significantly broad spectrum of code within the framework first and then use that code as the basis of the templates
for the generator .
Absolutely yes .
Sometimes , new users of AjGenesis begin to use it directly from the examples .
That is good , but it would be better to generate an example using the framework and technology they uses .
If you know how to program using Struts / Hibernate , then , you can separate the variations from the essentials .
At that point , you can begin to write the code generation artifacts ( templates , tasks ) .
Control the source code
I ca n’t stress enough the importance of having a robust source - code control system .
This is critical to a successful code - generation project .
If your generator works directly on implementation files that contain some hand - written code , make sure you have a versioning system running that can protect your work .
Another path : if you generate the code from a model , check in only the model .
The rest of the artifacts will come from code generation process .
With the current technology , you ca n’t generate ALL the solution , but you can separate , with care , the generated part from the manual one .
Make a considered decision about the implementation language
The tools you use to build the generator do not have to be the same tools you use to write the application .
The problem that the generator is trying to solve is completely different from the problem being solved by the application .
For that reason , you should look at the generator as an independent project and pick your tools accordingly .
That is one of the reasons that supports my adoption of a new language ( affectionately named AjBasic ) for my code generation tool AjGenesis .
I wanted a dynamic language under my control , to extend in any direction the code generation process requires .
In one of my initial test , I tried PHP , but I prefer to have a dedicated language .
Integrate the generator into the development process
The generator is a tool to be used by engineers ; thus , it should fit cleanly within their development process .
If it is appropriate , it can integrate with the integrated development environment ( IDE ) , or in the build process or check - in process .
Making the core of AjGenesis as a class library , it could be integrated to other tools .
You can use from NAnt , for example .
An IDE tool calling AjGenesis is a pending task .
Include warnings
Your generator should always place warnings around code that it generates so that people do not hand - tweak the code .
If they hand - tweak the code and rerun the generator , they will lose their revisions .
In addition , your first response to people ignoring the warnings should be to help them and not to berate them .
The fact that they are using your tool is a big step .
Learn why they needed to ignore the warnings and improve the generator or the documentation .
You are the emissary of your tool .
In AjGenesis , this issue is the concern of the templates the user writes .
You can add any text you like : that ’s the power of writting your own templates , you have the ownership of the generated code .
Make it friendly
Just because a generator is a tool for programmers does n’t mean it gets to be rude .
The generator should tell the engineer what it ’s doing , and what files it has altered or created , and handle its errors with a reasonable amount of decorum .
It may sound silly , but a tool that is difficult to use or that ’s flaky will be ignored and your efforts will be wasted .
AjGenesis core is a dll , that can be invoked from any application .
Years ago , I wrote tasks to use it from NAnt .
Thanks to Jonathan Cisneros , we have now the AjGenesis Studio , since last year .
I improved the original code at the beginning of 2008 , adding AjGenesis Web Studio .
The error handling must be improved , specially for new users of AjBasic .
Include documentation
Good documentation is a selling point for the generator .
Your documentation should be thorough but not overwhelming , and should highlight the key points : what the generator does , how it is installed , how it is
run , and what files it affects .
Actually , is a point not very covered by AjGenesis .
But in exchange , there are many blog posts explaning the process , ideas , and examples ( AjGenesis posts ) ( AjGenesis posts in Spanish ) .
Users of the tool are beginning to write too ( read Carlos Marcelo Santos posts ) .
There is an Spanish email list where the users can discuss the tool ( Code Generation group ) .
And in the Codeplex project page , there are examples for Java , .NET , and PHP , many of these using the same model ( the litmus test ) .
Keep in mind that generation is a cultural issue
Educating your colleagues through documentation , seminars , and one - on - one meetings is critical to successfully deploying the generator .
People are skeptical of new things , and a good programmer is twice as skeptical as the average person .
You need to break through those concerns and doubts and emphasize that you designed the generator for their benefit .
I gave three to four speech by year , only dedicated to explain the tool and its potential .
Additionaly , I explain the tool in every course I give ( Java , . NET , PHP , or software development in general ) .
But to be adopted in a company or project , a power user must became the champion of the tool .
It ’s not easy to raise the level of abstraction , write the model and its transformation , in the middle of the day to day work .
Maintain the generator
Unless the generator is just a temporary measure , it will need to be maintained long term .
If the generator manages a large portion of code , treat it just as you would an engineer maintaining that same piece of code .
Your budget should include dedicated time and money for maintaining and upgrading that resource .
AjGenesis is not the “ things ” to maintain .
They are the templates and tasks you use in your work .
If you adopt the tool to generate .NET applications , you have to change and improve the templates when new tech appears ( LINQ , ASP. NET MVC …. ) .
And when you gain experience , you have to improve the model itself , if you discover new ways to represent the product lines your company are involved .
I could add some points more :
– The generated code generated must be the kind of code you are proud to write by yourself .
The tools should not dictate the form and appearance of such code .
– The use of a model raise the level of abstraction .
Such strategy separates the wheat from the chaff , put the technicalities in the place they deserve : the importance is in the model
Well , enough for now .
As you can notice , code generation is one of the subject that passionate me .
It ’s not the silver bullet .
But it is a bullet I want to have , just in case .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The music and film industries launched a fight back against online piracy on Thursday , persuading the six biggest Internet providers to send warning letters to those suspected of illegal file - sharing .
Some 6 million people are thought to engage in illegal file - sharing each year and the trend has cost the music and film industries millions in lost revenue .
ISPs had previously argued they were mere conduits and not responsible for content .
But they agreed to the deal after the government said it would impose legislation if they did not work to curb illegal file - sharing .
Analysts said the plan would likely scare off younger users of illegal sites , who download content often without their parent ’s knowledge , but would need to be just the first step in an escalating battle .
“ You could quite easily wipe off a million people from illegal file sharing sites in the UK , and if that is achieved , then that would be one of the largest single successes ever against file sharing , ” Jupiter analyst Mark Mulligan told Reuters .
“ But that will not be enough . ”
The plan follows moves by France to engage Internet service providers in tackling copyright infringement on their networks and as countries such as Australia , Denmark , Japan and New Zealand launch similar discussions .
A Google search page is reflected in the eye of a computer user in Leicester , in this July 20 , 2007 file photo .

SIGNIFICANT STEP
Under the deal drawn up by the government , Virgin Media , BSkyB , Carphone Warehouse , BT , Orange and Tiscali have agreed to work towards a “ significant reduction ” in the illegal sharing of content .
They will send letters to prolific illegal downloaders each week under a three - month trial , warning them that they are being monitored .
The ISPs and rights holders will then work together with the media regulator Ofcom to come up with a Code of Practice on how to act if this does not work .
Options could include a three - strikes - and - you ’re - out warning , traffic shaping to slow access for those who are either illegally uploading or downloading , or filtering to prevent illegal tracks from being downloaded .
The content industries will also work to educate consumers about illegal downloading and further develop a range of legal services in addition to their previous approach of suing those who engaged in illegally downloading files .
“ The UK agreement is a big step towards reaching a solution to online piracy , and it shows that the process of engaging ISPs that was set in motion in France last year is gathering real momentum internationally , ” said John Kennedy , the head of the IFPI body which oversees the music industry .
The UK Film Council also welcomed the announcement as a significant first step .
Music companies have been trying desperately to boost digital sales in recent years following the growth of Internet piracy which has cut into CD sales .
A host of downloading services have developed on the Internet in recent years , with the most successful being Apple ’s iTunes with over 70 percent of the digital music market .
But the government has said it would still like to see more choice .
BSkyB announced a subscription music service just this week and other ISPs are also working on new downloading services .
Ingrid Betancourt is a rare politician whose personal ordeal made her a heroine in two countries , a charismatic idealist whose endurance through six years of captivity created a shared sympathy between her native Colombia and France , where she grew up and held dual citizenship .
News that Betancourt had been rescued from her Marxist - rebel captors sparked celebrations in both countries .
For Colombians , who knew her as a voice bravely demanding an end to endemic kidnappings , the years spent in chains at the hands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC , had transformed her from a marginal presidential candidate into a symbol of the suffering inflicted by drug- fueled violence .
“ For Colombians , [ her captivity ] was an open wound , ” said Jaime Abello , executive director of the Foundation for a New Iberoamerican Journalism , founded by Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez .
“ It was as if they had captured someone like Obama or Hillary and held them , for years , in terrible conditions . ”
Colombia ’s joy over her release was matched in France , where Betancourt ’s portrait hangs from banners at city halls across the country .
Betancourt , the daughter of a Colombian diplomat and a former Miss Colombia , grew up in France , becoming a notable figure among the left - wing intelligentsia of Paris .
She derived her French citizenship from her first marriage , to Fabrice Delloye , a diplomat .

The French public followed the dashed hopes and despair that marked her imprisonment : the failed rescue attempts , hunger strikes and , in recent months , alarm over reports that she was in failing health and increasingly depressed .
But Betancourt ’s hold on the French psyche went beyond citizenship .
A dark - haired beauty who appeared unafraid to challenge Colombia ’s forces of corruption , she launched a strident campaign for president in 2002 .
Her daring political style -- and the terrible consequences that followed her decision to wade unguarded into the Colombian jungle in pursuit of her ideals -- personified much of the French self - image .
“ It ’s like a great French romance novel with all the elements of adventure and politics and a beautiful woman , ” said Bertrand Vannier , a senior correspondent for Radio France .

Vannier credited Betancourt ’s former husband and two children who live in Paris with keeping her cause in the public eye , engaging France in a campaign to free her .
Public attention intensified last fall after Colombian security forces seized and broadcast a video showing a gaunt Betancourt with her hair grown below her waist , staring mournfully at the ground .
News bulletins on French state radio began issuing weekly reminders about her plight .
And a letter Betancourt wrote to her mother , along with one to her from her children Melanie , 22 , and Lorenzo , 19 , were published in book form last December , a prelude to a national “ day of support ” for all 700 hostages held by the FARC .
On Wednesday , news of her freedom drew about 30 mostly young people to a spontaneous gathering in front of Paris City Hall , where a timer indicating the number of days she had been held hostage had finally stopped at 2,319 .

“ All of France was convinced that they would n’t free her , ” said Celina Jamey , 30 , who came out to mark the end of Betancourt ’s nightmare .
“ This was a big battle for her -- and for France . ”
It was a sentiment shared half a world away , where many hoped the rescue of the FARC ’s trophy hostage would weaken the rebel group .
“ In France she became the new Joan of Arc ; in Colombia , her kidnapping converted her into an icon of the resistance to the FARC , ” said Maria Jimena Duzan , a friend of Betancourt and a columnist for the weekly Semana .
“ There is great jubilation , ” Duzan said .
“ This is a happy ending in a country that is living many tragedies . ”

Back story :
The FARC
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia was established in 1964 as a Communist - inspired peasant army fighting for land reform and better economic conditions .
Advertisement
It was branded a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union , and has been put on the defensive by President Alvaro Uribe ’s U.S. - backed security campaign .
U.S. and Colombian officials say the FARC has used the cocaine trade to fund its operations .
Colombia ’s conflict is now often a fight over drug - producing land among the FARC , right - wing paramilitaries and narcotics gangs .
The FARC still holds sway in some rural areas and keeps other hostages in secret jungle camps .
Ingrid Betancourt and the three U.S. defense contractors were the group ’s most high - profile captives .
It had been seeking to exchange hostages for jailed rebels .
Two top rebel commanders were killed in March .
If you thought you saw a putty tat , you did see a putty tat .
I used to do a lot more animal videos and somehow got away from it .
But it was n't deliberate , so let 's try a few more .
These kitties are smart , resourceful , clever , and unpredictable .
In the first video we look in on one very resourceful kitty , who knows how to get what she wants .
Of course , we end up with a funny result .
This is one thirsty little kitty cat .
Let 's see how she quenches her thirst :

You will have to admit that we have one smart little kitty here .
She was not short changed when they handed out the brains in her family .
Despite being bigger than his opponent , our next feline is a little on the cautious side and wants to make certain that he does n't get into something he can't handle .
So he sort of feels his way into a disagreement .
Once he is sure , he ... well , see for yourself : I think it did not turn out quite the way he expected despite all of his calculations prior to making his move .
That 's life as a cat , kiddo .
Most cats hate the water , but this kitty proves that the term " most cats " does not mean all cats .
This one gets an " A " for the cuteness factor , so get ready to get cuted out .
Was I right ?
Cute , huh ?

( NaturalNews ) Epidemic obesity among children today will lead to a surge in the occurrence of premature heart attacks in strokes as those children age , according to two studies published in the In the first study , researchers from the University of California at San Francisco and Columbia University used computer modeling to predict the likely effects of obesity in children .
The study concluded that obese children are 19 percent more likely to die from heart disease , beginning when they hit age 35 .
" It 's the age and the magnitude that 's so striking to us , " lead author Kirsten Bibbins - Domingo said .
In the second study , researchers from the Institute for Preventive Medicine in Copenhagen , Denmark , analyzed data on 276,835 people who had first been examined in 1930 .
They found that the higher a child 's body mass index had been , the higher their risk of contracting heart disease .
A boy who was in the highest weight category at the age of 13 , they found , had a 33 percent higher risk of cardiovascular problems by age 60 .
" What 's even more disturbing is that the highest weight category among Danish children would barely make it out of the normal range for U.S. kids , " said David Ludwig of the Children 's Hospital in Boston , who was not involved in the study but wrote an accompanying commentary .
A prior study authored by Ludwig found that obesity could result in children 's life being shortened by two to five years .
The results have been controversial , in part because new medications are increasing the life expectancy of heart disease patients even as the disease becomes more prevalent .
"
The entire argument will be irrelevant , once the full effects of the childhood obesity epidemic are felt , " Ludwig said .
Bibbins - Domingo called for widespread action to confront the health threat posed by childhood obesity .
" This is a problem that requires sweeping policy changes at all levels to make sure our children have access to healthy foods , physical activity , and safe spaces to exercise , because they are at the root of preventing weight gain in childhood , " she
In January , the bank introduced a Z$ 10 m note
Zimbabwe is to introduce a bank - note worth Z$ 100bn in response to rampant inflation - but the note will barely cover the cost of a loaf of bread .
Some Zimbabweans are already calling for higher denominations in a country where the official annual inflation rate has exceeded 2,200,000 % .
Independent economists believe the real rate is many times higher .
Zimbabwe 's meltdown has left at least 80 % of the population in poverty , facing mass shortages of basic goods .
The country 's central bank has introduced several new notes already this year in response to the hyperinflation .
In January , a Z$ 10 million note was issued , followed by a Z$ 50 million .
By June the denominations had reached tens of billions .
Daily bread
In a notice in the state - controlled Herald newspaper , central bank governor Gideon Gono said the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe would introduce the new notes - known as special agro-cheques - to help consumers .
" This new $ 100 billion special agro-cheque will go into circulation on Monday , " the notice said .
But Zimbabwe residents say the latest note is already worthless , and does not even cover their daily lunch .
" Nowadays , for my expenses a day , I need about Z$ 500 billion , " one resident said .
" So Z$ 100 billion can't do anything because for me to go home I need Z$ 250 billion , so this [ note ] is worthless . "
Zimbabwe was once one of the richest countries in Africa .
But it has descended into economic chaos in recent years , with many international observers blaming the policies of President Robert Mugabe .

Please remember that this is just a simulation .
Although the CO2 emission , birth rate and death rate data used in Breathing Earth comes from reputable sources , data that measures things on such a massive scale can never be 100 % accurate .
Please note however that the CO2 emission levels shown here are much more likely to be too low than they are to be too high .
The Environment and Climate Change
Global warming ( aka climate change ) is almost without a doubt the most important issue to face our generation , and quite possibly any generation in history .
The worldwide scientific community is virtually unanimous in its agreement that global warming is happening , that it 's our fault , and that our chance to stop it is slipping away .
If we let it get out of our control , the consequences - which will already begin occuring in most of our lifetimes - will be catastrophic .
Just some of the consequences that can be reasonably expected are rising sea levels , more frequent and more severe natural disasters , large - scale food and water shortages , plagues , massive species extinctions , unprecendented numbers of refugees , intensified ethnic and political tensions , and a global economic depression the likes of which no one has ever seen .
The situation is still within our grasp , but we must act now , we must act strongly , and we must act together .
Individuals , companies , and governments across the globe must each do what they can to reverse climate change .
We will never get a second chance .
What can I do ?
The good news is that there are plenty of things that we can do to reduce our carbon footprint .
The key word is reduce .
We can greatly lessen our impact on climate change by using the planet 's resources more responsibly .
There are many things we can reduce , and many ways we can reduce them , but three of the major ones are : reduce the amount of animal products you consume ( meat , dairy , eggs , leather , etc. ) , reduce the amount of fuel you use ( car , air travel , etc. ) , and reduce the amount of electricity you use .
There are plenty of good resources on the web .
I encourage you to do your own research , though you might find some of the links below to be useful .

Where does the data come from ?
Birth and death rates : 2010 estimates , from the CIA World Factbook
Population : Data is based on July 2010 estimates from the CIA World Factbook .
When Breathing Earth is started , it uses each country 's birth and death rates to calculate how populations have changed since July 2010 , and adjusts its figures accordingly .
It continues adjusting the various population figures as you watch it , each time a person is born or a person dies .
CO2 emission rates : 2006 figures from the United Nations Statistics Division .
These are the most up - to - date figures as of October 2010 .
Collating CO2 emissions data for every country on Earth , representing the same time period , is undoubtedly a massive and very complex task that relies on the availability of many other sets of data .
This probably explains why the most recent CO2 emissions data available is from 2006 .
CO2 emission rates from four years earlier : When Breathing Earth was first built , it used 2002 figures , also from the United Nations Statistics Division .
When you hover your mouse over a country , Breathing Earth compares the 2002 and 2006 figures and indicates whether that country 's CO2 emissions have increased or decreased in that time , using the red or green arrow that appears near the bottom - left .
There was an unavailability of a portion of the data for a few of the tinier countries ( eg. Vanuatu , Tuvalu , Lesotho ) .
In such cases , I made estimates based on their population , economy , and the data of their relevant neighbours .
In all such cases , the figures were so low that even had my estimates been wildly inaccurate , the effect on the simulation would have been negligible .
CO2 emissions : per country or per capita ?
Some people ask why Breathing Earth focuses on the CO2 emissions per country , rather than per capita .
After all , would n't the per capita rates give a better indication of who is being most wasteful ?
For example , the citizens of Australia , Kuwait and Luxembourg are among the world 's worst polluters , yet their CO2 emissions are n't very prominent on Breathing Earth because of those countries ' relatively low populations .
The fact of the matter , however , is that what is most important is how many c02 emissions there are from the perspective of Planet Earth .
Although some countries are clearly much worse polluters than others , the problem is ultimately a global one that humans of various nationalities have caused , and that humans of various nationalities must work together to solve .
One thing must surely be obvious though :
The problem is largely a Western one .
It is the Western countries who are leading the way in CO2 emissions , and when non-Western countries have high CO2 emission rates themselves , it 's usually because they are adopting Western habits .
Since we , the West , have been a leading cause of the CO2 emissions problem , surely it is we who must step up and be the leaders in the solution .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Thursday blamed the " two oil men in the White House , " President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , and their Republican allies in Congress for gas prices exceeding $ 4 a gallon .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she does not plan to permit a vote to lift a ban on offshore oil drilling .
Pelosi , a California Democrat , said multiple initiatives intended to lower high energy costs have passed the Democratically controlled House only to " run into a brick wall " in the Senate because they did not receive the 60 votes needed to overcome Republican filibusters .
" The price of oil is ... is attributed to two oil men in the White House and their protectors in the United States Senate , " Pelosi said in an interview with CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
Pelosi said she would continue to oppose two policy changes that President Bush and congressional Republicans have been advocating : lifting the ban on offshore drilling and opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration .
Watch Pelosi argue against more drilling »
Pelosi said she had no plans to allow votes to lift a ban on offshore drilling despite widespread support for the move .
A recent CNN poll conducted by the Opinion Research Corp. found that 72 percent of those polled supported more offshore drilling .
About a quarter -- 27 percent -- backed Pelosi 's position .
The poll , conducted June 26 - 29 , has a margin of error of plus - or - minus 3 percentage points .
Pelosi said there are plenty of opportunities that oil companies should explore before environmentally sensitive areas such as ANWR are open to drilling , pointing to the 33 million acres that have already been approved for offshore drilling and the 68 million acres of federal land in the lower 48 states that is open to exploration .
" The impression that the White House has given you is that if you could drill in these protected areas , the price of gasoline will come down , " Pelosi said .
" Even the president in his press conference the other day acknowledged that that was not the case . "
Watch Pelosi call Bush a ' total failure ' »
Pelosi's renewed opposition to more drilling comes as two bipartisan groups -- one in the House , the other in the Senate -- are trying to rekindle stalled energy legislation by forging a compromise to expand domestic oil and gas drilling .
The compromise would include new domestic drilling to satisfy Republicans and promote conservation and alternative energy sources to satisfy Democrats , lawmakers said .
Despite Pelosi and the Democratic leadership opposing efforts to repeal a 1981 law barring most offshore drilling , the Senate group said its plan probably would allow offshore drilling in new areas of the outer continental shelf .
Watch Pelosi say she is ' disappointed ' in Congress »
Sen .
Ben Nelson , D - Nebraska , is bucking his party 's leadership by supporting new drilling .
He said he and the other senators advocating the deal are " people who are all seriously concerned about the issue who want to find solutions that are most likely to involve compromise . "
Another group member , Sen. Johnny Isakson , R - Georgia , said , " Somebody around here 's got to do it .
We think the Senate can vote in the majority for energy proposals that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce the pressure on gas prices . "
The Senate group met behind closed doors Wednesday at the Capitol , seeking to forge legislation that could be introduced after the August recess .
Talks were to continue later in the week , according to one senator who attended the meeting .
In the House , the bipartisan " energy working group " -- formed by Reps. John Peterson , R - Pennsylvania , and Neil Abercrombie , D - Hawaii -- includes 23 members , roughly split between the two parties .
Peterson said energy legislation should be the priority for Congress and said he hopes the group can yield a comprehensive plan next week .
" Leaders are going to have a hard time refusing to address this issue .
This is the issue of the year .
This is the issue of the decade , " Peterson said .
Another member of the group , Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia , said that " everything is on the table " except drilling in Alaska 's ANWR , which he described as a " lightning rod . "
CNN 's Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .

The not - quite - concluded racial drama playing out at Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis ( IUPUI ) in the last months can't be ranked with the embittering rape charge scandal at Duke that so recently mesmerized the nation .
And as news it 's not in the same league as the total war waged against Harvard president Lawrence Summers for having had the temerity to suggest that factors in addition to prejudice might have something to do with the underrepresentation of women in math and the sciences .
Still , what happened at IUPUI is a pungent reminder of all that 's possible now in the rarefied ideological atmosphere on our college campuses – and in this presidential election year , not perhaps only on our campuses .
The story began prosaically enough .
Keith Sampson , a student employee on the janitorial staff earning his way toward a degree , was in the habit of reading during work breaks .
Last October he was immersed in " Notre Dame Vs. the Klan : How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan . "
Mr. Sampson was in short order visited by his union representative , who informed him he must not bring this book to the break room , and that he could be fired .
Taking the book to the campus , Mr. Sampson says he was told , was " like bringing pornography to work . "
That it was a history of the battle students waged against the Klan in the 1920s in no way impressed the union rep .
The assistant affirmative action officer who next summoned the student was similarly unimpressed .
Indeed she was , Mr. Sampson says , irate at his explanation that he was , after all , reading a scholarly book .
" The Klan still rules Indiana , " Marguerite Watkins told him – did n't he know that ?
Mr. Sampson , by now dazed , pointed out that this book was carried in the university library .
Yes , she retorted , you can get Klan propaganda in the library .
Oh no !

Out West , a showdown is under way over open access to " America 's Operating System , " the law .
As we reported last month , the State of Oregon is n't keen on having its Revised Statutes republished in full , for free , by Internet archives like public .
resource.org and Justia .
The sites got into a kerfuffle with the state over the information and have since refused to take out a " public " license .
While Oregon backed down from its initial cease - and - desist notice , the two sides still cannot come to an agreement .
Justia and public .
resource.org have since retained counsel to deal with the issue , and their lawyer has already made clear to Oregon that his clients will be posting the entirety of the disputed material by June 2 .
While you might think a state would want the laws it passes widely disseminated , the reality is that Oregon makes money licensing its statutes to publishers .
State laws are not themselves copyrighted , of course , but Oregon claims that all the ancillary material in the Revised Statutes — including section numbers and headings — is copyrighted .
Stripping out the public domain law without including the copyrighted bits would be a " pain in the ass , " according to public.resource.org 's Carl Malamud , who tells
Ars that the issue here is much bigger than Oregon .
It 's a " question of assertion of copyright over cases and codes , " and it's a " fundamental issue " that affects access to the law .
In Malamud 's view , the extra information in question is just " pasting a private wrapper on a public package " in order to monetize it , but given that the additional information is added by Oregon 's Legislative Counsel ( a state entity ) , Malamud does n't believe that even this claim stands up to scrutiny .
When the debate first flared up , response was quick .
Google 's William Patry opined that Oregon had gone " wacka wacka huna kuna , " which we 're pretty sure is n't a compliment .
Malamud and his cohorts at Justia got on the phone with Oregon officials , who ended up proposing a " public license . "
In a letter dated April 30 , though , Malamud pointed out that C - SPAN 's copyright policy was only 318 words .
By contrast , the " public license " offered by Oregon was 2,739 words long and was " incompatible with how public domain data is distributed . "
On May 2 , the lawyer for both Malamud and Justia informed Oregon that his clients could not accept the license and would be posting the material in question with or without an agreement by June 2 .
On his blog , Justia founder Tim Stanley argued that the issue was worth fighting over .
" To otherwise permit the State of Oregon or any other governmental body to restrict access to the laws that govern all of us would make a mockery of the legal doctrine that all persons have presumed knowledge of the law , " he said in April .
" Fortunately , many courts have rightfully declined to recognize such copyright claims asserted by states and municipalities . "
When I spoke with Malamud today , he promised that action would be taken soon .
Is that a tumbleweed I see blowing across the plains ?

Tell me something that I do not already know !
For the past month or so , I have noticed that people at my office did not go to Starbucks as often as they used to do – myself included .
It used to be that we would go almost everyday , especially if we had a particularly long meeting .
We definitely needed grandes during those times .
Today , though , it is either we brew our own pot at the office – we ’re lucky to have a drip coffee machine , we just take turns buying the beans – or we buy cheaper coffee at a local store .
It seems that the rest of the United States is doing the same thing .
Based on Kelly Blue Book ’s monthly survey :
The June 2008 study results reveal that 28 percent of new - car shoppers have stopped going to Starbucks or other coffee houses entirely , and 21 percent indicate they are going less often due to skyrocketing gas prices .
Though the study focused on new - car shoppers , I would not be surprised to hear the same trend happening with other groups of people .
Imagine spending $ 2 on Starbucks a day .
Do a little math – this adds up to $ 40 a month ( 5 - day week ) and $ 480 a year !
What if you used that money for gas instead ?
You ’d be able to buy 120 gallons of gas at $ 4 per gallon .
Not a surprising result then , huh ?
It ’s perfectly normal when hard economic times hit , the non-essentials are first to go …
How often do you still go to Starbucks or any other coffee shop for that matter ?
Andrew Morton on kernel development
LWN .net needs you !
Without subscribers , LWN would simply not exist .
Please consider signing up for a subscription and helping to keep LWN publishing
Andrew Morton is well - known in the kernel community for doing a wide variety of different tasks : maintaining the - mm tree for patches that may be on their way to the mainline , reviewing lots of patches , giving presentations about working with the community , and , in general , handling lots of important and visible kernel development chores .
Things are changing in the way he does things , though , so we asked him a few questions by email .
He responded at length about the - mm tree and how that is changing with the advent of linux - next , kernel quality , and what folks can do to help make the kernel better .
Years ago , there was a great deal of worry about the possibility of burning out Linus .
Life seems to have gotten easier for him since then ; now instead , I 've heard concerns about burning out Andrew .
It seems that you do a lot ; how do you keep the pace and how long can we expect you to stay at it ?
have to - you can't do the same thing at a high level of intensity for over five years and stay sane .
I do less than I used to .
Mainly because Ito - you can't do the same thing at a high level of intensity for over five years and stay sane .
I 'm still keeping up with the reviewing and merging but the - mm release periods are now far too long .
There are of course many things which I should do but which I do not .
Over the years my role has fortunately decreased - more maintainers are running their own trees and the introduction of the linux - next tree ( operated by Stephen Rothwell ) has helped a lot .
The linux - next tree means that 85 % of the code which I used to redistribute for external testing is now being redistributed by Stephen .
Some time in the next month or two I will dive into my scripts and will find a way to get the sufficiently - stable parts of the - mm tree into linux - next and then I will hopefully be able to stop doing - mm releases altogether .
So .
The work level is ramping down , and others are taking things on .
What can we do to help ?
I think code review would be the main thing .
It 's a pretty specialised function to review new code well .
The people who specialise in the area which the new code is changing are the best reviewers but unfortunately I will regularly find myself having to review someone else 's stuff .
Secondly : it would help if people 's patches were less buggy .
I still have to fix a stupidly large number of compile warnings and compilation errors and each - mm release requires me to perform probably three or four separate bisection searches to weed out bad patches .
Thirdly : testing , testing , testing .
Fourthly : it 's stupid how often I end up being the primary responder on bug reports .
I 'll typically read the linux - kernel list in 1000 - email batches once every few days and each time I will come across multiple bug reports which are one to three days old and which nobody has done anything about !
And sometimes I know that the person who is responsible for that part of the kernel has read the report .
grr .
Is it your opinion that the quality of the kernel is in decline ?
Most developers seem to be pretty sanguine about the overall quality problem .
Assuming there 's a difference of opinion here , where do you think it comes from ?
How can we resolve it ?
I used to think it was in decline , and I think that I might think that it still is .
I see so many regressions which we never fix .
Obviously we fix bugs as well as add them , but it is very hard to determine what the overall result of this is .
When I 'm out and about I will very often hear from people whose machines we broke in ways which I 'd never heard about before .
I ask them to send a bug report ( expecting that nothing will end up being done about it ) but they rarely do .
So I do n't know where we are and I do n't know what to do .
All I can do is to encourage testers to report bugs and to be persistent with them , and I continue to stick my thumb in developers ' ribs to get something done about them .
I do think that it would be nice to have a bugfix - only kernel release .
One which is loudly publicised and during which we encourage everyone to send us their bug reports and we 'll spend a couple of months doing nothing else but try to fix them .
I have n't pushed this much at all , but it would be interesting to try it once .
If it is beneficial , we can do it again some other time .
There have been a number of kernel security problems disclosed recently .
Is any particular effort being put into the prevention and repair of security holes ?
What do you think we should be doing in this area ?
People continue to develop new static code checkers and new runtime infrastructure which can find security holes .
But a security hole is just a bug - it is just a particular type of bug , so one way in which we can reduce the incidence rate is to write less bugs .
See above .
More careful coding , more careful review , etc .
Now , is there any special pattern to a security - affecting bug ?
One which would allow us to focus more resources on preventing that type of bug than we do upon preventing " average " bugs ?
Well , perhaps .
If someone were to sit down and go through the past five years ' worth of kernel security bugs and pull together an overall picture of what our commonly - made security - affecting bugs are , then that information could perhaps be used to guide code - reviewers ' efforts and code - checking tools .
That being said , I have the impression that most of our " security holes " are bugs in ancient crufty old code , mainly drivers , which nobody runs and which nobody even loads .
So most metrics and measurements on kernel security holes are , I believe , misleading and unuseful .
Those security - affecting bugs in the core kernel which affect all kernel users are rare , simply because so much attention and work gets devoted to the core kernel .
This is why the recent splice bug was such a surprise and head - slapper .
I have sensed that there is a bit of confusion about the difference between - mm and linux - next .
How would you describe the purpose of these two trees ?
Which one should interested people be testing ?
Well , things are in flux at present .
The - mm tree used to consist of the following : 80 - odd subsystem maintainer trees ( git and quilt ) , eg : scsi , usb , net .
various patches which I picked up which should be in a subsystem maintainer 's tree , but which for one of various reasons did n't get merged there .
I spend a lot of time acting as backup for leaky maintainers .
be in a subsystem maintainer 's tree , but which for one of various reasons did n't get merged there .
I spend a lot of time acting as backup for leaky maintainers .
patches which are mastered in the - mm tree .
These are now organised as subsystems too , and I count about 100 such subsystems which are mastered in - mm .
eg : fbdev , signals , uml , procfs .
And memory management .
more speculative things which are n't intended for mainline in the short - term , such as new filesystems ( eg reiser4 ) .
debugging patches which I never intend to go upstream .
The 80 - odd subsystem trees in fact account for 85 % of the changes which go into Linux .
Pretty much all of the remaining 15 % are the only - in - mm patches .
Right now ( at 2.6.26 - rc4 in " kernel time " ) , the 80 - odd subsystem trees are in linux - next .
I now merge linux - next into - mm rather than the 80 - odd separate trees .
As mentioned previously , I plan to move more of - mm into linux - next - the 100 - odd little subsystem trees .
Once that has happened , there is n't really much left in - mm .
Just the patches which subsystem maintainers leaked .
I send these to the subsystem maintainers .
the speculative not - for - next - release features
the not - to - be- merged debugging patches .
Do you have any specific goals for the development of the kernel over the next year or so ?
What would they be ?
Steady as she goes , basically .
I keep on hoping that kernel development in general will start to ramp down .
There can not be an infinite number of new features out there !
Eventually we should get into more of a maintenance mode where we just fix bugs , tweak performance and add new drivers .
Famous last words .
And it 's just vaguely possible that we 're starting to see that happening now .
I do get a sense that there are less " big " changes coming in .
When I sent my usual 1000 - patch stream at Linus for 2.6.26 I actually received an email from him asking ( paraphrased ) " hey , where 's all the scary stuff ? "
In the early - May discussions , Linus said a couple of times that he does not think code review helps much .
Do you agree with that point of view ?
Nope .
How would you describe the real role of code review in the kernel development process ?
Well , it finds bugs .
It improves the quality of the code .
Sometimes it prevents really really bad things from getting into the product .
Such as rootholes in the core kernel .
I 've spotted a decent number of these at review time .
It also increases the number of people who have an understanding of the new code - both the reviewer (s ) and those who closely followed the review are now better able to support that code .
Also , I expect that the prospect of receiving a close review will keep the originators on their toes - make them take more care over their work .
There clearly must be quite a bit of communication between you and Linus , but much of it , it seems , is out of the public view .
Could you describe how the two of you work together ?
How are decisions ( such as when to release ) made ?
Actually we hardly ever say anything much .
We 'll meet face - to - face once or twice a year and " hi how 's it going " .
We each know how the other works and I hope we find each other predictable and that we have no particular issues with the other 's actions .
There just does n't seem to be much to say , really .
Is there anything else you would like to say to LWN 's readers ?
Sure .
Please do contribute to Linux , and a great way of doing that is to test latest mainline or linux - next or - mm and to report on any problems which you encounter .
Nothing special is needed - just install it on as many machines as you dare and use them in your normal day - to - day activities .
If you do hit a bug ( and you will ) then please be persistent in getting us to fix it .
Do n't let us release a kernel with your bug in it !
Shout at us if that 's what it takes .
Just do n't let us break your machines .
Our testers are our greatest resource - the whole kernel project would grind to a complete halt without them .
I profusely thank them at every opportunity I get :)

The squeeze on Hillary Clinton to relinquish the Democratic presidential nomination appeared to be intensifying last night , as party officials edged towards rejecting her demand that all votes cast in the disputed primary contests in Michigan and Florida be counted .
As they did so , there came news from the campaign of Senator Barack Obama that he has resigned from his church in Chicago in the continuing aftermath of inflammatory remarks by former pastor the Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
These were an issue his opponents were unlikely to have left unexploited .
But the main drama was taking place in a Washington hotel .
Meeting amid high emotion under the scrutiny of demonstrators and TV cameras , members of the party ’s rules and bylaws committee worked late into the evening on a compromise package that would only partially legitimise the results of the primaries in both states .
At stake were 368 delegates from Michigan and Florida whose status has been in limbo because of an earlier decision to punish those states for holding their primaries too early .
Before yesterday , the position was that none of those delegates would be seated at the party convention in August .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mrs Clinton and Barack Obama did not campaign in either state , and in Michigan , Mr Obama was not even on the ballot .
A compromise deal will mean a net gain of delegates for Mrs Clinton , but it will not help significantly to dent the delegate lead already held by Mr Obama .
This was Mrs Clinton ’s last best hope of stopping the Obama train , but with no sign yesterday that the rules committee was inclined to go that far , the endgame is now upon her .
All that remains are primaries in Puerto Rico today and Montana and South Dakota on Tuesday .
It will then be for remaining uncommitted super - delegates to end the fight .
The dilemma faced by the rules committee and the party as a whole regarding Michigan and Florida was not small .
While wanting to protect its right to enforce party rules , it also faces pressure not to be seen to be disenfranchising the voters of two states that will be vital in November .
For that reason , the Obama camp quickly made clear it was open to compromise , even if it meant narrowing its candidate ’s delegate lead .
Speaking on behalf of the Obama campaign with regard to Florida , Congressman Robert Wexler told the rules committee that “ Florida certainly deserves to play a key
role in the nominating process ” .
He added , however , that Florida ’s contest “ was not a normal primary election ” and a 100 per cent reinstatement of its delegates would be unjust .
Mr Wexler thus came out to endorse reseating all Florida delegates with a half vote for each , a move that would give Mrs Clinton a net gain of 19 .
“ Senator Obama should be commended for his willingness to offer this concession , ” he announced to a ruckus of cheers in the hall .
The notion that Mr Obama was making a concession at all was hotly contested by Clinton lawyer Harold Ickes .
Michigan was a much trickier conundrum , because of the absence of Mr Obama on ballot papers .
The committee was considering the legality of allocating delegates to Mr Obama proportional to the 40 per cent of Michigan primary voters who punched “ uncommitted ” .
Mrs Clinton would get the remainder .

The Obama campaign hopes that once the last votes are cast on Tuesday night , uncommitted super - delegates will come in a rush to his column , allowing him to secure the nomination , possibly before the end of the week .
In a show of confidence – some might say rash chutzpah – Mr Obama will late on Tuesday hold a “ victory rally ” at the same convention centre in St Paul , Minnesota , that will host the Republican Party ’s nominating convention in early September .
The party leadership , including chairman Howard Dean and the speaker of the house , Nancy Pelosi , have made clear they want the nomination struggle resolved as soon as possible after Tuesday .
Withdrawing this week is one option for the former first lady .
But she has others , including appealing whatever ruling on Florida and Michigan emerges this weekend , perhaps all the way to the Denver convention .
She is perfectly entitled to do so , even if it would give party grandees the shivers because of the damage it would do to unity .
Mrs Clinton argues that she is ahead of Mr Obama in popular votes in the primary marathon , if not delegates .
That may just be true if you do count all votes cast in Florida and Michigan .
With that , and with the wide victory she expects to score in Puerto Rico tonight , Mrs Clinton may make one last desperate pitch to super - delegates to side with her .
Meanwhile , Mr Obama ’s choice of St Paul for his Tuesday event is raising eyebrows .
“ It ’s not too subtle , ” said University of Minnesota political scientist Larry Jacobs .

We love Ikea .
Cheap furniture , endless parts for hacking projects and of course , the knowledge that you are no longer an individual bu that you share your tastes with half of the entire developed world .
Ikea 's innovation was to cut storage and transport costs with flat - pack furniture , and at the same time bring some simple and attractive design to mass manufacturing .
Now the Swedish company plans to bring this buying power to alternative energy .
Johan Stenebo of Ikea spinoff company Greentech will invest $ 75 million in solar companies and wants the retail giant to start selling the products in Ikea store in two to four years .
And it wo n't just be solar .
Water saving products and other environmentally friendly tech will also find their way into the blue and yellow superstores .
This is huge .
One of the biggest hurdles to solar power is cost .
If Ikea can drive those prices down , and also make them easy to buy , solar could really be coming to the mass market .
Of course , all the gas you use driving back to the store to collect the missing screws might offset the the environmental benefits a little .
IKEA Puts $ U.S. 75 Million Toward Cheap Solar [ Tree Hugger ]
The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit today upheld a ban on the enforcement of the Child Online Protection Act ( COPA ) , ruling once again that it was unconstitutional , overbroad , and vague .
The American Civil Liberties Union , which challenged COPA on behalf of a coalition of writers , artists and health educators , hailed the ruling as a victory for free speech .
" For years the government has been trying to thwart freedom of speech on the Internet , and for years the courts have been finding the attempts unconstitutional , " said Chris Hansen , senior staff attorney with the ACLU First Amendment Working Group .
" The government has no more right to censor the Internet than it does books and magazines . "
COPA was originally passed by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in 1998 and was meant to protect children from " harmful " content on the Internet .
Unfortunately for proponents of the law , its wording was very broad and would have required website operators to implement a number of measures to enforce " contemporary community standards . "
According to the ACLU blog , it would have even barred adults from seeing material that was not appropriate for a child and would have affected , among other things , the online availability of sexual health information .
Opponents of the law sued to block enforcement almost immediately , and in the ten years since the law was passed , it has never been enforced .
Instead , it worked its way through the system for years .
In 2002 , the Supreme Court instructed a Circuit Court to reconsider its ruling preventing the law 's enforcement .
The Supreme Court blocked enforcement of COPA in 2004 , again sending the law back down to the District Court for further study .
In 2007 , the District Court struck down the law yet again , ruling it unconstitutional and issuing a permanent injunction against its enforcement .
The court found that COPA violated the First and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution , ruling that " COPA prohibits much more speech than is necessary to further Congress ' compelling interest . "
Not one to take failure lying down , the government appealed the decision , bringing us to where we are today .
In a unanimous decision , the court ruled ( PDF ) that COPA was " not narrowly tailored " enough to serve the government 's goal of protecting children from content on the Internet , it was was not the least restrictive means available , and was substantially overbroad .
The government now has the same decision to make as it has many times in the past : whether to appeal to the Supreme Court ( again ) , or let it die .
It would n't be a huge surprise to see the case appealed one last time .
" Hopefully [ the government ] will conclude that 10 years of litigation is enough , " notes the ACLU .
We agree .
( Adds government defense of primary surplus , economic health )
BUENOS AIRES , Aug 8 ( Reuters ) - Argentina ’s government bond spreads , a gauge of investor aversion to risk , widened to their highest level since the country ’s massive 2005 restructuring of defaulted debt , due to concerns over its financing outlook .
Argentina 's spreads widened by more than 40 basis points to nearly 730 basis points over U.S. Treasuries in late trade on Friday , according to JP Morgan 's Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus ( EMBI + ) 11EMJ.JPMEMBIPLUS .
Despite growth in Latin America ’s No. 3 economy , its trade and fiscal surpluses , and high foreign reserves , the center - left government faces rising debt obligations in 2009 and prices for its top export earner -- soy -- have slumped .
Official numbers put inflation at about 9 percent , but private estimates say it is above 25 percent .
The administration of President Cristina Fernandez also has come under criticism by economists for selling debt to Venezuela at yields above 15 percent , adding to concerns .
“ Why does a country that has trade and fiscal surpluses , is growing at Chinese rates and its principal export product ( soy ) is worth double what it was 10 years ago , have to go to Chavez to get into debt at 15 percent ?
There ’s no doubt .
We ’re in trouble , ” economist Carlos Melconian told newspaper Clarin .
Argentina confirmed in its official gazette on Friday the recent sale of 2015 dollar - denominated Bodens ARRO15D=RRBB to Venezuela , saying the government of President Hugo Chavez bought paper with a face value of $ 1.46 billion .
An Economy Ministry source said earlier this week Venezuela paid $ 1 billion for the bonds .
Argentina relies heavily on Venezuela for buying its debt because it remains largely shut out of international capital markets following its historic debt default in 2002 .
The country completed a giant debt restructuring of $ 100 billion in defaulted bonds in 2005 , but holders of about a quarter of that did not accept its swap offer and have sued Argentina in European and U.S. courts .
GLASS HALF - EMPTY ?
The latest debt sale to Venezuela raised concern about Argentina ’s ability to meet its financing needs next year .
Buenos Aires needs $ 6.1 billion in financing this year , according to the Economy Ministry .
Next year -- a mid-term election year -- financing needs jump to $ 11.8 billion .
The ministry said late on Friday in a statement that the government had already covered its financing needs for this year and the primary budget surplus was on target to reach 3.5 percent of gross domestic product by the year ’s end .
It also said economic growth , as measured by the EMAE economic activity index , was more than 6 percent in June year - on - year and more than 7 percent in July .
The June EMAE figure will be released officially on Friday , Aug. 15 .
Argentina ’s primary budget surplus totaled 20.31 billion pesos in the first half of the year , but some critics say the national government is maintaining the surplus by freezing funds for the provinces .
Rumors of a possible downgrade in Argentina ’s sovereign rating also helped depress bond prices .
“ Amid speculation of an imminent rating downgrade there also were concerns about the negative impact of the recent pull back in agricultural commodity prices on the fiscal accounts and overall performance of the real economy , ” Alberto Ramos of Goldman Sachs said in a research note .
On the local debt market , Argentine bonds < AR / BONOS > closed nearly 3 percent lower on average in over - the - counter trade .
The jitters also hit the peso ARSB= and stocks .
MERV .
Meanwhile , Argentina ’s five - year credit default swaps , which protect investors against such things as defaults or credit restructurings , surged higher on Friday .
The cost to insure $ 10 million worth of Argentine debt rose by 69 basis points to roughly 885 basis points , according to the latest CDS prices from data provider Markit .
That means investors are spending $ 885,000 annually over five years to insure their bonds , a rise of $ 69,000 in the last 24 hours .

Last night , a mob of dangerously dancing hipsters armed with boom boxes and dressed as terrifying pandas marched from Union Square to Williamsburg , where the NYPD met them in force .
Apparently , dancing and loud music on a hot August evening can lead to any end of mischief , so our boys and girls in blue twisted arms , threw people down , and destroyed at least one portable stereo .
Reports one eyewitness : " The last straw for the police was when a really good song came on a boom box that this guy was holding on his shoulder a few feet away from me .
The cops must have known that something sinister was taking place because there were at least 10 people dancing to the music .
Then a cop grabbed the guy with the boom box by the back of his arm and yanked him into the street , pushing him to the ground and making him loose grip of the stereo .
Now , I know that dancing is illegal and also a sin , but I think there was excessive force used in this situation .
The stereo fell , batteries flying everywhere , and when a few of his friends picked it up , a woman cop angrily lunged for the boom box and tried to further dismantle it ! "
" The U.S. financial system is in a mess .
The global marketplace is in the same disarray ...
What the hell is going on ?
Can we get out of this mess , and how ?
And will our children be living in caves ? "
New Yorker staff writer Nick Paumgarten posed those distressingly pertinent questions to Michael Novogratz , president of the Fortress Investment Group and the 317th - richest person in America , yesterday at the New Yorker Stories From the Near Future conference .
Much to the relief of everybody who does n't want to spend their retirement fending off water bandits , Novogratz was optimistic .
Our current economic woes , he said , are analogous to the dot - com bubble burst .
The internet 's turn - of - the - millennium troubles were solved by the rise of second - generation web services .
Globalization 1.0 , as Novogratz called it , stalled after an initial purchasing power burst among the developing world 's newly - arrived middle classes , but will be saved by globalization 2.0 .
All will be well .
There 's only one catch :
We need another wealth - generating economic bubble .
And that , said Novogratz , must come – can only come – from new energy sources and green technology .
" As the price of oil goes up , there 's got to be a green revolution .
I think of what will be the next driver of the American economy , and it 's green energy .
That 's a huge growth opportunity .
It 's not about the pollution .
It 's about the energy .
Gas will go to $ 10 a gallon , " he said .
I tracked Novogratz down after his speech .
He was surrounded by a cluster of $ 2,000 - a- head conference attendees wondering what will happen to the U.S. dollar and what to invest in .
( The answer to their first concern was over my head – but as for the latter , Novogratz is excited about the Brazilian economy . )
Curious about his distinction between economic self - interest and the effects of pollution , I asked for his take on the economic impacts of climate change .
He seemed quite sanguine .
It 's a wild card , he said , but probably wo n't have an impact within the next ten years .
" In 30 , 40 , 50 years , maybe you get an event that scares people .
But unless you get an out - of - the - box event that you can tie into climate change , " he continued , it was n't going to be an economic factor .
Now , there 's a reason why Novogratz is a full - blown member of the plutocracy and I 'm a science journalist – but that said , this seemed a bit cavalier to me .
He 's betting that worst - case scenarios wo n't come true , and even the short - term possibilities are scary .
The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in their last report
[.pdf ] that even small increases in global temperature could cause water shortages for hundreds of millions of people , crop - threatening droughts , increased flood and storm damage , localized " negative impacts " on subsistence farmers and fishers , and potentially troubling disease shifts .
( Or , to think of it another way , the current food crisis is taking place without an actual food shortage .
Add a season of widespread droughts or floods to the mix , and things get bad .
Quickly . )
That 's just the short term .
The long - term is much scarier – and part of the reason why wealthy people are so wealthy is the ability to think several decades into the future .
Seeing green technology in terms of maximizing profits rather than reducing greenhouse gas pollution creates a false dichotomy : pollution and profits are intertwined – if not now , then certainly in the future .
And the future may arrive sooner than expected .
Note : " The politicians ' response should be , ' Get used to it , ' " said
Novogratz of the emerging energy crisis now fuelled by rising oil costs .
He was particularly scathing of Hillary Clinton 's gas tax holiday , which he called " the stupidest idea I ever heard . "
Note # 2 : For more in this vein , read Alexis Madrigal 's interview with angel investor Eric Janszen **.
Janszen also believes that only greentech can save the U.S. economy .

at first all i wanted was to see what precinct 125 reported but i ran across impossible numbers
sarosta has 241,870 registered voters and according to sos 127,180 showed for the presidential preference race on the 29th
BUT when u look at the pres results the sos shows 1,749,920 votes for dem candidates and 1,949,498 votes for rep candidates ... dats 3,699,418 votes
looking at the constitutional amendment their were 2,667,543 yes votes and 1,497,970 no votes , , , dats 4,165,513 votes .... roughly 32 times as many votes as they had peops turn out ?

Karen~ !Holy
Wha ...?
I will look into your figures immediately .
Sending your info to our Sarasota number cruncher and see what we 've got , here .
Would n't surprise me one bit if the trend we see in New Hampshire , New Jersey and other states throughout this freaky , funky primary season re : more votes than voters , is also reflected by these Sarasota statistics .
Thank you , ever so !
Brad , I 'm just over the moon today to find this video posted here at my erstwhile cyber - home , BRADBLOG .
This video has been haunting me above all others , as the complete lack of observation in Sarasota , Florida ( of all places ! ) was so far beyond my comprehension that it put me under my own couch for several days ... indisposed .
Thank you for giving this one some oxygen .
You have much assuaged my elephant - teary , broken - hearted trek home from DENT 's Board of Elections office ...

... Phil said on 6/4/2008 @ 9:03 am PT ...
What I get from this video is that , sure there 's plenty of bad things caught on tape , but there needs to be a " sting " to the activity .
Let me explain .
We 've all watched the TV show called " COPS " now ask yourself , when the cops got you on ( DV / HDV ) tape with your hand in the cookie jar , do they sit around and just film more crap , or do they start locking the ( not yet found guilty ) perps up and put a stop to the nonsense ?
They use law , and put a stop to the nonsense .
Poll watchers do n't seem to have leadership authority or any other authority to nullify bad actions .
Which leads me to further think , okay , fine , you caught it on tape , and that 's a skill - set for sure to be able to even hold the camera still long enough to catch the perps .
But the camera operator is n't going to be able to do anything until after editing , and by then the totals are announced on the fascist alphabet channels ( in this case it sounded like it was by way of a mobile phone .
but hey I just watched it once I could be wrong . )
The problem here is that the numbers are being delivered without a challenge at the moment in time it happens .
A lot of secretary of states ' will let you watch if you do n't interfere .
But without interference the crime is committed again and again , that crime is election fraud .
( Not to be confused with voter fraud )
So how are " We The People " going to assert absolute power over " existing perps with authority "
It can't be done with electronics .
The nature of the beast is you can't see it .
And if by some chance you do see an equipment failure you can't do squat about it .
We need something inserted here .
I am tired of fighting this same argument .
The machines need to go , the poll watchers need access to paper ballots , and to be educated the importance of keeping on top of things and the critical importance of what they do , no stuffing their friggin mouths with fried chicken or " little debbie " donut snacks .
30 feet away is n't acceptable .
If the office is too small then hold the damn election out doors in the sunlight .
I would love to fire up my cameras and catch someone , but I would n't be able to contain myself , and I would end up either beat up or beating someone up .
I can't contain myself to the knowledge that the election is going south because of failures and rigging and not want to smash my camera into the side of their head .
The reason is that if I stay silent , and inactive , and forfeit my " JUST DO IT " card ; then the wrong people get put in power and the whole nastiness repeats itself .
It 's pointless to even watch , when you can't see the signal of a modem , the modem has failed , and some freaking perp is hacking out new numbers to keep the ball rolling , while the jets are taking off to swear the criminals in . / or the candidate that really mattered is being slandered , spun , lied about , propagandized across the audio / video fascist media spectrum .
THis is all about an abusive use of electronics .
If there is no constitutional right to vote then fine , keep on doing this crap .
If there is , then it 's time to declare war on these organized criminals .
I do n't know what else to say , I suck at trying to make my point proper .

Hello , my Phil ! ~
You make excellent points , and I share your heartfelt , impassioned response 100 % .
One of the most frustrating questions I am asked is , " Okay , so you caught 'em cheating ... now what ? "
I have struggled to come up with a decent answer to that one without sounding cheeky , ill - informed , and Polyanna - glib ; without honking on mightily about " the power of one " in the face of such overwhelming odds .
Lord knows there is no place to take the evidence with absolutely no oversight , the DOJ in the pocket of the bad guys , AG 's asleep at the wheel , our courts and the honorable (? ) justices all on the take ( although that varies from state to state . )
Florida , it seems to most of us , is a total wash .
It 's corrupt from the top down ( thanks to Jebby ) as I learned following the two recounts , the 3 so - called " independent audits " , the 4 court cases that resulted in the botched Jennings / Buchanan race , and the subsequent whitewashed GAO investigation that exonerated the iVotronics in which the STATE once again dictated the terms of the testing ( even hand - picked which machines would be tested , the location , and the conditions in which the FEDERAL INVESTIGATION could apply it 's resources . )
Most disturbing , of course , and I do n't have to tell you any of this , but just for the record -- to have Congress roll over and reject Christine Jennings ' and Clint Curtis ' contested elections when there was ample proof of incompetence ( at best ) and malfeasance ( at most probable worst ) was a blow to our efforts that I would not have believed could occur even if you had a crystal ball and shown me all the details well in advance ...
That all said : I do have hope , Phil , and as misplaced as it might be , it relies on waves of LOCAL CITIZEN PARTICIPATION / OVERSIGHT on Election Night .
This is getting harder and harder to do in Florida thanks to KATHY DENT and KURT BROWNING 's efforts to bar our most experienced election experts from observation , but I tell you : I have seen over and over again how just the simple act of showing up can improve the process .
We need vast armies of citizen observers / videographers / statisticians / Election Law and computer experts -- not just me or you alone with our silly , solo cam - corders .
My hope is , and I 'm seeing it manifest Phil , is change from the bottom up , not the top down .
Ron Paul folks are running for local offices .
Obama supporters are signing up to be poll workers .
My fellow BRADBLOGGERS and other wonderful activists have succeeded in planting the seeds of doubt , and now ( slowly ) folks are figuring out exactly what they can do .
It DOES sound a bit Polyanna , but the power in numbers theory really does work !
Ask Kathy Dent , who now refers to me as " the youtube lady " and whose national reputation is on the skids -- thanks to BRADBLOG , BEV HARRIS , SUSAN PYNHON and my silly little videos that have captured their efforts for the public record .
My hope is that videos like this , given enough circulation , will empower the many citizens who feel helpless and outmaneuvered to just .
show .
up .
And demand accountability .
Demand transparency .
Learn the flaws in their voting system firsthand .
Grill their S.O.E's .
Lobby their Canvassing Boards and local congresspeople to wake the hell up before they spend more of our tax dollars on these easy - to - manipulate , pre-rigged , election systems .
Insist that our designated party observers OBSERVE the process on our behalf , as they were chosen to do , instead of feeding their fat faces and giggling together like they 're at an effin ' High School PROM .
And if that does n't work , Phil - - I , for one , am willing to trek down to my local CRAP newspaper , the SARASOTA HERALD TRIBUNE , with torches ( metaphoric ) and fisticuffs ( not - so - metaphoric ) and create a ruckus that no one can ignore .
Ca n't do that by myself ... none of us can .
Thank you so much for watching , Phil , and for your insights -- they are never lost on me .

If you want to see just how frightened they are of us , Phil , here 's a Kathy Dent classic provided to us by GINNY ROSS of the Oregon Voter 's Rights coalition , who infiltrated the creepiest of all creepy conferences of vendors and vendor - friendly S.O.E 's last year : KATHY DENT : " Those Pesky Activists "
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83TGawMwJhQ
Brad has posted parts of this whopper video in the past , but I think this clip includes some of the rest of her verbal garbage that was n't seen before ...
JUNE 27 , 2007 : KATHY DENT blames all of her woes on activists in this 3 min. clip from her presentation at the NW Pacific Election Conference .
Dent manages fewer lies than usual in this clip , but her tone and her actions reveal exactly how she feels about the Sarasota Alliance for Fair Elections and their paper ballot charter amendment of 2006 .
The amendment , which called for paper ballots and random audits , passed by a wide margin -- but is currently being challenged by DENT and Secretary of State , Kurt Browning ( on the tax - payers dime , I might add .
Disgusting . )
Dent also takes time to warn her audience about Bev Harris ' Citizen tool - kit from Black Box Voting ; even quotes Bev Harris and Brad Friedman with the phrase " Be the Media " , complaining about " the media " ( which is Leonard Schmiege , Ginny Ross and myself ) as the cause her growing YOUTUBE infamy ...
Another ( small ) victory for activists , as we can see how our efforts are making corrupt election official sweat it out .
Let 's hope for an indictment and SOON .
More to come from this creepy conference as I process all the lies .
So many I hardly know where to begin .

Thanks Jeannie for the great video .
Please keep up this essential work as much as you are able .
I was just thinking about the question of why the modems would fail to upload results to the main tabulator .
Maybe there is some coding in the software put in that would do a checksum prior to the upload to verify that the totals on the memory card and the actual total of scanned ballots by the machine were essentially equal within the accepted standard deviation .
If they were not equal , then the instruction would be not to upload .
Maybe Diebold overlooked this inadvertently or intentionally left it in to allow this backdoor changing of results .
If I really wanted to be conspiratorial , the exact machine would be flagged to indicate that it would not upload .
Does anyone have any knowledge or reason to believe that this is or is not a relevant theory ?

i think u have hit nail on the head , but the question then is .... if the machine is SUPPOSE to give an accurate count how can the votes match 100 % reporting BEFORE 100 % of precincts r in ?
its not poss ... and it also explains y when the numbers were manually entered in we get more votes than voters in the yes / no contest phil ... jeanie is trying to educate americans with her videos
i am trying to educate americans that their sos r reporting impossible numbers
as far as what to do when we find these things ... we r doing what we can by informing the only media ( that might follow thru on these finds )

Phil , Jeannie , this is what annoyed me about Scott Maclellan saying the " liberal " media was lax in reporting the facts about the war and so on ...
How can you get the word out on the wrong doings of this administration if the media is owned by the criminals !
In a " normal " world , news agencies would be fighting to be the first headlining these " mistakes " .
It 's what bigdan has shouted about for four years , at least , and he is right .
I mean look at last night ... the USA made history with the first black nominee and all I could find on TV was one " Canadian " station talking about this historic event .

Steve B writes : " I was just thinking about the question of why the modems would fail to upload results to the main tabulator ... " GREAT question !
I have wondered the same thing , and as Karen points out , your theory sure would explain some statistical wonk !
I 'm gonna ask around about that tomorrow , will post what I find out , here .
Meantime , I can tell you that when KATHY DENT was asked to explain away how 13 precincts were unable to upload due to a " modem line " failure ( featured in previous video " DIEBOLD OVERRIDE / pt2 : Withholding Precinct Results " :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRFtYGJtOEQ)
she said : " I understand from other election supervisors who use this system that this ( is normal ) ... and to have an 80 % successful modem upload rate is good ... so we 're up there pretty high . "
WHA ...?
Could that be true ?
( If it is , it may be the first time she opened her yap to NOT LIE about something . )
However , it is also worth noting that she has been quick to condemn this DIEBOLD " paper " system as she fought it 's implementaion - - tooth and nail -- all the way to the Florida Supreme Court , claiming the Sarasota for Fair Alliance 's paper ballot referendum was unconstitutional .
She also confirms that it's the same " 10 or 11 precincts " they had trouble uploading in the last election on this Diebold system .
When we asked her which precincts were problematic -- whattaya know !-- NORTHPORT !
( NORTHPORT had one of the most significant undervote rates from the ES&S iVotronics back in 2006 - - a " precinct of interest " , home to the only pocket of minority and working class voters in Sarasota . )
She also mentions precinct 99 , which I understand includes a trailer park community ...???
Another was precinct 125 , Colonial Park , where the machines were down on election day between 7:00 and 9:15 am .
What are the odds that TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS would have trouble processing THE SAME EXACT PRECINCTS ?
It could be just as simple as a cheap , crappy voting system forged by criminals , implemented by dubious officials and utilized by an election staff that does n't know how to navigate it 's flaws ... but that 's an awfully convenient series of hoo - haws .

Still trying to get to the bottom of your amazing numerical find ( one of your many ) .
Hoping to hear something soon .
In response to your question :
" Do votes for congressional district 13 come from somewhere besides Sarosota County ? "
Yes , district 13 is made up of FOUR and a HALF counties .
MANATEE / HARDEE / CHARLOTTE / SARASOTA and I think half of DESOTO .
Might be all of DESOTO and half of CHARLOTTE .

Oh !

Too true .
But a recent headline took note that the major networks are experiencing unprecedented slumping numbers .
Meanwhile , CNN , NBC -- hell , even FEUX have all been busy reporting what the blogs have to say ( although hardly ever THIS one , I have noticed with much angst on a shoe - string ... )
But there 's a new website called BREAK THE MATRIX that I 'm uber - juiced about !
http://www.breakthematrix.com/
It 's like a cross between YOUTUBE and OPED NEWS / citizen journalists can upload articles AND video , subscribe to one another , comment in open threads and forums !
It even has it's own programming available , and everyone who joins ( taking off very quickly ) is asked to consider switching cable providers if need be with the hopes this network will soon be picked up on pay channels and radio .
I plan on living over at BTM like I do here at BRADBLOG .

I do n't know if I agree with your speculation Steve .
That 's not saying that your speculation is bad or good .
I used to run a bbs that had a modem , and the only way someone could n't logon is if my line number was busy .
( I did n't have the more expensive roll over numbers )
There are a LOT of modem protocols .
X , Y , Z , and variants .
for example dsz ( a 61 k byte program ) ( e.g. SMALL )
DSZ Copyright 06-26-90 by Omen Technology INC ,
·courtesy of My Elite Skill0rs·
Usage :
dsz [ CON ] [ port 1..18 ] [ speed N ] [ D ] [ d ] [ handshake arg ] command
So say I know the number 555 - 1212 I could just
dsz port 1 speed 57600 d t
OK
ATDT5551212
CONNECT 57600 Start doing business .
What I do know about modems and that type of communication is that there were flaws in all the software ( ALL OF IT , ALL OF IT IS BUGGY , EVEN I FOUND HELLA ROOT LEVEL EXPLOITS BACK THEN ) and there were problems with basic operations , all in all it's a great method ( like in say FidoNet ) to communicate within a small or even rather larget ( like FidoNet ) network .
It was a RISK worth taking , and a technology that was not being used to abuse our constitutional republic .
It was self policed , but even so , there were things that sometimes could not be explained .
So if you were to ask me if I thought it was safe to count our nation 's election votes across such a system , or similar system or just private line to line , I would undoubtedly tell you hell no .
How many sysops out there had corrupted message database from importing a rogue FTS - 01 packet ?
Or a totally botched QWKMail upload packet .
( either by stupid high ascii / ansi or specially crafted to attempt to lock up the BBS node )
Most all of these fascist news anchor types on your alphabet channels have no clue about this stuff , how it works , how to set it up .
They are just parrots .
I digress ..
Then there were the lesser talked about programs ..
Anyone remember Norton Lambert 's Close - Up ?
With that you had complete root to the box .
Flash forward to today 's world , as I see it , there is really only one problem with the use of electronics in our elections .
That is that it is invisible to the human eye .
For this one reason alone it should be outlawed .
So when something " screw 's the pooch " be it bad programming or malicious activity we have no way to see it .
In essence we have to become forensic experts to TRY to find out , and there 's no guarantee we can find it .
Add to that we now have the telco's in bed with FIOS " Y " taps ( are they two way ? ) , miles and miles of wire that can be attacked in between at any point ( talk about chain of custody there 's a dilema , who can watch all the wire 's , vaults , repeaters , hub 's , power suppy , etc . )
And finally add to that possibility of electronic parts ( HARDWARE ) themselves potentially specially crafted with hidden , malicious , footprint removing , logic changing circuitry built in at the doping and manufacture level .
Do n't belive me ?
Ask the USAF if they do n't consider this a REALLY BIG PROBLEM RIGHT NOW , that say an electronic chip they used for parts has a backdoor in it .
They have TEAMS working on it right now .
All of this electronic nonsense , added by HAVA or other reasons , just adds a level of complexity to voting in an election that should n't have been there in the first place .
It 's an abusive use of technology .
I can clean and delete the rogue FTS - 001 packet , but you can't do that to people 's votes in an election .
Let alone , you can't SEE anything with your eye to provide oversight even if you were allowed access .
What are you going to do , open the cover and watch the chips and blinking lights ?!
I know I am just repeating this stuff over .
Maybe we truly have just lost control of our country .
The one thing I do know for sure is that EVERYONE that pushes electronics for tabulating votes is corrupt .
That 's a fact !
They 've been told over and over and over , and so when they say , hey maybe we can do this , it 's not just a new idea , it 's corruption .
None of the ideas work , the only thing that works is cutting the damned power cables off everything , no batteries , no chips , no modems , no phones , no radios .
And then using a paper ballot , enforcing a bloody serious chain of custody , and citizen oversight , MANDITORY use of voters ( like in Jury Duty ) if need be .
e.g .
You want the right to vote , you want to be a registered voter , you better be willing to help count the vote .
Other than that , I dunno any more .
This administration has corrupted so many things I can no longer keep up .

LONDON , June 6 ( UPI ) -- U.S. folk - rock icon Bob Dylan has endorsed Barack Obama for president , saying Obama is " redefining what a politician is , " The Times of London reported .
Dylan -- whose song " The Times They Are a - Changin ' " helped define political protest in the '60s -- said the Illinois senator is " redefining the nature of politics from the ground up . "

Dylan made the comments in an interview in Denmark , during a tour of Scandinavia , the newspaper said .
" Well , you know right now America is in a state of upheaval .
Poverty is demoralizing .
You can't expect people to have the virtue of purity when they are poor , " Dylan said .
" But we 've got this guy out there now who is redefining the nature of politics from the ground up ... Barack Obama .
" He 's redefining what a politician is , so we 'll have to see how things play out , " Dylan said .
The 67 - year - old Dylan said he was " hopeful that things might change .
Some things are going to have to . "
Obama Tuesday secured enough delegates to the Democratic nominating convention to assure he will be the party 's presidential nominee in the general election .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Mikhail Glikberg remembers when he made a decent living as a taxi driver in Boston .
He could work a 12 - hour shift and take home up to $ 80 a day after expenses .
That was a few years ago .
Now , with gas above $ 4 a gallon , he pays up to $ 60 a day at the pump instead of $ 15 .
He 's lucky if he clears $ 20 .
" Sometimes I ask myself at night when I do n't make anything , " Why do I do it ? " said Glikberg , 51 , who has cruised the Boston streets for 17 years .
" Whatever I make , I spend on gas . "
While all drivers are reeling from soaring fuel prices , cabbies are feeling the crunch more than most .
They spend an average of $ 14,400 a year on gas , up 42 % over the past two years , according to the Taxicab , Limousine & Paratransit Association , a Rockville , Md. - based trade group .
But unlike those in other industries , cabbies can't just raise rates to cushion themselves against the price spike .
In most places , taxi fares are regulated by the local government , leading drivers to petition officials for help .
The latest drive came Monday , when New York City cabbies asked for a $ 1 fuel surcharge .
Drivers are doing what they can to reduce their expenses and make more money .
Some are working longer hours or more days .
Others are trolling for rides less or spending more time at the airport , where they can shut off their engines .
A few are turning in their car keys and looking for other jobs .
" Some drivers are literally deciding whether to buy a tank of gas or buy food , " said Donna Blythe - Shaw , staff representative for United Steelworkers , which represents the Boston Taxi Drivers Association , which is asking for a fare hike .
Raising rates
At least 34 communities , including Las Vegas and Philadelphia , have raised rates over the past two years , according to the trade group .
Another 11 - Miami and Chicago , among them - have approved temporary fuel surcharges ranging from 50 cents to $ 2.50 per trip .
Other places , such as Boston and Milwaukee , are considering giving a boost to cabbies ' bottom lines .
" Because most cities are in the process of adjusting the rates , drivers are holding on , " said Alfred LaGasse , the group 's chief executive office .
" But some communities are awfully slow to respond . "
Boston cab drivers , who have n't seen meter rates change in six years , want fares to go up to 45 cents per one - eighth mile , an increase of 15 cents , and the starting rate to rise to $ 2.75 , a 50 - cent jump .
This would hike the cost of a 4 - mile ride by about $ 5 , Blythe - Shaw said .
The Boston Police Department , which regulates rates , should decide whether to approve the proposal in coming weeks .
The New York Taxi Workers Alliance , meanwhile , Monday asked the city for a fuel surcharge of $ 1 when gas costs more than $ 3.50 a gallon and $ 1.50 if it goes above $ 5 a gallon , said Bhairavi Desai , the group 's executive director .
Cabbies now are paying up to $ 1,200 more a month for fuel , which is coming out of their pocket , she noted .
The city 's Taxi & Limousine Commission , however , said that current circumstances do not warrant a surcharge , noting the drivers have received two fare increases since 2004 .
Government officials say the surcharges and rate hikes generally have not met much opposition from the public .
They said they favor surcharges pegged to the price of gas because they are easy to implement , temporary and can be re-evaluated .
That 's why Miami , for instance , recently revamped its laws to implement a fuel surcharge , said Cathy Peel , director of Miami - Dade County 's Consumer Service Department .
Balancing interests of passengers
However , officials said they have to keep in mind the interests of passengers and the tourism industry .
Higher fares could have a ripple effect .
And , they could even backfire on cabbies if a rate hike prompts more people to walk or take public transit .
" At some point you have to ask what 's going to stop people from taking a cab , " said Norma Reyes , commissioner of Chicago 's Department of Consumer Services , which oversees rates .
" Will a fare increase reduce the income a driver is making because less people will take cabs ? "
Even the fuel surcharge is n't helping , some say .
But many cabbies have little choice but to bear it and find a way to make ends meet , said Diego Feliciano , president of the South Florida Taxicab Association .
Often , cabbies are immigrants with little experience beyond driving , he said .
This makes it hard for them to find other jobs , particularly in a weak economy .
Take Henry Gomez , who has driven a cab in Chicago for 12 years .
He said he finds passengers take the surcharge out of his tip .
So he has to drive more , cruising up to 14 hours a day instead of 12 .
Moreover , he 's lost his weekends .
Gomez used to work a half day on Saturday and take Sunday off .
Now he works a full shift on Saturday and a half day on Sunday .
" I have to work more hours to make less money , but I do n't have a choice , " said Gomez , adding that another line of work is n't an option for him .
" If they keep raising prices , I do n't know what I 'm going to do .
But with this economy , where are you going to find a job ? "
Abrams : Did McCain spokesman mock candidate on national TV ?
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday July 30 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican presidential candidate John McCain shook up his conservative supporters on Sunday when he suggested that he might be prepared to raise Social Security taxes .
By Tuesday , McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds had gone on Fox News to perform damage control , insisting repeatedly , " There is no imaginable circumstance where John McCain would raise payroll taxes .
It s absolutely out of the question .
...
There 's no imaginable circumstance where he would raise taxes . "
MSNBC's Dan Abrams asked his guests , " Did I miss something there ?
Or did John McCain just say it is on the table and then his campaign spokesperson almost mocked it , as if , ' Oh , do n't listen to that guy .
Come on .
He does n't represent the campaign . ' "
Republican strategist Andrea Tantaros suggested that she thought Bounds ' actions were appropriate .
" I 'm a diehard fiscal conservative , " she stated , " so this does n't send a tingle up my leg .
It actually sends a chill down my spine .
...
If they do n't keep hammering home that he will not raise taxes , this will be a loss .
But for now , I think they tried to put a band - aid on it . "
" It 's shocking ... after 25 years of running for office , of being in office , that he 's running such a miserable campaign , " countered Roy Sekoff of the Huffington Post .
" He could not give an answer instead of melting down . "
" I think that McCain is actually a practical guy , " Abrams suggested .
" And he does not want to box himself into saying , ' No way , no how , no new taxes . '
I think he just wants a little leeway . "
" He may be practical , " responded Democratic analyst Tanya Acker , " but a straight talker he is not . "
She suggested it was time to be " done with this myth of the straight - talking maverick who says one thing and holds fast to it for 35 years .
That 's just not true . "
" He 's gotten in the habit of even denying that he said something the day after , " Sekoff agreed .

This confocal microscope image of a blood - brain barrier model shows quantum rods bioconjugated with transferrin ; the findings could lead to better treatment of neuronal disorders .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A unique nanoparticle system developed by University at Buffalo scientists takes advantage of the versatility of bioconjugated quantum rods to ferry novel diagnostic and therapeutic agents across the blood - brain barrier , according to recent in vitro findings .
Described in a paper published in Bioconjugate Chemistry , the system uses the rod-shaped semiconductor nanoparticles that are bioconjugated , or coupled , with biomolecules capable of crossing the blood - brain barrier .
The blood - brain barrier acts as a physiological " checkpoint " that selectively allows certain molecules in blood circulation to enter the brain .
While it naturally evolved in order to protect the brain from invasion of various circulating toxins and other harmful molecules , the blood - brain barrier also serves as a major impediment to the brain - specific delivery of various diagnostic / therapeutic molecules needed for combating various neuronal disorders .
The quantum rod system the UB researchers developed has the potential to simultaneously and non-invasively deliver diagnostic and therapeutic agents targeted to a wide variety of neurological diseases as well as obesity and drug addiction , according to Paras N. Prasad , Ph.D. , executive director of the UB Institute for Lasers , Photonics and Biophotonics and SUNY Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemistry , who led the UB team .
" These brain - specific nanoparticle systems represent a significant improvement over commonly used , highly - invasive methods of delivering active molecules into the brain , most of which rely on direct injection , " he said .
The UB team , together with colleagues from Buffalo General Hospital , has developed a simple method for linking quantum rods to the iron - transporting protein , transferrin and other biomolecules , which routinely pass through the blood - brain barrier .
" Our findings unfold a new dimension in blood - brain barrier transport using inorganic nanoparticles , which are structurally robust and demonstrate the potential to transport multiple agents across this physiological barrier , " said Indrajit Roy , Ph.D. , deputy director for biophotonics at the UB institute .
" This system allows the nanoparticles and the multiple therapeutic and imaging agents they carry to ' sneak ' safely across the barrier and into the brain .
It 's a Trojan horse approach . "
The functionalized quantum rods proved to have very low toxicity , according to Ken - Tye Yong , Ph.D. , postdoctoral research associate in the UB institute , providing additional evidence that when linked to drug molecules , they could make very suitable treatment probes for diseases of the brain .
The new nanoparticle platform could provide scientists with a kind of window on the blood - brain barrier , enhancing what they know about it and allowing them to view non-invasively in real - time how imaging and therapeutic agents affect the brain .
The quantum rod system also serves as the basis of a blood - brain barrier - crossing test kit the UB researchers are developing .
The test kit would enable scientists to competitively evaluate which molecules would most efficiently transport diagnostic and therapeutic agents across the blood - brain barrier by exploiting the ability of quantum rods to emit light in different colors , depending on their size .
In addition to Prasad , Roy and Yong , co-authors included Gaixia Xu , Ph.D. , former postdoctoral associate , and Hong Ding , Ph.D. , postdoctoral associate , both of the UB Institute for Lasers , Photonics and Biophotonics ; Supriya D. Mahajan , Ph.D. , research assistant professor in the Department of Medicine in the UB School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences and at Buffalo General Hospital , and Stanley A. Schwartz , M.D. , Ph.D. , UB professor of Medicine , Pediatrics and Microbiology and director of the Division of Allergy , Immunology and Rheumatology in the Department of Medicine at Buffalo General Hospital .

I now cringe when I see a health insurance statement .
This was not always the case .
Each time I receive my insurance statements they say something to the extent of :
Your doctor charged $ 400 and your insurance company only allows $ 200 .
This is not a bill .
I used to flinch when I ’d receive these until I finally called up someone and found out that the statement was not indeed a bill .
Somehow or another I never ended up having to pay any more to my doctor unless you count a random $ 20 here or there .
And then this changed .
My family has a strong history of cancer and being in my early 30’s I hit the point where some preventative testing was needed .
So , being 10 years younger than my dad was when he was diagnosed with cancer , I scheduled myself for a routine , in - patient exploration .
With my $ 100 co-pay , this was n’t a big deal .
Well , luckily for me , they did n’t find anything malignant but they did have to send in some samples for testing .
And along with this came my whooping bill for $ 400 ( give or take a few dollars ) .
Now , I know that many people would scoff at a mere $ 400 but to us , that ’s a chunk of change … especially when we did n’t see it coming .
A small part of me wonders if I should have waited … just not had the test done right now .
Apparently I ’m not alone .
A recent article in BMJ , Underinsurance threatens physical and financial wellbeing of US families , discusses this very problem .
According to the authors , people are struggling with healthcare costs mainly in the form of higher deductibles that are being passed on from companies who are themselves having a difficult time with the increasing costs of healthcare .
( Yes , this may explain my $ 400 bill : my personal deductible towards my test .
Strangely enough though I do n’t feel any better about handing over the money . )
And the individual and collaborative results of this widespread financial burden is pronounced .
Bankruptcy is one problem , albeit a big one .
But there are other results of increasing health care that from a short - term perspective may not seem alarming .
Issues such as individuals refusing to get suggested tests performed or decisions to stop taking prescribed medicine for a little while .
And while these do n’t grab your attention like the word BANKRUPTCY may , these other situations are just as dangerous and in some cases more so .
As the article mentions , universal healthcare options are on the board this presidential election year .
This is good .
This is a start .
Because while the costs of practically everything is increasing — gas , food , entertainment — healthcare is not one of those “ luxury ” items that can be done away with .
Or at least it should n’t be .
But increasingly , consciously or unconsciously , medical needs are being regulated to the discretionary section of budget sheets everywhere .

Since I posted on April 28 the article “ Is There an Army Cover Up of the Rape and Murder of Women Soldiers , ” the deaths of two more U.S. Army women in Iraq and Afghanistan have been listed as suicides — the Sept. 28 , 2007 , death of 30 - year - old Spc. Ciara Durkin and the Feb. 22 , 2008 , death of 25 - year - old Spc. Keisha Morgan .
Both “ suicides ” are disputed by the families of the women .
Since April 2008 , five more U.S. military women have died in Iraq — three in noncombat - related incidents .
Ninety - nine U.S. , six British and one Ukrainian military women and 13 U.S. female civilians have been killed in Iraq , Kuwait and Bahrain , as well as probably hundreds of thousands of Iraqi women and girls .
Of the 99 U.S. military women , 64 were in the Army active component , nine in the Army National Guard , seven in the Army Reserve , seven in the Marine Corps , nine in the Navy and three in the Air Force .
According to the Department of Defense , 41 of the 99 U.S. military women who have been killed in Iraq died in “ noncombat - related incidents . ”
Of the 99 U.S. military women killed in the Iraq theater , 41 were women of color ( 21 African - Americans , 16 Latinas , three of Asian - Pacific descent and one Native American — data compiled from the Web site www.nooniefortin.com).
Fourteen U.S. military women , including five in the Army , one in the Army National Guard , two in the Army Reserves , three in the Air Force , two in the Navy ( on ships supporting U.S. forces in Afghanistan ) and one in the Marine Corps , one British military woman and six U.S. civilian women have been killed in Afghanistan .
According to the Department of Defense , four U.S. military women in Afghanistan died in noncombat - related incidents , including one now classified as a suicide .
Four military women of color ( three African - Americans and one Latina ) have been killed in Afghanistan .
( Data compiled from www.nooniefortin.com.)
The deaths of 14 U.S. military ( 13 Army and one Navy ) women and one British military woman who served in Iraq , Kuwait or Afghanistan have been classified as suicides .
Two Army women in Iraq ( Pfc. Hannah Gunterman McKinney , a victim of vehicular homicide , and Pfc. Kamisha Block , who was shot five times by a fellow soldier who then killed himself ) and two Navy women in Bahrain ( MASN Anamarie Camacho and MASN Genesia Gresham , both shot by a male sailor who then shot , but did not kill , himself ) have died at the hands of fellow military personnel .
Several more military women have died with unexplained “ noncombat ” gunshot wounds ( U.S. Army Sgt. Melissa Valles , July 9 , 2003 : gunshot to the abdomen ; Marine Lance Cpl. Juana Arellano , April 8 , 2006 : gunshot wound to the head while in a “ defensive position ” ) .
Most of the deaths of women who have died of noncombat gunshot wounds have been classified as suicides , rather than homicides .
The Army , the only military service to release annual figures on suicides , reported that 115 soldiers committed suicide in 2007 .
According to Army figures , 32 soldiers committed suicide in Iraq and four in Afghanistan .
Of the 115 Army suicides , 93 were in the Regular Army and 22 were in the Army National Guard or Reserves .
The report lists five Army women as having committed suicide in 2007 .
Young , white , unmarried junior enlisted troops were the most likely to commit suicide , according to the report ( Pauline Jelinek , “ Soldier suicides hit highest rate , 115 last year , ” Associated Press , May 29 , 2008 , abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=4955043 ) .
From 2003 until August 2008 , the deaths of 13 Army women and one Navy woman in Iraq and Afghanistan ( including Kuwait and Bahrain ) have been classified as suicides ( numbers confirmed with various media sources ) :
2008 — Spc. Keisha Morgan ( Taji , Iraq )
2007 — Spc. Ciara Durkin ( Bagram , Afghanistan ) , Capt. ( medical doctor ) Roselle Hoffmaster ( Kirkik , Iraq )
2006 — Pfc. Tina Priest ( Taji , Iraq ) , Pfc. Amy Duerkson ( Taji , Iraq ) , Sgt. Denise Lannaman ( Kuwait ) , Sgt. Jeannette Dunn ( Taji , Iraq ) , Maj. Gloria Davis ( Baghdad ) .
2005 — Pvt. Lavena Johnson ( Balad , Iraq ) , 1st Lt. Debra Banaszak ( Kuwait ) , USN MA1 Jennifer Valdivia ( Bahrain )
2004 — Sgt. Gina Sparks ( it is unclear where in Iraq she was injured , but she died in the Fort Polk , La. , hospital )
2003 — Spc. Alyssa Peterson ( Tal Afar , Iraq ) , Sgt. Melissa Valles ( Balad , Iraq )
The demographics of those Army women who allegedly committed suicide are as intriguing as the circumstances of their deaths :
— Seven of the women , being between the ages of 30 and 47 , were older than the norm ( Davis , 47 ; Lannaman , 46 ; Dunn , 44 ; Banaszak , 35 ; Hoffmaster , 32 ; Sparks , 32 ; and Durkin , 30 ) .
( Most military suicides are in their 20s ) .
— Three were officers : a major ( Davis ) , a captain and medical doctor ( Hoffmaster ) and a first lieutenant ( Banaszak ) .
— Five were noncommissioned officers ( Lannaman , Dunn , Sparks , Valles and Valdivia ) .
— Five were women of color ( Morgan , Davis , Johnson , Lannaman , Valles ) .
— Four were from units based at Fort Hood , Texas , and were found dead at Camp Taji , Iraq ( Dunn , Priest , Duerkson , and Morgan ) .
— Two were found dead at Camp Taji , Iraq , 11 days apart ( Priest and Duerkson ) .
— Two were found dead at Balad , Iraq ( Johnson and Valles ) .
— Two had been raped ( Priest , 11 days prior to her death ; Duerksen , during basic training ) .
— One other was probably raped ( Johnson , the night she died ) .
— Two were lesbians ( Lannaman and Durkin ) .
— Two of the women were allegedly involved in bribes or shakedowns of contractors ( Lannaman and Davis ) .
— Two had children ( Davis and Banaszak ) .
— Three had expressed concerns about improprieties or irregularities in their commands ( Durkin ’s concerns were financial ; Davis had given a seven - page deposition on contracting irregularities in Iraq the day before she died ; Peterson was concerned about methods of interrogation of Iraqi prisoners ) .
— Several had been in touch with their families within days of their deaths and had not expressed feelings of depression ( Morgan , Durkin , Davis , Priest , Johnson ) .
The Death of Lavena Johnson
As discussed in my article “ Is There an Army Cover Up of Rape and Murder of Women Soldiers ? , ” 19 - year - old Army Pvt. Lavena Johnson was found dead on the military base in Balad , Iraq , in July 2005 , and her death was characterized by the Army as suicide from an M - 16 rifle gunshot .
From the day their daughter ’s body was returned to them , the parents , both of whom have had a long association with the Army — the father , a medical doctor , is an Army veteran and worked 25 years as a Department of the Army civilian and the mother , too , worked for the Department of the Army — harbored grave suspicions about the Army ’s investigation into Johnson ’s death and the Army ’s characterization of her death as suicide .
As she had been in charge of a communications facility , Johnson was able to call home daily ; in those calls , she gave no indication of emotional problems or being upset .
In a letter to her parents after her death , Johnson ’s commanding officer , Capt .
David Woods , wrote , “ Lavena was clearly happy and seemed in very good health both physically and emotionally . ”
In viewing his daughter ’s body at the funeral home , Dr. John Johnson was concerned about the bruising on her face .
He was puzzled by the discrepancy in the autopsy report on the location of the gunshot wound .
As an Army veteran and a long - time Army civilian employee who had counseled veterans , he was mystified how the exit wound of an M - 16 shot could be so small .
The hole in Lavena ’s head appeared to be more the size of a pistol shot rather than an M - 16 round .
But the gluing of military uniform white gloves onto Lavena ’s hands , hiding burns on one of her hands , is what deepened Dr. Johnson ’s concerns that the Army ’s investigation into the death of his daughter was flawed .
Over the next two and a half years , Dr. and Mrs. Johnson and their family and friends , through the Freedom of Information Act and congressional offices , relentlessly and meticulously requested documents concerning Lavena ’s death from the Department of the Army .
Gradually , with the Army ’s response to each request for information , another piece of evidence about Johnson ’s death emerged .
The military criminal investigator ’s initial drawing of the death scene revealed that Johnson ’s M16 was found perfectly parallel to her body .
The investigator ’s sketch showed that her body was found inside a burning tent , under a wooden bench with an aerosol can nearby .
A witness , an employee of the defense contractor Kellogg , Brown & Root ( KBR ) , stated that he heard a gunshot and when he went to investigate , he found a KBR tent on fire .
When he looked into the tent , he saw a body .
The official Army investigation did not mention a fire , nor that Johnson ’s body had been pulled from the fire .
KBR Women Employees Raped in Iraq
The fact that Lavena Johnson ’s body was discovered in a KBR tent raises questions .
Many KBR women employees have been raped in Iraq .
One law firm in Houston has 15 clients with sexual assault , sexual harassment or retaliation complaints against Halliburton and its former subsidiary Kellogg , Brown & Root LLC ( KBR ) , as well as against the Cayman Island - based Service Employees International Inc. , a KBR shell company ( Karen Houppert , “ Another KBR Rape Case , ” The Nation , April 3 , 2008 ) .
Two female employees of KBR who were raped while in Iraq have testified before Congress .
On her fourth day in Iraq , July 28 , 2005 , Jamie Leigh Jones was gang - raped by seven fellow KBR employees at Camp Hope in Baghdad .
Jones ’ rape occurred nine days after Lavena Johnson was found dead in a KBR tent at Balad Air Base .
Jones was drugged , raped and beaten , and the injuries she suffered were so severe that she had to have reconstructive surgery on her chest ( “ Democracy Now , ” April 18 , 2008 , “ Two Ex-KBR Employees Say They Were Raped by Co-Workers in Iraq , ” www.democracynow.org/2008/4/8/exclusivein_their_first_joint_interview_two).
Jones reportedly was taken back to the KBR area , where she was placed into an empty shipping container under KBR armed guard for almost 24 hours without food or water or the ability to communicate with anyone .
The military doctor who examined her turned over the “ rape kit ” photographs and statement to KBR .
Jones persuaded a guard to allow her a phone call , which she made to her father .
Her father promptly called their Texas congressional representative , Ted Poe , who then called the State Department in Iraq and demanded her immediate release .
Jones was rescued shortly thereafter and quickly left Iraq .
Congressman
Poe again contacted the State Department and the Department of Justice in an effort to launch an investigation , but both departments ignored the requests and even refused to contact Poe for the next two years .
The “ rape kit ” and the photographs of and statement from Jones taken by a military doctor disappeared ( ABC News , “ KBR Employees : Company Covered Up Sexual Assault and Harassment , ” abcnews.go.com/Blotter/popup?id=3948132&contentIndex=1&start=false&page=1 ) .
Jones testified Dec. 17 , 2007 , before the House Judiciary Committee on “ Enforcement of Federal Criminal Law to Protect Americans Working for U.S. Contractors in Iraq ” ( judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_121907.html ) .
The nonprofit foundation Jones created after her ordeal , the Jamie Leigh Jones Foundation , has been contacted by 40 U.S. contractor employees alleging that they are the victims of sexual assault or sexual harassment on the job and that Halliburton , KBR and Service Employees International Inc. have not helped them or have obstructed their claims ( Karen Houppert , “ Another KBR Rape Case , ” The Nation , April 3 , 2008 ) .
Dawn Leamon was another civilian contractor employed by KBR who was raped allegedly by KBR employees .
She was the sole medical provider at Camp Harper , a base near Basra in southern Iraq .
Leamon reported being raped anally by a U.S. soldier in January 2008 while a KBR employee forced his penis into her mouth .
She says she was told to keep quiet by her KBR supervisor and by the military liaison officer .
Her laptop computer was seized within hours after she e-mailed a civilian lawyer .
She testified on April 9 , 2008 , before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the hearing “ Closing Legal Loopholes : Prosecuting Sexual Assaults and Other Violent Crimes Committed Overseas by American Civilians in a Combat Environment ” ( foreign.senate.gov/hearings/2008/hrg080409a.html ) .Johnsons ’ Quest Continues in Daughter ’s Death
After two years of requesting documents , the family of Lavena Johnson received a set of papers from the Army that included a photocopy of a compact disk .
Wondering why the copy was among the documents , Dr. Johnson requested the CD itself .
The Army finally complied after a congressman intervened .
When Dr. Johnson viewed the CD , he was shocked to see photographs taken by Army investigators of his daughter ’s body as it lay where her body had been found , as well as other photographs of her disrobed body taken during the investigation .
The photographs revealed that Lavena , barely five feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds , had been struck in the face with a blunt instrument , perhaps a weapon stock .
Her nose was broken and her teeth knocked backward .
One elbow was distended .
The back of her clothes contained debris , indicating she had been dragged .
The photographs of her disrobed body showed bruises , scratch marks and teeth imprints on the upper part of her body .
The right side of her back as well as her right hand had been burned , apparently from a flammable liquid poured on her and then lighted .
Photographs of her genital area revealed massive bruising and lacerations .
A corrosive liquid had been poured into her genital area , probably to destroy DNA evidence of sexual assault .
Despite the bruises , scratches , teeth imprints and burns on her body , Lavena was found completely dressed in the burning tent .
There was a blood trail from outside the contractor ’s tent to inside the tent .
She apparently had been dressed after the attack and her attacker had placed her body in the tent before setting it on fire .
Investigator records reveal that members of her unit said Johnson had told them she was going jogging with friends on the other side of the base .
One unit member walked with her to the post exchange , where she bought a soda , and then , in her Army workout clothes , Johnson went on by herself to meet friends and to exercise .
The unit member said she was in good spirits , showing no indication of personal emotional problems .
The Army investigators initially concluded that Pvt. Johnson ’s death was a homicide and indicated that on their paperwork .
However , a decision apparently was made by higher officials that the investigators would stop the homicide inquiry and classify her death a suicide .
Three weeks later , a final autopsy report from the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , dated Aug. 13 , 2005 , said the cause of death was an intraoral gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was a suicide .
However , the autopsy report — written after the July 22 , 2005 , autopsy at Dover Air Force Base and signed on Aug. 9 , 2005 by associate medical examiner Lt. Cmdr.
Edward Reedy and by chief deputy medical examiner Cmdr. James Caruso — states much more in its opinion section :
“ The 19 year old female , Lavena Johnson , died as a result of a gunshot wound of the head that caused injuries to the skull and brain .
The entrance wound was inside the mouth and injuries to the lips and oral mucosa were a direct result of the discharge of the weapon .
The exit wound was located on the left side of the head .
No bullet or bullet fragments were recovered .
Toxicology was negative for alcohol and other screened drugs .
The investigative information made available indicates that this was a self - inflicted gunshot wound .
With the information surrounding the circumstances of the death that is presently available the manner of death is determined to be suicide . ”
The medical examiners revealed that they were basing their determination of suicide on “ investigative information made available indicat[ing ] that this was a self - inflicted gunshot wound , ” not from medical evidence .
They did not address what caliber of bullet entered her body — in fact , they stated that no bullet or bullet fragment was recovered , and they did not offer comments on what caliber of bullet would have made the entry and exit wounds .
The Aug. 25 , 2005 , report from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory in Forest Park , Ga. , stated :
The characteristic gunshot residue particle indicated on Exhibit 5 ( Gunshot residue kit ( Item 9 , Doc 775-05 ) , the number is considered insignificant .
Based on these results , the report concludes that the following possibilities exist , but the report makes no conclusion :
a . The subject did not handle / discharge a firearm .
b . The subject handled / discharged a firearm but an insignificant number of gunshot residue particles were deposited on the hands .
c. The subject handled / discharged a firearm that deposited a significant number of gunshot residue particles on the hand ; however , due to washing , wiping , or other activity , the particles were reduced to insignificant numbers .
The medical examiners who did the autopsy on Johnson ’s body did not mention any burns on her body , but when the family had gloves that had been glued onto her hands cut off by the funeral home employees in Missouri , they found her hands had been burned , and further examination showed her back was burned .
A witness statement taken on July 19 , 2005 , states : “ The witness [ name redacted ] … found the victim under the bench and verified there were no signs of life … related he saw the M16 lying across the victim ’s body … he did n’t know what setting the weapon was on … he related everything was smoking , including parts of the body .
He called for an ambulance and secured the scene . ”
On April 9 , 2008 , Johnson ’s parents flew from their home in St. Louis for meetings with members of Congress and their staff .
They again went to Washington , D.C. , in July 2008 and were briefed by Army investigators and the military medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on Lavena .
The Army briefers maintained that her death was a suicide and were unable to answer Dr. John and Linda Johnson ’s long list of questions .
The Johnsons are asking for a congressional hearing that would force the Army to further investigate their daughter ’s death .
Murder of Three Women in North Carolina
Some of the circumstances surrounding Lavena Johnson ’s death in Iraq three years ago are similar to those of other American servicewomen who died in recent months .
In the six months from December 2007 to July 2008 , three U.S. military women were killed by military males near the Army ’s Fort Bragg and the Marine Corps ’ Camp Lejeune , two mega - bases in North Carolina .
Two of the women were in the Army .
Spc. Megan Touma was seven months pregnant when her body was found inside a Fayetteville hotel room June 21 , 2008 .
A married male soldier whom she knew in Germany has since been arrested .
The estranged Marine husband of Army 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc has been arrested in her death and the burning of her body .
Marine Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach had been raped in May 2007 and protective orders had been issued against the alleged perpetrator , fellow Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean .
The burned body of Lauterbach and her unborn baby were found in a shallow grave in the backyard of Laurean ’s home in January 2008 .
Laurean fled to Mexico , where he was captured by Mexican authorities .
He is currently awaiting extradition to the United States to stand trial .
Lauterbach ’s mother testified before Congress on July 31 , 2008 , that the Marine Corps ignored warning signs that Laurean was a danger to her daughter ( testimony of Mary Lauterbach to the National Security and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee , nationalsecurity.oversight.house.gov/documents/20080731134039.pdf ) .
Two Women Sexually Assaulted Before Their Deaths
Remarkably , a rape test was not performed on the body of Lavena Johnson although bruising and lacerations in her genital area indicated assault .
Another family that does not believe their daughter committed suicide in Iraq is the family of Pfc. Tina Priest , 20 , of Smithville , Texas , who was reported raped by a fellow soldier in February of 2006 on a military base known as Camp Taji .
Priest was a part of the 5th Support Battalion , lst Brigade Combat Team , 4th Infantry Division from Fort Hood , Texas .
The Army said Priest was found dead in her room on March 1 , 2006 , of a self - inflicted M - 16 shot , 11 days after the rape .
Priest ’s mother , Joy Priest , disputes the Army ’s findings .
Mrs. Priest said she talked several times with her daughter after the rape and that Tina , while very upset about the rape , was not suicidal .
Mrs. Priest continues to challenge the Army ’s 800 pages of investigative documents with a simple question :
How could her five - foot - tall daughter , with a correspondingly short arm length , have held the M - 16 at the angle which would have resulted in the gunshot ?
The Army attempted several explanations , but each was debunked by Mrs. Priest and by the 800 pages of materials provided by the Army itself .
The Army now says Tina used her toe to pull the trigger of the weapon that killed her .
The Army reportedly never investigated Tina ’s death as a homicide , only as a suicide .
According to Tina ’s mother , rape charges against the soldier whose sperm was found on Tina ’s sleeping bag were dropped a few weeks after her death .
He was convicted of failure to obey an order and sentenced to forfeiture of $ 714 for two months , 30 days ’ restriction to the base and 45 days of extra duty .
On May 11 , 2006 , 10 days after Tina Priest was found dead , 19 - year - old Army Pfc. Amy Duerksen was found dead at the same Camp Taji .
Duerksen died three days after she suffered what the Army called “ a self - inflicted gunshot . ”
The Army claimed that she , too , had committed suicide .
In the room where her body was found , investigators reportedly discovered her diary open to a page on which she had written about being raped during training after unknowingly ingesting a date - rape drug .
The person Duerkson identified in her diary as the rapist was charged by the Army with rape after her death .
Many who knew her did not believe she shot herself , but there is no evidence of a homicide investigation by the Army .
Women Had Concerns About Job Irregularities
Three women whose deaths have been classified as suicides had expressed concerns about improprieties or irregularities in their military commands .
Army Spc. Ciara Durkin , 30 , a Massachusetts National Guard payroll clerk , was found dead on Sept. 28 , 2007 , from a gunshot wound to the head .
She had gotten off work 90 minutes earlier and was found lying near a chapel on Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
Durkin had called her brother just hours before she died , leaving an upbeat happy birthday message on his telephone .
In previous conversations , Durkin told her sister that she had discovered something in the finance unit that she did not agree with and that she had made some enemies over it .
She told her sister to keep investigating her death if anything happened to her ( “ How did Specialist Ciara Durkin Die ? ” CBSNews , Oct. 4 , 2007 , cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/04/world/main3328739.shtml ) .
In June 2008 , the Army declared her death a suicide .
Army interrogator Spc. Alyssa Renee Peterson , 27 , assigned to C Company , 311th Military Intelligence Battalion , 101st Airborne Division , Fort Campbell , Ky. , was an Arabic linguist who reportedly was very concerned about the manner in which interrogations of detained Iraqis were being conducted .
She died on Sept. 15 , 2003 , near Tal Afar , Iraq , in what the Army described as a gunshot wound to the head , a noncombat , self - inflicted weapons discharge , or suicide .
Peterson had reportedly objected to the interrogation techniques used on prisoners in Iraq and refused to participate after only two nights working in the unit known as “ the cage . ”
Members of her unit have refused to describe the specific interrogation techniques to which Peterson objected .
The military says that all records of those techniques have now been destroyed .
After refusing to conduct more interrogations , Peterson was assigned to guard the base gate , where she monitored Iraqi guards .
She was also sent to suicide prevention training .
Army investigators concluded she shot and killed herself with her service rifle on the night of Sept. 15 , 2003 .
Family members challenge the Army ’s conclusion .
Maj .
Gloria Davis , 47 , an 18 - year Army veteran , mother and grandmother , was found dead of a gunshot wound on Dec. 12 , 2006 , the day after she reportedly talked at length to an Army investigator about corruption in military contracting .
She had been accused of accepting a $ 225,000 bribe from Lee Dynamics , a defense contractor that provided warehouse space for the storage of automatic weapons in Iraq ( Eric Schmitt and James Glanz , “ U.S. Says Company Bribes Officers for Work in Iraq , ” New York Times , Aug. 31 , 2007 ) .
Davis ’ mother , Annie Washington , told the author that military investigators have never located any of the $ 225,000 Davis is alleged to have taken .
Washington said her daughter was right - handed and would have had a hard time holding the weapon in her left hand and shooting herself on the left side of her head ( telephone conversation between Ann Wright and Annie Washington , July 2008 ) .
Federal court documents show that the Army suspended Lee Dynamics from contracting on July 9 , 2007 , over allegations that the company paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to numerous U.S. officers in Iraq and Kuwait in 2004 and 2005 to get contracts to build , operate and maintain warehouses in Iraq where weapons , uniforms and vehicles for the Iraqi military were stored .
Reportedly included in the documents was a seven - page statement by an Army investigator who questioned Maj .
Davis the day before she was found dead in her quarters .
The deposition has apparently been used in ongoing federal cases on corruption in military contracting ( Ed Blanche , “ Kickbacks , Weapons and Suicide : The US Army ’s Battle With Corruption , ” March 15 , 2008 , kippreport.com/article.php?articleid=1056&page=1 ) .
The author attempted to obtain a copy of Davis ’ statement from the Department of Justice , but a DoJ public affairs officer said the statement is not yet in the public domain and intimated that it is being used in other ongoing DoJ investigations into contracting fraud ( telephone conversation on July 28 , 2008 , with DoJ public affairs officer ) .
The Lee Dynamics warehouses were part of a circle of corruption involving military personnel and contractors throughout Iraq and the disappearance of 190,000 U.S. - supplied weapons — 110,000 AK - 47 assault rifles and 80,000 pistols intended for Iraqi security forces for which the U.S. military cannot account .
A July 2007 Government Accountability Office report said that until December 2005 the U.S. - Iraqi training command had no centralized records on weapons provided to Iraqi forces , and although 185,000 AK - 47 rifles , 170,000 pistols , 215,000 sets of body armor and 140,000 steel helmets had been issued by September 2005 , because of poor record keeping it was unclear what happened to 110,000 AK - 47s and 80,000 pistols and more than half the armor and helmets ( GAO Report 07 - 711 , Stabilizing Iraq : DOD Cannot Ensure That U.S. - Funded Equipment Has Reached Iraqi Security Forces , July 2007 , Pages 14 and 15 , gao.gov/new.items/d07711.pdf ) .
In December 2007 , the U.S. military acknowledged that it had lost track of an additional 12,000 weapons , including more than 800 machine guns ( Ed Blanche , “ Kickbacks , Weapons and Suicide : The US Army ’s Battle With Corruption , ” March 15 , 2008 , kippreport.com/article.php?articleid=1056&page=1 ) .
In 2005 , Col . Ted Westhusing , 44 , at the time the highest - ranking officer to die in Iraq , allegedly committed suicide after reportedly becoming despondent about the poor performance of private contractors who were training Iraqi police , for which he was responsible .
After graduating third in his West Point class and serving as the honor captain for the entire academy his senior year , Westhusing became one of the Army ’s leading scholars on military ethics and was a professor at West Point .
In January 2005 Westhusing began supervising the training of Iraqi forces to take over security duties from the U.S. military .
He oversaw the Virginia - based USIS , a private security contractor , which had contracts worth $ 79 million to train a corps of Iraqi police to conduct special - operations missions .
Westhusing was upset about allegations , in a four - page anonymous letter , that USIS deliberately shorted the Iraqi government on the number of trainers it provided in order to increase its profit margin .
The letter also revealed two incidents in which USIS contractors allegedly had witnessed or participated in the killing of Iraqi civilians .
After an angry counseling meeting with the contractor , Westhusing was found dead of a gunshot wound .
Many of Westhusing ’s professional colleagues question the Army ’s ruling of suicide , despite the note found in his quarters .
They point out that Westhusing did not have a bodyguard and was surrounded by the same contractors he suspected of wrongdoing .
They also question why the USIS company manager who discovered Westhusing ’s body was not tested for gunpowder residue .
In the space of three months in 2006 , three members of the U.S. Army who had been part of a contracting and logistics group in Kuwait and Iraq were accused of taking bribes from contractors and allegedly committed suicide .
Two of them were women , Maj. Gloria Davis and Sgt. Denise Lannaman , and the third was Lt. Col. Marshall Gutierrez .
In August 2006 Gutierrez was arrested at a restaurant in Kuwait and was accused of shaking down a laundry contractor for a $ 3,400 bribe .
He was allowed to return to his quarters and was found dead on Sept. 4 , 2006 , with an empty bottle of prescription sleeping pills and an open container of what appeared to be antifreeze .
The second woman soldier who was allegedly involved with bribes and allegedly committed suicide was New York Army National Guard Sgt. Denise A. Lannaman .
Lannaman , 46 , had completed one tour in Tikrit , Iraq , in 2005 .
In December 2005 she decided to volunteer to stay in Iraq longer and took an assignment at a desk job at a procurement office in Camp Arifjan , Kuwait , that purchased millions of dollars in supplies .
She received excellent performance ratings , and her supervisor said that her oversight eliminated misuse of funds by 36 percent .
On Oct. 1 , 2006 , Lannaman was questioned by a senior officer about the death of Lt. Col .
Gutierrez and was reportedly told by that officer that she was implicated in the contracting fraud and would be leaving the military in disgrace .
She was found in a jeep dead of a gunshot later that day .
The Army has classified Lannaman ’s death as a suicide .
A member of her family said that Lannaman had a history of psychiatric problems but somehow been allowed to enlist in the military .
She had attempted suicide four times in her life , according to the family member .
In September 2007 , Army spokesman Lt. Col.
William Wiggins told the family that Lannaman had not been the subject of any contract investigations , but he said he could not say whether Lannaman had been threatened by a superior officer with dismissal from the service ( Jim Dwyer , “ Letter from America : Journey from New York to Kuwait , and Suicide , ” New York Times , Sept. 19 , 2007 ) .
Lannaman ’s family said that because of her pre-existing mental state , the threat that the superior officer made to send her home in disgrace could have caused her to take her life .
Soldiers Convicted of Bribery
In June 2008 four persons plead guilty in bribery and kickback scandals concerning military contracts in Iraq .
On June 11 , 2008 , recently retired Army National Guard Col.
Levonda Joey Selph , a key person on Gen. David Petraeus ’ team that was training and equipping Iraqi security forces in 2004 and 2005 , pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy .
She admitted disclosing to the owner of Lee Dynamics International confidential bidding information about a $ 12 - million contract for building and operating U.S. military warehouses in Iraq that stored automatic weapons and other equipment .
Lee Dynamics International is the same company that reportedly gave Maj .
Davis a $ 225,000 bribe .
Col .
Selph helped the company owner , a former Army pay clerk , to submit “ fake bid packages on behalf of six companies he controlled to create a false sense of competition , ” for which she was given a trailer valued at $ 20,000 ; she eventually returned the trailer , and the contractor then gave her $ 4,000 in cash and paid for air fare and accommodations for a trip to Thailand in October 2005 , valued at about $ 5,000 .
Selph has since agreed to pay the U.S. government $ 9,000 and could serve a prison sentence of up to two years ( Eric Schmitt , “ Guilty Plea Given in Iraq Contract Fraud , ” New York Times , June 11 , 2008 ) .
After having been in military custody since July 2007 , Army Maj .
John Cockerham , 43 , pleaded guilty last January to bribery , conspiracy and money laundering in awarding illegal contracts for supplies such as bottled water .
He had received more than $ 9 million in bribes from at least eight defense contractor companies , and records found in his home indicated he expected to get $ 5.4 million more .
Melissa Cockerham , Cockerham ’s wife , also pleaded guilty to money laundering .
Their plea bargains were kept under federal court seal until June 25 , 2008 , while they cooperated with investigators .
Cockerham faces up to 40 years in prison , while his wife could face up to 20 years in prison ( Dana Hedgpeth , “ 2 Plead Guilty to Army Bribery Scheme , ” Washington Post , June 25 , 2008 ) .
The Death of Spc. Keisha Morgan
Army Spc. Keisha Morgan , 25 , was on her second tour in Iraq .
Just days before her February 22 , 2008 , death , she called her mother , Diana Morgan , and happily told her that she had reenlisted .
Her mother said that Keisha wanted to be a nurse and planned to fulfill that ambition after she got out of the Army .
Assigned to the Fourth Infantry Division , Fort Hood , Texas , Keisha reportedly suffered two seizures in her barracks at Camp Taji and died in a military hospital in Bagdad .
The Army reportedly told Keisha ’s mother that Keisha was on antidepressants and may have overdosed .
In a blog , Keisha ’s mother said her daughter had never mentioned being on antidepressants .
However , the Army reportedly frequently prescribes antidepressants to soldiers with anxiety from effects of war , and one of the known side effects of some of the depressants is seizures .
The Army ’s fifth Mental Health Advisory Team report indicates that , according to an anonymous survey of U.S. troops taken in the fall of 2007 , about 12 percent of combat troops in Iraq and 17 percent of those in Afghanistan are taking prescription antidepressants ( such as Prozac and Zoloft ) or sleeping pills ( such as Ambien ) to help them cope , with about 50 percent taking antidepressants and 50 percent taking prescription sleeping pills .
In 2007 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the warning on antidepressants that the drugs may increase the risk of suicide in children and young adults ages 18 to 24 , the age group most taking prescribed drugs in the Army .
The Army should question whether there is a link between the increased use of the drugs by military troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and the rising suicide rate , which is now double the Army ’s suicide rate in 2001 .
Deception or Just Incompetence ?
It ’s now well known that there was deception by the U.S. military in the friendly fire death of Pat Tillman and the decision to make a heroic character out of Pvt. Jessica Lynch ( oversight.house.gov/documents/20080714111050.pdf ) .
But there are many other cases of deception and of misinformation given to families .
After much pressure from the families for more information on the deaths of their sons in 2004 , the parents of Army Spc. Patrick McCaffery and 1st Lt. Andre Tyson were finally told by the Army two years after the death of their sons that they were not killed by insurgents but by Iraqi army recruits with whom they were training and patrolling ( democracynow.org/2006/6/23/army_lies_to_mother_of_slain ) .
The parents of Spc. Jesse Buryj were initially told their son died in an accident .
After relentless pressure on the Army for a copy of the autopsy , his mother read that Buryj had died of a gunshot wound .
She had to request through the Freedom of Information
Act a copy of the incident report , which states he was killed by friendly fire from coalition Polish troops .
And later a soldier from Buryj ’s unit came to her home and told her he had been killed by “ one of our own troops ” ( democracynow.org/2006/3/15/sunshine_week_newspapers_and_broadcasters_challenge ) .
Karen Meredith had to request the report on the May 30 , 2004 , death of her son , 1st Lt. Ken Ballard , through the Freedom of Information Act .
Ballard did not die in a firefight with insurgents as she was originally told ( arlingtoncemetery.net/kmballard.htm ) .
He actually died in an accident when a branch fell on a tank in which he was riding and set off an unmanned gun ( mydd.com/story /2005/9/12/14492/7912 ) .
On Sept. 9 , 2005 , Meredith met with an Army colonel in the Pentagon and received a letter of apology from the Army for its misinformation on her son ’s death .
On Sept. 27 , 2005 , she met with Secretary of the Army Francis Harvey and asked him to promise that soldiers ’ families would promptly be told the truth about casualties .
As the Beaumont , Texas , newspaper the Enterprise stated in its June 20 , 2008 , editorial , “ There is no excuse for the U.S. Army ’s shabby treatment of Kamisha Block ’s parents and others who cared for her .
Her commanders knew right away that she had been killed by a fellow soldier in Iraq , who had been harassing her .
It was a standard murder - suicide .
Incredibly , the Army first told her parents that it was an accidental death due to friendly fire . ”
A few days later , the Army changed its story and told the parents of Spc. Block that their daughter had been murdered by a shot to the chest .
At the funeral home in Vidor , Texas , Block ’s mother noticed her daughter had a wound to her head , not mentioned by the Army .
Six months later , after numerous phone calls to the Army and enlisting help from Congressman Kevin Brady , Block ’s family was told by the Army that she had been murdered by a fellow soldier in her unit , a man who had physically assaulted her three times .
His unit had disciplined him once but kept him in the same unit where he assaulted Block two other times before he murdered her by firing five shots into her and then killing himself in the same barracks room .
After many attempts , the parents finally received a 1,200 - page investigation that gave the name of the murderer .
Our Soldiers ’ Families Deserve Better
The families of slain soldiers deserve the truth about how they served and how they died .
A professional military should handle each case with utmost care and concern .
Tragically , in the past seven years , too many families have been faced with unanswered questions and a military bureaucracy that closes ranks against those who are trying to find answers .
I appeal to those in our military who know how these women died to come forward .
Hopefully , the House Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee , chaired by Rep. Susan Davis , ( 202 ) 225-2040 , will hold hearings on military suicides in the next two months and provide protection from retaliation for those willing to testify .

This is the text of a talk given at the sixth annual Pigstock , held at Windbeam Farm in Hager City , Wisconsin and sponsored by Veterans For Peace , Chapter 115 in Red Wing , Minnesota on July 12 , 2008 .
I want to start out today with something written by an early American revolutionary .
This man was key to the armed revolution we fought against the King of England beginning in 1776 , and more than that , was key to the revolution of ideas that had begun to grip the American colonies for several generations .
This man was born poor , remained poor throughout his life , and he died in a tenement house .
Yet , he was also a key American statesmen , publisher , orator , and held a number of government positions .
He was a friend of Thomas Jefferson , and he was throughout his life , a self - educated person who valued liberty and justice .
He opposed the concentrated power of the hereditary elites , and he believed that imperial wars were immoral .
His name was Thomas Paine .
During the winter of the first year of revolution , in what would be the second of a series of pamphlets called The American Crisis , he described what we were fighting .
It ’s a long quote , but I want you to hear what he had to say :
If ever a nation was mad and foolish , blind to its own interest and bent on its own destruction , it is Britain .
There are such things as national sins , and though the punishment of individuals may be reserved to another world , national punishment can only be inflicted in this world .
Britain , as a nation , is , in my inmost belief , the greatest and most ungrateful offender against God on the face of the whole earth .
Blessed with all the commerce she could wish for , and furnished , by a vast extension of dominion , with the means of civilizing both the eastern and western world , she has made no other use of both than proudly to idolize her own “ thunder , ” and rip up the bowels of whole countries for what she could get .
Like Alexander , she has made war her sport , and inflicted misery for prodigality ’s sake .
The blood of India is not yet repaid , nor the wretchedness of Africa yet requited .
Of late she has enlarged her list of national cruelties by her butcherly destruction of the Caribbs of St. Vincent ’s , and returning an answer by the sword to the meek prayer for “ Peace , liberty and safety . ”
These are serious things , and whatever a foolish tyrant , a debauched court , a trafficking legislature , or a blinded people may think , the national account with heaven must some day or other be settled : all countries have sooner or later been called to their reckoning ; the proudest empires have sunk when the balance was struck ; and Britain , like an individual penitent , must undergo her day of sorrow , and the sooner it happens to her the better .
Tom Paine was observing the imperial stance of Great Britain , circa 1777 .
His audience was an army of ragtag revolutionaries who were faced with limited funding , a series of military losses against a great imperial army , and diffidence and doubt of a majority of their friends and neighbors .
The revolutionary war depended on the leadership and ideas of the landed and wealthy class in the American colony — yet many of this class were opposed to both independence and to republicanism , seeing it as a threat to their own property and position .
In describing Great Britain — arguably near the height of her glory — Paine told the truth .
A nation blessed with great wealth , and great commerce , had proudly idolized her own “ thunder , ” ripping up the bowels of whole countries for what she could get — this country would and should receive its due in this world , not in the next one .
This , of course , happens to be the legacy of our current president , George W. Bush .
Paine describes another George , George the III , who had been levying new taxes to raise government funds to pay previous British war debt — as a foolish tyrant , unconstrained by a debauched court , mollified and motivated by a " trafficking legislature " and lastly , tolerated by a blinded people .
One wonders what Thomas Paine would say about the United States today .
On reading his words , I was certainly struck by how well it describes America ’s government today , how well it describes our courts , our legislatures , and sadly , many of our people .
We have a judiciary that generally does not understand the Constitution , as originally written with its first ten amendments .
Some would argue that the Supreme Court recently got it right on the Heller case , a Second Amendment case .
In the sense that five of nine judges think that the right to bear arms is an individual right , they did .
But in determining that a wide variety of government restrictions and constraints on private ownership of weapons is constitutional , the door is open for no change in the status quo at all .
As with England of the 1700s , no change in the status quo is what Washington wants , at home and abroad .
I bring up the second amendment because my talk today is on how we can prevent and end wars , and the waste , corruption , tragedy and wholesale destruction of lives and livelihoods it entails .
Most who protest war valiantly work to exercise their rights of assembly and speech , their rights to due process , to have a speedy and public day in court , to never be forced into self - incrimination , or to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment .
Yet many who oppose war for all the right reasons also have some ambiguity about the idea of weapons in the hands of average people .
Fewer people who oppose the wars of the state demand to see the second amendment exercised broadly and openly here at home , and fewer still really take the third amendment seriously .
Remember the third amendment ?
The third amendment prohibits the quartering of soldiers in private homes , which in the 1700s meant that soldiers might come through your home or farm , slaughter some of your sheep or cattle , take a horse , and have you make their beds , and feed them out of your pantry for a day or a week or a month .
In the list of grievances contained in the declaration of independence , these offenses were described as follows :
[ The king ] has erected a multitude of New Offices , and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people , and eat out their substance .
He has kept among us , in times of peace , Standing Armies without the consent of our legislatures .
He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power .
… For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us :
For protecting them , by a mock Trial , from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States :
We like to think the third amendment is passé , old - school .
Last year , in 2007 , the federal government alone collected $ 2.6 trillion in taxes , making its take nearly 20 % of US Gross Domestic Product .
With a significant proportion of this money , the government wages war around the globe , and increases the size of what the founders referred to as a standing army .
Furthermore , to finance the wars and the empire , the government produces paper money — causing inflation , which is just another tax , another theft of the people ’s wealth and property .
The crux of the third amendment is that we the people own our property and our earnings — they are not to be consumed at will by a government , stolen from us without a proper bill of sale or reimbursement , on behalf of the wars of unaccountable governments and kings .
There is no doubt that we owe reparations to Iraq , for the wanton damage done there .
That price will go unpaid , of course , as it generally does .
But what about what is owed to Americans for the expense of Iraq ?
The war ’s cost is now running at nearly $ 5000 for every household in America — and those are using the Pentagons numbers that show the invasion and occupation of Iraq consuming half a trillion dollars so far .
Nobel laureate in economics Joe Stiglitz and his team calculated a few years ago that this was a two trillion dollar expense on the people of this country , and they are now projecting a three trillion dollar neo-colonialization in Iraq .
His latest book , with Linda Bilmes , is entitled The Three Trillion Dollar War .
That ’s 30 thousand bucks for each household in America .
The third amendment IS relevant , and using tax receipts for unlawful and unjust war , or worse , borrowed money our children and grandchildren must pay , is a clear violation of the third amendment of the Constitution in our 21st century world .
A quick reminder on the bill of rights — it does not delineate rights granted by government to us — but unalienable rights we have by virtue of our existence as human beings .
Welcome to the enlightenment , circa 1776 .
We have these rights not because we vote , or pay our taxes , or keep our front yards mowed properly , not because we wear a flag pin or have a support the troops sticker on our car or are legal citizens — we have the rights simply and wholly because we exist as human beings , endowed thusly by our Creator .
Government — king , president or congress — has no business interfering with , redefining , or constraining these rights .
That ’s what these first ten amendments are saying to the federal level — they say , quite clearly , back off .
Do n’t tread on me .
Why should anyone be paying for the Iraq War , anyway ?
The fact that we ca n’t even describe why we are there with a straight face epitomizes the gross immorality of the whole venture .
I ’ve long held that those who wish to liberate Iraqis , or secure greater Israel , or colonize Iraq for its strategic location and resources ought to be free to suit up and take it on .
Strangely , the ideologues , particularly neoconservatives and warmongering Christian preachers in big churches across this country seem the least likely to venture beyond the sound bites into a real , bloody , soul - ripping battlefield .
But I digress .
If we wish to stop a war , any particular war — we have to stand against all wars .
Wars are created , designed , implemented and lost by the state , by governments .
War is the health of the state , as Randolph Bourne wrote .
By definition , the state is a centralized re-allocator of wealth and justice — like a parasite and contrary to popular opinion , it produces neither wealth nor justice .
The state uses war primarily to increase and to exercise its own nature .
When there is a war on — whether a war on drugs , a war on terrorism , a war against the Japanese , the Vietnamese , the Iraqis , the Iranians , the Venezuelans , the Cubans , the insurgents , you name it — citizens are no longer completely free to move within and travel beyond the country .
Citizens are now subject to unwarranted detention , restriction , surveillance , and all without government accountability — because there ’s a war on .
In a state of war , government openly breaks the law , and tells us we are " safer " for it .
When the state is at war — the government apparatus seems more justified , more needed , and we the people — if we are frightened and uneducated in history and economics and common sense — tend to make excuses for government stupidity and overreach .
That is , until we begin to feel angry over a reduced standard of living , high gas and food prices , and we actually start to notice how incredibly banal and inane our politicians really are .
There is no good war — and I think conservative politico Pat Buchanan has done a great job in his new book examining that so - called good war , World War II .
But why does it take so many years after the fact to come to that conclusion ?
Vietnam is a good case in point — Daniel Ellsworth and many of his peers in the Pentagon , uniformed officers , understood the war must end in 1967 .
Yet we did not leave Vietnam until 1975 , after nearly 50,000 more young Americans had died there .
For what ?
Why does it take so long ?
Today , Iraq and Afghanistan are still active wars .
Five years running , and if you ask the Congress or the people , they will all say , yes , we ought to come home , the sooner the better .
But Congress votes more money to sustain Iraq operations , and we the people continue to consent to it , silently .
No wonder the antiwar movement is frustrated .
Many hope a different president will make a difference , you know , like that different congress did a few years ago .
But Obama and McCain are political peas in a pod — both will illegally continue the Iraq fiasco until we are departing from our monster embassy roof under heavy fire .
It is time for a revolution , not dissimilar from that whereby Englishmen living in America asserted their own self - rule .
Asserting self - rule — this is not unlike the recent Ron Paul campaign within the GOP establishment .
And the word " revolution " has certainly been popularized by the Ron Paul campaign , which broke new ground and tapped into a strain of independence that has been percolating in this country for a long time .
The Ron Paul revolution is peaceful , a war of ideas , of education and of principle .
It works through communication , discussion , and raising the historical and economic understanding of enough Americans so that real change happens , as the whole transforms .
I hope that the revolution will be peaceful , but I suspect that to win this war against our own warmongering state , we need to , at a very minimum , strengthen the obstinacy of our passive resistance , our civil disobedience .
A real strength of the greater antiwar movement is in raising awareness of the costs of war , the immorality of it , clarifying to the many taxpayers and families who generally support the government that the Iraq invasion and planned occupation was — as most wars have been — the result of crimes and misdemeanors — not in a foreign country , but in Washington .
However — where a revolution is needed , we have a problem in the antiwar movement , a problem that has crippled its effectiveness .
Who are we ?
Intellectuals and disillusioned soldiers .
Mothers and grandmothers and fathers of soldiers , people who have paid some price , who have some keen awareness that war is waste , destruction , and wrong - headed .
But who are Americans — the " we the people " who truly have the power to bring down whole governments ?
These people are busy and hard - working , and many do n’t have time to watch five minutes of the mainstream media between picking up kids , the second part - time job , or taking care of grandkids and aging parents .
Many are consciously anti-intellectual !
Headline news , neoconservative talk radio , and fast food takeout have all capitalized on the fact that people in American do n’t have time to think a single reflective thought .
Of those who do have time on their hands , the preteens , teenagers , underemployed younger and older people , many have been so impacted by a cultural disrespect for learning that they cannot be reached by traditional top - down educational approaches .
Yet — these same people do understand — they do get that there is something very wrong in this country .
They get that a good country is about rule of law and justice , but they see a reality that is lawless and unjust .
They understand that our political leadership is clownish at best , and evil at worst .
They have contempt for political parties , and no time for political foolishness posing as serious debate .
Many of them watch the Colbert Report and link up to The Onion to get their news — and it works for them .
They have already stepped outside of the political mainstream , and both pro-government and anti-government forces complain that " the people " have become self - absorbed , focusing only on what matters in their own personal life and ignoring the larger picture .
And how is the antiwar movement selling the message to the people out there who must be on board if you want to end American wars , and become a prosperous country again ?
We are telling the 60 % in the country who are disengaged — and they are disengaged for good reason — that they should vote !?
We are telling them that in the future , they should support a state that will give them health care and funded social security , instead of one that is wasting incredible resources today in a distant war for hegemony in the Middle East .
Think about it — if antiwar voices love the state , its taxation and financial schemes , and value the state ’s ability to take care of all our needs — it ’s just the wars of the state we do n’t like — that message is way too complicated to be picked up quickly and to motivate more thinking of the kind that citizens must do .
That message is also about as true as those first budget estimates for the war in Iraq when the White House told us that it would n’t exceed $ 50 billion and Iraqi oil would pay for it .
The state needs war , it craves war , and it will have war .
If you love the state , you necessarily love war .
If you respect the state , you embrace war .
And some , perhaps many , in the antiwar movement , really believe that the state , that national level government , is or can be a real source of solutions for community and for the country .
This is the first problem that the antiwar movement faces — and that is its hypocrisy .
Much of it still loves the state .
And for the 60 % of the people out there who are disengaged but sense that something is very wrong in this country — they sense that what is wrong is indeed the state — the government .
The judicial and incarceration system here ( including the war on drugs , three - strikes mandates that disallow common sense in sentencing , incredible focus on victimless crimes that has caused this country to incarcerate at some time 1 in every 99 Americans ) — this system is a self - perpetuating juggernaut , consuming lives and creating make - work jobs that produce no security , no rehabilitation , no innovation and no value .
And we — average Americans — have to pay for it .
The social security system — sure it ’s great — but when average and especially younger Americans see that for every older person living on a fixed income and barely making ends meet , there are two or more others who are collecting social security for vacations , golf club memberships , and going to Vegas six times a year .
Here ’s a fact that we do n’t talk about — but much of America senses .
The median income for singles and couples over age 65 has nearly doubled since the 1960s — even after adjusting for inflation .
We defend the government taking care of us in our old age — yet in hard times , this argument does n’t fly for the 60 % of disengaged Americans — many of whom are under age 65 — and who are financially responsible for these current insolvent government programs , and who do n’t expect to see the favors reciprocated in their own old age .
I have attacked the penal and justice system , the expensive and counterproductive government war on drugs , social security — what about the government education system ?
That is a hugely expensive service , albeit mostly funded by the states and local governments — and are we getting readers , informed young people , thinkers and entrepreneurs from that system ?
You know the answer to that .
If antiwar activists want to activate the rest of the uninvolved and underinformed country to resist the state on its overseas wars — we ca n’t have it both ways .
Chances of someone knowing a soldier who has died in Iraq , Afghanistan , Panama , and Vietnam or as a result of poisoning on the battlefield , suicide , and other war - related deaths — we are talking maybe two million people out of 300 million .
But the chances of being personally exposed to the state justice system — well that ’s 1 in 100 .
Knowing a social security recipient who is better off than the young taxpayer who is paying that bill — probably one in 20 .
Having processed through a particularly idiotic and authority - obsessed public school education — make that just about everyone .
Being aware of corruption in the political system , be it local , state or federal ?
Well , I suspect even tiny babies have heard of this .
My point is — we must understand that war is the federal government ’s lifeblood — and to end war we really have to starve , disable , restrict , constrain that state .
We ask that Washington take the money it is spending on war — those trillions of dollars — and instead rebuild the country ’s infrastructure , solve the education , health care , and aging - population crisis .
But what do we get ?
Always , more spending , and always more war .
It is easy to understand — this country is economically oriented around offensive and security related industry .
So when government gets a buck , it is beholden to the security , offensive and war - related lobbyists , industrial and political .
It really ca n’t help itself .
I believe that most Americans at some level understand this .
A July 3rd Rasmussen poll on the constitution revealed that " only 14 % of voters think the Constitution places too many restrictions on what government can do , while 39 % say it is not restrictive enough and 38 % say it ’s about right as is .
Fifty - nine percent ( 59 % ) say the bigger danger in the world today is a government that is too powerful .
Only 23 % worry more about a government that is not powerful enough . "
Because this is how they feel , frankly — they are not convinced when antiwar activists promise that war moneys can be diverted or altered by a big government to do actual good things for people .
I mean , is n’t that the lesson the average people got from Katrina ?
My God , we had federal agencies and the army down there — and yet the only rebuilding , the only productive work is being done by individuals and entrepreneurs , local people and their sweat equity .
Americans already understand that the state loves war — what they need to get more consistently from antiwar activists is that our enemy is this very same state .
This is a hard pill to swallow .
But constitutional constraints on federal powers were designed by people we still admire today — who believed that to keep tyranny and war at bay , you need to keep the federal government small , perpetually underfunded , and of course , the antifederalists opposed any form of central government bank that could print money to get out from under this chronic underfunding situation .
It is no coincidence that the 20th century was an era of state murder , setting fantastic global records of human slaughter by governments , and it was also the century of national and state banks , whereby government could fund wars without actually asking the people if they wanted these wars .
Now — if you buy this argument that to end war we must strangle the state , send it to its room for some long deserved time - out , how do we do that short of armed revolution ?
We can vote , but that ’s mainly symbolic .
Remember , urging people to vote in many ways , undermines credibility of the movement , especially after the 2004 elections , where many antiwar candidates were brought to Washington .
Common sense evidence tells us that voting at the federal level is about as effective as it was for the soviets in the old Soviet Union .
They voted religiously for the establishment ’s candidates , and had near 100 % turnout for elections .
But nothing changed until the people and the elites together got the message that the stupidity was n’t working .
The ludicrosity and humor of voting , by the way , seems to be accurately portrayed in the new movie , Swing Vote .
In an imaginary world , one man ’s vote changes a national election — a wonderfully entertaining concept .
Of course , what changes government is awakening the national imagination .
A very different thing than voting .
We can keep educating people about what is happening in our overseas wars , but most people do n’t have time for the ugly reality , unless it directly affects them .
We can boycott government agencies and politicians and media that are pro-war , point out their inconsistencies , their crimes , their sellouts to defense industries and prowar lobbies .
We can boycott the primary offensive industries .
Do not allow one red cent of yours to support or patronize companies who get a large proportion of their income on the state ’s business of misnamed defensive security .
And let the company execs know what you are doing .
Or — take an alternative approach — become a stockholder and try to create havoc in the company that way .
This takes some effort , but it ’s something some people will be able to do .
We can boycott agencies and entities that advertise in support of the state .
Unfortunately — this means no more mainstream news , mainstream newspapers and magazines , and turning off much of the radio .
How many of you have heard Boeing and Lockheed Martin advertising on the radio and TV , patriotic , prowar advertisements ?
Or seen the big print ads in newspapers and magazines ?
What , we are going to buy a C - 5 next week ?
These ads are n’t for us as much as they are to ensure positive press — these big ads signify who really owns the media .
We say the corporate media — well — it is the military - industrial complex corporations who ensure that CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS and FOX , and New York Times , and Washington Post dutifully reprint and rebroadcast the White House talking points on the goodness of this war or that .
We demonize our idiot president and vice president .
But they are n’t paying for all this prowar bull —
Dick Cheney has n’t touched his $ 50 million stash to buy a single ad on one of the major news outlets .
He does n’t have to .
What else can we do ?
We might be able to end our employment in the warfare state , and the military industrial complex .
This might be hard to do , but if we have to devote our talents and energies to a government - or offense - oriented job to survive and feed our families , we might do so with our eyes open .
Without a loyalty to the perpetual warfare mission that is often rationalized as patriotism .
If we need to work for the warfare state or its enabler , the military - industrial establishment , then we should be aware of our larger responsibility to the country — to keep it honest .
To blow the whistle when it needs to be blown , and certainly to support whistleblowers when they do what they have to do .
If we attend church or support a charity — we ought to be sure that church and charity is n’t taking state funds under the auspices of doing good works .
We do not tend to bite the hand that feeds us — and yet , that hand must be bitten if we want to end the American empire , and bring the troops home .
We can keep our friends and acquaintances out of the warfare state meat grinder .
This means talking about hard issues like the meaning of citizenship , the ideals of the constitution , the meaning of patriotism — and for those who attend a church that confuses the state with a higher power , educating your pastor and your congregations — or leaving that church .
We can encourage and enable our kids and grandkids to stay away from the state - funded education system , and to learn to think for themselves .
We can work to reduce the income of the federal government .
Pay less taxes .
Earn less , earn in cash , pay in cash , donate as much as you can , maybe set up a scholarship for a college kid so he does n’t have to take a student loan and be beholden to the state , do whatever you can to pay fewer taxes to the state .
Millions of people are doing this voluntarily and due to the recession , because they have to .
But if it constrains the state — it is a good thing .
If we send less human and capital booty to the state — it follows that we should demand less of it as well .
Make the Congress both poor , and irrelevant to our lives .
If we do that , the lobbyists will evaporate .
We demand campaign and lobbying reform — but organizations and companies purchase votes in congress because it is a cheap deal for those who want to use the government to gain a political or more likely business advantage .
Make it not only a cheap deal , but a worthless deal , because the congress has so little largesse to redistribute .
Problem solved .
To be opposed to political war is the moral and correct position .
We know this from our history , and we know this from our ethical and religious upbringing .
On this , we are on the right side .
If we do nothing at all in limiting and opposing war , we will still win , because imperial wars especially go bankrupt , and decline , and finally end .
Imperial and indebted governments , unaccountable to the people that pay for them , collapse and are destroyed .
We do n’t need to hasten this if we do n’t want to , because the sins of the nation must and will be paid in full .
As Thomas Paine said , " the national account with heaven must some day or other be settled : all countries have sooner or later been called to their reckoning ; the proudest empires have sunk when the balance was struck . "
In that lengthy quote I used at the beginning of this talk , I left off a final sentence .
Tom Paine continued , very kindly , " like an individual penitent , [ Britain ] must undergo her day of sorrow , and the sooner it happens to her the better .
As I wish it over , I wish it to come , but withal wish that it may be as light as possible . "
We are on the right side , at least if America is to someday be a peaceful , constitutional republic , prosperous and free , happy and again a model for the rest of the world .
We need do nothing at all and we will still be correct in our antiwar position , and our antiwar beliefs .
But if we love our country , and believe in her , we do need to step up the revolution , and we need to fully understand that the health of the state is war .
To excise war from the state , we will indeed need to excise a large portion of the state with it .
If we act , we may be able to save our country , and help her weather the major shift from a war - based existence to one based on peace and liberty .
Tom Paine was libertarian , but he was not an anarchist , nor was he a pacifist .
When you read his writings on democracy and his writings on the proper role of government , he epitomizes many of the concerns on social and economic justice , as well as peace , that recall the Democratic Party of the late 1960s .
Most libertarians and members of the old - right — devoted as they are to small government and strong communities — are antiwar .
Ron Paul ran a remarkable campaign that tapped into this underground river of American political thought .
But many so - called libertarians reflexively support the state when it comes to war , seeing it as either useful or patriotic .
The larger body of antiwar sentiment in this country is found in those traditional democrats who naturally feel a connection to Thomas Jefferson , Jefferson ’s great friend and fellow idealist Tom Paine , and to the antiwar sentiments of Eugene McCarthy and of Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel .
For the antiwar movement to succeed in the near - term , and to bring real peace , we need to do what we can to connect with that majority — to mobilize the minds of those people — and we need to do so through , as Thomas Paine saw it , common sense , not by blowing smoke up the collective skirt of the country .
To end wars and sustain peace , the state — epitomized by the great gilded castles , tyrants and war traffickers of Washington , DC — must be strangled , and the antiwar movement must lead this charge , in thought and in deed .
The Best of Karen Kwiatkowski
Our proposed statute would provide that the president must consult with Congress before ordering a “ significant armed conflict ”  defined as combat operations that last or are expected to last more than a week .
To provide more clarity than the 1973 War Powers Resolution , our statute also defines what types of hostilities would not be considered significant armed conflicts  for example , training exercises , covert operations or missions to protect and rescue Americans abroad .
If secrecy or other circumstances precluded prior consultation , then consultation  not just notification  would need to be undertaken within three days .
To guarantee that the president consults with a cross section of Congress , the act would create a joint Congressional committee made up of the leaders of the House and the Senate as well as the chairmen and ranking members of key committees .
These are the members of Congress with whom the president would need to personally consult .
Almost as important , the act would establish a permanent , bipartisan staff with access to all relevant intelligence and national - security information .
Congress would have obligations , too .
Unless it declared war or otherwise expressly authorized a conflict , it would have to vote within 30 days on a resolution of approval .
If the resolution of approval was defeated in either House , any member of Congress could propose a resolution of disapproval .
Such a resolution would have the force of law , however , only if it were passed by both houses and signed by the president or the president ’s veto were overridden .
If the resolution of disapproval did not survive the president ’s veto , Congress could express its opposition by , for example , using its internal rules to block future spending on the conflict .
We believe our proposal is good for the presidency because it would eliminate a law that every president since Richard Nixon has treated as unconstitutional , while giving the president the political benefit of forcing Congress to take a position on going to war .
And it would do so without insisting that the president get the consent of Congress .
The statute is good for Congress because the legislative branch would get a more significant role when the nation decides whether to go to war .
Some may argue that Congress should have the dominant role in war powers debates .
But it has n’t played that role under the 1973 resolution .
Rather than endorse any absolutist position , our statute would give Congress access to intelligence , a full - time staff for studying national security issues and a well - defined mechanism for consulting and voting on significant armed conflicts .
Finally , the statute is good for the country because it would enhance the prospects for cooperation between Congress and the president .
It would ensure that the president received independent advice from Congress , and it would allow the people to hold Congress accountable for its role in the process .
When it comes to war , Americans deserve better than a law that is ineffective and ignored .
They deserve a law that will encourage future presidents and Congresses to work together to protect our nation .
We are all familiar with the Holocaust , known as the Shoah or the Hebrew word for calamity , and the unspeakable tragedies that occurred at concentration camps .
Unfortunately , there were other places filled with sorrow and grief that served as temporary deportation stations ; Drancy is one .
The Jews had lived quietly and unobtrusively in Paris up until the Vichy government replaced the Republic , and the systematic selection and categorization of Jews began .
Created by the government of Philippe Pétain and controlled by the French police , anti-semitic propaganda circulated freely .
Many of the French citizens were unduly influenced by the powerful Vichy regime , which persuaded them to accept Nazi control .
As early as October 1940 , a set of laws for the Jews in France to follow had already been established .
In effect , they were required to register with the local police , and by doing so , virtually lost their rights as citizens of France .
Jewish children over 6 years old were sent to school wearing the yellow six - pointed Star of David , as a mark of shame , to further identify and segregate them from the rest of the populace .
By August 20 , 1941 , massive citywide raids were rounding up thousands of these so - called “ undesirables , and housing soon became a problem .
A convenient solution was to include the low cost public housing project , La Cité de la Muette in the suburb of Drancy located about 4 miles from the center of Paris .
Although La Cité had not been fully developed , Drancy had been used as an internment camp as early as 1939 , and it was easy to incorporate the partially constructed buildings of La Cité as temporary housing From a public holding place for criminals , the Roma people , and other outcasts of society , Drancy now became an interim detention center , a barbed wire , heavily guarded camp managed by the French police and SS Captain Dannecker .
Full control of the camp was eventually turned over to Alois Brunner , the righthand man of Adolph Eichman , who served as the administrator from June 1943 until its liberation .
( Brunner , a recognized Nazi war criminal , was responsible for sending over 140,000 Jews to the gas chambers . )
At times , over 4,000 Jews were crowded into an area designed for only 700 people , where they were treated like animals , subject to the most inhumane brutality and substandard living conditions with little food and water .
Families were immediately separated , as long lines of women and men were loaded like cattle onto boxcars .
While convoy after convoy of human freight left Drancy for Auschwitz , children starved and died , and those left behind awaited an unknown fate and despaired of ever seeing their relatives again .
Some 40 prisoners , former members of the Resistance , failed in a desperate attempt to escape through a 115 - foot tunnel they had dug , which was soon discovered by the Nazis .
Of the 70,000 or more Jews who were brought here , it is estimated that only 2,000 managed to survive the nightmare of Drancy .
As Hitler ’s megalomania raged on , so did mass genocide and the size and frequency of these raids .
No Jew was exempt , and no distinction was made among the registered and non-registered , the commoner , or the prominent citizens of France such as Max Jacob , Tristan Bernard , and Rene Blum .
By far , the most infamous of these raids was the Grande Rafle du Vel ’ d’hiv when an estimated 13,000 Jews were rounded up on July 16 and 17 , 1942 , and herded into the Vélodrome , a large sports stadium .
From here , they were further categorized and sent to Drancy and other detention camps .
Perhaps the greatest tragedy of the Vel ’ d’hiv was in the number of children who were taken before their lives had hardly begun .
The age limit of 16 or over had been changed , and in less than three months ’ time , 6,000 or more children of all ages were collected and eventually put to death .
On occasion , a few young boys were handpicked from the camp and sent to schools and training as future Nazi soldiers .
The notorious SS Lieutenant Klaus Barbie , the “ Butcher of Lyon , ” sent over 300 young boys , ages 14 to 19 , which he had taken from a children ’s home , to Drancy and on to the gas chambers .
Fortunately , the insanity of Hitler ’s “ final solution ” ultimately failed , but not before at least 25 % of the Jewish population in France were virtually eliminated .
Some years after the war had ended , only a few attempts were made by the French government to make amends and recover from the overwhelming embarrassment of this deplorable time in the eyes of the world .
Even before WWII began , however , the French regime had offered refuge to those fleeing from Franco ’s Fascist Spain , but then later turned them over to the Nazis for extermination .
Although Petain and many others who were put on trial claimed no knowledge of these events and the persecution , it is hard to refute what history has told us .
In 1976 , a Polish Jew Shlomo Selinger designed an interesting statue consisting of 3 large blocks to be erected on Charles - de - Gaulle Esplanade .
There is considerable significance and reference to the Jewish religion and culture in the intricate details of his sculpture , including the letter Shen for Shaddai , the words used over doorways of Hebrew homes to signify God or the Guardian of Israel ’s Doors .
Ten figures in the center of the statue represent the gates of death , with 10 being the required number for religious prayer .
Two more at the top form the letters for Lamed and Vad , which combined represent the Lamedvavniks , the 36 who save the world from destruction .
Two sets of 7 steps , representing the degrees of Hell , lead to the “ path of martyrs ” and across the street to an old freight car that features an exhibition narrating the tragedy of deportation .
Years passed and still there was no apology from the French government until 1994 when former President Mitterand authorized the construction of a memorial to be sculpted by architect Azagury and Walter Spitzer , whose family had survived deportation .
In a special tribute to Vel ’ d’hiv , the statue features a sick man , a pregnant woman , and several children .
The words on the monument are worth noting : “ The French Republic in homage to victims of racist and anti-semitic persecutions and of crimes against humanity committed under the authority of the so - called ‘ Government of the State of France ’ . ”
Since 1995 when Chirac formally acknowledged the guilt of the French police and others who collaborated with the Nazis during the Occupation , the president of France has held a ceremony here each year .
Visitors to the former camp at Drancy will find only a small area of public housing , as much of the Vélodrome was destroyed by fire in 1959 , and what remained was demolished .
In May 2001 , the Minister of Culture , Catherine Tasca designated La Cité de la Muette as a national monument , which houses a small conservatory of documents , a few memorial plaques including one to Max Jacob , and three more collectively dedicated to 100,000 Jews and other French and British soldiers held at Drancy .
Further tributes to Holocaust victims in France can be seen in the Wall of Names , dedicated in 2005 , which is located at the entrance of the Shoah Memorial in Paris .
The stone wall is engraved with the names of 76,000 Jews who were deported to Nazi concentration camps from 1942 – 1944 , and of these , over 11,000 were children .
The Memorial serves as the Centre for Jewish Contemporary Documentation , and is dedicated to the Unknown Jewish Martyr , with a crypt in the basement that holds ashes of only a few who died in the death camps .
Within the Memorial , small family photographs and drawings made by the children are the saddest part , perhaps , of it all .
These are the faces of children who were victims of terror and the tragedies of war , faced with the unimaginable loss of parents and family , and the horrors of punishment and death .
Surrounded by circumstances beyond their control , many too young to understand , they lived in fear of what lay ahead .
For the few who did manage to survive , their lives would never be the same .

Two related findings that surely signal a major new direction in the study of Alzheimer ’s disease ( AD ) :
Two means of controlling intracellular calcium homeostasis appears to play a major role in controlling levels of the Aß protein , a major component of the senile plaques that characterize AD and ( thusly ) a likely source of AD - associated cell death .
Specifically , deficiencies in two distinct calcium pumps appear to promote molecular events associated with AD pathology .
Green et al. report that SERCA , which pumps excess Ca2 + into the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) or its muscle equivalent , the sarcoplasmic reticulum ( SR ) , has diminished activity in cells lacking presenilin - 1 and presenilin - 2 ( PS1 / PS2 deficiencies are associated at the cellular level with increased production of the proteotoxic peptide Aß 1 - 42 , and at the organismal level with increased risk of early - onset AD ) .
Critically , modulation of SERCA activity on its own can affect the rate of Aß synthesis .
Taken together , the data argue that PS1 / PS2 regulate intracellular Ca2+ , and that calcium in turn influences production of Aß ( and thereby the risk and progression of AD ) .
Meanwhile , Dreses - Werringloer et al. have identified CALHM1 , a calcium pump on the plasma membrane ( as opposed to the ER / SR membrane ) that is also involved in Aß production .
A naturally occurring polymorphism in the CALHM1 gene is strongly associated with AD ; the authors propose that the mutation interferes with Ca2 + permeability and that this alters
Aß expression via an as - yet - undetermined mechanism .
The two stories are similar , but the attentive reader will notice a curious feature :
The calcium is moving in opposite directions .
SERCA pumps Ca2 + out of the cytosol into the ER / SR , so a deficiency in SERCA would increase cytosolic Ca2 + ( and , incidentally , the ratio of cytosolic vs. ER / SR Ca2 + ) .
In contrast , CALHM1 pumps Ca2 + into the cytosol , so that a deficiency in that protein would decrease cytosolic Ca2 + .
But deficiencies in either gene promote AD ( or at least AD - related molecular pathology ) .
What gives ?
It ’s possible that the ( similar ) effects on Aß levels are mediated by totally different mechanisms , but I ’m more enticed by another idea .
Suppose that ER / SR Ca2 + levels are key to Aß production , with decreased ER / SR calcium reserves associated with either higher Aß expression or greater production / secretion of Aß 1 - 42 in particular .
In both mutants , ER / SR calcium reserves would be depleted :
In the case of SERCA , because there ’s no pump transferring cytosolic Ca2 + into the ER / SR , but in the case of CALHM1 , because there ’s no pump transferring extracellularCa2 + into the cytosol , whence it could be subsequently pumped into the ER / SR .
Aß is after all a secreted protein , so the ion concentrations in the compartments of the secretory pathway could conceivably be crucial to the production of amyloid protein .

Introduction
Back in year 2004 I had to choose a thesis topic as a prerequisite of completion of my undergraduate course in Computer Science and Engineering .
I had choosen Process Migration .
And our teacher Mahmud Shahriar Hossain agreed to supervise my work .
My partner was Md. Helal Uddin .
As part of the thesis I had to implement a Java Virtual Machine .
I wanted to write an article since then .
But it never actually happened .
Today ( March 2 ) is my birth day and I want to start it .
The virtual machine is also used in my new project Morpheus - a prototype of Silverlight 1.1 .
The seminar presentation downloadable from above link shows how a JVM works .
You may also look at the JVM source code from above link .
Please note that most the implementation decision taken may not match with other commercially available JVM implementation .
Whenever JVM Spec is found to say nothing , the most easiest approach is taken to save time .
Java Virtual Machine Parts
Class File Structure
The java virtual machine needs an application that is made up of collection of java classes .
At the beginning of any class there is a defined structure like JavaClassFileFormat .
struct JavaClassFileFormat { u4 magic ; u2 minor_version ; u2 major_version ; u2 constant_pool_count ; cp_info **constant_pool ; //[constant_pool_count -1 ] ; u2 access_flags ; u2 this_class ; u2 super_class ; u2 interfaces_count ; u2 * interfaces ; //[interfaces_count ] ; u2 fields_count ; field_info_ex * fields ; //[fields_count ] ; u2 methods_count ; method_info_ex * methods ; //[methods_count ] ; u2 attributes_count ; attribute_info** attributes ; //[attributes_count ] ; } ;
Following are the structures used in the format .
They represents constant pool ( constant values used in class files ) , fields , methods and attributes in a class file .
I 'll describe them in details later .
struct cp_info { u1 tag ; u1 * info ; } ; struct field_info { u2 access_flags ; u2 name_index ; u2 descriptor_index ; u2 attributes_count ; attribute_info * attributes ; //[attributes_count ] ; } ; struct method_info { u2 access_flags ; u2 name_index ; u2 descriptor_index ; u2 attributes_count ; attribute_info * attributes ; //[attributes_count ] ; } ; struct attribute_info { u2 attribute_name_index ; u4 attribute_length ; u1 * info;//[attribute_length ] ; } ;
We first load the class file in memory as raw byte and then use JavaClass object to parse the raw bytes and identify the fields , methods , exception table etc .
The JavaClass class represent a class in memory in structured form .
It holds a pointer to the raw byte stream that was loaded from class file .
Java Class in Memory
JavaClassFileFormat
JavaClassFileFormat
class JavaClass : public JavaClassFileFormat { public : JavaClass ( void ) ; virtual ~ JavaClass ( void ) ; public : virtual BOOL LoadClassFromFile( CString lpszFilePath ) ; void SetByteCode( void* pByteCode ) ; BOOL ParseClass ( void ) ; BOOL ParseInterfaces ( char * &p ) ; BOOL ParseFields ( char * &p ) ; BOOL ParseMethods ( char * &p ) ; BOOL ParseAttributes ( char* &p ) ; BOOL GetConstantPool ( u2 n Index , cp_info& const_pool ) ; BOOL GetStringFromConstPool ( int n Index , CString& strValue ) ; CString GetName ( void ) ; CString GetSuperClassName( void ) ; BOOL ParseMethodCodeAttribute ( int n MethodIndex , Code_attribute * pCode_attr ) ; int GetMethodIndex ( CString strMethodName , CString strMethodDesc , JavaClass * & pClass ) ; int GetFieldIndex ( CString strName , CString& strDesc ) ; void SetClassHeap ( ClassHeap * pClassHeap ) {this->m_pClassHeap=pClassHeap;} virtual u4 GetObjectSize ( void ) ; virtual u4 GetObjectFieldCount( void ) ; JavaClass * GetSuperClass ( void ) ; BOOL CreateObject ( u2 index , ObjectHeap * pObjectHeap , Object& object ) ; BOOL CreateObjectArray ( u2 index, u4 count , ObjectHeap * pObjectHeap , Object& object ) ; private : size_t m_nByteCodeLength ; void * m_pByteCode ; u2 m_nObjectFieldsCount ; BOOL ParseConstantPool ( char* &p ) ; int GetConstantPoolSize( char* p ) ; ClassHeap *m_pClassHeap ; } ;
Here we just inherit thefor simplicity of storing the values in in memory class representation .
We must parse the raw class file in memory to get the values forfields .
To do that we first load the file in memory and then call the ParseClass method which is shown in the next section .
Class Loader
As there are some variable length fields it is not possible to directly load the structure .
So we load the values one by one .
First we load the value of magic which is an unsigned integer ( u4 ) value .
It must be value of 0xCafeBabe .
If it is not the class file may be either corrupted or not a java class file at all .
Then we load other values and structures .
To load structures we first load the count and then load the structure .
For example first we load short ( u2 ) value constant_pool_count and then load that number of constant pool .
To parse I used definitions getu4 ( p ) or similar which just picks 4 bytes starting at p and returns the unsigned int value .
To parse structures hare use sepaate methods like ParseConstantPool .
It takes the reference of the byte stream pointer and increments in that class .
I did this only for simplicity .
It would be more readable if I 'd return the total length and increent in ParseClass method but that would me less managable .
BOOL JavaClass :: ParseClass ( void ) { // just to be safe if ( m_pByteCode==NULL
|| m_nByteCodeLength < sizeof ( JavaClassFileFormat ) +20 ) return FALSE ; char * p= ( char *)m_pByteCode ; magic = getu4( p ) ; p+=4 ; ASSERT ( magic == 0xCAFEBABE ) ; if ( magic != 0xCAFEBABE ) return FALSE ; minor_version=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; major_version=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; constant_pool_count=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; if ( constant_pool_count>0 ) ParseConstantPool ( p ) ; access_flags=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; this_class=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; super_class=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; interfaces_count=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; if ( interfaces_count>0 ) ParseInterfaces ( p ) ; fields_count=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; if ( fields_count > 0 ) ParseFields ( p ) ; methods_count = getu2(p ) ;p+=2 ; if ( methods_count >
0 ) { ParseMethods ( p ) ; } attributes_count = getu2(p ) ; p+=2 ; if ( attributes_count > 0 ) ParseAttributes ( p ) ; return 0 ; }
Constant Pool
In a java class several constant value is stored .
It stores numeric , string and reference values in a pool and those are used in machine codes known as ' Java Byte Code ' .
Constant pool contains constant_pool_count items in a sequential list of following structure .
struct cp_info { u1 tag ; u1 * info ; } ;
Constant pool information structure starts with one byte of tag information that indicates the type of the constant pool .
Constant pool structure length is variable depending on the type of constant .
Constant pool tag value can be one of the following values depending on the type of constant .
# define CONSTANT_Integer 3 #define CONSTANT_Float 4 #define CONSTANT_Long 5 #define CONSTANT_Double 6 #define CONSTANT_Utf8 1 #define CONSTANT_String 8 #define CONSTANT_Class 7 #define CONSTANT_Fieldref 9 #define CONSTANT_Methodref 10 #define CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref 11 #define CONSTANT_NameAndType 12
Depending on the value of tag we can cast the cp_info structure in more precise structures listed here .
CONSTANT_Integer_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_Integer in cp_info structure then it is an integer constant .
We can cast the cp_info structure in following structure .
struct CONSTANT_Integer_info { u1 tag ; u4 bytes ; } ;
This structure does not have any reference to any other constant .
It represents direct 4 byte integer value .
CONSTANT_Float_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_Float in cp_info structure then it is a float constant .

It is a direct value constant without any reference .
It uses two four bute values to construct the 8 byte long value .
CONSTANT_Long_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_Double in cp_info structure then it is a double constant .
We can cast the cp_info structure in following structure .
struct CONSTANT_Double_info { u1 tag ; u4 high_bytes ; u4 low_bytes ; } ;
It is a direct value constant without any reference .
It uses two four bute values to construct the 8 byte double value .
CONSTANT_Utf8_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_Utf8 in cp_info structure then it is a utf8 string constant .
We can cast the cp_info structure in following structure .
struct CONSTANT_Utf8 _info { u1 tag ; u2 length ; u1 * bytes ;//[ length ] ; } ;
It is a direct value constant without any reference .
The short value length defines the length of the byte array followed by length number of bytes .
CONSTANT_String_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_String in cp_info structure then it is a string reference constant .
We can cast the cp_info structure in following structure .
struct CONSTANT_String_info { u1 tag ; u2 string_index ; } ;
It is a reference value constant .
The short value string_index refers to a CONSTANT_Utf8 _info index in the constant pool .
CONSTANT_Class_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_Class in cp_info structure then it is a class reference constant .
We can cast the cp_info structure in following structure .
struct CONSTANT_Class_info { u1 tag ; u2 name_index ; } ;
It is a reference value constant .
The short value name_index refers to a CONSTANT_Utf8 _info index in the constant pool that is the fully qualified name ( ie java / lang / String ) of the class - dot replaced by slash .
CONSTANT_Fieldref_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_Fieldref in cp_info structure then it is a field reference constant .
We can cast the cp_info structure in following structure .
struct CONSTANT_Fieldref_info { u1 tag ; u2 class_index ; u2 name_and_type_index ; } ;
It is a reference value constant .
The short value class_index refers to a CONSTANT_Class_info index in the constant pool and name_and_type_index refers to a string index in the constant pool that is the fully qualified name ( ie java / lang / String@valueOf ( F ) Ljava / lang / String ; ) of the class - dot replaced by slash .
CONSTANT_Methodref_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_Methodref in cp_info structure then it is a method reference constant .
We can cast the cp_info structure in following structure .
struct CONSTANT_Methodref_info { u1 tag ; u2 class_index ; u2 name_and_type_index ; } ;
It is a reference value constant .
The short value class_index refers to a CONSTANT_Class_info index in the constant pool and name_and_type_index refers to a string index in the constant pool that is the fully qualified name ( ie java / lang / String@valueOf ( F ) Ljava / lang / String ; ) of the class - dot replaced by slash .
CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref in cp_info structure then it is an interface method reference constant .
We can cast the cp_info structure in following structure .
struct CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref_info { u1 tag ; u2 class_index ; u2 name_and_type_index ; } ;
It is a reference value constant .
The short value class_index refers to a CONSTANT_Class_info index in the constant pool and name_and_type_index refers to a string index in the constant pool that is the fully qualified name ( ie java / lang / String@valueOf ( F ) Ljava / lang / String ; ) of the class - dot replaced by slash .
CONSTANT_NameAndType_info
If tag value equals CONSTANT_NameAndType in cp_info structure then it is an interface method reference constant .
We can cast the cp_info structure in following structure .
struct CONSTANT_NameAndType_info { u1 tag ; u2 name_index ; u2 descriptor_index ; } ;
It is a reference value constant .
The short value name_index refers to a string index in the constant pool and descriptor_index refers to another string index in the constant pool .
Parsing constant pool
Here we set the values of constant pool list pointers .
When we need to retrieve the actual value we look at the tag and pick the value directly .
BOOL JavaClass :: ParseConstantPool ( char* &p ) { constant_pool = new cp_info*[ constant_pool_count -1 ] ; if ( constant_pool == NULL ) return FALSE ; for ( int i=1 ;i< constant_pool_count ;i++ )
{ // We set the constant pointer here constant_pool [ i] =( cp_info * ) p ; // We now calculate constant size .
If it is an integer we get size = 5 int size = GetConstantPoolSize( p ) ; p+= size ; //
If constant type is long or double constant pool takes two entries .
//
Second entry is not used by virtual machine but kept NULL to walk // constant pool correctly .
if( constant_pool [i]->tag == CONSTANT_Long || constant_pool [i]-> tag == CONSTANT_Double ) { constant_pool [ i+1 ] =NULL ; i++ ; } } return TRUE ; }
Interfaces
In the interfaces field of a class there are interfaces_count number of short ( u2 ) values .
Each value is a reference to a constant pool entry of type CONSTANT_Class .
We parse them and store in our in - memory object -
BOOL JavaClass :: ParseInterfaces ( char* &p ) { interfaces = new u2 [ interfaces_count ] ; for ( int i=0 ; i< interfaces_count ;i++ ) { interfaces [ i ] = getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; } return TRUE ; }
Fields
A class may contain zero , one or more fields .
The actual number is stored in the fields_count field .
A list of field _info structure followes this value .
struct field_info { u2 access_flags ; u2 name_index ; u2 descriptor_index ; u2 attributes_count ; attribute_info * attributes ;//[attributes_count ] ; } ;
The short value access_flags describes the allowed field access .
Here is the possible access flags values which is shared also by methods and classes -
# define ACC_PUBLIC
0x0001 /*Declared public ; may be accessed from outside its package .
*/ #define ACC_PRIVATE
0x0002 /*Declared private ; accessible only within the defining class .
*/ #define ACC_PROTECTED
0x0004 /*Declared protected ; may be accessed within subclasses .
*/ #define ACC_STATIC
0x0008 /*Declared static . */ #define ACC_FINAL
0x0010 /*Declared final ; may not be overridden .
*/ #define ACC_SYNCHRONIZED
0x0020 /*Declared synchronized ; invocation is wrapped in a monitor lock .
*/ #define ACC_NATIVE
0x0100 /*Declared native ; implemented in a language other than Java .
*/ #define ACC_ABSTRACT
0x0400 /*Declared abstract ; no implementation is provided .
*/ #define ACC_STRICT
0x0800 /*Declared strictfp ; floating - point mode is FP - strict */
The name_index and descriptor_index are reference to two constant pool of type utf8 string .
The attributes field defined the attributes of the field .
Attributes are described later .
Here is how we parse fields in a class 's raw bytes -
BOOL JavaClass :: ParseFields ( char* &p ) { fields = new field_info_ex [ fields_count ] ; if ( fields == NULL ) return FALSE ; for ( int i=0 ; i< fields_count ;i++ ) { fields [ i].pFieldInfoBase = ( field_info * ) p ; fields[i].access_flags= getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; //access_flags fields[i].name_index= getu2(p ) ;p+=2 ; // fields[i].descriptor_index= getu2(p ) ;p+=2 ; // fields[i].attributes_count=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; if ( fields[i].attributes_count >0 ) { // skip attributes - we do not need in simple cases for ( int a=0 ; a< fields[i].attributes_count ;a++ ) { u2 name_index=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; // printf ( " Attribute name index = %d
" , name_index ) ; u4 len=getu4 ( p ) ; p+=4 ; p+=len ; } } } return TRUE ; }
Methods
A java class file may contain arbitrary number of methods .
The count is stored in methods_count member of class file structure .
As it is a two byte field the theoritical upper limit is essentially 2^16 .
Like fields info , method info structure contains access flags , name index , descriptor index , and attributes .
struct method_info { u2 access_flags ; u2 name_index ; u2 descriptor_index ; u2 attributes_count ; attribute_info * attributes ;//[attributes_count ] ; } ;
Method body ( if any ) is stored in an attribute named Code - which contains the actual ' Java Byte Code ' .
Here is how we parse methods in out virtual machine -
//TODO : Cashe the findings here BOOL JavaClass :: ParseMethods ( char* &p ) { methods = new method_info_ex[ methods_count ] ; if ( methods == NULL ) return FALSE ; for ( int i=0 ; i< methods_count ;i++ ) { //methods [i ] = new method_info_ex ; methods[i].pMethodInfoBase=( method_info*) p ; methods[i].access_flags= getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; //access_flags methods[i].name_index = getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; //name_index methods[i].descriptor_index= getu2(p ) ; p+=2 ; //descriptor_index methods[i].attributes_count=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; CString strName , strDesc ; GetStringFromConstPool( methods[i].name_index , strName ) ; GetStringFromConstPool( methods[i].descriptor_index , strDesc ) ; TRACE ( _T ( " Method = %s%s
" ) , strName , strDesc ) ; TRACE ( " Method has total %d attributes
" , methods[i].attributes_count ) ; methods[i].pCode_attr=NULL ; if ( methods[i].attributes_count >0 ) { // skip attributes for ( int a=0 ; a< methods[i].attributes_count ;a++ ) { u2 name_index=getu2( p ) ; p+=2 ; TRACE ( " Attribute name index = %d
" , name_index ) ; u4 len=getu4 ( p ) ; p+=4 ; p+=len ; } methods [ i ] .
pCode_attr = new Code_attribute ; ParseMethodCodeAttribute( i , methods [ i ]. pCode_attr ) ; } } return TRUE ; }
In case of method structure ( and also same in fields structure ) I have used method_info_ex instead of method_info structure .
This extended structure on pointer to pint to raw method info in the in -memory bytestream of class file .
Here with other fields we parse the Code attribute .
The details id given later in attributes section .
Attributes
In most classes attributes takes most of the space in file .
Class has attributes , method has attributes , field has attributes .
The raw definition of attribute is like this -
struct attribute_info { u2 attribute_name_index ; u4 attribute_length ; u1 * info;//[attribute_length ] ; } ;
The attribute_name_index field is the reference index in the constant pool for string type constant .
The attribute_length field is the length of info field - which is another structure depending on the type / name of the attribute .
An arrtibute can be a constant value , exception table or code type .
Constant value attribute
struct ConstantValue_attribute { u2 attribute_name_index ; u4 attribute_length ; u2 constantvalue_index ; } ;
Code Attribute
It is also a method specific attribute .
The name of the attribute is hardcoded as ' Code ' .
This attribute has maximum stack and maximum local values of the method .
The code field is variable length defined by code_length and it contains the actual ' Java Byte Code ' .
struct Code_attribute { u2 attribute_name_index ; u4 attribute_length ; u2 max_stack ; u2 max_locals ; u4 code_length ; u1 * code;//[code_length ] ; u2 exception_table_length ; Exception_table * exception_table;//[exception_table_length ] ; u2 attributes_count ; attribute_info * attributes;//[attributes_count ] ; } ;
Exception table structure
This structure is used to define the exception table for methods .
The exception table describes the exception handler depending on the program counter value or offset of byte code .
The handler code is also an offset in the byte code .
struct Exception_table { u2 start_pc ; u2 end_pc ; u2 handler_pc ; u2 catch_type ; } ;
The field catch_type is a reference to a constant pool entry that describes the type of the exception - for example reference to a class named ' java/lang / Exception ' .
Java Instruction
Set
Java has more than 200 instructions .
The java language file , when compiled , is converted to a class file that contains intrtuctions as byte codes .
If we have a method like this -
public int mul( int a , int b ) { return a * b ; }
we will get this method in byte code attribute like this - ( java has also assembly like representation for instructions to represent byte codes in human readable format )
Code Attribute : Stack=2 , Locals=3 , Args_size=3 , Code Length = 4 Code : 0 : iload_1 1 : iload_2 2 : imul 3 : ireturn
Here if we follow the instructions we go like this :
0 : Push ( load ) the local variable 1 on stack 1 : Push the local variable 2 on stack 3 : Pop two values from stack , do an integer multipucation and push the result 4 : Return the integer value from stack top .
What we need to do in our virtual machine is load classes and follow the instructions in methods .
There are methods to create new objects , to call methods of object .
It is also possible to call native methods from a java method .
Please refer to source code for most other codes ( opcodes.h ) or Java Virtual Machine Specification for a complete list .
Class heap
In the virtual machine we must maintain a heap where the class definition objects can be stored .
I have implemented it as a separate heap for simplity .
In this heap we load classes from files and store it in the heap .
The ClassHeap class is responsible for maintaining the class heap in meory .
class ClassHeap { CMapStringToPtr m_ClassMap ; FilePathManager * pFilePathManager ; public : ClassHeap ( void ) ; public : virtual ~ ClassHeap ( void ) ; public : BOOL AddClass ( JavaClass * pJavaClass ) ; JavaClass * GetClass ( CString strClassName ) ; BOOL LoadClass ( CString strClassName , JavaClass * pClass ) ; } ;
We store JavaClass objects pointer in the m_ClassMap member using the class name as key .
Object heap
Object heap is virtual machine 's RAM .
All objects are created on object heap and its reference can be stored in another object or on the stack .
Any reference is stored in an union type storage named Variable .
Any field of a class can be represented using variable object .
Anything can be stored in a Variable object .
union Variable { u1 charValue ; u2 shortValue ; u4 intValue ; f4 floatValue ; LONG_PTR ptrValue ; Object object ; } ;
Object creation on heap is described later in detail .
Virtual Machine Stack
Java instruction set is designed in such a way that it can work with very limited set of registers .
Instead it uses its stack very extensively .
The JVM stack element is one item regardless of - it may be primitive ype or object type .
Only long and double type takes two stack spaces .
The ' Execution Engine ' maintains the JVM stack .
For example when the execution engine executes iadd instruction it pops two numeric values from the stack and add the values and pushes the result on the stack .
The virtual machine has empty stack initially and the stack is populated after the initial thread and the initial method is started for execution .
Each method instruction is allowed to operate on stack within a limited boundary of the stack .
The compiler sets the upper limit ( top ) as max_stack field of each methods Code attribute .
The lower limit is the top +1 stack position of previous method .
This boundary of stack is named as Stack Frame of that method .
The Stack Frame
As we mentioned each methods boundary in the JVM stack is known as ' Stack Frame ' .
Each stack frame reserves positions for the parameters and local variables of that method .
If it is not a static method the first parameter is the object reference ( the this parameter ) of type of the class of the method .
The Execution Engine operates between the frame and when the method returns a value it pops every element from the current frame including this reference and pushes the return value ( if method is not void return type ) value on the frame of previous frames top .
To keep the implementation simple I used slightly different methodology .
I used stack of stack .
Each frame is stack type and it is pushed on the JVM stack .
The stack grows on method invocation and shrinks on method return .
Local Variables
In a stack frame local variables takes positions from zero to max_locals - 1 positions or less .
If the method is not static the object takes the position zero and other locals follow it .
Local variables are accessed using putfield and getfield instructions .
Native method stack
Unlike virtual machine stack , native methods stack is not maintained by JVM .
It is maintained by the native system .
Actually while a native method is being executed the virtual machine component that was managing the java thread waits until the native method completes and returns .
Runtime Environment
Each java thread has its own frame stack .
All java threads in a process share common class heap and object heap .
This things are bundled together in a RuntimeEnvironment object and carried among the execution engine components .
class RuntimeEnvironment { public : Frame * pFrameStack ; ClassHeap * pClassHeap ; ObjectHeap * pObjectHeap ; } ;
Execution Unit
This is the main module of the JVM .
It interprates the instructons .
Advanced JVMs may use JIT compiler to convert java instructions into native instruction .
But I did not do that because of the complexity of the JIT compiler .
When a JVM starts it usually takes initial class name as parameter .
Our JVM also takes class name as a parameter .
The class heap is then requested to load that class .
Then the JVM finds its main method ( it can be any name like Entry in case of my first implementation ) , creates the initial stack frame and requests the execution engine to start execution .
The heart of the Execution Unit is the Execute method .
Here is the skeleton :
u4 ExecutionEngine :: Execute ( Frame * pFrameStack ) { ASSERT ( pFrameStack ) ; ASSERT ( pFrame ) ; Frame * pFrame=&pFrameStack[0 ] ; DbgPrint ( _T ( " Current Frame %ld Stack start at %ld
" ) , pFrame - Frame : : pBaseFrame , pFrame -> stack - Frame :: pOpStack ) ; if ( pFrame -> pMethod->access_flags & ACC_NATIVE ) { ExecuteNativeMethod( pFrame ) ; return 0 ; } u1 * bc=pFrame -> pMethod-> pCode_attr->code + pFrame -> pc ; i4 error=0 ; JavaClass * pClass = pFrame -> pClass ; CString strMethod ; pClass->GetStringFromConstPool( pFrame->pMethod->name_index , strMethod ) ; DbgPrint ( _T( " Execute At Class %s Method %s
" ) , pClass -> GetName ( ) , strMethod ) ; i4 index=0 ; i8 longVal ; while ( 1 ) { switch ( bc [ pFrame -> pc ] ) { case nop : // Do nothing pFrame -> pc++ ; break ; // Integer Arithmetic case iadd : //96 : Pop two int values from stack add them and push result pFrame -> stack [ pFrame->sp-1].intValue=pFrame->stack[ pFrame->sp-1].intValue + pFrame -> stack[ pFrame->sp].intValue ; pFrame->sp--; pFrame -> pc++ ; break ; // Method return instructions case ireturn : //172 ( 0xac ) :
Pop everything from stack and push return value ( int ) pFrame -> stack[0].intValue=pFrame->stack[ pFrame->sp].intValue ; return ireturn ; // here we break the while loop break ; // Method invokation Instructions //
Here actually we do a recursive call to Execute // to keep things simple - after the java method return we // also return from Execute - some memory waste for simplicity case invokevirtual : //182 : Invoke a virtual method .
//
The object reference and parameters are on stack by java instructions ExecuteInvoke ( pFrame , invokevirtual ) ; pFrame -> pc+=3 ; break ; } //Instructions that deal with objects case _new :// 187 ( 0x bb ) ExecuteNew ( pFrame ) ; pFrame -> pc+=3 ; break ; case putfield : //181 ( 0xb5 ) : Set field in object from stack top PutField ( pFrame ) ; pFrame ->sp -=2 ; pFrame -> pc+=3 ; break ; case getfield : //180 ( 0xb4 )
Fetch field from object and push on stack GetField ( pFrame ) ; pFrame -> pc+=3 ; break ; } return 0 ; }
Creating object on Object Heap
An object is usually created by JVM when a new or newarray or multinewarray instruction is executed .
When a virtual machine creates an object it first calculate the size of the object .
To calculate the object size we we first take the fields_count value in the class structure then we add its super classes fields_count value with it then we add super classes super classes fields_count and so on recursively until we reach the final base class java.lang .
Object .
This way we calculate total fields of the object and add one with it that holds the class pointer in the ClassHeap .
Now we multiply the sizeof ( Variable ) to the count and get number of bytes required for the object .
We now allocate the required bytes and return the pointer to that memory in a Variable object on the stack top .
Here is the implementation .
int ExecutionEngine :: ExecuteNew ( Frame* p Frame ) { pFrame ->sp++ ; u1 * bc=pFrame -> pMethod->pCode_attr->code ; u2 index=getu2(&bc[ pFrame->pc+1 ] ) ; if (!
pFrame -> pClass->CreateObject ( index , this -> pObjectHeap , pFrame -> stack [ pFrame->sp].object ) ) return - 1 ; return 0 ; } BOOL JavaClass :: CreateObject ( u2 index , ObjectHeap * pObjectHeap , Object& object ) { char * cp=( char *) this->constant_pool [ index ] ; ASSERT ( cp [ 0 ] == CONSTANT_Class ) ; ASSERT ( pObjectHeap ) ; if ( cp [ 0 ] != CONSTANT_Class ) return FALSE ; u2 name_index=getu2( &cp[ 1 ] ) ; CString strClassName ; if (!
this->GetStringFromConstPool(name_index , strClassName ) ) return FALSE ; JavaClass * pNewClass=this->m_pClassHeap->GetClass(strClassName ) ; if ( pNewClass == NULL ) return FALSE ; object=pObjectHeap->CreateObject( pNewClass ) ; return TRUE ; }
Setting or getting value in object
The putfield instruction is used to set a value ( from stack ) of a field and the getfield instruction is used to load a variables value on the stack .
When the execution engine needs to execute a getfield instruction it pops two values from the stack .
One value is the object pointer another is field position ( zero based index ) .
Here is my implementation :
// Gets value or reference from stack and set in object void ExecutionEngine : : PutField ( Frame * pFrameStack ) { u2 n Index = getu2 ( & pFrameStack [0 ] .
pMethod->pCode_attr->code[pFrameStack[0 ].pc+1 ] ) ; Variable obj=pFrameStack[0].stack[pFrameStack[0 ].sp -1 ] ; Variable value=pFrameStack[0].stack[pFrameStack[0].sp ] ; Variable * pVarList=this->pObjectHeap->GetObjectPointer(obj.object ) ; pVarList [ nIndex+1 ] =value ; } //Gets the value from variable and push on stack void ExecutionEngine : : GetField ( Frame * p Frame ) { // TODO : Bug check for long and double u2 n Index = getu2 ( & pFrame -> pMethod->pCode_attr->code[ pFrame->pc+1 ] ) ; Variable obj=pFrame->stack [ pFrame->sp ] ; Variable * pVarList=this->pObjectHeap->GetObjectPointer(obj.object ) ; pFrame -> stack [ pFrame->sp]=pVarList[nIndex+1 ] ; }
Invoking method
When execution engine requires a method invocation it needs to creates a new ' Stack Frame ' and the pc or Program Counter is set to the first byte of the methods byte code .
Before that , the execution engine must save the current methods pc so that it can come back to resume method execution after the callee method returns .
Here is our implementation .
Please note how we handle static method invocation - simply we do not have the this reference on our stack .
void ExecutionEngine :: ExecuteInvoke( Frame * pFrameStack , u2 type ) { u2 mi=getu2 ( & pFrameStack [0 ] .
pMethod->pCode_attr->code[pFrameStack[0 ].pc+1 ] ) ; Variable objectRef = pFrameStack[0].stack[pFrameStack[0].sp ] ; char * pConstPool = ( char *) pFrameStack [ 0 ] .
pClass->constant_pool[mi ] ; ASSERT ( pConstPool [ 0 ] == CONSTANT_Methodref ) ; u2 classIndex = getu2(&pConstPool [ 1 ] ) ; u2 nameAndTypeIndex = getu2(&pConstPool [ 3 ] ) ; // get class at pool index pConstPool = ( char *) pFrameStack [ 0 ] .
pClass->constant_pool[classIndex ] ; ASSERT ( pConstPool [ 0 ] == CONSTANT_Class ) ; u2 ni=getu2(&pConstPool [ 1 ] ) ; CString strClassName ; pFrameStack [ 0 ] .
pClass->GetStringFromConstPool ( ni , strClassName ) ; JavaClass * pClass=pClassHeap->GetClass( strClassName ) ; pConstPool = ( char *) pFrameStack [ 0 ] .
pClass->constant_pool[nameAndTypeIndex ] ; ASSERT ( pConstPool [ 0 ] == CONSTANT_NameAndType ) ; method_info_ex method ; method.name_index = getu2(&pConstPool [ 1 ] ) ; method.descriptor_index = getu2(&pConstPool [ 3 ] ) ; method.access_flags = 0 ; // set later CString strName , strDesc ; pFrameStack [ 0 ] .
pClass->GetStringFromConstPool ( method.name_index , strName ) ; pFrameStack [ 0 ] .
pClass->GetStringFromConstPool ( method.descriptor_index , strDesc ) ; JavaClass * pVirtualClass=pClass ; int nIndex=pClass->GetMethodIndex(strName , strDesc , pVirtualClass ) ; memset ( &pFrameStack [ 1],0 , sizeof( pFrameStack [ 1 ] ) ) ; pFrameStack [ 1 ] .
pMethod = & pClass -> methods [ nIndex ] ; method.access_flags = getu2(( char *) pFrameStack [ 1 ] .
pMethod ) ; if ( ACC_SUPER & method.access_flags ) { pFrameStack [ 1 ] .
pClass = pVirtualClass->GetSuperClass ( ) ; } else { pFrameStack [ 1 ] .pClass=pVirtualClass ; } int params=GetMethodParametersStackCount(strDesc)+1 ; //invokestatic - there is no this pointer if ( type==invokestatic ) params --; // else invokevirtual has this pointer int nDiscardStack =params ; if ( pFrameStack [ 1 ] .
pMethod->access_flags & ACC_NATIVE ) { } else { n DiscardStack+=pFrameStack [ 1 ] .
pMethod->pCode_attr->max_locals ; } pFrameStack [ 1 ] . stack = & Frame :: pOpStack [ pFrameStack -> stack - Frame:: pOpStack+pFrameStack[0].sp-params+1 ] ; pFrameStack [ 1].sp=nDiscardStack -1 ; this -> Execute( & pFrameStack [ 1 ] ) ; // if returns then get on stack if ( strDesc. Find( _T ( " ) V " ) ) < 0 ) { nDiscardStack --; } //Before we return to caller make the stack of caller right pFrameStack[0].sp-=nDiscardStack ; }
Invoking native method
In a java class a method may be marked as native -
public class Test { public native void Print ( string message ) ; }
In byte code ACC_NATIVE is set in the access_flags field of the method_info structure .
We decide here like this :
if( pFrame-> pMethod->access_flags & ACC_NATIVE ) { ExecuteNativeMethod( pFrame ) ; return 0 ; }
Each native method usually has a fixed predefined prototype .
Here is the type definitation for our JVM :
typedef Variable ( * pNativeMethod ) ( RuntimeEnvironment * pRuntimeEnvironment ) ;
Here is how we handle native methods in the JVM :
u4 ExecutionEngine ::ExecuteNativeMethod( Frame * pFrameStack ) { ASSERT ( pFrameStack ) ; ASSERT ( pFrame -> pMethod->access_flags & ACC_NATIVE ) ; Frame * pFrame=&pFrameStack[0 ] ; JavaClass * pClass = pFrame -> pClass ; CString strClassName , strMethod , strDesc , strSignature ; strClassName=pClass->GetName( ) ; pClass->GetStringFromConstPool ( pFrame -> pMethod-> name_index , strMethod ) ; pClass->GetStringFromConstPool ( pFrame -> pMethod->descriptor_index , strDesc ) ; DbgPrint ( _T( " Execute At Class %s Method %s%s
" ) , strClassName , strMethod , strDesc ) ; strSignature=strClassName+_T( " @ " ) +strMethod+strDesc ; pNativeMethod pNativeMethod=GetNativeMethod(strSignature ) ; RuntimeEnvironment rte ; rte.pFrameStack=pFrameStack ; rte.pClassHeap= pClassHeap ; rte.pObjectHeap= pObjectHeap ; if ( pNativeMethod == NULL ) { // what should I do here ?? // System Panic ?? ASSERT ( FALSE ) ; return - 1 ; } else { // Here we go native Variable retVal = pNativeMethod ( &rte ) ; //if returns then get on stack if ( strDesc. Find( _T ( " ) V " ) ) < 0 ) { pFrame -> stack [ 0 ] =retVal ; } } return 0 ; }
Print
//Signature : _T (" Test@Print ( Ljava/lang / String ; ) V " ) Variable Print( RuntimeEnvironment * pRuntimeEnvironment ) { Variable returnVal ; Frame * pFrame=&pRuntimeEnvironment->pFrameStack[0 ] ; Object object=pFrame->stack[ pFrame->sp].object ; Variable * pVar =pRuntimeEnvironment ->pObjectHeap->GetObjectPointer( object ) ; if ( pVar ) { CString * pString = ( CString *) pVar [ 1 ] .ptrValue ; if ( pString ) wprintf ( _T ( " %s " ) , * pString ) ; } returnVal.intValue=0 ; return returnVal ; }
Here is the implementation ofmethod of Test class :
It is the native methods responsibility to correctly operate on stack .
The java instruction is here out of scope .
Everything is running on real machine here .
So , here we pop the string type object reference from stack , convert it to CString object and do our native printing to console .
This way we can handle any native operation like creating new window , drawing or do network operation .
All these things are done in the implementation of Morpheus project .
The Garbage Collector
Java language does not have memory release mechanism .
So the JVM must take the responsibility to release memory when some objects are out of scope no longer required or referenced by the application .
To do this the JVM may take a number of strategy like reference count , mark and sweep etc .
I used mark and sweep method because of its simplicily and accuracy .
We start from the stack .
We mark each object that is being referenced from the stack references .
Then we mark all the objects that is being referenced by the marked objects and so on recursively .
After the mark operation we know which objects are connected and which are out of scope .
Then we take each object one by one and release its memory from heap .
Before that we must call the finalize method of that object to do any cleanup required by the object itself programetically .
Conclusion
Thats all about to say for now about how we can implement a simple JVM .
The JVM I present here is very limited implementation - though most of the java instructions are supported .
It lacks heavily for library and native interface .
Please look at the seminar presentation downloadable above for a visual description of JVM and how instructions are executed in a JVM .
Full screen view of the presentation is best viewed with spacebar to go to next slide .
I am busy with the implementation of Morpheus project at my free time and wish to come with that as well as with a new JVM with a new Window subsystem implementation having Windows Vista and Office 2007 look and feel ( ok , ok , thats not technically a big deal but good to have for user interface degign ) and oh yes also with a .
NET Virtual Execution System with Morpheus for .NET support also .
The .NET VES is similar except the complex onfile structure is really painfull when I decode them .
All these things I do because I love to do - so I do not try to make a zero bug system .
I leave when it seems to work for ' Hello World ++' applications .

Joe Lieberman , senator and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee chairman , wants to censor what you watch on Google and YouTube .
Lieberman has sent a letter to Eric Schmidt , Google CEO , accusing the corporation of allowing “ offensive material ” on its site , namely “ videos produced by al - Qaeda and other Islamist terrorist groups . ”
Joe wants these taken down immediately and demands Google “ prevent them from reappearing . ”
No word if Schmidt has responded , but a letter sent by a bigwig commissar such as Lieberman is nothing to take lightly .
Schmidt and his corporate lawyers have likely confabbed .
“ Today , Islamist terrorist organizations rely extensively on the Internet to attract supporters and advance their cause .
The framework for much of this Internet campaign is described in a bipartisan staff report released last week by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs , which I am privileged to chair , titled Violent Islamist Extremism , the Internet , and the Homegrown Terrorist Threat , ” writes Lieberman .
“ The report explains , in part , how al - Qaeda created and manages a multi-tiered online media operation that produces content intended to enlist followers in countries all over the world , including the United States .
Central to this media campaign is the branding of content with an icon or logo to guarantee authenticity that the content was produced by al - Qaeda or allied organizations like al - Qaeda in Iraq , Ansar al - Islam ( a.k.a Ansar al - Sunnah ) or al - Qaeda in the Land of the Islamic Maghreb . ”
Or how about an “ allied organization ” such as the CIA , military intelligence or one of its cutouts ?
“ An expert computer analyst has presented evidence that so - called ‘ Al - Qaeda ’ tapes are routinely digitally doctored and has also unwittingly exposed an astounding detail that clearly indicates a Pentagon affiliated organization in the U.S. is directly responsible for releasing the videos , ” Paul Joseph Watson wrote last August .
Neal Krawetz , a researcher and computer security consultant , examined the image quantization table of a 2006 Ayman al - Zawahiri tape and made a fascinating discovery — al - Qaeda ’s As - Sahab logo ( supposedly the media arm of al - Qaeda ) was placed on the tape at the same time as the IntelCenter logo .
As it turns out , IntelCenter , notorious for releasing al - Qaeda videos , is run by Ben Venzke , former director of intelligence at a company called iDefense , a Verisign company .
Jim Melnick , a senior military psy - op intelligence officer who worked directly for Donald Rumsfeld , is billed as iDefense ’s director of threat intelligence .
In short , there is a distinct possibility the al - Qaeda videos mentioned by Lieberman are fake .
“ Searches on YouTube return dozens of videos branded with an icon or logo identifying the videos as the work of one of these Islamist terrorist organizations , ” Lieberman continues .
“ A great majority of these videos document horrific attacks on American soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Others provide weapons training , speeches by al - Qaeda leadership , and general material intended to radicalize potential recruits , ” that is to say patsies and useful idiots , easy marks for “ the process of radicalization , ” basically a Goldstein process .
Emmanuel Goldstein is a character from Orwell ’s dystopian novel , 1984 , a terrorist created by Big Brother ’s party , the subject of two minute hate sessions .
Like Winston Smith ’s fictional character , Comrade Ogilvy , Goldstein does not actually exist .
“ Comrade Ogilvy , who had never existed in the present , now existed in the past , and when once the act of forgery was forgotten , he would exist just as authentically , and upon the same evidence , as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar , ” writes Orwell .
Lieberman , speaking for the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , wants Google to “ immediately remove content produced by Islamist terrorist organizations from YouTube .
This should be a straightforward task since so many of the Islamist terrorist organizations brand their material with logos or icons identifying their provenance .
In addition , please explain what changes Google plans to make to the YouTube community guidelines to address violent extremist material and how Google plans to enforce those guidelines to prevent the content from reappearing . ”
Joe is simply preparing the way for the introduction of the so - called “ Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 , ” passed in the House by a 404 - 6 margin and now awaiting action in the Senate .
“ If passed in the Senate and signed into law by George W. Bush , the act would establish a ten- member National Commission on the Prevention of Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism , to study and propose legislation to address the threat of possible ‘ radicalization ’ of people legally residing in the US , ” writes Matt Renner .
“ The commission would have very broad powers .
It could investigate anyone .
It would create a public perception that whoever is being investigated by the Commission must be involved in subversive or illegal activities .
It would give the appearance that whoever they are investigating is potentially a traitor or disloyal or a terrorist , even if all they were doing was advocating lawful views , ” Renner quotes Odette Wilkens , executive director of the Equal Justice Alliance , a constitutional watchdog group .
Rep. Jane Harman , who sponsored the bill in the House , has said the Commission would not only investigate al - Qaeda inspired terrorists , but “ gangs ” too , as we all know street gangs are basically terrorists at heart .
It is no mistake a House Committee on Homeland Security lumped terrorists and 9/11 truth activists together last November .
During a presentation held before Jane Harman and the committee , Mark Weitzman of the Simon Wiesenthal Center — and his colleagues from the RAND corporation — made a point of including two 9/11 truth websites as evidence of “ homegrown terrorism , ” as 9/11 truth research and websites are now to be considered “ incubators for hate , ” as Weitzman would have it , because , of course , questioning the official orthodoxy is always considered hateful ( see AE911 Truth Response to Mark Weitzman of the Simon Wiesenthal Center ) .
Add to this a concerted effort on the part of the corporate media to demonize 9/11 truth , viz. , Glenn Beck comparing truth activists to Timothy McVeigh and Geraldo Rivera stating his belief the large firecracker set off on the doorstep of a military recruiting center in Times Square was the work of “ ‘ 9/11 was an inside job ’ kind of guys , ' ” who Rivera compared to “ eco terrorists . ”
In fact , Weitzman and crew made a direct link between jihadist terrorism and 9/11 truth “ extremists ” :
Some of these are conspiracy theories that present a closed view of the world , such as blaming 9/11 as an “ outside job ” ( ? ) or blaming outside groups such as the U.S. government , or er the Jews etc , some of these are pro-Iraqi insurgency videos , some of them are media portals that people can enter into , ones that you saw earlier with the flags , the U.S. flags show that they were based on U.S. servers … ( see Steve Watson & Paul Watson , House Subcommittee Presentation Equates 9/11 Truth With Terrorism . )
Joe Lieberman ’s letter to Eric Schmidt and Google concentrates exclusively on “ videos produced by al - Qaeda and other Islamist terrorist groups , ” never mind questions about the authenticity of these videos , but as the presentation of Mark Weitzman of the Simon Wiesenthal Center held before Harman ’s committee reveals , so - called jihadist terrorists are not the only target of this proposed scrubbing — let ’s call it what it is , censorship — of the internet .
Beck , Morning Joe , Rivera , et al , have provided the required propaganda equating 9/11 truth with terrorism and as we have seen , most recently at the Louisville Exposition Center , it is now apparently acceptable for cops and private security goons to attack truth activists , same as they might attack Timothy McVeigh , had they the chance .
But then , like fake al - Qaeda videos passed off as the real McCoy , it appears McVeigh was directed by a high - level FBI agent , according to Terry Nichols , who was long ago gagged by John Ashcroft .
In a 19 - page declaration filed in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City early last year , Nichols said “ that the whole bombing plot [ of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City ] was an FBI operation and that McVeigh let slip during a bout of anger that he was taking instruction from former FBI official Larry Potts , ” according to the Desert Morning News .
As usual , things are not exactly the way the government tells us they are .
—
Editor ’s Note : Google has refused to honor Lieberman ’s “ request ” ( or intimidation , take your pick ) .
“ While we respect and understand his views , YouTube encourages free speech and defends everyone ’s right to express unpopular points of view , ” the company said in a statement .
“ We believe that YouTube is a richer and more relevant platform for users precisely because it hosts a diverse range of views , and rather than stifle debate , we allow our users to view all acceptable content and make up their own minds . ”
John Morris , senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology , said Lieberman ’s letter was a practical impossibility and having sites such as YouTube pre-screen content would radically change how the Internet is used .
But then that ’s the point , no ?
Obviously , Google and Morris are with al - Qaeda .

The New York Times is reporting Paterson Warns of Economic Crisis .
In a rare , brief televised address , Gov. David A. Paterson announced on Tuesday afternoon that he would call the Legislature into an emergency session on Aug. 19 to address what he called an economic and budget crisis confronting New York State as a result of plummeting revenues and rising costs .
The new governor avoided any mention of new taxes , instead arguing forcefully for austerity .
He said he was calling on the Legislature to reduce the size of the state workforce ; cut agency spending ; reduce property taxes for homeowners ; aid New Yorkers with the soaring costs of home energy ; and even consider public - private partnerships that would take over state assets .
“ Revenues are dropping dramatically , ” the governor added .
At the start of May , the state budget office projected a cumulative deficit of $ 21.5 billion over the next three years .
Now , just two months later , that estimate has risen to $ 26.2 billion — “ a staggering 22 percent increase in less than 90 days . ”
Mr. Paterson offered another example of the rapid deterioration in the state ’s finances .
In June 2007 , he said , the 16 banks that pay the most on their business profits remitted $ 173 million to the state treasury .
“ This June , just a month ago , they sent us $ 5 million — a 97 percent decrease , ” he said .
He vowed , “ We will cut spending .
Government will learn to do more with less . ”
He called for help from business and labor leaders and New York ’s representatives in Washington to support him .
He added , “ It is time for New York and other governments to cut up our credit cards .
The era of ‘ buy now and pay later , and later ’ is over .
The faster we address this crisis , the faster and stronger we will emerge from it . ”
Era of ‘ buy now and pay later , and later ’ is over
In June 2007 , the 16 banks that pay the most on their business profits remitted $ 173 million to the state treasury .
“ This June , just a month ago , they sent us $ 5 million — a 97 percent decrease .
Can Paterson Deliver ?
The Right Mindset
Cutting spending
Learning to do with less
Austerity
Reduce the size of the government workforce
Reduce property taxes
( LifeWire ) --
The whispers and pointing started as soon as Sara Price reached her assigned table at her friend 's wedding reception in Houston last January .
Did she have raccoon eyes from crying during the ceremony ?
Mismatched shoes ?
A giant stain on her blouse ?
Single women guests at weddings can feel uncomfortable if questioned about the state of their romantic life .
Apparently it was much worse :
The Dallas woman had the audacity to come to the wedding ... single .
Price became the object of stares and sympathy as the only unattached person at her table .
" I tried to play it off -- I was n't going to have a fit , " says the 23 - year - old marketing coordinator .
" They became very protective of me , but then it was almost worse because it felt like they were pitying me . "
With the most recent U.S. census data counting nearly 90 million unmarried Americans -- a whopping 41 percent of all adults -- Price is in good company .
But woe to the singles who show up at the stream of summertime nuptials that constitute wedding season .
From nosy questions about their marital status to tedious rituals like the bouquet toss , they get nearly as much attention as the bride and groom -- except much of it is unwanted .
" The whole emphasis in this culture is that it 's a sin to be single .
It 's crazy , " says Linnda Durre , Ph.D. , an Orlando , Florida - based psychotherapist who counsels many singles .
At weddings , unattached guests are " afraid people will think they 're a loser and that they can't find a date , " Durre says .
" It 's so foolish . "
Managing the merger mania
Valid or not , the stress is sometimes enough to unhinge the uncoupled .
As Doree Lewak watched many of her friends head to the altar , she felt so much pressure to follow suit that she started unintentionally sabotaging her romantic relationships .
" I really drove one relationship into the ground because I panicked so much , " says Lewak , a 28 - year - old freelance writer from New York City .
" The guy almost had no choice but to run because I did n't make the relationship about us -- I made it about getting married and put it on an artificial timeline . "
Lewak learned so much from the process that she decided to pen the book " The Panic Years " -- which evidently start after 25 -- advising readers how to change their relationship strategy from petrified to proactive .
" When you face so much pressure about getting married , " she says , " it really chips away at your psyche . "
Katie Judd is dealing with a double emotional wallop .
The 26 - year - old Bostonian recently broke up with her boyfriend and is helping plan her sister 's October wedding .
It 's her younger sister , by the way -- not a small point when the pressure to pair becomes palpable .
Judd , an account executive in digital media relations , is bracing herself for rude or withering comments at her sister 's celebration , where she will serve as maid of honor .
" I think it would be ... awful to hear something like , ' It will happen for you someday , ' because it will sound supportive , but it 's really not , " Judd says .
Even those who attend weddings with significant others are not immune to snarky , intrusive questions about their relationship status .
Zac Rantz of Nixa , Missouri , has gone to quite a few ceremonies with his girlfriend of eight months only to find that other guests think " just dating " is n't quite good enough .
" Everyone else can think we 're the perfect couple , and we can agree , but that does n't mean we 're ready to get married , " says Rantz , 28 , a school district public information officer .
" These questions can be awkward , because it 's between the two of us and not everyone else . "
Aside from avoiding annoying queries and dodging the dreaded bouquet toss -- " I sneak out before that , " says Price -- how can singles keep their dignity at weddings and have fun in the process ?
The most effective tactic may be to get out of their own heads , says Clay Cockrell , a Manhattan - based therapist who counsels many singles .
" All eyes are on the bride , " says Cockrell , 38 .
" While you may feel uncomfortable about being single , it 's really not about you .
Realizing that you are not the focus of attention can reduce anxiety . "
As for the happy couple , Cockrell offers several tips to help them show more sensitivity to their single guests at the reception :
• Plan a fun table .
Scattering your single friends throughout the room isolates them and can place them in awkward situations .
Avoid this by putting them all together .
• Do n't ban the Chicken Dance .
You may hate group dances such as the Macarena and the Electric Slide , but remember that singles like to dance , too , and making them watch countless slow dances between couples can be excruciating .
• Empathize .
Try to remember what it was like to go to weddings when you were single .
If you toss the bouquet , refrain from yelling out singles ' names or dragging them to the floor .
• Keep in mind that wedded bliss is great ... for you : Baltimore wedding planner Linnyette Richardson - Hall , 47 and divorced , has had many a client try to fix her up at their nuptials during her 16 years in the business .
" A lot of times when you 're happy like that , you want everyone on that train , " she says .
" But I think I 'll stay at the station . "

All over America , arenas are filled with young girls and their mothers engulf in the persona of one Miley Cyrus , Walt Disney ’s Hannah Montana .
Not only do they attend her concerts , but they also are buying her merchandise to an estimated tune of 1 billion dollars in 2008 .
These mothers and young girls see Miley as a role model .
Someone that portrays the message of a “ good girl . ”
Thanks to Vanity Fair this has all changed .
Fifteen - year - old Walt Disney superstar and her advisers got this wild idea from some marketing genius to pose topless for Vanity Fair .
That being said , she was semi-covered by a satin sheet , but who in their right mind gave her the go ahead for this ?
She ’s 15 years old for God ’s sake .
The backlash is going to be far and wide .
Mothers who have seen these photos are outraged and are concerned of this new image that Miley is trying to convey .
Let ’s face it , whether they like it or not , kid stars seldom every get past the personal brand they build as kids .
Sorry Ms. Miley Cyrus you will always be known as Hannah Montana and after this last stunt you could be seen more like celebrity trainwreck Britney Spears .
If you want to destroy your brand here are a few tips by Miley Cyrus :
Forget who your audience is .
Listen to advisers who only have their best interest in mind
Think your product ( you ) is something that it ’s not .
Get business tips from someone who is still recovering from an “ Achy Breaky Heart . ”
Forget what made you a success and how you got there .
For Ms. Miley Cyrus ’s sake she better have a good PR firm to help smooth this one over .
If not you can say goodbye to another teen star ruined by a marketing team that does n’t understand what suburban girls and their mothers are buying into .
yak shaving で人生の 問 題 の 80 % が説明できる問 題
つい最近、 yak shaving （ヤクの毛を刈る）、という言葉を知りました ( 原典 ) 。これ は 「 一見無関係に見えるけど、真の問題を解くのに必要な問題を解くのに必要な（これが何段階も続く）問題を解くのに必要な活動」という意味の言葉です。
yak shaving は、ようする に 「 ある問題を解こうと思ったら別の問題が出てきて、それを解こうと思ったらさらに別の問題が出てきて…」ということが延々と続く状況を表しています。ちなみに、ヤクとは毛が長い、牛の一種です。
yak shaving は、以前に覚えた bikeshed と同じくらい便利そうな表現です。というもの、プログラムを書いていると yak shaving 的な状況がすぐに発生するためです 。
たとえば 、「 Amazon のほしい物リストを CSV 形式に変換し て Excel で読み込むプログラムがあったら便利かな」なんていう一見簡単そうなことをやろうとしても、次のような状況が発生するのは目に見えています。
「 さーて、まずはほしい物リストのページをとってくるか」「うげ、SSLでログインが必要かよ」「えーと、SSLでページとってくるにはどうするんだっけ」「うわ、OpenSSL 入ってねー 」 「インストールインストール 」 「 で、これ使って Basic 認証…、じゃねーし 」 「これ POST で認証かよ、どうやるんだっけ、あー Cookie も使ってるのか 」 「 こういうのってやるのなんかなかったけ 」
「 Mechanize とかいうの使えばいいわけ。へーなるほど 」 「 で、ようやくページゲット 」 「 あれ、これ UTF - 8 じゃないの ? いまどき Shift_JIS かよ... 」 「 Shift_JIS を UTF - 8 に変換するのどうやるんだっけ 」
「あー、なんかライブラリでできるのね。変換変換...」
「うげー、全角の波線が半角チルダになっちまったよ。なんでやねん」「はあ、shift_jis と cp932 の変換テーブルは違うのか。さすが
Wikipedia は役立つぜ、ところでジンバブエはどうなってるんだっけ 」「なんかこの HTML ごちゃごちゃしてるなー。正規表現でうまくスクレイプできるんかな。って、メールアドレスの正規表現はこんなに長いのかよ。ああ、なんか他になかったっけ」「ナイスブログ発見、Scraper とかいうの使えばいいのか。やってみるかな」「で、これCSVにするのは、カンマいれればいいだけか」「と思ったら値段にカンマ入ってるし。余計なことするなよな、ようはダブルクオートすればいいのね」「と思ったら、今度は本のタイトルにダブルクオート入ってるし、勘弁してほしいし 」「やれやれ、なんか CSV にまで RFC あるのかよ 」 「 ってこれやって も Excel でやっぱ読めねーし。いってよしすぎる 」 「 そういや、最近 の Excel って XML 読み込めなかったっけ。どういうフォーマットだろう、こっちでいくかなー 」 「 で、XML の処理ってどうやるんだ。んー、 libxml とかいうのが必要なの？うげ、やっぱ入ってないし 」
「 インストールインストール 」
「うわ、パッケージのバージョン古くてなんか動かない問題発生！」「自分でビルドするか。やな予感するなー 」「うわ、やっぱビルドエラー！」「 libtool 入れろってなんなのよ 」 「しかも libtool 入れてもコンパイルエラーで止まっちゃうし 」 「 これって gcc のバージョンが古いってこと？ 」 「 gcc 入れるか 」 「 ってサイト、ダウンしてるし 」 「そろそろブログでもチェックするかな、って、なんでこれが
600 ブックマーク超えてるの？ 」
実際のところ、プログラムを書き始めてから今にいたるまで、年がら年中こんなようなことをやっているわけで、my life is yak shaving という感じであります 。
そう感じるのはめずらしくないようで、 Joi Ito 氏は " Acutally , my whole life is just one big yak shaving exercise . " と言っています。なんだか yak shaving という言葉だけで人生の問題のほとんどを説明できるような気がしてきました。
C is not an easy language to parse .
A cursory glance at its BNF grammar should convince anyone immediately .
One of the hairiest parts of the grammar is type declarations .
The creators of C , Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie , admit it themselves in the beginning of section 5.12 of K&R2 ( " The C programming language 2nd Ed " ) :
C is sometimes castigated for the syntax of its declarations , particularly ones that involve pointers to functions .
The syntax is an attempt to make the declaration and the use agree ; it works well for simple cases , but it can be confusing for the harder ones , because declarations cannot be read left to right , and because parentheses are over -used .
Quick , what is the type of foo here :
char *(*(** foo [ ] [ 8 ] ) ( ) ) [ ] ;
Oh , you did n't know it 's foo is array of array of 8 pointer to pointer to function returning pointer to array of pointer to char ?
Shame on you ...
Seriously , though , type declarations in C are complex , and sometimes are n't intuitive .
There is , however , a relatively simple method of reading them .
First of all , declarations consist of a basic type and modifiers :
/* int is a basic type */ int x ; /* [ ] is the ' array of ' modifier */ int x [ 5 ] ; /* * is the ' pointer to ' modifier */ int * x ; /* ( ) is the ' function returning ...' modifier ' */ int ( * fptr ) ( void ) ;
When you see a complex declaration , first recognize the basic type and the variable name .
In :
int ( * x ) [ 10 ] [ 20 ] ;
The basic type is int and the variable name is x .
Therefore , this declaration means x is ... int for some yet unknown value of ...
To read the modifiers , go to the right from the variable name as long as you can - that is , until you run into a semicolon or a closing right parenthesis .
When you reach one of these stops , start going left until you reach an opening left parenthesis ( or the basic type , in which case you 're done ) .
Each time you see a new modifier ( either going right or left ) , attach it to the end of the current declaration sentence .
Let 's see some examples :
/* x is int ( but that was easy ... ) */ int x ; /* go right from ' x ' - we hit the array and then get stuck on the ' ; ' , so we start going left , where there 's nothing .
so : x is an array [ 5 ] of int */ int x [ 5 ] ; /* there 's nothing to the right , but a ' *' to the left , so : x is a pointer to int */ int * x ; /* now , combining these cases : x is an array [ 5 ] of pointer to int */ int * x [ 5 ] ; /* how about this ? x is an array [ 5 ] of array [ 2 ] of int */ int x [ 5 ] [ 2 ] ; /* hey , this is becoming easy ... x is an array [ 5 ] of array [ 2 ] of pointer to pointer to int */ int ** x [ 5 ] [ 2 ] ; /* grouping parantheses complicate things , but not too much .
trying to go right from ' x ' , we hit the closing paren , so we go left .
After we attach the pointer we see an opening paren , so we can go right again : x is a pointer to array [ 5 ] of int */ int ( * x ) [ 5 ] ; /* function declarations are just like arrays : we go right from ' x ' , and attach ' array [ 4 ] of ' then we hit the paren , and go left , attaching ' pointer to ' .
Then , we hit the left paren , so we go right again , attaching ' function ( char , int ) returning '
And eventually : x is an array [ 4 ] of pointer to function ( char , int ) returning int */ int ( * x [ 4 ] ) ( char , int ) ;
I hope you 're now convinced that the task of understanding C type declarations is n't that difficult .
Some final notes :
LONDON �( CNNMoney.com ) --
The high cost of gas is one thing Americans wo n't be celebrating on July 4 .
Retail gas prices in the U.S. rose overnight to a record high for the fifth straight day , a daily survey by auto club AAA showed Friday .
The national average price for a gallon of regular gas rose to an all - time high of $ 4.101 , up from $ 4.098 the previous day .
Gas prices have surged 39 % in the last year and are up about 3 % in the last month .
Alaska has the highest gas prices in the nation .
Drivers in the state pay an average of $ 4.623 a gallon for regular gas .
The state with the lowest gas prices is Oklahoma , where a gallon of gas costs $ 3.901 on average .
The national average price for diesel fuel ticked higher to $ 4.769 a gallon , up from $ 4.767 the day before .
Record high gas prices have pinched consumers and forced many Americans to cut back on the amount of driving they do .
Thirty - one percent of Americans have canceled or shortened their planned holiday weekend vacation because of rising gas prices , according to a CNN / Opinion Research poll released Wednesday .
McCain denies he misstated timing of Iraq surge
Republican John McCain pushed back on Wednesday against Democratic criticism that he misstated when the troop buildup ordered by President Bush began , saying elements were put in place before Bush announced the strategy in early 2007 .
He told reporters during an unscheduled stop in a super market that , what the Bush administration calls " the surge " was actually " made up of a number of components , " some of which began before the president 's order for more troops .
It 's all a matter of semantics , he suggested .
McCain said Army Col. Sean MacFarland started carrying out elements of a new counterinsurgency strategy as early as December 2006 .
At issue are McCain 's comments in a Tuesday interview with CBS .
The Arizona senator disputed Democrat Barack Obama 's contention that a Sunni revolt against al - Qaida combined with the dispatch of thousands more U.S. combat troops to Iraq to produce the improved security situation there .
McCain called that a " false depiction . "
Democrats jumped on his comments .
They said McCain 's remarks showed he was out of touch , because the rebellion of U.S. - backed Sunni sheiks against al - Qaida terrorists in Iraq 's Anbar province was under way well before Bush announced in January 2007 his decision to send 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Iraq .
McCain asserted he knew that and did n't commit a gaffe .
" A surge is really a counterinsurgency made up of a number of components .
... I 'm not sure people understand that `surge ' is part of a counterinsurgency . "
Speaking on CBS Tuesday of a Sunni sheik who approached Col. MacFarland , McCain said , " Because of the surge , we were able to go out and protect that sheik and others .
And it began the Anbar awakening . "
On Wednesday McCain continued to try to portray his opponent as naive on Iraq while the Illinois Democrat is visiting the war zone , the Middle East and Europe .
" I am again deeply disappointed that Sen . Obama will not recognize that the surge has succeeded , " McCain said .
He said that " no rational person " could think otherwise .
McCain said he had been briefed by Col. MacFarland , commander of 1st Brigade , 1st Armored Division , in December 2006 to discuss the strategy that remains in force today .
Bush announced the surge in January 2007 and the first of the new troops began operations in Iraq in early February 2007 .
McCain made an unscheduled stop at " Kings Supermarket " in a shopping mall here , and greeted shoppers and commiserated with them on the soaring costs of both food and fuel .
" Among other challenges , Americans face the price of milk at over $ 4 a gallon , " McCain told reporters as he stood in front of a dairy case .
But questions quickly turned to other subjects .
McCain brushed aside a question on a running mate when asked whether Minnesota 's Republican governor , Tim Pawlenty , was now at the top of his list .
" I can't mention names , " he said .
But asked what he thought of Pawlenty , McCain said , " He 's a great , fine person . "
" He , and ( Louisiana Gov. ) Bobby Jindal and a number of other governors are the future of the Republican party , " McCain said .
McCain had been headed to Louisiana later Wednesday , but bad weather generated by Hurricane Dolly , forced a last minute postponement of the trip .
He was going to Ohio instead .
Earlier , campaigning in Wilkes - Barre , Pa. , McCain credited the recent $ 10 - a - barrel drop in the price of oil to President Bush 's lifting of a presidential ban on offshore drilling , an action he has been advocating in his presidential campaign .
The cost of oil and gasoline is " on everybody 's mind in this room , " McCain told a town - hall meeting .
He criticized Obama for opposing drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf .
Bush recently lifted the executive order banning offshore drilling that his father put in place in 1990 .
He also asked Congress to lift its own moratorium on oil exploration on the outer continental shelf which includes coastal waters as close as three miles from shore .
" The price of oil dropped $ 10 a barrel , " said McCain , who argued that the psychology of lifting the ban has affected world markets .
The White House did n't go that far .
Presidential spokeswoman Dana Perino said the price drop also could reflect diminished demand .
" I do n't know if we fully deserve the credit , " Perino said .
" We do n't predict what happens in the market , " she said .
" We can't really tell .
Certainly , taking that action would send a signal that at least the executive branch is serious about moving forward and increasing the supply we have in America . "
A barrel of light , sweet crude fell $ 1.86 to $ 126.56 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
That 's down from more than $ 140 a barrel earlier in the summer .
There are 42 gallons in each barrel .

San Francisco's Market Street from the Embarcadero to Hayes Valley would permanently close to all traffic except for city mass transit vehicles under a proposal announced at City Hall on Tuesday night .
Supervisor Chris Daly asked the city attorney to draft legislation to permanently ban cars on Market Street between Octavia Boulevard and the Embarcadero , an idea that has been floated by various city leaders , including former Mayor Willie Brown , for more than a decade .
Daly said discussion of a proposal by Mayor Gavin Newsom to close portions of city streets , including a large stretch of the Embarcadero , on two Sundays this year prompted his action .
" It 's the city 's grand boulevard , " Daly said .
" Why do n't we go for the gold ? "
Closing the 2.3 - mile portion of Market Street would open the often - congested roadway to pedestrians and cyclists , though Daly said there would still need to be places where cars and other vehicles could cross .
He said the traffic that now relies on that roadway could shift to Mission , Howard and Folsom streets to the south .
In addition to this proposal , the Municipal Railway is currently considering a plan to make major improvements to transit on Market Street and throughout the city .
Another idea that has been floated would redesign stretches of the street to create distinct bicycle lanes .
Brown 's vision of banning private automobiles on Market Street faced strong opposition from the business community and never materialized .
Daly 's proposal will face multiple hurdles at City Hall , including approval from the full board and Newsom , before it can be enacted .

Takei appeared in the popular TV series Heroes last year
US actor George Takei is to wed his long - term partner after California lifted its ban on same - sex marriage .
Takei , 71 , best known for playing Mr Sulu in Star Trek , said he and Brad Altman were going through the " delicious dilemma " of where to marry .
The actor and 54 - year - old Mr Altman have been together for 21 years .
" We can have the dignity , as well as all the responsibilities , of marriage .
We embrace it all heartily , " Takei wrote on his website .
' Good times '
Takei , who recently appeared in the popular US TV series Heroes , added : " We 've worked in partnership ; he manages the business side of my career and I do the performing .
" We 've travelled the world together from Europe to Asia to Australia .
We 've shared the good times as well as struggled through the bad .
" He helped me care for my ailing mother who lived with us for the last years of her life .
He is my love and I can't imagine life without him . "
On Thursday , California 's Supreme Court said the " right to form a family relationship " applied to all Californians regardless of sexuality .
But opponents of the decision said they would seek an amendment to the state constitution , which would override the ruling .
Following the Supreme Court 's decision to legalise same - sex marriage , comedian Ellen DeGeneres announced plans to marry her girlfriend , actress Portia de Rossi .
Man begs doctors to stop his journey into womanhood
A British man is pleading with the medical community to help him regain his chemical , and visual , masculinity .
Father of five and pub singer Terry Wright , 60 , has been slowly transforming from male to female for about ten years , baffling medical experts and prompting his doctor to offer him gender reassignment surgery .
About ten years ago , his hair began to fall out , his skin became smooth and he began to develop breasts .
" I am a man , not a woman , " Wright said .
" And I do not want to be a woman . "
At 5 ' 4 " and with a slim frame , Wright fields taunts of " She - man " from children , and is awkwardly supported by " shocked " friends .
The closest possible explanation thus far , according to The Sun , is that Wright 's body tissues have become resistant to testosterone ; blood tests have revealed that he has high levels of both testosterone and estrogen .
Doctors have ruled out the hormone surge being caused by a tumor or hormone - blocking medication , and do n't know how to proceed .
" This case seems very unusual , " said University of Sheffield endocrinology specialist Professor Richard Ross to Telegraph .
" Doctors call me an ' interesting case ' and ' unique ' , " Wright said , " but I just want to go back to being a proper man . "

There are , as I understand it , police reports that people two freaking blocks away dialed 911 in a panic because they heard my screaming and crying in terror when I saw what was going on in the banks and at the Federal Reserve .
First off , Total Fed Credit was up about $ 5 billion last week , which is , in the parlance , " goodly sized ! " , which makes me howl in dismay because this is the ultimate source of fiat money !
Total Fed Credit is the legendary stuff from which fiat money springs �
From the bowels of the banks , in whose bowels this credit first appeared ( thanks to the Fed depositing it there from their bowels ! ) , and which was turned into some multiple of this $ 5 billion credit when someone borrowed some huge , unbelievable multiple ( fractional reserve banking at its finest ! ) of this $ 5 billion increase in TFC from the aforementioned banks .
That is the situation in a nutshell , and if you are suddenly cold with fear and you feel a scream of terror rising in your chest at the obvious fraud , then congratulations !
This means that you are achieving Total Mogambo Enlightenment ( TME ) , which means you now understand the significance of the seeming overuse of the word " bowels " in the preceding paragraph , and now you are appropriately disgusted at the repellent true nature of fiat money .
One of the benefits of TME is that there are no real bowels involved at all ( unlike when raising children or pets ) , nor any fees or dues to pay , except for the price of your very soul and sanity , because now you begin to comprehend the terrifying enormity of what happens to a country so completely idiotic that they ignore their own Constitution 's Article 1 , Section 10 requirement that only silver and gold coin can be made a tender in payment of debt , and instead , use the One Damned Thing ( ODT ) that the Founding Fathers and everybody else feared above all others , namely a fiat currency !
A damned silly piece of paper or electronic fluff that can be increased , without limit , at the mere caprice of an authority figure , which is the ODT we did n't want because this inevitable increase in the supply of fiat money leads to increases in prices , and history is FULL of the ugliness of what happens when people can no longer afford food because their money is rendered worthless !
It 's a killer - diller !
As the solid foundation of your True Mogambo Enlightenment ( TME ) , you have the fact that not once in the 4,000 - year history of man and money has this " fiat money " crap NOT led to total ruination .
Not once .
Not even close .
And then , as your TME skills grow and develop , you will become evermore horrified , evermore paranoid , evermore suspicious and hateful , when you read things like how the Non-Borrowed Reserves in the banks hit a new record in disgusting banking infamy ; they now have to report a staggering negative $ 111.8 billion in Non-Borrowed Reserves !
The brain explodes ; " What ?
Total Reserves in the banks are the same lousy $ 42 billion that they have always laughably been for the freaking last decade or so , but now Non-Borrowed Reserves are a negative $ 111.8 billion ?
Gaaaahhhh !
It makes no sense !
Do n't make me crap in my pants out of horror ! "
Of course , it will just keep getting weirder , and you will crap in your pants at the horror of the economic mistakes being made , and your TME skills will grow stronger until one day you find yourself gobbling heart medication by the handful at the mere sight of a fact like , well , how last week the Fed itself sold another $ 17 billion of its stash of government debt .
Interestingly , the Federal Reserve has now sold over one - third of its stash , taking their remaining stranglehold on us , through our money , down to $ 502 billion , waaAAAaaaay off from the $ 790 billion they had in August , 2007 , and even down from their $ 713 billion in March , just two months ago !
Panic mode !
And as you quickly blossom into a full - fledged Junior Mogambo Ranger ( JMR ) after about two minutes of TME , you will be outraged and personally insulted that only you , of all the people around you - people that you now regard with contempt and loathing - see the awful significance of how inflation in prices is the thing that is going to destroy this country , which it will because the demonic Alan Greenspan and the Fed has destroyed our country by creating so much money and credit for so many , many years , which produced , first , inflation in the prices of stocks and the prices of bonds , which everyone loved , and then inflation in the size of government , which everyone loved , then inflation in the prices of houses , which everyone loved , and now inflation in commodities like food and energy , which nobody loves , and now nobody likes you because you remind them of me , and they all hate me , and I hate them back because they are stupid and they elected people to Congress who have destroyed us .
And though you will , thanks to the True Mogambo Enlightenment ( TME ) side of you , foresee many , many horrors that will inflict the dollar , and thus the country , and be sorely afraid , you will also know that the answer to your own financial salvation , and verily the salvation of a country , is to own gold .
And you will .
It 's the Greedy Mogambo Side ( GMS ) of you that makes you think that the only thing better than financial salvation is having lots and lots of financial salvation , and that path lies in owning lots and lots of gold and silver .
Me , too !

As yields decline and government prices remain low , farmers say that profits are increasingly elusive , and in some areas farmers have begun to abandon their fields .
One farmer in Jizzax said he had stopped farming one parcel that had grown too salty , and he drove with a reporter past abandoned fields that stretched as far as the eye could see , more than 700 acres , he said .
As in Soviet times , production plans are not closely coordinated with the realities on the ground , and in Jizzax the local authorities , whose jobs depend on fulfilling quotas , have started to force bad fields  about a third of the cultivated land area in the region , according to local statistics  onto state institutions such as the post office , the state pension fund and schools , three farmers there said .
Those , in turn , are forced to farm the land or to pay cash to satisfy the quota .
“ Jizzax is an experiment , ” said one of the farmers , who asked that his name not be published to avoid trouble with local officials .
He provided a document for a plot of land that had been abandoned by a farmer and was now the responsibility of a local school .
Farmers who did not meet quotas were fined and even taken to court , as was the case in April with 89 farmers .
“ Farmers have no rights , ” he said .
“ They are just ordered around by the government . ”
The farmers who are fined must pay with cash , which forms the heart of a cycle of corruption that has enriched officials for generations .
Those officials , envied and vulnerable to charges of corruption , change with the seasons :
In Jizzax , there have been five heads of the main cotton processing factory since 2000 , the farmers said .
Some farmers violate the government ’s rules and plant crops other than cotton , a practice that has been encouraged by foreign experts who say that crop rotation will allow the land to rest .
But the government has often prohibited other crops , not wanting to suffer declines in cotton , and farmers grow other things at their own risk .
This spring in Tajikistan , a neighboring country that also relies on cotton , farmers were growing watermelons on the sly , as though they were crops of illicit opium poppies .
“ We are destroying ourselves , ” said the 61 - year - old farmer in Khujayli .
“ Why are we planting cotton , and what are we getting from it ?
We never ask those questions . ”
The government is starting to acknowledge the problem , and last year it issued an order that will set up a fund for drainage improvements .
The World Bank is also financing a program to improve drainage .
NEW YORK , May 3 ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon is considering sending up to 7,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan next year to make up for a shortfall in contributions from NATO allies , The New York Times reported on Saturday .
Citing unnamed Bush administration officials , the Times said the push could drive U.S. forces in Afghanistan to some 40,000 , the highest level since the United States invaded the country in 2001 and toppled the Taliban government .
One official said it would likely result in " the re-Americanization " of the war .
The increase would drive U.S. troops presence from about half to two - third of foreign troops in Afghanistan , and would require a reduction in troops levels in Iraq by at least a modest amount , the newspaper said .
Planning for the increase began in recent weeks , it said .
" There are simply going to be more American forces than we 've ever had there , " the Times quoted a senior official as saying .
NATO commanders in Afghanistan say they need about 10,000 more troops , but some dozen NATO countries have pledged only about 2,000 , the Times said , citing unnamed NATO officials .
So far only France has begun preparing more troops for deployment -- some 700 .
The officials also said the decision for more troops could be left to the next U.S. president , who will take office in January , and that few additional troops were expected in Afghanistan any time soon .

Oil man T. Boone Pickens testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs committee today that the energy crisis is a national security threat and an emergency that needs to be dealt with immediately .
“ By spending this $ 700 billion year importing oil - more than four times the cost of the Iraqi War — we are strangling our economy and putting ourselves and our nation in greater harm ’s way .
All without our enemies ever having to raise a hand in anger .
This is more than a disturbing trend line .
It is a recipe for national disaster .
This is a crisis that cannot be left to the next generation to solve and shame on all of us if we do n’t grab this bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground .
And we must do it now , ” Pickens said .
On July 8 , Pickens unveiled his plan the goal of which is to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by 38 % over the next decade , by harnessing our renewable energy resources .
“ I believe this plan provides a significant bridge to the future that gives us time to develop the next generation of alternative fuels , including electric vehicle .
It results in revitalizing much of rural America with more than $ 1 trillion in private investment within ten years instead of enriching other nations at our expense .
It can all be accomplished with private investment but needs government support by clearing the way for action , which means help on providing for transmission rights of way , the appropriate renewals of the renewable energy tax credits , among other things , ” Pickens said .

Pickens ’s plan is different from Al Gore ’s because he favors offshore oil drilling and drilling in ANWR , and he is more concerned that the foreign oil alternative is 100 % American .
“ I ’m for everything that ’s American , ” he said .
“ I only have one enemy , that ’s foreign oil .
That ’s what I want to get rid of . ”
Pickens said that he has spoken to Gore and he told him that , “ Global warming to me is page two .
I told Al I ’ll get to page two after we clean up page one ” – reducing the 72 percent of American energy produced by imported foreign oil . ”
Gore and Pickens have two different goals that share some overlaps .
Gore is interested in climate change , and Pickens is interested in getting rid of our dependence on foreign oil , by using wind and natural gas , but both men agree that we can’t drill our way out of this problem .
Gore was asked on last week ’s Meet the Press if he liked the idea that Pickens is out there with him on the issue , “ I do .
And , and I think it ’s really significant that one of the most successful oil industry figures is now investing a billion dollars of his own money in windmills .
He ’s looked at the figures that I was sharing with you a moment ago .
Wind is competitive . ”
I think Pickens can be very important in this debate with Republican members of Congress who have been outright hostile to an alternative energy policy .
This should not be a partisan issue .
The energy crisis is n’t a Democratic problem or a Republican problem .
It is an American problem that both parties should be working together to solve .
If Pickens and Gore can get on the same page , there is no reason why our politicians can’t join them .
When I saw Kent Beck 's " Extreme Programming Explained " in our office , I was shocked .
I 've already accepted the inevitable occasional purchasing of obscure C++ wisdom , exemplified by titles such as " Effective C++ " , " Exceptional C++ " , " Imperfect C++ " , " Modern C++ Design " and so on .
Yikes .
Oh well .
As long as nobody uses the boost libraries in production code , they can entertain themselves by ordering whatever they want as far as I 'm concerned .
But XP ?
A software development methodology ?
A programmer ordered a book on methodology ?
I have to find out who that was .
Well , I found out and the shock became worse , because it was one of the cooler kids .
Largely out of respect for that guy , I grabbed the book , took it home and read it .
What follows is my book review .
Spoiler : I say quite some positive things there .
XP and hire / fire dynamics
I did n't look for quotes on this subject , it 's just that all of them caught my eye .
Maybe it 's because HR implications of things are inherently interesting , maybe it 's because everything else in a " methodology " is life - threateningly boring , and maybe both .
Anyway , the quotes are :
" Given the choice between an extremely skilled loner and a competent - but - social programmer , XP teams consistently choose the more social candidate . "
Gotta love the " but " .
Well , what can I say about this approach ?
This approach would prevent the best pieces of software and hardware I 've seen developed from happening .
In all those cases , there was one or more " extremely skilled loners " .
More on that later , when we get to code ownership , open spaces , pair programming and the like .
For now , it 's sufficient to say that a methodology preferring mediocre to " extremely skilled " and calling itself " Extreme Programming " is , um , interesting .
That " competent - but - social " is a euphemism for " mediocre " is as clear to me as the fact that mediocrity , while related to lack of talent , is first and foremost a personal value .
" Here 's a sad but repeated story : a development team begins applying XP , dramatically improves quality and productivity , but then is disbanded , its leaders fired and the rest of the team scattered .
Why does this happen ? …
The team 's improved performance shifted the constraint elsewhere in the organization .
The new constraint ( e.g. marketing , who can't decide what they want fast enough ) does n't like the spotlight . "
I have a fairly developed imagination , especially when it comes to organizational dysfunctions .
For example , I can imagine how a team delivering a good result without working overtime will be appreciated less than a team delivering a bad result through heroic efforts ( this example is from the book , too ; of course the unappreciated team is the one " practicing " XP ) .
Getting fired over productivity ?
Because marketing can't invent features fast enough ?
What ??
Now , that certainly challenges one 's imagination skills .
But we are n't the kind of people to turn down a challenge , are we ?
OK , lez do it .
Imagine .
Imagine an organization so rotten , so disgusting , so peculiarly brain - damaged that it can fire people because they work too fast to invent new work for them .
Hooray !
We did it !
I see it right in front of my closed eyes !
But wait , what 's that ?
Are those unfortunate victims of corporate idiocy Extreme Programmers ?
The competent - but - social programmers ?
If they 're so " social " , ca n't they see what stinky a hole they 've landed at ?
You do n't get fired from such places ; you quit .
I mean , realizing that you 're in a hopeless human quagmire is among the most basic social skills – even I have it .
I failed the challenge .
I can't imagine this picture .
Brad Jensen , Senior VP , Sabre Airline Solutions : " If programmers wo n't pair or if they insist on owning code , have the courage to fire them .
The rest of the team will bail you ought . "
Aha. XP , the two - edged sward .
Get fired for using XP or get fired for refusing to use it .
Just ducky .
No , really .
I do n't want to be mean .
I wo n't even pick on the VP 's " courage to fire " wording .
You know what – I 'll even praise this wording .
The employer depends on a strong programmer more than the programmer depends on them , and firing an evil , antisocial strong programmer is likely the most courageous act a manager can commit .
All I 'm saying is , XP is basically this religious cult , as more quotes will show .
This cult is spreading in your organization .
They fire people .
They easily fire exceedingly productive people , " skilled loners " that wo n't " pair " and insist on code ownership – nothing evil or antisocial .
They fire people just for refusing to accept their most controversial " practices " .
Could it be the real reason for the occasional extermination of productive XP teams , assuming Kent Beck is right and the disbanded XP teams he saw actually were productive ?
With all those " loners " I work with and the kind of " process " we use , I can easily imagine my reaction to a hypothetical XP epidemic at my workplace .
Probably something along the lines of " Come and get me !
Let 's see who gets fired first . "
XP " practices "
Why do I place the word " practice " in quotes ?
I dunno , do you know a better way to typographically mark stupidity ?
The word kinda reminds of " spiritual practices " , the religion thing again .
But primarily it reminds me that there 's just too much money in this industry .
I mean , I have a relative who makes and sells ceramics .
Neither she nor her employees use any " best practices " .
There 's not enough money in ceramics for " practices " ; you have to work .
No time to listen to people talking about work , hence no market for their talks and writings .
This term is annoying on so many levels that I could go on for ages .
For example , the words " best practices " and " questionable practices " convey infinite amount of ignorant , arrogant idiocy .
You could never pass an exam citing " best practices " – you are supposed to analyze the problem and prove your solution .
But in the industry it 's perfectly possible to get away with , and even get promoted by substituting analysis with rules of thumb , irrelevant to the case in point as they may be .
OK , enough said about the term " practices " ; maybe it 's just me .
Let 's talk about some practices .
Sit Together
XP likes open space .
I do n't like open space .
I 'm exceptionally good at ignoring external events when I concentrate , to the point where it takes me 10 seconds to understand what you 're saying when you interrupt me in the middle of something .
But there 's a limit to this autism , and when lots of conversations I can relate to , intellectually and emotionally , happen around me , I can't work .
Many people have talked about the state of " flow " and how you do n't want to interrupt someone when they 're in it because they 're extremely productive , and how interrupting someone all the time means they work at a fraction of their full speed .
Myself , I " value " communication as this would be called in XP .
I like to talk to people , and people like to talk to me .
Lots of them .
And much as like it , I like flow , too , and closing the door in my room is quite a Best Practice .
To be fair , with XP , you wo n't be able to concentrate behind a closed door , either , because of …
Pair Programming
We 'll start with some quotes :
" Personal hygiene and health are important issues when pairing .
Cover your mouth when you cough .
Avoid strong colognes that might affect your partner . "
" When programmers are n't emotionally mature enough to separate approval from arousal , working with a person of the opposite gender can bring up sexual feelings that are not in the best interest of the team . "
" In Figure 6 the man has moved closer to the woman than is comfortable for her .
Neither is making his or her best technical decision at this point . "
" Programmers that wo n't pair . "
Sounds more like " programmers that wo n't couple . "
" I like to program with someone new every couple of hours … "
OK , OK , this is neither emotionally mature nor in the best interest of the team .
Enough with this sort of quotes .
XP measures time in " pair - hours " , since all production code must be written in pairs .
Since we programmers are good at math , it 's easy to see that this halves your task force .
Kent Beck claims that pairs are more than 2 x more productive than 2 people working alone , so it 's a net gain .
Is that really so , even if each of the 2 people can close the door ?
I worked in teams of size 2 or 3 , with everybody going pretty much at full speed , and I can't imagine gaining back the 2x spent on sitting together .
Maybe if you 're doing something so extraordinarily boring and trivial that you can barely move without talking to someone about it .
No , really , I think XP is for writing huge piles of straightforward code .
And here 's my proof .
Shared Code
As we 've seen , in XP , there 's no code ownership unless you want to get fired .
The code is owned by the team , and everybody can and is encouraged to change ( " refactor " ) any piece of code , any time .
This concludes the triad of XP practices that I 'll call " The Coupling Practices " , both because of my emotionally immature amusement with the quotes above and because of the coupling between everything ( it 's one system owned by everyone , not separate modules with separate owners ) .
The Coupling Practices are :
Open space
Work in pairs
No code ownership
Kent Beck raises just one objection to the shared code practice – people might act irresponsibly and make expedient changes .
Well , paranoid attitude towards coworkers is not one of my many sins ; if you trust someone to work for your company , then you trust them to act responsibly most of the time , do n't you think ?
My objections are different .
First , the coupling .
I'm a great believer in Conway 's Law : Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations .
I'm the great believer that I am simply because I 've never seen this law fail in practice .
Strong module boundaries mostly appear at social boundaries – code ownership and responsibility – or at technical boundaries ( different programming languages , different processes , different machines , kernel space / user space ) .
If everybody owns all modules , and unless each module is a separate kernel module , they 'll quite likely become one big hairy program .
And I do n't like coupling , at least not in this sense .
Sure , XP encourages refactoring , which should take care of the problem ; I just never saw anything beat Conway 's Law .
To me , it 's like defeating the law of gravity with spiritual practices .
My second objection is that shared ownership can't work except for trivial code , and this is the proof of the " XP is for trivial stuff " claim I 've made above .
Let me start with an example .
I used to think that ASIC engineers , the kind that write hardware description code in Verilog or VHDL , are sociopaths .
I mean , the ones I 've met were very helpful and patient when it came to explaining things to my feeble programmer mind , but apparently they could n't stand each other .
If one of them even touched another 's code , the other guy would go to pieces .
As a programmer , I was used to the Shared Code practice ( you do n't need XP to have a happy tar pit of coders friendly patching each other 's stuff ) .
So these hardware types scared me off .
And then I began to understand what you were saying in Verilog .
In hardware , you have a bunch of variables , and you have code that computes the next values of variables given their current values .
Hardware is like a huge recursive function of its registers ' state , with the reset logic being the base of the recursion .
Now , it 's trivial to understand how a variable is updated – it's spelled using the usual arithmetics and logic and if - then - else and stuff .
But understanding how all these updates propagate , and what will happen in , say , 4 cycles , and how the pipelines work together is , I dunno , impossible .
So you see , when you have this mental model of how this monstrous state machine works , and someone makes a change to it , you tend to be upset , because it 's hard to read someone else 's change and update your mental model .
And why are they so sure their change makes sense in the first place ?
They can't possibly understand everything there is to understand !
You could say that it's all irrelevant since XP is about software , and this is hardware , but to me , the line is quite blurred .
It 's code in a programming language .
You can run this code on a simulator or an FPGA without manufacturing anything , just by copying bits .
It 's software .
Now , obviously we have the other extreme – code so straightforward that you can read it from top to bottom and understand it completely .
Say , a one - screen script shoveling through the file system , doing simple regexpy parsing and printing statistics .
You know , Practical Extraction and Report .
They even have a Language for it .
The question is , where is most software – is it like a Verilog module or like a screenful of Perl ?
( BTW , my Verilog and Perl guru is the same person . )
Well , let 's see .
Low - level interrupt handling and scheduling code is definitely like Verilog – touch my code and I 'll go to pieces .
Compilers are also like Verilog , because you have complicated algorithms and you can't just read them and say " aha , I see why this is doing what it 's supposed to be doing " .
There are lots of heuristics and lots of knowledge about interaction of passes and complicated data structures .
Optimized image processing code is also like Verilog , because there are all the precision considerations and knowledge about the target optimizer and platform .
Computer vision code is also like Verilog …
Everything I currently deal with is like that .
I mean , code is not like descriptive prose you 'd put in a local wiki .
You can't read it , say " I get it ! " , update it , and make the author happy with the " refactoring " .
Code is more like poetry : change this line , and now the next line does n't rhyme , or you 've broken the rhythm , or you 've put angry words into a happy poem , that sort of trouble .
Which is one reason to like code ownership .
It 's probably useful to have a second programmer with " read access " to important pieces of code , so that at least 2 people can help debug each piece .
You can get there with code reviews , and without the Coupling Practices , which I can't imagine working except for code so straightforward that I doubt there 's much of its kind .
XP and CMM
Brad Jensen , Senior VP , Sabre Airline Solutions : " The pure XP projects have very few defects … ( Even ) the ( impure ) XP projects have very competitive defect rates , one to two defects per thousand lines of code .
The Bangalore SPIN , consisting of ten CMM level - five organizations , reports an average of 8 defects per thousand lines of code . "
" Defects per LOC " .
Interesting metric .
How do we improve it ?
First , we do n't record " defects " .
What 's a " defect " ?
Are 10 reported problems caused by one defect or several ?
Depends on the " root cause analysis " , which is of course up to us coders .
The second important thing to do is to write more code .
That guy working on the data - driven layout rendering should be taken out and shot .
We have editing macros for that .
You could squeeze 50 K LOC out of rendering if it was spelled as code like it should be .
Who is stupid enough to use a metric encouraging people to misattribute problem reports , increase code size , or simply quit the silly job ?
Why , it 's the Capability Maturity Model , of course .
Meet XP 's competitor : the dreadful CMM .
I could have received a certificate telling that I was trained in CMM , but I could n't take it and asked my manager to bail me out ( and so he did , THANKS !! ) .
It was stupid to the point of physical pain .
The CMM instructor , making $ 160 / hour , talked like this : " Blah - blah - blah - PRACTICE !!
Blah - blah - blah - ESTABLISH-AND-MAINTAIN !! Blah - blah - blah - GOAL !! " – yelling at some random word , so you could n't even fall asleep in the absence of any kind of rhythm your brain could learn to ignore .
The sleep deprivation and the countless repetitions caused some of the garbage to be ingrained in my memory .
Here 's an excerpt for ya .
CMM has 5 levels .
CMM level 1 is where you operate right now : it denotes the ability to ship something .
CMM level 5 , the one mentioned in the interview from Kent Beck 's book , denotes complete paralysis .
To do anything , you have to write or update so many documents , have so many meetings with " relevant stakeholders " , and to perform so many pointless measurements of the defects / LOC kind , that it 's much more productive to just go postal and at least remove a CMM auditor or two from the face of the Earth in the process .
Levels 2 to 4 indicate various intermediate stages where paralysis is spreading , but you can still ship .
For example , level 2 is called " Managed Process " .
" Managed Process is distinguished by the degree to which the process is Managed " .
I 'm not making this up .
There 's a book called Capability Maturity Model Integration , and this book , heavy enough to kill a human , is full of this sort of stuff .
Reading it is impossible .
And this is why I think XP is a great thing .
( See ?
I promised I 'll say positive things ; and I 'm not done yet ! )
I 've actually read Extreme Programming Explained .
About 75 % of it seemed meaningless , but I made it through .
The CMMI book , on the other hand , is pretty much infeasible .
CMM has hundreds of practices .
XP has a couple dozens .
CMM has extremely costly certification process .
XP does n't .
CMM forces you to write a zillion documents .
XP forces you to write a zillion tests , documentation of features , and story cards .
CMM is about lengthening the development cycle .
XP is about shortening the development cycle .
CMM is inflicted on you by customers who believe the lies of the worthless bastards from the Software Engineering Institute that their " process " will make you ship quality software .
XP attempts to establish itself as an alternative legitimate " process " in the realm of suspicious customers and costly vendors .
XP tries to sell commonsense stuff like automated testing to the desperate programmers working on a single - customer product with scarce resources .
XP also tries to sell itself to the customer , relieving the desperate vendor 's programmers from the insane , intolerable overhead of level 5 CMM paralysis .
XP brings hope to dark , wet , stinky corners around the world .
I sincerely think it 's great .
The permanent brain damage of that CMM training course makes me admire XP .
But then there are people who work for product companies and inflict XP upon themselves .
It 's like paying taxes the government does n't ask you to pay .
XP is an alternative to CMM .
You need it if your customer or manager requires you to use a ready - made methodology , out of lack of trust .
If you do n't have that problem , make yourself your own " process " .
You are blessed with an opportunity to just work , and organize your work as you go and as you see fit .
Why " practice " stuff when you can just work ?
How many product companies use CMM , XP or any other ready - made process , and how many make their own process ?
How many successful companies borrow existing " methodologies " without being forced to do so ?
I do n't know the numbers , but my bet is that most of them do n't .
XP and religion
" EMBRACE CHANGE "
This quote is right from the book cover .
" Extreme Programming Explained .
EMBRACE CHANGE . "
Does it freak you out the way it freaks me out ?
Maybe it 's because of the cultural gap created by my Russian origins ?
Nay , I know plenty of English slogans I can relate to .
Say , " Trust a condom " .
Beats " Embrace change " hands - down .
Changes come in two flavors , good and bad .
Should I " embrace " both kinds ?
" Even programmers can be whole people in the real world .
XP is an opportunity to test yourself , to be yourself , to realize that maybe you 've been fine all along and just hanging with the wrong crowd . "
Is this a religious cult or what ?
" The key to XP is integrity , acting in harmony with my true values …
The past five years have been a journey of changing my actual values into those I wanted to hold . "
" Journey " .
Talking about being good .
Do you like hippies ?
I like hippies more than nazis .
I like XP more than CMM .
But IMO the hippie world view and general style is suboptimal .
" With XP , I work to become worthy of respect and offer respect to others .
I 'm content to do my best and strive always to improve .
I hold values I 'm proud of and act in harmony with those values . "
" I have seen people applying XP bring renewed hope to their software development and their lives .
You know enough to get started .
I encourage you to start right now .
Think about your values .
Make conscious choices to live in harmony with them . "
It 's a religion , people .
I 'm not strictly against religion .
I even have vague respect towards religious people , those stating that their purpose in life is to be good and that they know how to do it .
( I similarly respect the intentions and discipline of various development methodology followers . )
Of course when a religious person behaves as an asshole , it 's way more annoying than a secular asshole is , because the latter at least does n't state that he 's all about being good and living right .
( I noticed that many people who love to talk about " proper process " commit the worst atrocities . )
Some religions or sects are awful , to the point of human sacrifices .
( CMM . )
Most modern mainstream religions are kinda nice though , and they promote good Values and Practices , like not killing , not stealing and helping each other .
( XP promotes automated testing , short build , integration and release cycles . )
Many religions have peculiar regulations when it comes to sex .
( XP has The Coupling Practices . )
This is when religious people start to get annoying , to the point of throwing stones at people who are improperly dressed , not to mention engaging in forbidden sexual relationships .
( Refuse to " pair " and XP gets you fired . )
Interestingly enough , the majority of religious people feel much stronger about the peculiar regulations of their religion than the universally recognized atrocities , which are also forbidden by their religion .
They never gather around prisons to throw stones at convicts going on vacation , they are more likely to do so near a gay parade .
( The Senior VP from Kent Beck 's interview did n't recommend firing over lack of tests , which all of us would recognize as a crime ; he recommended firing over the violation of The Coupling Practices . )
And this is when my patience towards religious people evaporates .
So there 's a gay parade .
Got a problem with it ?
Shove it !
I 'm not gay , but the idea of harassing people based on this sort of criteria is disgusting .
( I think I can blend in very well in a team engaging in pair programming and collective ownership , but I know awesome programmers who can't work that way ; just try to get them fired . )
But still , religion is not all bad .
I think that there are religious communities which are less inflicted with drug abuse compared to your average secular community .
( It 's not unlikely that many XP teams have more tests and less bugs than " secular " teams using no " standard " process . )
Few people have the courage and the patience needed to openly attack religion ; in particular , holy scriptures tend to be long and obscure .
( Skim through an XP or especially a CMM book and try to stay awake or find refutable claims . )
Young people who are n't cynical enough to realize that bullshit is free and hence everybody is going to bullshit you if only you let them tend to be an easy target for religions seeking expansion .
( When I started working as a programmer , I was shocked how messy everything was , and cheerfully welcomed every " methodologist " about to create order out of the chaos .
Today , even saying " Best Practice " near me is nor recommended . )
Summary
I treat XP as a religious lifestyle ( true of any methodology ) .
XP is not a bad religion .
Its primary virtue is the threat it poses to the cannibalistic cults such as the CMM .
While I do n't want to be anywhere near XP churches , I think religion is an inevitable attribute of human existence , and as far as religions go , XP is not at all bad .
OAKLAND , California – At Pacific Coast Brewing here , brewer Donald Gortemiller is reworking his recipes and altering his brewing styles like never before .
Gortemiller is n't acting on a spurt of creativity .
He 's coping with a worldwide shortage of hops – the spice of beer .
The dry cones of a particular flowering vine , hops are what give your favorite brew its flavor and aroma .
Prices of the commodity are skyrocketing as hop supplies have plummeted , forcing smaller brewmasters around the United States to begin quietly tweaking their recipes , in ways that are easily discerned by serious imbibers .
The shortage – caused by a dwindling number of hop growers worldwide , and exacerbated by a Yakima , Washington , warehouse fire – has forced Gortemiller to use fewer and different hops than before , changing the flavor of his beer .
He 's also resorted to beer hacks , like " dry hopping , " in which the hops are added late to the mix , consuming fewer hops and yielding a more consistent flavor .
" When hops were $ 2 a pound , compared to $ 20 or $ 30 a pound now , it did n't matter .
We 'd throw them into the boil at various times , " Gortemiller says .
" That was an inaccurate way of doing things .
We 're modifying recipes and using about 20 percent less hops . "

The beer - brewing situation demonstrates how the global - commodity shortage is spilling over to affect diverse industries in unexpected ways .
The hop shortage lives on the outer edges of a food crisis that 's prompted riots across the planet , and last month led U.N. Secretary - General Ban-Ki Moon to implore the world 's governments to increase food production to stave off a 40 percent jump in the cost of staples .
While nobody in the craft - beer industry is going hungry , they are being forced to adapt .
There 's no replacement for hops in beer – they give the brew its flavor .
But other key ingredients are in short supply , as well .
Malt , which comes from sprouted barley , produces the alcohol and body of beer – its prices have doubled along with hops .
The price of rice , used by industrial brewers , has charted a similar course .
The larger commercial brewers are better off .
Most have long - term contracts for hops , barley and rice , and are doing whatever is necessary not to tinker with their brand names .
" Coors Banquet has been tweaked very little since it was introduced in the 1800s , " says Molson Coors spokeswoman Jenny Volanakis .
" We do n't play around with our beers . "
But even the big brewers are n't immune from the shortage , says industry analyst Jack Russo of Edward Jones in St. Louis .
" Most everybody has raised prices in the 2 - to - 3 - percent range , " says Russo .
The small , craft brewers are taking the brunt of the beer crisis , though .
" When I called my hop supplier , " Gortemiller says , " they told me you 're 250th on the list . "
At the 21st Amendment Brewery in San Francisco , brewer Shaun O'Sullivan says he just increased the price of a pint 25 cents , to $ 5.50 .
Like Gortemiller , he 's reducing the amount of hops used in some recipes .
" We 've backed off , " O'Sullivan says .
" We had to get smart .
We could have easily limped along . "
O'Sullivan is lucky .
One of his most popular beers is Watermelon Wheat , which " has virtually no hops in it , " he says .

Ken Grossman , the head brewer at Sierra Nevada Brewing Company in Chico , California , says he's not tinkering with his brand - name recipes , such as his Pale Ale .
He has long - term contracts in place to purchase his hops of choice .
He 's paying more for barley , though – the price has jumped because of a drought in Australia , flooding in Europe and a trend that has farmers worldwide switching to corn to produce biofuels .
" A lot of brewers got caught short on hops , " says Grossman .
Still , that has n't stopped him from brewing a new , hop - laden beer called Torpedo Ale , produced with New Zealand hops .
" We have been in a fortunate position , " Grossman says .
But not everybody in the business is as beer savvy as is Grossman , one of the first to commercialize microbrewing .
Ian Ward , president of Brewers Supply Group in Shakopee , Minnesota – the nation 's largest craft brew supplier – says things are only going to get worse .
" That 's the crisis that brewers are finding themselves in , " Ward says .
" They 're having to review their recipes .
The crisis really has n't hit hard yet . "
The hop shortage became noticeable around July , when a market glut and hop reserves stored in extract began dwindling .
The bulk of U.S. - grown hops are produced in the Yakima , Washington , area .
Farmers were n't getting a profitable return and got out of the market , switched crops or went bankrupt .
The same was happening in Germany , the world 's No. 1 hop - growing country .
In the United States alone , there were an estimated 515 hop growers in 1950 ; 75 in 2000 and just 45 today , Ward says .
In 2006 , about 2 million pounds of hops were destroyed in an S.S. Steiner warehouse in Yakima , equaling about 4 percent of the U.S. hop crop .
All the while , beer sales are increasing worldwide by about 1 to 2 percent annually .
The craft brewing industry is growing yearly by 12 percent .
That economic reality is pushing hop growers back into the fields .
21st Amendment 's Jesse Houck adds hops to the brew .

About 8,500 acres of hops were just planted in Yakima alone , and about 2,500 thousand acres in Germany , Ward says .
" The cure for high prices is high prices , " he says .
But that is n't sitting well with Omar Ansari , the owner and brewer of Surly Brewing in Brooklyn Center , Minnesota , who just signed a long - term hop deal .
" My jaw hit the floor when I saw the price , " Ansari says .
And next year , he 'll have to reformulate his brown ale Bender beer , a blend he described as a " flagship " flavor requiring the " Willamette " hop from the Pacific Northwest .
" We were informed by our supplier that next year we can't get that hop .
It 's just gone , " Ansari said .
" We 're going to have to make changes . "
" Everybody , " he says , " is crossing their fingers there is going to be good hop crop . "
A lot of commenters mentioned this already , but there appears to be a case of plagiarism afoot .
First , look at an excerpt from Rev. Albert Mohler ‘s book Atheism Remix :
Atheism is not a new concept .
Even the Bible speaks of the one who tells himself in his heart , “ There is no God . ”
Atheism became an organized and publicly recognized worldview in the wake of the Enlightenment and has maintained a foothold in Western culture ever since .
Disbelief in God became part of the cultural landscape in the 1960s when TIME magazine published a cover story —
“ Is God Dead ? ” — that seemed to herald the arrival of a new secular age .
And here ’s the first paragraph from an op - ed published a few days ago by Dr. Samuel Krouse in the Colusa County Sun Herald :
Atheism is not new .
The Bible speaks of the one who tells himself in his heart , “ There is no God . ”
Atheism became an organized and publicly recognized worldview in the wake of the Enlightenment and has maintained a foothold in Western culture ever since .
Disbelief in God became part of the cultural landscape in the 1960s when TIME magazine published a cover story – “ Is God Dead ? ” – that seemed to herald the arrival of a new secular age
That looks strangely familiar …
Let ’s do it again .
First , Mohler , from his book :
In the final analysis , the New Atheism presents the Christian church with a great moment of clarification .
The New Atheists do , in the end , understand what they are rejecting .
When Sam Harris defines true religion as that “ where participants ’ avowed belief in a supernatural agent or agents whose approval is to be sought , ” he understands what many mired in confusion do not .
In the end , the existence of the supernatural , self - existent , and self - revealing God is the only starting point for Christian theology .
God possesses all of the perfections revealed in Scripture , or there is no coherent theology presented in the Bible .
The New Atheists are certainly right about one very important thing — it ’s atheism or biblical theism .
There is nothing in between .
And then , Krouse , from his more recent op - ed :
In the final analysis , the New Atheism presents the Christian church with a great moment of clarification .
The New Atheists do , in the end , understand what they are rejecting .

There is nothing in between .
That one ’s word - for - word .
Blatant plagiarism .
With no credit given to Mohler .
From Krouse , the pastor of First Baptist Church of Colusa … and whose contact information is on his church ’s website …
Pathetic .

Intel chips power the majority of the world 's personal computers
European regulators have filed fresh charges against the world 's biggest computer chip maker Intel over alleged abuse of its dominant market position .
The European Commission ( EC ) accused the firm of paying a leading European retailer not to stock products containing chips made by rival AMD .
It is also accused of giving incentives to PC makers to switch to Intel chips .
Intel , which has eight weeks to respond to the allegations , said it was disappointed with the EC 's claims .
The Commission has also accused Intel of paying the PC maker to delay the planned launch of a product containing AMD chips .
' Considerable muscle '
The EC said Intel " used its considerable muscle to provide substantial rebates to a leading European PC retailer - conditional on it selling only Intel - based PCs " .
Intel said in a statement it was disappointed with the Commission 's claims .
" The issuance of a second Statement of Objections suggests that the Commission supports AMD 's position that Intel should be prevented from competing fairly and offering price discounts which have resulted in lower prices for consumers . "
Intel added that " the allegations stem from the same set of complaints that our competitor , AMD , has been making to regulators and courts around the world for more than 10 years " .
The company has eight weeks to respond to the Commission 's three new charges and can seek a hearing in Brussels .
Rebates
It is not the first row between the US technology firm and regulators in Brussels .
In February , EU officials raided Intel 's German office amid claims it abused its market position .
Last summer , the Commission unveiled the initial results of a probe that claimed Intel engaged in anti-competitive action to thwart AMD .
Brussels accused the world 's largest chipmaker of giving rebates to customers provided they bought Intel products and offered incentives to companies to delay or cancel products containing AMD technology .
European regulators have the power to fine Intel up to 10 % of annual turnover if they find it guilty of stifling competition .

Black Republicans consider voting for Obama
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Black conservative talk show host Armstrong Williams has never voted for a Democrat for president .
That could change this year with Barack Obama as the Democratic Party 's nominee .
" I do n't necessarily like his policies ; I do n't like much that he advocates , but for the first time in my life , history thrusts me to really seriously think about it , " Williams said .
" I can honestly say I have no idea who I 'm going to pull that lever for in November .
And to me , that 's incredible . "
Just as Obama has touched black Democratic voters , he has engendered conflicting emotions among black Republicans who are far fewer in numbers .
They revel over the possibility of a black president but wrestle with the thought that Obama does not sit beside them ideologically .
" Among black conservatives , " Williams said , " they tell me privately , it would be very hard to vote against him in November . "
Perhaps sensing the possibility of such a shift , Republican presidential candidate John McCain has made some efforts to lure black voters .
He recently told Essence magazine that he would attend the annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , a leading civil rights group , next month , and he noted that he recently traveled to Selma , Alabama , scene of seminal voting rights protests in the 1960s , and " talked about the need to include ' forgotten Americans . " '
Still , McCain has a tall order in winning black votes , no doubt made taller by running against a black opponent .
In 2004 , blacks chose Democrat John Kerry over President George W. Bush by an 88 % to 11 % margin , according to exit polls .
J.C. Watts , a former Oklahoma congressman who once was part of the Republican House leadership , said he is thinking of voting for Obama .
Watts said he is still a Republican , but he criticizes his party for neglecting the black community .
Black Republicans , he said , have to concede that while they might not agree with Democrats on issues , at least that party reaches out to them .
" And Obama highlights that even more , " Watts said , adding that he expects Obama to take on issues such as poverty and urban policy .
" Republicans often seem indifferent to those things . "
Likewise , retired Gen. Colin Powell , who became the country 's first black secretary of state under President George W. Bush , said both candidates are qualified and that he will not necessarily vote for the Republican .
" I will vote for the individual I think that brings the best set of tools to the problems of 21st - century America and the 21st - century world regardless of party , regardless of anything else other than the most qualified candidate , " Powell said Thursday in Vancouver in comments reported by The Globe and Mail in Toronto .
Writer and actor Joseph C. Phillips got so excited about Obama earlier this year that he started calling himself an " Obamacan " — Obama Republican .
Phillips , who appeared on " The Cosby Show " as Denise Huxtable 's husband , Navy Lt. Martin Kendall , said he has wavered since , but he is still thinking about voting for Obama .
" I am wondering if this is the time where we get over the hump , where an Obama victory will finally , at long last , move us beyond some of the old conversations about race , " Phillips said .
" That possibly , just possibly , this great country can finally be forgiven for its original sin , or find some absolution . "
Yet Phillips , author of the book " He Talk Like a White Boy , " realizes the irony of voting for a candidate based on race to get beyond race .
" We have to not judge him based on his race , but on his desirability as a political candidate , " he said .
" And based on that , I have a lot of disagreements with him on a lot of issues .
I go back and forth . "
Michael Steele , the Republican former lieutenant governor of Maryland who lost a Senate race there in 2006 , said he is proud of Obama as a black man , but that " come November , I will do everything in my power to defeat him . "
Electing Obama , he said , would not automatically solve the woes of the black community .
" I think people who try to put this sort of messianic mantle on Barack 's nomination are a little bit misguided , " he said .
John McWhorter , a self - described political moderate who is a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a New York Sun columnist , said Obama 's Democratic Party victory " proves that while there still is some racism in the United States , there is not enough to matter in any serious manner .
This is a watershed moment . "
" Obama is probably more to the left than I would prefer on a lot of issues , " he adds .
" But this issue of getting past race for real is such a wedge issue for me .
And he is so intelligent , and I think he would be a perfectly competent president , that I 'm for him .
I want him to get in because , in a way , it will put me out of a job . "
James T. Harris , a Milwaukee radio talk show host and public speaker , said he opposes Obama " with love in my heart . "
" We are of the same generation .
He 's African American and I 'm an American of African descent .
We both have lovely wives and beautiful children , " Harris said .
" Other than that , we 've got nothing in common .
I hope he loses every state . "
Moderate Republican Edward Brooke , who blazed his own trail in Massachusetts in 1966 as the first black popularly elected U.S. senator , said he is " extremely proud and confident and joyful " to see Obama ascend .
Obama sent Brooke a signed copy of his book , inscribed , " Thank you for paving the way , " and Brooke sent his own signed book to Obama , calling the presumed Democratic nominee " a worthy bearer of the torch . "
Brooke , who now lives in Florida , wo n't say which candidate will get his endorsement , but he does say that race wo n't be a factor in his decision .
" This is the most important election in our history , " Brooke said .
" And with the world in the condition that it is , I think we 've got to get the best person we can get . "
Williams , the commentator , says his 82 - year - old mother , who also has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate , has already made up her mind .
" She is so proud of Senator Barack Obama , and she has made it clear to all of us that she 's voting for him in November , " Williams relates .
" That is historic .
Every time I call her , she asks , ' How 's Obama doing ? '
They feel as if they are a part of this .
Because she said , given the history of this country , she never thought she 'd ever live to see this moment . "

Young people entering the world of work today live less well than preceding generations -- and think more radically about the world around them .
Adam Turl examines the evidence and the reasons for it .
MOST YOUNG people are entering a world of work today that would be unrecognizable to previous generations .
Over the past three decades , the U.S. working class has been twisted and stretched by corporations seeking to expand profits .
American business has created a lower - wage , low - benefit , " flexible " labor market -- and young workers today are bearing the brunt of the impact that falls most heavily on those at the bottom end .
This is another nail in the coffin of the " American Dream . "
One of the central ideas of the American Dream was that each new generation -- even if its individual members were unable to climb far up the economic ladder -- would at least live modestly better lives than the one that came before .
Not anymore .
By virtually every measure -- wages , conditions , debt , unemployment and more -- young working people today are less well off than previous generations .
But that is only part of the story .
As a result of these lowered living standards , there is also a pool of bitterness and a desire for something different within Generation Debt -- ingredients that hold out the hope of building an opposition that demands a better world for them and future generations .
ACCORDING TO a study by the progressive think tank Demos , on every indicator , young workers face nothing short of an historic catastrophe in wages , living conditions , health care coverage , levels of debt , pensions , unemployment , imprisonment , workplace stability and union rights .
In 1975 , the median annual income for 25 - to 34 - year - old male workers was $ 43,416 ( measured in 2004 dollars , adjusted for inflation ) .
By 2005 , it had fallen to $ 35,100 .
Women 's average annual income increased slightly , but still stood at $ 30,300 in 2005 -- and for women workers with some college education ( who attended college , but did n't graduate ) or only a high school diploma , annual median income actually declined .
Among African Americans , the median annual income for Black workers , men and women , between the ages of 25 and 34 stood at a mere $ 23,836 .
But the crisis for young workers goes way beyond income .
The precipitous decline in young workers ' income has led to a pooling of youth poverty .
In 2006 , the poverty rate -- as measured by the government 's official poverty line , which undercounts the real ranks of the poor -- was 12.3 percent overall , or about one in every eight Americans .
But for 18 - to 24 - year - olds , the poverty rate stood at 17.8 percent , or one in every six .
Young workers , taken as a group , enter the workforce at the lowest levels and are therefore among the first to be let go in " hard times " and corporate restructuring schemes -- leading to much higher unemployment .
In 2007 - - before the onset of the current economic slump -- unemployment for male workers between the ages of 18 and 24 stood at 8.7 percent , well above the overall unemployment rate of around 5 percent .
About 7.3 percent of female 18 - to 24 - year - olds were unemployed .
Among African Americans in the same age bracket , 16.9 percent of young Black men and 13.6 percent of young Black women were out of work .
Then there 's employment benefits -- like health care and employer - provided pensions -- which are quickly becoming the stuff of past legend for entry - level workers .
According to the Economic Policy Institute ( EPI ) , in 1979 , 63.4 percent of recent high school graduates got employer - provided health insurance upon entering the workforce .
By 2004 , this had been cut in half to 33.7 percent .
For college graduates , in 1979 , 77.7 percent received employer - provided health coverage -- by 2004 , only 62.5 percent did .
Among 47 million Americans without health insurance ( at last count in 2006 ) , two out of five are young workers between the ages of 18 and 29 .
One - third of all Black workers aged 18 to 29 and one - half of Latino workers in this age bracket do n't have health insurance .
The percentage of high school graduates entering the workforce who will get an employer - provided pension plans has dropped in half in the past quarter century , from 36 percent in 1979 to 18.8 percent in 2004 .
For college graduates entering the labor force , employer - provided pension plans have fallen from 54.6 percent to 49.3 percent .
The concessions of the past are accumulating into a disaster for younger workers , creating a social crisis on other fronts .
One is housing .
Inflation in housing costs has created yet another drain on young workers ' incomes -- and because incomes are lower , an increasing portion of wages would go toward rent anyway .
In 1970 , 18 percent of 25 - to 34 - year - olds spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent .
By 2005 , this had risen to 43 percent .
And when the economic vice grip on young workers proves too much , there 's always prison .
Of the over 2 million people in U.S. prisons and jails today , 1.1 million are between the age of 18 and 34 .
About 31 percent of young prisoners are white , 42 percent are Black , and 24 percent are Latino .
Young workers who try to make up for their declining prospects have only a couple options : debt ( primarily credit cards and college loans ) and education ( to become more skilled for the labor market ) .
Two - thirds of students now borrow money to pay for tuition -- whether they attend private universities , four - year state schools or community and city colleges -- compared to less than half of students in 1993 .
Students today graduate with an average debt of $ 19,200 - - which means their initial entry into the labor market is a kind of latter - day indentured servitude .
One in four graduates have student debts in excess of $ 25,000 .
Part of the reason for the growth in debt is the rising cost of education .
In 1976 - 77 , average tuition and fees at a public four - year university was $ 2,192 ( in 2006 dollars , adjusted back through time for inflation ) .
By 2004 - 2005 , this had more than doubled to an average of $ 5,836 .
Nevertheless , a large majority of high school graduates enroll in college - - up from 50.7 percent in 1975 to 68.6 percent in 2005 .
As a result of swelling enrollment and rising tuition costs -- not to mention financial speculation -- there has been a boom in the private student loan industry , which grew by more than seven - fold between 1994 - 1995 and 2004 - 2005 .
The private student loan industry is characterized by higher interest rates and worsening loan conditions , such as less flexible payment plans .
The variable interest rate on an average private student loan is 11.5 percent , whereas federal loans have a fixed rate below 7 percent .
Tuition and the prospect of being burdened with a mountain of debt is steadily restricting access to higher education .
Despite all the talk about the increased need for college in order to " compete " in the " new global economy , " the number of people aged 25 to 29 who received a bachelor 's degree or higher has increased only slightly ( to 28 percent ) , even though the number of college freshmen has grown substantially .
In other words , a large number of people simply cannot afford to finish school -- certainly not in four years .
When it comes to making up for declining incomes , young workers -- like older ones -- have turned to credit cards .
Average credit card debt for 18 - to 24 - year - olds is 11 percent higher than for the same age bracket in 1989 .
For the next age range , credit card debt for 25 - to 34 - year - olds was 47 percent higher than in 1989 .
With increasing use of credit cards and loans comes increasing sums of money that go to interest and fees -- in other words , into the coffers of the banks .
In 2004 , 25 - to 34 - year - olds spent an average of 25 cents of every dollar to make payments on debt .
For those aged 18 to 24 , the fraction of income going to debt payments rose from 13 percent in 1989 to 22 percent in 2004 .
Almost one - fifth of those in this age bracket reported spending more than 40 percent of their income on debt in 2004 .
In 2005 , according to the Demos study , the average indebted person under the age of 34 had more than $ 8,000 in credit card debt , and the most common causes for these debt were sudden unemployment , home repairs and car repairs .
More than one - third of indebted young people reported using credit cards for mortgage payments , rent , food , utilities or similar expenses .
So young workers were already facing hard times .
Now , with the housing and food crisis underway and the economy likely already in recession , they face worse times to come .
The New York Times reported last month that teenagers faced the worse summer job market since the federal government began keeping records in 1948 .
Just over a third of 16 - to 19 - year - olds is expected to find employment this summer .
And , of course , this is n't a matter of " pocket money " for middle - class kids to party and hang out at the mall .
More and more teenagers have gone into the labor market to help supplement overall household income .
In other words , teenagers are working to help pay rent and mortgages , and buy food and fuel -- and they can't find work .
TODAY'S GENERATION of young workers was raised entirely after the decline of the " American Dream " that began in late 1970s and ' 80s .
It is projected to number nearly 100 million in all .
It is multiracial - - 40 percent of those aged 18 to 29 are Black , Latino and Asian .
It is also the most politically progressive generation in decades -- in particular , around economic justice issues .
A study by the Center for American Progress ( CAP ) outlines point by point how a majority of 18 - to 29 - year - olds -- known in the report as " Millennials " - - reject the idea that " big government " is always the problem and the " free market " can solve social and economic ills .
According to the CAP study , 57 percent of Millennials believe health care should be provided by the government .
Almost 90 percent think the government should spend more on health care , even if higher taxes are needed to provide the funds .
This is the highest affirmative response to the question in the 20 years it has been asked .
Millennials are the second most pro-union age group ( of any age group ) in 40 years .
More than 90 percent want higher education funding , even if this requires a tax increase .
Over 60 percent think the government should provide more social services in general .
Other studies show that these progressive views are n't limited to economic questions .
A majority of young people support equal marriage rights for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people .
More than 90 percent approve of interracial marriage .
And as the Demos study shows , they are more likely to vote and attend political meetings than any generation of young people in decades .
An October 2006 Harvard Institute of Politics survey of 18 - to 24 - year - olds showed that 60 percent of people thought political engagement is effective in solving problems facing the country .
No one can predict the exact trajectory of political consciousness among these young workers .
But it is obvious that the political ground is shifting dramatically in U.S. society .
A new generation of workers -- inheriting the bitter legacy of neoliberalism and social conservatism -- wants the things that were taken away from past generations .
It is a generation with increasingly little left to lose -- and a world to win .
The health insurance system in the United States works great , as long as you stay healthy .
It 's only people who need medical care who have problems .
The basic story is that however bad the system might look on paper – we pay twice as much per person as people do in other wealthy countries , yet have worse health outcomes , and still have 47 million people without insurance - it is much worse in practice .
Let 's start at the most basic level .
You go to the doctor , paying directly , and then send your bill to the insurance company for reimbursement .
The insurance company sends you a form letter rejecting the claim .
It happens all the time .
Persistent people call their insurer and demand to know the reason the claim was rejected .
The insurer gives you a form that your doctor must fill out .
After the doctor returns the form , the insurer still has not paid the bill .
Very persistent people call the insurer and demand to know the reason the claim was rejected .
The insurer tells you that they never received the form from the doctor .
Under protest , the doctor is persuaded to fill out the form again , but the bill is still not paid .
Extremely persistent people call the insurer and demand to know the reason the claim was rejected .
The insurer tells you that the doctor filled out the wrong form .
OK , my wife and I actually enjoyed this set of exchanges with our insurer .
At the end of the day , we got them the form they wanted and were reimbursed as provided under our plan .
But , we are extremely persistent , well - educated people who know our rights under the insurance contract .
Suppose the denial had gone to someone who is not very well educated , speaks poor English or does not have the physical or mental wherewithal to fight back ?
That person might just have assumed that the insurance company was right to turn down their claim and not contested the issue .
Or , if they contested it once , they might have let it drop after the first round or the second .
From the standpoint of the insurance company , the denial of a claim is almost a no - brainer .
For the price of a letter , they can save themselves reimbursements that can run into the thousands of dollars .
In the worst case , they encounter persistent people who demand that the company honour its contract .
In that case , they only end up paying what they would have shelled out in the first place and make money on the float until they do .
They do n't face any fines or penalties for wrongly denying claims .
Insurers do n't generally give out the basis under which they deny claims .
Nor do they generally reveal how often they deny claims .
How can a person intelligently decide between insurers if they do n't even know how likely they are to see a claim denied ?
This is not the only information that you wo n't get from your insurer .
In most plans , when people go " out of network " , insurers reimburse an amount that is 70 - 80 % of the " reasonable and customary " rate .
Typically your insurer will not disclose in advance their customary and usual rate , so patients will not know how much a trip to the doctor will actually cost them until after the doctor submits the claim .
In addition , the insurer is free to change their reimbursement rate at its own discretion .
It can also , at its own discretion , change what procedures are and are not covered .
The current law basically gives insurers a free hand to abuse patients .
It is equivalent to handing over a $ 12,000 check to a contractor to repair the plumbing and electric in your house and then leaving it to the contractor to decide which repairs they want to do .
A contractor that fixed a few pipes and then skipped out would be prosecuted for fraud .
An insurance company that effectively did the same thing , by denying care to policyholders , would be paying big bonuses to the CEO .
The next president must have healthcare reform at the top of the domestic agenda .
Reform should provide subsidies that make healthcare affordable to all .
It should also offer a public insurance option modelled on Medicare that everyone can buy into .
Unlike private insurance , the public Medicare plan has predictable costs and benefits .
You can see virtually any doctor , and Medicare reimburses the doctor directly , protecting you from needing to pay upfront .
In fact , if your claim is denied , it is your doctor who is financially liable unless you are warned in advance that Medicare will not pay .
Reform should also include more balanced regulation of the private insurance system .
Insurers should be forced to disclose the treatments they cover and under what circumstances , as well as their full schedule of fees .
They should be limited in their ability to change the terms of their coverage , and they should be publicly accountable for the conditions under which and the frequency with which they deny claims .
Most businesses do n't get to write their own rules .
There is no reason to make an exception for insurers , especially since they typically are dealing with people with serious health problems , the most vulnerable segment of the population .
Flachbildschirme als Belohnung für die Verschreibung von Medikamenten : Gegen diese Praxis hat die Staatsanwaltschaft Aachen ein Ermittlungsverfahren eingeleitet .
Im Fadenkreuz : der Pharmakonzern Trommsdorf .
stern .de wirft ein Blick hinter die Kulissen .
Von Markus Grill
Das Angebot war verlockend : Für fünf Patienten bekamen die Ärzte einen Flachbildschirm , für 12 Patienten eine Espressomaschine , für 18 einen Laptop .
So großzügig zeigte sich die Pharmafirma Trommsdorff , wenn Ärzte bereit waren , ihren Blutdrucksenker Emestar ihren Patienten zu verordnen .
Nun hat die Staatsanwaltschaft Aachen nach Informationen von stern .de die Firma Trommsdorff durchsucht und ein Ermittlungsverfahren eingeleitet .
Die nördlich von Aachen gelegene Pharmafirma beschäftigt rund 240 Mitarbeiter und macht die Hälfte ihres Geschäfts mit der Behandlung von Herzkrankheiten .
Nach Angaben der Staatsanwaltschaft handelt es sich um ein " umfangreiches Verfahren " bei dem Anfang dieses Jahres ein Team bei der Polizei gebildet worden sei , das sich ausschließlich mit dem Fall Trommsdorff beschäftige .
Bisher richten sich die Ermittlungen lediglich gegen Verantwortliche der Pharmafirma , die im Verdacht stehen , Anstiftung zu Untreue gegenüber den Krankenkassen begangen zu haben .
Ins Visier der Ermittler könnten aber auch bundesweit rund 1000 Ärzte gelangen , wenn sie Geld und Elektroartikel in Empfang genommen haben .
Bei den Zuwendungen an die Ärzte handle es sich " größtenteils um Sachleistungen " wie die Staatsanwaltschaft mitteilt , die Leistungen betrügen pro Arzt bis zu 1500 Euro .
Zweifelhafte Studien , um den Absatz anzukurbeln
Trommsdorff hatte den Ärzten die Elektroartikel als Gegenleistung für die Teilnahme an Anwendungsbeobachtungen ( AWB ) für die Blutdrucksenker Emestar mono und Emestar plus in den Jahren 2004 bis 2007 angeboten .
Bei AWBs handelt es sich oftmals um zweifelhafte Studien , die vor allem dazu da sind , den Absatz bestimmter Medikamente anzukurbeln .
Die Ärzte füllen dabei pro Patient , dem sie das Präparat verordnen , ein Formular aus , in dem beschrieben werden soll , wie der Patient das Präparat verträgt .
Für die ausgefüllten Formulare interessieren sich die meisten Unternehmen aber gar nicht , wie eine Studie der kassenärztlichen Bundesvereinigung ergeben hat .
Im Fall Trommsdorff mussten die Ärzte bei der " Anwendungsbeobachtung Emestar " sogar auf dem Deckblatt nur noch ankreuzen , was sie als Gegenleistung erhalten wollten : - Für 5 Patienten : Flachbildschirm 17 Zoll oder iPod mini - Für 7 Patienten : Flachbildschirm 19 Zoll oder DVD Recorder oder All - in - one - Drucker - Für 12 Patienten : Espressomaschine Jura Impressa - Für 14 Patienten : Navigationssystem Tom Tom Go 300 oder DVD Recorder mit Festplatte - Für 18 Patienten : Laptop oder Beamer oder PC +
Drucker oder PC + Flachbildschirm .
Emestar nur bei ACE - Unverträglichkeit sinnvoll
Dabei ist der Blutdrucksenker Emestar nach Einschätzung von Pharmaexperten nur bei Patienten sinnvoll , die die Wirkstoffgruppe der ACE - Hemmer nicht vertragen , weil sie davon Husten bekommen .
Hinsichtlich der eigentlichen " Verhinderung koronarer Ereignisse " sei bei der Gruppe , zu der Emestar gehöre , aber " sogar eine Unterlegenheit wahrscheinlich " ( Arzneiverordnungsreport 2007 , Seite 207 ) .
Allerdings ist Emestar rund zehnmal so teuer wie etwa ein günstiger ACE - Hemmer - umso nötiger war es womöglich , die Ärzte auf ganz besondere Weise von dem Präparat zu überzeugen .
Firmeninterne Dokumente legen nahe , dass Trommsdorff außerdem die Vergütung der Ärzte in Form einer " Fondsorientierten Privatvorsorge für Ärzte " zumindest geplant hat .
Die Frage , wie vielen Ärzten eine solche " Privatvorsorge " angeboten wurde beziehungsweise mit wie vielen Ärzten ein diesbezüglicher " Beratervertrag " geschlossen wurde , wollte Trommsdorff - Geschäftsführerin Bettina Freischütz gegenüber stern .de nicht beantworten .
Auch zum Ermittlungsverfahren und den Details der Ärztehonorierung mochte Trommsdroff keine Stellung nehmen .
PHOENIX , Arizona ( CNN ) -- Vice President Dick Cheney defended the Bush administration 's record on prisoner interrogations , telling a veterans ' group that its use of " alternative " techniques against suspects was legal and proper .
Vice President Dick Cheney , in June with President Bush , says torture at Abu Ghraib was " the misdeeds of a few . "
" No nation in the world takes human rights more seriously than the United States , " Cheney said at the American Legion 's annual convention .
" The policies of our country comply with our law , which prohibits torture .
We 're proud of our country and what it stands for .
We expect all who serve America to conduct themselves with honor , and we enforce the rules . "
President Bush acknowledged in 2006 that top operatives of the al Qaeda terrorist movement had been held in CIA custody and subjected to what he called " alternative " interrogation techniques .
One was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the admitted mastermind of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people .
Cheney said the CIA program involved " tough customers and tough interrogations , " but said the information obtained from prisoners prevented attacks and saved American lives .
Although Americans were " rightly outraged " by the 2004 revelations of Iraqis being abused and tortured by U.S. troops at Iraq 's Abu Ghraib prison , he said , people who broke the law in that case were punished .
" The misdeeds of a few should never be used to slander the good and decent Americans who go to work every day to keep our country safe , " Cheney said .
The White House has consistently denied that the United States practices torture , but CIA officials have admitted to using at least one technique -- " waterboarding " -- that has been considered a war crime in the past .
Top Bush administration officials , including Cheney lawyer David Addington , were involved in drafting the legal justification for those techniques , a former aide to Secretary of State Colin Powell told a congressional committee in June .
Critics , including the American Civil Liberties Union , decry waterboarding as torture and have demanded a stop to it .
Some in Congress also have criticized waterboarding as a violation of the Geneva Conventions that could imperil U.S. soldiers should they ever be captured .

Oh mummy !
Archaeologists unearth ancient tribe members sacrificed 1,300 years ago
Piercing blue eyes undimmed by the passing of 1,300 years , this is the Lady of the Mask – a mummy whose discovery could reveal the secrets of a lost culture .
She was found by archaeologists excavating a pyramid in Peru ’s capital city Lima ,
alongside two other adult mummies and the sacrificial remains of a child .
It is the first time a tomb from the region ’s Wari culture has been discovered intact and gives historians the chance to pin down exactly how the pre-Incas buried their dead .
Archaeologists have uncovered this mummy and three others belonging to the ancient Wari culture in Peru
The mummy - assumed to be a noblewoman because of the ornate mask - was found in a crouching position surrounded by ceramics and textiles associated with female weavers .
“ Her face startled me at first , ” said 19 - year - old Miguel Angel , one of the workers who carried her body out of the tomb .
“ I was n’t expecting to find anything like that . ”
Earlier in the week , workers at the Huaca Pucllana site removed two adult mummies found lying near the lady of the mask .
Researchers gently lift the well - preserved mummy from the tomb
The mummy is believed to be more than 1,300 years old
Archaeologists have been excavating the area for three years and while they found plenty of artefacts , the 30 other tombs uncovered had been looted .
The Wari , who came from Peru ’s southern highlands and ruled a vast area of the country from 500 to 1000 AD , conducted multiple burials and sent their loved ones into the afterlife with provisions and the tools of their trade .
“ We ’d discovered other tombs before , ” Isabel Flores , the dig ’s director , said .
“ But they always had holes or were damaged .
Never had we found a whole tomb like this one – intact .
“ The sacrifices were very common , particularly of children and young girls .
They were part of their ritual offerings to the sea and the land . ”
An archaeologist take notes at the tomb which was uncovered at the Huaca Pucllana ruins in Lima
Scientists also discovered the remains of a child as well as an assortment of artefacts
Two other masks were found near the bodies but the archaeologists believe the blue - eyed mummy was the only important woman among the dead .
“ The mask had very firm eyes , they seemed very strong , and it shocked the workers as much as the archaeologists , ” Ms Flores said .
Tests are being carried out on the other adult mummies to find out what sex they are but Ms Flores said identifying the noblewoman ’s gender was relatively simple .
When in good condition , Wari tombs can be identified by the ceramic and textile offerings placed around the dead .
Small children were often sacrificed and it is common to find their bodies alongside adult ones .
Archaeologists said the child discovered with the adult mummies at Huaca Pucllana was most likely sacrificed .
The discovery confirms the Wari people buried their dead in what is now Lima and offers a more complete picture of how burials were carried out .
Enlarge By Evan Vucci , AP President Bush , left , and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda arrive for a press conference Sunday at the lakeside resort of Toyako , Japan .
TOYAKO , Japan  President Bush on Sunday defended his decision to attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games next month , saying that skipping the event " would be an affront to the Chinese people . "
Bush said that he " does n't need the Olympics to express my concerns " about China 's human rights record , something he said he has consistently done in past meetings with Chinese leaders .
In Beijing next month , he intends to cheer on U.S. athletes .
" It 's an athletic event , " he said .
Bush made the comments in a press conference here with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda on the eve of the annual Group of Eight summit of industrialized nations .
Fukuda also ended speculation by declaring that he would attend the Aug. 8 opening of the Games .
Some human rights groups have called for world leaders to boycott the ceremony to protest China 's repression of dissidents and its support for pariah states Burma and Sudan .
" You do n't have to link the Olympics to politics , " Fukuda said .
" I would not like the Chinese to become unhappy .
We are neighbors , after all . "
Meeting in a resort on the northern Japanese island Hokkaido , the leaders of the G8 nations — the United States , Japan , Great Britain , France , Germany , Russia , Canada and Italy — will work through a packed three - day agenda covering topics such as : • Global warming • Soaring energy and food prices • Economic uncertainty following the collapse of the U.S. housing market •
The nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran • Aid for Africa Fukuda hopes to use the G8 summit to broker a deal to reduce by 50 % worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 .
Bush has balked at the idea , believing that any G8 agreement to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases — which trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming — would be meaningless unless emerging economic powerhouses China and India sign on , too .
" The president 's trying to shift the blame to developing countries , " says Alden Meyer , policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists , a non-profit environmental group .
Meyer said that China and India have already signaled at a climate change conference in Indonesia , last December that they 're willing to accept emissions - cutting targets .
" On the topic of climate change , this year will be a place - holder summit , " William Antholis , managing director of the Brookings Institution think tank , predicted .
Antholis said that U.S. presidential contenders Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama were more committed than Bush to stopping global warming .
When a new U.S. president meets G8 leaders again in Italy next year , he said , " industrial nations may finally step up to the global challenge of cutting emissions . "
In an hour - long meeting Sunday afternoon , Bush , who was celebrating his 62nd birthday , sought to reassure Fukuda on another issue sensitive in Japan : the abduction by North Korea of at least 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s .
Last month , the United States removed North Korea from a list of countries that sponsor terrorism — a reward for Pyongyang 's progress toward dismantling its nuclear weapons program .
The decision was widely criticized in Japan , which wants to see North Korea pressured into accounting for the missing Japanese .
" As a father of little girls , I can't imagine what it would be like to have my daughter just disappear , " Bush said .
He said he told Fukuda " the United States will not abandon you on this issue . "

TWO FORMER GOP CONGRESSMEN TO U.S. COMBAT FORCES WORLDWIDE : MCCAIN UNFIT TO SERVE AS YOUR COMMANDER-IN -CHIEF
Ex -Reps . Warn Troops : As Senator He Abandoned American POWs Trapped in Indochina ; as President He'll Abandon You
By
Bill Hendon & John LeBoutillier
Ed. note :
This message from former U.S. Congressmen Bill Hendon ( R - NC ) and John LeBoutillier ( R - NY ) is being posted today on numerous military blogs and websites .
~~~~~~~~~~
He [ McCain ] has told me several times over the years that the myth of live POWs was a cruel hoax on the families .
He chaired hearings into the issue in the 1990s and found nothing .
“ The committee … pored over thousands of records and every claim of a sighting , no matter how outlandish , ” says Salter .
“ It was all untrue . ”
Jonathan Alter , When Ross Perot Calls ... , Newsweek.com January 16 , 2008
Senator John McCain 's heroic and inspiring wartime service in Vietnam notwithstanding , we know from personal experience he is not fit to serve as Commander - in - Chief of America 's armed forces .
Here is how we know this :
In mid-summer 1991 , the U.S. Senate created the Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs and charged it with conducting a no-holds - barred investigation into the long - festering matter of American POWs reportedly still held captive by the Communist North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao .
On the day the legislation creating the Select Committee was passed , August 2 , a Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll conducted nationwide showed that 69 % of Americans surveyed believed that Americans were still held captive in Southeast Asia and 75 % believed the U.S. government was n’t doing enough to get them home .
Following months of negotiations between the committee and a very reluctant George H. W. Bush administration , committee intelligence investigators were finally able to obtain the postwar intelligence files relating to live POWs .
Committee investigators spent some 2,700 man hours vetting , analyzing and crosschecking the postwar intelligence .
They found it a textbook blend of human intelligence ( HUMINT ) ; intercepts of secret enemy radio traffic ( SIGINT ) , and images taken by unmanned reconnaissance drones and U.S. spy satellites ( IMINT ) .
The committee 's intelligence investigators told the senators that collectively the intelligence indicated the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao had held back hundreds of POWs at Operation Homecoming in 1973 and that many were still alive in captivity during the late 1980 ’s and early 1990’s .
By the time committee investigators finally began briefing the senators in secret sessions in early spring , 1992 , the issue of live POWs had become , as McCain later described it , " white hot ; " this not only because of intense public interest in the plight of the POWs , but also because Texas businessman and longtime POW advocate H. Ross Perot had entered the presidential race , and had done so amid press accounts that he thought President Bush was not doing enough to bring the POWs home .
By late May Perot was in first place in the national polls , ahead of President Bush , who was in second place , and the presumptive Democratic nominee , Governor Bill Clinton , who was in third .
What would the committee find ?
Might a ruling that 69 % of the American people were right and that , in fact , there were live POWs still held half a world away throw the election to Perot ?
How could it not ?
Enter John McCain .
Given his wartime experiences as a POW in Vietnam , Sen. John McCain was by default the most powerful and influential member of the Select Committee .
Members on both sides of the aisle deferred to his judgment ; reporters hung on his every pronouncement .
And so when McCain , his chief of staff Mark Salter and their allies on the Select Committee joined forces with top Bush administration officials to assail , ridicule , attack , discredit , photoshop , retouch , manipulate , massage and / or “ cherry - pick ” the intelligence in order to destroy its intelligence value and keep the matter of live POWs from becoming an issue in the 1992 election , the live POWs never had a chance .
How McCain and Salter and the others went about doing this is a case study in how powerful government officials can manipulate intelligence to make it say what they want it to say - and the main reason we believe that John McCain must not be Commander - in - Chief of our armed forces .
During that spring and summer of 1992 , McCain and the other members of the committee were briefed on some 925 HUMINT reports the investigators had deemed plausible , credible .
These intelligence reports were some of the several thousand reports the U.S. government had received from human sources who testified they had personally observed or had been told or had otherwise learned about American servicemen in captivity after Operation Homecoming .
Many of the reports corroborated one another as to location , time and circumstance , e.g. , independent sources repeatedly reported seeing American POWs being held in the same area ; in the same town or village , and / or at the exact same prison at the same time or over a period of time – and , of course , absent IMINT and / or SIGINT , corroboration by independent human sources is the best lie detector ever devised by man .
But what did McCain and Salter make of this crucial intelligence ?
Not one of these reports of American POWs held prisoner after Operation Homecoming was credible , they loudly declared ; instead , all 925 sources were either ( 1 ) lying , or ( 2 ) confused about what he or she had actually seen .
Not one report , McCain and Salter declared , related to American POWs trapped in Indochina after Operation Homecoming .
The SIGINT – the half - dozen or so postwar intercepts of secret Pathet Lao radio transmissions where the PL were heard describing how , when , where and / or why they were holding and / or moving American POWs from one point to another inside their country - got the same treatment .
When analyzed carefully by committee intelligence investigators and cross-checked with the HUMINT , it was clear these postwar radio intercepts alone collectively described the confinement and / or movement of well over 100 American POWs inside Laos .
McCain ’s and Salter ’s ruling ?
Same as with the POWs described in the HUMINT , “ nothing to any of it .
All radio intercepts are false . "
Finally came the IMINT – the priceless postwar satellite images showing missing pilots ' names , their official secret four - digit authenticators , secret USAF / USN escape and evasion ( E&E ) codes given to them and / or other “ I ’m alive , get me the hell out of here ” messages our men had laid out on the ground in hopes U.S. spy satellites would image their plea and rescue forces would be dispatched - and the similar , shocking result .
A missing USAF flight officer ’s name along with a valid USAF / USN escape and evasion code imaged in a field adjacent to a prison in northern Vietnam on June 5 , 1992 – photoshopped right out of the image , disappeared , gone !
Nineteen four - digit authenticators matching those of missing airmen imaged in rice paddies along Route 4 in northern Laos - similarly photoshopped right out of the satellite image !
The name of another USAF pilot and four digit number laid out beside a jungle road in northern Laos - " naturally occurring shadows on the ground , " they said .
A valid E&E code followed by the four - digit authenticator of another USAF flight officer in a field adjacent to a prison in northern Vietnam – “ natural shadings in the field … not man -made intentional signals . ”
The letters " USA , " each 12 feet tall and together stretching over 37 feet across , and below them a huge 24 foot tall by 19 feet across valid secret USAF / USN E&E code imaged in a rice paddy in northern Laos - " a young Laotian boy 's handiwork that he had copied off an envelope , " McCain and Salter " explained " in McCain 's 2002 memoir Worth the Fighting For .
And on and on it went .
( See two versions of map of Indochina showing the 925 postwar HUMINT reports [ pins color - coded by DOI ] and how they cluster and corroborate one another , and the postwar SIGINT and IMINT hits [ yellow squares ] at http://www.thepowerhour.com/news3/maps_bill_hendon.htm ) .
Also see An Enormous Crime , cover photo and Chapter 31 , " 1992 , The Fragging . "
John McCain could have saved these men but chose not to .
For that reason - and because one can photoshop pleas for help out of desert sand and / or rocky , mountain terrain just as easily as one can photoshop them out of jungle terrain , fields and rice paddies - he must not be accorded the highest and most sacred of all honors - that of serving as Commander - in - Chief of America 's armed forces .

Danica Patrick and Milka Duno Spar on Pit Road ( Video , Photos )
was hot under the collar after the Saturday morning practice for the Honda Indy 200 .
The Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course was this weeks venue and Danica went gunning for Venezuelan racer and former modelafter she refused to let faster cars pass her during the practice session .
Patrick was revved up for a hot confrontation when Duno surprised her by snapping a towel repeatedly in her face .
This seemed to take the spit fire by surprise and set her back on her heels .
This is the second time recently that Patrick let her temper boil over .
The last time was during the Indianapolis 500 , when she was stopped by race officials before she could confront driver Ryan Briscoe .
Bob Margolis of Yahoo Sports recently wrote that " Danica 's drama queen theatrics have worn thin . "
We 've got photos of Danica below .

If , as I do , you believe that the writings of the Weekly Standardâ€™s Stephen Hayes reflect the views of Dick Cheney , particularly on matters having to do with the â€œAxis of Evil , â€  then you would have to conclude from the lead editorial in this weekâ€™s edition that the vice president is really , truly angry about the drift of U.S. policy toward the Axisâ€™ two surviving charter members , especially Iran .
â€ œStunningly Shamefulâ€ is the name of the piece written by Hayes on behalf of the editors , which also , of course , includes Bill Kristol .
The title is taken from a quote attributed to â€œformer adviser to Condoleezza Rice , â€ the principal villain of the piece about whom , youâ€™ll remember , Hayes did a real hatchet job in a lengthy feature article in the magazineâ€™s June 2 edition .
One can speculate who that â€œformer adviserâ€ is â€ ” it could be someone from her National Security Council days like Elliott Abrams or J.D. Crouch or from the State Department , such as Robert Joseph or , of course , John Bolton whose complaints about the â€intellectual collapseâ€ of the administration , if not Bush himself , has become a staple of New York Times coverage since Rice sent William Burns to the Geneva talks last weekend .
In any event , I canâ€™t imagine Hayes writing about anything of special interest to the subject of his fawning biography without the latterâ€™s presumed or even actual approval .
( The 2007 book , Cheney : The Untold Story of Americaâ€™s Most Powerful and Controversial Vice President , is available used and new for as little as $ 2.79 on amazon.com . )
â€ œIt has been a dispiriting few weeks , â€ 
Hayes sighs .
â€ œSeveral conservative political appointees have said that they are embarrassed to be working the Bush administration .â€ 
Would that include the vice president ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve on Sunday unveiled sweeping steps to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if needed to bolster confidence in the troubled mortgage financing giants and head off a potential meltdown in global financial markets .
The headquarters of mortgage lender Fannie Mae is shown in Washington in this file photo from October 3 , 2006 .

In moves that could mean a major escalation in U.S. taxpayer exposure , the Fed said the companies could access its discount window for emergency cash .
The Treasury separately said that it would temporarily increase its line of credit to the two , as well as purchase equity in them , if needed .
The move by the Fed echoed its emergency action to help rescue investment bank Bear Stearns in March , when it opened the discount window to investment banks for the first time since the Great Depression .
“ ( Their ) continued strength is important to maintaining confidence and stability in our financial system and our financial markets .
Therefore , we must take steps to address the current situation as we move to a stronger regulatory structure , ” Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in a statement that he read on the steps of the Treasury building .
A senior Treasury official said all the actions it proposed need Congressional approval , but expressed confidence that could be secured within this week .
Charles Schumer , Democratic Senator for New York , praised the plan and said that it should boost investor confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , both shareholder - owned but government - sponsored enterprises whose shares have plummeted .
The dollar edged higher against the euro and the yen on the news , which came before a crucial sale of $ 3 billion in 3 - and 6 - month notes by Freddie Mac on Monday .
Stock futures also gained in relief at this muscular evidence of official U.S. support which follows a battering week on Wall Street .
Shares in the two companies , which own or guarantee just under half of the country ’s $ 12 trillion in mortgage debt , have been hammered by concerns that they might run out of capital amid mounting home - loan losses .
Chief executive Daniel Mudd said in a statement that Fannie Mae holds more than adequate capital reserves and has access to liquidity from capital markets .
He also said that having options to access provisional liquidity if needed would strengthen market confidence .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages from lenders and package them into guaranteed securities sold around the world , providing more funds to keep mortgage markets lubricated .
The two companies play a vital role in U.S. housing markets , which already are experiencing their deepest downturn since the Great Depression , and Treasury and the Fed are on the spot to make sure they do not put a sorely stressed financial system in worse shape than it is already in .
Many fear that were they to fail it would unhinge already suffering world financial markets and inflict a deep recession in the United States that would chill growth everywhere .
First universal theory of humour answers how and why we find things funny .
Published June 12 , The Pattern Recognition Theory of Humour by Alastair Clarke answers the centuries old question of what is humour .
Clarke explains how and why we find things funny and identifies the reason humour is common to all human societies , its fundamental role in the evolution of homo sapiens and its continuing importance in the cognitive development of infants .
Clarke explains : “ For some time now it ’s been assumed that a global theory of humour is impossible .
This theory changes thousands of years of incorrect analyses and mini- theories that have applied to only a small proportion of instances of humour .
It offers a vital answer as to why humour exists in every human society . ”
Previous theories from philosophers , literary critics and psychologists have focused on what we laugh at , on ‘ getting the joke ’ .
“ Humour can not be explained in terms of content or subject matter .
A group of individuals can respond completely differently to the same content , and so to understand humour we have to examine the structures underlying it and analyse the process by which each individual responds to them .
Pattern Recognition
Theory is an evolutionary and cognitive explanation of how and why an individual finds something funny .
Effectively it explains that humour occurs when the brain recognizes a pattern that surprises it , and that this recognition is rewarded with the experience of the humorous response . ” says Clarke .
Humour is not about comedy it is about a fundamental cognitive function .
Clarke explains : “ An ability to recognize patterns instantly and unconsciously has proved a fundamental weapon in the cognitive arsenal of human beings . ”
Recognising patterns enables us to quickly understand our environment and function effectively within it : language , which is unique to humans , is based on patterns .
Clarke ’s theory has wider implications : “ It sheds light on infantile cognitive development , will lead to a revision of tests on ‘ humour ’ to diagnose psychological or neurological conditions and will have implications regarding the development of language .
It will lead to a clarification of whether other animals have a sense of humour , and has an important role to play in the production of artificial intelligence being that will feel a bit less robotic thanks to its sense of humour . ”
Alastair Clarke explains :
“ The development of pattern recognition as displayed in humour could form the basis of humankind ’s instinctive linguistic ability .
Syntax and grammar function in fundamental patterns for which a child has an innate facility .
All that differs from one individual to the next is the content of those patterns in terms of vocabulary . ”
Pattern Recognition
Theory identifies further correlation between the development of humour and the development of cognitive ability in infants .
Previous research has shown that children respond to humour long before they can comprehend language or develop long - term memory .
Humour is present as one of the early fundamental cognitive processes .
Alastair Clarke explains : “ Amusing childish games such as peek - a- boo and clap hands all exhibit the precise mechanism of humour as it appears in any adult form .
Peek - a - boo can elicit a humorous response in infants as young as four months , and is , effectively , a simple process of surprise repetition , forming a clear , basic pattern .
As the infant develops , the patterns in childish humour become more complex and compounded and attain spatial as well as temporal elements until , finally , the child begins to grapple with the patterns involved in linguistic humour . ”
Alastair Clarke explains that the Pattern Recognition Theory “ can not say categorically what is funny .
The individual is of paramount importance in determining what they find amusing , bringing memories , associations , meta- meaning , disposition , their ability to recognize patterns and their comprehension of similarity to the equation .
But the following two examples illustrate its basic structure .
A common form of humour is the juxtaposition of two pictures , normally of people , in whom we recognize a similarity .
What we are witnessing here is spatial repetition , a simple two - term pattern featuring the outline or the features of the first repeated in those of the second .
If the pattern is sufficiently convincing ( as in the degree to which we perceive repetition ) , and we are surprised by recognizing it , we will find the stimulus amusing . ”
“ As a second example , related to the first but in a different medium , stand - up comedy regularly features what we might call the It ’s so true form of humour .
As with the first example , the brain recognizes a two - term pattern of repetition between the comedian ’s depiction and its retained mental image , and if the recognition is surprising , it will be found amusing .
The individual may be surprised to hear such things being talked about in public , perhaps because they are taboo , or because the individual has never heard them being articulated before .
The only difference between the two examples is that in the first the pattern is recognized between one photograph and the next , and in the second it occurs between the comedian ’s words and the mental image retained by the individual of the matter being portrayed . ”
“ Both of these examples use simple patterns of exact repetition , even if the fidelity of that repetition is poor ( for example if the photographs are only vaguely similar ) .
But pattern types can be surprisingly varied , including reflection , reversal , minification and magnification and so on .
Sarcasm , for example , functions around a basic pattern of reversal , otherwise known as repetition in opposites .
Patterns can also contain many stages , whereas the ones depicted here feature only two terms . ”

The network neutrality fight , which has absolutely exploded in Canada in recent months , now has even more ammo after a punk rocker - turned - MP introduced his own network neutrality bill at the House of Commons .
Charlie Angus , who represents Timmins and James Bay , launched his bill one day after 300 people showed up in Ottawa to protest the issue .
" You are citizens of a digital realm and you have rights , " Angus told the crowd , according to the CBC .
The crowd then chanted , " Whose net ?
Our net ! "
As a slogan , this leaves something to be desired , but it does get the point across .
The debate has been sparked in large part by recent revelations about traffic - shaping by Bell Canada , shaping that has allegedly reduced the speed of many P2P sessions by 90 percent .
It applies even to ISPs who resell wholesale access from Bell , and these ISPs have brought Canadian regulators into the battle over the issue .
Angus sings the net neutrality blues
Angus wants Parliament to debate the topic , and his brief bill amends Canada 's Telecommunications
Act to prohibit various forms of discrimination .
P2 Pnet hosts a copy of the text , which outlaws " network management practices that favour , degrade or prioritise any content , application or service is transmitted over a broadband network based on its source , ownership or destination . "
Reasonable network management is still allowed , and ISPs are explicitly allowed to charge different prices for different levels of bandwidth .
Angus used to earn his living from copyrights as a musician in the bands L'Etranger and Grievous Angels , and in an interview this week with the CBC's " Search Engine " radio program ( podcast ) , he spoke with passion about the issue of digital rights and the new common space created by the Internet .
He objects to Canadian ' Net users being referred to incessantly as " consumers " and talks instead of them as " citizens " and the Internet as a hugely empowering medium for democracy .
Angus ' bill was introduced before the long - delayed copyright overhaul bill expected any time now , and Angus seems quite sure that the copyright bill will basically import the DMCA rules wholesale from the US .
His bill is an attempt to strike first with a pro-consumer measure that could also ( if it gains traction ) put pressure on Canadian regulators to act against companies like Bell Canada and Rogers , another notorious Canadian traffic shaper .
Much as the US debate over the net neutrality issue spawned SavetheInteret.com , Canada 's fight this week produced SaveOurNet.ca , a group designed to channel money and manpower where it 's needed most .

Buyer ’s Guide &
Tip how to buy the best Porch Paints :
Welcome to the second section of this article .
At this point in time , we will take you through a few tips you need to grasp prior to making your purchase .
Here we go .
Color Richness
The color richness refers to the depth of the color .
Just how much will it be exposed to elements ?
While some paints are formulated to hold richer and deeper colors , others lack this property .
You should have a clearly defined color richness that you would love to achieve upon your painting .
Coverage
If you choose deep colors then quality is very important to observe .
You must be clear on how many coats you are planning to have .
Some porch paints have the ability to cover over flaws and dark colors thereby getting the job done neatly and faster .
Some can also achieve amazing results just with a single coat .
Washability
For high traffic spots such as porches , hallways , trim , and kitchens , you really have to pay much attention to this factor .
Various porch paints are formulated to stand up to repeat cleanups without the compromise of the color richness .
This factor is equally important when selecting a paint finish .
Shinier finish usually translates to easier cleaning .
Final Thought
Your interior décor truly matters and what will compromise it is not worth laying your hand on .
Our review of top 10 best porch pains sheds more light on valuable paints which could just serve you the best way possible .
Combine the afore - accrued information and the buyer ’s guide and you are sure to paint it nicely .
Large areas of Cuba 's farm land lie fallow and food imports are high Cuba is to put more state - controlled farm land into private hands , in a move to increase the island 's lagging food production .
Private farmers who do well will be able to increase their holdings by up to 99 acres ( 40 hectares ) for a 10 - year period that can be renewed .
Until now , private farmers have only been able to run small areas of land .
The BBC's Michael Voss , in Havana , says this is one of President Raul Castro 's most significant reforms to date .
National security President Castro , who took over from his ailing brother Fidel in February , considers reducing costly food imports as a matter of national security .
For various reasons there is a considerable percentage of state land sitting vacant , so it must be handed over to individuals or groups as owners or users ...
Cuban decree
Since the 1959 revolution , some Cubans have been allowed to run small family farms .
But most agriculture has been placed in the hands of large , state - owned enterprises .
Our correspondent says these have proved highly inefficient - half the land is unused and today Cuba imports more than half its needs .
Rising world food prices will cost the country an extra $ 1bn this year .
The presidential decree was published in the country 's Communist Party newspaper , Granma .
In it , co-operatives are also allowed to add an unspecified amount of additional land for 25 years , with the possibility of renewing the lease .
Grants cannot be transferred or sold to third parties .
" The maximum to be handed over to individuals who do not hold land is 13.42 hectares ( 33 acres ) , and for those who hold lands , as owners or designated workers , the amount can rise as high as 40.26 hectares ( 99 acres ) , " the decree said .
" For various reasons there is a considerable percentage of state land sitting vacant , so it must be handed over to individuals or groups as owners or users , in an effort to increase production of food and reduce imports , " it added .
The decree also said that farmers would have to pay taxes on their production , but it did not say how much .
The reform has been promised for some time by President Castro .
Since taking over the presidency , Raul Castro has signed the UN human rights accords and lifted restrictions on Cubans owning mobile phones and computers .
He has also announced that workers can earn productivity bonuses , doing away with the egalitarian concept that everyone must earn the same , our correspondent says .

The Phoenix Lander lowers itself onto Mars using a set of powerful thrusters .
No airbags for this tricky touch down on the red planet .
Image
DENVER , Colorado — Getting the Phoenix Mars Lander down and dirty on the red planet is anengineering saga stretching out over a decade .
Its mission " raises fromthe ashes " a spacecraft and instruments from two prior tries to reach thered planet : the Mars Polar Lander that failed to phone home in 1999 and a 2001 lander that was mothballed and shelved by NASA .
The builders of those twoearlier spacecraft here at Lockheed Martin Space Systems have taken lessonslearned to send Phoenix on its way .
Fingers are crossed forsure , but confidence is high that , indeed , the flight of the Phoenix will openup a new chapter in Mars exploration .
Shimmy and shake , digdeeper
In putting togetherNASA 's next Mars lander , special attention was placed on the spacecraft 's gangof a dozen pulse - firing descent thrusters that use rapidly opening and closingvalves .
The vibration they create was found to shimmy and shake throughout thespacecraft structure .
A similar system was utilized on the failed Mars Polar Lander .
" That was a hugerisk item to get retired very early , " said Ed Sedivy , the company 's Phoenix program manager .
He led the Lockheed Martin engineering team in designing , constructing , and testing the Phoenix spacecraft .
Other problems that were spotlightedin a failure investigation board looking into the loss of the Mars Polar Lander — as well as those identified by company experts — were tackled by testing , testing and more testing .
" If you look back atthe Mars Polar Lander experience , that mission did not have every opportunityto be successful , " Sedivy told SPACE.com .
Having another chance towork out those problems was key , said Timothy Priser , the Phoenix entry , decentand landing phase lead at Lockheed Martin Space Systems .
" We were given anopportunity to do it again .
And engineers when they are given that opportunityare going to dig deeper and they are going to make it better , " he added .
Not on the radar screen
An early problem Phoenix designers also wrestled with was the prospect that the lander 's radar might lockonto the spacecraft 's own discarded heat shield — and not on the rapidlyapproaching Martian landscape .
That issue was not on theradar screen , quite literally , for the Mars Polar Lander mission nor the MarsSurveyor 2001 program , Priser said .
Radar behavior improvements through the useof an algorithm in the computer brains of the Phoenix lander have solved thisconcern , he added .
Additionally , in thelanding profile for Phoenix , there is a 70 second delay between heat shieldjettison and the time the space probe starts to use its radar to gauge distanceto ground , speed of descent and horizontal velocity .
" It turned out to bea pretty simple fix ... and the delay in the timeline is what will mitigateit , " Priser said .
Big wild card
One of the unknowns thatthe 772 pound ( 350 kilogram )
Phoenix will encounter happens as the craft setsits three legs onto the arctic terrain .
The ground texture shows polygonalcracking — a fractured surface .
" The reconnaissanceof the landing sites has been like nothing we 've ever been the beneficiary ofin the past , " Sedivy said .
He points to the super - powerful camera gearaboard NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) , adding : " It is visualimagery with resolution far better than we 've had in the past . "
Still , what truly awaits Phoenix in terms of arctic surface geology and cold temperatures is a puzzle .
" It 's the thingthat 's the big wild card for us .
We 're going to a place that nobody has everput an asset before , " Sedivy explained .
" It could be thermally morehostile than we were expecting ... or it could be more benign .
We just do n'tknow . "
With descent thrustersfiring , Phoenix will be speeding at about 5.4 miles per hour ( 2.4 meters persecond ) in vertical velocity just before touchdown .
But the horizontal velocitycould be up to 1.4 meters per second , advised Tim Gasparrini , deputy programmanager for the Phoenix entry , descent and landing at Lockheed Martin SpaceSystems .
What will truly greet thelander in terms of slopes , polygons , and rocks is not known .
" It 'ssomewhat of a complicated analysis to do in terms of touchdown , " Gasparrinisaid .
" But we 've got a reasonably high probability of landing success evengiven all factors . "
Phoenix fan dance
Nevertheless ,
Sedivy saidhe 's nervous when trying to second - guess the depth of those polygonal fracturesand what may await Phoenix in terms of any crevasses .
" If they are narrow , the lander wo n't care .
If they are not so narrow , the lander might care , " Sedivy noted .
Phoenix is about exploration , Gasparrini said , " andthis is one of the risks of that exploration . "
All the MRO imagery anddata gathered about the landing site has been phenomenal , he said , " butit 's not the same as being there ... and Phoenix is going to be there . "
Once the Phoenix footpads detect contact with the ground , the lander 's thrusters will shut down .
Theblast effect from those thrusters — from soil liquefaction and gas - soilbursting — is expected to toss light soil and dust up into the air .
Indeed , before thelander 's solar arrays are unfurled , there 's a 20 minute wait , a period of timethought long enough for churned up dust and dirt to settle .
Then the Phoenix fan dance begins : two nearly circular decagons of energy - generating solar cellsextend from opposite sides of the lander , unfolded in Chinese fan - like fashion .
" It 's reallyimportant to get the solar arrays open , to get ourselves power - positive , " Sedivy said .
" You do n't begin to breathe again until you see your solar arraysdeployed . "
Opening day
That crucial opening daydeployment of solar arrays comes down to a wax job .
Electrical power isapplied to a paraffin actuator that , when that wax melts , allows the arrays tospread outward .
That process should take some two to five minutes , with thevariability due to temperature in the landing area and how long it takes forthe wax to melt , Sedivy explained .
In the event that onearray fails to fold out , Gasparrini responded : " We can run a mission .
It 'll be a little different and may not get everything quite done that you wantdone .
But you would be able to run a mission ... one that is tailored to meet yourpower constraints . "
Sedivy added : " Onpaper , we 've got a pretty respectable mission with one solar array . "
But the bad news comes ifboth solar arrays are a no - show .
Phoenix will be alive on batteries for about31 hours .
That trickling down of energy and a ticking countdown clock wouldmean taking risks .
A fast - paced , priority - setting scenario would have to bescripted in order to maximize scientific output from the dying lander .
" It 's not the sortof activity you 'd like to see after spending the last four years designing thevehicle , " Sedivy said .
" So being diligent engineers , there arecontingency procedures in place .
To be ill - prepared for surprises is not inanybody 's best interest , " he pointed out .
First photos
The first photos from Phoenix are meant to provide engineering data .
That is , a footpad picture will conveytechnical information about the surface upon which the lander is resting .
Imagery is also to be taken of pie-shaped sections of the solar arrays .
Thatshould reveal if they are under full - tension and latched in place or a problemhas occurred during deployment .
The cost of the Phoenixmission breaks out into a U.S. investment of $ 420 million , includingdevelopment , science instruments , launch and operations ; plus the CanadianSpace Agency 's investment of $ 37 million for the weather station carriedby the Mars lander .
In coming to full - stop onMars , the spacecraft will have traveled about 422 million miles ( 679 million km ) .
As landing day for Phoenix approaches , the designers , builders and operators of the spacecraft feel thatthey 've treated concerns flagged by the Mars Polar Lander loss and learned fromthe shelved Mars Surveyor 2001 mission .
Confidence - building onthe Phoenix project via extensive testing was done .
A laundry list of issueshas been addressed that might crop up to hinder the lander from safely reaching the red planet and operating successfully at the Martian polar north .
Yet , fingers are stillcrossed .
Getting to Mars is a balance of risk , hard work and a good dose ofluck .
" I think we 've doneeverything that we could have done , " Sedivy concluded .
How representative the descriptions are and what they tell us about the era are still strongly debated .
For example , a question that arises is whether the authors of the scrolls were members of a monastic sect or in fact mainstream .
A conference marking 60 years since the discovery of the scrolls will begin on Sunday at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem , where the stone , and the debate over whether it speaks of a resurrected messiah , as one iconoclastic scholar believes , also will be discussed .
Oddly , the stone is not really a new discovery .
It was found about a decade ago and bought from a Jordanian antiquities dealer by an Israeli - Swiss collector who kept it in his Zurich home .
When an Israeli scholar examined it closely a few years ago and wrote a paper on it last year , interest began to rise .
There is now a spate of scholarly articles on the stone , with several due to be published in the coming months .
“ I could n’t make much out of it when I got it , ” said David Jeselsohn , the owner , who is himself an expert in antiquities .
“ I did n’t realize how significant it was until I showed it to Ada Yardeni , who specializes in Hebrew writing , a few years ago .
She was overwhelmed .
‘ You have got a Dead Sea Scroll on stone , ’ she told me . ”
Much of the text , a vision of the apocalypse transmitted by the angel Gabriel , draws on the Old Testament , especially the prophets Daniel , Zechariah and Haggai .
Ms. Yardeni , who analyzed the stone along with Binyamin Elitzur , is an expert on Hebrew script , especially of the era of King Herod , who died in 4 B.C.
The two of them published a long analysis of the stone more than a year ago in Cathedra , a Hebrew - language quarterly devoted to the history and archaeology of Israel , and said that , based on the shape of the script and the language , the text dated from the late first century B.C .
A chemical examination by Yuval Goren , a professor of archaeology at Tel Aviv University who specializes in the verification of ancient artifacts , has been submitted to a peer - review journal .
He declined to give details of his analysis until publication , but he said that he knew of no reason to doubt the stone ’s authenticity .
Image When David Jeselsohn bought an ancient tablet , above , he was unaware of its significance .

It was in Cathedra that Israel Knohl , an iconoclastic professor of Bible studies at Hebrew University in Jerusalem , first heard of the stone , which Ms. Yardeni and Mr. Elitzur dubbed “ Gabriel ’s Revelation , ” also the title of their article .
Mr. Knohl posited in a book published in 2000 the idea of a suffering messiah before Jesus , using a variety of rabbinic and early apocalyptic literature as well as the Dead Sea Scrolls .
But his theory did not shake the world of Christology as he had hoped , partly because he had no textual evidence from before Jesus .
The annual college textbook rush starts this month , a time of reckoning for many students who will struggle to cover eye - popping costs of $ 128 , $ 156 , even $ 198 a volume .
Caltech economics professor R. Preston McAfee finds it annoying that students and faculty have n’t looked harder for alternatives to the exorbitant prices .
McAfee wrote a well - regarded open - source economics textbook and gave it away -- online .
But although the text , released in 2007 , has been adopted at several prestigious colleges , including Harvard and Claremont - McKenna , it has yet to make a dent in the wider textbook market .
“ I was disappointed in the uptake , ” McAfee said recently at an outdoor campus cafe .
“ But I could n’t continue assigning idiotic books that are starting to break $ 200 . ”
McAfee is one of a band of would - be reformers who are trying to beat the high cost -- and , they say , the dumbing down -- of college textbooks by writing or promoting open - source , no - cost digital texts .

Thus far , their quest has been largely quixotic , but that could be changing .
Public colleges and universities in California this past year backed several initiatives to promote online course materials , and publishers and entrepreneurs are stepping up release of electronic textbooks , which typically sell at reduced prices .
McAfee is a leader in his academic field , a featured speaker at the Yahoo Big Thinkers India conference in March .
Tall and genial , he dresses in khakis , a polo shirt and geeky river sandals .
A coauthor of the best - selling book “ Freakonomics , ” Steven D. Levitt , has described him as brilliant .
What McAfee is not is anti-capitalist .
“ I ’m a right - wing economist , so they ca n’t call me a communist , ” McAfee said .
Yet he turned down $ 100,000 to turn over his open - source textbook “ Introduction to Economic Analysis ” to a commercial publisher .
Advertisement
“ What makes us rich as a society is what we know and what we can do , ” he said .
“ Anything that stands in the way of the dissemination of knowledge is a real problem . ”
McAfee said he wrote his open - source book because the traditional textbook market is broken .
Textbook and college supply prices nearly tripled between 1986 and 2004 , an audit by the federal Government Accountability Office found in 2005 .
With costs continuing to climb , it would be “ reasonable to conclude that [ individual student ] expenditures can easily approach $ 700 to $ 1,000 today even after supplies are subtracted , ” the congressional Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance said in a 2007 report .
“ Publishers have broken an implicit contract with academics , in which we gave our time and they were n’t too greedy , ” McAfee wrote on the web page for his book .
McAfee said many publishers , going for the lowest common denominator , were making some books too simple .
Representatives of the textbook industry say they have invested in new products because instructors have demanded it .

“ Do you think all these PhDs are so lazy , so stupid they buy junk ? ” asked Bruce Hildebrand , the Assn. of American Publishers ’ executive director for higher education .
“ God bless anybody who has got the energy and commitment to put three , four , five years of labor in on a book and then give it away . ”
Just mention textbook prices to university students and the response is outrage and a willingness to switch to online readings .
“ I spent definitely over a grand on textbooks last year , and I did buy [ used ] off Amazon.com , ” said Matt Shiu , 18 , a business economics major at UC Irvine .
“ I ’d rather do my reading on the computer , ” said engineering major Weheb Waheb , 20 .

But sales of all electronic college materials -- CD - ROMs , e-books and online courses -- represented only $ 241 million of $ 3.5 billion in U.S. sales by major publishers in 2007 , despite the fact that they typically sell at a discount , according to the Assn. of American Publishers .
Free and open - source digital texts left too small a footprint to measure , experts said .
“ For all its popularity in the press and on blogs , [ online textbooks are ] all very marginal now , ” said Frank Lyman , executive vice president of CourseSmart , a commercial e-book company .
Open educational resources is an amorphous category for publishers , but basically it includes e-textbooks , courses , videos , taped lectures , tests , software and other materials released online free to the public without restriction on use .
Universities for more than a decade have experimented with open - source educational sites and online libraries as a way to spread knowledge more equitably .
Some seek to change the nature of the textbook by offering “ chunks ” of instruction that professors can mix and match to create their own content “ collections . ”

California State University runs Merlot , a searchable collection of peer - reviewed , online multimedia materials .
Connexions , from Rice University in Houston , stores free , open - licensed educational materials in fields such as music , electrical engineering and psychology .
Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s OpenCourseWare has placed virtually its entire curricula online -- video lectures , problems sets and exams for more than 1,800 courses in 33 disciplines .
Other open - source textbook projects have a subversive edge .
Founders or advocates refer to themselves as “ co-conspirators , ” profess a do - it - yourself ethic and declare an intent to overthrow the textbook industry .
Wikibooks , a collection of textbooks “ anyone can edit , ” is based on the popular Wikipedia model , which invites users to make and correct entries .

In one inmates - take - over - the - asylum scenario , Old Dominion College in Virginia had students compete to write chapters in a wikibook on the “ Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education . ”
Students voted for their favorites , and faculty chose the best versions .
More recently , academics have started embracing open - source resources as a way to reduce students ’ textbook bills .
More than 1,400 faculty last year signed on to a pledge drive supporting open educational resources .
( The drive was organized by Public Interest Research Groups from about 20 states . )
California State University is developing what it calls the Digital Marketplace , a website for selecting , comparing , sharing , approving and distributing both open - source and commercial online educational materials .
One of the biggest pushes for open educational resources has come from California community colleges , where students devoted nearly 60 % of their education spending in 2007 - 08 to textbooks , according to a California State Auditor ’s report released last week .
Advertisement
The Foothill - De Anza Community College District in the Silicon Valley has teamed with the state ’s other two - year colleges to encourage faculty to create , use and select digital textbooks .
The California Community Colleges Board of Governors voted in May to back open educational resources .
“ One of the most heartbreaking things you can see is a student in the bookstore with a course catalog in one hand looking at the book prices to see what courses he can afford to take , ” said Hal Plotkin , a Foothill - De Anza trustee who was instrumental in the drive .
Several experts said a strong shift by California ’s public universities to open - source textbooks could be the jolt that brings them into wider use .
But the open - book movement will face competition from commercial e-book publishers , including CourseSmart , which this fall will begin offering digital versions of 4,300 widely adopted textbooks at half the price of print editions .
Flat World Knowledge , a new company , plans to subsidize free digital titles starting next year , with sales of other materials and printed editions .
Advertisement
Diane Harley , principal researcher at the Center for Studies in Higher Education at UC Berkeley , said professors were n’t going to embrace digital course materials unless they were high quality and tailored to their often unique scholarship .
“ Faculty are independent , they love their fields , and they hand - craft their courses , ” she said .
McAfee has high hopes for an enhanced version of his book that FlatWorld Knowledge plans to release this year .
“ A whole bunch of people do n’t have access to knowledge .
The knowledge in college textbooks , thousands of people hold that knowledge , those skills , ” he said .
“ And there ’s no reason for a small amount of money they could n’t produce books that are pretty good , and provided for free . ”

RUSUTSU , Japan 
It would not be a G - 8 without a microphone mishap .
When leaders of the world ’s richest nations , the so - called Group of 8 , gathered two years ago in St. Petersburg , Russia , President Bush was caught using some blunt , colorful language as he munched a roll during lunch .
For four enlightening minutes , the world was treated to an unvarnished view of George W. Bush as he expounded on everything from his penchant for Diet Coke to his long - winded fellow leaders .
( “ I ’m not going to talk too damn long like the rest of them . ” )
At this week ’s gathering on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido , the lunchtime microphones were on again .
The life - of - the - party president , mingling before the meal , chatted animatedly about his parents ’ health , his birthday and the corruption charges facing one of his best buddies in Europe , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy .
“ Amigo ! Amigo ! ” Mr. Bush called out cheerily in Spanish when he spotted the Italian prime minister .
“ How you doing , Silvio ?
Good to see you ! ”
Later , the president wondered about his former Russian counterpart , Vladimir V. Putin .
“ Did Putin come to see you since I saw you ? ” he asked Mr. Berlusconi .
( He had not . )
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany walked in , clutching a newspaper featuring a photograph of the first President Bush during a recent trip to Berlin .
“ His father , ” she noted to the other leaders , while President Bush looked concerned .
The elder Bush , 84 , has been slowing down since his hip replacement surgery last year .
Blackwater , the US private military contractor widely accused of abuse of power in Iraq , is getting out of the security business .
Company executives said they are moving away from security work in the wake of close media scrutiny of private contractors ' behaviour in Iraq , particularly a Baghdad shooting involving Blackwater employees that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead .
The incident is under investigation by American law enforcement .
" The experience we 've had would certainly be a disincentive to any other companies that want to step in and put their entire business at risk , '' Blackwater founder and chief executive Erik Prince told an Associated Press reporter who was given a daylong tour of the company 's headquarters .
Anne Tyrrell , a Blackwater spokesman , said the company has not planned any " shift , " but rather that the company would grow in other areas besides private security .
" When we are seeking to expand the business we will be doing it in other area , " she said .
" We do n't see that market growing " .
Blackwater has made hundreds of millions of dollars off of contracts to guard US state department officials .
Its seemingly ubiquitous presence , combined with the larger - than - life personality of the conservative Prince , turned Blackwater into an emblem for the privatised military that the Bush administration relied upon to help wage the Iraq war .
The company also operated under broad legal immunity from criminal prosecution in Iraq , attracting criticism from government officials in Washington as well as Baghdad .
The US Congress ultimately passed legislation bringing contracting firms under the American military code of justice .
Blackwater 's now plans to focus attention on its expansive rural training facilities .
Its North Carolina home attracts swarms of US military , law enforcement and local officials each year .
The company also has expanded its aviation division , which provides airplane and helicopter maintenance and also drops supplies into hard - to - reach military bases .
A 6,000 - foot runway is under construction and a large map in the company 's hanger shows units based across the world , from Africa to the Middle East to Australia .
" Our focus is away from security work .
We 're just not bidding on it , " Blackwater president Gary Jackson told the Associated Press .
The debate over how much of military operations should be turned over to for - profit firms has also touched on contractors ' ability to protect its own employees .
Four Blackwater workers were murdered in 2004 in the Iraqi city of Fallujah , then a hotbed of violence , and seven more died in a roadside bomb attack a year later .
Five British private contractors , including IT consultant Peter Moore , were kidnapped from the Baghdad finance ministry by a Shiite militant group 14 months ago .
Anguish over their plight flared this week after reports that one of the hostages succumbed to depression and killed himself while in captivity .
According to the U.S. Census :
Both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007 .
The percentage without health insurance was 15.3 percent in 2007 , down from 15.8 percent in 2006 , and the number of uninsured was 45.7 million , down from 47.0 million .

The Cases
The New York Times found 121 cases in which veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan committed a killing in this country , or were charged with one , after their return from war .
Solar energy produced from one acre of land , compared to the ethanol energy produced from one acre of corn .
One acre of good corn growing land in America will produce about 140 bushels of corn during a one year growing season .
As a matter of interest the all time record harvest is over 260 bushels per acre but we also have to remember that more often the all time low has been zero bushels per acre .
A bushel is considered to be about 56 lbs .
The current corn harvest is only possible due to the artificial fertilizers , herbicides and pesticides that are routinely applied to America ’s corn crop .
A little over 2 lbs of fertilizer and chemicals are used for each bushel of corn grown .
This averages about 1 lb of nitrogen , 0.4 lbs of phosphate and 0.5 lbs of potassium .
The herbicides and pesticides amount to about 0.22 lbs of active ingredients per bushel .
This might not sound like much but on Kentucky corn alone , pesticides and herbicides equal about 3 million lbs per year .
Corn is responsible for a hell of a lot of toxic chemicals that have created untold difficulties .
The USDA estimates that it takes 53,000 BTU ’s of energy to convert 1 bushel of corn to 2.8 gallons of ethanol and most of the new ethanol plants are using coal for this energy .
The USDA vigorously supports corn based ethanol production ; unfortunately they are using accounting methods that completely ignore any environmental impacts from the entire process .
These are the same accounting methods that are currently wrecking the planet .
Then there are the energy costs associated with building the equipment the farmer uses to grow the corn , the energy costs that the farmer used himself , the associated production and transportation energy incurred to get seed , fuel , fertilizer and chemicals to the farmer , the energy to get the corn to the ethanol plants , the energy needed to turn the corn into ethanol and then the energy to get the ethanol into your car .
There are many other energy costs that are directly attributable to the production of ethanol but we do n’t count them for gasoline so why should we count them for ethanol ?
The answer is , because they exist .
Ignoring all the little details to make gasoline or ethanol look better than they actually are is called fooling yourself .
Many Americans complain about $ 3+/ gallon gasoline but fail to realize that the true cost of a gallon of gasoline is currently about $ 20 / gallon .
So the argument continues but it seems reasonable to conclude that gasoline , diesel and ethanol are much more expensive than the pump price .
Smart guys have spent a lot of time looking at this and have come to the same conclusion .
So to keep this simple , 140 bushels of corn grown on one acre in one year can be converted to 392 gallons of ethanol .
At 76,000 BTU ’s per gallon this equals 30 million BTU ’s per acre , per year , from corn , when it is converted to the liquid fuel ethanol .
Some folks say that it takes more than 30 million BTU ’s to produce this much ethanol , in which case this huge effort is a waste of time but the USDA ethanol guys say it takes just over 20 million .
Nobody says you end up with a net 30 million BTU ’s from an acre of corn , less than 10 million BTU ’s actually produced is tops .
All this means that the energy equivalent to at least 3 gallons of ethanol is burned to produce 4 gallons of ethanol .
Therefore , we ultimately end up burning 7 gallons of fossil fuels to produce the equivalent of 3 gallons of gasoline ( 3 instead of 4 due to the greater BTU ’s in gas and diesel than ethanol ) .
Due to the similar amount of pollution created burning ethanol compared to gasoline , the production and use of ethanol represents a massive increase in global warming gases , pollution and expense .
Aside from the relative efficiency of the process , which will be argued over until the cows come home , this increased pollution has been ignored and the increased costs are being picked up by the good old taxpayer .
Tragically many vested interests have supported this process for the same reason that vested interests have denied global warming .
Of course , there is a more important issue here that the West has been happy to ignore while it spends billions to create fuel from food .
It must be considered reprehensible to convert huge quantities of food to fuel on a planet where 26,500 children die each and every day due to not having enough , while the West wastes so much .
Fortunately , there is an eminently reasonable solution , which the fossil fuel gangs have rejected , simply because they have put their greed ahead of everything else .
Governments have also rejected this solution because they seldom lead the way and they are also obsessed with short term gain and votes .
Let ’s have a look at what 1 acre of land can produce using photovoltaic ( PV ) panels that are now up to 20 % efficient .
That means that 20 % of the solar energy that reaches the panels is converted into electricity .
Twenty percent is a reasonable number these days .
The best conversion is 50 % using prohibitively expensive equipment but 30 % is also reasonable using solar energy to produce steam that can drive generators .
The sun conveniently delivers about 1000 watts of energy per square meter to the earth ’s surface ( at an angel of 90 degrees ) .
At 20 % efficiency each square meter of photovoltaic panel will therefore produce about 200 watts of electricity .
We need 5 square meters of PV panels to produce 1000 watts .
In 1 acre there are 4047 square meters .
Divide that by 5 , the area to produce 1000 watts and you get 809 , x 1000 watts = 809,000 watts per hour of sunshine , or 809 kilowatts per acre .
One kilowatt equals 3,400 BTU ’s so in one hour , one acre of solar panels could produce 809 x 3,400 = 2.75 million BTU’s .
Naturally it makes sense to locate solar facilities where you get the most sunshine although corn growing areas are quite good .
The Americans deserts receive over 7 hours of productive sunshine per day so 7 hours times 2.75 million BTU ’s equals 19.25 million BTU ’s per day per acre .
Let ’s reduce that to 15 million BTU ’s to account for installation inefficiencies but you can see that after ONE DAY of solar electrical production we have at least 50 % more energy than one year of corn energy from ethanol production .
In the desert parts of America getting this kind of sunshine is possible for well over 300 days per year .
This means that solar energy plants , that are commercially available today , can produce about 500 times more energy from the same area as ethanol from corn .
To be fair we also have to look at the input costs associated with producing this solar energy .
In optimal solar locations , like the American deserts , it will take less than 2 years to produce the energy that was required to make the solar installation in the first place .
The solar system will then go on to produce clean energy for decades .
Like the ethanol gangs the solar gangs tell us that significant new efficiencies will emerge in the near future .
We should also mention that electrical energy is as useful as liquid energy .
It is clean energy we need ; the form of that energy is secondary .
It is also worth mentioning that solar energy is not difficult to store so that solar energy can be available 24/7 however most energy is used during the day .
Of course all this begs the question .
Why would anyone destroy a vast amount of food to produce a relatively insignificant amount of global warming energy when a clean , inexhaustible source of energy is going to waste ?
Currently humans produce energy equal to about 10,000 million tons of oil per year .
That is equal to about 250 billion , million BTU ’s per year .
The good old sun produces vast amounts of clean fusion energy than we can access without wrecking the planet .
On the land surface of this earth , solar energy equals about 100 trillion BTU ’s per hour , 24 hours a day , 365 days of the year , 6000 times what people produce from all sources .
Could it be that because solar energy is “ free ” we humans have rejected it because less profit can be made ?
Could it be that we are that greedy and that foolish ?
Could it be ?

It ’s been a long time coming , but buying a new car with a diesel engine is now an option in all 50 states , including California .
Thanks to CARB ( the California Air Resources Board ) and the lack of pollution advancements in diesel engine technology for the past little while , car shoppers in The Golden State could n’t get a new car with a diesel engine .
Not only did this prevent people from obtaining cars that were more fuel efficient , it also meant that if Californians wanted to run an alternative fuel like biodiesel , buying used was their only option .
The first of the new breed available will be VW ’s Jetta TDi , although this will most certainly be followed by Mercedes ’ own line - up of diesels .
The Jetta in diesel guise provides a combined 33 MPG for the sedan , and a slightly higher 34 MPG for the SportWagen .
That ’s pretty impressive for a car the size and weight of a new Jetta ( VWs have been on the porky side for a while ) , so for certain kind of buyers , say new families , a clean diesel Jetta SportWagen could be a very good answer to their transportation questions .
A large part of cleaner - running diesels in 2008 is the fact that the government reformulated what goes into diesel fuel ; in this case , they lowered the amount of sulfur allowed , so that gave automakers a leg up .
In the case of the cleaner - burning diesel engines , both VW and Mercedes are using a catalytic converter that stores a diesel engine ’s high NOx emissions .
This , although prosaic and mundane , is more than a bit of a breakthrough , given that the first answer from Merc was to inject urea into the exhaust header .
( The way we understand it NOx , or nitrogen oxide , can be chemically bound to urea , rendered inert , and then flushed out the tail pipe of the car .
The new catalytic converter is far more elegant . )
If you want to go beyond low - sulfur diesel , consider putting some biodiesel in your tank .
But note that your vehicle warranty may be effected affected for fuels that are blended with more than 20 percent biodiesel — check here for details .
So , the new clean diesel Jettas are here — prices start at $ 21,990 .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) -
The surge in popularity for small cars and fuel - efficient hybrids has left Toyota Motor Corp facing an unusual problem : deepening shortages of popular models such as the Prius hybrid .
A Prius with the new Hybrid engine is seen at the fair stand of Japanese car manufacturer Toyota at the international car show IAA in Frankfurt , September 11 , 2007 .

A limited inventory of small cars hurt Toyota , which reported a 11.5 percent drop in U.S. sales in June .
In stark contrast , Japanese rival Honda Motor Co reported a 13.8 percent sales rise on record demand for its
Fit subcompact car and Civic sedan .
Toyota executives said a dwindling inventory of vehicles , such as the Prius , Yaris and Corolla , had forced the automaker to scramble to try to keep up with demand in June , a month when industry - wide U.S. auto sales dropped almost 9 percent .
Sales of Toyota ’s Prius , the top- selling hybrid in the U.S. market , fell 26 percent as dealers ran short of inventory and customers faced a six - month waiting list .
Toyota said it would only partly be able to satisfy the backlog of demand from its dedicated Prius factory in Japan this year .
Hybrids command about a $ 5,000 price premium compared with equivalent vehicles without the expensive battery .
“ It is very doubtful that there is going to be a lot of recovery this year to be able to satisfy consumer demand and that is very unfortunate , ” said Jim Lentz , Toyota ’s head of North American sales , referring to the Prius .
Toyota had a one - day supply of the Prius hybrid and a 2 - 1 / 2 day supply of its hybrid Camry sedan at the end of June .
Inventory of other popular Toyota cars also ran low in June .
Dealer supply of Corolla sedans was down to a 15 - day supply , while Yaris had a 7 - day supply at the end of June , the automaker said .
Toyota said it expected inventories of Yaris and Corolla to increase in August and was working to add capacity at its hybrid battery manufacturing plant in Japan .
The current generation Prius uses nickel - metal hydride batteries made by Panasonic EV , a joint venture between the automaker and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd .
Toyota , which put the world ’s first hybrid car on the road in 1997 , has a goal of reaching global annual sales of 1 million hybrid vehicles soon after 2010 -- more than double last year ’s sales tally .
Toyota ’s Lentz said the production constraint made it hard to forecast how large the market for the hybrid model could be in the United States , the Japanese automaker ’s largest market .
“ We do n’t know what the top end on Prius is , ” Lentz said .
In a J.D. Power survey , 72 percent of U.S. consumers said they were interested in buying a hybrid .
Overall , the U.S. sales performance of the three major Japanese automakers were mixed in June with Nissan Motor Co posting a 7.5 percent decline .
Honda bucked the downtrend in overall U.S. light car sales , outselling Chrysler LLC for the second consecutive month in June to grab the No. 3 spot in the U.S. market .
On a combined basis , the three major Japanese automakers increased their share of the U.S. market to 34.7 percent , up from 32.9 percent from a year ago .
The market share of the three Detroit automakers -- General Motors Corp , Ford Motor Co and Chrysler -- fell to 45.8 percent in June from 50.2 percent a year earlier .
CLINTON STEALS THE SHOW ….
“ You have n’t worked so hard over the last 18 months , or endured the last eight years , to suffer through more failed leadership , ” she said .
“ No way .
No how .
No McCain . ”
Hillary Clinton had a variety of competing goals to achieve in her convention speech last night , none of them easy .
She had to offer her forceful , unequivocal support for her former rival , Barack Obama .
She had to make the case that John McCain would be a disaster .
She to convince some of her reluctant supporters to come together as Democrats for the good of the nation .
And she had to do it all with grace , humor , and memorable soundbites that could be replayed over and over again .
To borrow the grand - slam metaphor I ’ve heard quite a bit , Clinton touched all the bases .
To those supporters who may be tempted to help McCain win , Clinton ’s message was unambiguous : “ I want you to ask yourselves :
Were you in this campaign just for me ?
Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him ?
Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids ?
Were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage ?
Were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible ? ”
It was a powerful reminder that Clinton ’s values and priorities are more important than one candidate or one campaign .
It was an obvious argument that Clinton made eloquently — it wo n’t honor Clinton to betray her vision for a stronger nation .
To support her is to support her agenda , and Obama shares her agenda .
Her indictment against McCain was just as powerful : “ [ W ]e do n’t need four more years , of the last eight years .
More economic stagnation , and less affordable health care .
More high gas prices , and less alternative energy … .
John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound .
John McCain does n’t think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis .
John McCain wants to privatize Social Security .
And in 2008 , he still thinks it ’s okay when women do n’t earn equal pay for equal work .
With an agenda like that , it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities .
Because these days they ’re awfully hard to tell apart . ”
I ’ve seen some argue that Clinton ’s endorsement of Obama was n’t personal enough .
Perhaps .
But at the same time , she effectively explained that an Obama victory is an absolute necessity : “ We are Americans .
We ’re not big on quitting .
But remember , before we can keep going , we have to get going by electing Barack Obama president .
We do n’t have a moment to lose or a vote to spare .
Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance . ”
There was n’t a hint of disappointment or regret .
I do n’t know if this will silence the incessant media obsession with an intra-party “ rift ” — it probably wo n’t — but most reasonable people who gave Clinton a fair hearing came away feeling more confident in the strength of the party , and Obama ’s chances in November .
Some of McCain ’s advertising this week has emphasized the line , “ Hillary ’s right . ”
After watching her address last night , I kept thinking , “ She sure is . ”
Fed up with patent holding companies suing them , a consortium of high - tech companies is taking a different approach : beat them to the punch .
According to The Wall Street Journal ( subscription ) , the business heavyweights behind the move include Google , Verizon , Cisco , and Hewlett - Packard .
The premise is that the companies will put money into a holding company , to be called Allied Security Trust , that will buy up patents and then license them to consortium members for free .
The need for these measures should be apparent to anyone who has followed the intellectual property scene in recent years .
No company seems safe from having an essential part of their services covered by someone else 's patents , many of which seem to have never been put into use by their holders .
One of the more egregious examples include a suit charging every cell phone provider under the sun with infringement for sending international text messages .
Another fine example was provided by a company that sued for infringement , pocketed a settlement , and then sold the patent to a subsidiary in order to sue again .
These are all serious annoyances , but The Journal 's report mentions a more dangerous example : the patent suit that almost brought down BlackBerry maker Research In Motion .
At one point during the proceedings , the company was in danger of having to shut down , with potentially disastrous repercussions for it and its hordes of perpetually connected users .
The effort would mark a second front in the effort to cope with the hazards of intellectual property litigation , as most of the companies are members of the Coalition for Patent Fairness , which is pushing for enactment of the Patent Reform Act .
They also show up on the rolls of the Intellectual Property Owners Association .
This is n't the first venture of this sort , as some ex-Microsoft employees have founded a private patent licensing company for the same reasons .
Still , the company 's website notes , " Our focus is on inventing and investing in invention .
While litigation is possible in any business , it is not a goal of IV [ our company ] . "
Their inability to rule litigation out clearly left these companies nervous .
The companies will undoubtedly have to keep pumping money into the holding trust in order for it to continue to purchase patents , but the fees for buying them from small inventors are unlikely to exceed those exchanged in a typical settlement ; they 're certainly less drastic than a threat to shut a company down .
The key issue will be whether Allied Security Trust can identify key patents and purchase them ahead of the trolls .
Some of you might remember when we reported on the real - life XOS 2 Iron - Man suit a few days ago .
I suppose this would be the kids - size version .
This is the Kid ’s Walker , which has a height of 5 1/4 feet .
I suppose that is pretty tall if you are a kid .
I ’m not certain if you really want to put your kid in this suit .
Seriously , if you think the kid has a tantrum now , wait until he or she puts on this iron suit .
The end result would be like the climax of a monster movie .
By the way , the Kid ’s Walker does n’t really walk , it more shuffles along on a pair of wheeled feet .
I believe it is controlled by two joysticks , and some of those pedals probably do that as well .
The XOS 2 can lift about 170 pounds , but I have no idea how much this one can lift .
Okay , I would love to see footage of a kid in this suit , tearing apart cars or something .
Man , would I love to have some video of that .
Seriously , I would pay to have video of that bad - boy footage .
This Kids Walker is designed by Sakakibara Kikai , and it costs about $ 21,000 .

“ My reputation as a ladies ’ man was a joke .
It caused me to laugh bitterly the 10,000 nights I spent alone . ” — Leonard Cohen
It is almost universally assumed that rock musicians avail themselves of copious , practically on - demand casual sex with their fans .
The images of rock stars lounging backstage after a show literally covered in a blanket of squirming young girls , or running for their lives from hungry teens willing to perform any deed no matter how depraved , are so pervasive they practically define the job .
It ’s a case of collective wishful thinking , shared by the fans , their detractors , and the musicians themselves , that casual sex is a crucial and inextricable fringe benefit of being a musician .
My married friends accost me with salacious and knowing winks , our female fans eye each other at the merch table like hungry cats around a wounded bird , girlfriends past and present peremptorily accuse me of everything short of sex slavery and will not be assuaged , and interviewers leer and blatantly solicit for details — all while the unglamorous truth flops around like a beached carp .
Whenever I ’ve attempted to disavow this myth of constant sex - having , which I ’m forced to do whenever I ’m introduced as a “ rock star ” or whenever I so much as shake hands with a girl , I ’m roundly ignored and even scorned .
I ca n’t count the times I ’ve stood in a group of guys and patiently denied ever deflowering a single teenaged groupie or making it with a Satan - worshipping sex cult , only to be dismissed as either blatantly lying or shouted down by rousing disbelief and horror .
The legend of rock debauchery is too powerful , too precious , for even my closest friends not to suspect that somewhere , after the show and behind some velvet curtain , I must be shagging teeny - boppers three at a time .
Like all fantasies and myths , this one is so powerful because it ’s based in fact .
People do go crazy for their favorite bands , and that craziness often gets expressed in sexual form .
Teenage fans in particular often do n’t have the maturity to separate lust from their other feelings ( I know I did n’t ; hello , Jane Wiedlin ) , but even well into adulthood people will go slightly bananas when confronted with the physical presence of the person who sings their favorite tunes .
Likewise , musicians are often quite receptive to the idea of receiving adoration in sexual form .
It ’s very confusing to be treated like such a special person for an hour a night , and doubly so to be stared at unblinkingly by excited fans after the show .
An attractive person willing to steal you away and lavish you with kisses is a welcome respite from routine , especially since your bandmates have long ago stopped treating you like a special person .
Still , even with both parties striving to make it happen , it ’s fairly difficult for touring rock musicians to hook up with their fans , and the vast majority of interactions never get anywhere close to sex .
In the first place , fans are often terribly confused about how to express their desire .
They want to give something nice to the band , and they want to take something unique and personal from the band , and sex is the medium of expression they envision first .
It ’s a good start .
They ’ve dressed seductively , they ’ve been practically molested by the bass frequencies , and they ’re a little drunk ; it ’s a perfect storm !
Approaching the band after the show , they ’re clearly worked up to an excited state , but in the moment of contact they lose their nerve or are n’t quite sure how to make the transaction .
I see it all the time : the searching eyes , the lingering handshakes , the timidly suggestive comments — but with no plan or vision of follow - through beyond simply presenting themselves as available and waiting for the musician to do the rest .
They seem to expect that if they make enough lascivious comments , they ’ll suddenly be swept away by a phalanx of Hell ’s Angels bodyguards to the palatial backstage , where the rock star will materialize freshly showered in a terry - cloth robe and cover them with strawberries on a bearskin rug .
Unfortunately , most touring bands have a lot of really unglamorous work to do after a show , and after a few tours it is n’t easy to get a pass from the other guys to ditch the heavy lifting every time some drunk girl asks you to sign her boob .
The image of the bearskin rug and the strawberries slowly fades after the girl sits on the curb for half an hour watching her love interest and his bandmates , drenched in sweat , heaving their ripped - up amps into the back of their dented 10 - year old van before heading to the Super 8 out on the interstate .
For a romantic getaway to happen requires more intestinal fortitude than a couple of mojitos usually provides , and before long the smitten fan is led away by her more sensible , and sober , girlfriend .
Alas .
In the early years , when you and your band have a little less class , maybe you ’ll do some hooking up with fans in bathroom stalls , or locked dressing rooms , or on fire escapes , and inevitably there will be plenty of lame goose - chases where four guys end up sleeping on the floor of a one - bedroom apartment while the fifth guy is four feet away behind a tapestry trying in whispers to convince a drunk groupie that they ’ve come too far for her to pass out now .
The first couple of tours , where everyone is on the make , feel like fun — like rock and roll — because no one has the expectation that rock stars should get laid more strongly than newly minted rock stars do .
But after a few tours , when the ratio of good experiences to bad ones has started to sink in , the minimum criteria of enticement start to rise .
Sneaking away with a girl sets in motion a whole chain of circumstances , and each one has to go exactly right for the experience to be worthwhile .
A bad night with a deranged and drunk fan can ruin a whole week of subsequent shows .
You can get sick , or lose a night of sleep that ’ll take five days to make up , and the blow to your self - confidence can darken an entire tour .
I once had a more seasoned rock star laugh ruefully at me when I returned from an ill - fated encounter .
He took one look at my dejected and disheveled slouch and said , “ I knew she was bad news , she had high - maintenance hair . ”
After awhile , almost no circumstances will lure you away from the comfort of your bandmates and your routine .
You become superstitious , even paranoid , waiting for the beautiful and fascinating fan who singled you out at the bar to suddenly reveal that she “ knew you were a Virgo by your antennae ” or that you “ remind her of all of her dead boyfriends . ”
Once your band starts doing well , you might go through a second phase in which you start playing like a high roller .
It ’s part of everyone ’s rock - star fantasy to stroll into a nice hotel at two in the morning with a foxy girl giggling on your arm and say to the desk clerk , “ I ’ll take a room , my good man , with a king - sized bed . ”
You feel like a real killer .
But do it a couple of times in London or Berlin or New York City , and you ’ll start to feel like a chump who paid $ 350 for a plain hotel room to have some awkward sex and then get four hours of fitful sleep .
It does n’t pencil out .
The “ real ” high rollers are the musicians who can afford to have people carry their bags , set up their gear , and handle all the business while they traipse around teasing their hair and complaining about the deli tray .
When you first make the transition from sleeping on people ’s floors to staying in hotels , it ’s seductive to think that the days of wine and roses are upon you , but as long as your band is still lifting its own amps , you ’ve got no business spending $ 350 to have sex with a fan .
The fact is that most musicians are sensitive people almost by definition — certainly most singers are , otherwise what the hell are they whining about ?
And sensitive whiners are perhaps the least - suited people in the world to be having casual sex with worshipful strangers .
Horny girls at shows do n’t take into consideration all the unique circumstances of musicians on tour , and they behave like horny drunk girls everywhere .
They decide at the last minute that they ’re not over their ex-boyfriend , or they sober up enough on the long ride to their house to suddenly realize their roommate is home , or they just get a charge out of teasing , or whatever 10,000 other games get played in bars across the land , without considering that the musician they snared in their web has got to drive 600 miles tomorrow to play another show .
If that musician was hoping to have a little casual sex to break the monotony of touring and give themselves a boost of self - esteem to make it through 2,000 more miles , they are in for some unhappy time on the cat - hair - covered papa -san .
The honest truth is that most touring musicians — unless they are complete sociopaths — learn to take it easy with the sex .
There are rare occasions when someone extraordinary appears like a bolt of lightning after a show , and for those special people we musicians are eternally grateful .
But the person with the unfocused eyes and “ high - maintenance hair ” is probably not going to shelter you from the storm so much as she ’s going to serve you undercooked Top Ramen and vomit on your shoes .
Will you want to wake up next to her , especially if she has posters of your band on her bedroom wall ?
Yikes !
That said , see that drunk girl in the polka - dot dress and the bright red Mary Janes leaning against the bar and talking too loud to her slightly gothy friends ?
I know we have to be in Chapel Hill tomorrow , but she says she only lives 25 miles away , and if I put a couple of gallons of gas in her Honda Civic , she ’ll make me a late dinner at her place .
I ’ll see you guys in the morning .

There are probably three things necessary if the United States government is to better provide for the American people :
First , expose as baseless and harmful the pseudoscientific theories that claim to show that helping people actually hurts them , that charity is cruelty , that a higher minimum wage hurts workers , that health coverage leads to poor habits and health , that altruism does n't " really " exist and therefore should not be engaged in , etc .
Second , recount for people enough stories of actual altruism , both individual and collective , that they understand its power and are inspired to engage in it and promote it .
Third , make some systemic changes in our government so that the will of the people , thus developed , can have some impact on it .
The first two requirements are accomplished in a wonderful new book called " The Samaritan 's Dilemma : Should Government Help Your Neighbor ? " by Deborah Stone .
She sets out to address the problem that many Americans do not think of government as a way to help anyone or do good in the world .
Those who want to do good often choose to do so privately , and are often then frustrated by the much greater harm done by the government they 've ignored .
She traces dismissal of government as a way to help to claims of the past few decades that government aid goes to parasites who would actually be better off if forced to shape up and take care of themselves .
Stone agrees that there are many cases in which people are best served by showing them how to help themselves .
But , she points out , " The problems that get people pumped up about politics are ones that are beyond the capacity of individuals to solve themselves , no matter how smart or skilled they are or could become and no matter how hard they try .
Among these problems : health insurance ; much if not most illness and injury ; safe and affordable housing ; steady work with sufficient pay and benefits to take care of a family ; adequate retirement income ; affordable higher education and effective primary education ; broken , violent neighborhoods ; transportation between where people live and where they work ; and all the various forms of discrimination , in which people are treated on the basis of stereotypes , no matter what their merits . "
Stone even blames the Help - Is - Harmful ethos for the diminishment of community in the United States and the rise of bowling alone .
Disagreeing with Robert Putnam , she writes : " I trace this withdrawal to a deeper moral source : People who think of themselves as kind and compassionate hesitate to belong to a club of meanies .
When people are told not to reach out to other people because help is harmful , they have to harden themselves and act mean when they would rather be kind .
If citizens do n't join groups , cooperate with each other , or participate in politics as much as we used to , it 's likely because we can't get along with OURSELVES .
The contradiction between our private and public moralities is too hard to bear . "
Chapter 2 is the key to Stone 's eight - chapter book .
In it she lays out seven arguments against helping people and convincingly reduces them to laughable fairy - tales .
These arguments tend , Stone shows , to be based on sleights of hand that occur prior to the arguments .
Those in need of help are depicted from the start as not needy , not hungry , not suffering in any way .
And help is defined from the start as a reward , not as alleviation of any sort of suffering .
" To believe help is harmful , " she writes , " you have to think of it as something people can do without .
You have to have already decided that they do n't really need it .
And that is the big deception , the invidious moral claim at the heart of conservative logic . "
At the heart of libertarian logic , Stone suggests , is the notion that a government can only provide for anyone by ENSLAVING others .
But , as Stone points out , we tend not to agree with this belief that we have been enslaved .
In fact , despite the success of the help - is - harmful crusade in demonizing welfare , polls show that most Americans want their government to take some of their money and give it to those in need .
When you 've reached the point of alleging voluntary slavery , it 's time to check the battery in your BS detector !
Chapters 3 through 7 consist largely of accounts of altruism , most of them very small scale and personal .
If you 're in search of debate talking points and syllogistic proofs you might be tempted to skip all of this and jump to chapter 8 to find out what any of it has to do with government .
I would advise against doing so .
We do not learn good behavior by syllogism , but by example .
And these examples are not without several key lessons along the way .
Through Stone 's accounts of altruism , we discover not only that many Americans are very altruistic , not only that we are ourselves altruistic in various ways , but also that we want to be more so , and that much altruism is discouraged by government policies that should promote it and shamed by public perceptions that ought to praise and honor it .
Prominent are stories of home healthcare workers who are forbidden to have contact with their clients outside of official visits and forbidden to assist them in various ways , but who go out of their way to help anyway .
Far from doing so to win praise , these workers take these steps with a sense of shame that they are weak and doing wrong , violating public morality .
That 's a public morality I want no part in .
Stone does an outstanding job of debunking the rightwing application of theories from the physical sciences to moral prescription .
Sadly , she then engages in a bit of it herself , arguing that neuroscience has shown that humans and other animals engage in altruism .
Stone had already shown that sufficiently by her extensive account of the presence of altruism in our behavior .
Playing along with the pretense that somebody with a microscope and a lab coat has to sanction our behavior by agreeing that it exists serves no useful purpose and only sets people up for a fall the next time some new scientific finding is alleged to discover the dominant presence of sadism .
But this is a minor note in a valuable book that goes on to show that people are most likely to be more altruistic if you tell them that they already are , give them credit for it , and give them responsibility for it .
And the best way to give people responsibility is often to ask them to help someone else .
The best programs and organizations for developing active citizens are not those that refrain from helping , but those that show people how they can help others .
It 's not " Teach a man to fish " so much as " Teach a man to teach others to fish . "
Now , imagine that we work privately and through local and state governments to put our energy into helping people through programs that give them responsibility , show them how to help others , and develop in them the idea that they have an interest and a responsibility in government .
We would be moving in the direction of influencing Washington .
But we would still be miles away .
It is very rare for majority opinion to carry the day in our capital .
We would still be shut out of the corporate media , not because our ideas are less attractive than those of people who claim to oppose charity for the good of the poor , but because the corporate media is corporate .
We would still have very little influence with elected officials , because a legalized system of bribery puts them in the pockets of wealthy interests .
Winning over individual elected officials would still be of little value , since the two voices of two overgrown factions known as " parties " command the obedience of most so - called public servants at the national level .
We would still be hard - pressed to elect real representatives without verifiable vote counting , elections on weekends , instant runoff voting , election day registration , and so many other reforms needed to make voting easier and more credible .
And we will never have money to spend on doing good as long as we are borrowing trillions of dollars to spend on killing people around the world .
Sadly , Stone 's few references to war in her book are not helpful .
She claims that what the United States is doing in Iraq is " trying to seed " democracy and attempting the almost impossible task of " protecting Iraqis from insurgent violence without killing innocent civilians . "
Apparently oblivious to eternally stop - lossed contracts , she even proposes as admirable altruists the " experienced soldiers who stay with the armed services [ " services " - a phrase she does not question ] instead of switching to a private security firm to do the same dangerous job for ten times the military pay . "
I 'm sure Stone imagines it insignificant in a book on domestic ethics to swallow whole the Pentagon 's laughable propaganda , a pile of lies and nonsense that Stone would be more than capable of debunking were she so inclined .
But she should consider the harm done when books on foreign policy or other topics mention in passing their complete acceptance of the hooey and bunkum that Stone has devoted her book to denouncing .
We will have to tackle all of these problems if we are to build a better world .
Stone has given us several strong bricks to work with .

Here ’s the problem , Jerry .
It ’s not your baby .
It has n’t been since 1996 , when Yahoo went public .
At that moment , you suddenly had to answer to your new owners : your shareholders .
In fact , Jerry , as a board member since Yahoo went public , it has always been your job to look out for Yahoo ’s shareholders .
But we sure would n’t know that from the way you ’ve acted these past months .
I have n’t seen this much contempt for shareholders since Robert Nardelli ran Home Depot .
I can hear you now , protesting that it was Microsoft that walked away , not you , that you were always open to a deal , and that you were just trying to negotiate a better price than the $ 33 a share Microsoft ultimately offered .
That ’s been your spin all along .
But how many times did Microsoft ’s chief executive , Steve Ballmer , come knocking on your door the last few years , seeking a merger .
Three ?
Four ?
I hear that about a year and a half ago , he offered $ 41.50 a share to your then chief executive Terry Semel  and no less an authority than Michael Milken told Mr. Semel that Yahoo ’s shareholders were never likely to see that price again .
( Your P.R. guy denies this offer was ever made . )
Since then , your stock has been sinking .
By the time Mr. Ballmer made his $ 31 - a- share proposal in late January  and announced it publicly to force you to take it seriously  your stock was so low that his offer still represented a 62 percent premium .
Yet you and your board rejected it almost out of hand  while you went scrambling to find a white knight , as they used to call it back in the 1980s .
When it turned out that nobody in techland was much interested in playing that role  and your big shareholders were furious  you were forced to negotiate with Mr. Ballmer .
It sure did n’t look as though you ever took those negotiations seriously .
You rarely brought any of your investment bankers  thus casting aside the very people who know how to make mergers happen  and sometimes the only person you brought along was Mr. Filo  who is n’t even on Yahoo ’s board !
4 Simple Steps to Detect & Fix Slow Rails Requests
UPDATE : We ’ve released 2016 : We ’ve released Scout App Monitoring , which automates these steps for you .
In Blink , Malcom Gladwell ’s book on split - second decisions , Gladwell tells the story of how the Emergency Department at Chicago ’s Cook County Hospital changed their process for diagnosing chest pain .
Dr. Brendan Reilly instituted a simple test to determine whether a patient was suffering from a heart attack .
It combined just 4 questions with the results of an ECG .
This simple test was 70 % better than the barrage of questions previously asked by hospital staff to identify patients that were n’t having a heart attack and was nearly 20 % better at identifying patients that were having heart attacks .
More information on the patient ’s symptoms often led to an incorrect diagnosis .
It distracted doctors from the real issues .
I ’ve seen this many times with developers trying to debug performance issues in Rails applications .
They look at outliers instead of the obvious culprits .
It ’s part of the reason I ’ve never felt a need for a deep , detailed Rails monitoring application ( i.e. – benchmarks from the controller to the database level on every request ) .
The majority of the time , our performance problems have nothing to do with the Rails framework ( and we ’ve worked through a lot of issues since we started building Rails apps in 2005 ) .
Why benchmark the entire request cycle when the vast majority of issues are isolated at the database layer ?
After I ’ve ruled out the database , I can see benchmarking a single request ( there ’s a great free tool below ) , but I simply do n’t want the other , often irrelevant information clouding my mind .
The root symptom we want to avoid in our apps is slow requests .
Our Scout plugin for analyzing slow Rails requests has been installed nearly 250 times , so we ’re not alone there .
First , it ’s probably not Rails
Contrary to what you heard on the Interweb , it ’s probably not Rails itself that ’s making your app slow .
We conducted an internal survey of the Highgroove Studios team to see where we ’ve encountered performance issues and the root cause :
The database layer has a huge edge on all other issues .
In fact , almost all of the performance problems could have happen in any framework in any language .
Issues like missing database indexes , not using joins correctly , loading too many records into memory , manipulating too many records through iteration ( # map , #each ) , and memory leaks occur in many languages .
It ’s not a bad thing to have performance issues , your web app is growing , but it ’s a problem if they are n’t quickly fixed .
1. Monitor for slow web requests
First , we want to be aware of slow web requests ASAP .
We use Scout 's Slow Rails Requests plugin for real - time notification of slow requests because :
We have a very fast release cycle , and it ’s important that we ’re aware of any side - effects of a new release ASAP
We could analyze our log files weekly , but it ’s too easy to push off a task that is n’t done automatically .
We like knowing about it before our clients
Once this plugin is installed , we ’ll quickly be alerted of slow requests .
Now , lets monitor a couple of key metrics that can impact the performance of our applications .
2. Monitor Server Load
Most nix servers measure a form of server health called the Server Load .
Usually , the Server Load is given in Load Averages over 3 different time periods .
Your Server 's Load is essentially a rough idea of the number of queued processes waiting for a resource to become available .
This resource is generally CPU time , but could also include a number of other factors like Memory , swap space , disk , etc .
A lower number is a good indicator of your overall system health and responsiveness .
The 3 averages are for the last minute , the last 5 minutes , and the last 15 minutes .
Using these averages , we can see how busy your server really is .
If you take a look at the " top " program 's output on the server , you will see that this server is not busy at all !
In fact , this server is currently at 0.00 load on all three load averages .
This is ideal , and indicates an idle server , waiting for a process to handle .
It ’s common to see that when the load reaches a certain threshold ( perhaps 3.0 ) , processes can slow to a crawl and your Rails app may stop responding .
We typically generate an alert through Scout 's Load Average plugin if the load exceeds 3.00 .
Why
A slow web request could cause a spike in the load or it could be slow because a background job is using a lot of the CPU , a large number of requests are coming through , etc .
Tracking the load helps us figure out these issues .
3. Monitor Memory Usage
On the memory - side , there are 2 things we typically monitor on our Rails setups :
The memory usage of our Mongrel processes & associated processes ( like a Ferret server )
The memory usage of the system , most importantly the swap space usage .
It is important to note that as processes use resident memory , they will also increase their use of virtual memory , in step .
Processes will actually appear to consume more of this “ virtual memory ” than the amount of actual physical memory of the system .
This is perfectly normal , since most operating systems can manage in - memory paging and sharing of resources , but , when this virtual memory begins the process of “ paging ” to disk , using swap space to utilize the hard drive to simulate physical memory , do we experience slowness or worse – out of memory problems .
Think about it this way .
If you worked in a restaurant and I gave you a big load of dishes ( your processes ) and 5 really fast dish - washing machines ( resident / physical memory ) , and 5 really slow dish - washers ( hard drive / swap space ) , you would do best to try and optimize all your dishes to be handled by the fast machines .
Only when you really needed to , would you utilize those slow dish - washers , and only if you could n’t handle all the dishes coming in .
Many Rails applications – either the apps themselves or third party libraries – suffer from memory leaks .
As your server uses more and more memory , both their resident memory and virtual memory begin to grow .
They begin to use the hard drive as swap space for virtual memory , which is far slower than physical memory .
This can dramatically slow performance of the entire system , and thus , all requests .
We generate an alert through the Process Usage Plugin if our Mongrel processes exceed a given threshold ( usually around 100 MB ) and if the percentage of swap space used exceeds a given threshold ( usually around 60 % ) using the Memory Profiler Plugin .
Why
This is often an easy problem to fix : if finding the leak is hard ( and it usually is ) , you can do a scheduled restart .
If you are constantly using a lot of swap space , you probably need more memory ( that ’s cheap compared to development hours ) .
4 . Fixing slow requests
So , Scout sends you an alert regarding a slow web request – now what ?
Install the Query Reviewer Rails Plugin
As stated earlier , most of our performance issues are related to the database , and the Query Reviewer Plugin does a tremendous job of finding issues with MySQL and benchmarking the entire request cycle .
The key feature of this plugin is that the query information is embedded directly on in the view .
The Optimization Process
We use the following process when Scout identifies a slow web request :
Login to Scout and view the data across the slow Rails requests , CPU load , and memory usage plugins .
If the CPU load is high , the memory usage of our Mongrel proccess are high , or the % of swap space used is unreasonably high , other issues could be impacting this slow request .
We may restart our mongrel process or check on any background jobs that are running and re-run the request .
Re-run the slow request in our local environment , seeing if we can replicate the issue .
Make sure the MySQL query reviewer plugin is enabled .
Review the information provided by the MySQL Query Reviewer plugin , massage your SQL queries .
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until performance is acceptable .
Summary
We ’ve seen lots of people waste time tracing the Rails stack for performance issues when the cause is usually quite simpler – look at the obvious places first before digging through the Rails stack .

With three crucial Democratic primaries looming , Hillary Rodham Clinton may not be headed toward the blockbuster victories she needs to jump - start her presidential bid -- even in Pennsylvania , the state that was supposed to be her ace in the hole , a new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll has found .
The survey found the New York senator leading Barack Obama by 5 percentage points in Pennsylvania , which votes next Tuesday .
Such a margin would not give her much of a boost in the battle for the party ’s nomination .
What is more , the poll found Clinton trailed Obama by 5 percentage points in Indiana , another Rust Belt state that should play to her strengths among blue - collar voters .
In North Carolina , an Obama stronghold , he is running 13 percentage points ahead .
Advertisement
The race remains volatile , however , because many likely voters in the Democratic primaries are still undecided -- 12 % in Pennsylvania , 19 % in Indiana and 17 % in North Carolina .
“ I could be one who goes into the voting box and makes up my mind at the polls , ” Gwen Hodavance , a receptionist in Paoli , Pa. , said in an interview after participating in the poll .
“ Obama is the best candidate , the best articulator of the mood for change -- but I do n’t know how he would be for president . ”
The results underscore the rough road ahead for Clinton in the balloting in Pennsylvania and , on May 6 , in Indiana and North Carolina .
With the Illinois senator leading Clinton in the number of convention delegates selected , states won and popular votes cast , she is hoping that a decisive win in Pennsylvania and a victory in Indiana will slow Obama ’s momentum and bolster her plea for support from the party ’s superdelegates -- the elected officials , party leaders and activists who probably will decide the nomination .
Advertisement
The poll , conducted under the supervision of Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus , interviewed 623 voters in Pennsylvania , 687 in Indiana and 691 in North Carolina who expected to cast Democratic ballots .
The margin of sampling error for the findings in each state is plus or minus 4 percentage points .
The telephone interviews took place Thursday through Monday , meaning the bulk were conducted just as controversy broke out over an Obama remark widely criticized as demeaning to rural voters in Pennsylvania .
He suggested that for some residents of small towns , their commitment to gun rights , religious faith and hostility toward foreign trade had its roots in their bitterness about economic hardships .
No poll question was asked specifically about the comment .
However , voters were asked about another controversy that has dogged the candidate in recent weeks : racially incendiary comments made by the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , the now - retired pastor of Obama ’s church in Chicago .
The furor prodded Obama to deliver a major speech on race in America last month .
Advertisement
In Pennsylvania , the flap seems to have marginally helped Obama more than hurt him : 24 % said his handling of the issue made them think more highly of him ; 15 % said it made them think less highly of him ; 58 % said it made no difference in their views .
Many Democratic voters , however , see Obama ’s association with Wright as posing a problem for him in the general election -- 46 % in Pennsylvania said they expected it to hamper him in a contest with presumptive Republican nominee John McCain ; in Indiana , 47 % agreed with that , and in North Carolina , 42 % .
“ I ca n’t help but think the church is a big influence on him , ” said Roberta Rowe , a retiree in West Middlesex , Pa .
“ I ’d like to feel completely comfortable , but that one issue there is really gnawing at me . ”
In the follow - up interviews , some voters complained that the criticism of his pastor and the allegations that Obama was elitist were sideshows .
Advertisement
“ All this back - and - forth is not really staying on the issues that I want to hear from ” the White House candidates , said Joseph Robinson , a disabled worker in Lafayette , Ind .
He was unmoved by Clinton ’s charge that Obama , because of his small - town comment , had shown he was out of touch with many Americans .
“ She went to Yale , he went to Harvard , ” said Robinson , referring to the respective law schools from which they graduated .
The poll found Clinton leading Obama 46 % to 41 % in Pennsylvania -- a far cry from the double - digit margins she held in earlier polls .
In Indiana , where little polling has occurred , previous surveys gave Clinton the edge .
The Times / Bloomberg poll put Obama ahead , 40 % to 35 % .
Advertisement
The leads in Pennsylvania and Indiana are within the poll ’s margin of sampling error .
In North Carolina , the poll found , Obama leads Clinton 47 % to 34 % -- a finding in keeping with expectations that he will do well in the state , which has a large African American population .
Among blacks there , 71 % supported Obama , 5 % backed Clinton and 24 % were undecided .
One reason Clinton is struggling in Indiana and North Carolina is that women -- a mainstay of her coalition in earlier contests -- have been defecting .
In Indiana , the poll found women split their vote , 35 % for each candidate .
In North Carolina , they favored Obama , 43 % to 36 % .
Looking ahead to the general election , many Democrats -- including some Clinton backers -- appear to have concluded that Obama might be in a better position to defeat McCain .
Advertisement
In Indiana , for instance , 37 % said they thought Obama would fare better against McCain in November , compared with 18 % who said Clinton was more likely to beat the Republican .
“ I would prefer Clinton , but Obama has less baggage to throw darts at , ” said Eric Beiz , a Realtor in Indianapolis .
“ She is going to have a tough time . ”
Clinton also suffers from being seen as less admirable than Obama .
Even in Pennsylvania , 47 % of Democrats said he had more honesty and integrity , compared with 26 % who thought that of Clinton .
“ She does n’t tell the truth a lot , ” said Brannon Crace , a store manager in Frankfurt , Ind .
“ We ’ve already been through the Clinton era . ”
Advertisement
In all three states , Clinton was seen as better - equipped to handle trade and healthcare policy .
But she does not appear to have been as persuasive in making a core argument of her campaign : that she would be better - prepared to lead the nation ’s military and foreign policy .
Asked who would be better as commander in chief , voters in North Carolina chose Obama , 45 % to 28 % ; in Indiana , Obama was chosen 37 % to 29 % .
Only in Pennsylvania did voters prefer Clinton as commander in chief , 44 % to 39 % .
There are some ominous signs that the party will not easily unify after a long and contentious primary fight .
Fully 30 % of Clinton supporters in North Carolina said they would switch to McCain if Obama was the nominee ( only 14 % of Obama backers would defect if Clinton was the nominee ) .
“ McCain , I like him better than Obama , ” said Robert D. Hawkins Jr. , a disabled veteran from Lenoir , N.C. , who already has voted absentee for Clinton .
“ He ’s a Vietnam veteran , and I am too .
I ’m still learning more things about Obama . ”

How the poll was conducted : The Times / Bloomberg poll was conducted by telephone in three states with upcoming primaries .
Interviewed were 687 Democratic primary voters in Indiana , 623 in Pennsylvania , and 691 in North Carolina .
“ Democratic primary voters ” are registered voters who are eligible to vote under the rules of the Democratic primary in their state , and who said they were highly likely to do so .
Telephone numbers for the Indiana and Pennsylvania samples were chosen randomly from all landline exchanges in those states .
Listed and RDD samples were used to contact registered voters in North Carolina , and were combined so that all voters in the state had equal probability of selection .
Multiple attempts were made to contact each number in all samples .
The entire samples of adults in Indiana and Pennsylvania were adjusted to the most recent census proportions for sex , ethnicity , age and education ; and in Pennsylvania and North Carolina , results were aligned to secretary of state party registration figures .
There is n’t any party registration in Indiana .
In North Carolina , results were also adjusted to the most recent statistics from the secretary of state for gender , age , education and ethnicity .
The margin of sampling error for Democratic primary voters for all three states is plus or minus 4 percentage points .
For certain other subgroups , the sampling error may be somewhat higher .
Survey results may also be affected by combining listed and RDD samples and by factors such as question wording and the order in which they are asked .
Interviews were conducted by Interviewing Service of America Inc. in Van Nuys .

LiveScience Exclusive Scientists exploring caves in the bone - dry and mostly barren Atacama Desert in Chile stumbled upon a totally unexpected discovery this week : water .
They also found hundreds of thousands of animal bones in a cave , possibly evidence of some prehistoric human activity .
The findings are preliminary and have not been analyzed .
The expedition is designed to learn how to spot caves on Mars by studying the thermal signatures of caves and non-cave features in hot , dry places here on Earth .
Scientists think Martian caves , some of which may already have been spotted from space , could be good places to look for life .
No hot place on Earth is drier than the Atacama Desert .
Many parts of the high - plateau desert have never received rain that anyone can remember .
Average rainfall across the region is just 1 millimeter per year .
( Parts of Antarctica are considered the driest places on Earth , however . )
So nobody was looking for water .
Total surprise
The research team was exploring Cueva Chulacao , the largest known cave in the Cordillera de la Sal .
Naturally curious , they took note of things they saw while conducting their primary research .
Other than a single black hair that was likely from an indigenous person , this cave was pristine , virgin territory , explained J. Judson Wynne , a cave expert with the SETI Institute and Northern Arizona University .
" There were no footprints where we were going , and I only saw the slightest evidence of human use , " Wynne told LiveScience by email Monday night as the day 's work was sinking in .
Wynne and his colleagues moved carefully through the cave to place a sensor along the wall , part of their NASA - funded research .
" Much to my surprise , as we moved about halfway through this passage , my foot completely sunk into the soil , " Wynne said .
" It was mud !
There was a lot of it .
It was all contained within the salt stream flow that meandered through this passage . "
There is no known source of water nearby .
The finding may prove exciting for scientists searching for water on Mars .
Water is considered a prerequisite for life as we know it .
" In arguably the driest desert in the world , we ’ve found water in a cave far away from any known water source , " Wynne said .
" Essentially , we found water in a barren area below the Earth ’s surface .
Why was water there ?
What are the mechanisms for the presence of water in these hyper - arid caves ?
Is this merely a phenomenon related to these caves in particular ?
Is there some sort of moisture sink that results in the water concentrating in certain caves and not others in the Atacama Desert ? "
Bones , bones , bones
Another discovery yesterday left the researchers just shaking their heads .
In a different cave in the same region , they found animal remains .
Lots of them .
" We found hundreds of thousands of bones and skulls eroding out of the cave walls , " Wynne wrote in his blog .
" So , we ’ve renamed this small cave Cuevita de Huesos ( or Small Cave of the Bones ) . "
The researchers had to climb about 13 feet up to find a walkable passage .
" This is where we found all the bones mixed in with tree branches , " Wynne wrote .
It 's not clear if the animals were dumped into the cave by prehistoric people or if perhaps they were trapped by a flood .
After all , the expedition is related to figuring out the thermal signatures of Mars caves , and the finding was made just this week .
" Whatever the mechanism for their deposition , this find was incredibly cool and rather exhilarating , " Wynne said .
Pete [ Polsgrove ] and I had a blast marveling over the extent of this deposition as well as discussing what could have possibly led to the deposition of these bones .
Once the sensors were deployed in this feature we moved on . "
Wynne 's colleagues on this expedition : Pete Polsgrove , a Northern Arizona University Ph.D. student in microbiology ; Dan Ruby , associate director of Fleischmann Planetarium and Science Center in Reno ; geographer and speleologist Knutt Peterson ; self - taught astronomer John DeDecker ; expedition doctor Lynn Hicks ; commercial pilot and wilderness guide Christina Colpitts ; U.S. Geological Survey astrophysicist Tim Titus ; and Guillermo Chong , a geologist with Catholic University of the North , Antofagasta , Chile .
The research is funded by NASA 's exobiology program .
Caves on Mars
" Our overall goal is to define mission and instrumentation requirements for detecting caves on Mars using thermal infrared imagery , " Wynne explained .
That means figuring out what caves look like in infrared , and what time of day the heat signatures of caves and surrounding features is optimal for cave hunting from , say , a craft orbiting Mars .
The air around a cave entrance can be cooler or warmer than what is being radiated off sunlit rocks .
“ Martian caves have already been detected through techniques developed by this project , and are significant as a potential habitat for microorganisms and other extremophiles that might exist or have existed on Mars , ” Ruby said in a statement prior to departure earlier this month .
“ They may also serve as future habitats for astronaut explorers to the red planet , as they offer protection from radiation and the harsh environment of the surface . ”
The work will continue in various visits through 2010 , and a similar program will be conducted in the Mojave Desert in California .
China Using Surface - To - Air Missiles to Protect Olympics
China has been preparing pretty hard for the coming Olympics .
They have already banned a large group of troublemakers from leaving Shanghai during the entire event and they also banned all bald and smelly cab drivers .
So just how seriously is China taking safety precautions for the upcoming Olympics ?
Serious enough to have Â set up two separate camouflaged surface - to - air missile stations , with infrared radar systems , Â less than a mile from the 2008 Olympic venues to help with protection for the coming events .
Of course “ made in China ” , the “ Red Flag - 7 ” missile systems can take down a target anywhere up to 8 miles away with a 80 - 90 % success rate .
The Chinese government has stepped up their precautions over fears of terrorism fromÂ Tibetan separatist and the Xinjiang Muslims , although we highly doubt either groups have aircraft that would need to be shot down …
As an added precaution , all people who live in any sort of basement have been forced to move out of their homes and all basements in the area have been closed completely .

For a topic involving laughter , what you 're about to read is not amusing .
Creepy and disturbing , yes .
Funny , no .

1. The Tanganyika Laughter Epidemic
Things supposedly started innocently enough .
Kashasha , near Lake Victoria in Tanzania in 1962 :
One girl in a boarding school there told another girl a joke .
Maybe , " Have you heard the one about ? " or " A Jew , an Indian , and Herbert Hoover walk into a bar … " or " Take my wife , please … " Whatever the setup , the delivery , or punch line , the result was laughter .
Whether it was a giggle , a guffaw , a chortle , a snort is irrelevant .
The listener found it funny .
But then things went dark , weird , and creepy : one girl laughed , but then so did another , and then another , and then another , and then another .
After exposure , the incubation period from nothing to hysteria was short , from a few hours to a couple of days .
There was no fever , no physical symptoms , just laughter and occasional crying between short moments of exhausted recuperation .
When victims were restrained they sometimes became violent .

No one knew what to do .
The school administrators were puzzled , local
doctors were confused .
Trying to put a lid on the phenomena , the administrators shut the school down .
But that was too little , too late : Whatever it was began to spread .
It infected other schools and worked its way into the village , seemingly carried by infected students .
It traveled to another village 20 miles away , and another 55 miles from Kashasha .
Even weirder , it was n't a constant thing .
Like little hysterical explosions , the laughter would pop up , disable small groups for days at a time , then vanish .
Want to know what it was like ?
Well , it was n't funny , I can tell you that : one victim in Tanganyik reported watching it spread around him , hitting one neighbor after another : giggles , guffaws , chortles , snorts – horrible , nightmarish laughter .
Terrified , he retreated into his home .
But then he began to feel it too , a compulsion to join in with the hideous joke .
He shouted and cried and – naturally -- laughed throughout the night .
The phenomena is called Mass Psychogenic Illness , more commonly known as mass hysteria , and although the Tanganyika Laughter Epidemic is an extreme version , it 's more common than you think .
In fact what 's really scary about the giggling madness that sprung from one girl 's joke in Kashasha is n't that it occurred but that many researchers believe it happens so often , and is so powerful , that we simply are n't
aware of it .
Or rather we are n't aware how much the phenomena controls us .

2. The Mad Gasser of Mattoon
Ever hear the one about the Mad Gasser of Mattoon ?
In the 1930s -- all the way through to the mid 40s -- the residents of Botetourt County , Virginia , and Mattoon , Illinois , were terrorized by a surreal specter .
Also called the " Anesthetic Prowler " or " The Phantom Anesthetist , " he was supposedly a dark , mysterious figure responsible for dozens of victims falling ill from mysterious gasses flooding their homes .
Whole families reported sudden attacks of choking , dizziness , headaches and various respiratory ailments .
The cops could n't catch him and doctors were baffled by the mysterious ailments of his victims .
The FBI was called in but they could n't catch him either .
Bulletins were circulated , newspapers warned residents to be on the lookout , vigilante groups roamed the streets trying to catch him -- in short , everyone went more than a little nuts trying to catch this gassy assailant .
But evidence suggests that he never existed .
Sure , lots of people got sick , dozen and dozens and dozens more reported seeing dark and mysterious figures up to hideous no good stalking the night , and the authorities were run ragged with reports but there were no leads , nothing solid ; nothing but suggestion , victims suffering from anxiety and fear , and the bizarre power of mass hysteria .
Here are couple of creative examples , that play on some of the similar phobias :
3. The Monkey Man of New Delhi
Ever hear the one about the Monkey Man of New Delhi ?
About four feet tall , sporting a metal cap and steel claws , he terrorized many a New Delhi night in 2001 .
Victims reported being savagely scratched and bitten by the odd ape .
What 's worse is what happened to people scared of the ape : an unlucky short man was beaten by a mod who suspected him of being the ape , a pregnant woman fell down some stairs because neighbors had shouted that the ape had been seen , and others were said to have seriously injured themselves running away from what they thought was the ape .
The punch line for the Monkey Man is the same as for the laughing girls of Kashasha and the Mad Gasser of Mattoon : it was all in their minds
------------
You might guffaw and giggle about how silly those girls behaved , or how naive the folks of Mattoon were , or how ridiculous the Monkey Man sounds , but before you do too much laughing think about what some researches are hypothesizing : that much of what we believe about the world , about its horrors and mysteries -- including witch trials of every sort , UFOs , some cases of communist conspiracies and so much more -- are nothing but signs of the tremendous power of the human mind , coupled with the drive to become one with the crowd in order to deceive itself .
Now ai n't that funny ?

Une manifestation du parti RWF qui milite pour le rattachement de la Wallonie à la France , en septembre 2007 .
Devenir français et dire adieu à Albert II ?
Apparemment cette idée n'est plus taboue chez notre voisin belge .
Ainsi , 49 % des Wallons se disent désormais favorables au rattachement avec la France , selon un sondage « transfrontalier » réalisé par Ipsos et publié mardi dans « Le Soir » , côté belge et « La Voix du Nord » , côté français .
Plus que le chiffre , c'est l'évolution rapide des mentalités qui interpelle .
Six mois auparavant , ils n'étaient que 29 % à trouver ce scénario séduisant .
Un bémol : 45 % des Wallons se déclarent « plutôt » ou « pas du tout » favorables à l'union franco - wallonne .
Surprenant également , 60 % des Français semblent prêts à accueillir de nouveaux compatriotes après rattachement de la Wallonie à l'hexagone .
Une « divine surprise après des décennies de mépris hexagonal » , écrit ainsi Luc Delfosse , rédacteur en chef adjoint du « Soir » dans son éditorial daté de mardi .
La crise politique à rallonge que vit la Belgique semble donc avoir laissé des traces dans les esprits .
A la question « la Belgique va-t - elle disparaître ? » , 23 % des Wallons répondent par l'affirmative alors qu'ils n'étaient que 16 % en octobre 2007 .
A la même date , 78 % des Wallons ne croyaient pas à la disparition du royaume , ils ne sont plus que 59 % en juillet 2008 .
Une idée de pure fiction mais de plus en plus évoquée
Alors que l'éclatement de la Belgique semblait impensable pour les Wallons il y a encore un an , ils semblent donc désormais accorder leurs violons avec ceux des Flamands .
Ces derniers , qui représentent 60 % de la population , ont déjà manifesté leur attrait pour un tel scénario .
En octobre 2007 , deux Flamands sur trois jugeaient ainsi la scission inéluctable , selon un sondage publié par Le Soir .
Purement fictionnelle , l'implosion de la Belgique hante de plus en plus les esprits .
Le scénario avait été mis en scène en décembre 2006 par la RTBF .
Alors que tout le monde l'avait qualifié à l'époque de canular , la chaîne publique belge avait affirmé de son côté que son unique but était de provoquer le débat .
Quand la RTBF déclare la Flandre indépendante ( 13 décembre 2006 ) :
L'hypothèse d'une scission de la Belgique et / ou celle d'un mariage franco - wallon a depuis fait du chemin .
En témoigne ainsi la publication régulière de ce type de sondages dans la presse belge .
Sur internet aussi , l'idée fait un tabac .
En septembre 2007 , un plaisantin avait par exemple diffusé une annonce sur le site de vente aux enchères eBay pour mettre en vente ... la Belgique , qualifiée de « un royaume en trois parties » .
Le vendeur déconseillait un achat en un seul bloc .
Plus sérieusement , quand on fait une recherche par mots clés à partir du moteur Google , on peut avoir accès à des dizaines de forums et sites Internet évoquant la question .
Parmi eux figure notamment le site du parti politique francophone belge RWF ( Rassemblement Wallonie France ) qui milite pour le « réunionnisme » .
About a month ago , Bush , McCain , and congressional Republicans were without any real ideas about energy policy .
Pressed on what to do about gas prices , the president told reporters , “ [ T ] here is no magic wand to wave right now . ”
In fact , the president repeated the line three times , as if to say , “ Do n’t ask me ; I just work here . ”
But that was before the GOP settled on coastal drilling as the answer to all of our problems .
Never mind that we would n’t actually see that oil for at least a decade , and never mind that it would only fuel ( pun intended ) the addiction we ’re supposed to break , Republicans were ready to do something , whether it made any sense or not .
Oddly enough , on June 18 , Bush demanded that Congress lift the ban on coastal drilling .
The president could have just overturned the executive order on the policy , but “ he said he would n’t do that because he wanted Congress to act first . ”
Today , Bush changed his mind .
Putting pressure on congressional Democrats to back more exploration for oil , President Bush Monday called on Congress to join him in lifting a ban on offshore drilling that has stood since his father was president .
There are two prohibitions on offshore drilling , one imposed by Congress and another by executive order signed by the first President Bush in 1990 .
The current president , trying to ease market tensions and boost supply , called last month for Congress to lift its prohibition before he did so himself .
“ The only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil resources is action from the U.S. Congress , ” Bush said in a statement in the Rose Garden .
“ Now the ball is squarely in Congress ’ court . ”
Bush added that “ Americans are paying at the pump ” because Congress has n’t approved the White House ’s drilling plan .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ken. ) added , “ Now the only thing standing between consumers at the pump and the increased American energy they are demanding is the Democrat leadership in Congress . ”
I ’ve long since given up trying to figure out whether these guys actually believe their own nonsense , but either way , this is just mind - numbing .
I think the Obama campaign ’s statement hit most of the major points .
“ If offshore drilling would provide short - term relief at the pump or a long - term strategy for energy independence , it would be worthy of our consideration , regardless of the risks .
But most experts , even within the Bush Administration , concede it would do neither .
It would merely prolong the failed energy policies we have seen from Washington for thirty years .
“ Senator Obama believes Americans need real short - term relief , which is why he has proposed a second round of stimulus with energy rebates for working families .
And over the long - term , Senator Obama understands that our national security and the survival of the planet demand a real strategy to break our dependence on foreign oil by developing clean , new sources of energy and by vastly improving the energy efficiency of our cars , trucks and our economy .
He is ready to lead such a transformation , ” said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton .
This is hardly worth debating anymore ; it ’s just so blisteringly obvious .
Would coastal drilling lower the price of gas ?
No .
Would any of this oil reach the pump before 2017 ?
No .
Is this even in the same neighborhood as a responsible energy policy ?
No .
Now , I understand why Republicans love this idea .
First , it gives the appearance of taking an issue seriously , without having to worry about facts and stuff .
Second , oil companies would love to do more coastal drilling , and Republicans love to make oil companies happy .
Third , they know Dems have a reality - based outlook , which makes it easier for the GOP to scream , “ Hey !
Dems wo n’t let us drill and it ’s hurting your family ’s finances ! ”
But that does n’t make this nonsense any more palatable .
It ’s a ridiculous policy , which the Republicans know is a ridiculous policy .
It ’s as simple as that .
Senator Richard Burr ( R - NC ) defends McCain ’s bizarre ad that falsely claims that Obama went to play basketball instead of visiting injured troops , or some such thing .
NBC ’s Andrea Mitchell was there in Afghanistan with Obama , says it is n’t true , and finds the ad ’s false allegations “ inexplicable . ”
Now watch this , seriously – watch it :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LifsuCdTnXo]
NOTE FROM JOHN :
We ’ve been harsh on Andrea Mitchell for being a key player in the phony Wesley Clark brouhaha , but on this one , she did her job , and then some .
She was there in Afghanistan with Obama .
She personally knows that McCain ’s ad is a lie .
So what did she do ?
She went public and told us what she knew .
She did n’t play the he - said - she - said garbage that far too many Washington journalists enjoy , nor did she did n’t regurgitate a lie she knew to be untrue .
She called McCain on his lie because she had personal facts that were relevant .
This is what we keep asking the media to do .
Be fair .
Tell us what you know .
Do n’t just repeat the other guy ’s lies when you know them to be false .
Mitchell did a great job here , she did HER job here , and we thank her for it .
Lara Logan at the 33rd Annual American Women in Radio and Television Gracie Allen Awards 5-28-08
Logan : Sure .
Well , that morning in Baghdad , I looked at the clock , and I thought , Well , okay , I can have half an hour more , because I 've only had 3 hours , went back to sleep , woke up , sat on the side of the bed thinking , I 've gotta get up !
and then it's like " Boom ! " and the hotel blew up underneath me , so ...
They blew up the building .
I think they were trying to kill some sheikhs , but , you know , they got a few other people , including a 5 - year - old Iraqi girl .
Stewart : See , even that — the idea of that to me — if that happened in this country , that would be the biggest story for the next two years .
It 's as though we 've become numb .
I mean , there were 51 people killed today , in a Shi'ite neighborhood in Iraq — are we just numb ?
Have we lost our humanity with this entire situation ?
Logan : Yeah , we have .
You know , I was asked once , " Do you feel responsible for the American public having a bad view — a negative view — of the war in Iraq ? " and I looked at the reporter , and I said , " Tell me the last time you saw the body of a dead American soldier .
What does that look like ?
Who in America knows what that looks like ?
' Cause I know what that looks like , and I feel responsible for the fact that no one else does . "
You know .
That 's what I feel responsible for : that nobody really understands , and the soldiers do feel forgotten .
They do , no doubt .
From Afghanistan to Iraq , they absolutely feel — it may be — we may be tired of hearing about this 5 years later , they still have to go out and do the same job .
I was in Sadr City , when it was just going absolutely hell for — I mean , Sadr City was like Armageddon , and there were soldiers there who'd been in - country 9 months who'd never seen combat like that , just thrown into it .
You 're talking about convoys ambushed with 5 , 6 armor - piercing bombs , rocket - propelled grenades , everything — 9 , 10 , 15 - hour battles .
It 's been a busy day for Internet Explorer security , with researchers warning users of separate vulnerabilities that could leave them open to attack .
According to an advisory from Danish security firm Secunia , there is a flaw in IE 7 that can be exploited by attackers to conduct spoofing attacks .
The problem lies in a security hole that makes it possible for a Web site to modify the location of another frame in another window by setting the location to an object instead of a string , the advisory states .
" This can be be exploited to load malicious content into a frame of a trusted Web site , " according to Secunia , which rated the flaw " moderately critical . "
A second issue affecting IE 6 was uncovered by the Ph4nt0 m Security Team , and can be exploited for cross - domain scripting attacks .
The group posted proof of concept details of the attack in a Chinese security E - Zine , according to a blog posting today by Yichong Lin , a researcher with McAfee 's Avert Labs .
The issue is caused by an input validation error when IE 6 handles the " location " or " location.href " property of a window object .
The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute code in the context of another domain .
So far , the vulnerability is confirmed in IE 6 on Windows XP SP2 .
Version 7 does not appear to be affected .
" The issue is very similar to the ' Ghost Page ' issue in IE , which was originally raised by security researchers , Manuel Caballero and Fukami at Microsoft Bluehat 2008 , " wrote Lin .
" We 've notified Microsoft about this information .
Until a patch is available , we advise IE6 users to disable scripting in the browser or upgrade to IE7 to avoid potential exploitation due to the public disclosure of this vulnerability . "
UPDATE : A Microsoft spokesman reported Thursday that the company is investigating both issues and is unaware of any attempts to exploit them .
Let the E3 surprises begin !
It looks like Nintendo is trying to take the wind out of Microsoft ’s press conference sails -- currently going on as I type this -- by announcing a new , surprise Wii accessory : the Wii MotionPlus .
The new accessory plugs into the bottom of the Wiimote and offers true motion control in 3D space .
From Nintendo ’s
Web site :
Nintendo's upcoming Wii MotionPlus accessory for the revolutionary Wii Remote controller again redefines game control , by more quickly and accurately reflecting motions in a 3 - D space .
The Wii MotionPlus accessory attaches to the end of the Wii Remote and , combined with the accelerometer and the sensor bar , allows for more comprehensive tracking of a player 's arm position and orientation , providing players with an unmatched level of precision and immersion .
Every slight movement players make with their wrist or arm is rendered identically in real time on the screen , providing a true 1:1 response in their game play .
More information about Wii MotionPlus and hopefully some other new surprises will be discussed tomorrow morning at Nintendo ’s very own press conference .
Make sure you stick with Destructoid for all the latest E3 updates !
What do you think ?
Are you as surprised as we are about this news ?
What kind of games will most likely implement this new advanced technology ?
" Piracy is BAD " proclaims every copyright dependent industry lobby group .
" Downloading is stealing " is another popular one .
How about " downloads are a lost sale " ?
Ubisoft clearly did n't believe that last one , as they distributed a no-cd patch from the scene group RELOADED as a fix for one of their games .
Piracy can be a funny business at times , but the rhetoric is often extremely predictable .
So when something unexpected happens it can knock you off your stride .
Something like … a major game publisher distributing a Scene no-cd crack as a fix would do it , for instance .
If it sounds unlikely , that ’s because sometimes truth is stranger than fiction .
In this case , the publisher is Ubisoft , the game ‘ Rainbow Six : Vegas 2 ‘ , and the Scene ‘ no - cd ’ crack , yes that ’s there as well .
The situation revolves around that oddest of characters , Direct2 Drive ( D2D ) – an online games store , owned by IGN , selling games over the Internet as protected downloads .
Game code is modified to prevent the standard retail DRM from inhibiting game play ( as there is no actual disc to check for ) with Trymedia activation utilized instead .
More importantly , since the code around the DRM has been modified and changed to a different system , regular patches from the game developers ca n’t be used .
Instead , patches must be reworked by D2D to accommodate these changes .
These changes are not always quick , a point D2D does try and defuse in its FAQ .
Thus we come to Rainbow Six : Vegas2 ( R6V2 ) which , since its release in March , has had three patches released for it .
The third , 1.03 provides a lot of changes , including new play modes , so legitimate purchasers of the game were eager to try it .
The problem is , those that bought it via D2D ca n’t use it .
This is the problem inherent in DRM .
Those that buy the product are the ones affected , not those the DRM is designed to defeat .
After lots of complaining and attempts to fix things themselves , one Ubisoft employee found a solution .
A zip file was uploaded to the help / support site , named “ R6Vegas2_fix.zip ” .
If D2D users patched to 1.02 , then replaced the EXE with this one , they could then update to the new patch .
However , someone ran a hex edit and it appears the fix was not Ubisoft code but actually a ‘ no - cd ’ crack released by the Scene group RELOADED , as shown here .
Since then , the zip file containing the fix has been pulled from the Ubisoft support site , so we ’re unable to verify .
The game ’s community is as baffled by this as everyone else .
Since the claimed origin of the fix , 10 days ago , there has been no word on it officially from Ubisoft , beyond a ‘ Community Manager ’ who states
We ’re looking into this further as this was not the UK Support team that posted this , however if it is an executable that does not need the disc I doubt it has come from an external source .
There ’d be very little point doing so when we already own the original unprotected executable .
As soon as we find out more about this we ’ll let you know .

Although it is not unknown for a Scene release to be used to ‘ fix ’ a retail product , it ’s certainly rare to have that fact promoted .
That the ‘ no - cd ’ patch works , might have some relation to how brutal the Scene is when it comes to the quality of their work , especially in games .
Whilst this is a validation that the Scene is n’t as bad as the lobby groups would have you believe ( they fixed the game , and did it for free ) you can bet that Ubisoft wo n’t be smiling at E3 , and that they , and Direct2 Drive , will continue to use DRM to annoy and inconvenience paying customers .
I love $ 4 gas .
It makes me appreciate freedom .
I watch as the dollars spin and think , “ You , Triceratops , did not get squished by an asteroid in vain .
You got squished for a $ 60 drive to Vegas . ”
So I did n’t go to Wednesday ’s MoveOn.org protests against high gas prices , which included one at the most expensive gas station in the city , the 76 in Beverly Hills .
MoveOn ’s news release explained : “ We want to make sure the world knows that Beverly Hills residents are fed up with gas prices and want a president in the White House who will bring the cost of gas down . ”
MoveOn always understands the problems plaguing Americans , such as the cost of gas in Beverly Hills .
If the group succeeds on this issue , I hope it ’ll next tackle the onerous two - year contract on the new iPhone and how late heirloom tomatoes arrived this year .
If MoveOn and Barack Obama really were going to bravely confront America with hard , necessary truths , they ’d tell us how great $ 4 gas has been for us .
With public transit use nationally at a 50 - year high , traffic dropped 2.1 % in the first four months of this year across the country .
That mileage reduction -- along with people driving smaller cars , and more slowly , to save gas -- could mean that 12,000 fewer people will die in traffic accidents this year , according to a study by professors Michael Morrisey at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and David C. Grabowski at Harvard Medical School .
Air pollution has been reduced enough , according to UC Davis economics professor J. Paul Leigh , to prevent 2,200 respiratory - related deaths over the last year .
Less eating out and more walking and biking could mean a 10 % reduction in obesity , according to Charles Courtemanche , an assistant economics professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro .
And , apparently , higher gas prices also keep econ professors employed .
Yes , it ’s easy for me to revel in $ 4 gas because I ’m rich .
And because my wife and I own a Mini Cooper and a Prius .
And because I work at home .
And because some of the mutual funds I own contain a fair amount of Exxon Mobil stock .
And because I ’m brave enough to ignore the manufacturer ’s suggestion to use high - octane gas .

Cheap gas is unfair .
Driving creates huge social costs in the form of traffic , health - damaging pollution and global warming that are n’t suffered solely by the person buying the gasoline .
Governments usually set up idiotic systems to offset such social costs ( emissions trading , ethanol subsidies , taco truck regulations ) instead of forcing individuals to pay for their own mess by adding a tax to remedy the imbalance .
That kind of tax -- the most fair kind , really -- is called a Pigovian tax , and its use is why gas costs $ 8 to $ 10 a gallon in Europe , where they have fewer road deaths even though they drive like complete idiots .
If the U.S. were to slowly jack up gas taxes until we ’re in the $ 8 range , life would be better .
We ’d not only be safer and have reduced greenhouse - gas emissions , we ’d probably be happier too .
Studies show that the only thing that consistently increases personal happiness is social interaction ; high gas prices have led to real estate prices falling faster in suburbs and exurbs than in cities , so we may soon have more content downtown - dwellers .
Those same studies show that the thing that makes people least happy is commuting , and telecommuting is way up this year .
We could use the tax revenue to fund public transportation .
And we ’d go back to the days when driving a car was a way to show people what a rich jerk you were .
In other words , we would no longer need SUVs for that .
Sure , $ 8 gas is unfair to poor people , but so is all of capitalism .
Rich people get more of the globe ’s resources .
No one has a right to cheap gas any more than he has a right to other things needed for a full and productive life , like an iPhone or a weekly newspaper column where you can tick people off .
We spent 50 years using government money to build the freeways that led to the driving - centric , mall - rat lifestyle I grew up with , so it will surely take decades more to restructure our society into something better .
And as bummed as I am to pay a lot for gas , it ’s a fair price for improving society .
I also think government should look into some kind of heavy taxation on Facebook usage .

Gardeners have been warned not to eat home - grown vegetables contaminated by a powerful new herbicide that is destroying gardens and allotments across the UK .
The Royal Horticultural Society ( RHS ) has been inundated with calls from concerned gardeners who have seen potatoes , beans , peas , carrots and salad vegetables wither or become grossly deformed .
The society admitted that it had no idea of the extent of the problem , but said it appeared ' significant ' .
The affected gardens and allotments have been contaminated by manure originating from farms where the hormone - based herbicide aminopyralid has been sprayed on fields .
Dow AgroSciences , which manufactures aminopyralid , has posted advice to allotment holders and gardeners on its website .
Colin Bowers , Dow's UK grassland marketing manager , told The Observer that links to their products had been proved in some of the cases , but it was not clear whether aminopyralid was responsible for all of them and tests were continuing .
' It is undoubtedly a problem , ' he said , ' and I have got full sympathy for everyone who is involved with this . '
He said the company was unable to advise gardeners that it was ' safe ' to consume vegetables that had come into contact with the manure because of pesticide regulations .
' All we can say is that the trace levels of aminopyralid that are likely to be in these crops are of such low levels that they are unlikely to cause a problem to human health . '
The Dow website says : ' As a general rule , we suggest damaged produce ( however this is caused ) should not be consumed . '
Those who have already used contaminated manure are advised not to replant on the affected soil for at least a year .
Aminopyralid , which is found in several Dow products , the most popular being Forefront , a herbicide , is not licensed to be used on food crops and carries a label warning farmers using it not to sell manure that might contain residue to gardeners .
The Pesticides Safety Directorate , which has issued a regulatory update on the weedkiller , is taking samples from affected plants for testing .
Problems with the herbicide emerged late last year , when some commercial potato growers reported damaged crops .
In response , Dow launched a campaign within the agriculture industry to ensure that farmers were aware of how the products should be used .
Nevertheless , the herbicide has now entered the food chain .
Those affected are demanding an investigation and a ban on the product .
They say they have been given no definitive answer as to whether other produce on their gardens and allotments is safe to eat .
It appears that the contamination came from grass treated 12 months ago .
Experts say the grass was probably made into silage , then fed to cattle during the winter months .
The herbicide remained present in the silage , passed through the animal and into manure that was later sold .
Horses fed on hay that had been treated could also be a channel .
Bryn Pugh , legal consultant at the National Society of Allotments and Leisure Gardeners , said he was preparing claims for some members to seek financial compensation from the manure suppliers .
But it was extremely difficult to trace the exact origins of each contaminated batch .
' It seems to be everywhere .
From what I know , it is endemic throughout England and Wales .
We will be pressing the government to ban this product , ' he said .
Aminopyralid is popular with farmers , who spray it on grassland because it controls weeds such as docks , thistles and nettles without affecting the grass around them .
It binds itself to the woody tissue in the grass and only breaks down when exposed to bacteria in the soil .
Shirley Murray , 53 , a retired management consultant with an allotment near Bushy Park in Hampton , south - west London , said several of her allotment neighbours had used the same manure bought from a stables and all were affected .
' I am absolutely incensed at what has happened and find it scandalous that a weedkiller sprayed more than one year ago , that has passed through an animal 's gut , was kicked around on a stable floor , stored in a muck heap in a field , then on an allotment site and was finally dug into or mulched on to beds last winter is still killing " sensitive " crops and will continue to do so for the next year , ' she said .
' It 's very toxic , it should n't get into the food chain .
You try to be as organic as you can and we have poisoned ourfood .
I 've been everywhere , emailed all the right people , but nobody will speak on the record to guarantee what is safe to eat .
We all think it is a scandal .
Not to mention what it has cost in time and money . '
Pesticide expert Professor Vyvyan Howard , a toxico - pathologist at Ulster University , said it was ' a very powerful herbicide ' but in his opinion was ' unlikely to pose any human health risks ' .
However , advice about its use should be strengthened , he said .
' I think the thing that is going to drive this is the commercial damage that could be done to market gardeners , ' he said .
Guy Barter , the RHS head of horticultural advisory services , said they were receiving more than 20 calls a week .
' Our advice is not to eat the vegetables because no one seems to have any idea whether it is safe to eat them and we can't give any assurances , ' he said .
' It is happening all over the country .
A lot of cases we are seeing is where people have got manure from stables and the stable have bought their hay from a merchant , and the merchant might have bought hay from many farmers , possibly from different parts of the country .
So they have no idea where the hay came from .
So finding someone to blame is quite difficult . '
Weedkiller in the soil should dissipate by next year , but in stacks of contaminated manure it might take two or more years to decay , he added .
Dow is planning a major publicity campaign to reiterate warnings to farmers over usage , and to encourage allotment holders to check the provenance of manure that they put down in an effort to prevent the problem escalating .
On compensation , it was less forthcoming .
' There is no easy answer to that , ' said Bowers .
' The first port of call is always where the manure comes from .
From that point on , I can't really comment .
' The chain is horrendously complicated .
In the cases we have managed to trace back , we might find that the farmer who supplied the manure did n't spray anything himself , but he might have bought in a couple of bales of silage from one of his neighbours , and that farm might have sprayed . '
Robin and Christina Jones spread a large amount of manure over their flower garden and vegetable patch at their home in Banstead , Surrey .
When the potatoes failed , Robin took a sample to the RHS , which identified aminopyralid .
His neighbour , who bought from the same source , suffered the same problems .
' We have lost 80 per cent of our vegetable patch , ' said Jones , 65 , a retired sound engineer .
Raspberries , French beans , onions , leeks , even a newly planted robina tree were all affected .
' We are distraught .
But what worries me is that the courgettes look very healthy .
Had we not had the problem with the potatoes , we might never have realised .
Now we are advised not to eat them .
' This is a very serious issue , and people must be made aware of the advice not to eat vegetables grown in contaminated manure . '
Sue Ainsworth , 58 , an education consultant , said around 20 allotments at her site in Hale , Cheshire , had been affected .
' We first noticed with the potatoes .
As they came through , they were deformed , all curled over and rotten underneath .
But the worry is that the courgettes also planted on the manure are fine - but are they safe to eat ?
This must have affected thousands of people .
I am really worried about this product and really think it should be withdrawn . '
She said the farmer who supplied the manure said he had used nothing unusual .
' But he may have bought in the straw and genuinely knew nothing about the herbicide used . '
Susan Garrett , 57 , an IT consultant , said 20 plots were affected at her allotment in Wakefield , West Yorkshire .
' And that is just the plants we can see are damaged .
We are angry it has been allowed to happen - not with the chemical company , but because there does n't seem to be any protection for us or anything to stop it happening again . '

How to deal with the problem
Do you have contaminated manure ?
Tell - tale symptoms of crop damage include distorted foliage , with cupping of leaves and fern - like growth .
There are no remedies once damage has occurred .
Susceptible crops include potatoes , tomatoes , beans , peas , carrots and lettuce .
How should you deal with the affected area ?
Experts say rotavation is the best practice , or forking over several times as soon as possible .
This incorporates the plant tissue into the soil , where it will decompose and the chemicals will eventually be degraded by soil microbes .
Repeat the rotavation in late summer / early autumn .
Should you replant this season ?
No .
The plant residues need to be given time to break down .
The advice is not to replant for a year .
Why has the chemical lasted so long ?
Aminopyralid , like other herbicides , works by binding strongly to plant tissues .
Once the plant 's tissues decay , the chemical breaks down in the soil .
If manure is stacked it takes far longer .

Ruben has an excellent article talking about satire and the importance of satirical intent .
In his view , the satirical intent of The New Yorker cover is unclear , because you need too much context to understand what is the target of the satire .
If the exact same cartoon was drawn by a conservative cartoonist and published in ( say ) the New York Post , it would be tasteless and offensive .

Governor Tim Kaine of Virginia has shot to the top of the speculated Obama VP shortlist , so in this edition of Pros and Cons , we ’ll take a look at Kaine ’s resume , and what he could bring to a potential ticket with Obama .
Resume : Tim Kaine was born in Minnesota , but he grew up outside of Kansas City , MO .
He graduated from the University of Missouri with a Bachelor ’s Degree in Economics in 1979 .
He attended Harvard Law School , but took a year off to go to Honduras to work with the Jesuit order as Roman Catholic missionary .
He graduated from Harvard law in 1983 , was admitted to the Virginia bar , and practiced law in the state for 17 years .
In 1994 , he was elected to the city council in Richmond , VA .
The city council elected him mayor in 1998 .
As mayor , Kaine was most known for helping to create and implement the gun law called Project Exile .
Kaine was elected Lt. Governor of Virginia in November 2001 , by a margin of 50 % - 48 % .
Since Virginia limits it ’s governors to one consecutive term , Mark Warner could not run for a second term , so Kaine ran and closely associated himself with the wildly popular Warner .
He won the 2005 election 52 % - 46 % .
Advertisements
As Governor Kaine has had to deal with budget deficits , and also opposed a state constitutional amendment that would have defined marriage as only between a man and a woman .
He signed an executive order banning smoking in all government buildings and cars .
In 2006 , Kaine announced a plan to conserve 400,000 acres of Virginia land from real estate development .
He opposes capital punishment , and says that he has a faith based opposition to abortion .
Kaine is a member of Democrats for life .
The most recent approval rating for Kaine is 56 % .
He is popular with moderates , and those who attend religious services .
He was also one of Barack Obama ’s earliest supporters , and the first governor to endorse Obama .
Pros to Obama Picking Kaine :
The biggest pro to Obama picking Kaine is that he is the Governor of Virginia , which is a red state that is already trending Democratic that the Obama campaign seems hell bent to flip .
Kaine is a fluent Spanish speaker who would help the ticket connect with Hispanic voters .
As a Roman - Catholic , he would help Obama with a voting bloc that he has struggled mightily with .
As a pro-life Democrat , he might help with anti-abortion voters who are n’t that enthused about McCain .
Kaine was elected governor on the strength of his performance in several conservative areas of the state , so the Obama campaign might hope that by choosing Kaine they can appeal to those conservative white Democrats who supported Hillary Clinton , and have been very slow to get behind Obama .
Cons to Obama Picking Kaine : Kaine has a thin resume , and very limited political experience .
He has only been a governor of two plus years , and his time as governor has been fairly non descript .
He does not have foreign policy or military experience .
In fact , he seems to lack expertise in any one policy area .
Kaine is n’t even the biggest Democratic star in his state that would be Mark Warner .
Kaine is a relative unknown outside of his state , and his appeal might be limited to Virginia .
A pro-life Democratic running mate would not play well with most Obama supporters , and also many in the Democratic Party .
Many of Kaine ’s positions are moderate , or more conservative than Obama’s .
There could be a problem meshing the moderate Kaine and the liberal Obama on the same ticket .
Odds of Obama Picking Kaine :
The odds are very good that Obama will pick Kaine , who seems to be on the short short list .
I have to confess that I do n’t understand the Obama campaign ’s fascination with Kaine .
My best guess is that after Mark Warner and Jim Webb both turned them down , they see Kaine as their last best chance at winning Virginia .
The Choice - O- Meter Says :
OOOOOOOO ( 8 O ’s for Tim Kaine )
1 O = No Chance – 10 Os = A Sure Thing
Other Shortlist Pros and Cons :
Evan Bayh
Joe Biden
Kathleen Sebelius
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is refusing to disclose records about a new class of pesticides that could be playing a role in the disappearance of millions of honeybees in the United States , a lawsuit filed Monday charges .
The Natural Resources Defense Council wants to see the studies that the EPA required when it approved a pesticide made by Bayer CropScience five years ago .
The environmental group filed the suit as part of an effort to find out how diligently the EPA is protecting honeybees from dangerous pesticides , said Aaron Colangelo , a lawyer for the group in Washington .
In the last two years , beekeepers have reported unexplained losses of hives - 30 percent and upward - leading to a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder .
Scientists believe that the decline in bees is linked to an onslaught of pesticides , mites , parasites and viruses , as well as a loss of habitat and food .
$ 15 billion in crops
Bees pollinate about one - third of the human diet , $ 15 billion worth of U.S. crops , including almonds in California , blueberries in Maine , cucumbers in North Carolina and 85 other commercial crops , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Not finding a cause of the collapse could prove costly , scientists warn .
Representatives of the EPA said they had n't seen the suit and could n't comment .
Clothianidin is the pesticide at the center of controversy .
It is used to coat corn , sugar beet and sorghum seeds and is part of a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids .
The pesticide was blamed for bee deaths in France and Germany , which also is dealing with a colony collapse .
Those two countries have suspended its use until further study .
An EPA fact sheet from 2003 says clothianidin has the potential for toxic chronic exposure to honey bees , as well as other pollinators , through residues in nectar and pollen .
The EPA granted conditional registration for clothianidin in 2003 and at the same time required that Bayer CropScience submit studies on chronic exposure to honeybees , including a complete worker bee lifecycle study as well as an evaluation of exposure and effects to the queen , the group said .
The queen , necessary for a colony , lives a few years ; the workers live only six weeks , but there is no honey without them .
" The public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the EPA or not and , if so , what they show .
Maybe they never came in .
Maybe they came in , and they show a real problem for bees .
Maybe they 're poorly conducted studies that do n't satisfy EPA 's requirement , " Colangelo said .
Request for records
On July 17 , after getting no response from the EPA about securing the studies , the environmental group filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act , which requires the records within 20 business days absent unusual circumstances .
When the federal agency missed the August deadline , the group filed the lawsuit , asking the U.S. District Court in Washington , D.C. , to force the EPA to turn over the records .
Greg Coffey , a spokesman for Bayer CropScience in Research Triangle Park , N.C. , said controlled field studies have demonstrated that clothianidin , when used correctly , will not harm bees .
He added that all of EPA 's requirements for conditional registration of clothianidin have been submitted to the agency .
An EPA spokesman , Dale Kemery , said the agency could n't comment on the documents required under the conditional registration because the matter is the subject of litigation .
Unusual circumstances
Generally , the EPA has taken the position that the bee deaths occurred under unusual circumstances .
In Germany , the corn lacked a seed coating that ensured that the pesticide stuck to the seed , and equipment blew the pesticide into a nearby canola field where bees fed .

The EPA is " reasonably confident " that a bee kill similar to Germany 's would n't happen in the United States because use is restricted to commercial applicators who use stickier coatings , according to Kemery .
But because the stickier coatings are n't required , Kemery said , the EPA will review its policies on seed - treatment labels .
In California , according to the 2006 Pesticide Use Report Summary , about 3 pounds of clothianidin was used , all on corn .
Other members of the neonicotinoid class , registered for a longer period of time , have been used more frequently , including 127,000 pounds on broccoli , grapes , lettuce and oranges .
Some pesticides were used in buildings .
" We 've been monitoring the bee die - off situation for a couple of years , and it's a complex puzzle that may also involve mites , viruses and other factors , " said Glenn Brank , communications director for the state Department of Pesticide Regulation .
The agency is conducting its own review of environmental data from registered neonicotinoid pesticides as well as watching enforcement reports from counties for any unusual environmental incidents involving bees , he said .
None was noted , Brank said .
Scientists presenting at the American Chemical Society national meeting Monday reported that dozens of pesticides had been found in samples of adult bees , broods , pollen and wax collected from honeybee colonies suspected to have died from symptoms of colony collapse disorder , including some neonicotinoids .
Entomologist Gabriela Chavarria , director of Natural Resources Defense Council 's Science Center , said over the years bees have had to withstand devastating problems .
Bees pick up deadly farm and home chemicals when they visit flowers , or encounter chemical drift from aerial and other applications .
Fifteen years ago , queen bees imported from China brought varroa mites that attacked broods of worker bees .
Microscopic tracheal mites invade the hives .
And now the new pesticide , clothianidin , is another problem , Chavarria said .
Scientists must find out whether the toxicity has been sufficiently studied , she said .
" We want this information now .
We can not continue to wait .
Bees are disappearing .
Our whole existence depends on them because we eat .
The flowers need to be pollinated , and the only ones to do it are the bees . "
Colony collapse
Honeybees , which pollinate everything from almonds to apples to avocados , began abandoning their colonies in 2006 , destroying about a third of their hives .
Since then , their numbers have not improved .
A survey of beekeepers in the fall and winter 2007 by the Bee Research Lab and the Apiary Inspectors of America showed that beekeepers lost about 35 percent of their hives compared with 31 percent in 2006 .
Scientists have not pinpointed the cause .
In 2007 , Congress recognized colony collapse disorder as a threat and gave the U.S. Department of Agriculture emergency funds to study honeybee disappearances .
In addition , the 2008 Farm Bill grants the USDA $ 20 million each year to support bee research and related work .
And earlier this year , ice cream maker Haagen - Dazs , who relies on honeybees for 40 percent of its flavors , awarded a $ 250,000 research grant to UC Davis and Pennsylvania State University to research honeybees .

Not eating for 12 - 16 hours can help people quickly reset their sleep - wake cycle , according to a new study from the Harvard Medical School .
This discovery can drastically improve a person 's ability to cope with jet lag or adjust to working late shifts .
Scientists have long known that our circadian rhythm is regulated by our exposure to light .
Now they have found a second " food clock " that takes over when we are hungry .
This mechanism probably evolved to make sure starving mammals do n't go to sleep when they should be foraging for food .
The lead researcher Clifford Saper explains :
The neat thing about this second clock is that it can override the main clock ... and you should just flip into that new time zone in one day .
It usually takes people a week to fully adjust to a new time zone or sleeping schedule .
To think that this new " food clock " hack can help you change your internal clock in one day is mind boggling .
How does it work ?
Simply stop eating during the 12 - 16 hour period before you want to be awake .
Once you start eating again , your internal clock will be reset as though it is the start of a new day .
Your body will consider the time you break your fast as your new " morning . "
For example , if you want to start waking up at 2:00 am , you should start fasting between 10:00 am or 2:00 pm the previous day , and do n't break your fast until you wake up at 2:00 am .
Make sure you eat a nice healthy meal to jumpstart your system .
Another example :
If you are travelling from Los Angeles to Tokyo , figure out when breakfast is served in Tokyo , and do n't eat for the 12 - 16 hours before Tokyo's breakfast time .
Why does this work ?
Like everything else in our evolutionary history , it has to do with survival :
" For a small mammal , finding food on a daily basis is a critical mission .
Even a few days of starvation , a common threat in natural environments , may result in death , " the study said .
" Hence , it is adaptive for animals to have a secondary " master clock " that can allow the animal to switch its behavioral patterns rapidly after a period of starvation to maximize the opportunity of finding food sources at the same time on following days . "
The shift is a survival mechanism in small mammals that forces them to change their sleeping patterns , Fuller suggests .
One starvation cycle is enough to override the traditional light - based circadian clock , the study suggests .
" This new timepiece enables animals to switch their sleep and wake schedules in order to maximize their opportunity of finding food . "
" A period of fasting with no food at all for about 16 hours is enough to engage this new clock , " says Saper .
" So , in this case , simply avoiding any food on the plane , and then eating as soon as you land , should help you to adjust — and avoid some of the uncomfortable feelings of jet lag . "

The new president of the Harvard Law Review was somewhat taken aback by the deluge of media coverage that followed hard on the heels of his election .
The New York Times ran a “ First Black ” headline , which probably wo n’t be the last time that label is affixed to Barack Obama .
The twenty - eight - year - old law student says he was n’t going to run for the office until a black friend talked him into it .
“ There ’s a door to kick down , ” the friend argued , “ and you ’re in a position to kick it down . ”
The job does give him a great forum , but there ’s a trade - off .
“ I like to read novels , listen to Miles Davis , ” he says .
“ I do n’t get to do that anymore .
I do n’t get dates anymore . ”
Still , he ’s philosophical , even briskly cheerful , about his lost leisure .
And that ’s because Barack Obama has a game plan : he wants to tackle the quagmire of America ’s inner cities .
Federal money alone wo n’t do it , he argues .
The deeper problem is that “ those communities are unorganized .
We need to get more people planning . ”
For preparation , Harvard Law School is a “ perfect place to examine how the power structure works .
It gives you a certain language . ”
When he ’s fluent , he ’ll be able to translate the language of the streets ( “ which I can speak ” ) into the language of the Establishment , and vice versa .
The sense of mission derives in part from his experiences in the Third World .
He saw brutal poverty while growing up in Singapore [ Editor ’s note : We should have saidIndonesia * . ]* with his mother , an anthropologist , and his half - brothers and - sisters in Kenya still live hand to mouth at times .
Obama says that his late father ’s experience in the Kenyan government left him a broken and bitter man , and he responds warily to the assumption that he himself will run for office .
“ If I go into politics it should grow out of work I ’ve done on the local level , not because I ’m some media creation . ”
Though , as media creations go , he ’d be a pretty good one .
Elise O’Shaughnessy is a Vanity Fair contributing editor .
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who would like very much to reimpose the old , so - called , “ Fairness Doctrine ” that once censored conservative opinion on television and radio broadcasting , is scheming to impose rules barring any member of Congress from posting opinions on any internet site without first obtaining prior approval from the Democratic leadership of Congress .
No blogs , twitter , online forums – nothing .
This was first reported to me by Congressman John Culberson ( R - Tx ) and I asked for approval to cite him and for any media links to this story .
He provided the following link of regulations proposed by the Chair of the Congressional Commission on Mailing Standards ( PDF ) Congressman Michael Capuano ( D - Mass ) that was sent to Rep. Robert Brady , Chairman of the House Committee for Administration .
The net effect of the regs would be to make it practically impossible for members of Congress to use social media tools to discuss official business or share video of the same with the public while creating a partisan disparity in what little approved messages might be permitted .
It would be a very considerable error to assume that the House leadership intends to let dissenting Democratic members post any more freely than Republicans .
Set aside the nakedly partisan aspect of this plan for a moment – on the technological merits alone this may be the goddamn dumbest thing I ’ve heard of regarding the Internet coming out of Congress in a long , long time .
The dinosaurs who are uncomfortable with computers , the unwashed masses being aware of their actions and free political debate want to turn the clock back to the 1970s .
Except during the 1970s no one would have dared to propose controlling what a democratically elected member of Congress could say to their constituents .
Does n’t it register in the Beltway that they are talking about public information that already belongs to the people of the United States ?
Senators and Congressmen should be interacting with citizens more freely , not less ; the U.S. Congress needs radical transparency not greater opacity imposed by the Democratic House leadership to better hide shady dealings
It ’s a brazenly Orwellian and most likely unconstitutional power grab by the Speaker of the House unlike anything dreamed of by any previous speaker – not Sam Rayburn , not Joseph Cannon .
Nobody .
Nancy Pelosi has finally arrived at a historical pinnacle – as an enemy of free speech and the public ’s right to know .
UPDATE :
Given that I was somewhat intemperate in tone in my post and many questions were raised by the other side regarding the document , I ’m highlighting my reply to those commenters who felt aggrieved :
DNA Sequence Alignment Algorithms : Needleman - Wunsch and Smith - Waterman
In the field of bioinformatics , one way to measure similarities between two ( or more ) sequences of DNA is to perform " a way of arranging the primary sequences of DNA , RNA , or protein to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional , structural , or evolutionary relationships between the sequences . "
Think of it this way : you 've got two random strands of DNA - how do you know where one starts and one begins ?
How do you know if they come from the same organism ?
A closely related pair ?
You might use sequence alignment to see how the two strands might line up in relation to each other - subsequences may indicate similar functionality , or conservation through evolution .
In " normal " programming terms , you 've got a couple of strings and want to find out how you might align them so they they look as much like one another as possible .
There are plenty of ways to achieve that goal .
Since we have n't done much programming on here lately , I thought it would be nice to focus on two very similar algorithms that do so :
The idea behind these two algorithms is that we have a scoring scheme we want to maximize as successive " matches " occur .
One popular
The particular scoring matrix you use will be determined by the goals you want to acheive .
For our purposes , a simple matrix or two will suffice :
@substitution_matrix = [ [ " " , " a " , " c " , " g " , " t " ] , [ " a " , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ] , [ " c " , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 ] , [ " g " , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 ] , [ " t " , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ] ] @substitution_matrix2 = [ [ " " , " s " , " e " , " n " , " d " , " a " ] , [ " s " , 4 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 ] , [ " e " , 0 , 5 , 0 , 2 , - 1 ] , [ " n " , 1 , 0 , 6 , 1 , - 2 ] , [ " d " , 0 , 2 , 1 , 6 , - 2 ] , [ " a " , 1 , - 1 , - 2 , - 2 , 4 ] ]
The first @substitution_matrix is fairly simplistic - give one point for each match , and ignore any mismatches or gaps introduced .
In @substitution_matrix2 what score should be given if " s " is aligned with " a " ?
( One . )
What if " d " is aligned with another " d " ?
( Six . )
The substitution matrix is simply a table telling you how to score particular characters when they are in the same position in two different strings .
After you 've determined a scoring scheme , the algorithm starts scoring each pairwise alignment , adding to or subtracting from the overall score to determine which alignment should be returned .
It uses
It feels strange to implement this as a class , but I did it to make it clear how trivially easy it is to derive Smith - Waterman ( SW ) from Needleman - Wunsch ( NW ) .
One design that jumps out at me would be to have a SequenceAligner where you can choose which algorithm as a method to run - then SW could use a NW algorithm where min_score is passed as a parameter to the method .
Perhaps you can think of something even better .
Anyway , here 's the Ruby class that implements the Needleman - Wunsch algorithm .
class NeedlemanWunsch @min_score = nil def initialize ( a , b , substitution_matrix , gap_penalty ) @a = a @b = b # convert to array if a /b were strings @a = a . split ( " " ) if a .

push @b [ j - 1 ] j -= 1 elsif @traceback_matrix [ i ] [ j ] == " U " left .

downcase == @sm [ i ] [ 0 ]. downcase end for j in 0 . . ( @sm . length - 1 ) break if b .
downcase == @sm [ 0 ] [ j ]. downcase end return @sm [ i ] [ j ] end end
Needleman - Wunsch follows that path , and finds the best global alignment possible .
Smith - Waterman truncates all negative scores to 0 , with the idea being that as the alignment score gets smaller , the local alignment has come to an end .
Thus , it 's best to view it as a matrix , perhaps with some coloring to help you visualize the local alignments .
All we really need to get Smith - Waterman from our implementation of Needleman - Wunsch above is this :
class SmithWaterman < NeedlemanWunsch def initialize ( a , b , substitution_matrix , gap_penalty ) @min_score = 0 super ( a , b , substitution_matrix , gap_penalty ) end end
However , it would be nice to be able to get a visualization matrix .
This matrix should be able to use windows of pairs instead of each and every pair , since there can be thousands or millions or billions of base pairs we 're aligning .
Let 's add a couple of methods to that effect :
#modify array class to include extract_submatrix method class Array def extract_submatrix ( row_range , col_range ) self [ row_range ]. transpose [ col_ range ]. transpose end end require ' needleman - wunsch ' class SmithWaterman < NeedlemanWunsch def initialize ( a , b , substitution_matrix , gap_penalty ) @min_score = 0 super ( a , b , substitution_matrix , gap_penalty ) end def print_score_visualization ( wind ow_size = nil ) return super ( ) if window_size == nil construct_score_matrix # score_matrix base indexes si = 1 # windowed_matrix indexes wi = 0 windowed_matrix = initialize_windowed_matrix ( win dow_size ) # compute the windows while ( si < @score_matrix .
length ) sj = 1 wj = 0 imax = si + window_size - 1 imax = @score_matrix .
length - 1 if imax >= @score_matrix .
length while ( sj < @score_matrix [ 0 ]. length ) jmax = sj + window_size - 1 jmax = @score_matrix [ 0 ]. length - 1 if jmax >= @score_matrix [ 0 ]. length current_window = @score_matrix .
extract_ submatrix ( si . .imax , sj . . jmax ) current_window_score = 0 current_window .
flatten .
each { | elem | current_window_score += elem } begin windowed_matrix [ wi ] [ wj ] = current_window_score rescue end wj += 1 sj += window_size end wi += 1 si += window_size end # find max score of windowed_matrix max_score = 0 windowed_matrix .
flatten .
each { | elem | max_score = elem if elem > max_score } max_score += 1 # so the max normalized score will be 9 and line up properly #normalize the windowed matrix to have scores 0 - 9 relative to percent of max_score windowed_matrix .
each_index do | i | windowed_matrix [ i ]. each_index do | j | begin normalized_score = windowed_matrix [ i ] [ j ]. to_f / max_score * 10 windowed_matrix [ i ] [ j ] = normalized_score .
to_i rescue end end end # print the windowed matrix windowed_matrix .
each_index do | i | windowed_matrix [ i ]. each_index do | j | print windowed_matrix [ i ] [ j ]. to_s end puts end end def initialize_windowed_matrix ( win dow_size ) windowed_matrix = Array . new ( ( ( @a . length + 1 ) . to_f ) / window_size ) windowed_matrix .
each_index do | i | windowed_matrix [ i ] = Array . new ( ( ( @b . length + 1 ) . to_f ) / window_size ) end return windowed_matrix end end
And now we 'll try it out .

Hey !
Why do n't you make your life easier and subscribe to the full post or short blurb RSS feed ?
I 'm so confident you 'll love my smelly pasta plate wisdom that I 'm offering a no- strings - attached , lifetime money back guarantee !
In the field of bioinformatics , one way to measure similarities between two ( or more ) sequences ofis to perform sequence alignment
Think of it this way : you 've got two random strands of DNA - how do you know where one starts and one begins ?
How do you know if they come from the same organism ?
A closely related pair ?
You might use sequence alignment to see how the two strands might line up in relation to each other - subsequences may indicate similar functionality , or conservation through evolution .
In " normal " programming terms , you 've got a couple of strings and want to find out how you might align them so they they look as much like one another as possible .
There are plenty of ways to achieve that goal .
Since we have n't done much programming on here lately , I thought it would be nice to focus on two very similar algorithms that do so : Needleman - Wunsch and Smith - Waterman
The idea behind these two algorithms is that we have a scoring scheme we want to maximize as successive " matches " occur .
One popular substitution matrix for scoring protein alignment is BLOSUM 62 ( and here 's a good PDF describing how BLOSUM came about ) .
The particular scoring matrix you use will be determined by the goals you want to acheive .
For our purposes , a simple matrix or two will suffice :
The firstis fairly simplistic - give one point for each match , and ignore any mismatches or gaps introduced .
Inwhat score should be given if " s " is aligned with " a " ?
( One . )
What if " d " is aligned with another " d " ?
( Six . )
The substitution matrix is simply a table telling you how to score particular characters when they are in the same position in two different strings .
After you 've determined a scoring scheme , the algorithm starts scoring each pairwise alignment , adding to or subtracting from the overall score to determine which alignment should be returned .
It uses dynamic programming , storing calculations in a table to avoid re-computation , which allows it to reverse course after creating the table to find and return the best alignment .
It feels strange to implement this as a class , but I did it to make it clear how trivially easy it is to derive Smith - Waterman ( SW ) from Needleman - Wunsch ( NW ) .
One design that jumps out at me would be to have awhere you can choose which algorithm as a method to run - then SW could use a NW algorithm whereis passed as a parameter to the method .
Perhaps you can think of something even better .
Anyway , here 's the Ruby class that implements the Needleman - Wunsch algorithm .
Needleman - Wunsch follows that path , and finds the best global alignment possible .
Smith - Waterman truncates all negative scores to 0 , with the idea being that as the alignment score gets smaller , the local alignment has come to an end .
Thus , it 's best to view it as a matrix , perhaps with some coloring to help you visualize the local alignments .
All we really need to get Smith - Waterman from our implementation of Needleman - Wunsch above is this :
However , it would be nice to be able to get a visualization matrix .
This matrix should be able to use windows of pairs instead of each and every pair , since there can be thousands or millions or billions of base pairs we 're aligning .
Let 's add a couple of methods to that effect :
And now we 'll try it out .
First , we take two sequences and perform a DNA dotplot analysis on them :
Then , we can take our own visualization , do a search and replace to colorize the results by score , and have a look :
Lo and behold , they look quite similar !
I understand the algorithms are a bit complex and particularly well explained , so I invite questions about them in particular .

thanks for posting this , i remember coding this in Matlab for a course I took from Ron Elber in grad school but it was a lot easier to find this way and easy enough to run from matlab via a " system " command if need be :)

Climate change - induced glacier melts have cost northern Peru 's mountains 26 per cent of their surface area in the last 33 years , satellite images have confirmed .
The reduction is equivalent to 188 square kilometres of the Cordillera Blanca , the highest tropical mountain chain in the world .
The mountain range is home to more than seven hundreds glaciers , with the glacier Huascaran declared a world heritage site by UNESCO .
Marcos Zapata , head of the glaciology unit at the National Institute of Natural Resources ( INRENA ) , says that the glaciers are melting by around 20 metres per year â€ ” compared to a rate of nine metres per year recorded until 1977 .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Zapata was a speaker at the Cycle of Conferences on Glaciological Research in Peru , organised by INRENA in Lima earlier this month ( 18 July ) .
" At present , there are more melting glaciers and therefore there is a relative increase in flows in rivers and streams " , Nelson SantillÃ¡n , a researcher at the INRENA glaciology unit , told SciDev .
Net .
SantillÃ¡n says that , while this currently does not have any significant negative effects , people must be warned about the correlation of this with the increased glacier melting and the future halt in water flow .
INRENA estimates this could be as soon as 2020 .
This could have severe consequences since the population and number of agricultural areas near the glaciers is growing at higher rates than three or four decades ago , SantillÃ¡n says .
Andean scientists have suggested the Paramos ecosystem in the northern Andes as an alternative source of water for communities when the glaciers disappear .
The ecosystem retains and absorbs water in wetland areas .
" The Paramos can act like a big sponge to contain [ excess water from ] the melting of the glaciers , " says Jorge Recharte , director of the Andes programme at the Mountain Institute in Peru .
" If they are conveniently managed they could provide an alternative [ source of water ] . "
A 2002 study by Recharte indicated that the Paramos is a source of drinking water for thirteen million Peruvians who live on the coast .
" Given the difficulty of controlling glacier melting , it is definitely important to work in the conservation of grasslands and high forests located in the upper basins of the Andes to keep some water availability in the coming years , " Recharte wrote .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A picture of an overweight woman lying naked on a couch , painted by British artist Lucian Freud , set a record Tuesday night for the most money paid for a painting by a living artist .
" Benefits Supervisor Sleeping " depicts Sue Tilley lying on a worn - out couch .
The 1995 life - size work , " Benefits Supervisor Sleeping , " fetched $ 33.6 million during bidding at Christie 's auction house in New York .
The previous record was for " Hanging Heart , " a painting by Jeff Koonz that sold for $ 23.5 million , said Rik Pike , a spokesman for Christie's .
" Benefits Supervisor Sleeping " depicts Sue Tilley , a manager of a government - run job center in London , lying on her side on a worn - out couch with nothing to hide her folds of flesh .
Christie 's calls it a " bold and imposing example of the stark power of Lucian Freud 's realism , " depicting " the forceful and undeniable physical presence of people and things . "
Tilley , 51 , said she was initially embarrassed to pose naked for the artist , but they soon grew comfortable in the studio -- so comfortable , in fact , that she confessed to falling asleep while posing .
" I did n't mind if he noticed , " she said .
The painting challenges modern notions of beauty and elicits a reaction from everyone who sees it .
That may have been precisely the aim of Freud , who told London 's Tate Gallery in 2002 that he wanted his paintings to " astonish , disturb , seduce , convince . "
Do n't Miss MME : The art of investment
Though some regard the painting as shocking -- ugly , even -- that is also the appeal for collectors , said Michael Hall , editor of Apollo Magazine in London .
" There 's a reaction against art that 's regarded as too pretty , " he said .
Hall said he thinks a more conventionally beautiful painting would not be able to fetch such a large amount .
" It 's the sort of thing that everyone immediately wants to voice an opinion about , " he said of the painting .
" It challenges conventional taste ... and people do find that rather exciting and interesting to talk about . "
Collectors may also view this as a rare chance to buy something by a prolific artist painted at the peak of his work , he said .
Freud , 85 , has been described as Britain 's greatest living realist painter .
He is the grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and came to London from Germany when he was a child .
With Tilley , Freud said he was " very aware of all kinds of spectacular things to do with her size , like amazing craters and things one 's never seen before , " according to the 2002 interview with the Tate .
He added , " I have perhaps a predilection towards people of unusual or strange proportions , which I do n't want to over - indulge . "
Freud painted the portrait of Tilley over nine months in 1995 .
Tilley said she posed for eight hours a day , two or three days a week .
She had been introduced to the artist through a mutual friend , Australian performance artist Leigh Bowery , who also posed for Freud .
It was Bowery 's idea for Tilley to pose for Freud , so he arranged a meeting .
Tilley knew the meeting was more of an interview for the job of Freud 's muse , and she did n't find out until later -- through Bowery -- that she 'd gotten the job , she said .
" Lucian just said to Leigh , ' Oh , tell Sue she can start next week , ' " Tilley said .
Tilley still works full - time at the job center in London 's West End and calls her newfound fame " a bit bizarre . "
She laughs as she describes how she now has to arrange her schedule to accommodate media interviews .
She said she 's excited to find out how much the painting will sell for , but knowing that it could set a record is " a bit scary . "
" It 's hard to put your head around it , really , " she said .
" But it 's all good . "

As frog populations die off around the world , researchers have identified certain genes that can help the amphibians develop resistance to harmful bacteria and disease .
The discovery may provide new strategies to protect frog populations in the wild .
New research examines how genes encoding the major histocompatibility ( MHC ) complex affect the ability of frogs to resist infection by a bacterium that is commonly associated with frog population declines .
" In the short term , captive management of frogs with complementary disease - resistance genes may offer the best hope for saving species from extinction , " says Bruce Waldman , a biologist at Lincoln University in New Zealand and one of the paper 's authors .
" Management practices that maintain or enhance diversity in MHC genes may prove the key to safeguarding frog populations in the wild . "
" Massive die - offs of frogs may indicate environmental problems that ultimately will affect other species , including humans , " Waldman says .
" But , despite the concern , little is known about factors that make individuals susceptible to disease . "
Doctoral students Seth Barribeau and Jandouwe Villinger , working with Waldman , exposed African clawed frog tadpoles to several doses of the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila .
They examined the number of tadpoles that survived and measured how fast they grew .
Certain genes allowed tadpoles to survive bacterial infection but at a cost , as these tadpoles sometimes grew more slowly .
Among siblings , patterns of disease resistance corresponded to tadpoles ' MHC genes rather than other genes that they shared , demonstrating that the MHC genes conferred immunity .
Programs currently are underway to rescue frogs from declining wild populations and breed them in captivity to ensure that species are not lost to extinction .
This study suggests that selective breeding of individuals with known disease - resistance genes might produce frogs that can survive infection by pathogens , even after the frogs are reintroduced into the wild .
The research team studied the African clawed frog because its immune system already had been well characterized , but as most frogs and toads have similar immune systems , they believe that their results will be generally applicable to all threatened and endangered amphibians .

KENAI , Alaska --
Soaring oil prices are bringing a gusher of new revenue to Alaska .
But for most Alaskans , the new riches wo n't pay for the rising cost of everything else .
At first blush , Alaska might appear to be blessed just now .
State officials say rising oil prices are likely to add to a budget surplus that is projected to total $ 5 billion in 2008 , versus just $ 105 million in 2007 .
Individual Alaskans are expecting fatter dividend checks , which residents get annually from oil - field royalties .
Last year , the checks were ...

When Ken Connor was on Capitol Hill earlier this week , it was clear that people in his party deeply wish that he would go back to worrying about the unborn .
The conservative Christian Republican trial lawyer had come to Washington to testify in support of a bill that would ban the use of mandatory binding arbitration clauses in nursing home contracts .
Most nursing homes today , as a condition of admission , require vulnerable elderly people and their families to waive their right to sue a facility in the event of a dispute .
Instead , they must take any complaints about medical malpractice or abuse to a private arbitrator , chosen and paid by the nursing home , in secret proceedings where any awards are much lower than they would be from a jury .
The arbitration agreements are often buried in a stack of complicated paperwork , where in some cases , they have been signed by blind people and those suffering from Alzheimer’s .
The nursing home arbitration bill is one of nearly a dozen Democratic - backed measures introduced in Congress over the past year that would ban mandatory arbitration in everything from new car contracts to meatpacking company agreements .
With the backing of the powerful AARP , it ’s also the most likely of the lot to pass , and thus , pave the way for Congress to ban mandatory arbitration altogether .
After all , if Congress deems the practice unconscionable for seniors , businesses will have a tough time arguing that it still ought to be forced on everyone else .
That ’s why Republicans really , really do n’t want to vote for the nursing home bill , and one reason Connor ’s advocacy is making them squirm .
Connor sues nursing homes for a living , as a lawyer at a big - time plaintiffs ’ firm known for supporting Democrats .
Just last month , Connor won a $ 2 million verdict against Sunrise Senior Living in California for letting an elderly woman develop fatal bedsores .
So when he testifies on the Hill , Connor is essentially representing the nation ’s trial lawyers , who see mandatory arbitration as a threat to their livelihood .
As such , Republicans would love to dismiss Connor as just another greedy trial lawyer .
But Connor ’s religious - right bona fides simply make that impossible .
For three years , Connor served as the president of the Family Research Council , a leading social conservative outfit , and became a rock star among the GOP ’s evangelical wing when he went to work in 2004 for then - Governor Jeb Bush to defend a Florida law that would have prevented doctors from removing Terri Schiavo ’s feeding tube .
For Republican legislators , Connor has moral authority .
He also gives money to many of them , so Republicans have to tolerate him , even as he forces them into a corner where they have to chose between devotion to industry and devotion to God and life .
While the GOP views trial lawyers as its mortal enemies , Connor does n’t see any contradiction between his profession and role as family values crusader .
Instead , he sees his lawsuits against nursing homes as an extension of the work he did in the Schiavo case .
“ Removing the feeding tube , letting Teri Schiavo starve to death , ” he said in an interview , “ I see this all the time with the elderly . ”
Connor believes that the frail elderly are second only to the unborn in their suffering due to what he sees as a prevailing “ quality of life ” mindset , as opposed to one focused on the sanctity of life .
He says he ’s witnessed bioethicists in Florida argue that if an elderly person suffers from dementia , there would be nothing wrong with hastening his or her demise .
“ If you call yourself a Christian , you have an obligation to fight for social justice , ” he says , noting that , “ It ’s much easier to make the case for the elderly than for the unborn . ”
Connor has now testified twice in Congress over the past year in favor of banning mandatory arbitration , and will be back again next week to testify in the Senate on a parallel nursing home bill co-sponsored by Florida Senator Mel Martinez , the former head of the Republican National Committee .
Connor ’s performance Tuesday before the House subcommittee on commercial and administrative law shows why many Republicans in the Senate are probably dreading his appearance .
With a full shock of white hair , ruddy face and powerful voice , Connor is as much televangelist as lawyer .
It ’s obvious why juries love him .
He testified to an unusually full house about some of his experiences with nursing homes : “ All too often , the story is the same : avoidable pressure ulcers ( bed sores ) penetrating to the bone ; wounds with dirty bandages that are infected and foul smelling ; patients languishing in urine and feces for hours on end ; hollow - eyed residents suffering from avoidable malnutrition , unable to ask for help because their tongues are parched and swollen from preventable dehydration ; dirty catheters clogged with crystalline sediment and yellow - green urine in the bag . ”
He described a nursing home industry that routinely faked medical records and staffing documentation to cover up for its shoddy treatment of its frail residents .
And while Connor invoked the standard trial lawyer arguments about the need to keep the courthouse open to those who ’ve suffered at the hands of heartless corporations , he did it in distinctly evangelical language .
“ Our society , ” he said , “ is rapidly embracing a quality - of - life ethic in the place of a sanctity - of - life ethic .
But , old people do not score well using quality of life calculus and they perform poorly on functional capacity studies .
They cost more to maintain than they produce and they are vulnerable to abuse and neglect by unscrupulous nursing home operators who are willing to put profits over people . ”
“ I promise you that if these injuries and damages happened somewhere like Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib , there would be no end of congressional hearings , ” he added .
“ If you believe that wrongdoers ought to be held accountable for their actions , you ought to support this bill . ”
Even before Connor opened his mouth , Republicans on the committee were trying to minimize the impact of his powerful testimony and to avoid looking like heartless corporate shills not fully committed to “ life . ” Florida Rep .
Tom Feeney , an ardent abortion foe who has a perfect pro-life voting record , according to the National Right to Life Committee , kicked off the hearing by saying that there is “ no more elegant spokesman ” on this issue than his “ good friend ” Ken Connor , who “ sounds like Plato when talking about most things . ”
Feeney went on to say , though , that while Connor excelled at the “ ethos and pathos ” elements of Platonic rhetoric , he perhaps failed on the “ logos ” part .
Feeney ’s philosophy lecture was intended to suggest that his fellow legislators should not be swayed by Connor ’s emotional appeal and should instead listen to the voice of logic sitting next to Connor at the table : Gavin Gadberry , a lawyer from Texas who defends nursing homes from the likes of Connor .
The Republicans could n’t have picked a smarmier witness to support the nursing home industry ’s position .
Compared with Gadberry , Connor sounded like Jesus Christ himself .
As the lobbyist for the Texas nursing home industry , Gadberry represents some of the nation ’s worst nursing homes .
A 2002 study by the House Committee on Government Reform found that nearly 40 percent of Texas nursing homes had violations of federal regulations that caused harm to nursing - home residents or placed them at risk of serious injury or death .
More than 90 percent did n’t meet federal staffing standards .
Texas nursing homes may have been the inspiration for the widespread use of arbitration clauses because their poor treatment of the elderly had spawned a cottage industry of litigation .
At one point , plaintiffs were winning compensation in an unheard of nine out of 10 lawsuits against nursing homes .
Rather than fix the nursing homes , at the urging of the industry ( represented by Gadberry ) , Texas essentially got rid of the lawsuits with a 2003 tort reform measure that makes it virtually impossible to sue a nursing home on behalf of an elderly person today .
( Connor ’s firm closed its Texas office as a result . )
All of which made Gadberry ’s claim that Connor ’s anecdotes were rare events dubious at best .
He insisted that arbitration is “ more efficient ” than traditional litigation and that the pending bill would “ discriminate ” against the industry .
But Connor fired back : “ The nursing homes that are providing good care do n’t need pre-dispute binding arbitration . ”
Gadberry ’s suggestion that arbitration was a benefit to elderly nursing home residents did n’t go down well with the committee ’s chairwoman , Rep. Linda Sanchez , a Democrat from California , whose siblings , to her dismay , recently signed an arbitration clause to put her father into a nursing home .
( “ God forbid anything should happen , ” she said after the hearing . )
Still , Republicans demonstrated that , despite making nice with Connor , they probably were n’t going to get on board .
In a desperate attempt to find an alternative to the bill , the committee ’s ranking Republican , Utah Rep. Chris Cannon , at one point suggested that nursing homes install granny - cams , so that the residents ’ loved ones could keep an eye on them remotely , as a way of improving the quality of care , rather than eliminate arbitration clauses .
Connor thinks the Republicans ’ performance on the issue illustrates what ’s wrong with his party these days .
“ [ Republicans ] failure to support this is , in my judgment , a failure of first principles , ” he said in an interview after the hearing .
He noted that “ Republicans would be the first to say we should hold the welfare queen responsible , ” but they never hold corporations to the same standards .
“ Protecting wrongdoing has become what our party is all about , ” Connor added .
“ And they wonder why they ’re getting their clocks cleaned on the electoral map .
The hypocrisy is breathtaking . ”
PITTSBURGH --
Dude , you 've got to read this .
A linguist from the University of Pittsburgh has published a scholarly paper deconstructing and deciphering the word " dude , " contending it is much more than a catchall for lazy , inarticulate surfers , skaters , slackers and teenagers .
An admitted dude - user during his college years , Scott Kiesling said the four - letter word has many uses : in greetings ( " What 's up , dude ? " ) ; as an exclamation ( " Whoa , Dude ! " ) ; commiseration ( " Dude , I 'm so sorry . " ) ; to one - up someone ( " That 's so lame , dude . " ) ; as well as agreement , surprise and disgust ( " Dude . " ) .
Kiesling says in the fall edition of American Speech that the word derives its power from something he calls cool solidarity -- an effortless kinship that 's not too intimate .
Cool solidarity is especially important to young men who are under social pressure to be close with other young men , but not enough to be suspected as gay .
In other words : Close , dude , but not that close .
" It 's like man or buddy , there is often this male - male addressed term that says , ' I 'm your friend but not much more than your friend , " ' said Kiesling , whose research focuses on language and masculinity .
To decode the word 's meaning , Kiesling listened to conversations with fraternity members he taped in 1993 .
He also had undergraduate students in sociolinguistics classes in 2001 and 2002 write down the first 20 times they heard " dude " and who said it during a three - day period .
He found the word taps into nonconformity and a new American image of leisurely success .
Anecdotally , men were the predominant users of the word , but women sometimes call each other dudes .
Less frequently , men will call women dudes and vice versa .
But that comes with some rules , according to self - reporting from students in a 2002 language and gender class included in the paper .
" Men report that they use dude with women with whom they are close friends , but not with women with whom they are intimate , " according to the study .
His students also reported that they were least likely to use the word with parents , bosses and professors .
Historically , dude originally meant " old rags " -- a " dudesman " was a scarecrow .
In the late 1800s , a " dude " was akin to a " dandy , " a meticulously dressed man , especially out West .
It became " cool " in the 1930s and 1940s , according to Kiesling .
Dude began its rise in the teenage lexicon with the 1981 movie " Fast Times at Ridgemont High . "
" Dude " also shows no signs of disappearing as more and more of our culture becomes youth - centered , said Mary Bucholtz , an associate professor of linguistics at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
" I have seen middle - aged men using ' dude ' with each other , " she said .
Obama : McCain embracing harmful Bush policies Associated Press
Published : Saturday August 9 , 2008
Print This Email This Barack Obama accused Republican rival John McCain on Saturday of embracing Bush administration policies that he said shortchange Americans by favoring an extended war in Iraq at the expense of fixing the nation 's underfunded schools and crumbling roads and bridges .
Obama , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , used a national radio address to trumpet his campaign proposals to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil and to conclude the war in Iraq responsibly " by asking the Iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country . "
The Illinois Democrat pointed to a recent Government Accountability Office report that found the Iraqi government could end the year with as much as a $ 79 billion budget surplus while at the same time spending only a fraction on reconstruction costs that are largely borne by the U.S. McCain will only continue Bush war policies with an " open- ended commitment " that has been unsuccessful , Obama said .
" Let me be clear :
We are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks , " he said .
" Our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in Iraq , even as our schools are underfunded , our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring . "
" Now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that we 've spent in Iraq , " Obama said .
" We could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of American jobs .
We could have headed off $ 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time . "
Obama blamed the nation 's rising budget deficit - which could reach nearly half a trillion dollars next year - on McCain - backed Bush policies that provide " tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest Americans who do n't need them and did n't even ask for them . "
McCain supports extending tax cuts Bush pushed through Congress in 2001 , including keeping 15 percent rates on capital gains and dividend income ; McCain also would lower the corporate income tax from 35 percent to 25 percent and eliminate the alternate minimum tax .
On Iraq , McCain has long maintained that conditions on the ground are a key consideration in any withdrawal of American troops .
" The American people are worse off than they were eight years ago , " Obama said .
" Our government has lost touch . "
" Senator McCain talks about putting our country first , but he is running for a third term of the very same policies that have set our country back , " he said .

Researchers discovered a legless lizard and a tiny woodpecker along with 12 other suspected new species in Brazil ’s Cerrado , one of the world ’s 34 biodiversity conservation hotspots .
The Cerrado ’s wooded grassland once covered an area half the size of Europe , but is now being converted to cropland and ranchland at twice the rate of the neighboring Amazon rainforest , resulting in the loss of native vegetation and unique species .
An expedition comprising scientists from Conservation International ( CI ) and Brazilian universities found 14 species believed new to science – eight fish , three reptiles , one amphibian , one mammal , and one bird – in and around the Serra Geral do Tocantins Ecological Station , a 716,000 - hectare ( 1,769,274-acre ) protected area that is the Cerrado ’s second largest .
The lizard , of the Bachia genus , resembles a snake due to its lack of legs and pointed snout , which help it move across the predominantly sandy soil formed by the natural erosion of the escarpments of the Serra Geral .
Other suspected new species include a dwarf woodpecker ( genus Picumnus ) and horned toad ( genus Proceratophrys ) .
“ It ’s very exciting to find new species and data on the richness , abundance , and distribution of wildlife in one of the most extensive , complex , and unknown regions of the Cerrado , ” said CI biologist Cristiano Nogueira , the expedition leader .
“ Protected areas such as the Ecological Station are home to some of the last remaining healthy ecosystems in a region increasingly threatened by urban growth and mechanized agriculture . ”
The team also recorded several threatened species such as the hyacinth macaw , marsh deer , three - banded armadillo ( tatu - bola ) , the Brazilian merganser , and the dwarf tinamou among more than 440 species of vertebrates documented during the 29 - day field expedition .
Comprising 21 percent of Brazil , the Cerrado is the most extensive woodland - savanna in South America .
Large mammals such as the giant anteater , giant armadillo , jaguar and maned wolf struggle to survive in the fast - changing habitat also know as Brazil ’s breadbasket .
The expedition included 26 researchers from the University of São Paulo and its Museum of Zoology ; the federal universities of São Carlos and Tocantins ; and CI - Brazil .
It was funded by the O Boticário Foundation for Conservation of Nature , with the support of the NGO Pequi–Pesquisa e Conservação do Cerrado ( Research & Conservation of the Cerrado ) .
“ The geographic distribution of some of the species registered is restricted to the area of the ecological station ; thus their survival depends on the good management of the protected area and its immediate surroundings , ” said Luís Fabio Silveira , of the Department of Zoology of the University of São Paulo .
“ From the survey we can obtain data concerning the anatomy , reproductive biology , life cycle , and distribution of the species , all of which help us in future conservation programs . ”
Final results of the study , including the formal description of new species , will be used to support the development of a management plan for the Ecological Station , which was created in 2001 .
“ We need to know our protected areas better , especially the ecological stations whose principal objective is to generate scientific knowledge of Brazilian biodiversity , so little studied and already so severely threatened , ” Nogueira said .
“ Unfortunately , extensive areas of the Cerrado , like the Ecological Station , are becoming increasingly rare , thus making the data collected even more important .
Above all , it is necessary to know to conserve . ”

Last seen in the Sun Valley Lodge lobby .
Murdoch stumbled out of the Lodge bar on Thursday around midnight , where a ridiculously high - powered assemblage of media and tech moguls got sloshed .
Instead of making a bee - line for the exit as most of the guests were doing , Murdoch , married to third wife Wendi Deng , was spotted hunting around the lobby .
He told us he he had lost his wedding ring .
So began a frantic 15 - minute scramble among reporters hungry to please the mogul ( me included ) , hoping to recover the ring and land an exclusive interview .
No such luck .
Still missing .

Honest Money Gold & Silver Report
� The more there is of mine , the less there is of yours . �
Abstract
The long awaited meeting of the Federal Reserve is now history , another page in the annals of monetary debasement is etched into the record , a most hideous and shameful tale , one of wanton destruction to the purchasing power of the U.S. currency or dollar bill , a.k.a. Federal Reserve Note .
Since 1913 , the U.S. dollar bill has lost 95 % of its purchasing power due to excessive money and credit creation by the Federal Reserve .
This loss of purchasing power is a loss of wealth ; it is the reason why the U.S. has gone from being the largest creditor nation on earth to the largest debtor nation on earth .
This is the reason why it now takes two working incomes to support most families � one is no longer enough .
This is why the U.S. savings rate is at historical lows .
This is why health care , insurance , and college tuition bills have gone through the roof .
This is why the price of oil is so high .
And on and on the list continues � like a recurring nightmare .
An economy , financial system , or monetary policy is only as strong as the underlying monetary unit that is the basis of all markets .
If the foundation is rotten , the edifice built upon it is rotten .
It is merely physics on an economical level .
Gold or Paper Paper money is debt ; and one cannot pay off debt with debt .
Debt can only discharge debt � not pay it off .
Discharging debt is much the same as a bookie laying off risk � to another , any other , as long as it is no longer his risk .
Gold is no one�s debt ; it is no one�s obligation , it carries no risk .
Gold has been accepted by man as payment of debt since time immemorial , as gold cannot be controlled and printed or spoken into existence , as can paper money .
Paper money is a whore � an abomination that transfers wealth from the many to the few .
This is why they who control the money power do not like gold , as gold does not bend to their ways � gold stands strong against the control of man , against excessive money creation and debasement that destroys purchasing power � that comes like a thief in the night .
FOMC Meeting
All waited with bated breath to here the wizards of finance proclamation to the people on interest rates .
Would they raise or lower , or stand pat ?
They did nothing , which for the Fed is a monumental undertaking , as they usually screw things up quite well ; although even in inaction there is action that may have harmful effects .
The jury is still out .
As most are aware by now , the Fed has painted itself into a corner : they are damned if they do and damned if they don�t � on more fronts then they care to admit .
If they raise rates housing will take another mortal blow .
If they lower rates inflation will be stoked to dangerous levels .
What should they do ?
Implement a new monetary system might be a good idea � the one the Constitution mandates : gold and silver coin and no bills of credit .
Hard to do many say ; no not really , it would actually be fairly easy .
If they need some advice they can search here : Honest Money .
After their meeting the FOMC released the following press report :
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent .
Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand , partly reflecting some firming in household spending .
However , labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress .
Tight credit conditions , the ongoing housing contraction , and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters .
The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year .
However , in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations , uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high .
The substantial easing of monetary policy to date , combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity , should help to promote moderate growth over time .
Although downside risks to growth remain , they appear to have diminished somewhat , and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased .
The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability .
A reassuring statement is it not ?
Notice the choice of words employed at a most significant cost : � the committee expects inflation to moderate ; uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high ; should help ; appear to have diminished� .
But my favorite line was : �and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability � .
That �s the same line they�ve been using since 1913 , the year they publicly walked on stage , the year they started debasing the dollar bill along its way to losing 95 % of its value ; all under their watch � a magnificent job to say the least : stewards to be trusted with the nation�s future � destiny knows no bounds .
Central Bank Gold Sales
I have read recent speculation in the gold community concerning gold sales by Central Banks and the International Monetary Fund .
Some say they will sell , some say they won�t , some say it doesn�t matters , others say it does .
One analyst states that there is not any possible collusion between the International Monetary Fund and the signatories of the Central Bank Gold Agreement over gold sales .
I beg to differ .
To believe in such is na�ve at best and delusional at worst .
When pigs can fly I will start to listen to such trivial pursuits of political butt kissing .
It is said that the only reason the IMF wants to sell any gold is to simply shore up its horrid financial structure .
Oh really , and how does one know this ?
Are they privy to what the board discusses ?
And , lest not forget the �board � that is mentioned : without approval of the U.S. Congress � the board can do nothing � if the way things work is according to stated protocol � if , being the operative word .
If this is not enough to make one�s eyes glaze over in sheer disbelief and astonishment , it is further posited that the IMF has agreed that they will not cause a ripple in the gold market waters , as they have promised to abide and work under the confines of the Central Bank Gold Agreement .
Why , I think I just saw one of those pigs fly by .
Needless to say , the �confines� of the Central Bank Gold Agreement are of importance in all this � if , they are adhered to and followed , whatever it is they say and allow .
So , let�s take a look at what they say .
Central Bank Gold Agreement Joint Statement on Gold
8 March 2004 European Central Bank
Banca d'Italia
Banco de Espa�a
Banco de Portugal
Bank of Greece
Banque Centrale du Luxembourg
Banque de France
Banque Nationale de Belgique
Central Bank & Financial Services Authority of Ireland
De Nederlandsche Bank

In the interest of clarifying their intentions with respect to their gold holdings , the undersigned institutions make the following statement :
Gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves .
The gold sales already decided and to be decided by the undersigned institutions will be achieved through a concerted programme of sales over a period of five years , starting on 27 September 2004 , just after the end of the previous agreement .
Annual sales will not exceed 500 tons and total sales over this period will not exceed 2,500 tons .
Over this period , the signatories to this agreement have agreed that the total amount of their gold leasings and the total amount of their use of gold futures and options will not exceed the amounts prevailing at the date of the signature of the previous agreement .
This agreement will be reviewed after five years .
The above press release states the working platform that the signatories have agreed to �confine� themselves to ; restraint knowing no bounds it appears ; but appearances can be deceiving � just ask Alice when she�s ten feet tall .
It is comforting to note that the first line states that the purpose of the communiqu� is to clarify the intentions of the signatories in respect to their gold holdings .
Well , that sounds pretty straight forward , but is it ?
First , I suggest that if something needs to be clarified , then it is presently not clear .
So , from the get go , we know that we don�t know the true story , as it needs to be clarified � brings to mind : oh ye of little faith .
Next , I point out that this statement is issued to clarify intentions in regard to gold holdings .
Once , again it sounds pretty straight forward , but is it ?
I guess a lot would depend on just what exactly is meant by gold holdings .
Is anything to do with gold considered a gold holding , or just certain things ?
Are futures holdings , are over the counter derivatives holdings , is leased gold a holding , are swaps a holding ; not to mention � just who is doing the holding , and does that matter ?
You bet it does , just ask Alice , even when she not ten feet tall .
Yes , I know � I have little faith , but then again I�ve studied history for a long , long time � almost as long as history has been around .
I mean the Constitution of the United States clearly states that only gold and silver coin is money ; and that no bills of credit ( paper money ) is to be accepted by states as legal tender .
Well , if one looks around we can see that just the opposite is the rule de jour : we have bills of credit , aka Federal Reserve Notes as money , and no gold and silver coin circulating as money ; and hell , we�ve even got all the Central Banks and the IMF behind closed doors making secret agreements as to how and when they are going to sell gold , or do whatever it is they do behind closed doors .
So yes , I remain skeptical at best , and with more than good reason � there are a plethora of reasons , just look up into the night sky � that one over there � that �s draconis and he thinks he rules .
Now , let�s take a look at the sentence that reads :
� The gold sales already decided and to be decided by the undersigned institutions will be achieved through a concerted programme of sales over a period of five years , starting on 27 September 2004 , just after the end of the previous agreement .�
The gold sales ALREADY decided .
Hmm , now what does that mean ?
Heck , it sounds like they�ve already decided on the gold sales PRIOR to the agreement ; and you wonder why it needs clarification .
P.T. Barnum would be proud .
And , not to be forgotten : they consider gold in the vault and gold on loan to be worthy of the same line on their balance sheet .
And the best is kept for last , as the sentence that winds up the press release states :
� Over this period , the signatories to this agreement have agreed that the total amount of their gold leasings and the total amount of their use of gold futures and options will not exceed the amounts prevailing at the date of the signature of the previous agreement .�
What a bunch of nice guys , they have agreed that the total amount of their gold leasings ( is this a gold holding ? ) and the total amount of their use ( is the use of something the same as a holding ? ) of gold futures and options will not exceed the amounts prevailing at the date of the signature of the PREVIOUS agreement .
Hmm , something doesn�t quite smell right does it ?
Now , how can we be sure of that ?
Let �s see what the experts say in a press release put out by GFMS regarding the above press release by the signatories .
GFMS Press Release London , 13th October 2004
Leasing limits to remain the same
The second Agreement has maintained the status quo with respect to gold lending .
The signatories to the first Agreement stated that they would not exceed the level of lending or use of forwards or futures then in place .
This has been iterated in the Agreement of 2004 .
This should not come as a surprise .
With the reduction in the global hedge book and the expected continuation of that reduction there is little foreseeable likelihood of sharply increased demand for borrowed metal .
Of course this can change in line with changes to market forces , be they internal or external and one must never discount the possibility of renewed short selling from speculators ( which generally involves a borrowing operation ) , of fresh hedge selling activity on the part of the mining industry ( usually but not exclusively against project financing ) nor from jewellers hedging their intake .
The contraction of the hedge book , however and the low level of lease rates with gold effectively at full carry for as far out as one year , would certainly tend to suggest that there is no perceived need to raise the limits on lending .
I beg to differ , and I �m surprised , and I have a couple of questions I would like clarified .
If , it is true that there has been a reduction in the global hedge book , which would seem to be somewhat questionable , as over the counter derivatives are not reported with any transparency , but let�s assume they are ; and that there is a reduction in the foreseeable likelihood of sharply increased demand for borrowed metal , then why do the signatories need to have at their disposal the same total amount of gold leasings and use of gold futures and options available under the previous agreement ?
If , the stated levels of demand for borrowed gold have dropped so drastically , then why do they need the same amounts of derivative insulation and manipulation power at their disposal ?
Maybe , it has something to do with the fact that �of course this can change in line with changes to market forces , be they internal or external�� � damn straight it can change , and has , and does .
It is na�ve to think otherwise .
The following are excerpts from a paper I wrote a few years ago on Gibson�s Paradox , which GATA has done such great work in bringing forth into the light .
Gibson Revisited
On the chart , the 30 - year U.S. Treasury bond yield minus the annualized increase in the Consumer Price Index ( calculated as the sum of the monthly CPI increases for the preceding twelve months ) defines real long - term interest rates .
The chart clearly shows that the inverse relationship between long term interest rates and the price of gold remained fairly intact until something funny happened around 1995 , as the relationship suddenly diverged in the opposite direction of what it had been .
Interest rates and the price of gold are no longer running inverse to one another , but in the same direction � and the direction is down .
As real rates declined from 4 % to 2 % the price of gold dropped from $ 400 an ounce to around $ 270 an ounce .
According to Summer�s and Gibson�s Paradox , the price of gold should have moved in the inverse direction � or up in price .
So what happened ?
Gibson�s Paradox Lord Keynes , in one of his more lucid moments , coined the term � Gibson 's Paradox� , in an attempt to explain the correlation between interest rates and the general price level observed during the years of the classical gold standard .
The reason it was a paradox is that Irving Fisher suggested that interest rates should move with the rate of change in prices , i.e. , the inflation rate or expected inflation rate , rather than the price level itself .
Mr. Summer�s has the following to say on the matter : � The price level under the gold standard behaved in a fashion very similar to the way the reciprocal of the relative price of gold evolves today .
Data from recent years indicate that changes in long - term real interest rates are indeed associated with movements in the relative price of gold in the opposite direction and that this effect is a dominant feature of gold price fluctuations .�
The above translates into English as meaning that gold prices move opposite ( inverse ) to real interest rates � in a free market that is .
Although free markets are doubtful , the rest of the thesis remains plausible , at least for a while .
The Fix From the transcript of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 26 , 1991 , the following exchange took place between Fed Governor Wayne Angell and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan .
Chairman Greenspan : " Is there not any mechanism by which we can create swaps or RPs or something of that nature in which essentially we have fixed the exchange rate of our holdings ? "
Fed Governor Wayne Angel :
� You could have an exchange of puts .
In effect , you could swap puts and thereby assume that somebody would ultimately want to exercise that added advantage . "
Mr. Greenspan : � Well , the point at issue is that it's a [ forward ] exchange transaction that has a date on it .
...
And effectively that gets factored into the market and neutralizes your position .
What I 'm thinking of -- and I just thought of it at this moment , so there might be plenty of reasons why not -- is an open - ended fixed - price mutual put , to put it in the terms that Governor Angell stipulated , so that we can eliminate part of the problem that is on the negative side of the current� .
Mr. Angell : just prior to the end of the meeting said : � There 's one slight addendum to this discussion :
We have a reserve holding that costs us more money than what is reasonably in prospect to happen on foreign exchange rates and that is that we really are not a small reserve holding currency country .
I think we actually have official reserves of $ 85 billion , Sam , compared to Taiwan 's $ 75 billion .
And if you mark our gold to the $ 358 price , we end up with something like $ 170 billion .
There are opportunity costs because we do n't get interest on that gold as we do on our foreign exchange holdings .
That cost is out there also .
I would hesitate for us to have foreign currency holdings that have swap puts that just sit there , which is now becoming the case for our gold . �
Did You Catch That ?
He said , " Swap puts that just sit there " on the U.S. gold reserves .
Couple the above with the Fed 's general counsel , J. Virgil Mattingly �s 1995 statement to the FOMC : � It 's pretty clear that these ESF ( exchange stabilizing fund ) operations are authorized .
I do n't think there is a legal problem in terms of the authority .
The statute [ 31 U.S.C. s. 5302 ] is very broadly worded in terms of words like ' credit ' -- it has covered things like the gold swaps -- and it confers broad authority .�
The Governor of the Bank of England was so frightened at one time that he stated : � We looked into the abyss if the gold price rose further .
A further rise would have taken down one or several trading houses , which might have taken down all the rest in their wake . �
� Therefore , at any price , at any cost , the central banks had to quell the gold price , manage it .
It was very difficult to get the gold price under control but we have now succeeded .�
Obviously , there is no chance in hell that any collusion is going on between any parties , privy or not � of council or not : hear no evil ; speak no evil , see no evil � just keep yourself closed off to the light and you won�t know a thing .
It is also fascinating to note that not only did the Bank of England not sign the second agreement , but neither did the Federal Reserve , the U.S. Treasury , the Bank for International Settlements , nor the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund .
The biggest players did not sign in at the start of the tournament � a most interesting development .
And just in case anyone is wondering about the power of credit swaps and other derivatives , just one glance at the following should allay any doubt : Cui Warranto Cui warranto is a fascinating term , it means by what authority .
It is a good question to ask when anyone or thing wants to assert control or authority over your natural and unalienable rights as a human being .
It �s a fancy legal term for who died and left you king ?
Lest they forget � the reign of Kings is over .
Do central banks have the authority to make such an agreement as the Washington Agreement , and its sibling , the Central Bank Gold Agreement ?
Well , it all depends on what �authority � means .
Does by what authority or warrant mean according to law � what law , whose law ?
In the United States , the Constitution comes before all law , as all law must be in pursuance of the Constitution , or it is null and void , as if never passed � so the Supreme Court has ruled .
As far as international agreements go , for them to have any �color� of law they would need to be in accord with �international law� .
International law is governed by treaties made between nation - states .
Are central banks nation - states that can sign treaties ?
No , they are not .
Then by what authority do they claim the right or warrant to make agreements about selling gold ?
It is supposedly being offered as a noble thing , providing clarity for their gold agreements to sell � agreements , which , according to their own press release were ALREADY made prior to their meeting .
The real purpose of the agreement is to allow them to speculate in the world gold market � nothing more or less � hell , what more could be needed ?
As I stated earlier , one analyst goes so far as to say the only reason that the IMF wants to sell any gold , is so they can straighten out their financial house of disorder and mismanagement , and for no other reason ; especially any type of collusion with Central Banks or other such heavy - weight players in the gold market .
Yeah right , and my grandmother just got run over by a reindeer .
What do you think is one of the real reasons why the first set of gold sales were needed under the Washington Agreement : because the central and international bankers wanted to provide a means for the IMF to raise capital to help debt - strapped countries from going bankrupt � a euphemistic term for defaulting on their usurious loans made under the thumb - screw of the international banking elite .
The day after the Washington Agreement was signed the IMF announced off - market gold sales to raise money to finance its debt relief program .
Go figure , who would have thought such a thing , was possible ?
Newsflash : if it walks , talks , and smells like collusion , it probably is ; either that or coincidence knows no bounds .
Euro -land
This is where it really gets fascinating , or sad , or both � depending on one�s perspective .
Europe used to be composed on independent sovereign nation - states .
Things are a wee - bit different now .
Two very bright people , who had the help and support of very savvy council , have written an intriguing book called Regional Monetary Integration .
In the book we read : � When exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by this Treaty and the Statute ... , neither the ECB nor a national central bank , nor any member of their decision - making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies , from any government of a Member State or from any other body .
The Community institutions and bodies and the governments of the Member States undertake to respect this principle , and not to seek to influence the members of the decision - making bodies of the ECB or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks . �
� Further , the member countries of the EU must make sure that their national laws , including the statutes of their central banks , are fully compatible with this and other provisions of the Maastricht Treaty . �
That last sentence is a dragon - killer of a statement , it almost sounds like national sovereignty has been done away with , but hopefully an expert at this stuff can write a reply and put it all straight .
It brings a whole new light to the term supranational .
And now you know why England never joined , well , at least one plausible reason .
And now you know why there couldn�t possibly be any collusion going on , my goodness gracious � no � never in a thousand years , just ask that pig that just flew by ; and look out for reindeer .
Why do they want to sell gold ?
Because they are scared of gold .
Gold is real money .
Gold is honest money .
Gold is not debt , it is no one�s obligation , it can not be controlled .
Gold stays ever vigilant , watching their every move .
The more the international bankers debase paper currencies , the more gold rises in value � sounding the warning to all who will listen .
They would like to silence its call , its warning � gold�s warning that they are destroying our purchasing power and stealing our wealth .
Listen to the sound resonate , listen to the truth .
Listen to the call of gold � for honest money � for gold money .
Gold goes where no man fears to tread .

When I first met Nicolas Berggruen , I was struck by two things .
First , he was a multi- billionaire I 'd never heard of -- the most interesting kind .
Second , he did n't own a home .
" I stay in hotels , " he told me .
A billionaire without a home ?
This , I figured , was worth a story .
My article about Mr. Berggruen in today 's Journal focuses mainly on his investing life and his push toward socially responsible investing .
But what interested me most was his unconventional personal life .
After making his billions , Mr. Berggruen , 46 , lost interest in acquiring things :
They did n't satisfy him , and in fact had become something of a burden .
So he started paring down his material life , selling off his condo in New York , his mansion in Florida and his only car .
He hatched plans to leave his fortune to charity and his art collection to a new museum in Berlin .
For him , wealth is about lasting impact , not stuff .
East Siberia 's permafrost contains about 500 Gigatons ( 1100 trillion pounds ) of frozen carbon deposits that are highly susceptible to disturbances as the climate warms .
Called the Yedoma , this permafrost has not undergone much alteration by soil microorganisms since its formation , which took place between 20,000 and 40,000 years ago .
To investigate how easily this huge carbon stock could be degassed in future warming scenarios , Khvorostyanov et al .
use a model of heat transfer and soil organic matter decomposition in frozen soils and find that specific conditions trigger the irreversible thawing of Yedoma , which is maintained by heat production by soil microbial activity .
Once started , irreversible thawing could release 4.4- 6.2 trillion pounds of carbon per year into the atmosphere between the years 2300 and 2400 , transforming 74 percent of the initial carbon stock into carbon dioxide and methane .
Further investigations reveal that the faster the planet 's surface warms , the sooner fast deep - soil decomposition will start , although the tipping point above which soil carbon starts irreversible mobilization due to permafrost thawing increases slightly with larger external warming rates .
Kucinich 's July 4th message :
Help me restore ' rule of law in America ' Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 4 , 2008
Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) has been at the forefront of the attempt to push for the impeachment of President George W. Bush and last month presented 35 articles of impeachment to Congress .
Now Kucinich has released an Independence Day message which invokes the words of Abraham Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address to urge support for impeachment and the restoration of the rule of law .
" Some Democratic leaders say impeachment 's off the table , " Kucinich begins .
" So let 's set a new table for our nation , upon which we place the Constitution , and where we demand that all those who 've taken an oath to defend it keep their promise and protect our nation from the threat within .
Please go to kucinich.us now and sign the petition which calls for impeachment .
This is the one petition that will make a difference because I will be personally delivering it to your member of Congress . "
" Two hundred thirty two years ago , our nation was ' conceived in liberty , ' continues Kucinich , quoting Lincoln 's famous phrase .
" We have once again reached a moment of truth , one that Lincoln recognized at Gettysburg , as to ' whether this nation , or any nation so conceived or so dedicated , can long endure . ' "
" Through the ashes of the Civil War , " he goes on , " Lincoln prayed ' that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people , by the people , and for the people shall not perish from the earth . '
This 4th of July 2008 , we face a different kind of war , one which is trying our souls , a war based on lies . "
" With the power of truth , the power of the people , " Kucinich concludes , " we can achieve a new birth of freedom . "
As the strains of " America the Beautiful " swell in the background , he urges , " Be the answer to Lincoln 's prayer .
Please pledge your support now for restoring the rule of law in America .
As we once again celebrate Independence Day , let us celebrate freedom from fear and pledge that this government of the people will survive in this land that we love . "
Meanwhile , President Bush delivered a July 4th address before a naturalization ceremony for new citizens at Thomas Jefferson 's home of Monticello that was repeatedly interrupted by protesters .
According to news accounts , " shouts from protesters were heard during Bush 's remarks , " while a transcript notes repeated occurrences all through the speech of " Audience disturbance , " " Audience interruption , " and " Audience interruption continues . "
RAW STORY has more on the protest at this link .

We 've seen countless attempts to re-invent the Post - It note , but no one 's ever really managed to improve on the basic design -- which might be why MIT 's " Quickies " concept does n't even try .
The electronic note system is instead based around a digital pen and special pad , which saves your notes as you jot them down on RFID - embedded Post - Its .
Software on your PC then does some quick OCR and , according to the inventors , " uses its understanding of the user 's intentions , content , and the context of the notes to provide the user with reminders , alerts , messages , and just - in - time information . "
Since the database can also store location information , sticking the note on a book or other object allows you to locate it later using the RFID tag , and you can even have notes SMS'd to their recipients .
Pretty wild -- but we 're more impressed someone finally found a good use for all those digital pens out there .

It is a common phenomenon for rubber o-rings to extrude especially with present day fluid systems that are a combination ..
Rubber O-rings generally serve as effective seals for dynamic and static applications in hydraulic and pneumatic systems equipment .
One big drawback of rubber O - rings is their tendency to extrude into the clearance of mating surfaces ..

Significances of O - Rings :
O -rings are dough nut - sha ped devices manufactured from elastomeric compounds such as synthetic or natural rubber .
They are one of the most widely used seals in machine design as they are reasonably priced , easy - to - make , reliable , and have simple mounting requirements .
O-rings are widely used in mechanical setups to seal liquid or air flows .
They can be easily fixed in to the cavities / grooves , and deform accordingly to stop the flow of fluid movement .
These cavities are called glands and are used in one of the two seal designs - axial and radial .
An O -ring is marked by its inner diameter , its cross-section diameter , material composition and its material hardness .

TOKYO -- Sony Corp. is releasing a new safari game this week for its PlayStation 3 videogame console that purposely steers clear of attributes found in most popular videogames :
It has no shooting , little action , no winning or losing , and not even an ending .
Players simply observe wild animals in the savanna and take virtual photos .
But Sony is hoping that the game , called Afrika , will impress players with its advanced graphics .
The developers , who spent nearly four years creating the game -- including two visits to Africa ...
Retired General Antonio Taguba , the officer who led the Army ’s investigation into Abu Ghraib , recently wrote in the preface to the new report , Broken laws , Broken Lives :
“ There is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes .
The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account .
” Should those who ordered war crimes be held to account ?
With the conclusion of the Bush regime approaching , many people are dubious , even those horrified by Administration actions .
They fear a long , divisive ordeal that could tear the country apart .
They note that such division could make it far harder for the country to address the many other crises it is facing .
They see the upcoming elections as a better way to set the country on a new path .
Many Democrats in particular are proposing to let bygones be bygones and move on to confront the problems of the future , rather than dwelling on the past .
The Democratic leadership sees rising gas prices , foreclosures , and health care costs , as well as widespread dissatisfaction with the direction of the country , as playing in their favor .
Why risk it all by playing the war crimes blame game ?
Perhaps some Democratic leaders are also concerned that their own role in enabling or even encouraging war crimes might be exposed .
Meanwhile , the evidence confirming not only a deliberate policy of torture , but of conspiring in an illegal war of aggression and conducting a criminal occupation , continues to pile ever higher .
Bush ’s own press secretary Scott McClellan has revealed in his book , What Happened , how deliberately the public was misled to foment the attack on Iraq .
Philippe Sands ’ new book , Torture Team , has shown how the top legal and political leadership fought for a policy of torture – circumventing and misleading top military officials to do so .
Jane Mayer ’s
The Dark Side , reveals that a secret report by the Red Cross – given to the CIA and shared with President Bush and Condoleezza Rice – found that U.S. interrogation methods are “ categorically ” torture and that the “ abuse constituted war crimes , placing the highest officials in the U.S. government in jeopardy of being prosecuted . ”
Despite the reluctance to open what many see as a can of worms , there are fresh moves on many fronts to hold top U.S. officials accountable for war crimes .
Courts : U.S. courts have issued a barrage of decisions against the Administration ’s claim that they can do anything and still be within the law .
The Supreme Court ruled June 12 that the Administration cannot deny habeas corpus rights to GuantÃ¡namo detainees .
The DC Circuit Court of Appeals on June 30 overturned the Pentagon ’s enemy combatant designation of a Chinese Muslim held in GuantÃ¡namo for the last six years .
A Maine jury in April acquitted the Bangor Six of criminal trespass charges stemming from protesters ’ claim that the “ Constitution was being violated by the Bush Administration ’s involvement in Iraq . ”
Congressional investigation : Rep. John Conyers has recently brought top policy - makers , including former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo , Vice President Cheney ’s Chief of Staff David Addington , and this week former Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith and former Attorney General John Ashcroft before a House Judiciary subcommittee and grilled them on their role crafting the Administration ’s torture policy .
Senate hearings in June revealed that treatment of GuantÃ¡namo captives was modeled on techniques allegedly used by Communist China to force false confessions from U.S. soldiers .
Impeachment : Despite Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi ’s instruction to keep impeachment “ off the table , ” Rep. Dennis Kucinich for the first time brought an impeachment resolution to the House floor that incorporated a devastating , thirty - five article indictment spelling out Bush Administration war crimes and crimes against the Constitution .
Now Rep. Conyers has announced that the Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on the charges July 25 .
Even after the Bush Administration leaves office , the judges it appointed who appear complicit in war crimes – notably torture policy architect Judge Jay S. Bybee – could still be impeached .
Truth commission :
In response to General Taguba ’s accusations , New York Times Op - Ed columnist Nicholas D. Kristof has just called for the establishment of a truth commission – like that of post - Apartheid South Africa – with subpoena power to investigate the abuses in the aftermath of 9/11 and “ lead a process of soul searching and national cleansing . ”
International : In May , Vanity Fair magazine published an article by British human rights attorney Philippe Sands , in which he described the reasons Administration lawyers face a real risk of criminal investigations if they stray beyond U.S. borders .
The British parliament is about to launch an investigation of Washington ’s lying to the British government about its use of its facilities for “ extraordinary rendition . ”
Constitutional lawyer Jonathan
Turley recently said , “ I think it might in fact be time for the United States to be held internationally to a tribunal .
I never thought in my lifetime I would say that . ”
Colin Powell ’s former chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson publicly advised Feith , Addington , And Albert Gonzales “ never to travel outside the U.S. , except perhaps to Saudi Arabia and Israel . ”
Prosecution : According to a recent Mellman Group survey commissioned by the American Civil Liberties Union , Americans of all political stripes overwhelmingly support the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate both the destruction of the CIA ’s interrogation tapes and the possible use of torture by the agency .
Every segment of the electorate – including majorities of Democrats ( 82 percent ) , independents ( 62 percent ) , and Republicans ( 51 percent ) – want to hold this administration accountable for its role in the destruction of the torture tapes .
Vincent Bugliosi , the former Los Angeles County Prosecutor who has won twenty - one convictions in murder trials , including Charles Manson ’s , has just published The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder , which argues that there is overwhelming evidence President Bush took the nation to war in Iraq under false pretenses and must be prosecuted for the consequent deaths of over 4,000 U.S. soldiers .
Dean Lawrence Velvel of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover is planning a September conference to map out war crimes prosecutions against President Bush and other administration officials .
Velvel says that “ plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up , to pursue the guilty as long as necessary and , if need be , to the ends of the Earth . ”
Reps. John Conyers , Jerrold Nadler , and Bill Delahunt have called on Attorney General Michael Mukasey to appoint a special counsel to investigate the rendition of Canadian citizen Maher Arar to Syria .
Citizen action : Voters in Brattleboro and Marlboro , Vermont this spring approved a measure that instructs police to arrest President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for “ crimes against our Constitution , ” should they venture into those precincts .
All these developments suggest approaches that might be used to hold Bush Administration war criminals accountable .
Establishing accountability for U.S. war crimes in the Iraq war era is the sine qua non for initiating a new era on different principles .
Here are nine reasons why we must not let bygones be bygones :
1. World peace cannot be achieved without human rights and accountability .
According to Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson , chief American prosecutor at the Nuremberg Tribunals , “ The ultimate step in avoiding periodic wars , which are inevitable in a system of international lawlessness , is to make statesmen responsible to law . ”
Moving in that direction will be impossible unless such responsibility applies to the statesmen of the world ’s most powerful countries , and above all the world ’s sole superpower .
U.S. support for the war crimes charges like those just brought by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court against Sudanese President Omar al - Bashir will represent little more than hypocrisy if U.S. Presidents are not held to the same standard .
2 . The rule of law is central to our democracy .
Most Americans believe that even the highest officials are bound by law .
If we send mentally - disabled juveniles to prison as adults , but let government officials who authorize torture and launch illegal wars go scot - free , we destroy the very basis of the rule of law .
3 . We must not allow precedents to be set that promote war crimes .
Executive action unchallenged by Congress changes the way our law is interpreted .
According to Robert Borosage , writing for Huffington Post , “ If Bush ’s extreme assertions of power are not challenged by the Congress , they end up not simply creating new law , they could end up rewriting the Constitution itself . ”
4 . We must restore the principles of democracy to our government .
The claim that the President , as commander - in - chief , can exercise the unlimited powers of a king or dictator strikes at the very heart of our democracy .
As Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson put it , we , as citizens , would “ submit ourselves to rules only if under rules . ”
Countries like Chile can attest that the restoration of democracy and the rule of law requires more than voting a new party into office – it requires a rejection of impunity for the criminal acts of government officials .
5 . We must forestall an imperialist resurgence .
When they are out of office , the advocates of imperial expansion and global domination have proven brilliant at lying in wait to undermine and destroy their opponents .
They did it to destroy the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton .
They ’ll do it again to an Obama Administration unless their machinations are exposed and discredited first .
6 . We must have national consensus on the real reasons for the Bush Administration ’s failures .
Republicans are preparing to dominate future decades of American politics by blaming the failure of the Iraq war on those who “ sent a signal ” that the U.S. would not “ stay the course ” whatever the cost .
Establishing the real reasons for the failure of the U.S. in Iraq – the criminal and anti-democratic character of the war – is the necessary condition for defeating that effort .
7 . We must restore America ’s damaged reputation abroad .
The world has watched as the United States – the self - proclaimed steward of democracy – has systematically broken the letter and spirit of its Constitution , violated international treaties , and ignored basic moral tenets of humanity .
As former Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora recently pointed out to the Senate Armed Services Committee , our nation ’s “ policy of cruelty ” has violated our “ overarching foreign policy interests and our national security . ”
To establish international legitimacy , we must demonstrate that we are capable of holding our leaders to account .
8 . We must lay the basis for major change in U.S. foreign policy .
Real security in the era of global warming and nuclear proliferation must be based on international cooperation .
But genuine cooperation requires that the U.S. entirely repudiate the course of the past eight years .
The American people must understand why international cooperation rather than pursuit of global domination is necessary to their own security .
And other countries must be convinced that we really mean it .
9 . We must deter future U.S. war crimes .
The specter of more war crimes haunts our future .
Rumors continue to circulate about an American or American - backed Israeli attack on Iran .
A recently introduced House resolution promoted by AIPAC “ demands ” that the President initiate what is effectively a blockade against Iran – an act seen by some as tantamount to a declaration of war .
Nothing could provide a greater deterrent to such future war crimes than establishing accountability for those of the past .
Holding war criminals accountable will require placing the long - term well - being of our country and the world ahead of short - term political advantage .
As Rep .
Wexler put it , “ We owe it to the American people and history to pursue the wrongdoing of this Administration whether or not it helps us politically or in the next election .
Our actions will properly define the Bush Administration in the eyes of history and that is the true test . ”
SPECIAL FEATURE JIM MALLON SPEAKS !
Jim Mallon , who arguably had more to do with shaping MST3K over its 11 - years on TV than anybody , is perhaps the least - known member of Best Brains .
So we were delighted when Jim recently contacted us and suggested an interview with no preconditions or off - limits topics .
We think the result was an eye - opener , and we bet you will too .
Q : Comic - Con will be your first public appearance in , what , 12 years ?
Are you nervous ?
Do you have any idea what to expect ?
A : Being part of MST3K has always been a great honor for me , and getting together with the entire creative team after all these years to celebrate the 20th anniversary and the first Shout !
Factory DVD release is really pretty cool .
Q : Give us a little of your background :
We do n’t know much about you before your college days .
Where did you grow up , go to school , that sort of thing .
What did you want to be when you grew up ?
A : I grew up in Rochester , Minn. , where my dad was an engineer for IBM .
I started making comedy movies in the fifth grade .
I was inspired by “ Laugh - In , ” and my friend had a regular 8 mm camera .
When I was in seventh grade , Sony came out with the first inexpensive b/w reel to reel video gear .
Our junior high bought one , and I was hooked .
Later , in high school , I made a parody of Mutual of Omaha ’s Wild Kingdom and put it on public access .
Q : Your exploits at UW - Madison are legendary at this point .
What ’s the one thing about the whole Pail & Shovel experience that you remember most fondly , and what was the worst thing about it ?
A : The best part of that experience was the day - to - day fun of coming up with great ideas and having the resources and team to do them - from bringing the Statue of Liberty to Madison to planting 1,000 pink flamingos on Bascom Hill to the World ’s Largest Toga Party .
The media loved what we did and magnified the results .
The worst thing was being told by a University engineer that the portable generator was about to blow , and that we were about to lose all of the lights illuminating 10,000 drunk students at our Toga Party !
Q : When and how did you meet Kevin Murphy ?
A : Kevin and I met at WHA - TV in Madison .
He was working on the remote truck crew , and I was the single camera film / video department .
Later I hired him as a key grip on Blood Hook and eventually as the videographer at KTMA .
Q : How did you end up at KTMA ?
A : They put an ad in the newspaper for a “ film director . ”
Having just finished directing Blood Hook , I happened to be one !
Really what they wanted was someone to screen the movies in their library , but they took a look at my resume and offered me the Production Manager job .
I grabbed the job because aside from paying the bills , it provided access to production gear .
Camcorders and IMovie were still a long way off .
Q : When did you first become aware of Joel Hodgson and how did you two first meet ?
A : I met Joel at the warehouse where we were editing Blood Hook .
He had a space adjacent to ours .
Q : How did you feel about being thrust into puppeteering ?
Had you ever done it before ?
A : I had done tons of puppeteering through grade school and a fair amount of acting in Rochester ’s Children ’s
Theater from grade school through high school , so it was actually pretty easy for me .
The hardest part was figuring out how to deal with Gypsy ’s huge size .
Eventually I built a harness that solved that problem .
Q : Here ’s a question every MSTie has wanted to ask you for 15 years or more :
Do you , in fact , own copies of the first three KTMA episodes ?
A : In fact , I do !
I just saw the 3/4 ” cassettes last week .
Q : Is it possible , then , that the host segments ( since the movie segments would have rights issues ) from those episodes could someday be released ?
MSTie completionists out there are dying to know .
A : Yes .
We ’d like to put some of them up on mst3 k.com .
Because of the age of the tapes and the format , though , we need to find a facility to help us make the Quicktime files .
3/4 ” machines regularly ate the tapes when the format was new .
I would hate to have that happen now .
Q : Back in the days when you were always promoting your latest product , you ( and I mean Best Brains in general , not just you in particular ) called KTMA , and even Season One , a “ work in progress ” and tried to direct fans toward the later work .
But now that you do n’t have those commercial forces working on you so much , how do you feel about those old shows when you look back on them ?
Have you reconsidered your opinion of them ?
A : Well , I have n’t looked at a KTMA episode in years .
The main difference was that they were improvisational - we had no resources to review the work before or after .
So in general , my memory is that they were very uneven and rough , with flashes of genius .
I was watching a Frank Lloyd Wright documentary this past weekend .
His early work is clearly not his best but it ’s fascinating knowing that they were steps on his path .
In that sense I can understand why people who are really into MST think these shows are fun to look at .
Q : The KTMA period has been pretty well chronicled , but is there something about that time that you think fans have never heard about ?
A : KTMA itself could have been , and perhaps should have been , the basis for a sitcom !
Basically , the station existed as get - rich scheme .
The owners bought the place and attempted to juice up its ratings so they could flip the station and make a fortune .
It is one reason MST had such bad movies to work with , as KTMA had a tiny program budget and therefore had purchased some of the cheapest movie packages on the market .
It was just crazy .
For example , the chief engineer had been given the vending machine concession , so he made sure those machines ran perfectly while we did not even have frame - accurate editing in our edit suite .
Also , the sales staff worked so much out of a certain saloon that the bar put up a plaque commemorating that “ satellite ” office .
Q : Tell us about the fateful meeting in New York with the HBO and Comedy Channel people when you sold the show .
What went on there ?
A : I do n’t have clear memories of a specific meeting .
All I remember was the chaos of people running around dropping in and out of meetings .
They had seen our demo and wanted the show , but not without all sorts of ridiculous changes .
I do remember a very somber Stu Smiley saying that we needed to straighten out our agent if we wanted this deal to happen .
Actually , our agent , Rick Leed , really should be credited with preserving the series by getting us the copyright , something that would be unheard of today .
Q : Painfully nerdy MST3K question :
In the ACEG , it ’s explained that Episode 104 , Women of the Prehistoric Planet , was in fact the LAST episode shot in Season One , despite its sequence number .
But the reason is never given .
I know it was almost 20 years ago - do you even remember anymore what happened ?
A : My memory is there was a sense on the network level that we got better as the show went on .
So I vaguely remember them re-ordering the shows to put the “ better ” shows first .
Q : The story of how Josh Weinstein discovered Mike Nelson , and his quick rise from temp to head writer has been told many times .
How do you remember Mike ’s arrival at BBI and his rise to power ?
A : I remember Mike as always killer funny .
As what was funniest tended to carry the day at Best Brains , Mike very quickly earned the respect of everyone there .
Q : I did a phone interview with you and Joel sometime around Season Two , and when I asked about Josh ’s departure , you kind of hemmed and hawed - and Joel interrupted you and said , “ Let me put it this way , he ’s 18 years old . ”
I think you ’ll agree that J. Elvis has matured into an incredibly talented writer and performer .
What are your memories about the circumstances of Josh Weinstein ’s departure ?
A : What I remember is that it was n’t really a referendum on Josh ’s creative talents .
I think Joel ’s statement accurately reflect my memory .
Josh was very young at the time .
Q : In some ways I ’ve always thought of you in the same way I think of Lorne Michaels at " SNL , " the guy that had to keep a firm hand on the tiller of the franchise all the while dealing with a group of very creative people .
It ’s a job that sometimes leads to becoming unpopular .
Former " SNL " cast members like Mike Myers and Harry Shearer do n’t have many kind words for Lorne , although they acknowledge that his was / is a tough job .
I wonder if you could expound a little on the unique joys and challenges of managing creative people .
A : Working on MST was rewarding and thrilling at almost every turn .
Because we were out in the woods of Minnesota , we were really left alone .
And what was paramount to this group of people was what was funniest .
So in many ways it was a very pure creative environment .
We were also a group of people who were experiencing their first TV project on a national level .
We were jazzed to be there and you could just feel that .
To be in the company of really creative and funny people was intoxicating .
Like the show itself , it was like living life with a funny narrative .
I really miss that .
Even lunches were hilarious , the topics , the takes , the jokes .
It was amazing .
However , it was always challenging wearing many hats .
I wrote , ran Gypsy , built stuff , directed , and reviewed edits .
I also dealt with the many difficult and complicated ( and sometimes heartbreaking ) issues arising from working with the networks , managing a business which for many years had a tiny budget , and doing my best to make sure everyone was pulling in the same direction .
The truth is there are legitimate issues in the production of a TV series that are divisive .
It was challenging to find myself on BOTH sides of many of these issues .
I was a writer interested in preserving the integrity of the show , and then a half - hour later I found myself taking a call from the network regarding selling the series , which the writers would perceive to be a violation of that integrity .
Those were very difficult moments .
There was a ton of investment and emotion with our staff .
People loved being there .
So when an issue came up it was always challenging to figure out the best thing to do .
In retrospect , I think we did a pretty good job negotiating this extraordinary situation , but of course we were not perfect .
Q : Just recently as part of our ongoing episode guide on the site , we covered the episode where Gypsy performed her tour de force “ Gypsy Rose ... Me ! ” Did you like the segments where it was essentially all Gypsy and she was singing or whatever ?
Or did you prefer just kind of staying to one side and saying , “ Ramchips ! ”
A : I loved what the writers did with Gypsy , evolving her from one word statements to actual performances .
If you look back to the host segments as I have done while working on the mst3 k.com site , Gypsy has a really clear , joyful sense about her .
She was a nice counterpoint to the other ‘ bots .
Q : Lately , Joel has revised , to some extent , his story about why he left the series .
Back in ‘ 93 he told fans he did n’t want to be the host anymore .
When people ask him about it now , he says he DID want to continue as host , but that you and he were fighting and that he left “ for the good of the show . ”
I wonder if you could offer your perspective on what really happened back then .
A : Making MST3K was dynamic ; that is , like the show the production environment changed over time .
My memory is that Joel got frustrated with aspects of the evolution , and he decided to preserve what he termed his “ creative ecology ” by leaving the series .
This was a huge change which involved input from all the major players : Joel , me , Trace , Kevin and eventually Mike .
Q : I take it that you were the person who dealt with the networks the most .
My sense is that it never got easier .
Can you relate some stories of dealing with the suits ?
A : In the beginning Joel and I dealt with the networks .
It was always an interesting dance , as in many cases the networks ’ needs were different from the needs of our show .
At first , CTV , as it was then known , wanted us to make a shorter version of our show .
They also wanted us to use material from different sources within each episode .
They did not believe that audiences would sit still for real - time riffing of a feature length movie .
Another network desire was that we make the show in New York .
When we balked at moving out there , they changed it to flying out on Monday and flying home on Friday .
We balked at that , too .
They finally agreed to our terms on content and production but only offered us a tiny amount of money .
Our agent , Rick Leed , got them to agree to let us keep the copyright .
I believe the network thought the show was only going to last one season anyway , so they granted the copyright to us .
Over time , as the show began to garner positive notice in the national press , the relationship with the network changed dramatically , and for the better .
When John Newton took the helm at Comedy Central , we enjoyed our best relationship .
He was a great guy full of quaint expression and loved nothing better than coming out to Eden Prairie and hang out .
When we moved to the Sci-Fi Channel we were a bona fide hit , so the relationship was respectful from the get - go .
Q : In a similar vein , can you relate some tales of dealing with the Hollywood suits while making the Movie ?
A : Making MST3K : The Movie with Universal was a real eye - opener for all of us .
We learned very quickly that the studio system tends to strain the joy out of projects , which was the opposite of how we worked .
Still , it was fun to be working in a different medium , and shooting the movie was very fun , though I could have done without the one hour of notes every night from our studio shepherd .
Q : If you could go back and do that movie experience again , knowing what you learned the first time through , what would you do differently ?
A : Hmmm , great question .
It probably would have been better to do it as an independent feature and then find a distributor who would have been excited to have the project .
The problem was we did not want to layoff staff , which would have happened if we had made it ourselves .
In the end , Universal shelved the movie after a really good first week or so .
They put the rest of the promotional dollars into the Pamela Anderson opus , " Barb Wire . "
Q : Tell us about life after MST3K .
You kind of dropped out of sight .
What have you been doing ?
A : I put everything I had into MST for 10 + years .
By the end of the series run , partly because of some very difficult issues in my personal life , I was exhausted and found that I needed to just hibernate .
During this period I explored a number of new directions , including photography and virtual reality .
About a year ago , I began to see a new direction for MST through the Internet .
Around the same time I approached Shout !
Factory to look for a new home for the series on DVD .
Q : MST3K.com has been , to use a familiar phrase , a work in progress .
I wonder if you could talk about your vision for the site , and , well , what happened to the flash cartoons ?
A : We relaunched mst3 k.com this June , and I am very pleased with the look and feel of it .
The goal is to provide a web presence for the series very much in tune with the spirit of the show .
We hope to expand the site over time to cover its history and legacy , including rare KTMA footage and photos .
I had high hopes for the Flash animation , but it turned out they were four times as expensive as I was led to believe .
We really could not afford to do them , and when that became clear I pulled the plug and we shifted the web site direction .
I am sure at some point we will put the cartoons back up on the site -- and who knows , perhaps we will make more someday .
Q : Our comment section was ablaze a few weeks ago after Joel told a convention audience that he contacted you last summer about some sort of reunion episode or episodes and that essentially you turned him down .
Would you like to offer your side of that story ?
A : Joel and I did talk late last summer about the possibility of a reunion series .
The more we talked the more it became clear that there were many hurdles to overcome .
For example , who would play Tom Servo ?
Kevin ?
Josh ?
What about Crow -- Trace or Bill ?
Or even Gypsy , for that matter .
Where would we make this ?
LA ? Minneapolis ?
Who would be in charge of the experiment ?
Would it be Dr. Forrester or Pearl ?
Who would write the episodes ?
Who would own the copyright ?
So we only got so far in our back - and - forth before I told Joel I had to focus on the pending launch of mst3 k.com .
A couple of weeks later Joel launched his new show .
Q : For the past ten years , and certainly since the series went off the air , you ’ve chosen to stay out of the public eye .
That has allowed other people to make up all sorts of rumors about you which have gone unanswered .
Is there anything you ’d like to say to set the record straight ?
A : Hmmm like what rumors ?
No , I have not become the ruler of a South American country ... yet .
I am happy that we seem to have found a nice sweet spot with mst3 k.com .
It is good to have the series on the web in that form , and I am excited about what we can do with it .
I always pay attention to the joy - compass in my life and try to follow it no matter what weird places it brings me .
Q : And now , the question every other cast member has been asked but you :
What ’s your favorite episode ?
A : Hercules Unchained !

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cuban scientists said on Tuesday the first vaccine to extend lives of lung cancer patients has been approved by Cuban authorities for use and is available in the island ’s hospitals .
The drug , CimaVax EGF , has been shown to increase survival rates on average four to five months and much longer in some patients , they said in a news conference at Cuba ’s Center of Molecular Immunology .
In contrast to chemotherapy , the traditional treatment for lung cancer , they said CimaVax EGF has few side effects because it is a modified protein that attacks only cancer cells .
They said it was the first lung cancer vaccine to be approved anywhere in the world , although there are others currently being tested .
“ It ’s the first vaccine for lung cancer registered in the world , ” said Gisela Gonzalez , who headed the development of the vaccine , begun in 1992 .
The drug is in various stages of clinical trials in a number of other countries and is most likely to be approved next in Peru , where it could be publicly available by year ’s end , Gonzalez said .
She said several private companies had been licensed to market the vaccine , but it will be produced in Cuba .
Cost for the treatment had not yet been determined , Gonzalez said .

Tania Crombet , director of clinical investigations at Havana ’s molecular immunology center , said people from outside Cuba can come to the island for treatment .
“ It ’s possible to provide this vaccine to any patient , because it ’s available in Cuba , it ’s approved by the Cuban drug agency so we can market the vaccine in Cuba and we can receive patients from outside , ” she said .
The exception would probably be Americans , she said , who are restricted from Cuba travel by the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba in place since 1962 .
“ Even though there is a new therapeutic tool approved in Cuba they probably would n’t be able to come to Cuba to receive it because of the embargo , ” Crombet said .
The drug has been approved for clinical trial in the United States , but its possible use there is at least two to three years away , Gonzalez said .
Cuba ’s state - run biotechnology sector includes around 50 research and development centers and is considered one of the most advanced in the developing world .
A photo that seems to show Chinese paramilitary forces carrying monks ’ robes provides conclusive evidence , those spreading it through e-mail claim , that the Chinese staged Tibet riots last month to justify a government crackdown .
But the photo , widely distributed via the Internet , appears likely to be a 7 - year - old image taken during a film shoot .
“ In this politically charged environment , people throw any kind of thing out there without checking , ” said Xiao Qiang , director of the China Internet Project at UC Berkeley .
“ It ’s just part of the crazy Internet world . ”
Violence broke out in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and surrounding areas March 14 - 16 , days after the start of massive demonstrations marking the anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule .
Chinese officials say 22 people died in the riots ; representatives of Tibetan exile groups say several times that number were killed .

A Chinese court Tuesday sentenced 30 people , including six Buddhist monks , to jail terms ranging from three years to life for their participation in the protests , the Associated Press reported .
Also Tuesday , the official New China News Agency reported that a policeman was shot to death Monday while attempting to capture an alleged riot leader in an ethnic Tibetan area of Qinghai , a province in the northwest .
But the Internet picture supposedly featuring the Chinese paramilitary troops and the robes did not pass the smell test , as it seemed vaguely familiar , said Ehron Asher of Denver , a blogger , musician and artist .
He has made it his mission on his blog and in Internet chat rooms to persuade people not to pass it along .
“ Yes , the Chinese government should respect human rights , ” Asher said .
“ But the Tibetan cause should not come at the cost of our own honesty . ”
The photo started making the rounds within days of the March 14 outbreak of violence .

Iris
Ho , who works for a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington , said she got it from a friend who had received it from a Tibetan .
“ I was absolutely shocked , ” she said .
“ The picture confirmed the stories we ’ve read about Chinese police dressing up as monks to incite the protesting crowd . ”
At some point the photo was attached to an article claiming that British intelligence agency spy photos “ confirmed ” that Chinese agents instigated the riots .
The Dalai Lama , the Tibetan exiled spiritual leader , echoed the charge in late March in New Delhi .
“ A few hundred soldiers have been dressed like monks , ” he said , according to local newspapers .

The photo and unsubstantiated claim soon drew skepticism from some bloggers and Indian mainstream media , although Urgen Tenzin , director of the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy , an exile group in northern India , said the Dalai Lama drew on independent sources .
“ He never based his information on that photo , ” he said .
Around this time , China ’s military PLA Daily newspaper weighed in .
The paramilitary soldiers depicted in the photo were from the Tibet Armed Police Corps and were acting as film extras , it said .
They were wearing summer uniforms that are not worn in March , it added , and the type of rickshaw awning pictured was phased out in 2004 .
The photo appears to be from the 2001 filming in Lhasa of “ The Touch , ” starring Michelle Yeoh , who said on her blog at the time that the filmmakers used 2,500 extras because they could n’t find enough genuine lamas , a situation captured by photographer Yuan Rongzhao on his blog .
Former armed police corps member Tao Yongjun , an extra in the film , said that if he and the others serving as extras had been trying to hide anything they would not have been so conspicuous in handling the monks ’ robes .

“ In short , there does n’t appear to be anything there , ” said Robert Barnett , a professor at Columbia University .
Barnett is among those who received another e-mail , though this one apparently never got much traction , containing pictures of an Asian male allegedly carrying a Tibetan fetus on a tray and eating it .
The man is identified as a staff member of the Lao La Sa Zhou Fang Chinese restaurant in Lhasa .
Given this behavior , the e-mail says , China has no moral right to host the Olympics this summer in Beijing .
“ Please pass this round the world , ” it adds .
An assistant manager at Lao La Sa Zhou Fang , who asked not to be identified given tensions in Tibet , said the restaurant had no idea why it was singled out .
“ We are running a business following both the laws and our conscience , ” the woman said .
“ We decry such rumors . ”

Performance artist Zhu
Yu said that , in fact , the photos are of him and were lifted from the brochure of his October 2000 show at the Shanghai Arts Expo titled “ Eating People . ”
Zhu said his work was misused in a 2001 hoax that claimed that eating fetuses was a Taiwanese pasttime .
“ They are rascals , ” said Zhu , busy preparing for a Beijing exhibition of his oil paintings .
“ But given the Internet , I do n’t think I am capable of stopping them by myself .
Let it be . ”

Woman kills herself over home foreclosure Associated Press
Published : Wednesday July 23 , 2008
Print This Email This TAUNTON , MA ( AP ) A 53 - year - old wife and mother fatally shot herself shortly after faxing a letter to her mortgage company saying that by the time they foreclosed on her house that day , she would be dead .
Police said that Carlene Balderrama used her husband 's high - powered rifle to kill herself Tuesday afternoon , shortly after faxing the letter at 2:30 p.m .
The mortgage company called police , who found Balderrama 's body at 3:30 p.m .
The auction was scheduled to start at 5 p.m. and interested buyers arrived at the property in Taunton , about 35 miles south of Boston , while Balderrama 's body was still inside , according to Taunton police chief Raymond O'Berg .
Police did not immediately release the name of the mortgage company .
O'Berg said Balderrama 's fax read , in part , " By the time you foreclose on my house I 'll be dead . "
O'Berg also said a suicide note found next to Balderrama told her husband , John , and 24 - year - old son to " take the ( life ) insurance money and pay for the house . "
" I had no clue , " said John Balderrama explaining that his wife handled all the couple 's finances .
" I 'm just lost .
I tell you I 'm beside myself . "
He said Carlene had been intercepting letters from the mortgage company and shredding them without his knowledge .
He had no idea she had n't paid the mortgage in 42 months .
" She put in her suicide note that it got overwhelming for her , " he told The Associated Press in a phone interview Wednesday .
" Apparently she did n't have anyone to talk to .
She did n't come to me .
I do n't know why . "
John Balderrama filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy three times from 2004 to 2006 , but the courts dismissed the petitions .
Debtors who declare bankruptcy under Chapter 13 generally can keep their homes while paying off their debts under a court - approved reorganization plan .
How Fast Can Humans Run ?
The average human walking speed is in the neighborhood of 3 mph ( 4.8 km / h ) .
How fast do you think you could run at a full sprint ?
10 mph? 15 mph ?
What speed could you average over 26.2 miles ?
Below , I have taken several men’s and women ’s world records and calculated the runners ’ average speed .
Usain Bolt has averaged over 23 miles per hour in both the 100 and 200 meter events .

McCain has a new , nasty attack ad running against Obama .
It ’s based on pure falsehoods and a fake GOP created controversy — and the sick thing is that McCain is now using wounded U.S. soldiers as political fodder .
No surprise really — except for McCain ’s media toadies who still think he ’s a stand - up guy .
McCain has the Bush / Rove crew on board and this is standard procedure for them .
McCain has got nothing to offer the American people so McCain is setting out to destroy Obama ’s reputation .
He ca n’t win — he can only make Obama lose .
The Obama campaign sent out this response :
“ John McCain is an honorable man who is running an increasingly dishonorable campaign .
Senator McCain knows full well that Senator Obama strongly supports and honors our troops , which is what makes this attack so disingenuous .
Senator Obama was honored to meet with our men and women in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan this week and has visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed numerous times .
This politicization of our soldiers is exactly what Senator Obama sought to avoid , and it ’s not worthy of Senator McCain or the ‘ civil ’ campaign he claimed he would run , ” said Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor .
Just today , the Washington Post , which cuts McCain every break possible , trashed McCain over his latest line of attack against Obama ’s patriotism :
This is not the “ politics of civility ” that Mr. McCain was promising as recently as last month .
“ What a welcome change it would be were presidential candidates in our time to treat each other and the people they seek to lead with respect and courtesy as they discussed the great issues of the day , ” Mr. McCain wrote in a letter to Mr. Obama proposing weekly town hall meetings .
With these latest comments , Mr. McCain falls short of the standards he set out .
This is n’t the McCain they thought they knew .
This is Karl Rove ’s John McCain .
Wonder what David Broder ( and all the Broder wannabes like Cillizza ) thinks of this ?
And , team Obama needs to hit back hard — really hard .
Obama has repeatedly said he wo n’t let the campaign get distracted .
His words “ Not this time ” have reinforced that message .
Now is the time to prove it .
We ’ve been saying the GOP was going to get nastier and uglier than anything we ’ve ever seen .
It ’s starting .

Comedian Lewis
Black is dismayed by the number of American landmarks that have been falling into foreign hands due to the country 's economic problems .
In a segment on Tuesday 's Daily Show , Black complained that " America 's gone from a beacon of hope to a beacon of insane deals .
It 's the End of an Empire sale -- and everything must go ! "
" We 're so hard up for cash , we 're dismantling America and selling it for scrap , " Black lamented .
" The Chrysler Building -- going once , going twice , sold .
Abu Dhabi bought the skyscraper for $ 800 million . "
As his second example , Black pointed out that " this $ 95 million oceanfront mansion once owned by Donald Trump was just bought by a Russian fertilizer mogul " -- who may tear it down to build something else .
" Wow , " Black exclaimed .
" Trump 's design esthetic is even tacky to a guy who sells shit for a living ! "
" It 's a little sad that Americans do n't come through and buy things like this , " was Trump 's own comment on the sale .
" Oh , we can buy homes like that , " Black noted .
" We just ca n't pay for them . "
Black finally bemoaned the sale of Anheuser - Bush to a Belgian brewer .
" How bad is the economy when we 're being bought out by Big Waffle ? " he wailed .

Greenland ’s ice sheet represents one of global warming ’s most disturbing threats .
The vast expanses of glaciers  massed , on average , 1.6 miles deep  contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet .
Should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean , they would flood coastal capitals , submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the world ’s atlases .
The infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the ocean ’s currents , plunging Europe into bitter winter .
Yet for the residents of the frozen island , the early stages of climate change promise more good , in at least one important sense , than bad .
A Danish protectorate since 1721 , Greenland has long sought to cut its ties with its colonizer .
But while proponents of complete independence face little opposition at home or in Copenhagen , they have n’t been able to overcome one crucial calculation : the country depends on Danish assistance for more than 40 percent of its gross domestic product .
“ The independence wish has always been there , ” says Aleqa Hammond , Greenland ’s minister for finance and foreign affairs .
“ The reason we have never realized it is because of the economics . ”
Climate change has the power to unsettle boundaries and shake up geopolitics , usually for the worse .
In June , the tiny South Pacific nation of Kiribati announced that rising sea levels were making its lands uninhabitable and asked for help in evacuating its population .
Bangladesh , low - lying , crowded and desperately impoverished , is watching the waves as well ; a one - yard rise would flood a seventh of its territory .
But while most of the world sees only peril in the island ’s meltwater , Greenland ’s independence movement has explicitly tied its fortunes to the warming of the globe .
The island ’s ice cover has already begun to disappear .
“ Changes in the ocean eat the ice sheet from underneath , ” says Sarah Das , a glaciologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts .
“ Warmer water causes the glaciers to calve and melt back more quickly . ”
Hunters who use the frozen surface of the winter ocean for hunting and travel have found themselves idle when the ice fails to form .
The whales , seals and birds they hunt have begun to shift their migratory patterns .
“ The traditional culture will be hard hit , ” says Jesper Madsen , director of the department of Arctic environment at the University of Aarhus in Denmark .
“ But from an overall perspective , it will have a positive effect . ”
Greenland ’s fishermen are applauding the return of warm - water cod .
Shops in the island ’s capital have suddenly begun to offer locally produced potatoes and broccoli  crops unimaginable a few years earlier .
More women detained at an ICE - contracted center in Georgia say they were pressured into gynecological surgery that may have been unnecessary
The Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla , Ga. , drew national attention this month after a nurse , Dawn Wooten , filed a whistle - blower complaint claiming that detainees had told her they had had their uteruses removed without their full understanding or consent .
Since then , both ICE and the hospital in Irwin County have released data that show that two full hysterectomies have been performed on women detained at Irwin in the past three years .
But firsthand accounts are now emerging from detainees , including Ms. Dowe , who underwent other invasive gynecological procedures that they did not fully understand and , in some cases , may not have been medically necessary .
… The Times interviewed 16 women who were concerned about the gynecological care they received while at the center , and conducted a detailed review of the medical files of seven women who were able to obtain their records .
All 16 were treated by Dr. Mahendra Amin , who practices gynecology in the nearby town of Douglas and has been described by ICE officials as the detention center ’s “ primary gynecologist . ”
The cases were reviewed by five gynecologists — four of them board - certified and all with medical school affiliations — who found that Dr. Amin consistently overstated the size or risks associated with cysts or masses attached to his patients ’ reproductive organs .
Small or benign cysts do not typically call for surgical intervention , where large or otherwise troubling ones sometimes do , the experts said .
The doctors stressed that in some cases the medical files might not have been complete and that additional information could potentially shift their analyses .
But they noted that Dr. Amin seemed to consistently recommend surgical intervention , even when it did not seem medically necessary at the time and nonsurgical treatment options were available .
In almost every woman ’s chart , Dr. Amin listed symptoms such as heavy bleeding with clots and chronic pelvic pain , which could justify surgery .
But some of the women said they never experienced or reported those symptoms to him .

I 've always been fascinated by stack - oriented languages because of their simplicity and elegance .
Instructions take input off of the stack , do something with it , and push the output back onto the stack .
Thus , there are no named variables or arguments , and the order of execution is left - to - right without any need for parentheses to denote precedence .
As a result , it does n't take long for people to learn the basics of programming in a stack language .
Another appeal of stack languages is that it is relatively easy to create reasonably efficient implementations for them , especially where memory considerations are at a premium .
Because of this , we find stack languages in multicore processors ( SeaForth , www.dspdesignline.com/188701424), virtual machines ( Java Virtual Machine language ) , and embedded devices .
In general , when we think of stack languages , we often think of imperative languages : Each instruction does something to a shared stack .
An alternative and equally accurate view of stack languages is that each instruction is a function that takes a stack as input and returns a stack as output .
This is the principle upon which Manfred von Thun based the Joy language ( www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/phimvt/joy.html).
The language that Joy most closely resembles is PostScript in that explicit control structures ( branches , gotos , jumps ) are replaced with higher order instructions ( instructions that execute other instructions ) .
Joy , however , introduced explicit function literals ( PostScript uses a delayed execution operator ) and eliminated the concept of the definition dictionary ; in other words , you can't dynamically define or redefine new operations .
This yielded a new breed of stack language that shares the advantages of pure functional languages ( for example , it is expressive and easy to reason about and manipulate formally ) .
It is interesting to note that despite its similarities to other stack - based languages , Joy evolved independently from Schoenfinkel and Curry 's combinatory logic and the FP language by John Backus ( www.vector.org.uk/archive/v203/vonthun203.htm).
My interest in Joy was primarily motivated by my search for an intermediate language that could be easily targeted by imperative and functional languages , could be easily optimized , and could be statically verified .
Joy relies heavily on dynamic checking , so I created a more restricted , statically typed language based on Joy and called it " Cat . "
Introducing Cat
In the Cat specification , instructions are referred to as " functions , " regardless of whether they have side effects .
New functions are defined using the define keyword , and have global scope .
Functions cannot be redefined , and are only visible after they are defined .
Example 1 presents some simple examples .
define myFirstCatProgram { " what is your name ? " writeln readln " Hello " swap strcat writeln } define addone : ( int -> int ) { 1 + } define swapd : ( ' a 'b 'c -> 'b ' a ' c ) { [ swap ] dip } define dupd : ( ' a 'b -> ' a ' a ' b ) { [ dup ] dip } define bury : ( ' a 'b 'c -> 'c ' a 'b ) { swap swapd } define fib // compute fibonnacci { dup 1 <= [ dup dec fib swap fib + ] [ ] if } define fact // compute factorial { dup <= 1 [ dup dec fact *] [ pop 1 ] if }
At the core of the Cat language are primitive instructions for :
Mathematical operations : add , mul , sub , div , mod , rem , inc , dec .
Logical operations : and , or , not , xor .
Function construction : c ompose , papply , quote .
Executing functions : apply , dip , if , while .
Manipulating the stack : swap , dup , pop .
Dealing with lists : list , cons , uncons , head , tail , count , nth .
Comparing values : eq , lt , gt , lteq , gteq , neq .
In Cat , a literal ( for example , 42 , 'q ' , " Hello Christopher
" , 3.14 ) pushes a value onto the stack .
Additionally , you can also write literal functions , by enclosing an expression in square braces ( [ 1 + ] ) .
This has the effect of pushing a function onto the stack without executing it .
In Joy parlance , this is called a " quotation , " but I think of it as an anonymous function .
Anonymous functions are first class values :
They can be constructed dynamically and treated like any other primitive value ( you can dup them , swap them , pop them , and so on ) .
You can execute anonymous functions using higher order functions such as apply , if , and while .
Closures ( functions bound to values in the local environment ) can be constructed in Cat using the papply primitive instruction .
This has the effect of binding the top value on the stack to the function , a process known as " partial application " ( partial application is frequently mislabeled as " currying " ) .
An example of partial application is that if you wrote 1 [ < = ] papply , it has the same effect as if you wrote [ 1 < = ] .
The quicksort algorithm in Example 2 is a more sophisticated example of Cat .
The algorithm relies on a binary recursion instruction ( bin_rec ) that provides a general implementation of a binary recursive process ( also called " tree recursion " ) .
Example 3 is a possible definition of bin_rec .
define qsort : ( list -> list ) {{ desc :
This is a simple implementation of a quick - sort algorithm .
test : in : [ 5 4 2 1 3 2 4 ] list qsort out : [ 5 4 4 3 2 2 1 ] list }} { //
Does list have 0 or 1 elements ? [ small ] //
Base case do nothing [ ]
// Argument - relation //
Split the list using the head as a pivot // storing the pivot under for later use [ uncons under [ lt ] papply split ] //
Append the pivot to the first list // then concatenate the two lists .
[ [ swap cons ] dip cat ] bin_rec }
define binrec ( input , cond , term , unfold , fold ) { input cond [ term ] // termination transformation [ input unfold // split input [ cond term unfold fold binrec ] // self call with same arguments ap p2 // call function twice : // once with second value removed // once with top value removed ] if }
The bin_rec function is an example of a hylomorphism ( see citeseer.ist.psu.edu/meijer91functional.html ) the composition of an anamorphism ( an unfolding function ) and a catamorphism ( a folding function ) .
Hylomorphisms are interesting because they can be used to eliminate the construction of intermediate data structures ( citeseer.ist.psu.edu/launchbury95warm.html ) .
The quicksort algorithm in Example 2 also demonstrates an extended feature of Cat called " metadata " a form of structured comment that can associate additional data with a Cat function that can be used by tools .
For example , metadata can be used to document functions and perform automatic unit tests .
The format is based on YAML ( Yet Another Markup Language ) and uses significant whitespace to denote hierarchical structure .
To demonstrate how compact Cat can be , Example 4 includes an implementation of the Google MapReduce algorithm ( labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html ) .
The general idea of the Google MapReduce algorithm is to define a task in terms of subtasks that can be executed ( in this example , counting instances of words ) , and a function to combine the results of the subtasks ( called the " reduce function " ) .
While my implementations of Cat do not execute MapReduce concurrently , you can easily develop an implementation of Cat that automatically executes map and self_join to take advantage of available parallelism in the executing environment .
This leads to an important point about Cat :
As an implementor , you decide how to implement the primitive instructions and whether to implement standard library functions as library functions or built - in functions .
This opens lots of opportunities for high - performance implementations .
Protesters say rural dwellers are missing out on India 's growth
The march
Some 25,000 protesters converged on Delhi on Sunday demanding land reform and ownership rights laws .
They had been on a march lasting nearly four weeks .
The protesters say they have been left behind by India 's economic boom .
But they now say that their protest has been a success .
' Clear the hurdles '
" Our demands have been met .
We are fully satisfied , now that the rural development minister came here and made the announcement , " a protest leader , Bharat Bhushan Thakur said .
" These measures will clear the hurdles in giving land to poor people .
We are now ready to go back , " the AFP news agency quoted him as saying .
The marchers were prevented from reaching parliament
According to the protesters , the government has agreed that half the seats on the new panel will go to the landless and indigenous .
A government statement said the panel would examine " all land - related issues " .
The BBC's Renu Agal in Delhi says that no timetable has been set to for the government to meet the protesters ' demands .
Rural Development Minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said that action would be taken as soon as possible .
The protesters are mainly low - caste tenant farmers and landless indigenous people .
Earlier on Monday they were prevented by police from marching to the parliament building .
They then staged a sit - down protest at a large , dusty carnival ground in the heart of Delhi .
For the past month , they have marched across India , hoping to take their protest to the government .
The protesters waved flags and chanted " give us land , give us water " , as they marched in long , orderly lines into the centre of the capital .
Their demands included a national authority to oversee land reform and a system of fast track courts to deal with the long delays in resolving land disputes .

Col Gaddafi was conciliatory up until his comments about candidate Obama Libya 's leader has strongly criticised US presidential candidate Barack Obama for saying Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel .
Col Muammar Gaddafi said he was either ignorant of the Middle East conflict or lying to boost his campaign .
Mr Obama was speaking to pro-Israel lobbyists in the US last week .
Referring to him as " our Kenyan brother " , Col Gaddafi also said Mr Obama might suffer from an inferiority complex because of his African origins .
The issue of race could make Mr Obama 's behaviour " more white than white people " , Col Gaddafi suggested , rather than acting in solidarity with African and Arab nations .
The comments came during a speech to mark the 38th anniversary since the US evacuated Wheelus Air Force base in Tripoli .
Israel claims Jerusalem as its " eternal , undivided " capital , but the Palestinians want the eastern half - occupied by Israel in 1967 - as the capital of a future Palestinian state .
The Americans left Libya shortly after Col Gaddafi came into power in a bloodless coup in 1969 .
' Campaign lie '
The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli says the speech was a passionate critique of past US policies towards Libya but emphasised that current relations are not confrontational .
We tell him to be proud of himself as a black and feel that all Africa is behind him
Col Gaddafi
History of US - Libya ties However , Col Gaddafi 's defiant and famously politically incorrect rhetoric returned when talking about Mr Obama towards the end of the speech .
" The statements of our Kenyan brother of American nationality Obama on Jerusalem ... show that he either ignores international politics and did not study the Middle East conflict or that it is a campaign lie , " he said .
" We fear that Obama will feel that , because he is black with an inferiority complex , this will make him behave worse than the whites . "
" This will be a tragedy , " Gaddafi said .
" We tell him to be proud of himself as a black and feel that all Africa is behind him . "
Conspiracy theory Mr Obama 's epic primary campaign against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ended in his victory early this month .
The presidential election will be in November .
Correspondents say he has largely avoided playing on past racial struggles in the US and has drawn support among black and white Americans .
In addition , Mr Gaddafi suggested Mr Obama 's comments may have been informed by a fear of assassination by Israeli agents , " the same fate as [ former US President John F ] Kennedy when he promised to look into Israel 's nuclear programme " .
Conspiracy theories abound about Kennedy 's assassination in 1963 .
An inquiry led by the chief justice of the US Supreme Court found that the shooting was carried out by a lone gunman , Lee Harvey Oswald .

Up to 150 people are feared dead after a plane packed with holidaymakers overshot the runway at Barajas airport in Madrid today .
Spanish emergency services said only 25 of the 172 passengers and crew on board the Spanair flight survived when it crashed after swerving off the runway at terminal four .
The crash happened at 2.45 pm local time ( 1545 BST ) when the jet , which was heading for Las Palmas , in Gran Canaria , attempted to take off .
Witnesses said one of the engines caught fire as the aircraft was leaving the runway .
It took to the air momentarily before veering to the right and crashing into the ground between two runways , breaking into two parts .
Reports suggested that the plane had come down on its second attempt to take off .
A civil guard returning from the scene told El País newspaper : " It does n't look anything like a plane - it 's horrific .
Everything is burnt .
It 's the closest to hell that I 've seen . "
A member of the emergency services described the area as a " war zone . "
Manuel Moleno , a Spanish journalist who was near the area when the accident happened , told the BBC the plane had " crashed into pieces " .
" We heard a big crash , " he said .
" So we stopped , and we saw a lot of smoke . "
There were conflicting reports of the death toll , with the Spanish interior ministry saying that more than 100 people had been confirmed dead so far .
Another 19 were said to be in a critical condition , with 25 having suffered less severe injuries .
Two babies were thought to be on board .
Spanair , which is owned by the Scandanavian carrier SAS , had a code - sharing arrangement with the Lufthansa flight LH255 .
Seven passengers on board the plane were confirmed as Lufthansa passengers , four from Germany .
Spanish radio reported that Swedes and Danes were also believed to have been among the passengers .
The Foreign Office said two British officials were at the airport to find out whether any Britons had been on board .
Hundreds of emergency workers and dozens of ambulances and firefigting vehicles were sent to the scene , along with heavy lifting equipment .
Helicopters and fire trucks dumped water on the plane , which ended up in a wooded area at the end of the terminal four runway .
Thick columns of white smoke billowed from the scene .
The airport was closed for a number of hours , with passengers being turned away .
Some services are now understood to have resumed .
Reporters at the scene said the terminal building had filled up with people either looking for information about relatives on the flight or caught up in the travel disruption .
Unconfirmed reports said the flight had been due to take off at 1 pm and had left the departure gate at 1.05 pm , returning just over half an hour later because of technical problems .
A Spanair spokesman said it was too early to confirm why the plane , which was 15 years old and was last serviced in January , had crashed .
He said the company 's thoughts were with those who had been injured and the relatives of those who had died .
" Spanair regrets to confirm that its flight number JK 5022 , from Madrid to Las Palmas de Gran Canarias , was involved in an incident at Madrid today , " the spokesman said .
" On board were 164 passengers and nine crew members .
JK is a code share flight with Lufthansa LH 2554 .
" Spanair is doing everything possible to assist the Spanish authorities at this difficult time , and has established a local helpline number for relatives or friends of those who may have been on board . "
An official with the Madrid emergency rescue service said crews were removing the dead and injured from the wreckage .
" It is certain catastrophe , " he added .
The US national transportation safety board said it was sending an investigation team to Madrid to help with the crash investigation because the aircraft is American - made .
Spanish media reported that the plane 's black boxes had already been found .
The Spanish prime minister , José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , broke off his holiday to return to Madrid .
Officials said a makeshift morgue was being set up at the city 's main convention centre .
Terminal four at Barajas was designed by the British architect Richard Rogers and opened in 2006 .
It serves many European and long - haul flights and is a stopover for thousands of passengers travelling within Spain and to South America .
Around 60 million passengers use the airport , which is around 10 miles north - east of central Madrid .
An emergency telephone number , +34 800 400 200 , has been set up for relatives of people on the flight .
Spanish radio said it was being inundated by calls from people complaining that the number was permanently engaged .

Increasing numbers of violent women are stretching police resources , a police association has warned .
About 240 women a day are arrested for violent crime in England and Wales , according to recent figures .
Police in Scotland and Northern Ireland say , anecdotally , they have also seen an increase in female violence .
The chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales , Paul McKeever , said there was a " new phenomenon " of women using violence and joining gangs .
Mr McKeever said : " Clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday life and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country . "
Young women were also forming all - female gangs or becoming part of " violent robbery gangs " , he said .
" It 's a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service . "
Targets blamed According to recent figures from the Ministry of Justice , 240 women a day were arrested for violent offences in England and Wales in 2006 / 07 .
Traditionally young women have been much more informally socially controlled than young men , and we may be seeing some changes
Professor Susan Batchelor
And figures released in May by the Youth Justice Board said the number of crimes committed by girls aged 10 to 17 in England and Wales had gone up by 25 % in three years to 59,000 - with significant increases in minor assaults , robberies , public order offences and criminal damage .
Men and boys are still far more likely to be involved in violent crime , however .
Crime reduction charities agree there is an increase in female violence .
But they say that often police deal with violent women formally to meet their targets .
The chief executive of crime charity Nacro , Paul Cavadino , said crimes by girls such as fights in and around school would have been dealt with by more informal methods a few years ago .
But now they are " more often dealt with by more formal methods like reprimands , final warnings and prosecution " .
Professor Susan Batchelor , of the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research , said violence carried out by young women was " newsworthy " specifically because it was quite unusual .
" Young women are seen as the future of the population and we have much more concerns about their behaviour , " she said .
" Traditionally young women have been much more informally socially controlled than young men , and we may be seeing some changes . "
This is denied by police forces , who say they target violent behaviour whoever is committing it .

What are these ?
I feel an infantile delight when I see shiny lights and pretty colors .
I sometimes find myself following police cars and ambulances for miles and I have been known to walk into any Spencer 's Gifts I come across , lured in by strobe lights , plasma spheres , and the promise of saucy greeting cards for my 40th birthday .
That love for flashing lights might explain my abiding love for laser light shows .
There is nothing quite so patriotic as spending the evening of a muggy July 4th listening to Lee Greenwood belt out all the hits sure to turn your blood red as green lasers recreate an American flag on the side of a mountain .
It 's a rare treat , as American as Budweiser or the pain of stepping barefoot on a discarded sparkler , but why limit yourself to just once a year ?
Laser light shows are available for party and event rentals !
Once I decided that I needed to hire a laser light show I tracked a company down on the Internet and made an inquiry posing as Sam Samsson .
From : Sam Samsson
To : Laser Light Amusements
Re : I NEED A LASER
DEAR SIRS ,
I NEED A LASER SHOW FOR AN EVENT .
THIS IS A MAJOR EVENT AND I NEED THE BEST AND MOST POWERFUL LASERS AVAILABLE .
PLEASE CONTACT ME WITH DETAILS .
SAM SAMSSON
14/88
Imagine my great pleasure when someone named " Rudy " emailed me back within hours interested in discussing the details .
Rudy turned out to have an AIM account and was very eager to discuss my event .
My formative email prank became an IM prank .
SS_HH : HELLO ARE YOU RUDY FROM THE LASER COMPANY ?
Rudy : Yeah , are you Sam ?
SS_HH : THATS ME
Rudy :
What can I do for you Sam ?
SS_HH : YEAH , WANTED TO HIRE SOME LASERS FROM YOUR COMPANY FOR AN EVENT .
I EMAILED YOU .
I'M SAM SAMSSON .
Rudy : Okay , well we have a number of options as I mentioned in my email .
What sort of venue will you be holding your event at ?
SS_HH : A BUILDING
Rudy : I mean , square footage , type of structure , that sort of thing .
SS_HH : LARGE BARN A LOT OF SQUARE FEET LIKE 25 FEET WIDE AND 100 FEET LONG
Rudy : Okay , that is fine .
We need full electrical access .
Is the barn wired ?
SS_HH : YES TOM CAN BRING GENERATORS FROM HIS SURVIVAL BUNKER TOO
Rudy :
That 's perfect .
What sort of attendance are you expecting ?
SS_HH : LAST YEAR 9 PEOPLE CAME BUT BILL ERTYL DIED FROM EMPHAZEEMA
Rudy : I 'm sorry to hear that , but are you sure nine people is worth hiring a light show ?
SS_HH : DONT GIVE ME A HARD RUB SON
SS_HH : YOU THINK WE AINT GOT THE MONEY FOR YOUR FANCY LASERS ?
WE GOT MONEY
Rudy : I did n't mean anything by that .
That 's fine .
We would rent to just one person if they wanted us .
SS_HH : THATS GOOD , BUT THIS YEAR WILL BE WAY BIGGER ANYWAY .
DAN TANNER AND HIS WIFE JOINED AND THERE BRINGING THEY'RE DAUGHTER TO SING ACAPELLA SKREWDRIVER COVERS MIGHT BE LIKE 12-14
Rudy :
That 's great .
So what is the budget we 're looking at for the program ?
SS_HH : I AINT TELLING YOU HOW MUCH MONEY I GOT JUST SO YOU CAN TAKE IT ALL
Rudy :
It 's good to have a starting point .
SS_HH : YOUR STARTING POINT IS KISS MY WHITE KEISTER I AINT SEEN YOUR PICTURE I DONT KNOW WHAT SORT OF NOSE YOU GOT .
Rudy : I do n't follow
SS_HH : I BET YOU DONT WHY DONT YOU JUST TELL ME WHAT LASERS YOU GOT AND ILL TELL YOU WHAT I NEED
Rudy :
We have three packages .
Rudy :
We have the basic package , which is the basic equipment rental and you handle setup and operation .
We have the deluxe package , which is the same gear to rent , but we handle setup and give you an operator for the night .
OUr best package is Premium , which is great if you need a custom show .
We have our full range of lasers and we handle everything , including custom programming .
SS_HH : HOW MUCH IS THE PREMIUM
Rudy : 9,000 for the equipment rental , 10,000 for deposit , 250 for each custom graphic and 750 for each custom animation
SS_HH : WHEW
SS_HH : CRAP HOW MUCH FOR BASIC ?!!!!??
Rudy : 2,000 for the rental , 5,000 for the deposit
SS_HH : YOU TAKE REPRODUCTION MILITARIA AS TRADE ?
Rudy : No. Cash , credit card , or check and we need a valid CC for deposit
SS_HH : AND I GOTTA WORK IT ALL MYSELF ?

I 'm not one for violence , but damn it , the citizens of " any " country need to take the first shot .
I realize many may not have guns and this should warn Americans to not give theirs up .
If the police are n't going to serve the citizens , then the citizens have GOT to fire the first shot .
I hope it does n't , but if this does happen here the US , my brothers better march the streets with guns and not pans .
It 's obvious protesting and pans do n't work too well as evil only knows violence .
Fight fire with coal .

Part 2 - 9:02
What happenned in Argentina ?
How was it possible that in so rich a country
so many people were hungry ?
The country had been ransacked by a new form of aggression ,
committed in time of peace and in a Democracy .
A daily and silent violence that caused greater social disruption ,
more emigration and death ,
than the terrorism of the dictatorship and the Falklands Islands War .
The Never - Ending - Debt
Ever Since Independence , almost 200 years ago ,
Argentina 's foreign debt has been a source of impoverishment and corruption
and the biggest scandals .
Since the first loan negotiated by Rivadavia in 1824
with the British bank Baring Brothers ,
the debt was used to enrich Argentinean financiers ,
to control the finances and empty the country of its wealth .
This Foreign debt always went hand in hand with big business ,
and with the complicity of nearly every government ,
from Miter and Quintana , to Menem and De La Rua .
The policy of indebtedness gave rise in Argentina
to generations pf technocrats and bureaucrats ,
who favored banks and International Corporations
over their own country .
Educated at Harvard , Chicago , Oxford or Buenos Aires ,
their portraits hang in the official galleries .
There you can see 19th century lobbyists ,
like Manual Garcia and Belaustegui ,
or the latest heads of the public baniking system ,
Pedro Pou , Macaronne and Colombo ,
administrators of a debt that born in the 1970s
under the military dictatorship .
1976
" We have turned the page of government interventionism ... "
The present debt was the illegitimate offspring
of the military dictatorship .
Even though the Courts demonstrated its fraudulent origins ,
the pressure of the Establishment Won the day .
From then on , it dictated national policies
and depleted the public heritage .
All this is perfectly symbo;ized by the
statue of George Canning , an advocate of colonial policies ,
that was donated by the British Government in 1857 ,
in recognition of the debt .
1973
American defeat in Vietnam
Conservatives return to power
Crisis and rising oil prices
Petrodollars flood the world
Bankd offer credit at 3 %
Birth of the Third - world Debt
1981
Interest rates reach 16 %
Bankruptcy of indebted countries
An Alliance of Foreign Banks and Multinationals
comes to power in Argentina .
After 7 years of neo-liberal policies ,
the dictatorship leaves a country bled dry ,
with a foreign debt of 45 BILLION dollars ,
of which half is a private debt .
23 Billion is owed by multinationals operating in the country
like Citibank , First Boston , Chase Manhattan ,
Bank of America , Banco de Italia , Banco de Londres , Banco Espanol ,
Banco Frances , Deutsche Bank , Banco Rio and Banco Quilmes ,
Banco Galicia and many maor .
and by Multinationals like Esso , Fiat , IBM , Ford ,
Mercedes Benz , Swift , Pirelli ,
as well as local groups owned by Perez Companc ,
Bulgheroni-Bridas , Macri , Techint , Fortabat , Pescarmona ,
Gruneisen , Soldati , Cogasco , Celuosa and others .
An excessive private debt
that a top bureaucrat of the dictatorship saddled the State with :
Domingo Cavallo .
A " super - Minister " of Finance in the Menem and De La Rua Governments ,
he is responsible of the unending growth of the debt ,
and the worst pillage ever suffered by the Argentine people .
THIEVES , BANKERS , GOVERNMENTs - Give us BACK our Dollars
What did you say ?
" The police protects the thieves , Mr Solanas . "
The World 's turned upside - down .
Now the prople must demonstrate peacefully
to defend their savings , that were CONFISCATED by the banks
with Government Complicity .
The State should guarantee citizens ' rights , - Not STEAL them . "
" THIEVES "
" A Dollar at a time , I saved during the 25 years I worked ,
so I could live decently when I retired ,
not on a State Pension .
Why do n't the banks treat us like
their Foreign Customers ?
I chose Private Banks , I did n't trust ours .
I already got swindled in 1989 .
But I must be stupid .
What do they want ?
A Bomb ?
That 's not my style , That 's why I 'm banging on my pan .
I used to cook with it for my kids .
Every time I look at it , I 'll be
reminded of those scoundrels , but I 'll know I fought for my rights . "
" I'm the oldest newsvendor in Avellaneda ,
for 65 years I 've sold newspapers , all my savings are in Citibank .
The manager of the agency says they 'll return them to me ,
It 's a LIE !
Everything I saved by making sacrifices is in their hands . "
" In faCT , THE FOREIGN banks owe money to the Argentineans .
In a way , it 's reversed debt .
The parent companies must be responsible for the deposits .
That was decided by law in Argentina in 1971 ,
in the well - known Swift Deltec case , which
established that companies were responsible
for the debts of their subsidiaries .
It 's a swindle to make government responsible
for the debts of the Banks . "

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
" Make no mistake about it , " U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich. , said Monday while chairing a meeting of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations .
" Excessive speculation in commodity markets is having a devastating effect at the gas pump that is rippling through our entire economy . "
Here 's a suggestion :
The next time a Congressional committee wants to hold a hearing on how " speculators " are driving up oil prices , each committee member should first be required to demonstrate - preferably in their opening remarks - a basic understanding of the mechanics of futures trading .
Even better , they should be required to explain in detail how it is that investors who never take delivery of a single barrel of crude - and thus never remove a drop of oil from the open market - are causing record high oil prices .
If there were such a requirement , I guarantee we'd never again see a circus like the one Stupak presided over Monday .
" Do I think [ Washington politicans ] understand the role of futures markets - how they facilitate price discovery and the transference of risk ? " asks former U.S. Commodities Futures Trade Commission chief economist Gerald Gay .
" No , they 're clueless - at least most of them . "
Bad public policy
If our representatives did understand the oil markets , they'd know that the true telltale sign of a speculative bubble is not rising trading volumes but rising oil inventories .
Speculators would be hoarding oil - building up inventories either in anticipation of higher prices or as part of a scheme to drive prices there .
Yet according to the Department of Energy , U.S. oil inventories are now at below - average levels .
U.S. oil stocks stand at 309 million barrels , versus 330 million in June 2005 .
So far , lawmakers have introduced nine different bills targeting oil speculators , though for the most part their prescriptions have been milder than their over - the - top rhetoric .
Bashing futures traders may well be good politics , but it 's stupid public policy .
By providing a mechanism for locking in prices , the futures market makes it easier for oil companies to make costly investments in new production - which is the key to lowering prices at the pump .
Futures trading also discourages hoarding in an otherwise tight market .
Without speculators willing to take the other side of so many futures contracts , oil refiners and other end - users might be inclined to ramp up their spot - market purchases and store more oil as a hedge against further price increases .
And , of course , any increased draw on current supplies would lead to even higher oil and gasoline prices .
Indeed , without a futures market , I believe we'd be decrying oil at $ 200 a barrel oil instead of oil at $ 135 .
A more basic misconception in Washington involves what these so - called speculators are really buying .
They 're not buying oil , they 're buying futures , and this is a crucial distinction .
A futures contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller to deliver a set amount of oil - typically 1,000 barrels - at a specific price on a specific date .
The value of that contract rises and falls , depending upon market conditions , right up until the date of delivery .
Thing is , the pension funds , index funds , hedge funds and other so - called speculators almost never take delivery of any oil .
The typical investment fund will buy , say , the August oil future and then sell it days before it comes due - typically rolling over the proceeds into the next month 's contract .
" For speculators to be propping up the price of oil , they somehow have to be taking physical oil off the market , " says energy markets expert Craig Pirrong , a finance professor at the University of Houston 's Bauer College of Business .
Pirrong points out that when the federal government decided to bolster cheese prices in the 1970s , it did so by purchasing warehouses full of cheese and keeping it off the market .
" Well , where 's the cheese now ? " Pirrong asks .
" Where 's all the oil that the speculators have held off the market ? "
Even if you believe there 's no way that oil trading volumes could be soaring without influencing oil prices , remember that influence then has to run two ways .
If an index fund is indirectly driving up spot oil prices every time it buys a future , then the converse must be true , too - there must be an equal and opposite downward push on spot prices every time that future is sold .
In other words , futures market critics can't have it both ways .
There 's something else politicians conveniently overlook : futures trading requires two to tango .
For every investor who is betting oil prices will go up , there also needs to be an investor willing to take the opposite side of that bet .
In the past , there have been times when the overwhelming majority of speculators were " longs " betting on higher prices , while their commercial - trader counterparts - i.e. traders working for oil refiners , airlines , and other end - users of oil - were the " shorts " betting prices would fall .
But as New York Mercantile Exchange Chairman James Newsome explained to Stupak 's Congressional committee , today 's speculators are evenly split between shorts and longs .
Moreover , the percentage of futures contracts held by speculators ( as opposed to commercial traders ) " actually decreased over the last year , " Newsome told the subcommittee , " even at the same time that [ oil ] prices were increasing . "
It 's time to find a new scapegoat .
My own nominee : Congress .

( CNN ) -- Sujit Bhattacharya knew he felt sluggish and had trouble putting on his socks and shoes .
One day , when he tried on a pair of size 30 shorts , his wife pointed out that they fit only under his belly .
Sujit Bhattacharya says losing weight has improved his frame of mind .
He is shown in 2006 , left , and 2007 .
more photos »
Yet Bhattacharya , of Coppell , Texas , never paid attention to his weight problem until his doctor told him he had high cholesterol in summer 2006 .
His friends also told him that he had become heavy and needed to do something about it .
The feedback was upsetting , he acknowledged , but the combination of his friends ' prodding and the cholesterol numbers motivated him to start trimming down his 193 - pound frame .
" I needed some tough love : things I did n't want to hear but needed to hear , " Bhattacharya said .
He researched how to lose weight extensively on the Internet , including CNN. com 's health section .
He learned that 3,500 calories add up to one pound of weight and tried to figure out how to eat to decrease his daily caloric intake .
Instead of eating a few large meals every day , he ate six small meals , keeping track of how many calories he consumed .
He had been eating more than 2,500 calories a day , perhaps 3,000 , so he cut this down to 1,500 calories a day .
That meant losing a pound every two or three days .
LOW - CALORIE DAY
Here 's an example of a typical day in Sujit Bhattacharya 's diet :
Morning : glass of low - fat milk with Nestle Quik ( 150 calories )
Exercise : Lemonade and Gatorade afterward ( 50 calories )
Late morning : snack of a piece of fruit ( 75 calories )
Lunch : lean piece of chicken with two vegetables and rice ( 500 calories )
Late - afternoon : snack of Healthy Choice fudge bars ( 90 calories )
Dinner : spaghetti with a meatball or two ( 500 calories )
Night : bowl of cereal like Froot Loops ( 150 to 200 calories )
TOTAL : 1,515 to 1,565 calories
" As long as you know how many calories you need and how many calories you eat , it 's just math , " he said .
He also included more fruits and vegetables in his diet and ate fewer fatty meats .
For exercise , he changed his routine from three days a week of limited cardio and heavy weights to six days a week with the same heavy weights but increased cardio .
In six months , he lost 40 pounds .
Since then , he 's put on about 5 pounds of " good " or muscle weight but has otherwise sustained his new physique through diet and exercise .
Today , at age 39 , he said he 's starting to look more like when he was in high school .
Losing weight has improved Bhattacharya 's overall frame of mind , he said .
He also noticed that he does n't get colds or the flu and fights off infections faster than before .
iReport.com : Share your success stories
Sometimes Bhattacharya wonders why he did n't start losing weight earlier and can say only that he felt " fat , dumb and happy . "
" I did n't understand what I was doing was hurting me , " he said .
He actively encourages friends to try his weight loss method .
One friend lost 20 pounds following his advice .

" What I tell friends is : You 've got to have a burning platform , something to make you start , a goal or desire , " he said .
" For me , it was the bad cholesterol test and friends .
Someone else may want to fit into a bikini in the summer . "
Dietitians say they would encourage others to follow Bhattacharya 's example of reducing calories and spreading them more throughout the day instead of eating big meals .
If you try it , make sure you have enough energy , feel good while doing it and eat foods you enjoy so you can stick to it long - term , said Dawn Jackson Blatner , a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association .
In fact , Bhattacharya did twice as well as the average person in a weight loss program , Blatner said .
He lost 20 percent of his body weight in six months , beating the national average of 10 percent .
Tara Gidus , ADA spokeswoman and team dietitian for the NBA 's Orlando Magic , recommends that women never eat fewer than 1,200 calories and men no fewer than 1,500 calories per day .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Fitness and nutrition
She typically does not recommend cutting out 1,000 calories at a time , " but if someone is really motivated to lose weight and they eat snacks that are filling in between meals , then they can cut a significant number of calories , lose weight and not feel overly hungry , " she said .
Blatner said she would also encourage anyone who wants a drastic diet change to consult a doctor .
Bhattacharya emphasizes that anyone can shed unwanted pounds as long as he or she compares the number of calories needed to maintain weight and the number of calories he or she eats .
" I firmly believe it is not hard to lose weight , " he said .
All About Weight Loss
Citizens First is a survey of Canadians about the government services they receive .
The goal of the survey is to better understand how to deliver services to citizen that puts them first .
This year ’s survey is soon to be released .
Here is a peak at the top eight highlights that were provided a recent e-bulletin from the Institute for Citizen - Centred Service :
1 . Five drivers reveal the secrets of citizen satisfaction with service
Why are some people satisfied with the service they get , while others are not ?
Five drivers of satisfaction are primarily responsible .
• Timeliness , ( the single most important driver across all services , all governments )
• Staff ( Critical dimensions are knowledgeable staff who treat customers fairly and “ go the extra mile ” , make that extra effort )
• Positive outcome : “ I got what I needed ”
• Ease of access
• Citizens ’ recent experiences with services .
2 . The problems of the telephone – the “ citizens channel ” – continue to need focus
The telephone remains the most commonly used channel in government services .
Still , satisfaction ratings for the telephone are lower than for other major channels such as government offices and the Internet .
Part of the explanation is that citizens experience more access problems on the phone than in other major channels .
Busy lines , difficulty finding the right number , trouble with automated phone systems , difficulty understanding the person at the other end , and waiting on hold all contribute to frustration .
3 . The Internet has “ come of age ”
One of the most interesting findings of Citizens First 5 is the “ coming of age ” of Internet use .
The initial Citizens First study in 1998 did not ask one question about Internet use – government services were barely visible online .
Today , Internet use is practically on a par with visits to government offices and telephone use .
Surprisingly , however , the Internet is not displacing traditional channels .
Citizens see the Internet as a complement to , rather than as a replacement for , other channels .
4. Citizens increasingly use multiple channels to access government
Multi-channel access to services continues to increase .
In CF5 , 59 percent of respondents used more than one government channel to address their needs .
This is a significant jump from the 50 percent who reported using multiple channels in CF3 in 2002 .
5 . For routine services , citizens say …
Since 1998 , citizens say that timeliness for routine services in government offices , on the telephone , and in electronic communications is their number one priority .
• Citizens ’ expectations in certain areas remain stable :
• 2 people is the maximum number that citizens want to deal with , either in a government office or on the telephone .
• 5 - 9 minutes is the maximum length of any queue .
• 30 seconds is the acceptable time to wait on hold on the phone before you speak to a person .
• The same day is when citizens expect a reply to a voice mail or email , if the message is left by 10:00 am .
One area has shown a steady and dramatic shift over time : citizens now expect a much faster turnaround of mail services – their expectation is just one to two weeks from the time they mail in a request until they receive the response .
6 . Persons with disabilities require services to meet their needs and lead to positive outcomes
In CF5 , 7 % of respondents reported they had a visual , auditory , motor or other disability that made it difficult for them to access government services .
Persons with disabilities rate the broad spectrum of government services lower than do persons without disabilities .
The difference in ratings averages 4 or 5 points out of 100 .
A major reason is that persons with disabilities less often get a positive outcome – one of the key drivers of citizens ’ satisfaction .
7. Service quality ratings rise over 10 years of tracking
Each of the five Citizens First studies has tracked citizens ’ ratings of a basket of municipal , provincial / territorial and federal services .
Averaging across all services , there has been a significant upward trend .
The average score for the 26 services that have appeared in all studies of Citizens First has risen from 64 in 1998 to 72 in 2008 – an 8 point increase .
37 services are trending up , 31 show no statistically significant change , and 2 have declined .
Of those that did not change , 15 have appeared in just the last two studies of Citizens First , so the time frame is relatively short .
8. Roots of confidence in government and the public service are uncovered
Confidence in government is , in fact , rooted both in good service and in confidence in the public service .
Confidence in the public service , in turn , rests on competent management and the perception that the public service is fair , honest , and in touch with the community .

If you have n't had the opportunity to work on a behemoth application that requires more full - time production support developers than most companies employ , then you 've missed out on a lot of fun .
In these systems , trying to find quality code is like trying to find a needle in a stack of hay other needles ... while blindfolded ... with your feet .
Now as much as I 'd like to feature such an application , I suspect that most readers would stop reading after the eightieth page or so .
Instead , I 'll present a single line of code representative of the entire system Kico Zaninetti came to maintain ...

And no , this was not taken out of context .
And yes , it really was that bad .
I 'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to try to imagine what possibly could be surrounding this code .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I ’ve refrained from writing about the Georgia crisis until now , because although I have had an interest in Russia , and had been sensing a growing wariness about Russia among the rarified field of foreign policy experts , I did not have an immediate sense of what was going on in that conflict .
Although it was clear that Russia was increasingly attempting to dominate it ’s near - abroad , the timing of the conflict seemed to indicate that it was Georgian President Saakashvili who had most to gain .
In my discussions with others about the matter , there seems to be a great deal of confusion – and narratives and counter - narratives driven by propaganda have dominated these discussions .
So , as a preliminary step , and for backwards refences , I am constructing here a timeline of events and a list of the players .
The Players
Georgia has been part of various Russian empires since the 1800s .
After Communists took over in 1917 , Georgia declared independence .
By 1921 , the Soviet Union had attacked and subjugated it again .
As the Soviet Union began to crumble in 1989 , Georgia again began to push for independence .
This led to the massacre of Georgian citizens by the Soviet army at an unauthorized but peaceful demonstration .
By 1991 , Georgia was again independent .
But ethnic tensions soon led to two civil wars taking place – with Russians supporting the forces that opposed the central Georgian government in both places .
One of the civil wars took place in Abkhazia , where Russian supported the minority Abhkaz who sought to ethnically cleanse their part of the country .
A 1989 census reveals that just under half of the country ’s population was ethnically Georgian ( 239,872 ) and under 20 % was Abkhaz ( 93,267 ) .
Fourteen years later , The Abkhaz made up over 40 % of the population with only a small rise in total population ( 94,606 ) while ethnic Georgians now accounted for just over 20 % of the population ( 45,952 ) .
The Georgian population in Abkazia decreased by almost 200,000 over this time .
Of course , these statistics do not tell the entire story .
The Abkhaz minority had opposed the Georgian attempt to achieve indedependence from Russia and both sides had used ethnicly directed violence in the civil war in the early 1990s .
See the Human Rights Watch report on the conflict .
( PDF ) .
Russian peacekeepers have been deployed in Abkhazia since the end of the violence .
The other Georgian civil war took place in South Ossetia .
South Ossetia has been considered part of Georgia for some time – and was incorporated into the Russian empire as part of Georgia in 1801 , and was part of Georgia when it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1917 and 1991 .
However , in both instances , the South Ossetians opposed breaking from the Soviet Union – and took up arms with the support of the Russians against the central Georgian government .
The Soviet Union ’s most prominent leader , Josef Stalin , was , in fact , from the country of Georgia , and an ethnic Ossetian .
When Georgia declared independence , the South Ossetians opposed this and boycotted elections .
After Georgia established it ’s independence , a civil war broke out with some 25,000 ethnic Georgians fleeing the region with ethnic violence being used by both sides .
By 1992 , a peacekeeping force led by the Russians , but including both Ossetians and Georgians was able to enforce a peace agreement .
There was relative peace in South Ossetia until 2004 when tensions began to mount .
The Russians had continued to build up their peacekeeping force in the region , and had been supplying the South Ossetian army with large caches of weapons .
They had allowed free reign to various criminal gangs operating out of South Ossetia ( including one that attempted to sell nuclear materials to a joint US / Georgian sting operation . )
Russia considered the American alliance with Georgia ( as well as American alliances with Estonia , Latvia , Lithuiania , Ukraine , Poland , Kazakhstan , and other former Soviet colonies ) to be a regional challenge to Russian dominance .
When America and Europe recognized the independence of Kosovo ( a part of Serbia , a traditional ally of Russia ) , Putin declared that he would begin to push for independence for the two disputed regions in Georgia .
Russia – with it ’s peacekeepers in each region and supply of arms to local militias and militaries – already exercised de facto control over these regions .
Moreover , inundated with a mountain of cash from it ’s sale of oil and natural gas , Russia has begun to act more assertively in international affairs .
America saw the small democracy of Georgia as a natural ally .
America supplied arms and training to the Georgia military .
Since the Rose Revolution of 2003 in which the current president , Mikheil Saakashvili , took power , America has grown closer to Georgia and recently pushed it ’s membership in NATO .
Aside from it ’s democracy , Georgia is also seen as useful from the American perspective because it can be used as a counter to increasing Russian influence in the region .
A Timeline
From 2004 to 2008 , tensions between Russia and Georgia mount .
The Ukranian Orange Revolution and the Georgian Rose Revolution , both of which involved attempts to steal elections by the more pro-Russian force being turned back by peaceful and mass demonstrations of the public , take place .
Russia is not happy .
The Russian government accused the Georgians of supporting rebel Chechens in the Second Chechen war , though the evidence is inconclusive .
Russia also opposed Saakashvili ’s efforts to crack down on seperatism in Georgia .
Shortly after taking power in the Rose Revolution , Saakashvili began to pressure the autocratic leader of the independent region of Adjara to resign and allow the central government a greater role in the region .
Under great pressure from internal demonstrations and international pressure , Adjara ’s leader resigned and fled to Moscow before he was indicted on various charges of embezzlement , misuse of office , and murder .
Adjara maintains it ’s autonomous status , but is becoming further integrated into the Georgian polity .
Russia had sided with Adjara ’s leader during the conflict and had wanted to maintain a military base in the region .
So this further escalated tensions .
Russia is not happy .
Georgia began a military build - up in the regions outside of Abhkaz and South Ossetia .
Russia continues to increase it ’s peacekeeping force and to arm those opposed to the central Georgian government .
Neither side is happy .
Georgia pushed for and America supported Georgia ’s bid to become a member of NATO , a military alliance originally created to oppose the Soviet Union .
Russia is not happy .
Russia ’s power and wealth is increasing as it has become Europe ’s main source of natural gas and a major exporter of oil .
Russia is happy and more powerful .
August 8 , 2007 : Georgia claimed that a Russian jet violated it ’s airspace and fired a missile , which did not explode .
American and European countries urged both countries to ratchet down the rhetoric .
In March 2008 , things began to escalate .
America recognized Kosovo as an independent nation .
Kosovo was part of Serbia , a traditional Russian ally , and the Russian opposed the independence of Kosovo .
Russia threatened to take steps to escalate the situation in South Ossetia and Abhkazia .
Later in March , Russia took diplomatic steps to further the process of recognizing these two regions as independent states .
In April 2008 , the Georgian government accused the Russians of shooting down an unmanned drone in Georgian airspace .
Russia denied this .
A United Nations report later backs up the Georgian version of events .
The rhetoric escalates on both sides as they both accuse the other of attempting to escalate the conflict .
May 2008 sees Russia inceasing it ’s peacekeeping force in Abhkazia .
Seperatists in Abhkazia claim to have shot down Georgian drones operating over Abhkazia .
Georgia denied having any drones operating there .
( The Georgians are probably lying about this . )
In July 2008 , Russian fighter jets flew over South Ossetia , into Georgian airspace .
Moscow claimed it violated Georgia ’s territory in order to “ cool heads ” in Georgia ’s capitol .
Georgia withdrew it ’s ambassador to Moscow in protest .
Meanwhile , mixed messages are being sent .
The United States continued to express strong support of Georgia and Saakashvili in public and to caution him in private to avoid taking any steps to escalate the situation .
At the same time , Russia ’s peacekeepers are allowing various criminal gangs to operate out of South Ossetia , and periodic attacks by Ossetian seperatists into Georgia are overlooked .
August 1 , 2008 : Fighting between Georgian and South Ossetian forces breaks out .
Georgia accuses the South Ossetians of shelling nearby Georgian villages .
The seperatists deny this .
August 5 , 2008 : As ethnic South Ossetians begin to evacuate into Russia , the Russian ambassador declares that Russia will defend South Ossetia against Georgia .
August 7 , 2008 : Georgian President Saakashvili orders a ceasefire , but fighting still intensifies .
Later in the day , in a televised address , he orders Georgian forces to remove what he calls the “ criminal regime ” in South Ossetia .
August 8 , 2008 : Russian troops storm South Ossetia with massive force pushing back the Georgians , and launching attacks deep into Georgia to entirely destroy it ’s military infrastructure .
Russia claims that Georgia had killed thousands of Ossetians in an effort to ethnically cleanse the region .
Human Righs
Watch is unable to find any evidence of this , finding only 45 civilian deaths in South Ossetia .
However , they find massive evidence of ethnically motivated attacks on ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and widespread looting by seperatists .
August 9 , 2008 : Russian - backed seperatists in Abkhazia launch an attack on the region still controlled by ethnic Georgians who wish to remain part of Georgia .
August 10 , 2008 : The Russians move SS - 21 medium - range ballistic missile launchers into South Ossetia , weapons which could potentially be nuclear .
August 11 , 2008 : Russians deploy paratroopers in Abhkazia to raid Georgia proper .
August 13 , 2008 : Georgia withdraws all of it ’s forces from the disputed territories .
Despite a ceasefire order by the Kremlin , Russian forces occupy the country ’s main highway and attacks the city of Gori , splitting the nation in two .
Human Rights
Watch issues a report documenting the burning and looting of ethnic Georgian villages as well as the restraint of the Georgian army in South Ossetia .
August 15 , 2008 : Human Rights
Watch reports that Russia used cluster bombs on the civilian population of Georgia .
August 16 , 2008 : Russians occupy the Georgian port city of Poti and several other strategic positions within the nation and advance within 34 miles of the Georgian capitol of Tblisi .
The Associated Press reports that ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia have been drafted as forced laborers under guard by Russian and South Ossetian troops .
August 17 , 2008 : The Russian President Medvedev announces that Russian troops will begin to pull out of the undisputed territory of Georgia on Monday .
Edit : August 18 , 2008 : In a report meant to sum up the human rights violations in this conflict to date , Human Rights Watch reports that the Georgians ’ used “ indiscriminate force during their assault on Tskhinvali and neighboring villages on August 7 - 8 , [ caused ] numerous civilian casualties and extensive destruction . ”
The report mainly describes :
Russian military ’s use of indiscriminate force and its seemingly targeted attacks on civilians , including on a civilian convoy .
The deliberate use of force against civilians or civilian objects is a war crime .
Human Rights
Watch has also confirmed the Russian military ’s use of cluster bombs in two towns in Georgia .
Ian Traynor of Britain ’s The Guardian and Michael Dobbs in the Washington Post each had insightful columns this weekend analyzing the conflict with clarity .
Dobbs summarizes the war :
Saakashvili ’s decision to gamble everything on a lightning grab for Tskhinvali brings to mind the comment of the 19th - century French statesman Talleyrand : “ It was worse than a crime , it was a mistake . ”
Michael Walzer in the liberal Dissent magazine also has a good piece .
But the single most important insight came in a column by this blog ’s nemesis , Paul Krugman , last Friday :
By itself , as I said , the war in Georgia is n’t that big a deal economically .
But it does mark the end of the Pax Americana — the era in which the United States more or less maintained a monopoly on the use of military force .
And that raises some real questions about the future of globalization .

Updated The North Carolina Republican
Party is planning to roll out a television advertisement on Monday attacking a pair of Democrats running for governor in the state for endorsing Senator Barack Obama by playing a clip of his former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , excoriating the United States .
The release of the commercial , which Republican officials said would debut during 6 p.m. newscasts in the state on Monday , injects a potentially divisive racial element into the state ’s upcoming Democratic presidential primary on May 6 .
( Our colleague Elisabeth Bumiller , reporting from the campaign trail , tells us that Senator John McCain denounced the ad this morning .
He also just issued a letter urging the head of the state G.O.P. not to broadcast the ad .
See Mr. McCain ’s comments and text of the letter below . )
The advertisement features a narrator intoning , “ For 20 years , Barack Obama sat in his pew , listening to his pastor . ”
Then the advertisement cues up the clip that has become infamous at this point of Mr. Wright , who was Mr. Obama ’s pastor at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago , preaching in 2003 and using an expletive when referring to the United States .
The Wright video excerpt , which played on an endless loop on television and the Internet last month , sparked a firestorm of controversy and eventually prompted Mr. Obama to deliver a major address on the issue of race relations .
Mr. Wright was talking in his sermon about the country ’s treatment of African - Americans and arguing , instead of singing “ God bless America , ” they should sing something else .
The North Carolina G.O.P.’s commercial says Bev Perdue , the lieutenant governor , and Richard Moore , the state treasurer — both of whom are seeking the Democratic nomination in North Carolina for governor — and have endorsed Mr. Obama should “ know better . ”
“ He ’s too extreme for North Carolina , ” the narrator says .
Brent Woodcox , the state party ’s communications director , said officials have not yet decided the size of the advertising buy and how long the commercial will run on television .
The advertisement also features a request for donations to the party to keep the commercial on the air .
Update : From Ms. Bumiller , who is covering Mr. McCain ’s campaign events through rural Kentucky : “ There ’s no place for that kind of campaigning , the American people do n’t want it , period , ” Mr. McCain told reporters on his bus this morning .
He said he had not seen the ad and hoped that he would n’t , but that he had been given a description of it .
“ I understand that it moves numbers , negative ads do all that , but that does n’t mean it ’s right , ” Mr. McCain said .
Mike Duncan , the chairman of the Republican National Committee who was traveling with Mr. McCain , said that he had left a message with Linda Daves , the chairwoman of the North Carolina Republican party , also asking that the ad not be used .
Mr. McCain ’s campaign released a letter he wrote today to Ms. Daves :
From the beginning of this election , I have been committed to running a respectful campaign based upon an honest debate about the great issues confronting America today .
I expect all state parties to do so as well .
The television advertisement you are planning to air degrades our civics and distracts us from the very real differences we have with the Democrats .
In the strongest terms , I implore you to not run this advertisement .
This ad does not live up to the very high standards we should hold ourselves to in this campaign .
We need to run a campaign that is worthy of the people we seek to serve .
There is no doubt that we will draw sharp contrasts with the Democrats on fundamental issues critical to the future course of our country .
But we need not engage in political tactics that only seek to divide the American people .
Once again , it is imperative that you withdraw this offensive advertisement .
Afternoon update : Despite the requests from Mr. McCain and the R.N.C. , Mr. Wilcox reiterated the party ’s plans to broadcast the commercial .
Bringing an end to the Samsung slush fund probe , a South Korean court has fined Lee Kun - hee , Samsung 's former Chairman and son of the chaebol 's founder , $ 109 million for tax evasion .
A rather favorable decision when you consider that prosecutors sought a seven - year jail sentence and a fine of $ 347 million .
The court said that his crimes did not justify a prison term .
Lee , appearing relieved by the decision , apologized again saying , " I 'm sorry for causing trouble to the people , " presumably while adjusting his monocle and top - hat from atop his golden chariot .
It 's probably not as painful as having his arm chopped off in Darren Aronofsky 's Requiem for a Dream , but it 's still going to hurt .
Because Virgin Records wants an arm and a leg from actor Jared Leto and his band 30 Seconds to Mars , for failure to deliver a new record on time .
That 's a seriously hefty parking ticket .
According to the Associated Press , Virgin sued Leto and crew on Friday for what can only be described as a cheeky number .
$ 30 million from 30 Seconds ?
Classy .
The details of the band 's tardiness have yet to be explained , but its past performance so far has been above - average for a major - label rock band with a movie star at the helm .
Sure , its 2002 self - titled debut only sold 100,000 copies , but it 's 2005 effort A Beautiful Lie went platinum , and the band was nominated for the usual MTV awards given to paparazzi rock .
After playing a steady stream of dates in 2007 , 30 Seconds to Mars has reportedly been at work on the new effort , but evidently it 's not moving fast enough for Virgin .
Maybe it should book some time on Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic to speed things up ?
Probably wo n't make a difference : 30 Seconds to Mars is likely another casualty in the massive cost - saving merger with Capitol Records executed by EMI , whose major restructuring in 2007 was aimed at saving hundreds of millions a year .
Looks like we know where they 're going to get $ 30 million of it .

Barack Obama Moves to the Center
As anyone who 's paying attention knows , Barack Obama does not support gay marriage .
He 's also been relatively muted in his opposition to a proposed constitutional amendment in California that would end marriage equality there .
Yet there they were at Seattle 's Gay Pride Parade on June 29 , marching down Fourth Avenue under a blazingly hot sun— scores of gay voters sweating as they held aloft iconic Obama placards that had been retooled in rainbow colors for Pride .
Their implicit promise :
We will vote for you no matter which way you move on our issues , because you 're better than the alternative .
It 's a promise that Obama is counting on receiving from constituent groups across the Democratic spectrum as he dashes , post - nomination - fight and pre-convention , toward the safe political center .
And quite a dash it 's been .
In the last few weeks , Obama has upset huge swaths of the liberal base in rapid - fire fashion .
When the U.S. Supreme Court banned executing child rapists , Obama announced that he disagreed with the court 's decision — reminding everyone that he supports the death penalty , and making clear that he wants it to be handed out to people who rape children even though it has traditionally been reserved only for murderers .
" I have said repeatedly that I think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes , " Obama told reporters , trying to walk a fine line but mainly , as far as death penalty opponents on the left were concerned , highlighting a huge point of disagreement between him and them .
( For example , Liliana Segura , a writer for the liberal online publication AlterNet , heatedly described Obama 's move as " a reactionary political calculation . " )
The next day , the Supreme Court struck down a handgun ban in Washington , D.C. , giving gun-rights advocates a historic victory and providing Obama an occasion to remind Americans that he supports gun rights .
With liberal gun-control advocates smarting from the sweeping ruling , Obama cast the court 's decision as being in sync with a view he 'd long held .
" I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms , " Obama said .
He added some lines about supporting the efforts of " crime - ravaged communities " to stem the scourge of gun violence , but his intent was clearly to distance himself from the kind of gun-control measures the court had struck down — despite that fact that his own campaign had once said he supported those very measures .
All of this came on top of the fact that Obama had just reversed himself on another issue important to parts of the liberal base , the renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
In the past , Obama had said he would oppose the FISA bill because it grants immunity from prosecution to the telecom companies that aided President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
Now Obama says the bill is " not all that I would want , " but that it 's good enough and necessary to protect Americans .
This reversal has been particularly resonant among the online liberal " netroots . "
On MyBarackObama.com , a group calling on Obama to " Please Vote NO on Telecom Immunity " and " Get FISA Right " quickly became one of the larger groups on the site .
The question is whether Obama cares .
Paul Krugman , writing in the New York Times about these and other disappointments , wondered if Obama would end up letting down the ideological left in a manner similar to the last Democratic president , the center - grabbing Bill Clinton .
" Progressive activists , in particular , overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama during the Democratic primary even though his policy positions , particularly on health care , were often to the right of his rivals ' , " Krugman wrote .
" In effect , they convinced themselves that he was a transformational figure behind a centrist facade .
They may have had it backward . "
This sense was given even more support when , two days after Krugman 's column , Obama announced that he not only supports Bush 's controversial Office of Faith - Based and Community Initiatives , but wants to expand its programs in his own administration — and then , to defend himself from charges of fuzzing up the boundary between church and state , Obama provided reporters a supportive quote from a man who once headed the office .
Under Bush .
That seemed to answer the question of whether Obama cares .
He has made his calculation .
He believes the liberal base , after eight years of chafing under Bush and presented with his historic candidacy and a great shot at winning the White House , will , like those marchers at the Seattle Pride Parade , gleefully throw themselves under his bus .
He 's probably right .

I recently wrote an article called Bob Barr : Libertarian Saul of Tarsus .
It was an attempt to try to understand why certain libertarians look to his record before his conversion as condemnation of his post - conversion campaign .
Basically I wondered if Saul of Tarsus ( St. Paul ) was greeted the same way by the early Christians .
One of the comments I received mentioned that “ On every single issue , Bob Barr is stretching libertarianism towards conservatism and statism . ” , “ With Bob Barr , the Libertarian party is losing its radicalism .. ” and “ .. there is no case today that Bob Barr is a mainstream Libertarian . ” .
Now , this is n't the first time since Bob Barr 's nomination that I 've heard these comment or comments similar in nature .
Do these people feel that Bob Barr is n't a Libertarian or is n't Libertarian enough .
Who is defining what is a Libertarian .
If I am to use the comments above , a “ mainstream Libertarian ” is apparently a radical .
I do not believe this to be true .
My 100/100 on the Nolan Chart does not make me a radical , but I also would not call myself “ mainstream ” .
The term mainstream is usually synonymous with “ middle - of - the - road ” , or average , not on either extreme .
On the Nolan Chart an average of 80 would be dead center , which would make between 70 and 90 apparently mainstream .
By the calculation of the RLC , Bob Barr 's life time average on the Nolan Chart is 76 , that is pretty close to the center of the “ mainstream ” .
I think I just made a case for Bob Barr being a mainstream Libertarian .
As for the Libertarian Party losing it 's radicalism , maybe it is n't the Party losing its radicalism but the radicals losing control the Party .
I , for one , think it 's a good thing .
One of the reasons I joined the LP was because it seems so all inclusive .
Maybe it was just Harry Browne 's calm demeanor that made it feel that way .
It appears to me that the radicals in the LP are just as closed and narrow - minded as the Republicans and the Democrats .
You 're either 100 % pure Libertarian or your a Statist !
The LP radicals love to throw that word around , like the Democrats use “ racist ” and the Republicans use “ liberals ” .
Again , I would never consider Bob Barr to be a radical Libertarian , but his congressional record and his current stance on issues puts him in the Libertarian camp and in the mainstream of Libertarianism .
The two arguments against Bob Barr is either his congressional record , which I have pointed out , was overall libertarian , or his current positions , which are even more libertarian .
Returning to a sensible national defense policy , reducing the size and scope of government , repealing the 16th amendment , maximizing individual liberty and restoring the Constitution all seem to be very mainstream Libertarian positions .
It just leads me to believe that the radicals just do n't think he 's libertarian enough for their “ pure blood ” .
I think that rather than Barr stretching libertarianism towards conservatism , he is stretching conservatism towards libertarianism and bringing more people under the Libertarian umbrella .
As for Bob Barr needing to give a long detailed interview in which he goes over all aspects of his conversion to his “ skeptics ” ( read : Elitist , Purists , Radicals ) is unnecessary .
In fact the use of “ conversion ” ( which I am also to blame for using ) may be a misnomer .
Conversion usually means change from one thing to another .
If Bob Barr 's congressional record was libertarian , and he has since become more libertarian , it would be more of an evolution than a conversion .
I think when looking at his past in that light , his explanations of his transgressions and the current work he is doing is a sufficient explanation .
I think the radicals have run the Party long enough .
We are on the five yard line with 95 yards to go , we can't just keep throwing the ball to the end zone .
Sure it 's our ultimate goal , but when you 're backed up this far , you need to give yourself some breathing room before you start airing it out .
Run the ball .
Give the ball to someone who can get you a first down .
Then some short drop passes , move the ball down field .
Build the momentum .
We might not get the touchdown on this possession , but a field goal would be nice right now .
Hell , I 'll settle for that initial first down .
I think Bob Barr can do that .
I think he can get us that first down and more .
In a recent Zogby poll he is at 6 % nationwide .
The troubling statistic in that poll was that only 43 % of libertarians support Bob Barr .
I wish the other 57 % can see the logic in supporting an evolving libertarian who has put together successful federal campaigns and has the media contacts to get the LP back into the game .
I 'm tired of our Party being referred to as “ Loosertarians ” .
You can keep your small “ l ” principles and still support the Libertarian Party .
I do .
As I have said before , it is relentless incrementalism that got us here and we need a more pragmatic game plan .
Throwing “ Hail Mary ” passes for four downs might give us hope , but it is highly unlikely to achieve our goal .
I urge all liberty - minded people to vote for Bob Barr .
He may not be Libertarian enough for some people , but he is a Libertarian and he is helping our cause in the the correct direction ; towards limited government and maximum individual liberty .

The Iraq War ! Remember ?
Remember when it started , and it was kind of big deal that some journalists were embedded with the troops ?
Well , this is great .
As it turns out , it was more of an exchange program .
Because they actually also had troops embedded with the journalists !
Glenn Greenwald :
As I noted on Sunday , the most striking part of the roughly - 7000 - word article was that several of the most guilty news outlets -- CBS , NBC and Fox -- just outright refused to answer the NYT 's questions about their use of military analysts , what they knew about their analysts ' dealings with the Pentagon and the defense industry , and what procedures they use ( then and now ) to ensure that they do n't broadcast government propaganda disguised as independent analysis .
Identically , other news organizations not explicitly mentioned by the NYT article but which used some of the tainted sources ( such as The Washington Post ) have similarly failed to address their role in disseminating this Pentagon - controlled propaganda .
Media organizations simply ignore -- collectively blackout -- any stories that expose major corruption in their news reporting , as evidenced by the fact that no major network or cable news programs have ever meaningfully examined the fundamental failures of the media in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
As Bill Moyers noted at the beginning of his truly superb documentary on the media - government collaboration concerning the invasion : " The story of how the media bought what the White House was selling has not been told in depth on television . "
Thus , one of the most significant political stories of this generation -- what Moyers described as " our press largely surrender [ ing ] its independence and skepticism to join with our Government in marching to war " -- has simply been rendered invisible by our largest media outlets .
That scandal just does not exist , particularly on television .

Male teachers are rare in U.S. elementary schools
Most children go through elementary school under the charge of few if any male teachers , and local educators do n’t like it .
Historically , the number of female schoolteachers has overshadowed the number of male schoolteachers .
In fact , the numbers are n’t even close .
The National Education Association says the population of male teachers nationwide has been shrinking for decades .
Roughly 21 percent of the country ’s 3 million teachers are male , according to a 2004 NEA report .
The difference in elementary schools is even more striking : Only 9 percent of elementary school teachers are male .
Those figures are in line with what Mark T. Brophy , staffing mentor coordinator for Worcester public schools , has seen .
In Worcester , 778 women and 72 men , or about 8.5 percent , work at the elementary level , Mr. Brophy said .
In the Wachusett Regional School District , 177 women work in elementary schools , compared with 18 men , or about 9.2 percent , according to Susan H. Sullivan , director of human resources for the district .
The state Department of Education , which previously did n’t keep track of teachers by gender , began collecting those numbers this year and will report them in January , said DOE spokesman J.C. Considine .
In Worcester , Mr. Brophy has spent 22 years in public education , beginning as a kindergarten and second - grade teacher and later moving to the school system ’s human relations department .
Achieving gender balance in teaching staff is important , he said , because children do n’t go to school just for academics — it ’s where they develop social skills , too .
“ Being able to see not just one gender in the classroom ... I think it contributes to the healthfulness of a classroom , ” he said .
“ It shows that communication works in various ways , and that the world is full of males and females , and we interact with each other . ”
Kevin J. Brennan of Brookfield , a former chef who became a schoolteacher in Worcester last year , said many of his male students are excited to finally have a male teacher .
“ A lot of these kids have never had a male teacher all the way through school , ” said Mr. Brennan , who teaches sixth grade at Union Hill School .
“ It ’s wonderful to finally have a male teacher and talk about football and other male things .
“ A lot of the boys need a positive role model in their lives .
I see that more in some of the economically challenged areas , ” he said .
Anne T. Wass , president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association , said it ’s important for young children to have positive role models , both male and female .
“ I think it ’s really important for boys to have positive male role models , as well as for the girls to see positive male role models , ” she said .
Educators can’t pinpoint why so few men become teachers , but they agree that stereotypes are a big part of it .
“ Historically , we do n’t have any models of men as teachers , ” said Patrick J O’Connor , associate professor of secondary education at Worcester State College .
“ It ’s looked at as a feminized profession .
And the students have grown up in a culture where they have n’t seen many teachers that are men . ”
Bryan G. Nelson of Minneapolis , a former teacher turned male - teacher activist , puts it simply : “ Young men think they do n’t belong there . ”
Mr. Nelson is the founder of menteach.org .
He has conducted research in the hopes of deciphering the male teacher shortage , and has come up with three reasons .
They are , in no particular order :
- Stereotypes ;
- Fear of accusation of abuse ;
- Low status and low pay .
“ People assume that teaching is for women , not for men , that men are not nurturing , ” he said .
Some people assume male teachers are gay , just because they chose to become teachers , he added .
Sometimes misconceptions are serious .
Mr. Nelson said many men are wary of becoming teachers because their interactions with children are easily misinterpreted or misconstrued .
“ They have to think twice whether they hug a child or not .
People hold you under suspicion , ” he said .
“ Women teachers do n’t hesitate to show warmth to a child . ”
Mr. Nelson does n’t like the argument that men do n’t go into teaching because they need higher salaries to support their families .
He contends that single mothers become teachers , even though they have to raise children on their own .
Plus , plenty of men choose to pursue other professions — jobs such as police officers or the military , for example — that do n’t pay much more than a teacher ’s salary .
Mr. O’Connor said salary is an issue , but it ’s not just an issue for men .
Many talented young men and women who could be teachers instead are choosing jobs that pay more .
The number of undergraduate students enrolling in the secondary education program at Worcester State College has dropped at least 40 percent in the last four or five years , he said .
The starting salary for public school teachers in Worcester is $ 38,838 , according to Mr. Brophy .
Mr. Brophy said he loved the years he spent working as a teacher , but he was not free from “ false perceptions . ”
“ Yeah , there were misconceptions of me , ” he said .
“ Like , ‘ Why do you want to go work in a preschool ?’...
We ’re perceived as , if we ’re giving a kid a hug , there is something wrong with us .
“ That ’s sad that people have those misconceptions .
That ’s sad and untrue , ” he said .
“ Men can be just as caring as women . ”
There are efforts nationwide to recruit schoolteachers , but few programs specifically target men .
The Cambridge - based Schott Foundation for Public Education recently announced that it will use a $ 1 million grant from the Deutsche Bank Americas Foundation to fund an initiative to recruit and retain African - American male teachers .
Clemson University already has in place a program known as Call Me MISTER , which aims to recruit black male teachers .
There ’s no reason men can’t make good teachers , said Mr. O’Connor , the Worcester State professor .
“ There are men poets , ” he said .
“ If men can feel free enough to identify with poetry and art , it ’s funny that they do n’t feel free to go into elementary school teaching . ”

It seems like everywhere you go , people are talking complaining about the cost of gasoline .
From the natural food coop to Twitter , everyone is wondering how many hours they will have to work to fill up their gas tank .
There is one person who remains clueless as to what Americans are paying at the pump : John McCain .
In February , President Bush made headlines for his ignorance that gasoline could reach $ 4 - a - gallon .
When asked about this possibility by a reporter , Bush responded ,
Wait , what did you just say ?
You ’re predicting $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline ?
That ’s interesting .
I had n’t heard that .
. . .
I know it ’s high now .
In fact , when Bush made this remark , gas had already exceeded $ 4 - a - gallon in parts of California .
This out - of - touch remark by Bush should have been a lesson for presidential hopeful John McCain , but it was n’t .
In a recent interview with Martin Wisckol of the Orange County Register , McCain was asked when the last time he pumped his own gas and how much did it cost ?
His reply :
McCAIN : Oh , I do n’t remember .
Now there ’s Secret Service protection .
But I ’ve done it for many , many years .
I do n’t recall and frankly , I do n’t see how it matters .
I ’ve had hundreds and hundreds of town hall meetings , many as short a time ago as yesterday .
I communicate with the people and they communicate with me very effectively .
In Oregon and New Jersey , citizens are not allowed to pump their own gas , but I bet they know its cost !
To be that out of touch with an issue that is hitting Americans of low and middle socioeconomic status hard demonstrates McCain cannot represent and address the issues that concern most Americans .
In fact , I find it insulting to state , “ I do n’t recall and frankly , I do n’t see how it matters , ” when many Americans are faced with decisions about buying food or gasoline to get to work .
In trying to smooth over his faux pas , McCain ended the interview by saying :
McCAIN : Thank you .
It ’s a pleasure … .
Hang on just one second .
I think the last time that I … I ’ve been on the campaign trail for so long I do n’t remember when I last filled up my own gas tank , but I certainly did for many , many , many years and I understand the difficulties and challenges that it poses for the people of California and my home state of Arizona .
I thank you , my friend .
Somehow I doubt he really understands .
As Bill Visnic wrote on Edmunds AutoObserver , “ The cost of a gallon of gasoline is the seminal economic and political issue of the moment – yet the Republican presidential nominee can’t hazard a guess ? ”
Seriously , John McCain can’t look out his limo window as he passes a gas station and notice the price ?
The rest of America is noticing , why is n’t McCain ?

William Munns and his reconstruction of Gigantopithecus .
The famed recreator of Gigantopithecus , artist Bill Munns has opened a new window into his world and what we find inside is filled with wonders to behold .
Bigfoot .
Mokele - Mbembe .
Saber - toothed Cats .
A cryptozoo , indeed .
Munns has shared with me his news that he has uploaded and opened his Bill Munns Creature Gallery .
His continuingly upgraded site , Bill Munns Creature Gallery , represents 35 years of his work in varied fields of movie makeup effects , museum exhibit models , theme park robotics , and paleontology studies that have also included visualizations of prehistoric wildlife .
As he points out , most recently , Munns ’ knowledge of fabricating creature suits has been “ applied to the analysis of the classic cryptozoological mystery seen in the famous 1967 Patterson Film , and the debate of whether the figure in that film is a real Bigfoot or a human in a fabricated fur suit . ”
Munns also spends some time exploring an issue that directly impacts on another area of some import to cryptozoology – the possible existence of what he entitles , The Sauropod ’s Trunk .
In an innovative and thoughtful bit of lateral reconceptualizing , Munns takes the past reconstructions of some dinosaurs and rethinks them .
He notes his “ hypothesis is born out of the unusual position of the nares ( nostril openings in the skulls ) of the sauropods .
In the Diplodocids , the opening is at the top of the skull , between the eyes , and the opening is flush with the skull ’s surface in a non-descript fashion .
In the Brachiosaurids , the opening is enormous , has a high arching delicate bone in the center along the medial line , and there is a massive concavity or recessed hollow in front of the openings and directly above the teeth .
As different as they both are , they have one fundamental thing in common .
In both cases , the nares are at the top of the skull instead of the normal pattern of being located at the front of the skull .
“ In the matter of comparative anatomy with existent species , no existent skulls are identical , but two types do have nares at the top of the skull .
One group are the cetaceans ( porpoise and whales ) .
The other are the Proboscidians ( elephants ) . ”
As Munns points out , interestingly , “ in mammals , the presumption of a trunk is freely given to any skull with high nares . ”
A macraucheniid litoptern produced by Schleich , pictured from Darren Naish ’s private collection , and , of course , found in my International Cryptozoology Museum too .
As shown above in a model replica highly prized by myself and Darren Naish , there is a perfect instance of the trunk conception as evidenced in the fossil evidence in action .
Munns writes : “ In mammalian paleontology , whenever high positioned nares are found in a skull , a trunk is presumed .
And particularly , in the somewhat camel - like Macrauchenia , as described in R. Savage and M. Long ’s book Mammal Evolution ( pages 164 and 165 ) , it says : ‘ The cranium is short and the muzzle long with the nasal opening high on the roof of the skill ( as in sauropod dinosaurs ) .
Macraucheniids must have been very strange beasts – camel - like with a proboscis . ' ”
With regard to whether sauropods have trunks , Bill Munns ’ rationalizations are solid , and his “ vote is most emphatically yes to the trunk hypothesis . ”
His imagery with regard to these dinosaurs is remarkable , as demonstrated by what he has allowed me to share on these pages .
In personal communication with Munns , this work might indeed have some relationship to the hunt for the supposed dinosaurs of the Congo , Mokele - Mbembe , as hinted in my headline .
The artist has written me : “ The sauropod trunk concept is interesting , in that if by some miracle , they do find a dinosaur in Africa , it might be a sauropod , and we might know the answer to the question .
We can hope . ”
Bill Munns works on the Gigantopithecus head .
Munns ’ creations are fantastic , and just to move away from his Gigantopithecus and the sauropods for a moment , here are two samples of what he envisioned for two saber - toothed - appearing felines from the La Brea Tar Pits , Smilodon ( a true saber - toothed cat of the Felidae , subfamily Machairodontinae ) and Dinictis ( a false saber - toothed cat of the Nimravid family ) .
I find Munns ’ reconstructions of these cats quite beautiful :

Sometime next year , Polaroid will stop producing instant film .
There have been lots of people jumping in to help save the format , and others writing some striking eulogies , as the rest of us start mourning the oncoming loss .
But one thing I can’t quite shake is what Polaroid represents to me , something that will likely be on its way out the door too : the visual metaphor of a photograph .
Tangible Metaphors
That little picture window , framed in white with justthismuch more spacing on the bottom so you can hold it .
The fucking thing was begging to be held , passed around , shared , pinned up , torn , and written on .
It ’s a triumphant visual institution .
The humble visual of a Polaroid picture , practically synonymous with the idea of photography , will eventually start fading from the general consciousness like the cassette tape , film reel , and rotary telephone .
Sure , we ’ll remember this stuff , but our grandkids and great - grandkids will just look at us with quiet concern as we ramble on about the sounds we heard coming off giant vinyl disks .
How long do we hold onto past iconography to represent modern concepts ?
The record might only represent the concept of music to some , perhaps the cassette a few more , the CD more still , but how long before iTunes needs to change its icon because the CD metaphor is n’t what currently means “ music ” ?
The process of photography has seen so many changes in the past decade , that even the methods we use to describe the act have changed .
When someone mimes you the act of taking your photo , chances are they do n’t hold an imaginary box up to their eye anymore , they hold an imaginary box a foot away from their face , as if they are looking at a digital camera ’s LCD screen .
The language , mannerisms , and visual associations we have with photography are being replaced .

L/ Cpl Croucher has served in Iraq and Afghanistan Lance Corporal Matt Croucher looks slightly uncomfortable to be hailed a hero , as he listens to his citation for the George Cross awarded for his outstanding bravery .
It is a medal awarded only rarely , for " acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme danger " .
And the 24 - year - old Royal Marine reservist 's actions were exactly that .
Split second decision
On February 9th this year , while in Helmand Province with 40 Commando Royal Marines , his Commando reconnaissance force was sent out to investigate a Taliban compound where they suspected bombs were being made .
Mission accomplished , they were walking out when L / Cpl Croucher felt himself walk into a tripwire .
The booby trap pulled the pin out of a grenade .
He told me that what happened next was instinctive . " I saw the grenade land in front of me , so I had a split second decision to decide what to do .
I had a quick look around and there was nowhere to take cover .
I knew there was two lads who were directly behind me and a third further back than that , " he says .
" A grenade 's usually got a 5 m killing circumference .
" So I thought , I 'm going to get seriously injured whatever I do so I might as well jump in front of the grenade and at least try and save the rest of the lads from getting seriously injured or killed themselves .
So I lay in front of the grenade . "
I ask what was going through his mind as he did so .
Being awarded the George Cross is a huge honour , for me and for 40 Commando .
But there are so many acts of bravery by the lads that do n't make it into the press .
It 's all part of the job - they would have done the same .
You just do it
L/ Cpl Matt Croucher
" When I was lying there , I had that same feeling in your stomach you have when you 're a small child and you 've done something really naughty and you know you are going to get into lots of trouble for it .
" So I lay there just gritting my teeth , waiting for the explosion to go off . "
It went off but - remarkably - he was virtually unscathed , while his colleagues were shielded by him and his backpack from the worst of the blast , leaving only one of them with minor injuries .
" He acted to save his comrades in the almost certain knowledge that he would not himself survive , " said the Chief of the Defence Staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , as he announced the honour .
" His exemplary behaviour and supreme heroism are fully deserving of the nation 's highest recognition . "
L/ Cpl Matthew Croucher with his backpack , torn by the grenade L / Cpl Croucher still has the rucksack that took the main impact of the blast - a tattered green daysack shredded by the grenade as it helped save his and his comrades ' lives .
His helmet is only slightly peppered by shrapnel .
He himself suffered severe bruising but no lasting injuries - and his citation makes clear that immediately after the incident he refused to be evacuated for medical care but insisted on carrying straight on with the next mission , taking on the Taleban in a fire - fight and killing one of the enemy .
He clearly is in the best tradition of British military heroes : uncomfortable with the limelight , preferring to play down his heroism .
He served as a regular Royal Marine for five years , including two tours of Iraq - the first during the invasion of 2003 .
So he is accustomed to combat , and loath to boast of his achievements .
But he admits : " Being awarded the George Cross is a huge honour , for me and for 40 Commando .
But there are so many acts of bravery by the lads that do n't make it into the press .
It 's all part of the job - they would have done the same .
You just do it . "
Proud parents
His parents were unaware of what had happened until their son sent them a text .
Standing proudly next to him as he held up his citation for the cameras , his mother Margaret says she remembers well the day she heard .
" I got a text saying he was back at Camp Bastion ( from his forward operating base ) , so I knew something had happened .
" The next text from him said there had been an incident .
And the third that he might be put up for a medal and meet the Queen and could I believe it ?
I texted back to say : ' Knowing your antics , yes . ' "
She and his father Richard smile .
They say it was n't his first brush with death , remembering a fall from a wall 30ft up which their son survived several years before , along with numerous close calls during fire - fights .
They are hoping he will make it to collect his medal from Buckingham Palace later this year without further incident .
Though that is not guaranteed .
These days , L / Cpl Croucher is working as a director of a security company , Pinnacle Risk Management , which provides close protection for its clients .
It is now no secret that he would be a good man to have at your side in a tricky situation .

Yellow ribbons .
They 're everywhere .
And they mean nothing .
Good , goose - stepping Americans put them on their cars to " support the troops . "
How about supporting the troops by making sure they 're not sent to die in illegal , ill - conceived wars waged by lying psychopaths ?
If you 're going to put a ribbon on your car , how about a black one to show that you mourn those killed and injured , you oppose the war , and you oppose having our military hijacked by a gang of treasonous thieves .

After loosing three congressional seats in traditionally Republican districts , the Republicans are now setting themselves up for more losses , but this time in the Senate .
For some reason , Republicans are having a heck of a time finding anyone either qualified or willing to run for the Senate .
As a result , some of their proposed candidates are almost amusing :
Bob Kelleher , the Republican nominee in Montana is in favor of socialized medicine , nationalizing the nation ’s oil and gas industries , and raising taxes significantly in order to eradicate poverty .
And yes , he is running as a Republican , even though he has previously run ( and lost ) 15 times as a Democrat and as a member of the Green Party .
Christopher Reed , who might be running in Iowa against Tom Harkin , although he has yet to open up a campaign bank account ( even though it is required in order to do fundraising ) .
Jim Ogonowski might have been a decent Republican nominee in Massachusetts to run against John Kerry , but he came 30 signatures short of the 10,000 signatures necessary to get on the ballot , and then decided to drop out .
In Arkansas , the Republicans failed to find any candidate at all to challenge Mark Pryor .
The Democrats ca n’t resist having a little fun at the GOP ’s expense .
They have set up a web page called Rotten Recruits ( reminiscent of the movie recommendation site Rotten Tomatoes ) , complete with reviews and even a fake movie trailer :

For months now I have been looking for a classic clip of Larry King drunk on his radio show that I heard way back in the dawn of the public Internet when my friend downloaded it from a newsgroup .
It 's NOWHERE online now .
My friend finally found the cassette tape he transfered it to back then ( yes , a cassette tape ! ) and redigitized it .
After some digging , it appears this recording was made between 1987 and 1994 when his radio and tv shows overlapped .
This witching hour call - in segment was called Open Phone America .
According to Wikipedia , the phones would open up at 3 a.m. for callers to discuss any topic they pleased with Larry .
Give it a good listen .
Really picks up halfway through .

Hey , the HuffPo typed it up !
Caller : I 'm a student of print journalism , and I just wanted to know : what advice do you have for young people coming up into the field ?
Like , a lot of our professors are telling us how hard it is to get into the field at first .
I 'd just like to know , since you 're in the field , if you have any advice on that .
[ silence ]
Caller :
For instance , experience : is that important ?
Larry King :
Uh huh , sure .
Caller :
Is that probably the most important ?
Larry King :
Well , it 's way up there .
Caller :
It 's way up there ... anything else ?
Larry King : Pressure under fire , done this before , I do n't want this to be his first surgery .
Caller : Okay ...
Larry King : Applied himself well .
These are the things that I 'd have confidence in a young M.D. Caller : Okay ... I 'm talking about the journalism field .
Larry King : I 'm lost , what do you mean ?
Caller : Journalism ... I 'm a student of journalism at a college and I was just wondering the most important aspect of getting into journalism .
Not the medical field .
I think you 're exhausted from 30 nights .
Larry King : I am exhausted from 30 nights .
No person , even those of us who are superhuman , those of us with Herculean appetites for the diverse and the bizarre , even those of us who have shown an aptitude to fight the good fight and stay the good long battle ... even those of us can get tired .
And your boy is tired after 30 consecutive nights .
I have a half hour to go and I 'm gonna do that half hour because I 'm a pro , and that 's what pros do .
I 'm a pro-fessional .
Look it up in the book .

Larry King :
That 's what we do , we 're pros .
We 're never rude and we do n't cop out .
We do n't tell you that we 're ill or that we 're looking for the farmhouse in the middle of the desert .
Or that we 're parched .
We do n't tell you that maybe the check did n't come through this month , and where the hell does it go anyway if you 're a guy who 's left 16 forwarding addresses ?
Caller : Okay ...
Larry King :
So what do you do ?
What is the answer ?
Yeah , you 're a little perturbed now .
Kinda worried about the club .

Do n't worry about the club .
Worry about , maybe , Jackie , my ... haha , nah , do n't worry .
Okay , just cool it .

In its Early Permian habitat in Texas , Gerobatrachus hottoni would have lived on land and water where it could lunge after insects like this mayfly Protoreisma .
A frog - like creature with a stubby tail once paddled through a quiet pond in what is now Texas , snapping up mayflies while keeping an ear out for bellowing mates , new fossil evidence suggests .
That was about 290 million years ago .
In 1995 , the amphibian specimen was discovered in fish quarry sediments in Baylor County , Texas , though it was n't until recently that paleontologists inspected and described the new species .
Called Gerobatrachus hottoni after its discoverer Nicholas Hotton , a paleontologist at the Smithsonian Institution , the creature represents a transitional amphibian , sporting features of both frogs and salamanders .
" This amphibian is from near to the point where frogs and salamanders first split , " said lead researcher Jason Anderson , a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Calgary in Canada .
" This is kind of an early frog - amander . "
The finding , detailed in this week 's issue of the journal Nature , supports the idea that frogs and salamanders evolved from one ancient amphibian group called temnospondyls .
Like modern salamanders , the fossil of Gerobatrachus has two fused bones in its ankle .
And like modern frogs , the frog - amander sports a large ear drum , or tympanic ear , which Anderson said the ancient amphibian likely used for hearing calls from mates .
" I suspect that many of the temnospondyls have a similar sort of [ tympanic ear ] system , " Anderson told LiveScience .
" But of course unless we were able to build a time machine and go back and listen to these guys call , we wo n't know for sure . "
Rather than hopping , this amphibian likely walked on land and swam in water , with the ability to lunge after prey , Anderson said .
In fact , along the evolutionary history of amphibians , frogs did n't begin hopping until the Jurassic or Triassic period .
( The most definitive hopping frog fossil is dated to the Triassic , which spans from 248 million to 206 million years ago . )
" It was found in sediments from a quiet pond with a lot of fish fossils , but I suspect it was equally comfortable on land or in water , " Anderson said .
The fossil also showed several tiny teeth that had a specialized trapping feature seen in all modern amphibians at some point in development .
The teeth are able to hinge inward when catching prey .
" It allows food to go in , but it ca n't get back out , " Anderson said .
The new species , spanning less than 5 inches ( 12 cm ) from nose to tip of tail , provides a marker of when frogs and salamanders went their separate ways along the evolutionary path toward modern forms .
" With this new data , our best estimate indicates that frogs and salamanders separated from each other sometime between 240 [ million ] and 275 million years ago , much more recently than previous molecular data had suggested , " said study team member Robert Reisz of the University of Toronto Mississauga .
The research was supported by the Museum of Natural History ( le Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle ) in Paris and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada .
Earlier this week , a separate team announced finding a yellow tree frog in Panama that also had transitional features .
Note :
If you have been the victim of domestic violence , please e-mail me and tell me about it .
What happened ?
Did you tell anyone about it ?
Why or why not ?
Did you seek help ?
Why or why not ?
If you did seek help , did you get it ?
May we publish your story here ?
We 'll do it anonymously , unless you give specific permission to use your name and / or e-mail address .
Know a man who may be battered ?
Print out this page and give it to him .
Often , it 'll be enough to get him to talk to you about it -- if not right away , perhaps in a bit .
And talking to another man about it is the first step in healing -- in survival .
Remember : TV star and comedian Phil Hartman never talked about his marital problems , either , except to joke about having to leave the house when his wife was mad .
He told everyone the marriage was wonderful -- as so many men do .

Roger Easterbrooks
Roger 's
Web site offers help for highly - sensitive and ultra-sensitive people .
We all have difficulty dealing with conflict in a relationship .
The ultra -sensitive man 's reactions to an abusive relationship are n't different , but they can be more intense .
Inside , the ultra - sensitive man is screaming , " Do n't you know what you 're doing is killing me ?
Just stop it !
If you do n't stop , I 'm going to die ! "
What happens is that an ultra-sensitive man becomes over - stimulated , a state that Roger Easterbrooks , an ultra-sensitive man himself who offers healing help to others , calls " going into overwhelm . "
Overwhelm is when you feel your physical , mental and emotional systems can't tolerate any more .
It almost feels like you 're being pounded on .
You want to run away .
You then kick into " survival mode . "
Why talk about an ultra-sensitive man 's reactions to an abusive relationship ?
Because they offer everyone - - you - - clues to figure out if you 're in an abusive relationship .
Their reactions are simply magnified and intensified , and we can see them more clearly .
If you recognize any of the patterns you see here , whether or not you 're an ultra - sensitive man , it 's time to look at whether your relationship is abusive and figure out what to do about it .
I know .
As Roger talked to me , I could see myself having the same feelings and reactions , when I was in an abusive relationship .
Was I in an abusive relationship ?
I did n't think of it that way at the time , but when she left my reaction was not grief , but an overwhelming sense of relief , as if a great burden had been lifted from me .
Sure , I felt betrayed .
Unloved .
I missed the daily intimacy of a life shared together and felt terribly alone and abandoned .
But I also felt more calm , relaxed , peaceful and centered than I had in a long time , and I experienced a new burst of positive energy .
How does an ultra- sensitive man know he 's in an abusive relationship ?
His body tells him .
Roger says you 'll notice it in your body .
Your body is tense a lot , especially through the shoulders , and your mind becomes foggy .
You may experience stomach pains , aches and pains in your body , or headaches .
Your temperature and pulse both rise .
You experience anxiety or panic attacks .
Your body is telling you , in these many ways , that something is wrong in your life , and you cannot for the life of you figure out what it is .
Look more closely -- at your relationship .
Do you dread " talks " with her ?
Does your pulse rise and your mind become foggy at the mere thought of a disagreement or conflict with her ?
Will you do anything to avoid the conflict and keep the peace ?
Do you have inexplicable aches and pains , or tenseness , and are these worse when you 're around her ?
Do you have panic attacks at the mere thought of conflict , or mere thought of being with her ?
Do you find yourself looking for a lot more " alone time " ?
Does being alone seem a lot more calming and appealing than spending time with her ?
Ultra -sensitive men have the blessing / curse of heightened awareness .
You know you are upsetting her , or that she is contemptuous of you , without her saying or doing anything -- and it hurts !
As Roger points out , ultra - sensitive men go into " survival mode " in an abusive relationship .
Despite what we hear in gender - polarized views of domestic violence , conflict is a " dance of anger " between two people , each of whom plays a role .
And ultra-sensitive men are vulnerable to being sucked into this dance , because their very survival is at stake .
They 'll feel like they 'll do anything to stop the pain , including attack .
He may shout back , and once the shouting match starts , there may even be physical violence .
There 's an irony here .
Research clearly shows that most abusive people ( women and men ) have themselves been abused .
And many women are keenly aware of , and sensitive to , being abused .
So if she 's abusive , an ultra-sensitive man who shouts back is told he 's being abusive -- he's the abuser .
He 's feeling he 's doing what it takes to ensure his survival -- to make the pain stop .
She feels he 's abusing her .
And he , with his heightened intuition and sensitivity , knows that she 'll go tell her friends how abusive he is .
What that mean , s of course , is that the ultra - sensitive man , keenly aware of her friends ' emotional cues and reactions to him , will no longer feel comfortable being around her friends .
Isolation sets in -- the kind of isolation that permits more and more abuse .
How does an ultra-sensitive man respond to an abusive relationship ?
Roger points out that there are two groups of responses , both coming out of " survival mode . "
Fight , or flight .
They 're opposite sides of the coin , the coin called " stop the pain survival . "
I saw this when I talked to Roger about battered men .
I asked him how an ultra-sensitive man who is not the one doing the abuse but the one receiving the abuse reacts .
He role - played it for me .
Your body temperature rises .
Your pulse quickens .
Your speech becomes more rapid and more confused .
You pace .
Or you retreat into absolute , deadly - calm stillness .
You want to scream out , " Stop it !
Do n't you see you 're killing me !
Just stop it ! "
You experience " overwhelm " -- you feel you physical , mental and emotional systems can't tolerate any more .
It almost feels like you 're being pounded on .
You want to run away .
As Roger says , you strike out , or you repress it .
But Roger points out that icy silence is also a form of aggression .
You become aggressive , or passive - aggressive .
Roger sees three forms of the same theme , repression : " Stuff it , "
Disconnect , and
Leave .
The problem is compounded when the woman has , herself , been abused .
If you react strongly , she will see you as an abuser .
You suddenly realize you 're going to be what she says you are , you 're going to start living her projection of you .
That 's more incentive to " stuff it " or to hide .
You already feel upset anyway and you do n't know why you 're upset .
It 's a nasty little game , and you feel you are the game ball .
Stuff it .
Much as you 'd like to scream out , you just sit there and take it .
You convince yourself that it will be over soon , that you will weather the storm , just like you did the last ones .
You do n't want to rock the boat .
You do n't shout out or even talk back , because you do n't trust your own emotions .
You want to protect her , and you 're afraid of what will happen if you stop holding back on your anger .
You 're afraid you wo n't be able to control it .
Disconnect .
You 're still in the room , but you 're not .
You 're off somewhere else .
It 's almost the same as " stuffing it , " but you do n't feel anything .
You 're " detatched , " just like a Buddhist .
In fact , Roget talks about kicking into the " Zen warrior mode . "
Or , more properly , the " wounded Zen warrior mode . "
You think you are being of service to your partner .
You 're helping her by supporting her in " letting it all out " without reacting .
" O'm taking it because I love you so much . "
( " And maybe if I take it , you 'll love me back . "
Too bad it does n't happen that way . )
We can take care of her emotional needs and emotional burst now , and deal with my emotional needs later .
But " later " never seems to come .
You know that if you " let it all out " like she 's doing , she 'll call you abusive .
Leave .
The work deadline is crushing .
It 's important to be with friends , to support them .
There 's an important workshop that will really help your self - growth and improve the relationship .
There are always very good reasons , but for one reason or another you 're just not spending as much time with her .
Truth is , if you look at it , you just " happen " to be around her less , because you feel so calm and relaxed when you 're not with her , and so tense and anxious when you are .
You do n't have to walk on pins and needles when you 're by yourself , or with other people .
The problem is compounded when the woman has , herself , been abused .
If you react strongly , she will see you as an abuser .
You suddenly realize you 're going to be what she says you are , you 're going to start living her projection of you .
That 's more incentive to " stuff it " or to hide .
You already feel upset anyway and you do n't know why you 're upset .
It 's a nasty little game , and you feel you are the game ball .
So what do you do about it , if you 're an ultra - sensitive person in an abusive relationship ?
Roger offers no pat solutions to this one .
One thing you do is what men who are n't ultra-sensitive do in abusive relationships .
Talk to other people .
Do a " reality " check with friends and acquaintances , to reassure yourself you are n't the crazy one .
Get help and advice .
Watch out for your physical safety , and have a " safety plan .
Check out the advice and resources here on MenWeb .
The important thing is to do something , rather than just pretend there 's no problem or hope it will go away .
If you 're an ultra - sensitive person , you also have to deal with that .

Last week , Microsoft published the binary file formats for Office .
These formats appear to be almost completely insane .
The Excel 97-2003 file format is a 349 page PDF file .
But wait , that ’s not all there is to it !
This document includes the following interesting comment :
Each Excel workbook is stored in a compound file .
You see , Excel 97-2003 files are OLE compound documents , which are , essentially , file systems inside a single file .
These are sufficiently complicated that you have to read another 9 page spec to figure that out .
And these “ specs ” look more like C data structures than what we traditionally think of as a spec .
It ’s a whole hierarchical file system .
If you started reading these documents with the hope of spending a weekend writing some spiffy code that imports
Word documents into your blog system , or creates Excel - formatted spreadsheets with your personal finance data , the complexity and length of the spec probably cured you of that desire pretty darn quickly .
A normal programmer would conclude that Office ’s binary file formats :
are deliberately obfuscated
are the product of a demented Borg mind
were created by insanely bad programmers
and are impossible to read or create correctly .
You ’d be wrong on all four counts .
With a little bit of digging , I ’ll show you how those file formats got so unbelievably complicated , why it does n’t reflect bad programming on Microsoft ’s part , and what you can do to work around it .
The first thing to understand is that the binary file formats were designed with very different design goals than , say , HTML .
They were designed to be fast on very old computers .
For the early versions of Excel for Windows , 1 MB of RAM was a reasonable amount of memory , and an 80386 at 20 MHz had to be able to run Excel comfortably .
There are a lot of optimizations in the file formats that are intended to make opening and saving files much faster :
These are binary formats , so loading a record is usually a matter of just copying ( blitting ) a range of bytes from disk to memory , where you end up with a C data structure you can use .
There ’s no lexing or parsing involved in loading a file .
Lexing and parsing are orders of magnitude slower than blitting .
The file format is contorted , where necessary , to make common operations fast .
For example , Excel 95 and 97 have something called “ Simple Save ” which they use sometimes as a faster variation on the OLE compound document format , which just was n’t fast enough for mainstream use .
Word had something called Fast Save .
To save a long document quickly , 14 out of 15 times , only the changes are appended to the end of the file , instead of rewriting the whole document from scratch .
On the hard drives of the day , this meant saving a long document took one second instead of thirty .
( It also meant that deleted data in a document was still in the file .
This turned out to be not what people wanted . )
They were designed to use libraries .
If you wanted to write a from - scratch binary importer , you ’d have to support things like the Windows Metafile Format ( for drawing things ) and OLE Compound Storage .
If you ’re running on Windows , there ’s library support for these that makes it trivial … using these features was a shortcut for the Microsoft team .
But if you ’re writing everything on your own from scratch , you have to do all that work yourself .
Office has extensive support for compound documents , for example , you can embed a spreadsheet in a Word document .
A perfect Word file format parser would also have to be able to do something intelligent with the embedded spreadsheet .
They were not designed with interoperability in mind .
The assumption , and a fairly reasonable one at the time , was that the Word file format only had to be read and written by Word .
That means that whenever a programmer on the Word team had to make a decision about how to change the file format , the only thing they cared about was ( a ) what was fast and ( b ) what took the fewest lines of code in the Word code base .
The idea of things like SGML and HTML — interchangeable , standardized file formats — did n’t really take hold until the Internet made it practical to interchange documents in the first place ; this was a decade later than the Office binary formats were first invented .
There was always an assumption that you could use importers and exporters to exchange documents .
In fact Word does have a format designed for easy interchange , called RTF , which has been there almost since the beginning .
It ’s still 100 % supported .
They have to reflect all the complexity of the applications .
Every checkbox , every formatting option , and every feature in Microsoft Office has to be represented in file formats somewhere .
That checkbox in Word ’s paragraph menu called “ Keep With Next ” that causes a paragraph to be moved to the next page if necessary so that it ’s on the same page as the paragraph after it ?
That has to be in the file format .
And that means if you want to implement a perfect Word clone than can correctly read Word documents , you have to implement that feature .
If you ’re creating a competitive word processor that has to load Word documents , it may only take you a minute to write the code to load that bit from the file format , but it might take you weeks to change your page layout algorithm to accommodate it .
If you do n’t , customers will open their Word files in your clone and all the pages will be messed up .
They have to reflect the history of the applications .
A lot of the complexities in these file formats reflect features that are old , complicated , unloved , and rarely used .
They ’re still in the file format for backwards compatibility , and because it does n’t cost anything for Microsoft to leave the code around .
But if you really want to do a thorough and complete job of parsing and writing these file formats , you have to redo all that work that some intern did at Microsoft 15 years ago .
The bottom line is that there are thousands of developer years of work that went into the current versions of Word and Excel , and if you really want to clone those applications completely , you ’re going to have to do thousands of years of work .
A file format is just a concise summary of all the features an application supports .
Just for kicks , let ’s look at one tiny example in depth .
An Excel worksheet is a bunch of BIFF records of different types .
I want to look at the very first BIFF record in the spec .
It ’s a record called 1904 .
The Excel file format specification is remarkably obscure about this .
It just says that the 1904 record indicates “ if the 1904 date system is used . ”
Ah. A classic piece of useless specification .
If you were a developer working with the Excel file format , and you found this in the file format specification , you might be justified in concluding that Microsoft is hiding something .
This piece of information does not give you enough information .
You also need some outside knowledge , which I ’ll fill you in on now .
There are two kinds of Excel worksheets : those where the epoch for dates is 1/1/1900 ( with a leap - year bug deliberately created for 1 - 2 - 3 compatibility that is too boring to describe here ) , and those where the epoch for dates is 1/1/1904 .
Excel supports both because the first version of Excel , for the Mac , just used that operating system ’s epoch because that was easy , but Excel for Windows had to be able to import 1 - 2 - 3 files , which used 1/1/1900 for the epoch .
It ’s enough to bring you to tears .
At no point in history did a programmer ever not do the right thing , but there you have it .
Both 1900 and 1904 file types are commonly found in the wild , usually depending on whether the file originated on Windows or Mac .
Converting from one to another silently can cause data integrity errors , so Excel wo n’t change the file type for you .
To parse Excel files you have to handle both .
That ’s not just a matter of loading this bit from the file .
It means you have to rewrite all of your date display and parsing code to handle both epochs .
That would take several days to implement , I think .
Indeed , as you work on your Excel clone , you ’ll discover all kinds of subtle details about date handling .
When does Excel convert numbers to dates ?
How does the formatting work ?
Why is 1/31 interpreted as January 31 of this year , while 1/50 is interpreted as January 1st , 1950 ?
All of these subtle bits of behavior cannot be fully documented without writing a document that has the same amount of information as the Excel source code .
And this is only the first of hundreds of BIFF records you have to handle , and one of the simplest .
Most of them are complicated enough to reduce a grown programmer to tears .
The only possible conclusion is this .
It ’s very helpful of Microsoft to release the file formats for Microsoft and Office , but it ’s not really going to make it any easier to import or save to the Office file formats .
These are insanely complex and rich applications , and you ca n’t just implement the most popular 20 % and expect 80 % of the people to be happy .
The binary file specification is , at most , going to save you a few minutes reverse engineering a remarkably complex system .
OK , I promised some workarounds .
The good news is that for almost all common applications , trying to read or write the Office binary file formats is the wrong decision .
There are two major alternatives you should seriously consider : letting Office do the work , or using file formats that are easier to write .
Let Office do the heavy work for you .
Word and Excel have extremely complete object models , available via COM Automation , which allow you to programmatically do anything .
In many situations , you are better off reusing the code inside Office rather than trying to reimplement it .
Here are a few examples .
You have a web - based application that ’s needs to output existing Word files in PDF format .
Here ’s how I would implement that : a few lines of Word VBA code loads a file and saves it as a PDF using the built in PDF exporter in Word 2007 .
You can call this code directly , even from ASP or ASP.
NET code running under IIS .
It ’ll work .
The first time you launch Word it ’ll take a few seconds .
The second time , Word will be kept in memory by the COM subsystem for a few minutes in case you need it again .
It ’s fast enough for a reasonable web - based application .
Same as above , but your web hosting environment is Linux .
Buy one Windows 2003 server , install a fully licensed copy of Word on it , and build a little web service that does the work .
Half a day of work with C# and ASP .
NET .
Same as above , but you need to scale .
Throw a load balancer in front of any number of boxes that you built in step 2 .
No code required .
This kind of approach would work for all kinds of common Office types of applications you might perform on your server .
For example :
Opening an Excel workbook , storing some data in input cells , recalculating , and pulling some results out of output cells
Using Excel to generate charts in GIF format
Pulling just about any kind of information out of any kind of Excel worksheet without spending a minute thinking about file formats
Converting Excel file formats to CSV tabular data ( another approach is to use Excel ODBC drivers to suck data out using SQL queries ) .
Editing Word documents
Filling out Word forms
Converting files between any of the many file formats supported by Office ( there are importers for dozens of word processor and spreadsheet formats )
In all of these cases , there are ways to tell the Office objects that they ’re not running interactively , so they should n’t bother updating the screen and they should n’t prompt for user input .
By the way , if you go this route , there are a few gotchas , and it ’s not officially supported by Microsoft , so read their knowledge base article before you get started .
Use a simpler format for writing files .
If you merely have to produce Office documents programmatically , there ’s almost always a better format than the Office binary formats that you can use which Word and Excel will open happily , without missing a beat .
If you simply have to produce tabular data for use in Excel , consider CSV .
If you really need worksheet calculation features that CSV does n’t support , the WK1 format ( Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 ) is a heck of a lot simpler than Excel , and Excel will open it fine .
If you really , really have to generate native Excel files , find an extremely old version of Excel … Excel 3.0 is a good choice , before all the compound document stuff , and save a minimum file containing only the exact features you want to use .
Use this file to see the exact minimum BIFF records that you have to output and just focus on that part of the spec .
For Word documents , consider writing HTML .
Word will open those fine , too .
If you really want to generate fancy formatted Word documents , your best bet is to create an RTF document .
Everything that Word can do can be expressed in RTF , but it ’s a text format , not binary , so you can change things in the RTF document and it ’ll still work .
You can create a nicely formatted document with placeholders in Word , save as RTF , and then using simple text substitution , replace the placeholders on the fly .
Now you have an RTF document that every version of Word will open happily .
Anyway , unless you ’re literally trying to create a competitor to Office that can read and write all Office files perfectly , in which case , you ’ve got thousands of years of work cut out for you , chances are that reading or writing the Office binary formats is the most labor intensive way to solve whatever problem it is that you ’re trying to solve .

Listen to an interview with Alain Robert
Updated , 6:30 p.m. | Alain Robert , a French stuntman known for climbing tall buildings , scaled the north face of the New York Times building on Thursday , ascending 52 stories to the roof and clutching a bright green banner , before police officers arrested him around 12:22 p.m.
( Update : Hours later , a second man was arrested after climbing to the roof on another part of the building .
For a complete account of the day ’s events , see the article prepared for Friday print editions . )
Police and security officials cordoned off the sidewalk below , on West 41st Street , as a crowd assembled .
The words on the banner were illegible from the sidewalk , but from office windows inside the tower the slogan on the banner could be clearly read : “ Global warming kills more people than 9/11 every week . ”
The man later confirmed , moments after being arrested on the roof of the tower , that he was Alain Robert , a 46 - year - old stuntman famous for scaling structures like the National Bank of Abu Dhabi , the Sydney Opera House in Australia and the Eiffel Tower and Montparnasse Tower in Paris .
He wore a T - shirt with his name and the address of a Web site ( thesolutionissimple.org ) , exercise pants and climbing shoes .
He had long blond hair .
He used no rope , harness or parachute .
Police officers blocked off the sidewalk at the base of the building and asked members of the crowd to move along .
Construction workers on a building directly across West 41st Street , facing the northern face of the building , looked on with expressions of astonishment and amusement .
A crowd gathered on the sidewalk , pointing , gawking and capturing pictures and images with cellphones , digital cameras and video cameras .
“ This is a publicity stunt , it looks like , ” Janet L. Robinson , the chief executive of The New York Times Company , said as she entered the building .
“ There is definitely going to be an arrest . ”
Wearing a backpack slung over one shoulder , Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. , the chairman of The Times Company and publisher of The Times , who is himself an avid climber , ducked under the police tape and examined the spectacle .
He declined to comment .
Do you intend to join a road safety class ?
If yes , you must prepare well to perform well in your class .
Driver error , according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) is one of the main contributors to accidents in the United States of America .
As a result , it ’s essential to consider factors such as impaired driving , speeding , distracted driving , and driver tiredness .
Concentrate more on road safety to reduce the number of occurring accidents .
You can get this done by receiving adequate education in the right school .
While educating yourself on road safety , there ’re necessary items you should carry to a road safety class .
Keeping aside the obvious things , such as shoes , clothing , pillows , blankets , and the likes , here are the prerequisites to accompany you to a road safety class .
Stationery
Packed lunch or snack for break
Grilled food
Pizza
Granola Bars
Vegetarian chili
Broccoli grain and Pork bowl
Apple salad and Kale

9 Things You Can Bring with You to a Road Safety Class
Stationery
Stationery items are a crucial part of any student ’s life .
These tools were purposely invented by our ancestors to help pass on knowledge and have significantly evolved from their initial use to , currently , modified with technology .
While some might consider them as futile tools , they form the basis of education .
Stationary such as pencils , eraser , sharpener , tools of geometry and notebooks are essential in taking notes , drawing , taking tests , making assignments , and school projects .
Packed lunch or snack for break
According to the road freight and transport industry , nutrition plays a vital role in ensuring drivers ’ alertness and fitness behind the wheel .
A few quantities of snacks or packed lunch is recommended for general health and well - being .
As you ’d pack your items the night before traveling from home , also ensure to plan your lunch or snack before leaving for your road safety class and store in an insulated cooler ( or storage containers ) .
When choosing snacks , make sure you pick those that empty calories and add extra sodium to your diet - a handful of nuts , watermelon slices , bananas , and a bottle of water is ideal .
However , when it comes to packed lunch , not all foods are equal in class .
For instance , there is that person whose bag of pizza produces so much noise that it ’s difficult to concentrate on the teacher ’s intriguing lecture .
On the other hand , some try to juggle their pen , spoon , notebook , and yogurt on their tiny tables .
In both ways , you are easily distracted and may not focus on the classroom ’s agenda .
That aside !
For the best foods to carry into your road safety class , peep into your childhood lunchbox for some motivation .
They include :
Grilled food
Grilling entails cooking food over a heat source on a rack , usually ceramic briquettes or a charcoal fire .
Before heading to your class , you can choose the most delicious grilled food to carry , such as shrimp , chicken , duh , steak , veggies , etc .
Roasted food produces a nice crust and pleasant flavors while direct heat sears food resulting in a distinctive robust .
Opt for a pellet smoker for grilling if you are looking for a smoky flavor in your meat , use a pellet smoker for grilling .
A pellet smoker grill is a more versatile and more complicated outdoor cooker that combines the elements of charcoal - ovens and gas grills .
They use hardwood pellets , which allow pellet grills to provide indirect or direct heat .
Just like ovens , a pellet grill entitles you to precise digital temperature control ; hence , you can decide to either cook slower or faster .
Pizza
If you ’re looking to carry an irresistible , customizable , and easy to make lunch , homemade pizzas are the real deal .
There are various forms of pizza recipes you can use .
But , you can choose between thin and thick crust pizza you can easily cook perfectly in an outdoor pizza oven .
An outdoor pizza oven is a freestanding or a built - in oven powered by charcoal , wood , or gas .
Unlike your regular home ovens , which lose much heat when opening the door , outdoor pizza ovens can maintain extreme temperatures of up to 800 degrees F while baking — kind of like the difference between cooking your steak with a cheap aluminum skillet or a cast - iron skillet .
Granola Bars
Although ordinary granola bars may not be more nutritious , they have a more portable and comforting taste .
Previously , Quaker oats bars used to be my favorite necessity , but after looking at the label , they do n’t amuse me at all .
Instead , try creating them from scratch .
Make these earlier enough for a super easy lunch for class all week .
Vegetarian chili
Vegetables and beans add an enormous bite to this chili .
With a dash of hot sauce and fiery spices , it ’s guaranteed to power your day .
Broccoli grain and Pork bowl
A fresh , spicy broccoli grain and pork bowl add fun to your lunch break .
To keep you fully satisfied , the pork , sweet potato , and quinoa combo are enough .
But , they ’re not heavy enough to make you sleep at your desk .
Apple salad and Kale
Of all the foods you can think of , Kale is considered one of the healthiest you can rely on , and it ’s even more nutritious when consumed raw .
It ’s softened in a lemon dressing and tossed in a blend of cheese , apple , almonds , and dates .
A little pecorino gives this nutritious salad an in - depth level of satisfaction .
Outfit
Make sure to select a comfortable and practical outfit that ’s easier to move around with .
Avoid any restrictive footwear and clothing .
For instance , flip flops and high heels are n’t ideal in road safety classes .
Conclusion
With the above considerations to your road safety class , you ’ll be guaranteed an unruffled environment to quickly pursue your studies .
However , when it comes to food , pick the ones you are comfortable with and suits your budget .
Phusion Passenger ’s development continues on .

Thanks to TonyLa for reporting and analyzing this problem .
Fixed a memory leak
Due to an unfortunate little mistake , each time a client disconnects from the ApplicationPoolServerExecutable will result in a small memory leak .
In practice , it means this : if your Apache is configured to restart * worker threads or worker processes often ( say , every 10 requests or so ) , then each time that happens , a small memory leak will occur .
For most people this is not a problem , because by far most Apache servers are configured to never restart worker threads / processes , or only restart a worker thread / process after several hundred thousand requests .
This leak did n’t catch our attention because we used a standard Apache configuration ( Ubuntu default ) .
Once again , many thanks to TonyLa for reporting and analyzing this problem .
(* =
This has got nothing to do with the ‘ apachectl restart ’ or ‘ apachectl graceful ’ command .
These commands restart Phusion Passenger entirely , and will not result in any memory leaks .
We were only referring to Apache ’s internal process of restarting worker threads and worker processes . )
Fixed a compilation problem for some people
This has been fixed .
How do I upgrade to 2.0.2 ?
Via a gem
Please install it with the following command :
gem install passenger
Next , run :
passenger - install - apache2- module
Please do n’t forget to copy & paste the Apache config snippet that the installer gives you .
Via a native Linux package
Neil Wilson from Brightbox has kindly provided an Ubuntu 8.04 package for Phusion Passenger .
The package is available from the Brightbox repository which you can find at :
http://apt.brightbox.net
Add the following line to the Third Party Software Sources :
deb http://apt.brightbox.net hardy main
( The simplest way to do that is to create a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ containing the deb anstruction , and then run ‘ apt - get update ‘ ) .
Once you ’ve done this then you can install Phusion Passenger by running :
apt - get install libapache2 - mod - passenger
( Note that Neil is currently packaging 2.0.2 , so it might take a while before this release shows up in the apt repository . )
In a move that could have broad implications for the high - performance computing ( HPC ) market , Intel and Cray have announced a broad collaboration that will see engineers from the two companies work together on future products and projects .
With the first Intel - Cray products appearing in the 2010 - 2011 timeframe , it 's clear that three Intel technologies have caught Cray 's eye : the native 32nm Sandy Bridge microarchitecture , the QuickPath Interconnect ( QPI ) scheme , and the forthcoming discrete , x86 - based graphics product , codenamed Larrabee .
Cray will plug all of these components into its SeaStar interconnect fabric , and when combined with Cray Linux they 'll make for an HPC and floating - point monster .
The first piece of the Intel - Cray puzzle is Sandy Bridge , which will debut in 2010 as Intel 's first native 32nm processor .
Unlike its predecessor , Westmere , which is a 32nm die shrink of the 45nm Nehalem , Sandy Bridge will be designed from the ground up for the 32nm node .
One of Sandy Bridge 's most widely talked - about features is a brand - new set of 256 - bit vector extensions called Advanced Vector Extensions ( AVX ) .
In addition to vector registers that are double the size of the current 128 - bit SSE registers , AVX will also introduce a nondestructive three - operand format for the first time in the x86 ISA 's history .
( For more on the operand format issue , see either Chapter 8 of my book . )
In all , AVX 's vector length and new operand format will massively boost the peak theoretical floating - point performance of Intel 's microarchitecture , making it a vector beast that can eat up as much bandwidth as Cray can throw at it .
( Note that AltiVec coders are turning their nose up at AVX , but it still seems like it has to be an improvement .
I hope to take up this issue and others in an AVX vs. Larrabee Vec - 16 vs. SSE5 article at some point . )
Speaking of bandwidth , Intel 's QuickPath Interconnect , with debuts with Nehalem later this year , will be firmly established by the time Sandy Bridge drops .
QPI will give Cray the ability to do with Intel 's processors what it already does ( and will apparently continue to do ) with AMD's , that is , plug them into the company 's high - bandwidth interconnect fabric , SeaStar , via a bridge chip .
Cray XT3 nodes with SeaStar interconnect and AMD64 / HyperTransport hardware
The graphic above is taken from a Cray XT4 brochure , and it shows two Opteron nodes attached via HyperTransport to Cray 's 3D SeaStar interconnect fabric .
An Intel - based Cray supercomputer will probably look similar , but with QPI swapped for HyperTransport and Sandy Bridge and / or Larrabee processors swapped for Opterons .
Cray SeaStar node
The HyperTransport interface in the SeaStar router node shown above would be swapped with a QPI interface , an effort that would require some engineering help from Intel and is likely to be the first place that the two companies collaborate .
Moving on to Intel 's Larrabee , which is also slated for the 2010 timeframe , Cray CEO Peter Ungaro told TGDaily that Cray expects to integrate the many - core GPU product into its Intel - based supercomputers .
Intel 's Larrabee
What 's not clear is the method that Cray would use to integrate Larrabee into its products .
The most obvious option would be to put Larrabee - based PCIe daughtercards into some of the Sandy Bridge nodes via a PCIe - to - QPI bridge .
Another , possibly cheaper and more power - efficient option would be available if Larrabee supports QPI ; in this case , Larrabee coprocessor sockets could be dropped right into the QPI fabric along with Sandy Bridge processors .
Intel has n't said , however , if Larrabee has a QPI interface or not ; it 's clear from an earlier leaked slide that it does have a PCIe interface , though .
The reason for including Larrabee in the new Cray supercomputers is pretty straightforward : each Larrabee core has a 512 - bit vector floating - point unit that can grind through twice as many FLOPS as Sandy Bridge .
The combination of Sandy Bridge 's 256 - bit vectors and Larrabee 's 512 - bit vectors will make for a very potent x86 vector processing machine , and it's the kind of thing that NVIDIA is already trying to get out in front of with its escalating verbal war against Intel CPUs .
One thing that worries some developers as they look at Larrabee and Sandy Bridge is that they 'll have different vector extensions , and both of these will be different from AMD 's forthcoming SSE5 extensions .
There are no details yet on how Intel will get AVX and Larrabee 's 512 - bit extensions to work together , but I 'm sure that whatever they have in mind involves this EXOCHI " accelerator exoskeleton with an IA ' look - n - feel ' " that I have n't quite figured out yet .
For their part , NVIDIA and AMD are n't standing still in the HPC space by any means .
Word recently got out that NVIDIA Tesla GPUs will play a prominent role in an upcoming French supercomputer , and by the time 2010 rolls around those Tesla GPUs will look a lot like Larrabee in that they 'll have a fairly robust and flexible ISA that exposes a ton of vector floating - point resources .
AMD is also moving ahead with its HPC - oriented GPGPU plans , and the company already has a well - established place in Cray 's XT3 and XT4 supercomputers that is likely to persist .
Still , Sunnyvale can't be happy with Intel moving in this close on a piece of critical turf in the HPC arena that has been so kind to Opteron .

All salmon fishing banned on West Coast CALIFORNIA
Salmon fishing was banned along the West Coast for the first time in 160 years Thursday , a decision that is expected to have a devastating economic impact on fishermen , dozens of businesses , tourism and boating .
Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez immediately declared a commercial fishery disaster , opening the door for Congress to appropriate money for anyone who will be economically harmed .
The closure of commercial and recreational fishing for chinook salmon in the ocean off California and most of Oregon was announced by the National Marine Fishery Service .
It followed the recommendation last month of the Pacific Fishery Management Council after the catastrophic disappearance of California 's fabled fall run of the pink fish popularly known as king salmon .
It is the first total closure since commercial fishing started in the Bay Area in 1848 .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency last month and sent a letter to President Bush asking for his help in obtaining federal disaster assistance .
Schwarzenegger plans to appropriate about $ 5.3 million for coastal salmon and steelhead fishery restoration projects .
The disaster declaration allows state officials to work with Congress on obtaining appropriations for businesses and fishermen and women , some of whom will lose as much as 80 percent of their annual income .
Although salmon spawning has been in decline all up and down the coast , the biggest problem is in the Sacramento River and its tributaries .
So few salmon returned last fall that the fishery council was required under its management plan to halt fishing throughout the salmon habitat , which is all along the California and Oregon coasts .
The commercial salmon season off California and Oregon typically runs from May 1 to Oct. 31 .
The recreational season was to have begun April 5 .
The eXiled Coat of Arms Is Back With A Vengeance
One month ago , our newspaper
The eXile got stomped into extinction by some ham - fisted Russian government officials , who decided that since there ’s a new president in the Kremlin who ’s talking up some nonsense about a new “ liberal era , ” what better way to show your boss that you understand what he means by “ liberal ” — with a big wink - wink — than to shut down the only good thing that Russia ever had going for it .
On June 5 , four officials from the Ministry to Defend Russian Culture — one of whom was an FSB lawyer seconded out to ministry — arrived at our radon - poisoned basement office in Chisty Prudy to carry out an “ unplanned [ ie : ordered ] audit ” of The eXile ’s articles .
As the head of the Glasnost Defense Fund NGO told us , we were the first and still only Moscow newspaper to ever be subjected to an “ unplanned audit ” of our editorial content .
What a fucking honor it was .
They came exactly on time , 11 am — just like Stalin ’s proverbial trains .
There they were , all fitted out in their crusty retro-Soviet outfits , subjecting us to a three - hour interrogation about Edward Limonov and the Recession Penis and why did we write the things we write and why do we mock and insult Russia ’s great culture and great traditions …
The officials were surprisingly polite and by - the - books during the audit , but that did n’t matter , because they still scared the shit out of anyone with an understanding of Russia ’s past and present .
The Ministry to Defend Russian Culture ( since renamed the “ Federal Agency for Media and Communications ” ) is merely the least scary ministry in the extremely - scary Russian state apparatus — so saying that the RosOkhranKultury was n’t all that scary is like saying that the eyeball - like pits on the sides of a Flecker ’s Box Jellyfish ’s bell are n’t all that scary compared to its 60 deadly tentacles — which pack the most toxic venom in planet earth ’s seas .
The slightest contact with one of the box jellyfish ’s 10 - foot - long tentacles , and you ’d wish that you could trade places with one of Mengele ’s victims : the box jellyfish ’s venom literally sizzles through your flesh like Alien blood , eating its way into your blood vessels , racing through your circulation system like a burning gunpowder fuse , until finally the venom reaches your vital organs and napalms the entire fucking thing like it ’s a Vietnamese village , turning your organs into a pot of boiling jelly , and transforming you — brave , chin - up little you — into a screaming , gargling , blood - puking freak — a one - note freak , to be precise — that note being : “ PLEASE SOMEONE FUCKING KILL ME NOW !
AGGGHHHH !!!! ”
So when the four Russian government officials finally left our offices , and we realized we were n’t dead or in jail , at first we were kinda relieved , like , “ Hey , we bumped into a Flecker ’s Box Jellyfish and all we touched were its slit - eyes , and you know , there ’s more to that creature than venom and tentacles . ”
But then a few hours later we came to our senses and realized , “ Um , wait a minute — as a matter of fact , there is n’t much more to that creature than venom and tentacles . ”
And speaking of venomous tentacles , a Duma deputy ( and former Nashi spokesman ) Robert Schlegel went on Govorit Moskva radio a few days after the audit and announced , “ I do n’t have to read The eXile to understand that it is guilty of extremism . ”
It was time to get out of the venomous - vermin - infested waters .
We ’d been spotted by the jellyfish ’s eye - like pits .
The Flecker ’s Box Jellyfish does n’t have a brain , but it does have four “ nerve- nets ” connecting the eye - pits to the tentacles .
Only a fool would stick around to see how the Flecker ’s Box Jellyfish , or its human variant “ the Russian government , ” will react after it takes a stack of eXile articles for “ analysis , ” articles which contain lines like “ Russian Government is bloody beast eating human flesh ” and we “ fart in Russia ’s face ” and “ urinate into the president ’s mouth . ”
How does a jellyfish ’s nerve - net read lines like that ?
Does it get angry and want to thrash its venomous tentacles around ?
Since we do n’t want to be the subject of some future Werner Herzog documentary called “ Flecker ’s Box Jellyfish Man , ” we decided to respect Mother Nature and leave the venomous jellyfish to their brainless floating - death world , while we ’ll go back to ours .
Flee : it ’s what our investors did when they pulled a David Copperfield disappearing act on us a week before the auditors rolled into our office … and that ’s what we did after the Russian government ’s highly - unusual audit of our paper .
And that ’s how The eXile died : just as it was born : in sin and in epic glory .
We were never like the others : the fake - alternative , fake - angry papers .
That ’s why our spectacular death has pissed off so many people who never had the nerve to go where we went , and who always wanted to see us snuffed out — quietly , without a fuss .
We lived out our name as we lived out everything else .
We ’re now in true eXile , just as we ’d announced from the beginning 11 years ago — and that is why we ’ve named the new online webzine that we ’re launching today “ The eXiled . ”
It ’s now an accomplished fact .
But our job is n’t done .
We ’ve got a lot of bile yet to be pumped , a lot of unfinished business — and thanks to our readers , we ’ve got a little pot of money to fuel our insurgency against what we can only describe as “ the fucks . ”
You know who we ’re talking about here .
How will “ The eXiled ” differ from our now - abandoned Mother Ship , the USS eXile ?
For starters , we ’ve pulled out of Russia for good — we ’re not going to stick around there and see what the ministry experts think of our literary golden shower into Medvedev ’s mouth .
Like the pro-Chechen site kavkaz.org , we ’ve moved our servers out of Russia and to a secure location that ’s more appropriate .
Which in our case means that we ’ve moved our operations to Panama .
Yes , Panama .
Just because we like the sound of it .
Fact is , Russia just ai n’t fun anymore .
We ’re bored of all the overpriced low - quality nonsense that governs every aspect of that birch - infested bog .
We ’ve moved to somewhere a little nicer , where we can exchange our mud-stained parkas and boots for loose - fitting short - sleeved Hawaiian shirts , and where we no longer get harangued into “ bonding ” with the locals via their filthy peasant drug alcohol , because we can bond with Pedro and Manuel via their clean pure white rock cocaine , a far superior and more noble substance .
I mean , everyone in Panama smiles all the time !
A cynic might say “ That ’s because they ’re fucking cokeheads ! ” to which we could only reply , “ Cynic ! ”
Unless we ’re on coke , in which case we ’d answer , “ Haha !
Yeah , you ’re totally right .
In fact , I never thought of that before … ”
So , what do you folks out there in reader - land have to look forward to here ?
Death .
But before you die , we at The eXiled will be there to hold your hand and make sure your last days and months on this planet of ours really , really hurt .
We ’re the doctor who refuses to give you morphine for that tumor eating its way through your pancreas , telling you , “ We do n’t think it ’s right for you to cop out and get high simply because you ’re in excruciating pain day and night , and you ’ll continue to shriek in pain until you finally die from shock in about four months , which is really three months and twenty - nine days more than any living creature could possibly bear .
So , suck it up , you nation of whiners you ! ”
What sort of pain - enhancing medicine are we at The eXiled prescribing you ?
All of your favorites from The eXile , and more .
With one big difference : instead of being Russia - centric , we ’re going to be as unabashedly America - centric as we ’ve always bashedly been .
Fuck Russia — we ’re tired of working out on the second - stringers .
While the focus is shifting , The eXiled staff is essentially the same .
The eXiled ’s editorial junta consists of : Mark Ames , Yasha Levine , eXile guru Dr. John Dolan , and our latest and bestest addition to our Evil Justice League , Eileen Jones .
Most of the contributors will be with us too , starting with Gary Brecher who ’ll publish two “ War Nerd ” columns per month at The eXiled .
Reviews and rants — Dr. Dolan ’s literary reviews , Ms. Jones ’ film reviews , and so on — will be classified under our new “ Fatwahs ” section .
Yasha Levine will be our special undercover Evil Empire correspondent , ( thankfully the Russian government ’s pit - eye has n’t trained its nerve - net on Mr. Levine yet ) .
For all of you wondering what happened to Vlad Kalashnikov , so far it looks like he ’s agreed to come back again , starting to write for us next week .
( Did you hear that , Daniel Allen ? )
We ’ll also have a new feature called “ The eXiled Factor , ” whereby
The eXiled ’s editorial junta will conduct a kind of topical McLaughlin Group pundit - riffing .
And just so you know , there will be NO open commentary allowed to readers .
That is the first fatwah of The eXiled .
You will send letters to sic@exiledonline.com and you will take what we give you and be happy with it .
We used to be patient and reasonable people until our paper was shut down .
We saw things in people close to us that …well , we ’ll never be reasonable to anyone ever again .
It ’s war from here on out .
