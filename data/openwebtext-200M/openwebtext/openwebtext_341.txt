Gary Hart : Media hyping Dem candidates ' negatives David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Tuesday March 25 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Former senator Gary Hart is criticizing the sensationalistic tendencies of the media in the 2008 Democratic nomination process .
Appearing on CNN's ' Newsroom , ' the onetime Democratic presidential contender said , " The media plays a role in all this , and when producers or networks decide to recycle charge after charge after charge and go to the other campaign and ask for responses , that 's what you 're going to see on television . "
Hart , a supporter of Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) , continued , " I do n't mean to point the finger , but it 's not as if the media plays no role here .
If the media focuses on budget deficits , on casualties in Iraq and elsewhere , on the failures of Bush economics , then I think the voters will tune in . "
The Colorado Democrat , who halted his own run for the White House in 1987 after intense media scrutiny of an alleged extramarital affair , rued the constant news focus on videos of former Obama pastor Rev. Jeremiah Wright .
" If you see nothing but Rev . Wright hour after hour , day after day , and the Obama campaign is asked to respond to that endlessly , that 's the news , " said Hart , adding that such coverage makes it " very , very difficult for candidates to refocus on what is really important for this country 's future .

Log analysers are not accurate .
They over - report visits and over - count some browsers while under- counting other browsers .
They cannot accurately distinguish spiders and robots from human visitors and they do not use fool - proof techniques for counting visits and visitors .
Spiders and robots are programs which are sent out to web sites to index it , check links or to fetch content .
Your web browser is also a program : spiders and robots are essentially no different to a web browser in terms of what they can do .
And , as it happens , some browsers can be set up to send out link - checking robots .
There are thousands of spiders and robots visiting web sites .
We 've been compiling a database of them for the past 10 years .
We use it to filter out spiders and robots from our own site stats .
A staggering 90 % of page requests to this web site ( www.limov.com), for example , are by spiders and robots .
There are a handful of legitimate spiders but many are programs created to harvest e-mail addresses , copy content or to look for vulnerabilities in your web server .
It is in the originator 's interests that their programs look like regular visitors so that they gain full access to your site .
I use examples from actual logs in this article , mostly from this web site .
Spiders visit web sites and follow links on a page , normally to collect content so that it can be indexed by search engines .
They can also collect specific content such as e-mail addresses , images , and PDFs .
Robot is a term I use to describe programs which make single - hit visits , often hitting the same page at regular intervals .
Robots do n't follow links .
You do n't need to be a computer expert to have your own spider .
Source code is freely available online .
I will use ' bot ' for the remainder of this article to refer to both spiders and robots .
In this section , I 'll be covering server log structure , how bots are supposed to identify themselves and how you can find rogue bots in logs .
If you know all this , skip to the next section .
You need to know the difference between requests and hits to be able to interpret web logs and stats .
Requests refer to pages .
Most web pages include a mixture of text and images .
The images are included in the page as links to files on the server .
If a web page includes 10 graphics , accessing the page will result in 1 request and 11 hits , with one log line per hit .
Every hit made to a web site is logged .
A hit can vary from finding out whether a page or file has been updated to fetching web pages , style sheets , images and other files , such as PDFs .
Failed requests are also logged , for example when a page has been removed or when it 's password - protected .
Failed hits also include hacking attempts to invoke vulnerabilities in ( mostly ) Microsoft Windows servers .
This information is logged for each hit :
IP address or host - where the request comes from
- where the request comes from username - the username of an authenticated user ( via .htaccess )
- the username of an authenticated user ( via .htaccess ) date / time - date and time of access
- date and time of access request - request type ( GET / POST / HEAD )
- request type ( GET / POST / HEAD ) URL - what was requested
- what was requested version - HTTP version
- HTTP version status code - success / failure code
- success / failure code size - number of bytes downloaded
- number of bytes downloaded referrer - URL of referring page
- URL of referring page user - agent - how the browser identifies itself
' Agent ' is a term used for tools sent out to act on your behalf .
Browsers and bots are agents .
Here are actual logs lines resulting from a visitor displaying one web page , the Colour Selector entrance page ( I 've changed the IP address ) :

By the user - agent
If it fetches robots.
txt
By its behaviour
Spiders and robots usually identify themselves in the user - agent .
However , there is no standard text that they 're supposed to add to the user - agent ( such as " I'm a spider " ) so that they can be found .
This means that there is no automatic way that programs which process logs to produce stats can detect them .
A list of spider and robot user - agents and IP addresses must be maintained on an on - going basis so that these visitors are not included in your regular web site stats .
This does not happen automatically .
Web developers can put instructions in text files for spiders to make some parts of the site off limits .
This could be for peformance reasons .
The instructions are put on the server in a file called robots .
txt .
Spiders and robots are supposed to read this file at the start of each visit but there 's no way to enforce that they do .
Most bots ignore the file .
However , if a visitor does access robots .
txt , it 's most likely a spider .

There are long gaps between visits .
If Baiduspider has n't been added to your web site stat program 's filter file for spiders ( assuming one exists ) , then this spider 's visits will show up as regular one - page visits in your web site stats .
Next is a suspect series of visits .
The log lines appear together in an uninterrupted block in the log file .
The log lines of human visitors are usually interleaved as people take longer between requests compared to spiders .
The accesses shown people are from different IP addresses but they all refer to the same session id .
The session id is a unique visitor id we add to the URL if we can't out it in a cookie .
The IP addresses are from different countries .

Is it a coincidence that different people in different countries happened to visit this web site using the same session id in the URL within a few seconds of each other , each only fetching web pages and not the images and style sheets ?
I 'd say this was a spider .
There is nothing in the host or user - agent information which allows us to recognise it .
Only its odd behaviour gives it away .
To filter out this visitor from my custom stats in future , I have to block it by the session id and / or all the IP addresses it used .
In addition to using algorithms to process standard server logs , people can develop custom logs with extra information .
They track visitors by putting a generated unique session id in the URL or write it to a cookie .
The id is read back at every request so that the request can be logged against the session id .
If you do n't use session ids , you can make some guesses on which request are from the same visitor by looking at the server logs .
The same host IP address in a short period
The referring page is from another web site
The user - agent looks like a browser
However , any of these might change within a visit .
This is what I 've found from reviewing server logs regularly .
Spiders can be sent cookies and allow them to be reread by a site on subsequent visits .

When examining raw logs , it is common to see a single visit in which each page access is from a different host .
This is how visitors appear in logs when their connection is via a cacheing proxy .
Here is a visitor to the Colour Selector who made 17 page requests from ten different hosts during a single three - minute visit .
Most log analysers will interpret these page requests as ten separate visitors .

This second example is from an AOL user .
Four images were viewed during a visit , each from a different host ( and IP ) address .

And , because of cacheing proxies or people who use services such as AOL , different visitors can look like the same visitor if you look only at their host address .
The referring URL is information that is sometimes made available to the web server .
It is the URL of the page which included a link to your web site which was followed by the visitor ( for example , a page on your site might get listed in a search engine ) .
For the first page request of a visit , the referring URL will tell you the address of the page on another web site from where a link was followed .
For subsequent pages , referrers will be pages within the site .
It is n't always the case that the referring site will only appear as the referrer for the first page in a visit because people use the browser 's Back button a lot .
You might expect log lines for a visit to follow the trend of each page being the referrer of the next page accessed .
The log lines of a made - up a visit are shown next .

However , when you look at your web server logs , you will see that people manage to get to pages from a page which does n't include any links to the new page .
That is because they got to the new page from a link on an earlier page that was cached .
When a visitor uses their browser to go back to a cached earlier page , the page is n't logged at the web server ; the redisplay of a cached page means the browser gets the page from cache and not from the server .

Given this , it is possible that someone can reach your site from a link on another site , explore your site for a bit but then return to the entry page through the browser 's Back button .
In this event , the first page request in the visit would have a referrer of another web site .
Subsequent pages would have internal referrers but then the new outside referrer would reappear in the logs .

Another scenario that explains such a visit pattern is when a web site is accessed through multiple browsers .
The choice of earlier and later pages on screen to interact with will contribute to the lack of a coherent path through the site in the logs .
In addition , anecdotal evidence suggests that people with screen resolutions higher than 800x600 browse with multiple windows .
In the case of a site like this , where the session id is carried around in the URL , this behaviour becomes apparent when the log includes visits from the same referrer and from the same host address and user - agent .

It is possible for a different referring site to appear during a visit .
The next visit is of a visitor to this site via Google but with a different referring site for the sixth page request .
time page requested referring page 01:17:36 / colour / http://www.google.com/search?q=color+palettes
01:18:07 /library/guidelines.lml /colour / 01:18:39 /library/promotion.lml /library/guidelines.lml 01:18:43 /journal/ /library/promotion.lml 01:22:12 /library/promotion.lml /library/guidelines.lml 01:22:27 / journal / http://www.thestudyofdesign.com/links_magazines_l.asp
During their visit , they created a link to our site from theirs ( complete with the session id in the URL ) and then presumably tested the link which explains the appearance of the second outside referrer .
You can't rely on time between requests to decide if it's a new visit .
This is because people might start something at work in the afternoon - go home without closing their browser - then come back and expect to carry on with whatever 's in their browser .
In this event , a gap between page requests could easily be 17 hours .
It is not uncommon to see gaps of an hour or two in logs .
If accesses from the same host have a gap of more than 30 mins , WebTrends counts is as from different visitors .

It is possible for the user - agent to change within a visit .
When it happens , it 's usually a robot visitor but it can also happen with human visitors .
The log lines below are a 183 - page visit from the same IP address .
This can be recognised as a spider by the quick requests in a short space of time .

Users can change the user - agent sent to web servers in browsers ( e.g. , Internet Explorer , Mozilla , Opera , Konqueror and Lynx ) and spiders .
If these visitors are n't know by stats programs , their visits will be counted in browser stats .
On average , 10 % of human visitors to this web site can't or wo n't accept cookies .
With a cookie - enabled browser , web users have control of how cookies are used .
They can accept all cookies
They can only accept cookies from certain domains
They can only accept certain cookies from certain domains
They can reject third - party cookies , those from a domain different to the current site
They can remove one of more cookies
They can edit the cookie contents
Regardless of what browser is used , it is always possible to remove cookies within a visit .
Cookies may be removed deliberately , perhaps in a big clearout , or become corrupted or lost during a disk crash .
One can't assume that a ) cookies get written or that b ) they 'll remain on visitors ' computers .
StatMarket 's HitBox counts visitors by use of third - party cookies .
People can easily configure their browsers to reject third - party cookies - those not originating from the web site they 're visiting .
If someone visits a site with a HitBox counter and their browser rejects the cookie , HitBox will count every page request as a new visit .
HitBox over - counts visits .
Example : imagine a site that had 2,000 actual visits in one day with three requests on average .
The true visit count is 2,000 .
If our 10 % non -cookie figure is typical , HitBox would correctly count 1,800 ( 90 % of 2,000 ) of the visits .
However , it would process the 600 ( 10 % of 2,000 visits x 3 pages ) page requests as visits , producing an incorrect total of 2,400 visits .
A lot of web sites are optimised for Internet Explorer because it 's easier for developers to ignore other browsers ; until a couple of years ago , the Marks and Spencers web site turned away Mozilla users , telling them to get a better browser .
To get around this problem , modern browsers let users set the user - agent to something else .
This is usually MSIE , since so many sites are optimised for IE .
Sometimes the only indication that a visitor is robot is the time between accesses .
Our sites have repeat visitors which accept cookies , and have an user - agent that looks like a normal browser .
What gives them away as robots are :
They visit at regular intervals and access the same pages , such as all the links on the home page
They access all the links on a web page and in the order they appear
They access 5 - 10 pages within a second
The last behaviour is how they can be spotted in the logs as their log lines will appear in clumps .
Because so many sites are optimised for Microsoft Internet Explorer ( MSIE ) , bots send an MSIE user - agent .
if they are n't detected as bots , they 'll over - represent the proportion of IE users , misleading the site 's developers into thinking they made the right decision to turn away other browsers .
Below are log lines from a single IP address to this site .
It 's a robot specifically designed to show in the logs with certain referring sites .
This has become a trend in robots once blogs , for example , started publishing trackback links to referring sites .
These bots are basically getting other sites to publish links to their sites .

I 've spent more time than I care to admit looking at server logs and discovered unexpected behaviour by both human and spider visitors .
Because unique visitors can't be accurately detected , some browsers end up being over - or under - counted by stats .
There are still more complications .
For example , many hit counters collect stats via accesses to a GIF placed on your web pages .
Text - only browsers and screen - readers do n't access the GIF and so are never included in the browser stats .
This means that some disabled visitors are not included at all in browser stats .
I 've concluded that you must n't believe your web stats if they 're based on log analysis - they 'll tend tell you good news when the reality is likely to be discouraging .
Lifehacker Australia interviews Linus Torvalds
Linus Torvalds is one of the most influential hackers in modern computing , having created the Linux kernel as an open source alternative to the Unix operating system .
He ’s since spent nearly 20 years maintaining the kernel in a leadership role ( as well as continuing to have an active coding role ) through the Linux Foundation .
Linus is a regular attendee at Linux.conf.au ( last year he was spotted tooling around the conference on a home brew Segway – possibly the geekiest moment in history ) .
He ’s back again for LCA this year , and we were thrilled to score an interview with him yesterday .
I explained to Linus that Lifehacker readers would be interested to know what his day to day computing and desktop setup was , as well as any productivity tips he might have to offer .
What transpired was much more plain and simple than you might expect .
“ I am the least organised person you ’ll ever meet .
My desk is a complete mess .
I do n’t organise my emails – everything is in one big email folder , ” says Linus .
He says that he works largely in text - based windows rather than GUIs – with multiple windows open at once .
But he ’s not a multiple monitor kind of guy .
“ I have a single monitor , 24 inch , 1920 by 1200 . ”
Even his mail reader is purely text - based – so do n’t bother sending any HTML emails .
“ I do n’t want pretty pictures , ” he explains .
“ I do n’t do word processing .
The only graphical thing is my browser ( Firefox ) .
He uses a text - based email application called Alpine ( the new version of longtime University of Washington mail app Pine ) .
“ I use the keyboardfor everything . ”
When I asked about his productivity system , he has some pretty clear guidelines in place .
“ I figured out the best way to kill productivity is to give talks and go to meetings , ” says Linus , who says he now avoids doing either .
“ Even if I prepared for a talk the night before , I ended up spending the two weeks beforehand getting stressed about it . ”
“ So my calendar is basically empty . ”
He says he plans ahead for the couple of conferences he likes to attend each year ( which include Linux.conf.au ) .
He recently pushed out the latest stable version of the Linux kernel ( 2.6.23.14 ) , deliberately timing it so he could finish it before travelling to Australia for LCA .
Another part of his productivity system is KAlarm – a reminder program for the KDE desktop .
He says having a reminder pop up for things like “ pick the kids up from school ” is a must .
So how does Linus keep in touch on the road ?
Is he a mad texter ?
Does n’t seem likely , does it ?
“ I hate phones .
I do n’t have a mobile phone , ” he says .
“ They ’re a way to spread that evilness and take it with you all the time . ”
Email is his strong preference for communicating .
“ I do n’t do any business over the phone . ”
Chat is also out – it ’s just a distraction .
“ I do n’t use IRC , I hate these chat programs .
They ’re real time so you have to answer and interact synchronously .
It just does n’t suit his workstyle , he says .
“ I ’m so bad at multi-tasking .
When I read a book , I block out everything else .
I hate phones , they disturb you .
When you have an IRC channel open , messages disturb you .
“ I want to sit in my darkened den and do it in my own time – that ’s how I work ! ”
So there you go , some plain and simple methods for keeping your work text - based , and making sure your workplace is distraction free , courtesy of geek legend Linus Torvalds .
Thanks to Linus for making the time to speak to Lifehacker AU , and to Linux.conf.au for helping set up the interview .

DOJ wins a legal battle with DNC over White House e-mails
A federal judge has handed the White House a legal victory in a battle with the Democratic National Committee over e-mails related to U.S. attorney firings .
District Judge Ellen Huvelle of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled Thursday that the DNC does not have a right under the Freedom of Information Act to 68 pages of e-mails sent between White House and Justice Department officials simply because the White House e-mail traffic was transmitted on a server controlled by the Republican National Committee .
The DNC sued the Justice Department in April 2007 after its FOIA request for the e-mails , which relate to the firing of nine U.S. attorneys , was not granted by DOJ .
Attorneys for the DNC argued that since the White House officials used " GWB43.com " e-mail addresses to send the messages , they can not be deemed to be official in nature and therefore must be turned over under the DNC 's FOIA request .
Eighty - eight White House officials were given those RNC - controlled addresses to conduct political activities , but the Bush administration later claimed that the accounts were used to handle other official business , such as interactions between the White House and senior DOJ aides on the prosecutor purge .
In dismissing the DNC lawsuit , Huvelle ruled that it was " based on the false factual premise that White House officials only used their RNC e-mail accounts for political communications . "
Additionally , Huvelle decided that just because an RNC server was used to send the messages — 68 pages out of more than 5,000 which have been denied to the DNC — it is not enough to automatically disqualify the Justice Department from claiming a FOIA exemption in refusing to release them .
" It is therefore clear that RNC e-mail accounts were used ( rightly or wrongly ) both for official and RNC business , and thus the nature of the server is not necessarily informative as to whether the document contained official or political communications , " Huvelle wrote in her opinion .
The DNC 's attorneys also argued that since the RNC evidently did not retain huge numbers of White House e-mails , this was a violation of the Presidential Records Act , which requires that all official White House records and documents be saved .
Since the White House did n't make an effort to archive the e-mails on the RNC servers , they cannot be considered as official White House business and be exempted from FOIA requests .
But Huvelle noted she was n't asked to rule on whether the White House violated the Presidential Records
Act , only whether the e-mails were exempted from FOIA requests because of their content .
Huvelle , in fact , said the failure to save the e-mails from the White House officials was " an apparently flagrant violation " of the Presidential Records Act .
Yet that was n't enough for Huvelle to order the Justice Department to turn over the requested e-mails to the DNC , even though it may open up another avenue of investigation for congressional Democrats looking into the millions of missing White House e-mails .
" However , the administration ’s violation of the Presidential Records Act is , as plaintiff acknowledges ... not before this Court , and it cannot serve as a basis for determining whether the government has properly invoked " a FOIA exemption , Huvelle wrote .
" Moreover , [ the DNC ] fails to point to any case law that would indicate that the server where an e-mail is housed is relevant to its treatment under FOIA .
Rather , under D.C. Circuit precedent , it is the content , not the form , of the communication that determines whether it is properly exempt " from FOIA .
Huvelle added : " Therefore , because the form of the document does not factor into the analysis under FOIA , the Court cannot adopt a per se rule that any e-mails sent on the RNC servers are not covered by FOIA . "
Imagine living with an agonizing headache for most of your life , only to realize that you ’ve had a bullet lodged in your brain for 64 years .
This is exactly what happened to a Chinese grandmother , Jin Guangying , who is living headache free for the first time since she was 13 , after having a rusty bullet removed from her brain .
In September 1943 , Jin was delivering food to her father , a guerilla soldier stationed in a village near her home in Xiny County , China .
She was shot in the head , just above her right ear , by the invading Japanese and immediately fell into a coma .
The bullet had already passed through a man ’s arm , losing enough momentum to remain inside her skull .
“ When I woke up , I found I was at home .
My mother had taken me back home , applied herbal medicine to my wound and dressed my head in layers of bandages , ”  said Jin .
Jin recovered in 3 months , but would suffer from relentless headaches for the next six decades .
“ When she suffered from the headaches , she would sometimes babble words we could hardly understand , foaming at the mouth , and sometimes she pounded her head with her fist , ”  said Wang Zhengping , Jin ’s daughter .
While the headaches grew worse over the years , her family could not afford to take her to the doctor .
Her family finally had to borrow money for an x-ray that revealed the 3 cm long bullet .
On May 3 , 2007 after a 4 hour operation doctors removed the rusty bullet .
“ If the bullet had passed through Jin ’s head , she might have died immediately , because usually the wound left by a bullet leaving the human body will be much larger than the one created when it enters , ” said Zhou Tang , head of surgery at the Renci Hospital of Suyang County .

The FBI has gone through nearly all of its $ 500 millon budget for making old telephone switches wiretap friendly , but an FBI survey showed that nearly 40 percent of the nation 's switches still are n't up to federal wiretapping standards , according to a new report from the Justice Department 's inspector general .
When listening in to criminals , the FBI uses DCS - 3000 to connect to wiretap - friendly telephone switches .
Colored photo- illustration : Frank Rodriguez / Wired A 1994 law known as the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act or CALEA requires all telephone switches installed after 1995 to comply with detailed wiretapping rules , and Congress set aside a half billion dollars for the FBI to dole out to help carriers make older landline switches compliant .
Cell phone switches , however , are all compliant and nearly all FBI surveillance targets cell phones and pagers .
In 2005 , the feds got some 1800 criminal wiretap court orders , along with nearly 2,200 court orders for anti-terrorism and foreign intelligence wiretaps .
According to a redacted report ( .pdf ) from the DOJ's Inspector General , the FBI has only a little more than $ 5000 left in dedicated CALEA funds , which mostly went towards paying switch manufacturers to write wiretapping software and issue licenses to use that software for older switches .
The audit says it is not possible to tell if the money was well - spent , since neither the telecoms nor the switch makers are keen on sharing information .
Though the FBI has a well - earned reputation for bungling large technology projects , the FBI successfully built a sprawling surveillance network that taps into key telecom facilities around the country .
The Digital Collection System comprises dedicated surveillance nodes around the country that run specialized software packages for criminal and intelligence wiretaps .
The feds use a secure Sprint fiber optic network to interconnect the surveillance centers .
Though the internet was originally exempt , the government changed the rules later and as of May 2007 , all cable , DSL and satellite internet companies also have to make their networks wiretap compliant .
Even some universities have to comply as well .
Surveillance of VOIP calls jumped 400 % in 2006 , according to the report , despite the number of old wireline switches that are not yet compliant .
But the feds biggest complaint remains that wiretaps are too expensive .
Cox Communications , for instance , charges $ 1,500 for a 30 day wiretap or for 60 days of real - time call record information .
Some telecoms have even shut off wiretaps after the FBI repeatedly failed to pay their spying bill .
Separately , the FBI also has secret contracts with a few carriers , paying each around $ 1.5 million a year to store telephone records for longer periods and to respond quicker to subpoenas and court orders .

A robot chef was cooking octopus balls autonomously at the Osaka Museum of creative industries last month .
The device was created by Toyo Riki of Japan .
The food - savvy robot wears a towel twisted rakishly over its upper module .
The octopus balls are made individually , each one carefully made from scratch .
The octopus balls are made in thirds ; the cooking delicacy must be hand - turned after each portion cooks to add the next bit of dough , creating a perfect octopus ball .
The final steps include putting the octopus balls on a plate , basting each one with sauce , and shaking on some spices .
The purpose of the demonstration is not to create a finished robot chef product , but to demonstrate robotic capabilities .
As far as I 'm concerned , though , these treats look ready to eat .
Bring on the robot chefs !
Science fiction fans have been waiting almost a century for tasty treats prepared by tireless automatons ; consider Edgar Rice Burroughs who , in his 1912 story A Princess of Mars , wrote about them :
Kantos
Kan led me to one of these gorgeous eating places where we were served entirely by mechanical apparatus .
No hand touched the food from the time it entered the building in its raw state until it emerged hot and delicious upon the tables before the guests , in response to the touching of tiny buttons to indicate their desires .

Patenting Abstract Ideas Violates The Constitution , Group Says
WASHINGTON - Introducing a rare argument applying the First Amendment to patent law , the American Civil Liberties Union filed a friend of the court brief today urging a federal court to uphold the denial of a patent that would , if awarded , violate freedom of speech .
In the brief , the ACLU argues that Bernard L. Bilski is seeking a patent for an abstract idea , and that abstract ideas are not patentable under the First Amendment .
" The court must ensure that any test it uses in determining whether to award a patent is in line with the Constitution , " said Christopher Hansen , senior staff attorney with the ACLU First Amendment Working Group , who filed the brief .
" If the government had the authority to grant exclusive rights to an idea , the fundamental purpose of the First Amendment - to protect an individual 's right to thought and expression - would be rendered meaningless . "
In 2006 , Bilski sought a patent for his idea that the weather risk involved in buying and selling commodities could be minimized if sellers had conversations with two buyers instead of one .
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied his request and the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the denial .
Bilski appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , and the court has agreed to hear the case in a single joint session in May .
" Patent law prohibits the patenting of abstract ideas , but recently the courts and the patent office have been granting patents that consist essentially of speech or thought , " said Hansen .
" If the government continues to allow patents of speech or thought it risks violating the First Amendment .
No one can have a monopoly on an idea or prohibit speech on a particular subject . "

“ I wish you could conduct a campaign on policy and policy differentiation , ” Howard Wolfson , Senator Hillary Clinton ’s campaign communications director , said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday morning .
He added that Clinton “ would like nothing more . ”
This was moments after Wolfson and Phil Singer , another top Clinton aide , had hammered Barack Obama for having held a fundraiser during his first state senate campaign in Illinois at the home of William Ayers , a professor of education at the University of Illinois and a former aide to Chicago Mayor Richard Daley , who was a member of the radical Weather Underground Organization , which was responsible for several bombings in the early 1970s .
Ayers was never arrested for his activities .
But in 2001 , he did say , “ I do n’t regret setting bombs . ”
The issue had come up during the previous night ’s debate .
Responding to a question about Ayers , Obama had said , “ the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when I was 8 years old , somehow reflects on me and my values , does n’t make much sense . ”
Wolfson , this morning after , insisted that Obama had “ to be more forthcoming about that issue ” and state clearly whether it had been “ appropriate ” to attend a fundraiser at Ayers ’ home .
When it came time for questions for Wolfson , I asked an obvious one : Did Hillary Clinton believe that it had been appropriate in 2001 for President Bill Clinton to have pardoned two members of the Weather Underground as he left office ?
The two recipients of Clinton ’s munificence were Linda Evans , who was sentenced to five years in prison for her participation in a string of 1980s bombings , and Susan Rosenberg , who was charged with participating in a bank robbery that left one guard and two police officers dead .
And , I continued , has Senator Clinton ever criticized this decision ?
Has she ever said anything publicly about it ?
Rosenberg , I noted , had been apprehended with 740 pounds of explosives in her possession .
Wolfson replied , “ I am not aware of Linda Evans or Susan Rosenberg … hosting a political event for Senator Clinton . ”
I interrupted to note that I had not asked whether they had .
I had asked whether Clinton had supported or opposed her husband ’s pardons for these two women .
( I resisted the urge to throw in Marc Rich . )
Wolfson responded that while I have the right to ask questions the way I see fit , he has the right to answer them in the manner he chooses–and then I can evaluate his reply .
( Given that the Clinton aides do take many questions from all comers , I could not argue with him on that . )
Wolfson went on to accuse the Obama campaign of trying to conflate the pardons and the Ayers issues .
And indeed it is .
The Obama campaign did disseminate email about the Weather Underground radicals pardoned by Bill Clinton .
Wolfson then maintained the critical difference here is that Ayers had been a “ key supporter ” of Obama .
I tried again : the question is whether Senator Clinton believes the pardons for Rosenberg and Evans were appropriate .
Wolfson replied “ I am not an expert on the pardons … .
I do n’t know what she said ” about them .
Could he find out and get back to us ?
Yes , he said .
During the call , Wolfson said , “ voters deserve as much information about the candidates as possible . ”
And Clinton ’s view of the Weather Underground pardons , given her campaign ’s effort to pump up the volume of the Ayers matter , certainly meets that standard .
By the way , Wolfson added that neither Linda Evans or Susan Rosenberg had ever hosted an event for Senator Clinton–just in case any of the reporters had missed that point .
He added that Clinton had not raised the issue at the debate on Wednesday night .
True , but now her campaign had–and it was signalling it would keep doing so , as part of an effort to tie Obama to a “ terrorist . ”
The ploy was a clear one .
In this instance , you do n’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows .
WASHINGTON  Starting next month , people here will be able to rent a bicycle day and night with the swipe of a membership card .
A new public - private venture called SmartBike DC will make 120 bicycles available at 10 spots in central locations in the city .
The automated program , which district officials say is the first of its kind in the nation , will operate in a similar fashion to car - sharing programs like Zipcar .
The district has teamed up with an advertiser , Clear Channel Outdoor , to put the bikes on the streets .
“ There ’s a lot of stress on our transit systems currently , ” said Jim Sebastian , who manages bicycle and pedestrian programs for Washington ’s Transportation Department .
Offering another option , Mr. Sebastian said , “ will help us reduce congestion and pollution , ” as well as parking problems .
Eliot Spitzer said he had violated his obligations to his family
Eliot Spitzer 's apology
His top Republican opponent in the New York Assembly gave him up to 48 hours - until early on Thursday - to resign .
Mr Spitzer has not admitted paying for sex , but he did tell a news conference that he had let down his family .
There is also speculation he might face criminal charges , amid a reported inquiry into financial transactions .
The allegations against Mr Spitzer , a high - profile Democrat who campaigned for ethical leadership , have caused widespread shock in New York and US political circles .
New Yorkers share their views on the Eliot Spitzer scandal
In pictures
The Wall Street Journal quoted " a person close to " the governor as saying he was likely to resign , perhaps by the end of the day .
New York Assembly Republican Minority Leader James Tedisco said : " If he does not resign within the next 24 to 48 hours , we will prepare articles of impeachment to remove him .
" We need a leader in place that has the support of people on both sides of the aisle , " Mr Tedisco told reporters .
The assemblyman 's spokesman told the BBC that the business of state government would be paralysed until Mr Spitzer left office .
The Republicans would need support from the Democratic majority in the assembly to start impeachment proceedings .
Lost trust
The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says Mr Spitzer has taken on a big Manhattan law firm - possibly in anticipation of being charged .
The investigation began last year when banks reported irregular transfers to the Internal Revenue Service , which traced them back to Mr Spitzer and discovered they were made to a high - priced prostitution ring , an unnamed law enforcement official told the Associated Press ( AP ) news agency .

The account of events matched that reported earlier by the New York Times .
Mr Spitzer , 48 , was overheard during a surveillance operation arranging to meet a woman - " Kristen " - in a Washington hotel last month , the AP source alleged .
Kristen was described by the prostitution agency as a " petite , pretty brunette " , according to a federal court document , the source said .
Investigators had found that Mr Spitzer was a repeat customer with the agency , called the Emperors Club VIP , the official said .
He allegedly paid more than $ 4,000 for the woman 's services .
No charges have been brought against Mr Spitzer , and he has not admitted any offence .
But he did tell a packed press conference at his Manhattan office : " I have disappointed and failed to live up to the standard I expected of myself .
" I must now dedicate some time to regain the trust of my family , " he added , as his wife of two decades , Silda , stood by his side .
' Ruined '
There was little sympathy on display for Mr Spitzer , a first - term Democratic governor who was known for his relentless pursuit of office - holders suspected of wrongdoing .
HAVE YOUR SAY Political machinery in New York 's capital will force Eliot Spitzer 's resignation Andy , New York , USA
An editorial in the Wall Street Journal said : " Governor Spitzer , who made his career by specialising in not just the prosecution , but the ruin , of other men , is himself almost certainly ruined . "
Kenneth Lovett , of the New York Post , said : " It 's hard to see how he can remain as governor - or why he should . "
Mr Spitzer , a father - of - three , was elected governor in November 2006 .
As New York 's attorney general , he had become known as " the sheriff of Wall Street " for his campaign against financial crime .
His successes in that battle led Time Magazine to name him " Crusader of the Year " in 2002 .
Mr Spitzer has been a close ally of New York Senator Hillary Clinton , and a prominent supporter of her campaign to be the Democratic nominee for president .
This scandal is embarrassing for her , and he will make things difficult for her if he does not resign quickly , says the BBC's North America editor , Justin Webb .

President Karzai says the judiciary will decide Perwiz Kambakhsh's fate
Perwiz Kambakhsh was convicted after a summary trial in the north of the country last month .
He was accused of distributing an article he found on the internet questioning why Muslim men could practise polygamy but not women .
His treatment has sparked an international outcry .
The case against Mr Kambakhsh , an Afghan , was heard behind closed doors and he was denied a defence lawyer .
He denies the charges .
Mr Karzai was speaking during a visit to Kabul by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and British Foreign Secretary David Miliband .
Petition
President Karzai said they had raised the issue of the journalist .
It was now a matter for the judiciary , he added .
On Wednesday , Afghanistan 's Defence Minister said the legal process was not over yet and he doubted the journalist would be executed .
But reports say tribal elders and clerics in the eastern city of Gardez have called for the government to uphold the death sentence .
A British newspaper , which has collected nearly 70,000 signatures in a petition to save Mr Kambakhsh , quoted his family as saying Taleban prisoners in the same jail attacked him because they thought he had rejected Islam .
A dialogue concerning the need for the real number system .
As any mathematics undergraduate knows , in the hierarchy of number systems that goes N , Z , Q , R , C , ( that is , positive integers , integers , rationals , reals , complex numbers ) the biggest jump in sophistication is that between Q and R .
In order to understand the real numbers properly , you are forced to think about limits , whereas the other jumps ( including the one from R to C ) just involve finite algebraic manipulations .
Why do we bother to make this effort ?
How " real " are the real numbers anyway ?
Most of the dialogue to follow is between three imagined characters : M , a mathematician who takes the real numbers for granted , S , a sceptic who is not prepared to learn about anything without being absolutely convinced that it is necessary , and U , an undergraduate who has recently learnt basic analysis .
Towards the end , a logician , L , tries to sort out some of the mess .
( My apologies if , in my ignorance , I put words into the logician 's mouth that no self - respecting logician would utter . )
Part I . The need for specific real numbers .
Part II .
The need for a general theory of real numbers .
Part III .
The intermediate value theorem .
Part IV .
What is an arbitrary sequence ?
S. I was looking at a maths book today and saw a whole lot of complicated stuff about ordered fields , Dedekind cuts , Cauchy sequences - whatever they all might be .
Surely I do n't need to learn all that just to understand simple numbers ?
M. Well , the real numbers are n't as simple as they seem .
S. That was clear from the book I saw , but why bother with them at all ?
M. What would be the alternative ?
The Greeks thought they could get away with rational numbers and then discovered that the square root of two was not rational .
In other words , if you put all the rational points on a line , you will find that you have left gaps .
S. Of course I wo n't have .
M. Yes you will - for example , you wo n't have included root two .
S. That 's hardly a gap .
It 's just a single number missed out .
M. OK , by " gap " I did n't mean a whole interval without any rational numbers .
I just meant that you would have missed out some numbers like root two , and many others as well .
S. And what makes you so sure that those numbers actually exist ?
You talk as though the Greeks discovered an objectively existing object , the square root of two , which was not rational .
But in what sense did they discover it ?
Did they build an exact square and measure its diagonal ?
Of course not - infinite precision is impossible .
It makes no sense of an actual physical object to say that its length is irrational .
Maybe Plato believed in a spiritual realm full of perfect geometrical objects , but I do n't .
M. Neither do I , and I agree with much of what you say .
Indeed in practice it is not just infinite precision that is impossible : we can't measure anything to more than about 15 significant figures .
And when computers model physical situations , they content themselves with rational numbers , obtained by truncations .
But I think you are misunderstanding the relationship between mathematics and physics .
We do n't introduce the real numbers because some physical objects actually have irrational lengths .
Rather , we do so because they are a uniquely good model for physical length .
With the reals everything works neatly - and one can contrast this with a computer simulation , where complicated approximations are made the whole time .
S. So what you are saying is that even if the square root of two does n't have a direct physical existence , it is nevertheless a very convenient mathematical construct that allows us to talk about lengths of diagonals in an economical way ?
M. Yes .
S. Well , I agree with that , but I do n't think it 's a justification for the entire real number system .
Ca n't you just take the rationals plus a few other important numbers like the square roots of two , three , five and so on ?
M. It depends what you mean by " and so on " .
S. All right , I 'll take all possible roots of all rational numbers .
M. That wo n't do , because for example the square root of two plus the square root of three is n't itself a root of anything .
S. Fine , put that in too , and all sums and products of roots of numbers .
M. What about roots of the things you end up with ?
For example , something like ( 21/2+31 /2) 1/2 .
S. Yes , put them in too .
In fact , put in any number you can make from rational numbers using addition , multiplication and the taking of roots .
M. And you think you could live with that as your number system ?
S. I do n't see why not .
M. Well , for a start you can't even solve all polynomial equations in that system .
It 's not at all obvious that you can't , but in fact there are polynomials of degree five with integer coefficients that do not have solutions that can be built out of rational numbers using just addition , multiplication and taking roots .
S. Is n't that something to do with Galois ?
M. Yes .
The insolubility of the quintic was actually proved by Abel , but Galois greatly extended Abel 's discovery so that one could analyse individual polynomials in a completely systematic way .
U. Hello .
Am I interrupting ?
M. Not at all .
I 'm trying to persuade S here of the usefulness of the real numbers .
I think he 's about to concede that one needs at least the algebraic ones .
S. What are those ?
M. They are all solutions of polynomial equations where the polynomials have integer coefficients .
S. Yes , I 'm happy with those , though a question does occur to me .
If there are quintics you can't solve in an obvious way , why are you so sure that they have solutions ?
M. Maybe U can answer that one for us .
U. Indeed I can , as we did that recently in lectures .
Consider the quintic
P(x ) =ax5+bx4+cx3+dx2+ex+f .
Without loss of generality a is positive , and then it's not hard to show that when x is large and positive , so is P( x ) , and when x is large and negative , so is P( x ) .
So , by the intermediate value theorem , somewhere in between there must be some x where P( x ) =0 .
S. You 're leaving me behind .
What 's the intermediate value theorem ?
M. I wo n't give you a precise statement for now , but I think I can convince you in this instance .
Just think of the graph of the polynomial P we 're talking about .
It is continuous , in the sense that it does n't make sudden jumps .
If for some values it is below the x-axis and others it is above , then in between it has to cross somewhere , because it does n't jump , and where it crosses you have a solution of P( x ) =0 .
S. That sounds pretty convincing .
So let 's include all algebraic numbers then .
In fact , I 'd have been happy to grant you that long ago .
It 's all this strange theoretical treatment of real numbers that I do n't go for .
M. I could , I suppose , point out that e and pi are not algebraic , but let me first try to explain why a more abstract , theoretical approach to numbers is needed .
Results like the intermediate value theorem are n't true for the rational numbers - for example , the graph of x2 - 2 does n't cross the x -axis at a rational point - and when you start trying to justify your intuition that it is true , you find yourself inventing the real numbers .
S. That sounds interesting , if a little hard to imagine .
U. I 'm interested in that as well .
Are you saying that defining the real number system is in some sense forced ?
M. Yes .
I mean , even a basic concept like continuity does n't make proper sense without the real numbers .
U. Why not ?
M. Well , take the function f defined on the rational numbers by f(x ) =1 if x 2 < 2 and f( x ) =0 otherwise .
This function clearly has jumps at plus or minus root two ( not that I am saying that those are rational numbers ) and yet , according to the definition of continuity , f is a continuous function .
U. Hmm , let 's see .
If x is a rational number then x does n't equal root two , so x is contained in a small interval where f is constant .
So f is continuous at x .
True for all rational x , so f is continuous .
S. What on earth are you two talking about ?
The function you 've defined has two whopping great jumps and you 're saying it 's continuous ?
M. It looks strange at first , but the point is that continuity is defined as a local property .
Intuitively , a function f is continuous at x if f(y ) is close to f(x ) whenever y is close to x .
Then we say that it is continuous if it is continuous at every x .
S. Well , I 'd need to think about that one , but all I can say is that if your definition of continuity makes the function you defined earlier a continuous one , then it 's not a very good definition .
M. That 's what you might think , but actually it turns out to be an extremely good definition .
It does n't quite coincide with our intuitive notion of what a continuous function should be - something like a function whose graph you can draw without lifting your pencil off the paper - but it does a pretty good job in that direction , and over a hundred years have shown that it is in fact the " correct " formalization of that idea .
U. Hang on , I think S. has a point here .
The definition of continuity is set up for the real numbers , so it hardly counts as an objection to the rational numbers that it gives strange results there .
How do you know there is n't a formal definition that works better for the rationals ?
M. Such as what ?
U. Well , the trouble we had with the jump at root two was that we were n't allowed to say what we all knew to be the case - that the function has a jump at root two .
We can look at a graph and this jump stares us in the face .
Could n't one identify this jump by saying that on one side the function is big and on the other side it is suddenly small ?
M. And what do you mean by suddenly ?
U. Something like that for any d > 0 there is a pair x , y such that |y - x| < d , and yet f( x ) =1 and f(y ) =0 .
So x and y are close , while f( x ) and f(y ) are not close .
S. I wanted to say something like that .
You can still have a jump even if there is n't actually a rational point where the jump occurs .
M. So what exactly is your definition ?
U. There seem to be many possibilities .
If we try to avoid focusing on a single point ( because the point we want to look at might be irrational ) then we could just say that f is continuous if for every e > 0 there exists d> 0 such that |f ( x ) - f(y ) |< e whenever |x -y| < d .
M. What you have given is indeed a rigorous definition , but it's of uniform continuity , which is subtly but importantly stronger than continuity itself .
U. So you 're saying that there are continuous functions that that definition would n't count as continuous ?
M. Yes , there are lots .
For example x2 defined on all the rationals .
U. Oh yes .
All right , here 's another definition using sequences .
One would like to say that f is continuous if f(x n ) tends to f(x ) whenever x n tends to x , but that runs into the usual problem that the x in question might not be rational .
But ca n't we just talk about sequences that ought to be " convergent " without talking about their limits ?
Our lecturer told us a good way of doing that the other day - talk about Cauchy sequences .
This seems to give a good definition of a sequence of rationals that is " convergent but not necessarily to a rational " .
So how about saying that f is continuous if it maps Cauchy sequences to Cauchy sequences ?
M. Does n't quite work .
For example , let f( x ) be defined to be 1/x on the set of all strictly positive rationals .
That 's continuous but the Cauchy sequence ( 1/n ) maps to the non-Cauchy sequence ( n ) .
U. Yes , but does n't it work at least for functions defined on all the rationals ?
Suppose f is the restriction to Q of a continuous function defined on R .
Then it maps convergent sequences to convergent sequences .
But convergent is equivalent to Cauchy so it maps Cauchy sequences to Cauchy sequences .
Conversely , if f maps Q to Q ( or even Q to R ) and takes Cauchy sequences to Cauchy sequences , then we can extend the definition to R as follows .
Given a real number x , take a sequence x n of rationals converging to x and then map x to the limit of f( x n ) .
This exists because it is a Cauchy sequence - which in turn follows from the fact that ( x n ) is Cauchy .
Also that value of f(x ) is well - defined or we'd be able to put two sequences together and contradict the property we 're assuming of f .
M. What you say is right , and works for functions defined on any closed interval of rational numbers .
But I do n't like it much because you 're basically sneaking the reals in through the back door .
After all , what is a real number if it is n't a Cauchy sequence of rationals ?
Going back to the function with a jump at root two , you are suggesting that we identify the so - called " discontinuity " by constructing a sequence of rationals that converges to root two and perhaps alternates between being bigger than root two and smaller , so that f of that sequence alternates between 0 and 1 .
Then you pretend that root two does n't exist and merely comment that your sequence is Cauchy .
But that just looks like an artificial way of not saying what is really going on .
S. Well I think that when you said f was continuous on the grounds that you were n't allowed to talk about the place where it jumped , you were artificially not saying what was going on .
U. Here 's another definition .
Given a nested sequence I n of closed intervals of rational numbers with lengths tending to zero , look at their images f ( I n ) .
For f to be continuous one would want the intersection of the f( I n ) to be either empty or a singleton .
M. I do n't like that for the same reason .
You 're just identifying a real number - the intersection of the I n - without admitting it .
S. If I may say so , there 's something very strange about your position .
You take the highly artificial and non-canonical step of defining a real number as an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rationals , or of suitable sequences of nested intervals , and then accuse us of being artificial when we do n't get excited by your definition .
Which is more artificial ?
To give a simple definition of continuity in terms of Cauchy sequences or to get so carried away that you start to believe that Cauchy sequences are real numbers ?
U. Anyway , what about going back to the first thing I said ?
I 've just remembered that all continuous functions are uniformly continuous when you restrict them to a bounded closed interval .
So why not define a function f from Q to Q to be continuous if its restriction to any bounded closed interval is uniformly continuous ?
I.e. , what I said before is fine as long as you look at finite pieces of Q .
And now I do n't see where I am implicitly talking about real numbers .
M. Hmm . I think you may be right .
OK , how would you define differentiability ?
U. Well , let 's look at a function that is , technically speaking , differentiable , but which " oughtn't " to be .
How about f( x ) = max { x2 - 2 , 0} ?
I want to say that this function f is n't really differentiable because it is n't approximately linear round root two .
To demonstrate this , I could easily construct a pair of rational sequences ( a n ) and ( b n ) tending to root two from below and above respectively in such a way that f( b n ) - f ( a n ) / ( b n - a n ) does n't converge .
But then you 'll probably tell me that I 'm implicitly talking about the reals when I introduce these sequences .
M. Yes indeed .
And if you try to copy the uniform - continuity idea you will run into the difficulty that not every differentiable function is uniformly differentiable , even on a closed bounded interval .
U. What does " uniformly differentiable " mean ?
M. Differentiable at x says that for every e> 0 there is a d> 0 such that for all y with |y - x |< d we have f(y ) =f( x ) +( y- x ) f'( x ) + c , where c is at most e|y - x| .
So to make it uniform , we can ask for d not to depend on x .
That is , for all e> 0 there exists a d> 0 such that for all x , y we have the inequality |f (y ) - f(x ) - ( y- x ) f ' ( x ) |< e|y - x | whenever |y - x |< d .
But this is n't a great definition because it 's equivalent to saying that ( f( x+h ) - f( x ) ) /h tends to f'(x ) uniformly as h tends to zero .
But if f is differentiable then the functions ( f( x+h ) - f( x ) ) / h are continuous , so f ' is continuous , and we see that uniformly differentiable functions are automatically continuously differentiable .
U. I do n't like the definition because it requires you to know in advance what the derivative f'(x ) is .
M. In that case , you could say something like this .
" Differentiable " means " locally approximately linear " .
What does that mean ?
Well , if f( x ) =u and f(y ) =v and z=ax + by for some a , b> 0 with a +b=1 then f( z ) ought to be close to au+bv , the value it would take if f were exactly linear .
So define f to be uniformly differentiable if for every e> 0 there exists a d> 0 such that whenever |y - x|< d and z=ax + by is a convex combination of x and y we have |f ( z ) - af ( x ) - bf(y ) |< e|z-x| .
U. That 's much nicer .
So what 's your example of a function that 's differentiable but not uniformly so ?
M. Any old sin ( 1 / x ) - ish thing will do .
Let 's take the old favourite f( x ) =x2 sin ( 1/ x ) away from 0 and f( 0 ) =0 .
That wiggles so much near the origin that it easily fails both the above definitions .
U. So are you suggesting that we need the theory of real numbers in order to be able to talk about the differentiability of silly functions like x2 sin ( 1 / x ) ?
Why not just talk about uniform or continuous differentiability instead ?
M. My feeling is that you would have to give up quite a lot if all your differentiable functions were required to be continuously differentiable .
But rather than explore that question I 'd prefer to go back to the intermediate value theorem , which in my view gives a much more compelling justification for the real numbers .
M. Let 's take stock a little .
Are we all agreed that the rationals on their own are a bit restrictive because there are plenty of useful numbers such as root two , e and pi that are irrational ?
U. and S. Yes .
M. All right .
Now if we examine why it is that we believe in these numbers we 'll find that there are certain methods we like to use to make new numbers , and if we then make the innocent - seeming assertion that these methods are actually valid , we 'll find that we are committed to the entire real number system .
S. As I said before , that sounds interesting - but I 'll believe it when I see it .
M. Well , it 's very simple .
Let 's take the square root of two for example .
What is it ?
It 's the ( positive ) number that squares to two .
And why are we confident that there is such a number ?
Because of a very useful theorem known as the intermediate value theorem .
S. You keep mentioning that .
Are you now going to tell me what it says ?
M. Perhaps U. would like to do that for us .
U. All right .
It says that if f is a continuous function , a< b are real numbers and f( a ) =u , f( b ) =v , then for any w between u and v there must be some c between a and b such that f( c ) =w .
In other words , if a continuous function f takes two values then it must take all the " intermediate " values between them as well .
More loosely , if you draw the graph of a continuous function and part of it is below some horizontal line and another part above it , then somewhere the graph actually crosses the line .
M. Thank you .
And a good example of that is the function f( x ) =x2 .
Since f( 1 ) =1 and f ( 2 ) =4 there must be some x between 1 and 2 such that f( x ) =2 .
S. That sounds reasonable , but why is the intermediate value theorem true ?
M. I 'm interested that you ask .
Most people think it looks too obvious to need a proof .
S. I agree that you can't get from one side of a line to the other without crossing it , but it seems to me to be a big step from that physical statement to one about the abstract realm of numbers .
And what worries me is that your argument is going to turn out to be circular .
If the intermediate value theorem is true only for the real numbers and not for smaller number systems , then how can you use it to justify the real numbers ?
You need the real numbers to justify it .
M. I happily plead guilty to that .
You are confusing two sorts of justification .
In order to prove the intermediate value theorem you need the real numbers .
In the other direction , I am using the intermediate value theorem to justify the real numbers in a different sense : it is an extremely useful theorem which we would have to do without if we did without the real numbers .
S. Maybe you 're right .
But it 's a disappointingly theoretical justification .
I 'd hoped for something more direct .
M. That 's because I have n't yet made another important point , which is that the intermediate value theorem is just a dressing up in fancy language of an idea that is very direct and natural .
Here 's another approach to the existence of the square root of two .
You just build up the decimal expansion 1.4142135 ... , taking in each place the largest number between 0 and 9 that does n't make the square bigger than 2 .
This defines an infinite decimal and that number is defined to be the square root of two .
Interestingly , this simple construction is very similar to running through one of the proofs of the intermediate value theorem , and when you try to justify the assertion that the resulting number squares to two , you find that you are relying on the continuity of x2 and effectively proving the intermediate value theorem for this special case .
This point is discussed more fully here and here .
S. Suppose I accept that .
Does it really commit me to the entire real number system , as you said earlier , or just to a few special extra numbers like root two , e and pi ?
M. To all of them : if t is any real number , then find a continuous function that has a unique zero at t and it commits you to t .
S. And why can you do that ?
M. It 's trivial : the function f( x ) =x-t will do , for example .
S. I can't believe you just said that .
Are you seriously using the function f( x ) =x-t to justify the existence of the number t?
M. All right , point taken .
I was being a little hasty .
Let 's go back to the discussion of root two .
The " naive " way of building it is to produce its decimal expansion .
When you talk about the real numbers more formally , you abstract from this procedure a general principle , known as the monotone - sequences axiom .
It says that if ( x n ) is an increasing sequence of real numbers and there is some z that is bigger than every x n , then the sequence converges to a limit x .
I wo n't define this precisely , but you can see it happening with the sequence 1 , 1.4 , 1.41 , 1.414 , 1.4142 , etc. , which converges to the square root of two .
This general principle is also very natural , and more basic than the intermediate value theorem .
It quite definitely commits you to the real number system , because it can be proved that any ordered field for which this axiom also holds must be isomorphic to the field of real numbers .
S. You 're blinding me with science a little bit , but if I understand you correctly , we can focus our attention entirely on the question of whether we should accept the monotone - sequences axiom .
M. Yes , because that axiom implies everything else about the reals .
S. I still feel uneasy .
Suppose now I take an infinite decimal and try to " justify " it .
Let 's take pi as an example .
I 'm sorry if I sound rude , but it seems as though what you are suggesting is the following absurd justification : consider the sequence 3 , 3.1 , 3.14 , 3.141 , 3.1415 , 3.14159 , 3.141592 , ... and , bingo , that justifies pi .
Well , I can see that we have there a procedure that can be applied to any infinite decimal , but it hardly counts as a justification for pi .
To justify pi I 'd want to say that it is fundamental for trigonometry , that there is a wonderful formula ei pi= - 1 , and so on .
M. It 's important to distinguish between justification of individual numbers and justification of a number system .
I am happy to admit that the vast majority of real numbers are absolutely useless .
But together they provide a number system that is generous enough to contain all the useful numbers .
Secondly , and more importantly , they provide a context in which the arguments we naturally use to justify the existence of those useful numbers are valid .
So if we ever want to define a new number by one of these arguments , we can .
We do n't have to try to predict in advance what numbers will be useful .
U. Can I chip in here ?
I understand what you are saying , and I 'm more or less convinced , but I can see possible grounds for objection .
What you are saying is roughly this : that when we define an irrational number we have to do a bit of analysis - for example , exhibit a sequence of rationals that converges to it , or a continuous function that has it as a unique root , or a definite integral that has it as its value .
It turns out that the first of these methods is always enough , and can even be done with monotone sequences .
And now you suddenly say that we should allow all bounded monotone sequences to have limits .
But perhaps there is a more restrictive axiom that would give us a much smaller set of numbers but still give us all the useful ones .
I think there is some force behind S.'s objection to the " silly " justification for pi .
For a typical , generic , completely unspecial real number , it is not easy to think of a sensible justification .
Could n't one say something like that all sensible bounded monotone sequences converge ?
M. You can try , but I predict that you wo n't find it easy .
U. I 'm not sure quite what I 'm saying , but I am worried that the real number system is n't really defined properly .
The picture you have tried to present to us is that we start with the rationals , discover that they are inadequate , introduce some new numbers , see how we did it , and then say that these methods produce the entire real number system .
M. That 's a reasonable summary .
U. To put it more formally , you have an infinitary operation , f(x 1 , x 2 x 3 , ...) =lim x n , defined for all bounded monotone sequences , and you are saying that the real numbers are the smallest possible system that contains the rationals and is closed under this operation .
M. Exactly .
U. That 's fine , if we are happy with the notion of a bounded monotone sequence .
M. Do you find something confusing about that notion ?
U. Yes , in a way .
I do n't know how to articulate what I 'm saying , but let me try .
Suppose x is a real number - and let 's think of it as a typical one , which means for example that it is undefinable .
Then x determines for us a bounded monotone sequence - just take its decimal expansion and look at longer and longer truncations .
Conversely , that bounded monotone sequence determines x - since x is its limit .
But all that seems to tell me is that x and the bounded monotone sequence are co-dependent - given one , I 've got the other .
But it gives me no clue about which pairs ( x , sequence converging to x ) exist .
M. Are you suggesting that there are such pairs that do n't exist ?
If so , then I do n't know what the words " there are " mean !
U. As I said before , I do n't know how to explain myself very well .
It just seems that in order to define the closure operation , you have to talk about an arbitrary bounded monotone sequence , and that notion is virtually equivalent to the notion of a real number .
So you end up with an apparent circularity .
And the effect of that circularity is that it is not really clear in what sense the vast majority of real numbers exist .
When you say " every bounded monotone sequence " I want to ask what bounded monotone sequences there are .
Why should I accept the notion of an arbitrary bounded monotone sequence ?
In fact , I really do n't think you have justified the real numbers at all - beyond the ones that can be defined in a nice explicit way .
S. Thank you .
That is what I was trying to say earlier .
M. We are getting into murky waters here .
There is something mysterious about the idea of an arbitrary infinite sequence - even when it just consists of zeros and ones .
And yet , a workable theory of real numbers seems to require us to accept that some of them are undefinable , for the simple reason that there are only countably many definitions and uncountably many real numbers .
That observation rules out what might otherwise be an attractive idea - to restrict attention to just the definable real numbers .
U. I 'm a bit confused about the idea that there are only countably many definable real numbers .
What if you put them in a list according to the alphabetical order of their definitions and then apply a diagonal argument ?
Does n't that give a new , and defined , number ?
M. I told you we were getting into murky waters .
Look here for a detailed discussion of that question .
But the short answer is that you have to make precise what you mean by a definition .
If you do , then you find that the diagonal number you construct is not definable in the way that the numbers in the list were .
It 's more like meta - definable .
U. But in that case , I do n't see why I can't just fix on a decent notion of definition and restrict attention to definable real numbers .
If you then try to persuade me that there are numbers I have left out , I 'll ask you to define one for me , and you wo n't be able to .
You 'll be able to meta - define one , but so what ?
Why should I worry about that ?
M. Because your set will be countable and all the theorems of analysis will become false .
U. But will that be a problem ?
The " theorems of analysis " you refer to concern objects I do n't like and do n't have an obvious use for , like " arbitrary " sequences .
I 'd still be able to do all the useful stuff would n't I ?
For example , the intermediate value theorem would be true for definable continuous functions , and I 'm not too worried about any others .
In fact , I could end up speaking exactly the same language as you , but mean something slightly different by the phrase " for all x " , which for me would mean " for all definable x " , whatever sort of object x might be .
In fact , I could even say that the reals were uncountable !
What I 'd mean by this in your terms is that there is no definable bijection between N and the definable reals , which there is n't because then I could apply a diagonal argument and define a real not in the image .
M. I 'm convinced that this is going to break down somewhere , but I 'm not quite sure where yet .
L. I 'm sorry to butt in , but I could n't help overhearing some of your conversation , and I think I may be able to deal with some of your questions .
M. Oh yes ?
L. Well , the most obvious thing to say is that U. is on the way to rediscovering so - called constructible set theory .
The details are more complicated than U. is making them , but the basic thought is sound : when we talk about the set of all subsets of an infinite set , it is not clear what we mean .
Most mathematicians just do n't worry about that , and accept a notion of " arbitrary sequence , whatever that might turn out to be " .
But a perfectly consistent ( at least if normal set theory is consistent ) set theory results if one interprets the power set operation as giving you all definable subsets of a given set .
U. How is that any different from what I was saying ?
L. The difference is that you are too resistant to what you called meta-definition .
At least as Godel set up constructible set theory , you build up sets one level at a time .
You have a collection of formulae you are allowed to use , and into them you can put any sets you have defined so far in order to define new ones .
Using Godel numbering , you can even do diagonalizations , but if you apply a diagonal argument to a collection of sets at level n then you get a set at level n+1 .
And that n does n't have to be a positive integer - it goes on up into the ordinals .
If you carry on building levels up to the first uncountable ordinal , then you finally get to show that there are uncountably many subsets of the natural numbers .
U. If you 're allowed such a flexible notion of " constructible " then who is to say that you have n't constructed all the subsets of the natural numbers ?
L. Not an easy question to answer .
The axiom V=L , which states that every set is constructible , is consistent with ZFC .
And that 's not particularly surprising , given that you can't construct a counterexample !
S. So a moral you could draw is that when most mathematicians talk about the real numbers , they do n't know what they are talking about .
L. That 's a rather blunt way of putting it .
I 'd prefer to say that they leave unspecified what they mean by the idea of an arbitrary subset of a set , because they do n't need to worry about it .
They have the axioms for a complete ordered field , and if you believe in the external reality of mathematical objects then you will have to say that those axioms are ambiguous , because the completeness axiom relies on the notion of an arbitrary sequence , which is not fully explained .
But if all you want from your axioms is a set of rules for when you are allowed to deduce one mathematical statement from another , then the axioms for a complete ordered field give this to you .
S. So the theory of real numbers is just a collection of meaningless formal manipulations ?
L. No , not meaningless .
Even if you do n't say exactly what objects the theorems of analysis , such as the intermediate value theorem , apply to , you do at least know that they apply to simple objects such as the function f( x ) =x2 .
If you want to try to do real numbers in a " minimal " way , proving exactly what you need for " ordinary " mathematics and no more , then you make life unnecessarily complicated because you have to worry about what is definable and so on .
It is much more sensible for most mathematicians just to leave the notion of an arbitrary subset a bit vague and reason in a formal way .
You may then have proved more than you needed to , but why not if that is actually simpler ?
M. So , finally , we arrive at the following justification for real numbers .
1 . We must go further than just the rationals .
2 . When we do so we introduce certain procedures that give us new numbers .
3 . Formalizing these , we end up with the monotone - sequences axiom , or something equivalent to it .
4 . This axiom is not as precise as it seems , since the notion of an arbitrary monotone sequence , even of rationals , is not precise .
5 . There is no need to make it precise , because we know how to reason in terms of arbitrary sequences .
6 . That allows us to define the real numbers we have a use for , even if it gives us a lot of junk as well .
7 . In fact , we do n't really know what junk it does give us , and it 's not even clear that it makes sense to ask .
AS THE economic gloom deepens , the last thing the typical boss will feel like doing right now is laughing .
So it is anyone 's guess what he or she will think of a new book that makes the case for humour in the workplace — and not just the gallows sort .
“ The Levity Effect ” , by Adrian Gostick and Scott Christopher , argues for lightening things up with such earnestness that it would pass for a spoof by the writers of “ The Office ” , a wonderful sitcom that revolves around a boss 's excruciatingly awkward attempts at jocular banter with the staff .
Indeed , one of the book 's “ 142 Ways to Have Fun at Work ” is to hold a “ marathon of ‘ The Office ' at the office .
Gather everyone to watch the best episodes of NBC's hit show during lunch for a week ” .
AP
An effective leader ?
The jargon is no joke : want to be a “ levity leader ” , anyone ?
Well , better that than a “ jaw clencher ” or a “ brow knitter ” .
And you have to wonder who the target reader is when the book 's conclusion contains advice such as “ start each day smiling in the mirror ” , “ smile at your family ” , “ go easy on the kids ” and even , er , “ smile at strangers ” .
Yet , as the authors point out , all this is justified because “ fun is a serious business ” .
There is , it turns out , a “ connection between the punchline and the bottom line . ”
Lighten things up at work and assuredly you will be — wait for it — “ laughing all the way to the bank ” .
No , seriously .
A remarkable amount of evidence supports the argument that levity pays : “ Fun at work , ” Messrs Gostick and Christopher explain , “ can provide a competitive advantage , help attract and retain employees , and provide the spark to jumpstart creativity . ”
A fun workplace improves communication and morale , raises the level of employee trust , lowers employee turnover and increases profits .
An organisation called the Great Place to Work Institute has consistently found that companies that are classified as “ great ” score unusually high marks from employees on the question “ Are you working in a fun environment ? ”
Great companies scored 81 % on this , compared to 62 % for companies ranked “ good ” .
A study by Ipsos found that employees who rate their managers ' sense of humour as “ above average ” rate the likelihood they will still be on the job in a year 's time at almost 90 % .
Those who rate their managers ' humour as “ average ” or “ below average ” rate their chances of staying at only 77.5 % .
The top ten fun companies include Google — perhaps inevitably , given that its Mountain View headquarters , the Googleplex , offers Googlers free food , scooters , volleyball courts , a toy dinosaur and a yellow brick road .
Starbucks also ranks ( though the survey was done before the coffee retailer 's recent troubles , including a lawsuit over who gets to keep the tips ) , as do the Container Store — a chain that sells , well , containers — and Nugget Market , a California grocery store .
Fun firms use a wide range of humour strategies .
Intuit has a “ fun committee ” that organises events such as potluck breakfasts and jeopardy games .
AstraZeneca has a “ fun department ” that brings “ funsters ” to the firm to sing , distribute toys and tell jokes .
Another firm , which lists “ fun ” among its core values , hands - out “ Walk the Talk ” awards , a set of wind - up chattering teeth presented by the chief executive accompanied by a kazoo band .
KPMG , an accounting firm , holds online contests for staff ( with great prizes ) , and gives away barbecue packs .
The authors are convinced that bosses can learn to be lighter - hearted without indulging in the fake friendliness of the boss in “ The Office ” .
Some of their suggestions might not go down well with the human resources department , however , such as “ take candid photos of employees during work and at company events .
Use them during internal PowerPoint presentations to liven things up .
Drop in a caption or two if you can . ”
As the saying goes : “ 1-800 - LAWSUIT ” .
Indeed , the deadening hand of HR ( or the publisher 's lawyers ) may have intervened in the section “ a few red flags ” , which warns against humour that involves kidding , mockery , sarcasm or anger .
And the same applies to the “ Time and Place Rule ” : “ The universally ignored law which dictates that before any workplace humour is executed , its bearer must determine , using reasonably sound judgment , if said humour is appropriate . ”
The best bet may be to hire people with a sense of humour .
That was the philosophy of Herb Kelleher , the legendary boss of Southwest Airlines , an airline that is actually a pleasure to fly .
One of his staff delivers one of the better and curiously timely lines in the book , “ We 're sorry for the delay , but our automated bag smasher is broken and we are having to break your bags by hand . ”
Oddly , the authors do not include your correspondent 's top tip for maintaining workplace levity : do n't ban your staff from using YouTube during office hours .
C# 3.0とは何か？
C#も順調にバージョンアップを重ね、つい に
「3.0」である。連載を開始するに当たり、前置きとしてこの連載で扱うC#
3.0とは何かを簡単に紹介しておこう。
C# 3.0は、動的かつタイプセーフなオブジェクト指向プログラミング言語である。「動的」とは、実行するまで内容が確定しない要素が多いことを意味し、「タイプセーフ」とは、あらゆるデータに「型」が存在し、コンパイル時、あるいは実行時にそれが厳格にチェックされることを意味する。そして「オブジェクト指向プログラミング言語」とは、データとプログラムの入れ物である「オブジェクト」を前提とした言語であることを示す。
しかし、これらの特徴はC# 2.0から継承されたものであって、必ずしもC#
3.0固有のものではない。C# 3.0ならではの特徴とは何だろう？
筆者の個人的な印象だが、C# 3.0は言語が持つ個々の機能について技術解説される機会はあれど、言語そのものについて語られる機会は少ないと感じている。例えば、「ほかの言語と比較してJavaは（あるいはRubyは）これほど素晴らしい」と語る文章をしばしば見掛ける。しかし、C#
3.0に関する文章は、個別技術の内容や使い方を淡々と語るものばかりで、ほかの言語と比較する文章や、素晴らしさをたたえる文章にはあまり遭遇しない感がある。
では、C# 3.0が使われていないのか……といえばそうではない。明らかにC#
3.0を使って日々大量のコードを生み出している人たちがいる。筆者もその1人である。
なぜ彼らが語らないのか、正確なところは当人たちに聞かないと分からないだろう。しかし、筆者が語らない理由は簡単に説明できる。技術者とは語る者ではなくコードを書く者であって、満足のいくコードさえ書ければそれだけで満足してぐっすり眠れる人種である。そして、C#
3.0によってストレスを残さず書きたいコードをすべて書き切れているのである（しかし、このような記事を書いて語ってしまっている理由も簡単である。ライターという人種は語る者だからである。筆者はライターでもあり、二足のわらじを履いている）。
このことは、以下のことを示唆する。
世の中には語りによって補強しなければ優秀さを説得できない言語と、コードを書くことを経由しなければ優秀さを納得できない言語がある
これは、C# 3.0の特徴を理解するには、言葉による説明ではなくコードを見ていかねばならないことを意味する。それも、短いサンプル・コードではなく、ある程度以上の規模を持った本格的なプログラムでなければならない（しかし残念ながら、このような連載記事で長いコードをお見せすることはできない。短いサンプル・コードで解説することをお許しいただきたい）。
では具体的にコードから伝わってくるC# 3.0の特徴とは何だろうか？
それは、あいまいさを一切排除した厳格な型の扱いを維持しつつ、徹底的に少ない文字数でコードを書けるようにしたことではないかと思う。
典型的な例は、今回の主題でもある「ラムダ式」だろう。ラムダ式が持つ機能性は、C#
2.0が持つ匿名メソッドと何ら変わることはない。変わったのは主に、より少ない文字数で書けるようになったことである。
また、C# 3.0の新機能である「暗黙的に型指定される変数」も同様に文字数を減らす効能がある。初期化する値によって型が明確であれば、変数宣言に、
SpecialHighReadabilityTypeName<AnotherHighReadabilityTypeName >
のような長い型の名前を書かずに、
var
と3文字書くだけで済ませられる（この新機能については次回以降で解説予定）。
しかし、コードが短くなることの効果は絶大である。まず当然のことながら、書くための手間が減る。Visual StudioのIntelliSense（インテリセンス）を併用しても、明らかにタイピング量が減る。（体力で押し切れる若いころはピンとこないかもしれないが）完全に同じ意図を記述するものであれば、タイピング量の差は生産量の差として明確な差が生じ得るものである。
そしてもっと素晴らしいのは、読むための手間が減ることである。1画面に表示できる文字数、目が受け取ることができる情報量に限りがある以上、同じ意図をより少ない文字で表現する方が、より多くの情報を受け取ることができる。それにより、コードを読むためにスクロールさせる頻度も減るし、コードを読むときに特に意味を持たない形式的なキーワードを排除して、意味のある部分を切り分ける手間も減る。
問題は、あいまいさがなく、より短い文字数で同じ意図を記述するために、まったく新しい構文が導入され、それを覚えねばならないことである。また、慣れない構文でいくら短く書けても、それでソース・コードが読みやすくなるわけではない。
しかし、そのことは大した問題とはならない。なぜなら、C#
3.0とはひたすらコードを書くことに奉仕する言語であり、C#
3.0プログラマーになるということは、大量のコードを無理なく生産する立場に立つことを意味するからだ。少数の目新しい構文など、大量のコードを書いているうちにすぐ慣れてしまうだろう。逆にいえば、コードを書き続けることによって、何かを成し遂げようとする者のための言語がC#
3.0であるともいえる。
C# 3.0の適用範囲
本論に入る前に重要な話を書いておく。
C# 3.0あるいは開発環境であ るVisual Studio 2008の適用範囲はどこまでか、である。つまり、何を対象に開発するときに、それらを使用できるのかである。
割とよくある誤解として、これらは.NET
Framework 3.5専用であり、.NET
Framework 2.0を対象に開発するときには依然としてVisual Studio 2005 とC# 2.0が必要だという認識が見られる。

The train was stuck in a tunnel at the time of the hoax
A drunk top civil servant , who said he was a Muslim with a bomb on London 's Tube , has been jailed for 12 months .
Northern Ireland - born Ministry of Justice official George McFaul had to be protected from angry commuters after the hoax .
The 43 - year - old told passengers they had just one minute to live before his rucksack device detonated .
McFaul , of Turner Road , Walthamstow , east London , had pleaded guilty to communicating false information .
" It is going to go off in 60 seconds , " he was said to have repeated .
London 's Southwark Crown Court also heard that one terrified woman traveller immediately pulled the emergency lever to alert the driver .
The Northern Line train , which had been stuck in a tunnel at the time because of signal problems , then started moving and pulled into King 's Cross station .
As the doors opened , all onboard fled , leaving the " occasional binge - drinker " still in his seat .
No danger
He was immediately surrounded by station staff , who took one look at the state he was in and decided there was no danger .
One of them then searched his rucksack , finding nothing more threatening than a paperback novel and a mobile phone .
Station supervisor Michael McKenna later told police the passengers , who were still on the platform , were " angry and I had to keep them apart from him " .
A question of nature , not nurture ?
An Edinburgh University study of identical and non-identical twins suggests genes may control half the personality traits keeping us happy .
The other half is linked to lifestyle , career and relationships .
However , another expert said despite the research in the journal Psychological Science , we can still train ourselves to be more content .
Together with life and liberty , the pursuit of happiness is a core human desire
Dr Alexander Weiss
University of Edinburgh
Psychologists have developed several methods to assess a person 's personality type - and even their level of happiness .
The Edinburgh study , in conjunction with researchers at the Institute for Medical Research in Queensland , Australia , looked at results from 900 pairs of twins .
The idea behind twin studies is that , because identical twins are genetically exactly the same , while fraternal twins are not , it is possible , by comparing the results from the two groups to calculate how strongly influenced a particular trait is by genetics .
In this case , the researchers looked for people who tended not to worry , and who were sociable and conscientious .
All three of these separate characteristics have been linked by other research to an overall sense of happiness or well - being .
The differences between the results from the identical and fraternal twins suggested that these traits were influenced up to 50 % by genetic factors .
Positive psychology
Dr Alexander Weiss , from Edinburgh 's School of Philosophy , Psychology and Language Sciences , who led the research , said : " Together with life and liberty , the pursuit of happiness is a core human desire .
" Although happiness is subject to a wide range of external influences we have found there is a heritable component of happiness which can be entirely explained by genetic architecture of personality . "
The science of happiness is a growing field , with demand from both the public and industry for insights into emotional wellbeing .
The Centre for Applied Positive Psychology promotes research into techniques for boosting personal contentment .
Dr Alex Linley , from the centre , said that even though other studies supported the genetic argument , it was wrong for anyone to think that nature had dealt them a fixed hand in happiness terms .
He said : " What it means is that , rather than a single point , people have a range of possible levels of happiness - and it is perfectly possible to influence this with techniques that are empirically proven to work .
" Simple things , like listing your strengths and using them in new ways every day , or keeping a journal where you write down , every night , three things that you are grateful for , have been shown to deliver improvements . "
Shannon Brownlee in the Post on drug companies inventing new diseases :
It turns out that much of what we — and our doctors — think we know about many health problems has been shaped by drugmakers and their marketers .
…
Osteoporosis and osteopenia are n’t really diseases .
Before the 1990s , doctors decided that you had osteoporosis if you were elderly and you broke a bone .
When the pharmaceutical company Merck came up with its anti-bone - loss durg Fosamax , it wanted a broader market than just elderly fracture patients .
The solution ?
The company helped fund a panel of medical experts to create diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis so that a diagnosis could be made before the patient actually broke a bone .
The panel ’s first step was to define " normal " bone density as that of the average 30 - year - old woman .
Next , the experts chose as their cutoff for osteoporosis a statistical point that was slightly below the bone density of their normal 30 - year - old — a definition they admitted was " somewhat arbitrary . "
Finally , they came up with a completely new disease — osteopenia — for bone density that fell somewhere between that normal 30 - year - old and their arbitrary definition of osteoporosis .
Voila — 30 percent of post - menopausal women suddenly had a disease that needed to be treated early in order to prevent a problem — hip fracture — that would n’t occur for many years , if ever .
According to the new guidelines , millions more women now had osteopenia , which their doctors needed to watch like hawks so that their patients could be treated once they progressed to osteoporosis .
Merck then took the added step of helping doctors buy DEXA scanners , X - ray machines needed to scan your bones to get that all - important diagnosis . …
Fosamax … can cause necrosis ( death ) of the jawbone .
What ’s more , there are n’t any valid scientific studies to show that treating osteoporosis early will prevent fractures down the road .
The drug can also trigger serious heartburn .
Many studies of education vouchers have looked at the achievement of children who are given vouchers and who transfer to private schools .
Generally these studies have found small but meaningful improvements ( e.g. here and here ) .
A voucher program , however , is about much more than transferring students from lousy public schools to better private schools it ’s about creating incentives to improve the public schools .
Florida ’s Opportunity Scholarship Program rated schools .
Students at schools that received an F in multiple years became eligible for a voucher that allowed them to attend a private or higher - rated public school .
In Feeling the Florida Heat ? ( ungated version ) a paper sponsored by the Urban Institute Rouse et al. look at what happened at failing schools .
…we find that schools that received a grade of “ F ” in summer 2002 immediately improved the test scores of the next cohort of students , and that these test score improvements were not transitory , but rather remained in the longer term .
We also find that “ F ” - graded schools engaged in systematically different changes in instructional policies and practices as a consequence of school accountability pressure , and that these policy changes may explain a significant share of the test score improvements ( in some subject areas ) associated with “ F ” - grade receipt .
Thus , this paper shows two things .
First , that the test scores of the students in the public schools improved when vouchers gave the schools better incentives to perform .
Second , at least some of the improvement comes from changes in how students are taught .
The author ’s note , for example :
…we find that schools receiving an “ F ” grade are more likely to focus on low - performing students , lengthen the amount of time devoted to instruction , adopt different ways to organize the day and learning environment of the students and teachers , increase resources available to teachers …
It is not true that " nothing can be done to improve the schools . "
Incentives matter .
Notice that Florida ’s program worked even though the program was very weak .
It offered vouchers only to students in the worst schools and only after those schools received F grades in multiple years .
The vouchers were relatively small and could not be topped up .
In addition , the program lasted only a few years before it was declared unconstitutional by Florida ’s supreme court .
A true voucher program would be national , would not discriminate among students , would offer funding equal to that spent on students in public schools and would be permanent .
Competition in such a system would be more intense and even more productive than in Florida ’s program .

Some 37 percent of respondents to the poll , conducted by the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority in Virginia , said they would rank spending to raise energy efficiency and develop alternative fuel technology a top priority for future investment .
That compares with 30 percent who ranked more cash for medical breakthroughs as most important .
“ I think it ’s a combination of things like high gas prices and the need for alternative fuels , but also things that are emotional like greenhouse effects , global warming and the need for reducing carbon emissions , ” said Gerald Gordon , chief executive of the FCEDA .
The survey results come as U.S. gasoline prices continue to rocket to new highs , with average retail prices hitting a record $ 3.29 a gallon on Monday , according to the federal Energy Information Administration .
Men were more likely to choose fuel efficiency as their highest priority , with 43 percent placing it on top compared with only 30 percent of women , the FCEDA survey showed .
Women were more likely to pick medical technology as a priority , with 33 percent pegging it as a top investment , compared with 26 percent of men .
A next iteration of the survey will break down priorities in fuel and medical breakthroughs , Gordon said .
“ When they say alternative fuels and energy , are they talking about energy or things like greenhouse effect -- what ’s really on people ’s minds ? ” he said .
The environment placed third in the survey , with 14 percent of respondents tagging it as the most important area for greater investment , while defense spending took 10 percent of the vote .
Britons , however , ranked healthcare breakthroughs as the top priority ( 38 percent ) over fuel efficiency and alternative fuels ( 33 percent ) , according to a parallel study by FCEDA in Great Britain .
The U.S. FCEDA study , which had a 4 percent margin of error and 95 percent confidence level , was based on telephone interviews with 692 adults from March 7 - 9 , 2008 .
Bush backing down in FISA fight ?
Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday April 1 , 2008

Print This Email This After months of using politically loaded rhetoric and hyping " bogus " terror threats to push Congress to give him the domestic spying bill he 's demanding , President Bush seems to be backing down .
The Wall Street Journal reports Tuesday that the White House is softening its hard - line approach to updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
The steps toward moderation and compromise come as House Democrats proved last month that they have enough votes to pass a FISA bill that includes more oversight of surveillance efforts within the US than Bush would like and also to block the immunity he has demanded for telecommunications companies that facilitated his warrantless wiretapping program .
Over the two - week spring recess , administration officials contacted Democratic leaders to suggest they were open to compromise on updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
" We definitely want to get it done , " said White House spokesman Tony Fratto .
" We've had some initial conversations with Congress about the need to get FISA reform done quickly . "
He added that Mr. Bush still prefers the Senate measure , which the White House negotiated with Senate Democrats .
In addition to rejecting immunity for companies , House Democrats want tougher judicial oversight of any eavesdropping effort .
People familiar with the matter said the White House has floated ideas to find common ground but has n't offered a formal compromise proposal .
Officials in both parties said judicial oversight might be an easier area for the administration to make concessions .
In brief remarks Monday , Bush continued to push for action on the FISA bill .
But he declined to invoke one of the GOP 's favorite bogey men and backed away from previous accusations that Democrats were in the pocket of " trial lawyers " in failing to pass a long - term FISA update .
While the White House is striking a " more conciliatory posture , " as the Journal says , recognizing their waning clout on national security issues , it remains unclear just what -- if anything -- of substance will come from the reported negotiations between the Bush administration and Congress .
Just before leaving for a two - week recess last month the House narrowly passed a FISA update that included additional oversight Democrats said was needed to protect Americans ' constitutional rights ; the House bill also did not include a telecom immunity provision .
Bush has said it would be unfair to not to grant immunity to phone an internet companies that assisted his wireless surveillance ; those companies , such as AT&T and Verizon , are defendants in nearly 40 pending lawsuits alleging they illegally violated customers ' privacy .
Prior to the House bill 's passage , the White House and its GOP allies in Congress boycotted negotiations over how to update FISA .
As recently as Monday , National Journal 's subscription - only CongressDaily reported there were no serious discussion between Democrats and Republicans during the two weeks Congress was out of session , before returning Tuesday .
GOP and Democratic aides in the House and Senate said no substantive negotiations occurred during the recess to broker a compromise .
Instead , Senate and House Democrats might be looking to try to come to an agreement between themselves without input from Republicans and the Bush administration , aides said .
Senate GOP aides say the House bill contains provisions similar to ones rejected by the Senate , and that would impede the nation 's intelligence agencies .
They say the House needs to pass legislation Bush would sign into law .
Whatever the case , the changed mood seems to have heightened Democratic spirits , although plenty of details remain to be worked out .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - MD ) told reporters Tuesday the White House is now in a position where they want to talk about a possible compromise ,  according to Roll Call ( subscription only ) .
He credited Bush 's new willingness to talk to the House 's ability to pass its own FISA bill .
 I think , frankly , they were surprised ,  he observed .
Security remains tight in Tibet and surrounding regions
Several policemen were also injured in the clash in the western Sichuan province , Xinhua news agency reported .
The Tibetan government - in - exile says that 130 people died in and around the Himalayan region during clashes that began on 10 March .
Officials in Beijing have previously put the death toll at 19 .
Neither of the figures can be independently verified .
Foreign journalists remain banned from Tibet .
In a separate development on Monday , pro-Tibet activists briefly disrupted a flame - lighting ceremony in Greece for the Olympic Games in Beijing this summer .
Protesters from media rights group Reporters Without Borders broke through the cordon of 1,000 police officers in Olympia as China 's envoy spoke .
Differing accounts
Xinhua said one Chinese policeman was killed and several others were injured during the riots on Monday in Sichuan 's Gaze prefecture .

It did not provide any further details .
Separately , local authorities in Sichuan said 381 people involved in earlier protests in Aba county had given themselves up .
Chinese and Tibetan sources have given very different accounts of the protests , which were started by Buddhist monks on the anniversary of a Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule .
Chinese authorities have blamed the Dalai Lama for orchestrating the unrest , in an attempt to sabotage the Beijing Olympics and promote Tibetan independence .
But the Tibetan government - in - exile , based in Dharamsala , northern India , says innocent civilians were killed by Chinese troops .
China 's state media has recently attacked foreign news coverage of the unrest , claiming it is unfair .
The official People 's Daily newspaper said foreign journalists had misrepresented government efforts to restore order as a military crackdown .

Regardless of your personal opinion of Björk ( she usually fits pretty snugly into the “ love her or hate her ” category ) she easily produces the most artistic , ground - breaking , and visually stunning music videos in her industry .
She sets the bar for imagination , hands down .
Buzz has been building around her latest vid , “ Wanderlust ” , since production stills made it on the web a couple months ago .
Now the wait is over .
Björk came out in person for the first screening at Deitch Studios in Long Island City on March 13 .
The video was ( finally ) released for the rest of us today on Yahoo .
Directed by duo Encyclopedia Pictura , this little wonder was shot in 3D with a mix of live action , puppets , scale models , and computer generated animation .
The result is unlike anything you ’ve ever seen before .
Like it or not , whether you think she ’s bat shit crazy or not , Björk is a consummate artist .
And you gotta give her respect for that .
The low quality YouTube version of the video simply does n’t do it justice , and those links are being killed now anyway .
Luckily , I got an email from Isaiah at Encyclopedia Pictura with this high - res link .
It is beautiful .

If you want to see just how one goes about making a plastersine yak , then there ’s also a totally interesting behind the scenes spot as well :
COLOMBO ( Reuters ) - A suspected Tamil Tiger suicide bomber killed Sri Lanka ’s highways minister and at least 11 others on Sunday gathered for a marathon race near the capital , the government said .
“ Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle is dead from the explosion , ” Laksman Hulugalla , director general of the media centre for national security , told Reuters .
A former top Sri Lankan marathon runner , K.A Karunarathne , was among those killed while 100 people , some of them participants in the race to mark the upcoming New Year , were wounded .
The attack comes amidst an offensive launched by the Sri Lankan military on the northern strongholds of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in which at least 100 rebel fighters were killed last week , the military said .
The rebels have in the past hit back with bombings in the capital , Colombo , and in the relatively peaceful south of the war - ravaged island when they have come under military pressure in the north and east .
Sunday ’s attack took place in the town of Weliveriya , 30 km ( 19 miles ) from Colombo , where Fernandopulle had gone to flag off the marathon race .
Television footage showed a ball of fire moving towards the minister as he signalled the start of the run .
“ Its a suicide attack , definitely by the LTTE , ” said a bomb squad official , speaking on condition of anonymity from the scene .
President Mahinda Rajapaksa condemned the killing , blaming it on the LTTE , but said it would not weaken his government ’s resolve to put down terrorism .
“ The assassination of such a committed democrat once again shows the total contempt of the LTTE to the democratic process , and its unquestioned commitment to violence and terror to achieve it narrow and limited objectives , that are far removed from the interests of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka , ” he said in a statement .
“ While calling on the people to be calm and collected in the face of such extreme provocation by the forces of terror , I wish to reiterate that this dastardly act will not weaken our resolve to eradicate terrorism from our midst .
The LTTE , which usually denies any involvement in such attacks , was not immediately available for comment .

SECOND KILLING
Fernandopulle , 55 , was a member of the government negotiating team for failed peace talks with the Tamil Tiger rebels two years ago .
He was the second minister to be killed since January , when the minister for nation building , D.M. Dassanayake , died in a roadside blast in the same district , Gampaha .
Foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar was the most senior government leader to be killed in recent years , shot dead at his home in Colombo by a suspected Tamil Tiger sniper in August 2005 .
The Tigers are fighting for an independent state in the north and east of the island in a 25 - year civil war that has killed an estimated 70,000 people .
In January the government called off a tattered 2002 ceasefire , accusing the rebels of using it to regroup and re-arm , and vowed to fight them militarily .
Analysts say the military has the upper hand in the latest phase of the long - running war given superior air power , strength of numbers and swathes of terrain captured in the island ’s east .
But they still see no clear winner on the horizon .
The Rec.humor.funny Ban
It all started in late 1988 .
rec.humor.funny had been running for around 17 months , and was doing very well .
I had set up a system so that I could deposit accepted jokes into a queue directory , and once or twice a day , the computer would automatically select a random joke from the directory and post it to the net .
On November 9 , 1988 , the computer picked the following joke to post
The joke that made RHF infamous brian@radio.uucp ( Brian Glendenning )
Radio Astronomy , University of Toronto
( rec.humor , rec_humor_cull , racist ( mildly ) , chuckle ) ( Relayed From prabhu@mitisft ) A Scotsman and a Jew went to a restaurant .
After a hearty meal , the waitress came by with the inevitable check .
To the amazement of all , the Scotsman was heard to say , " I 'll pay it ! " and he actually did .
The next morning 's newspaper carried the news item : " JEWISH VENTRILOQUIST FOUND MURDERED IN BLIND ALLEY . "
Now this joke has some mildly racist overtones , and so I made a minor mistake in forgetting to follow my usual policy on such jokes , namely to encode the joke in what is known as rot13 encoding .
Our policy here has always been to not judge jokes based on their politics , only on their comedy .
This means that jokes like the above can make the cut .
The bad news was that November 9 , 1988 was the 50th anniversary of Krystallnacht , the horrible night when the Nazis burned and smashed the property and temples of German Jews , considered by some to be the start of the worst of the holocaust .
This coincidence of dates proved to be too much for Jonathan E. D. Richmond , a graduate student at M.I.T. at the time .
Richmond took serious offence and started a campaign against me on the net .
That sort of thing ( an offended person starting a posting campaign against something that offended them ) happens all the time on the net , and by and large most people were n't offended at all .
He called for me to be " replaced " as moderator , or barred from the net .
He did n't realize that those things do n't happen on the net , that it 's an anarchy , and each person who builds something gets to run it and has no boss who can replace him or her .
Richmond was disturbed to find that just 4 other posters agreed with him .
Just about everybody else laughed at his efforts -- or generally disagreed with the idea of anybody being censored for a politically incorrect joke or other posting .
During the debate , in fact , a far nastier joke indirectly critical of Richmond appeared that ended up getting me in a bunch of trouble .
Usually , when would - be banners get derided , they go away , but Richmond was not to falter .
First he called my company , hoping to get me fired .
I do wish I had had the quickness to realize this and pretended to be my boss , so that I could assure Richmond that I would be fired , but alas I just told him that I owned the company .
He hunted around for a while and eventually called the Kitchener - Waterloo Record , the 85,000 circulation daily newspaper in the town in which I was living .
At the Record , he found Louisa D'Amato , an Italian - Jewish reporter who was quite sympathetic to his complaint .
I gave D'Amato a nice interview on the matter , since she pretended to be sympathetic to my view when she called me .
( I 've learned since then ...)
Back in 1988 , " Internet " was a new word and much of USENET flowed over plain old modem links via a protocol called UUCP .
Usually one big site in a town would make the long distance call to bring in the news , and send out the few local articles that were generated , and other sites would talk to that site with local calls .
So it was with my site and the University of Waterloo ( my alma mater ) , which acted as hub for the area .
Richmond convinced D'Amato to write a very negative story on the idea of a joke forum where politically incorrect jokes could and did appear , and in particular on the idea that the University , acting as an ordinary USENET hub ( like thousands of other universities around the world at the time ) was facilitating all this .
The story she wrote appeared on the front page of the paper on December 1 , 1988 .
I got permission from the Record to post it to the net .
Reaction
This story surprised me , and upped the stakes .
Over the next week , stories appeared almost every day , either on the front page or on the front page of the local section .
The citizens of the town actually took no notice of it , and in spite of D'Amato 's thought that they would , but the University did .
It had to be seen to act , or felt it did .
It shut off my link , and said I could have it back if I agreed not to send jokes that were offensive or " in bad taste . "
I said I would , and asked for the University 's official guide to taste , but they never provided it .
The moment the word got out I had been banned from the University 's computers , at least a dozen sites offered to call me directly to allow the feed of rec.humor .
funny to go out to the world .
So it was never off the air .
In the meantime , I decided to have fun with the University .
I still did a feed to them , as well as the uncensored feed to the real world .
But for the U's feed , any joke that was even mildly offensive was replaced with a message that had the same headers and title , but the body was replaced by a notice stating that the University had asked that jokes in bad taste not be sent to it .
Sort of like the South African newspapers with the blank spots where censored stories used to be .
The rest of the world also covered the event , and Richmond also talked to reporters at his local Boston Herald .
Whoops .
They did a page 2 story on it which was n't all that kind to Richmond .
I can only assume that he realized the press was a dangerous tool .
Getting me banned had not made him a popular figure at MIT or on the net , and he got hassled apparently as he walked around the campus , though nothing physical was done .
At any rate , he never talked to the press again after that .
While stories were also done in the Toronto papers , it was odd that nobody noted the original joke was submitted by somebody at the University of Toronto .
I got pretty scared by the press over - attention , and did the smart thing and declined to talk to reporters .
Since then I have never had anything but sympathy for those people whom Mike Wallace says , in a dour and critical voice , " refused to talk to 60 minutes . "
The ban was in place , and hundreds of letters were written to the K - W Record ( more than they got on any other issue that year -- that 's the power of the net , even then ) and to the University , but it seemed it was all settling down .
I only got one letter from the general public in this case .
A big packet of apparently hand - typed - for - me notes from a Nazi living in Sarnia , Ontario .
Not a neo - Nazi , but an " I fought for the Fuhrer in the war " Nazi , saying how great it was that people were telling Jewish jokes on the computer .
One of the scariest things I ever got .
Good thing , I guess , that D'Amato failed to mention one minor detail in her story about me as leader of the network of anti-semitic computer nazis .
I'm Jewish enough myself that had I lived there , Hitler might have put me and my family in the camps .
Of course , other than providing a harrowing week , being banned was great for business .
I had just released the first jokebook based on rec.humor.funny , and had put " Banned at the University of Waterloo " stickers on them .
I 'm sure I sold a lot more books due to the ban .
And rec.humor.funny quickly surged to become the most widely read thing on the net .
That fame helped me start ClariNet , the largest circulation electronic newspaper on the Internet .
Today our number of paying subscribers is more than 14 times that of the Kitchener - Waterloo Record .
This is a lesson for those who want to ban things -- in the end you only help the people you want to ban .
Is it over yet ?
Early in 1989 , when we thought the story was long gone , June Genis , a programmer at Stanford University , noted to her boss in passing that there had been this silly flap over politically incorrect jokes in rec.humor.
funny .
June 's a libertarian , about as much against censorship as you can get , so she was shocked when her boss , hearing that another University had banned the group , decided that Stanford should ban it as well .
So they did , shutting off the group entirely .
They argued that since rec.humor.
funny was moderated , there was no place to complain .
The kept the unmoderated rec.humor because people could counter the jokes there .
To this day nobody understood that logic or knows the real reason for the ban , but Stanford students and faculty got up in arms over the idea of the computer center deciding what was fit to read and what was n't .
This time the press coverage was all anti-ban .
Stanford 's a bit more famous than the U. of Waterloo , so we saw stories and editorials in not just the major dailies of the S.F.
Bay Area , but also in magazines like Fortune ( see the Keeping Up column in the 1989 Fortune 500 issue ) , the New Scientist , Communications of the A.C.M. and others .
Stanford 's administration found themselves looking like fools .
John McCarthy , better known to many as the originator of the LISP computer language , called me up to say he would be leading the fight at Stanford to reverse the ban .
Pressure by him and others caused the faculty senate to have the matter referred to the library committee .
Anybody knows what a library committee is going to say about administrative bans of unpopular material .
They reversed the ban , though it took a few months .
Stanford also at the time was having some controversy over other censorious policies , such as a " fighting words " doctrine and several others .
These were also later overturned in a victory for academic freedom .
I 'm proud to have played a small part in helping this victory .
Waterloo , years later .
During the later years , UW played with banning other groups as well .
So did other schools .
A popular target are the alt.sex groups , and when they banned those it finally got the swell of popular opinion against group banning .
John McCarthy also came up to give a talk in support of the anti-ban efforts .
In late 1991 , UW finally reversed the ban , much to my personal satisfaction , even though I left the city of Waterloo that year .
Lessons and Conclusions
It should be noted that I never challenged the right of UW or Stanford to ban my publication .
As private institutions , they have the legal right to decide what is done with their computers .
I , and many others , however , argued that it was a violation of the strong principles of academic freedom .
A University , we feel , should not attempt to protect its students , and certainly not its faculty , from the offensive forms of expression in the real world .
In fact , even if you wanted to argue that some things should be banned out in the world at large , Universities have a special history of being the exception .
It 's sad that this has changed at some schools these days , and many people have vowed to continue to fight it .
Other notes Racism is a nasty accusation .
If you 're accused of it , do n't even bother answering , you can't give the right answer .
Avoid talking to the press , even if you are innocent , unless you really know what you are doing .
On the other hand , being banned can do wonders for your visibility if the people who really count know you and know the truth .
It can make you a lot of money .
Censors will never win .
As my friend John Gilmore has often been quoted as saying , " the net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it . "
That 's an apt description of what happened both places it was banned , with tons of new paths being used to get the same data .

Liquid Armor In Two Flavors : Shear Thickening and Magnetorheological
Liquid armor using shear thickening fluid ( STF ) is being developed at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Grounds .
The STF referred to in this article is made up of hard silica particles suspended in polyethylene glycol , a non -toxic fluid .
Kevlar fiber vests soaked with STF are pliable under normal conditions : " During normal handling , the [ fluid ] is very deformable and flows like a liquid .
However , once a bullet or frag hits the vest , it transitions to a rigid material , which prevents the projectile from penetrating the Soldier 's body , " said Dr. Eric Wetzel , a mechanical engineer from the Weapons and Materials Research Directorate who heads the project team .
( From Army Creates Liquid Armor ) Liquid armor could be used in bomb blankets , and even jump boots , which could be made to stiffen upon impact to support the ankle .
" Shear thickening " fluids ( also called " dilatant " fluids ) have unusual ( that is , non-Newtonian ) behavior in response to a shearing force .
Their viscosities increase or decrease as the applied shearing stress changes .
Cornstarch and water form a shear thickening fluid ; when poked hard with a finger , the mixture reacts as a solid .
However , if you place a " cube " of it on a table , it slowly flows into a puddle .
Not to be outdone , MIT has been working on a form of liquid armor that uses a class of fluids called magnetorheological fluids .
They are made up of nanoparticles of iron in a thick oil or syrup suspension .
When a magnetic field is applied , the iron particles align and the fluid becomes extremely stiff .
The degree of stiffness varies depending on the strength of the field applied .
It would be possible to wear comfortable , flexible armor that would become rigid at the flick of a switch .

Terminal Reality has said that the new Ghostbusters game will run at the same performance level on PS3 and Xbox 360 .
Confirmation came at last week 's Sierra showcase event , where Ghostbusters was up and running on both Sony and Microsoft 's machines .
" We 're demoing on both systems so you can see the game is fully running on both systems at the same performance level , " said executive producer Brendan Goss .
However , there will be some differences under the bonnet .
" Something unique for the PS3 is the displacement mapping , " said Goss , demoing a scene where a Ghostbuster is walking down a cobbled alleyway .
" The ground you 're looking at is only two polygons , it 's a completely flat plane .
We get the illusion of the 3D brick surface because of the relief map . "
Well there you go .
Ghostbusters is out on PC , PS2 , PS3 , Xbox 360 , Wii and DS this autumn .
Clinton last month doled out $ 15 million to a cadre of trusted political hands , mostly based in Washington .
Consultant spending saps Clinton campaign
Hillary Rodham Clinton started the year flush with cash , but by the beginning of this month , she 'd blazed through most of it — spending $ 11 million on ads , $ 3.8 million on messaging guru Mark Penn and $ 1,300 at Dunkin ' Donuts , to name just a few expenditures — leaving her campaign woefully unprepared for an extended battle for the Democratic presidential nomination .
About $ 15 million — or more than half of the New York senator ’s January spending — went to a cadre of high - priced consultants .
Though much of the cash went through the campaign media buyer for ad time , the considerable payments to outside consultants mark an increase in a pattern that has irked campaign insiders .
From the beginning of the race through the end of last month , Clinton paid the consultants $ 33 million — nearly one - third of the $ 105 million spent by the campaign .

That provides some of the back story behind Clinton ’s staff shake - up , her public appeals for campaign cash in the past two weeks and even her string of 10 straight losses to Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama since Super Tuesday , Feb . 5 .
She simply did not have the cash to compete in the post - Feb .
5 states , mostly because her campaign spending blueprint was built around two flawed premises : that no one would be able to match her fundraising and that the nomination would be decided on Super Tuesday .
Clinton ’s January campaign finances , filed Wednesday night with the Federal Election Commission , show she spent nearly as much as Obama from the beginning of the campaign until the beginning of this month .
But they also show a top - heavy campaign lacking the liquidity to adjust to the new electoral landscape that emerged after Feb .
5 .
Clinton last month doled out $ 15 million to a cadre of trusted political hands , mostly based in Washington , for everything from producing and placing ads to polling and fundraising and mailings .
Last month ’s payments marked a spike in fees collected by those professionals , all working as outside consultants rather than staffers .
The January payments to Penn ’s polling firm brought its total haul from the campaign to $ 8 million .
That does n’t include the $ 2 million the campaign owed the company at the end of January or the $ 125,000 it paid to the fundraising consultancy run by Penn 's wife , Nancy Jacobson .
Mandy Grunwald , Clinton ’s ad maker , pulled down $ 762,000 in January , bringing to $ 2.3 million her total from the campaign , not including the $ 240,000 she ’s owed .
The firm that places the campaign ’s ads on the air , Denver - based Media Strategies & Research , run by former Clinton Senate campaign staffer Jon Hutchens , in January was paid $ 10 million , bringing its tally for the campaign to $ 22 million .
Much of that money likely went to television stations to buy air time , but the firm got a cut too .
And the firm of Howard Wolfson , Clinton ’s top PR guy , was paid $ 267,000 last month , bringing its total to $ 688,000 from the campaign , plus the $ 16,000 the campaign is in debt to the firm .
Those payments , and others to top consultants , have prompted grumbling by campaign insiders who believe some of the cash flowing to Clinton ’s Washington - area brain trust could be better spent elsewhere , given the cash pinch that kept the campaign from matching Obama ’s investment in recent states .
Take advertising .
Headed into Tuesday ’s Wisconsin primary , in which Obama scored a decisive double - digit win , his campaign outspent Clinton ’s $ 414,000 to $ 117,000 on ads in the Milwaukee media market , which reaches about 45 percent of the primary electorate , according to an analysis by the Milwaukee Journal - Sentinel .
“ Since Feb . 5 , we have been outspent significantly in many states , ” Wolfson told reporters in a Wednesday conference call .
It ’s clear , he said , “ that that had something to do with some of the outcomes in these states . ”
The campaign ’s fundraising has picked up dramatically since Clinton added an unusual riff to her stump speech about loaning her campaign $ 5 million to get it through a rough patch .
And Wolfson boasted of a $ 15 million haul during the first half of February .
But Obama nearly lapped Clinton twice in January fundraising , pulling in $ 36 million to her $ 14 million .
And he still appears to be raking in cash at an equal or greater clip than Clinton .
Wolfson has acknowledged that continued brisk fundraising is “ very , very important to this campaign for the trajectory of this race . ”
Wolfson said he did not know how consultants ' fees were structured or whether any have taken cuts or would defer or reduce compensation in February to free up cash .
The campaign acted quickly this month to tamp down rumors staff had taken a pay cut .
But it has n’t been eager to discuss compensation and has worked to prevent internal workings of the campaign from becoming public .
" The salary and fee structures on the campaign are consistent with industry standards , " said Clinton spokesman Jay Carson .
Patti Solis Doyle , who oversaw campaign operations and spending as Clinton ’s top staffer , stepped down as campaign manager this month in the early stages of the campaign ’s 10 - contest losing streak .
She had been criticized for unchecked spending when she managed Clinton ’s 2006 Senate reelection campaign .
But the presidential campaign , which had paid her $ 156,000 , insisted the switch was n’t a reflection of disagreement about the direction of the campaign .
And Wolfson ’s compensation package — much speculated about within the campaign — was one of the issues probed by Josh Green for a GQ story that was spiked last summer when Clinton aides threatened to withhold access to Bill Clinton for a planned cover story .
It ’s sometimes tough to tell how much money political consultants actually take home , since campaigns often couple payments with the costs of ad production , air time or polling .
It ’s also difficult to do an apples - to - apples comparison of different campaigns ’ spending , because two campaigns can list the same expenses under different categories .
It is clear that — thanks to the $ 5 million Clinton loaned her campaign and the $ 10 million she transferred from her Senate campaign — her spending from the beginning of the campaign through January fell only $ 8 million short of Obama ’s $ 113 million outlay .
But through the beginning of this month , he spent $ 10 million more than Clinton on “ media , ” which was mostly for air time : $ 35 million , compared with her $ 25 million .
On a break from college , Wade Davis , age 20 at the time , crossed the Darién Gap — the roadless , desolate , and dangerous 100 - mile stretch of swamp that divides Central from South America .
He was clueless , compassless , and on foot .
And yet somehow he was chosen to be his group ’s guide .
His swagger certainly helped .
At 26 ( and still alive ) , Davis entered graduate school under Harvard University ’s legendary Richard Evans Schultes in the field of ethnobotany , where he learned to search for new medicines from the plants that indigenous peoples use .
But merely cataloging plants was not his style , so he applied for a doctoral dissertation grant to discover the recipe for zombie poison in Haiti .
He got the grant — along with a note from the academic reviewers that said , “ Davis must be told he will be killed if he tries to do this work . ”
In Haiti the swagger helped again .
He won the locals ’ trust by drinking unidentified potions in a sorcerer ’s hut , winning impromptu horse races , and weaving luminous stories of that improbable land called Canada .
He became probably the only white man ever to be initiated into Haiti ’s secret societies .
And he got the recipe for zombie poison — part graveyard - snatched human bone , part buried toad , part toxic puffer fish , and more parts magic than an outsider had ever been willing to see .
His success brought instant fame .
Davis stepped off the Haitian coast directly into a deal for what would become a best - selling book about voodoo culture , The Serpent and the Rainbow .
Then he sold the movie rights , earning more money and becoming better known than the professors judging his work .
Ethnobotany ’s rock star returned to Harvard and got his Ph.D. , but he turned away from academia just the same .
“ My forte was as a storyteller , grounded in the kind of training that I had in the academic world , ” he explains today .
In fact , for Davis botany was “ a metaphor , a conduit to culture ” itself .
With the language of plants offering entrée to the people he found fascinating , he took off with rain forest nomads and wrote another book ; he traveled with Inuit in the Arctic and wrote yet another .
In the course of his travels , he coined the term ethnosphere to describe the cultural web that encompasses the diverse dreams , myths , thoughts , products , and intuition of every culture on earth .
Preserving that diversity is what Davis desires most .
“ Half the languages of the world are disappearing in this generation , ” he says .
Davis does not consider preservation to be his job , however .
“ I ’m not in the business of trying to save the Peruvian Indian farmer any more than he ’s in the business of trying to save me , ” he says .
Instead , his goal is taking the rest of us to realms of cultural splendor so great that we will understand , finally , their value to the world .
Toward that end he works full - time as explorer - in - residence for the National Geographic Society , holding perhaps the only job - with - benefits on par with astronaut for pure adventure and thrill .
As a professional explorer , Davis travels the ethnosphere so he can discover and describe it in a stream of moving and popular exhibits , books , and films .
His award - winning two - hour special for the History Channel ,
Peyote to LSD : A Psychedelic Odyssey
, airs April 20 , and the IMAX film Grand Canyon Adventure , made in collaboration with environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , premiered in March .
DISCOVER met with Davis in his Washington , D.C. , home among the artifacts of his eclectic life : a tool for skinning the eyelids of wolves , a compound microscope , an upright piano , and an ornate wooden mask , carved in his likeness by an old Kwakiutl friend , who told him , “ That ’s your lips in old age , because you never shut up . ”
When did you start exploring ?
I was at Harvard in 1974 , and Harvard was very intense in those days .
I got there and I got very radicalized within about three days over the Vietnam War , so I spent most of my first year writing pamphlets and smashing windows , basically , and demonstrating .
Then after a couple of years I was exhausted , and I was just gonna take some time off .
I was with my roommate , David , who was from a Montana ranch family .
And we ’re in a café in Harvard Square , and there was a National Geographic — ironically — map of the world right in front of us .
And David looked at the map .
We were downing a cup of tea or a beer or whatever it was .
And he suddenly looked at me , and he looked at the map , and he pointed to the Arctic , and he looked at me .
And I had to go somewhere , so I just — plunk — Amazon .
And within two weeks he was in the Arctic , and he never came back .
He ’s still there .
He lives in Alaska — I see him all the time .
And in three weeks I was in the Amazon , where I stayed for a year and a half .

Having decided to go to the Amazon , there was only one man to see , and that was Richard Schultes , the Harvard professor who was the greatest Amazon explorer of the 20th century , without a doubt .
So I knocked on his office door at Harvard .
I just said : “ Sir , I ’m from British Columbia .
I ’ve saved up money in a logging camp .
I want to go to the Amazon like you did and collect plants . ”
At the time , I knew nothing of botany .
I ’d never taken a serious biology course — any biology course — in my life .
And he did n’t ask for credentials .
He just said , “ Well , son , when do you want to go ? ”
And two weeks later I was in the Amazon .
What advice did Schultes give you ?
My poor mother .
I was trying to placate my mother back in Victoria , so I went back to see him to get his advice and he said , “ Do n’t bother with leather boots because all the snakes bite at the neck . ”
And then he said , “ Do n’t forget to bring a pith helmet . ”
And then his third piece of advice was “ do n’t come back without trying ayahuasca , ” which is the most potent of the hallucinogenic preparations of the whole shaman ’s repertoire .
Did you wear a pith helmet ?
No
Get bitten by a snake ?
No . I did step on an anaconda once .
I never had any problems at all .
Did you try ayahuasca ?
Oh yes , many times .
What is it like ?
You are flung into other levels of reality so visceral , so tangible , so all - enveloping , that they become your sense of the real world .
And you suddenly realize that the relatively mundane realm of ordinary consciousness is a crude facsimile of what awaits in the psychotropic trance .
This and other experiences in the presence of people taken by the spirit left me with visceral evidence that cultural beliefs can really make for different human beings , that there are other ways of knowing , other levels of intuition , that cannot necessarily be understood through the filter of Cartesian logic .
What do you mean by “ other ways of knowing ” ?
When Schultes was in the Amazon in the 1940s , the Seona in Ecuador identified for him 17 varieties of ayahuasca liana , and all of them , to his Harvard - trained taxonomic eye , were the same species .
When he finally asked them to give him lessons in the nature of their systematics , they looked at him like he was a fool and said , “ Do n’t you know anything about plants ?
Each one of these 17 , when taken on the night of a full moon , will sing to you in a different key . ”
That ’s not gonna get you a Ph.D. at Harvard , but it ’s more interesting than counting flower parts .
So drugs do for the Seona people what science does for us ?
Not drugs .
That ’s a pejorative notion in our society — cocaine , crack , crystal meth , whatever .
These are n’t drugs .
These are sacred medicines .
These are the facilitators .
These are the avenues to the doorways of the gods .
You went from investigating one kind of sacred medicine to another .
Is that what propelled you from the Amazon to Haiti ?
I have always lived by the adage that if it works , it ’s obsolete .
The minute I get good at something , I generally drop it and try something else .
I was looking around for a thesis topic that would really catch me , and Schultes came up with this zombie thing .
A team of psychopharmacologists led by a man named Nathan Kline­ — he was derided by one newspaper as the father of Thorazine , but his science was impeccable — went on record saying they had found the first zombie .
They did n’t believe in magic , but they believed it was possible that a person could appear to be dead in such a way as to fool a physician .
The existence of a poison that would do that was taken for granted by the Haitian government and specifically mentioned in the penal code of the country , but nobody had investigated to see what was in it .
I went down there almost on a whim , thinking that the assignment would be a lark , a couple weeks in Haiti .
In the end , of course , it consumed four years of my life .
How did you locate the zombie poison ?
I was living in a stone hut on the beach and going out every night alone to these secret societies .
When I went around the country , there was one consistent ingredient in these preparations , and that was these marine fish .
I did n’t know any of these fish from Adam , but I brought back all of the ingredients and the ichthyologist at Harvard identified them : puffer fish .
He turned me on to this biomedical literature , and my God , I found case after case in which people had been nailed in their coffins by mistake .
There was absolutely no doubt scientifically that these fish I had found in Haiti had , at least at certain times of the year , a drug in them , tetrodotoxin [ TTX ] , that could make people appear dead .
Haiti whacked me in the face like a sledgehammer .
I remember that fantastic sense of how surreal Haiti was , a place of such poverty , where people adorn their lives with their imaginations .
I did n’t know it , but I had malaria and hepatitis at the same time .
I felt like that line from the Bob Dylan song , “ Something is happening here , but you do n’t know what it is , do you , Mister Jones ? ”
Eventually a friend had to just pluck me out of Haiti and put me on her farm to write my book .
Why did you write a book before finishing your graduate thesis ?
I walked in off the street in London and got a book advance .
I used the book advance to pay for the research .
Then I sold the rights to Hollywood — I would n’t say naively , because I ’d do it again today .
I mean , name me a graduate student you know who would turn down a quarter - million dollars for the rights to their Ph.D. thesis — let ’s see them line up .
It was a terrible movie .
I risked a lot academically , intellectually , and personally to tell this story with honor and integrity , but it brought down all of this wrath .
People made some serious accusations against you at the time .
What happened ?
The minute those samples came back , Kao called me up and said : “ You ’re all wrong .
Get another thesis topic .
This is nonsense . ”
And I said , “ Dr. Kao , I told you that 50 percent of the time these fish are nontoxic .
It varies tremendously , and it ’s highly significant that either sample showed any at all , because it means that tetrodotoxin was found .
You also have to understand that the Haitian belief system allows a sorcerer an out , a way to rationalize failures and emphasize successes :
If I go down to the beach and give you a poison and absolutely nothing happens , I can say that my attempt to capture your soul was interrupted by a priest who protected you .
I explained all that to this guy , but he began writing hundreds of letters all around the country , unsolicited , saying , “ I ’m here to alert you to a serious case of fraud in science . ”
With all the uproar , I ’m amazed you ever got your Ph.D .
When I wrote my thesis , Irvin DeVore , the greatest biological anthro­pologist in the history of the university , said it was the best Ph.D. he had ever read in his career at Harvard .
But another professor involved in approval was overheard at a party after I was in Time magazine saying that no matter what happened , I would not get my degree .
And sure enough , when the time came around for the faculty to rubber - stamp the approval of the committee , that professor did not put the vote as an agenda item on this faculty board meeting .
And in the meeting he suddenly stood up and started railing against my thesis , apparently .
Fortunately one of my committee members was there , this wonderfully kind botanist .
So after this great tirade , Rolla Tryon just taps — in a classic sort of Harvard moment — taps his pipe on his glass of water and says , “ Excuse me , but have you read the thesis ? ”
And he had to admit that he had never seen it .
After all that , you abandoned the study of zombies .
Why ?
I was driving around Boston with this very close friend of mine , a professor of sociology .
He looked at me — he had known me for years , and he just looked at me and said , “ You know , Wade , do you want to be a zombiologist ? ”
And it was like zazen from a Buddhist monk , because what he was really saying was :
Here you are .
You ’re in this whirlwind .
Doonesbury was doing a three - week parody of the book .
Miami Vice was doing episodes .
I was on the Today show .
It was completely surreal , right ?
And Charlie was saying to me , “ Do you want to spend the rest of your fucking life defending this theory , running around Haiti trying to find more zombies ? ”
And of course I instantly laughed and said no .
And at that instant , I turned my back on the entire story .
I never went back to Haiti , not out of any kind of bitterness or regret .
I did n’t want to be a zombie expert .
Instead , I disappeared into the forests of Borneo .
Haiti , the Amazon , Borneo … How do you manage to fit in no matter where you are ?
You ’re with a bunch of yak herders at night in Tibet , and you ’ve got a choice :
You can hang out with the other scientists and listen to their stories of Chicago or their problems with their wives , or you can just wrap yourself up in a blanket and go down and hang in the body pile with the yak herders and drink rakshi and eat tsampa and fart .
I have a good intuition for finding that kind of opening into culture that allows you to be welcomed .
One of the cultures you celebrate in Light at the Edge of the World is the Inuit .
What do you most admire about them ?
The Inuit did n’t fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
During the 1950s the Canadian government forced the Inuit into settlements .
A family from Arctic Bay told me this fantastic story of their grandfather who refused to go .
The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his tools and all of his implements , thinking that would force him into the settlement .
But instead , he just slipped out of an igloo on a cold Arctic night , pulled down his caribou and sealskin trousers , and defecated into his hand .
As the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of an implement .
And when the blade started to take shape , he put a spray of saliva along the leading edge to sharpen it .
That ’s when what they call the “ shit knife ” took form .
He used it to butcher a dog .
Skinned the dog with it .
Improvised a sled with the dog ’s rib cage , and then , using the skin , he harnessed up an adjacent living dog .
He put the shit knife in his belt and disappeared into the night .
Is that a true story ?
True or not , it ’s a wonderful metaphor for the resilience of the Inuit people .
Once during the migration of the belugas I was watching this Inuit guy fix his snowmobile .
He cleaned the carburetor with this beautiful feather of an Arctic goose .
Then he needed a new clutch plate and had to drive a hole through a piece of steel .
He just put it between his two boots , got his 30 - 30 [ rifle ] out , and boom .
And I thought , “ Wow , these people can do anything . ”
Wait — the Inuit were on snowmobiles , not dogsleds ?
If everybody ’s going modern , what does it mean to preserve culture ?
I do n’t believe in preserving culture .
The real question is , what kind of world do we want to live in — a monochromatic world of monotony , or a polychromatic world of diversity ?
The idea is not to eliminate modernity , as if we ’ve got the right to sequester people like some kind of specimen in a bubble .
If I get my arm ripped off in a car accident , I do n’t want to be taken to a shaman ; no one else does either .
But if the Inuit are living like us , how are they distinct ?
The distinctions between cultures are not decorative — it ’s not feathers and bells or dancers or songs .
Those are the symbols of culture .
The essence of culture is a blanket of moral and ethical values that we place around the individual .
It ’s culture that allows us to make sense out of sensation , to find order in a universe that may have none .
What about your own culture ?
Have you reflected on its meaning in your exploration of the world ?
We do n’t think of ourselves as a culture in the West .
We think that we somehow exist outside of time and culture .
We ’re the real world moving inexorably forward :
Get with it or lose the train .
When the truth is , we ’re the anomaly .
By a remarkable accident of geography , three of British Columbia ’s most important salmon rivers are all born within literally a stone ’s throw of each other in a rugged knot of mountains .
The only other place I know like that is Tibet , where the Brahmaputra and Ganges are born in lakes on the lower flanks of Mount Kailash .
That area is so revered that normally you are not even allowed to climb it .
The idea of putting industrial infrastructure at the headwaters of those rivers would be anathema to Buddhist , Hindu , and Jain .
Yet here we are about to embark upon coal - bed methane exploration and open anthracite coal mines right at the headwaters of our three greatest rivers in British Columbia .
Not only are we prepared to do it , but we do n’t , even in the calculus of our economic planning , have a metric for the value of the land left alone .
In other words , no company that wants to do something there has to compensate Canadians for destroying something so unique .
But we think that this economic system of ours exists out of culture , out of time , and is the inexorable wave of history when , by definition , it is simply the product of a certain set of human beings : our lineage .
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia to believe those forests existed to be cut .
That has made me a human being very different from my friends amongst the Kwagiulth , who believed that those same forests were the abode of the crooked beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits that dwell at the north end of the world .
Given those conflicting perspectives , how can we ever make a connection , let alone straddle different worlds ?
My friend Randy Borman was a young child born of American missionaries , Bub and Bobbie Borman .
They were evangelizing the Kofán in lowland Ecuador in the late 1950s and ’60s .
The Kofán , meanwhile , were evangelizing Randy .
He grew up a blond kid from the Midwest in the jungles of Ecuador in a totally isolated tribe .
Kofán became his first language .
He hunted with the elders and the other boys .
He became thoroughly Kofán in every fiber of his being .
Then he tried to become an American , tried to attend university .
He struggled for a semester and then went back to the jungle and married a Kofán woman .
Before you know it , he ’s chief .
Oil pipelines and colonization had swept into their homeland .
It made perfect sense to them that their chief be a fellow whom they could trust , who could understand their ways but also understand the ways of the invader and could speak English and could speak Spanish and could negotiate in those silver towers in Quito .
Recently I was in Ecuador and I took ayahuasca with Randy and his father - in - law , a well - known shaman .
As Randy said when he first showed microscopes to the Kofán , nothing in the dazzling array of organisms displayed on the glass plate astonished them , because they already knew that multiple levels of reality existed .
They had seen it in their visions .
A Tibetan monk turned to me once and said , “ We do n’t really believe in Tibet that you went to the moon , but you did .
You may not believe we achieve enlightenment in one lifetime , but we do . ”

What causes a third of the cabinet and one in five ministers to break ranks and campaign against their own government ?
Is it faith academies , a massacre in Iraq , or the suspension of habeas corpus ?
None of these .
Go out into the highways and byways of the nation and ask what moves the political soul at present .
It is the threatened closure of some 2,500 local post offices .
Open any local paper and it is a raging obsession .
That is why Jack Straw , Jacqui Smith , Geoff Hoon , Andy Burnham and others agreed with Patricia Hewitt when she ordered the closures as posts minister and then pretended that they did not mean it .
Like those now professing to have been " really " against the Iraq war , they represent the new virtual politics of hypocrisy .
There is something about post offices that has Don Camillo and Peppone marching arm in arm .
That grubby counter at the back of the shop holds the arcane mysteries of forms V14 and V890 .
It can unlock the code of DVLA / V10 , Transcash , Smilers and the whole haberdashery of the general post .
The village post office evokes the age of Hovis and prison mailbags , of bicycle clips and little red vans .
It is the Miss Marple public service , the acceptable face of nationalised industry .
Inside is the time - hallowed communion of the counter queue , shuffling eternally towards the altar of the state , to sip the bread and wine of entitlement .
These queues embody Britain 's love / hate for authority .
They meld the citizen into a stomping , muttering chorus of complaint , into Tennyson 's " a thousand peering littlenesses " .
Some time ago the California town of Carmel ( one - time mayor , Clint Eastwood ) went in the opposite direction from Britain .
It stopped home postal deliveries , except by volunteers to the severely disabled , and ordained that citizens collect mail from the post office on 5th Avenue .
The reason was explicit , to generate a habit of using the office and create a haphazard , neighbourly town meeting , a latter - day Athenian agora .
In Britain such social engineering would be regarded as a sin against target - driven centralism , and probably communist to boot .
Instead closure mania is gripping every corner of Britain 's public service , and people do not like it .
The government has shut almost half of all post offices , from 21,000 to 12,000 , of which only 6,500 are said to be " profitable " .
The remainder require a subsidy of £ 150 m , which is less than the professional fees on a single government hospital contract .
In some cities the result is astonishing .
In London 169 closures are planned , saving just £ 3 m , leaving the entire W14 area of Hammersmith ( the size of Canterbury ) without a single office , and W9 with just one .
The threat to Maida Vale 's Formosa Street office has evoked the sort of fury that greets the closure of a West End theatre .
Nor is it just post offices that vanish .
In the past 10 years the number of police stations fell by over 20 % and a further 40 are threatened , including 13 in London .
Wiltshire plans to have just four stations left in the county .
Rural areas have lost not just their police stations but their village police houses .
In the realm of primary schools , a fixation with parental choice and a terror of sacking bad staff is leading to a sudden rash of closures .
In England and Wales , more than a thousand are now planning to shut , in many cases because parents are driving their children to schools miles away when a council fails to improve a local school .
Shropshire wants to close 22 schools and merge another 16 .
Gwynedd in Wales wants to close 29 .
Nobody stops to ask what the " car miles " cost of this policy might be .
Chaotic planning in the NHS makes it near impossible to know the number of local district and cottage hospitals facing closure at any one time .
A 2006 white paper pledged to " create many new cottage hospitals " - some 50 , at an allotted £ 750 m - at the same time as a pledge to close up to 90 of 360 English cottage hospitals .
The extra -50 pledge emerged as a Downing Street spin exercise .
There is no way of measuring the impact on communities of thus ripping out their institutional memories and meeting places .
It must be savage .
Each plays its part : school , hospital , surgery , police station , post office .
Some statistics speak for themselves .
Since 1997 the number of schools with fewer than 1,000 pupils has fallen by a fifth , while that of super - size secondary schools ( more than 1,500 pupils ) has more than doubled , resulting in a 28 % rise in permanent exclusions , or three times the rate for small schools .
Big is plain bad .
Levels of public fear and a perception of town centre anarchy have risen with the loss of a police presence .
The concentration of services saves the NHS money ( supposedly ) , but imposes travel and insecurity costs on patients and their families .
The growing need to take a bus or car to visit a post office is time - consuming and ecologically stupid .
Some fightback is beginning .
The " closure culture " has produced an upturn in just - in - time politics .
The nation is awash in marches and protests in defence of local institutions .
A march by 7,000 people in Haywards Heath saved an accident unit .
Yesterday Victoria
Wood threatened to chain herself to a postbox in north London .
Essex won plaudits for offering to take its threatened post offices off the government 's hands and merge them with council " one- stop shops " .
In Leicestershire 's Sheepy Magna , £ 45,000 was raised to put a post office into the local parish church .
Pershore in Worcestershire has decided to build its own hospital rather than wait on Whitehall .
Gordon Brown 's concept of a public service as a gigantic , self - contained and unaccountable " business model " is clearly inappropriate to social Britain and is deeply unpopular .
Hazel Blears , the so - called communities minister , has not lifted a finger in protest .
Yet having voted for hospital closures , she herself turned tail and campaigned against them when they hit her Salford constituency .
The government 's Orwellian hostility to the institutional identity of British communities can only promote alienation and indiscipline .
It turns communities into bleak , car - reliant dormitories , devoid of places of casual association .
It removes the informal leadership of the resident teacher , doctor , police officer , shopkeeper .
What central government may think it saves in the general , it loses in the particular .
It is in the particular that people live .

( 20 March 2008 ) This year 's World Water Day , commemorated on Saturday , 22 March , and the International Year of Sanitation 2008 remind us that clean water is the fountain of life and health .
Water is also a source of development , as shown by the villagers of San Rafael de la Laguna , Ecuador .
Through community action , this town transformed the contaminated waters of Lake Imbakucha into a fountain of growth using alternative and traditional technologies , winning third prize in the " Experiences in Social Innovation " competition in 2007 .
The contest is organized by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) , with support from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation .
This success story starts with the need to treat sewage and other polluted waters discharged into the lake from surrounding villages , tourist lodges and flower plantations .
In San Rafael , villagers were concerned about the impact of contamination on production of the totora reeds that are the prime material of local handicrafts .
Along the shore , the pigs , cows and sheep feeding among the reeds - and the shepherds who tend them -- wallowed in a mixture of sewage and mud .
The economic and social development plan adopted by this indigenous community of 4,700 inhabitants was drawn up in municipal assemblies .
The townspeople worked in mingas ( community action , in Quechua ) to build water treatment plants using aquatic lentil and water lettuce .
Totora production has increased and new handcrafts and furniture are being sold by the Totora Sisa community enterprise .
The need to reforest hillsides to conserve water sources led to the creation of a community - owned nursery that sells native trees .
A new tourism enterprise is cashing in on the improved water quality of the lake to offer rides in this Otavalo community 's traditional totora boats .
For Freddy Sánchez , president of the community 's administrative council , the project " is about much more than water treatment and management .
It 's about comprehensive development built on the participation of many actors . "
It 's not hard to determine what 's hot on BitTorrent , just go to your favorite BitTorrent site and order the results by most seeds or peers .
However , finding out what 's popular by people " in the know " usually requires some more steps .
This is exactly the gap PickyPirate is trying to fill .
PickyPirate fetches the most popular movies , games and music albums from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic , two well known review aggregators , and lists them on the frontpage .
For those not familiar with meta - review sites , these websites make a ranking of the movies , games and music albums that received the best reviews from critics .
The links to these entries on Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes are of course included and there you can read the full reviews .
Ehud , the developer of PickyPirate told TorrentFreak that a friend asked him why nobody created a mashup of BitTorrent and Metacritic , “ I immediately thought ‘ Hey , that ’s a really good idea ! ' ” he said .
“ Basically I never know what to download from all the stuff that ’s available . ”
The site currently lists most popular items from the last 30 days for all categories ( Music , Movies , PC Games , Xbox 360 and Wii ) .
The lists are updated every 15 minutes , so if the scores change on Metacritic , they will be quickly updated on Picky Pirate too .
If you click on one of the items on the frontpage it automatically lists all the “ relevant torrents ” available on The Pirate Bay and Mininova for that title , but more sites might be added later .
BitTorrent users have a huge amount of material at their fingertips and as such , they can afford to be very picky indeed .
However , not everyone has the time to be picky but with the help of sites like this , allowing others to do it on your behalf can come a good second .

Study : Beautiful Women Want
It All Women gauge what they can get by what they 've got -- namely , their looks .
March 26 , 2008  --
A new study out of the University of Texas argues that beautiful women want it all when it comes to picking a mate .
In fact , the more beautiful a woman is , the higher her standards .
But , perhaps surprisingly , the study did not find that to be the case when it comes to men .
It takes more than being a hunk for a man to want everything .
He must also have status and the potential to be a good provider before he is likely to demand the best .
On the surface it sounds like just another study showing that men are different from women , as if we did n't already know that .
But this is a serious effort to delve into an area that has been largely ignored by scientists :
How a woman's own attractiveness influences her preferences when she picks a mate .
The broad hypothesis " that high mate - value women want it all has never been comprehensively tested , " the study claims .
What it boils down to is that a woman who has it all , wants it all , said psychologist David Buss , lead author of the study in the current issue of Evolutionary Psychology .
Buss and psychologist Todd Shackelford of Florida Atlantic University studied 107 couples who had been married less than a year to learn what both the men and the women wanted most in a mate .
Psychologists call it " mate value , " and it 's different for men and for women , which may explain why the study produced different results for the two genders .
" Physical attractiveness is a more important component of women 's mate value than of men's , " Buss said in an e-mail .
" Status , economic prospects , and other attributes linked with resource acquisition are more important components of men's than of women 's mate value .
So this leads to the prediction that men high in status and resources will elevate their standards , just as physically attractive women elevate their standards . "
There is an evolutionary basis for these differences , the researchers contend .
Humans , like all other animals , are most concerned about reproduction and passing their genes on to their children .
Physical beauty gives a woman more leverage — or mate value — when it comes to picking a man .
And men have more appeal if they are likely to be good providers .
It was n't so complicated in the old days , before modern social standards evolved .
" The most reproductively successful men historically and cross-culturally were those who married young , secured multiple wives , and opportunistically engaged in sex with other men's wives when the risks were low , " the study notes .
And women were more successful at reproduction if they picked various mates for different functions , such as marrying a guy with money but making out with a guy with great genes .
All that is frowned upon these days .
So if you 've got to get the best mate for the money because it may be the only one you will have , mate value becomes an important commodity .
For their study , the researchers subjected all 214 participants to a series of interviews designed to measure what they most wanted in a mate , such as good genes , potentially a good provider , a good parent , and a good partner .
But because they were primarily interested in how personal beauty influenced their preferences , they had to determine which of all those folks were beauties , and which were beasts , or somewhere in between .
Eight teams of interviewers , one male and one female , were faced with that seemingly daunting task .
But it 's not as hard as it seems , Buss said .
There 's much agreement on what makes a woman attractive , such as youth and health , although some prefer blondes over brunettes .
So , by applying standards that are widely accepted in the world of psychology , each interviewer rated each participant .
The opinions of each of the interviewers were combined , or averaged , yielding a " reliable and less idiosyncratic assay , " Buss added .
So he 's satisfied that the women judged to be beautiful were indeed beauties , and those judged less beautiful were less attractive .
And the researchers found a clear correlation between personal beauty and what they wanted in a mate .
( We 're ignoring the men here because there was no clear correlation . )
Here are some of the findings :
The results showed that the most attractive women consistently had the highest standards , except for one peculiar exception .
When it came to evaluating intelligence as a " good gene indicator , " being intelligent was at the very bottom of the list for both the beauties and the plain Janes .
Buss explained that although " intelligence is one of the most highly valued traits in a mate , attractive women do not desire it any more ( or any less ) than less attractive women . "
His study , however , described the finding as a " puzzle . "
Attractive women should value intelligence more , if their personal attractiveness elevates their overall standards , but they do not .
Of course , the researchers concede that beauty is not the only force working here .
Personality , talent , kindness , and maybe even quirkiness , may tip the scales .
And for the romantics among us , maybe sometimes we 're just lucky enough to fall in love with the right person , regardless or perhaps unaware of " mate value . "

NO TORTURE .
NO EXCEPTIONS ….
The latest issue of the Monthly is devoted to a single subject : torture .
An editors ’ note explains :
In most issues of the Washington Monthly , we favor articles that we hope will launch a debate .
In this issue we seek to end one .
The unifying message of the articles that follow is , simply , Stop .
What follows is a set of 37 short essays by writers from all over the political spectrum , from Bob Barr on the right to Nancy Pelosi and Jimmy Carter on the left .
You can find them all here , and I ’ll be highlighting a few of them throughout the week .
In one of them , journalist Peter Bergen talks about the torture of Ramzi bin al - Shibh and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed :
What is perhaps most astonishing of all is that the mistreatment of KSM and bin al - Shibh was entirely unnecessary .
Before they were captured , they had explained the details of the 9/11 attacks in an April 2002 interview with Yosri Fouda , an Al Jazeera correspondent … .
The CIA provided summaries of the interrogations of KSM and bin al - Shibh to the 9/11 Commission .
There is little or no difference between the account that KSM and bin al - Shibh freely volunteered to Fouda in the spring of 2002 and the version the commission published in its 2004 report .
Nor was Fouda ’s reporting difficult to find : he hosted a one - hour documentary on Al Jazeera , wrote a long piece in London ’s Sunday Times , and coauthored a book , Masterminds of Terror , about KSM and bin al - Shibh .
By the time CIA officials captured the pair , a full account of their operations was only a Google search away .
Obviously , then , it was unnecessary to waterboard KSM to find out what he knew about the 9/11 plot .
What , though , of the administration ’s assertion that coercive interrogation techniques have saved American lives ?
To assess that claim , we must examine the details of other terrorist plots that KSM gave up after his capture , presented in a document the government released in 2006 : KSM launched several plots targeting the US Homeland , including a plot in late 2001 to have … suicide operatives hijack a plane over the Pacific and crash it into a skyscraper on the US West Coast ; a plan in early 2002 to send al - Qa’ida operatives to conduct attacks in the U.S. ; and a plot in early 2003 to employ a network of Pakistanis … to smuggle explosives into New York and to target gas stations , railroad tracks , and a bridge in New York .
It all sounds very frightening , except that there is no indication that these plots were ever more than talk .
In other words , not only was torture unnecessary , but it was actually counterproductive .
KSM produced no new information under torture , only a litany of false confessions — maybe out of vanity , maybe in an effort to protect other al - Qaeda operatives .
Who knows .
What we do know is that torturing KSM did no good , sent hundreds of agents scurrying after phantoms , and has made his prosecution far more difficult than it needed to be .
Most of you reading this hardly need to be convinced on this score .
But you almost certainly know people who do need to be convinced — and who need more than just a moral argument .
So this is it .
The next time somebody asks , tell them the story of Ramzi bin al - Shibh and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Tell them the story of not just how torture has tainted America ’s claim to the moral high ground throughout the world , but how it ’s actively hurt the war on terror .
Tell them .

The modern country of Lebanon has a rich heritage Scientists have detected the faint genetic traces left by medieval crusaders in the Middle East .
The team says it found a particular DNA signature which recently appeared in Lebanon and is probably linked to the crusades .
The finding comes from the Genographic Project , a major effort to track human migrations through DNA .
Details of the research have been published in the American Journal of Human Genetics .
The researchers found that some Christian men in Lebanon carry a DNA signature hailing from Western Europe .
Four crusades came through Lebanon between the 11th and 13th Centuries - the first , second , third and sixth .
The bulk of the crusader armies came from England , France , Germany and Italy ; many of the men stayed to build castles and settlements , mixing with the local populations .
The scientists also found that Lebanese Muslim men were more likely than Christians to carry a particular genetic signature .
But this one is linked to expansions from the Arabian Peninsula which brought Islam to the area in the 7th and 8th Centuries .
But they emphasise that the differences between the two communities are minor , and that Christians and Muslim Arabs in Lebanon overwhelmingly share a common heritage .
Genetic ' surname '
The legacy of the Muslim expansion has been demonstrated in other studies which looked at the genetics of Middle Eastern and North African populations .
But signs of recent European migration to the region are more unusual .
The study focused on the Y , or male , chromosome , a package of genetic material carried only by men that is passed down from father to son more or less unchanged , just like a surname .
The goal of the study was to put some science to the history of this country
Pierre Zalloua , Lebanese American University
But over many generations , the chromosome accumulates small changes , or copying errors , in its DNA sequence .
These can be used to classify male chromosomes into different groups ( called haplogroups ) which , to some extent , reflect a person 's geographical ancestry .
The team analysed the Y chromosomes of 926 Lebanese males and found that patterns of male genetic variation in Lebanon fell more along religious lines than along geographical lines .
A genetic signature on the male chromosome called WES1 , which is usually only found in west European populations , was found among the Lebanese men included in the study .
Science and history " It seems to have come in from Europe and is found mostly in the Christian population , " said Dr Spencer Wells , director of the Genographic Project .
" This is odd because typically we do n't see this sort of stratification by religion when we are looking at the relative proportions of these lineages - and particularly immigration events . "
He told BBC News : " Looking at the same data set , we saw a similar enrichment of lineages coming in from the Arabian Peninsula in the Muslim population which we did n't see [ as often ] in the Christian population . "
Lebanese Muslim men were found to have high frequencies of a Y chromosome grouping known as J1 .
This is typical of populations originating from the Arabian Peninsula , who were involved in the Muslim expansion .
" The goal of the study was to put some science to the history of this country - which is very rich , " said Pierre Zalloua , a co-author on the paper , from the Lebanese American University in Beirut .
He added : " To have these great civilisations - with the Islamic expansion and the migration from Europe - coming to Lebanon , leaving not only their genes but also some of their culture and way of life , it can only make us feel richer . "
The Genographic Project was launched by National Geographic in 2005 to help piece together a picture of how the Earth was populated .
The consortium has sold 250,000 DNA test kits and regional centres have taken samples of genetic material from 31,000 indigenous people .

Scientology -- Is This a Religion ?

This is a revised and corrected version of a shorter presentation given at the 27th Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag , June 20 , 1997 , Leipzig , Germany .
June 30 , 1997
Scientology -- Is This a Religion ?
Rarely , if ever , in the post - war period have diplomats from the superpowers troubled themselves over questions about the alleged religious nature of a transnational organization .
Consequently , the current debate between Germany and the United States over the alleged religious nature of Scientology is remarkable , and probably unique in recent history .
The fact that German officials , institutions , and citizens are seeking additional information about this organization is commendable , and I am grateful for the opportunity to share insights that may help to clarify the issues in this debate .
For the record , I did not have any contact with German parliamentary officials as I was preparing my talk .
For about ten minutes I spoke by telephone with one German professor who is involved with the current discussion about the organization , but we only touched briefly on issues related to Scientology .
The German Kirchentag paid my air fare and my hotel in Leipzig , and Berliner Dialog is covering some of my expenses , but they are not paying me a fee or honorarium .
I prepared my talk while in Canada , and did not consult with anyone in Germany or elsewhere about its content .
I had complete freedom to write whatever I wanted around the general topic of the debate about Scientology 's religious claims .
As a person trained in religious studies , I find the debate about Scientology 's alleged religious nature to be an interesting and important one .
It should not be , however , the only issue over which we evaluate the German - American debate over Scientology 's religious claims .
Intimately related to the religious question are human rights questions .
Some people assume that religious practice is a guaranteed human right , but even a superficial examination of world events shows that many atrocities occur in the name of God or religion .
Universally , therefore , religious belief must receive absolute protection , but religious practice stemming from that belief must receive protection only until it begins to violate the rights of its members or nonmembers .
Following from this last point , I argue that even if Scientology contains a theology and cosmology that some members interpret religiously , its organizational actions and behaviours raise serious human rights questions .
Without wanting to review the pronouncements from all German officials about the organization , I conclude that the German government has good reason to investigate Scientology 's activities in this country .
It also has compelling reasons to inquire about the well - being of German citizens in Scientology facilities in the United States and elsewhere .
I will share just a few of the documents that led me to these conclusions , and some of them are available in numerous world wide web sites on the " internet . "
For a number of my social scientific colleagues around the world , the debate between Germany and the U.S. revolves around the question of Scientology 's religious claims .
Many of my social scientific colleagues have examined some Scientology documents and possibly participated in some Scientology events , and they have concluded that the organization is religious in nature .
Bryan R. Wilson ( b. 1926 ) , for example , who is a respected British sociologist of religion , concluded " that Scientology must indeed be regarded as a religion " ( Wilson , 1990 : 288 ) .
He reached this conclusion after comparing Scientology 's belief system with twenty characteristics usually found within what he called " known religions " ( Wilson , 1990 : 279 ) .
Significantly for the current debate in this country , he dismissed historical information from the early 1950s about Dianetics presenting itself as " a mental therapy and Scientology a science . "
Specifically with these early self - representations in mind , Wilson insisted that " even if it could be conclusively shown that Scientology took the title of ' church ' specifically to secure at law as a religion , that would say nothing about the status of the belief - system , and it is with the belief system that we are specifically concerned " ( Wilson , 1990 : 282-283 ) . [ 1 ]
Footnote : [ 1 ]
Undoubtedly because of this interpretation , Wilson has become a champion of Scientology 's religious claims ( see also Wilson , n.d. : 35 ) and the organization alludes to him ( " [t ] he foremost sociologist in the world " ) as an academic who concluded " that Scientology was setting the trend for the 21st century for all religions -- as it offers practical solutions for people 's problems in the real world " ( International Association of Scientologists , 1995 : [ 10 ] ) .
Scientology also employs his opinion in arguing before an American court that the organization has the right to keep secret its upper level materials ( Wilson , 1994 : 11 ) .
In fact , I have made precisely the argument that Wilson dismisses .
In a study that Berliner Dialog ( Heft 1 - 97 ) translated into German , and in another study that I hope to publish soon , I show that L. Ron Hubbard ( Scientology 's founder ) claimed that Scientology was a religion because he saw the claim as a marketing device to make money and avoid taxes ( Kent , 1997b : 25 ff ; Miller , 1987 : 199-203 , 220 ) as well as a way " to reduce the likelihood of governmental interventions against it for allegedly practising medicine without a license " ( Kent , 1996 : 30 ) .
Moreover , Scientology denies its reputedly religious nature if it is attempting to enter a country that might react adversely to religious proselytization ( such as Japan or Greece [ Kent , 1997a : 18 - 19 ] ) .
Nevertheless , the historical reasons behind Scientology 's religious claims , as well as the organization 's selectivity in making the claims , do not diminish the probability that many Scientologists view their commitment as a religious one .
From a social scientific perspective , and probably from a legal one as well , the objective " truth " of an ideology is not the determinant of a group 's " religious " designation .
Mere belief in supernatural beings or forces may be enough to get an ideology designated as religious , even if the origins or doctrines of the belief system are highly suspect .
Along these lines , the inspirational figure in the sociology of religion , Max Weber , refused to exclude charlatans from his identification of charismatic figures , since the devotion of followers was a far more salient fact than authenticity .
After mentioning two types of charismatic figures , Weber added that " [ a ] nother type is represented by Joseph Smith , the founder of Mormonisn , who may have been a very sophisticated swindler ( although this cannot be definitely established ) " ( Weber , 1968 : 242 ) .
Similarly , from a social scientific perspective , a belief system is religious if it contains supposedly supernatural elements , regardless of the accuracy of those elements .
Perhaps unlike Joseph Smith , Hubbard 's sophisticated swindle has been definitely exposed by a number of critics ( for example , Atack , 1990 ; Kent , 1996 ; Miller , 1987 ) who have shown that his religious alignment was purely expedient , but now many of his followers see their lives in the context of the doctrines that he developed .
Even if we grant the point that Scientology cosmology and soteriology have supernatural elements that classify the belief - system as religious ( regardless of these elements ' suspect history ) , neither government officials nor society at large should necessarily grant Scientology religious status for purposes of receiving societal benefits .
Rather than struggling over whether or not to label Scientology as a religion , I find it far more helpful to view it as a multifaceted transnational , only one element of which is religious .
Coinciding with supernatural claims are equally important secular dimensions relating to political aspirations , business operations , cultural productions , pseudo - medical practice , pseudo - psychiatric practice , social services ( some of which are of dubious quality ) , and alternative family structures .
A few examples of each dimension will suffice , but countless examples of each one exist throughout both Scientology 's literature and the social behaviour of its members .
The most salient aspect of Scientology , however , is the totalitarian , some would say fascistic , use of power that holds the organization together .
I will speak about some of these totalitarian uses of power , and in doing so it will be very clear that the German government has taken the only appropriate avenue open to it .
Scientology 's political aspirations have surfaced at various times throughout its nearly fifty year history , with the organization involving itself with politicians or political structures in Rhodesian ( in 1966 ) , Greece ( in 1968 to 1969 ) , Morocco ( in 1972 ) , and in the Russian city of Perm ( where it was training city officials in Hubbard Management ideology ) .
Observers wonder about the fate of Scientology training to Albanian government officials after the recent popular uprisings and social collapse ( see Kent , 1997a : 17-18 ) .
At times related to its political aspirations ( as in Perm ) are Scientology 's programs designed to train business executives and professionals often in medically related areas .
Through an organization named WISE ( World Institute of Scientology Enterprises ) , Scientology offers a business consultancy and management program .
A recent publication claims that " WISE [ m ] embers form a network of highly trained consultants in Hubbard Management Technology who can provide you with tailor - made training programs to suit your company 's needs " ( WISE International , 1994 b ) .
WISE programs target various clients through numerous companies , and in Germany and other parts of Europe the best known WISE company is U - Man ( see , for example , WISE International , 1994a ) .
For all practical purposes , this dimension of Scientology is secular , regardless of how the organization portrays it .
Culturally , Scientology has an entire industry devoted to the production and dissemination of Hubbard 's writings and ideological material to both members and outsiders .
The Scientology owned and operated ( and now tax exempt ) Bridge Publications , for example , produced a volume solely dedicated to The Fiction of L. Ron Hubbard ( Widder , 1994 ) , which discusses his writings of Westerns , adventure stories , mystery and detective stories , romance , fantasy , science fiction , plays , and screenplays ( among others ) , and makes little if any mention of his supposedly " religious " writings .
The actor and Scientology public relations officer , John Travolta ( Anderson , 1980 : 3 ; Church of Scientology International , 1994 ) , is working on a movie version of Hubbard 's science fiction work , Battlefield Earth , while a team of Hollywood producers is developing a film version of the Hubbard pulp novel , To the Stars ( Reuters , 1997 ) .
As these current film productions suggest , Scientology is eager to be involved with projects that disseminate its ideology to nonmembers through high profile cultural undertakings .
One vital aspect of this dissemination effort involves cultivating the conversion and support of society 's cultural celebrities .
Beginning in 1955 , Hubbard 's " Project Celebrity " targeted what he called " prime communicators " with the hope that they would " mention " Scientology " now and again " ( [ Hubbard ] , 1955 ) .
By 1992 , thirteen " celebrity centres " existed around the world ( Church of Scientology International , 1992 : 353 ) , and their purpose was " [ t ] o fully utilize opinion leaders and Scientologists to permeate society and get all the different publics utilizing LRH's Technology in every aspect ... " ( Jentzsch and Foster , 1977 : 1 ) .
This organizational push to get everyone using Hubbard 's so - called technology has dramatic secular implications for such issues of how to organize an office , how to generate and handle money , and how to measure office growth .
It presumably also may have implications for people 's supernatural belief systems , but it is understandable that critics see Scientology celebrities as participating in the dissemination of secular Scientology goals .
In addition to free publicity for Scientology , celebrities also give large financial contributions back to the organization .
Had Scientologist Chick Corea , for example , received money from the Baden - Wurttemberg state culture ministry for performing at state - sponsored events , then some of that income may have become part of his contributions to the International Association of Scientologists .
The avowed purpose of this organization is " [ t ] o unite , advance , support and protect the Scientology religion and Scientologists in all parts of the world , so as to achieve the Aims of Scientology as originated by L. Ron Hubbard " ( International Association of Scientologists , 1995 : [ back cover ] ) .
In one of the Association 's 1995 magazines , both he and actress Kirstie Alley each appeared as having contributed US $ 100,000 ( Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International , 1995 : 8 ; International Association of Scientologists Administration , 1995 : 49 , see 60 ) .
By comparison , the $ 2,000 contribution that John Travolta made seems small ( Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International , 1996 : 8 ; see International Association of Scientologists Administration , 1995 : 60 ) .
What Germans will want to know , however , is that this organization provided grants to the Church of Scientology International in order to fund the series of anti-Germany ads in the New York Times and the Washington Post ( both beginning , I believe , on September 15 , 1994 ) .
Utilizing cultural productions and prominent cultural figures , therefore , to disseminate all aspects of Hubbard 's so - called tech is an intimate aspect of the organization 's overall public relations and ( it would seem ) financial strategies .
A glimpse into Scientology 's pseudo - medical practices -- in this case one that also relates to a social service effort of dubious effectiveness -- is its Narconon program .
This program purports to rid the body of drug and radiation residues , and a 1996 Scientology publication told a story about an American Gulf War veteran suffering from Gulf War Syndrome who " arrived to do the detoxification program ... complain[ing ] of disorientation , dizziness , memory loss and muscle and joint pain .
He finished the program and has no more dizziness , memory loss OR muscle and joint pain -- ALL his symptoms have been handled TOTALLY " ( Church of Scientology International , 1996 : 68 [ original emphasis ) .
You may have read recently that Scientologists applied the Narconon program to children suffering from radiation - related illnesses in Chernobyl ( Bev , 1997 ) .
Regardless of how Scientology portrays these claims , they are medical ones that purport to offer a social service , but one about which experts remain highly critical .
In the American state of Oklahoma , for example , a 1991 mental health board examined a Narconon program and concluded that " there is substantial credible evidence , as found by the Board , that the Narconon Program is unsafe and ineffective " ( Mental Health Board , 1991 ; reproduced in Lobsinger , 1991 : 58 ) .
Another dimension of pseudo - medical claims are pseudo - psychiatric ones .
Scientology 's hatred of psychiatry is worthy of a study in itself , and some of its own documents very clearly indicate that Scientology 's primary social purpose is the destruction of psychiatry and its replacement with Scientology techniques .
In , for example , a confidential document written for Scientology 's intelligence branch ( then known as the Guardian Office ) , the unidentified author , who most certainly was Hubbard himself , had a section entitled " The War . "
The text in this section stated that " [ o ] ur war has been forced to become ' To take over absolutely the field of mental healing on this planet in all forms . ' "
The next sentences have significant implications for the current religious debate .
" That was not the original purpose .
The original purpose was to clear Earth .
The battles suffered developed the data that we had an enemy who would have to be gotten out of the way and this meant we were at war " ( [ Hubbard ] , 1969 : [ 5 ] ) .
The central target in Scientology 's efforts to " take over the field of mental healing " is psychiatry .
Indeed , several Scientology organizations , including the Citizens Commission on Human Rights , the International Association of Scientologists , and Freedom magazine are working diligently in attempting to achieve the goal of " Eradicating Psychiatry " ( Weiland , 1990 : 21 ) .
One aspect of Scientology 's efforts to eradicate psychiatry and replace it with its own techniques is that members can take a course ( called a rundown ) that claims to teach members how to cure psychosis .
Called the " Introspection Rundown Auditor Course , " this course supposedly " factually handles the last of the ' unsolvable ' conditions which can trap a person -- the psychotic break .
And end forever the ' reason ' psychs were kept around with their icepicks and shock machines " ( Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization , 1992 : [ 2 ] ) .
This course is based upon what Hubbard described as " a technical breakthrough which possibly ranks with the major discoveries of the Twentieth Century . "
The consequence of this alleged breakthrough was that " THIS MEANS THE LAST REASON TO HAVE PSYCHIATRY AROUND IS GONE " ( Hubbard , 1974 : 346 ) .
The self - proclaimed " breakthrough " involved isolating the person having the psychotic breakdown while not speaking to the person , giving the person particular vitamins and minerals , determining what incident triggered the illness , then putting the person through a long and complex series of Scientology " counselling " sessions ( called auditing ) that focus on the triggering incident Hubbard , 1974 : 353 ) .
Currently this course is at the centre of controversy involving the December 5 , 1995 death of Scientologist Lisa McPherson in Clearwater , Florida .
After a minor car accident , McPherson exhibited bizarre behaviour -- publicly undressing , speaking in monotone with a fixed stare , exhibiting forgetfulness and confusion , and crying .
Against medical advice , she signed herself out of a hospital and into the care of visiting Scientology " friends " who took her to the organization 's Fort Harrison Hotel .
Seventeen days later , Scientologists took her back to a somewhat distant hospital where a doctor was working who was a Scientologist , and he pronounced her dead .
A police investigation continues over her death , but McPherson 's estate launched a lawsuit that accused Scientology " of allowing McPherson to languish in a coma without nutrition and liquids while she was in isolation as part of an Introspection Rundown " ( Tobin , 1997 : 12A ) .
In this context , a Scientology lawyer acknowledged " that the Introspection Rundown remains ' part of church services ' " ( Tobin , 1997 : 12A ) .
Undoubtedly , therefore , Scientology practices pseudo - psychiatry , and the lawsuit over McPherson 's death may establish the extent to which at least one of these practices can have potentially fatal consequences .
Finally , Scientology is an alternative family structure , at least as it is lived by its most devoted followers who are members of a Scientology organization called Sea Org[ anization ] .
Scientology portrays the Sea Org as " a fraternal organization existing within the formalized structure of the Churches of Scientology .
It consists of highly dedicated members of the Church [ who ] take vows of service " ( Church of Scientology of California , 1978 : 205 ) .
( The organization downplays the fact that these people sign billion year contracts . )
Many indicators point to the fact that Scientology structures the Sea Org in a manner that damages parent - child relations if not the well - being of children in general .
In essence , Sea Org becomes one 's new family , often at the expense of spouses and children .
Indication of organizationally influenced damage caused by Sea Org parents to their children formed the basis of a critical article that appeared in a major newspaper of the Florida city near to where the Scientology organization called Flag is based .
In November , 1991 , the St. Petersburg Times ran a long article entitled , " Scientology 's Children , " and it contained an excerpt about a German mother and her son :
Eva Kleinberg moved from Germany to Clearwater with her 9 - year old son , Mark , in 1986 .
She had joined a group of Scientology staff members called the ' Sea Org . '
Eva was told she would have two hours a day for family time .
But with her travel time from work , she said she actually had only one hour with her son .
Because of the 12 - hour workdays , she could n't always stay awake for the full hour .
' I would compromise with my son , ' she said .
After eating , she and her son would divide the remaining half - hour of their family time .
' I would play a game with him for 15 minutes , and I would go to lay down for 15 minutes and sleep . '
While Eva worked , Mark cleaned up around the motel or played with friends .
About a year later , Eva and Mark left the church .
Asked what he thinks of Scientology , Mark , now 14 , said , ' I do n't think it 's good ' cause the people ... they do n't get to spend time with their family and it 's real expensive . '
Church spokesman Richard Haworth said staff Scientologists actually spend three or four hours a day with their children , which he said is more than the average family ( Krueger , 1991 : 12A ) .
I believe the Kleinbergs ' account rather than the one by the Scientology spokesperson because I had heard the same scenario ( about parents having little time to spend with children ) during an interview with a former Sea Org member that I conducted in December , 1987 .
At Flag in Florida during the late 1970s and early 1980s , infants stayed in a Scientology - run nursery during the day when parents worked , and usually parents would return from work at about 6:00 in the evening and spend about an hour - and - a - half with their children before taking them back to the nursery at 7:30 for bed .
Parents then caught a bus back to the Sea Org , and finally did not leave for the night until 10:30 or later .
In the morning , they would pick up their children from the nursery , have them dressed and in the dining room by 7:30 AM , drop them back at the nursery , and be on the bus going to work by ten minutes past 8 .
This informant added , however , that " there 'd be some people who had kids who did n't go home for two or three days in a row .
They'd be working all night " ( Kent interview with Fern , 1987 : 44 , see 43 ) .
The Kleinbergs ' account about limited family time also rings true because of a series of internal memos ( of which I have copies ) from Scientology 's Pacific Area Command ( in Los Angeles , California ) beginning in early November , 1989 .
These memos centre around an Executive Directive that the commanding officer issued which abolished the one hour nightly family time .
He cited two reasons for doing so .
First , he claimed , " [ a ] thorough research [ sic ] revealed that there is no LRH [ L. Ron Hubbard ] reference covering Sea Org members taking 1 hour family time per day .
Also to have such break in schedules in the middle of production has been found to be detrimental to production .... "
Instead he wanted people to work the extra hour a day in order to build up their production output so that they would receive a " liberty day " ( Gouessan , 1989 ) once every two weeks ( Shapiro , 1989 ) .
Several parents objected , and their objections were revealing .
One person asked rhetorically , " [ h ] ow can one keep track of one 's child without even an hour a day with the child ?
I HAVE seen staff distracted by NOT caring for their children and this time could be well utilized for this " ( Swartz , 1989 ) .
Another person cited the text of a Hubbard tape where Scientology 's founder complained about a condition that he had seen ( and which he said had existed in the Pacific Area Command ) : " I wish somebody would tell me why we consistently had to ORDER parents to see their children when they had n't seen them for weeks " ( Hubbard , Transcript of LRH Taped Briefing to CS - & and Pers Comm 22 Sept 73 ; attached to Shapiro , 1989 ) .
This same person acknowledged in his letter of protest that " [ i ] n the 19 years I have been in the Sea Org in PAC this condition ( parental neglect , etc. ) has several times been the source of major upset and enturbulation [ agitation ] on Church lines " ( Shapiro , 1989 [ round brackets in original ] ) .
Taken together , the interview material , media accounts , internal policy directive , and responses point to the fact that parents ' time with their children is severely constrained and sometimes eliminated because of the organizational pressure and job demands under which Sea Org members work .
It seems that Scientology , in its Sea Org manifestation , becomes something akin to an alternative or " fictive " family structure to its members ( see Cartwright and Kent , 1992 : 348-349 ) , receiving more time and commitment than their own children .
On a related point , the new Sea Org family to which adults devote their lives may at times place children in medically detrimental situations .
This fictive family may not always be a medically responsible one .
The informant whom I interviewed in 1978 , for example , complained to me that " the nursery conditions were terrible . "
She complained that , in one nursery room , " there were , I think , sixteen babies in the room , all under a year old , and throughout the whole day , there were three nannies who did shifts in that room , looking after sixteen babies all under a year old " ( Kent interview with Fern , 1987 : 48 ) .
Under these conditions , children developed medical problems ( according to my informant , Fern ) , because the facility did not have an isolation nursery .
Consequently , common childhood illnesses ( such as ear infections ) spread rapidly among the children and remained in the nursery population for a long time .
To support her assertion , this informant showed me medical records that she kept of her child 's visits to doctors while the child was under nursery care , and compared them with similar records from after the time that she and her child left Sea Org and the nursery arrangement .
The child made seventeen visits to the doctor 's office during an eight month period while in the nursery , then only four visits in the twenty - nine months following the family 's departure from the organization ( Kent interview with Fern , 1987 : 49-50 ) .
Researchers always must be cautious in accepting as fact the account of a single person , but I heard similar stories about the condition of children 's facilities in Scientology 's child care program on the other side of the American continent -- Los Angeles , California .
The person who related the account had occasion to visit the children 's facility ( called the Cadet Org ) in the late 1970s or early 1980s , and she saw an infant who was the child of a man she knew .
This child , she stated :
was very , very ill and she was laying in a urine soaked crib and she was -- she just had her diaper on ....
She had lots of like little fruit flies and gnats on her body and she had been so ill that she had tremendous amounts of mucous plugging her nose and her eyes were , like , welded shut with mucous and I , I just snapped in my head ( Kent Interview with Pat , 1997 : 34 ) .
After this incident of allegedly witnessing severe child neglect , the person began plotting how she would leave the organization .
The final example of alleged child neglect is documented in a report filed by the commanding officer of the Cadet Estates Organization in late October , 1989 , concerning the hygiene of three children -- ages 4 , 8 , and 10 or 11 .
Two of the children had lice , and for one of them it was a recurring problem .
A guardian was in charge of them , but she " is herself on mission quite often . "
[ That is to say , the organization frequently sent her away on assignments . ]
The report continued by stating that , " [ w ] hile the guardian was on a mission , the kids were picked up at night by another staff member that [ sic : who ] lives next door , and the little one would be brought in in the morning while the other two older once [ sic : ones ] would walk to the Cadet Org by themself [ sic ] .
The children would dress themself [ sic ] and we have no data who does the laundry or room hygiene for the children " ( Gabriele , 1989 : 1 ) .
We must be careful when interpreting this data on possible child neglect or endangerment , since none of it is current .
Sufficient indicators exist , however , that investigative officials in the United States and elsewhere should examine Scientology 's treatment of Sea Org children .
Because the attitude among some Sea Org leadership appears to be that children hinder adults from performing their vital assignments , researchers should not be surprised to learn of pressures that Sea Org women felt to either abort pregnancies or give - up children for adoption .
My 1987 informant told me that when Sea Org operated on ships during the mid 1970s , women knew that they were not allowed to raise children on the vessels .
Consequently , they experienced pressure to have abortions .
She told me that , " on the ship , I know of a lot of people that [ sic : who ] had abortions , because they did n't want to leave the ship .
It was n't like anybody said ' You have got to get an abortion . '
It was more an implied thing .
If you do n't you 're going to leave " ( Kent interview with Fern , 1989 : 41 - 42 ) .
Years later I saw the same pressures described in a 1994 legal declaration by Mary Tabayoyon , who became a Scientologist in 1967 , joined Sea Org in 1971 , and stayed in it until her departure in 1992 .
She stated that in 1986 , while on the Scientology base in Hemet , California , " members of the Sea Org were forbidden to have any more children if they were to stay on post [ , ] and the Hubbard technology was applied to coercively persuade us to have abortions so that we could remain on post " ( M. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 2 ) .
The pressure came partly through what Scientology called " ethics handling , " which involved the organization pressing people to conform to Hubbard 's policies and the organization 's directives .
Tabayoyon herself " gave up my child due to my greatly misguided obligation and dedication to the Sea Org " ( M. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 4 ) .
She relinquished her child after being " indoctrinated to believe that I should never put my own personal desires ahead of the accomplishment of the purpose of the Sea Org " ( M. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 5 ) .
Taken together , the interviews , legal declarations , media accounts , and internal documents present troubling glimpses into the lives of Scientology 's most committed members .
Sea
Org obligations override many personal and family obligations and responsibilities , and devotion to the Scientology cause often appears to take priority over the needs of children .
Equally disturbing , however , are accounts that some older children and teenagers have had to endure , along with Sea Org adults , the abuses of Scientology 's forced labour and reindoctrination programs .
Although several labour and intensive instruction programs have operated within the Scientology organization over the years , among the most intense ones is the Rehabilitation Project Force -- usually just called the RPF .
When Sea Org members commit what the organization considers to be serious deviations ( such as dramatic e-meter readings , unsatisfactory job performance , or job disruption [ including challenges to senior officials ] ) , then they likely wind up in the RPF .
Even discussing the policies and techniques that Hubbard wrote by using ideas other than his own was called " verbal tech " and apparently was a punishable act ( see Hubbard , 1976 : 546 ) .
Begun in early 1974 while Hubbard and his crew still were at sea , it now operates in several locations around the world .
Currently RPFs are running at the Cedars of Lebanon building in Los Angeles ; on the Scientology property near Hemet , California ; in the facilities in Clearwater , Florida ; and in the British headquarters at East Grinstead , Sussex .
I cannot confirm the existence of RPFs in or near Copenhagen ( Denmark ) , Johannesburg ( South Africa ) , Sydney ( Australia ) , and several other American locations .
In a phrase , the RPF program places Scientology 's most committed members in forced labour and re-education camps .
The operation of these camps raises serious human rights questions , and their continuation reflects badly on nations that allow them to operate unchecked .
Particular blame must be placed on American state and federal authorities , since at least three RPF programs have operated for years on American soil .
Moreover , the American Internal Revenue Service granted Scientology tax exemption despite what almost certainly are illegal conditions under which RPF inmates must work , study , and live .
Extensive material about RPFs in the United States has existed for years in various court cases , and now most of this information is readily available on the World Wide Web .
German government officials know about the RPF , and almost certainly this knowledge played a major role in the government 's continued opposition to the Scientology organization .
Getting assigned to the RPF is a traumatic event for most people .
Procedurally , what is supposed to happen is that leaders call a hearing , known as a " Committee of Evidence , " to evaluate a person 's performance or attitude .
A former member described this body as " a Scientology trial , where the Committee [ members ] act as prosecutors , judges and jury rolled into one " ( Atack , 1990 : 306 ) .
Committees sometimes obtain evidence against the person from security checks ( called sec checks [ see Kent interview with Young , 1994 : 49 ] ) , which the organization portrays as " Integrity Processing " or " Confessional Auditing , " but which is really a form of interrogation ( Atack , 1990 : 147 ) .
In fact , in 1960 , Hubbard wrote a policy called " Interrogation " about how to use the device known as an e-meter as an interrogation device rather than merely as a spiritual aide in counselling or auditing sessions as the organization represents it to the outside world ( Hubbard , 1960 ) .
Hubbard had used security checks on his followers since 1959 , but the most notorious sec check probably was the " Johannesburg Security Check , " published April 7 , 1961 .
It consisted of over one hundred questions , almost all of which inquire about previous or current participation in a wide range of deviant and criminal acts including spying , kidnapping , murder , drugs , sex , and Communism .
The most revealing ones , however , involved people 's thoughts about Hubbard and his wife , Mary Sue Hubbard .
The sec check specifically asked , " Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about LRH ? , " and " Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about Mary Sue ? "
Not only , therefore , were people forced to reveal personal information about serious transgressions , but also they were forced to reveal the existence of any negative thoughts about the leader or his wife .
One former member - turned critic , Robert Vaughn Young , reported that he was sec-checked for several hours a day for about two weeks ( Kent Interview with Young , 1994 : 50 ) .
An even more severe form of sec check was the " gang bang sec check , " a process that presumably takes its name from group rape ( a slang term for which is gang bang ) .
Gang bang sec checks involve two or more interrogators rapidly firing questions and verbal abuse at a victim who is hooked up to or holding an e-meter .
A brief description of this practice occurs in a legal declaration ( sworn under oath ) by former member Stacy Young .
She declared that her repeated protests about the way that ( the now - current head of Scientology ) David Miscavige treated staff led Miscavige to send her to the RPF in September , 1982 ( S. Young , 1994 : 8 , 65 ) .
The specific incident that triggered her assignment was that Miscavige learned that Young had reacted to his ( alleged ) screaming fits by telling someone that he was " a brutal , tyrannical bully " ( S. Young , 1994 : 65 ) .
In response , Miscavige :
ordered me to submit to what was known as a ' gang bang sec check . '
Two very large , strong men ... locked me in a room and interrogated me for hours .
During the interrogation , they screamed and swore at me .
They accused me of crimes against Scientology .
They demanded that I confess to being an enemy agent ( S. Young , 1994 : 66 ) .
Soon Young found herself in the RPF's ' Running Program , " which involved " running around an orange pole for 12 hours a day " ( S. Young , 1994 : 66 ) .
When Committees of Evidence find Sea Org members guilty of serious crimes , then they send many of them to RPF programs .
Inmates are not sentenced to the programs for specific lengths time .
Instead , they remain in until they complete a rigorous program of hard physical labour , constant verbal abuse from immediate superiors , social isolation , intense co-auditing and sec checking , and study of Hubbard policies and techniques .
A series of policies about the RPF began appearing in January , 1974 when Hubbard was aboard ship , and a few revised versions of them have leaked out of the organization .
One of these early documents revealed the totalistic nature of the program when it said that " [ a ] member of the RPF is a member of the RPF and of nothing outside of it , till released " ( Walker and Webb , 1977 : 3 ) .
Part of the program consisted of hard physical labour -- building structures , cleaning , renovating , garbage disposal , and moving furniture .
Typically work projects of this nature took about ten hours a day , since people were supposed to get " around 7 hours sleep , 5 hours study or auditing , 30 minutes for each meal , and 30 minutes personal hygiene , per day " ( Walker and Webb , 1977 : 4 ) .
They were dark worksuits and were prohibited from speaking ( unless necessary ) with persons outside the RPF , and they ate and slept separate from other Sea Org members ( Walker and Webb , 1977 : 10 ) .
They had to run everywhere they went , and often they had to run extra distances for punishment .
On a ship , running punishments usually meant laps around the deck ( Pignotti , 1997 : 18 - 19 ) .
On land , running punishments sometimes meant running around a pole for hours at a time , often in hot sun ( see Kent Interview with Pignotti , 1997 : 22 ; S. Young , 1994 : 66 ) .
Severe restrictions were placed upon visitation rights with spouses or children ( Walker and Webb , 1977 : 10 ) .
Accounts from former inmates indicate that RPF life can be extremely harsh , degrading , and abusive .
Certainly experiences varied somewhat according to year and location , but Hanna Whitfield 's description of RPF at the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater , Florida in 1978 captures many common elements from other accounts that I have heard and read :
Some of us slept on thin mattresses on the bare cement floor .
Some had crude bunk beds .
There was no place for clothes , so we lived out of suitcases and bags which were kept on bare floors .
Some privacy was maintained by hanging sheets up between bunk beds and between floor mattresses .
The women and men had separate bathrooms and toilets but they were small .
We were not allowed to shower longer than 30 seconds .
We had only to run through the shower and out the other end .
There was no spare time for talk or relaxation .
We awoke at 6:30 A.M. or earlier at times , did hard labor and heavy construction work and cleaning until late afternoon .
After [ a ] quick shower and change of clothing , we had to audit each other and ' rehabilitate ' ourselves until 10:30 P.M. or later each evening .
There were no days off , four weeks a month .
We ate our meals in the garage or at times in the dining rooms AFTER normal meals had ended .
Our food consisted of leftovers from staff .
On occasions which seemed like Christmas , we were able to prepare ourselves fresh meals if leftovers were insufficient ( Whitfield , 1989 : 7 - 8 ) .
A similar , but more passionate , description exists of the Fort Harrison RPF in the account written by a woman using the pseudonym Nefertiti ( 1997 ) , who in turn reproduces excerpts from ten other former Scientologists who related RPF experiences aboard two Scientology ships , FLAG at Clearwater , Florida , Pacific Area Command in Los Angeles , and Happy Valley near Hemet , California .
Certainly the amount of work that RPF members performed varied according to era and circumstances , but in some instances conditions became unbelievably bad .
For example ,
In a California RPF , former inmate Pat reported that her RPF crew " worked shifts of thirty hours at a time " ( Kent Interview with Pat , 1997 : 25 ) .
Her RPF team would " start working in the morning and we would work all night into the next morning and then we worked through the next day until we got our thirty hours and then we'd go to sleep " ( Kent Interview with Pat , 199 : 25 ) .
The most extensive description of the RPF at Scientology 's facility near Hemet , California appears in a sworn declaration by former Sea Org member Andre Tabayoyon ( 1994 ) .
From comments that Bavaria 's Minister of the Interior , Dr. Gunther Beckstein , made in a January 15 , 1997 press release , it is clear that he is familiar with this declaration .
Tabayoyon stated that he spent approximately six years in the RPF during his 21 years in the organization ( A. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 7 , 8 ) .
In the RPF program that he was on beneath Scientology 's Cedars Sinai Hospital building in Los Angeles , he allegedly slept on " a slab inside the vault of the morgue . "
In the RPF in the property near Hemet , he stayed in " the chicken coop dormitory ... which still smelled of chicken coup droppings [ sic ] " ( A. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 18 ; see Kent Interview with Young , 1994 : 20 ) .
While nearly all RPF accounts speak of guards who were posted to prevent people from escaping the program , Tabayoyon reported that the guards at the Gilman Hot Springs facility ( where Sea Org staff lived and an RPF operated ) were armed ( A. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 25 ) .
Indeed , he helped to construct the facility 's security system , which included " the perimeter fence , the ultra razor barriers , the lighting of the perimeter fence , the electronic monitors , the concealed microphones , the ground sensors , the motion sensors and hidden cameras .... "
He also said that he trained guards in the use of force , including the use of weapons , many of which had been purchased with " Church " money and not registered ( A. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 15 , 16 ) .
This facility ( which sometimes is called " Gold " and other times " Hemet " in various documents ) is less than a two hour drive from Los Angeles and Hollywood , and on its property apparently are a number of facilities that Scientology 's celebrities use .
Part of the labour used to build an apartment for Scientologist and actor Tom Cruise allegedly was from the RPF ( A. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 53 ) .
As Tabayoyon himself stated , " [ u ] sing RPFers to renovate and reconstruct Tom Cruise 's personal and exclusive apartment at the Scientology Gold base is equivalent to the use of slave labor for Tom Cruise 's benefit " ( A. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 53 ) .
In one instance , when Cruise 's apartment was damaged by a mud slide , " prison [ i.e. , RPF ] slave labor " were " worked almost around the clock " to repair it ( A. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 53 ) .
More extreme than the RPF is the RPF 's RPF , an institution even described in one of Scientology 's own dictionaries .
According to the dictionary definition , the first inmate sent to the RPF 's RPF was because the person " considered their [ sic ] RPF assignment amusing " ( Hubbard , 1976 : 451 ) .
Various accounts , however , also suggest that people who did not perform according to acceptable RPF standards ended up in this extreme program .
Hubbard succinctly outlined the ten restrictions under which inmates on the RPF 's RPF operated .
Six of the ten were :
segregated from other RPF members with regard to work , messing , berthing , musters and any other common activity .
no pay .
no training .
no auditing .
may only work on mud boxes in the E/R [ engine room ] .
May not work with RPF members .
[ Elsewhere Hubbard identified mud boxes as " those areas in the bilge which collect the mud out of the bilge water " ( Hubbard , 1976 : 341 ) ] .
six hours sleep maximum ( Hubbard , 1976 : 451 ) .
Andre Tabayoyon , who spent 19 days on the RPF 's RPF , summed up the program by saying that it " is designed to totally destroy any individual determinism to not want to do the RPF " ( A. Tabayoyon , 1994 : 9 ) .
Accounts both about people who were on the program , and from inmates of the program itself , are chilling , and they reinforce Tabayoyon 's summation .
Monica Pignotti , for example , spoke to me about her five days in the RPF 's RPF in 1975 .
She related that :
[ A]t that point I was in a horrible depression and I was crying almost all the time all day long and I 'm sure I was in a state where I probably would have been hospitalized if ... any mental health profession had seen me then ' cuz I was severely depressed .
But they sent me to the RPF 's RPF and I was made to go down and clean muck from the bilges .
That was my job all day long was to do that , getting up at four in the morning and -- it was all day long .
And then I was allowed a short meal break to eat by myself and then I had to go right back down there and I had to clean all this sludge out and then paint , paint it ....
[ The person in charge of the RPF's RPF ] would make the prisoners write these essays until they got it right , until they were saying what the group wanted them to say .
So that was where I really snapped -- where I went into this state of complete -- where I did n't feel anything any more after that .
I was completely numbed out and I 'd do whatever they said and I did n't rebel any more after my experience on the RPF .
I stopped rebelling for a while ( Kent Interview with Pignotti , 1997 : 26 ; see Pignotti , 1989 : 28-29 ) .
Nefertiti reported speaking with a woman in her ' thirties on the RPF 's RPF whose ankles were chained together while she was performing a " nasty " job in the basement of the Fort Harrison Hotel in Florida ( Nefertiti , 1997 : 3 ) .
Finally , Dennis Erlich reported that , for the first day or two of his time on the program in the basement at the Fort Harrison , he was locked in a wire cage and had a guard outside the room ( Kent Interview with Erlich , 1997 : 8 ) .
A final word must be said about the RPF , the RPF 's RPF , and children .
Some evidence exists that children may be subject to these programs .
Monica Pignotti , for example , reported to me that she was an RPF inmate along with a twelve year old girl ( Kent Interview with Pignotti , 1997 : 30 ) , and a posting in the < alt.religion.scientology > news group by Steve Jebson stated that " I have seen children on both the RPF and the RPF's RPF " ( Jebson , 1997 : 1 ) .
Finally , a poorly reproduced document from Scientology 's Pacific Area Command ( circa 1989 ) spoke about the " need to re-institute the Children 's RPF " ( Cohee , n.d. ) .
One hardly has to point out that the RPF and the RPF 's RPF are brainwashing programs .
Scientology operates them to break the wills of , and correct deviations of , its most committed members , and then to reformulate them into persons whose personalities directly mimic the organizational mould .
That mould is itself a reflection of Hubbard 's troubled personality .
I am fully aware that many of my social scientific colleagues insist that researchers should restrict using the controversial brainwashing term only to situations where there is incarceration and physical maltreatment ( Anthony , 1990 : 304 ) .
The RPF and the RPF 's RPF meet these criteria .
These two programs also used forced confessions , physical fatigue , intense indoctrination through extended study of the leader 's policies and teachings , humiliation , and fear .
Persons familiar , however , with the early history of Scientology are not surprised to see that Hubbard sanctioned a brainwashing program for his followers , since he almost certainly is the author of a brainwashing manual that Scientology printed and distributed for years beginning in 1955 .
The manual that Scientology distributed was entitled , Brain - Washing [ : ]
A Synthesis of the Russian Textbooks on Psychopolitics ( [ Hubbard ? ] , 1955 ) .
Purported to be an address by the noted Soviet spy , Lavrenti Beria , it was exposed as a fake in 1970 by debunker Morris Kominsky ( 1970 ) .
As Kominsky noted , much of the book was " a vicious attack against the sciences and professions of psychology and psychiatry , as well as against the entire legitimate mental health movement " ( Kominsky , 1970 : 538 ) .
Attacks of this nature remain a central element in Scientology 's secular activities , and one former member - turned - critic was almost certainly correct when he stated that the brainwashing book or manual " [ w ] as secretly authored by L. Ron Hubbard in 1955 .... "
The former member also was absolutely correct about the importance of the brainwashing manual when he concluded that Hubbard " incorporated its methods into his organization in the mid 1960s and beyond " ( Corydon , 1996 : 107 ) .
One thinks automatically of the RPF , but we know for certain that Hubbard had the manual as required reading for members of the Guardian Office ( Anonymous , 1974 ) .
One chapter of the brainwashing book is especially pertinent to understanding Scientology 's contemporary tactics against Germany and its officials .
The organization 's attacks on the national character of the country ; its continual attempts to paint current events in the context of 1930s Nazism ( for example , Freedom Magazine , [ 1996 ? ] ) ; its efforts to discredit current German government officials by linking them to Nazism through ( so I was told ) their older relatives ; and charges that German churches campaign against Scientology for fear of losing members to it ( Church of Scientology International , 1997 : 101 ) ; all seem to have general parallels with tactics advocated in the brainwashing manual .
I will read the relevant passages , but I will do so making similar substitutions of words in the text that Kevin Anderson made in his 1965 report to the Australian Parliament ( Anderson , 1965 : 198-199 ) .
By doing so , Anderson dramatically illustrated his claim that " a great part of the manual is almost a blue print for the propagation of [ S ] cientology " ( Anderson , 1965 : 84 ) .
Whenever the manual says " psychopolitics " or " psychopolitical , " I will say " Scientology . "
I replace " psychopolitician " with " Scientologist , " and I replace " Communist Party Members " with " Sea Org members . "
With these substitutions in mind , I now quote excerpts form Chapter VIII entitled , " Degradation , Shock and Endurance : "
Defamation is the best and foremost weapon of [ Scientologists ] on the broad field .
Continual and constant degradation of national leaders , national institutions , national practices , and national heros must be systematically carried out , but this is the chief function of [ Sea Org Members ] in general , not the Scientologist ( [ Hubbard ? ] , 1955 : 41 ) .
....
The officials of government , students , readers , partakers of entertainment , must all be indoctrinated , by whatever means , into the complete belief that the restless , the ambitious , the natural leaders , are suffering from environmental maladjustments , which can only be healed by recourse to [ Scientology ] operatives in the guise of mental healers .
By thus degrading the general belief in the status of Man , it is relatively simple , with co-operation from economic salients being driven into the country , to drive citizens apart , one from another , to bring about a question of the wisdom of their own government , and to cause them to actively beg for enslavement .
....
As it seems in foreign nations that the church is the most ennobling influence , each and every branch and activity of each and every church must , one way or another , be discredited ....
Thus , there must be no standing belief in the church , and the power of the church must be denied at every hand .
The [ Scientology ] operative , in his programme of degradation , should at all times bring into question any family which is deeply religious , and should any neurosis or insanity be occasioned in that family , to blame and hold responsible their religious connections for the neurotic or psychotic condition .
Religious must be made synonymous with neurosis and psychosis .
People who are deeply religious would be less and less held responsible for their own sanity , and should more and more be relegated to the ministrations of [ Scientology ] operatives .
By perverting the institutions of a nation and bringing about a general degradation , by interfering with the economics of a nation to the degree that privation and depression come about , only minor shocks will be necessary to produce , on the populace as a whole , an obedient reaction or an hysteria ( [ Hubbard ? ] , 1955 : 43 -44 ) .
With only a little imagination , one can see that the brainwashing manual seems to provide an outline for Scientology 's battle plan against Germany .
Through , for example , innumerable publications such as Freedom magazine , Sea Org members and other Scientologists produce a barrage of material that denigrates the nation and its leaders .
German Scientologists are now able to label its political leaders as violators of human rights , thanks in part to criticism that the United States Department of State levelled against the country 's attempts to curb the organization and boycott films starring American Scientologists ( Lippman , 1997 ) .
On the economic front , critics might see events in the Hamburg real estate market as evidence of Scientologists ' attempt to cause what the brainwashing manual called " privation and depression " among apartment renters .
Reportedly Scientologists bought rental properties and turned them overnight into cooperatives .
The chairperson of the Hamburg branch of the German real estate agents association , Peter Landmann , told the New York Times that these Scientologists were " 'using disreputable methods to frighten and coerce the renters into buying them back at high prices ' " ( Whitney , 1994 : A12 ) .
Finally , of course , Scientology continues to blast psychiatry , attempting to link it with both Nazism and current German efforts against it .
Hubbard , or whomever wrote the brainwashing manual 's instructions about how to degrade a country , undoubtedly would be proud of his followers ' public relations successes thus far .
Indeed , from a public relations perspective , Scientology may be winning the battle , at least back in North America .
When , for example , the prestigious New York Review of Books published an article on " Germany vrs. Scientology , " the German reporter ( who writes for the Suddeutsche Zeitung ) strongly implied that government officials were scapegoating Scientology .
His argument seems to be that attacks against the group have become part of a moral panic , when in fact other social issues , such as double - digit unemployment , declining state generosity , tensions over European union , and problems with national identity , should be the real areas of concern ( Joffe , 1997 : 20 ) .
This argument , however , as well as the American State Department human rights criticisms , shows a profound and increasingly inexcusable ignorance of disturbing if not dangerous abuses that occur as routine Scientology policy against many of its members .
Even to concede that Scientology may be a religion to many of its adherents , the basis for German governmental opposition to it has nothing to do with what people believe .
It has everything to do with what German government officials know that the organization does .
Consequently , this presentation concentrated heavily on the organization 's social - psychological assaults on many of its most committed members , and I barely mentioned Scientology 's ideological system .
The assaults that I described are ones that German government officials seem to know about , and with that knowledge they have no choice other than to see Scientology as a threat to the democratic state .
Were officials to grant Scientology religious status , then even more citizens than already now do , would increase their involvement to the point of becoming Sea Org members , and then at least some of them would be subject to the brutal conditions and programs that I described .
With Germany 's unique experiences with both National Socialism and Communism , it is unthinkable that responsible officials would facilitate the operation of a totalitarian organization that throws its members into forced labour and reeducation camps .
One of the tragedies in this debate is that normal Scientologists will feel persecuted and threatened .
These people likely know nothing about RPF conditions , and they genuinely feel that Scientology involvement has benefitted them .
The organization to which they belong , however , appears to be committing serious human rights abuses .
Consequently , I conclude my presentation by highlighting areas of concern raised by examining the United Nations ' 1948 resolution entitled The International Bill of Human Rights ( United Nations , 1996 b ) , and the 1996 International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( United Nations , 1996a ) .
First , Scientology 's procedures involving committees of evidence , sec checking , gang bang sec checking , and the two RPF programs almost certainly violate Articles 9 and 10 of the Bill .
Article 9 protects people against " arbitrary arrest , detention or exile " while article 10 guarantees " a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal , in the determination of his [ sic ] rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him " ( United Nations , 1996 : 23 ) .
Second , Scientology 's punishment of members for merely discussing the merits of Hubbard 's teachings , as well as its invasive probing into people 's thoughts though sec checking , almost certainly violate Articles 18 and 19 of the Bill that deal with both " the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion " and " the right to freedom of opinion and expression " ( United Nations , 1996 : 25 ) .
Third , the various Scientology practices and procedures that I discussed may violate Article 17 of the Bill , which states that " [ n] o one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation " ( United Nations , 1996 : 49 ) .
Fourth , the conditions of the RPF and the RPF 's RPF almost certainly violate Article 7 of the Covenant , which discusses " the right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work ... " ( United Nations , 1996a : 38 ) .
The article specifically identifies fair wages , " [ a ] decent living for themselves and their families ... , [ s ] afe and healthy working conditions ... , and [ r ] est , leisure , and reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay .... " ( United Nations , 1996a : 38 ) .
Indeed , many Sea Org jobs themselves may not meet these reasonable standards of propriety , safety , and fairness .
Fifth and finally , the extreme social psychological assaults and forced confessions that RPF and RPF 's RPF inmates suffer almost certainly violate Article 12 of the Covenant , which recognizes " the right of everyone to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health " ( United Nations , 1996a : 18 ) .
These and probably other serious human rights issues swirl around Scientology programs that have tax exemption and operate within the boundaries of the United States .
With these serious issues in mind , the American human rights criticism of Germany 's opposition to Scientology is the height diplomatic arrogance .
By granting Scientology tax exemption , the United States government is cooperating with an organization that appears to put citizens from around the world at significant mental health and perhaps medical risk .
While in no way do I want my remarks today to be taken as a blanket endorsement of the German government 's rhetoric or tactics , on the battle with Scientology the government has the high moral ground .
Introduction
An Artificial Neural Network is an information processing method that was inspired by the way biological nervous systems function , such as the brain , to process information .
It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements ( neurons ) working in unison to solve specific problems .
Neural Networks have been widely used in " analogous " signal classifications , including handwriting , voice and image recognitions .
Neural network can also be used in computer games .
It enables games with the ability to adaptively learn from player behaviors .
This technique has been used in racing games , such that opponent cars controlled by computers can learn how to drive by human players .
Since a Neural Network requires a considerable number of vector and matrix operations to get results , it is very suitable to be implemented in a parallel programming model and run on Graphics Processing Units ( GPUs ) .
Our goal is to utilize and unleash the power of GPUs to boost the performance of a Neural Network solving handwriting recognition problems .
This project was originally our graphics architecture course project .
We ran on GPU the same Neural Network described by Mike O'Neill in his brilliant article " Neural Network for Recognition of Handwritten Digits " .
About the Neural Network
A Neural Network consists of two basic kinds of elements , neurons and connections .
Neurons connect with each other through connections to form a network .
This is a simplified theory model of the human brain .
A Neural Network often has multiple layers ; neurons of a certain layer connect neurons of the next level in some way .
Every connection between them is assigned with a weight value .
At the beginning , input data are fed into the neurons of the first layer , and by computing the weighted sum of all connected first layer neurons , we can get the neuron value of a second layer neuron and so on .
Finally , we can reach the last layer , which is the output .
All the computations involved in operating a Neural Network are a bunch of dot products .
The secret of a Neural Network is all about weight values .
Right values make it perfect .
However , at the beginning , we do n't know those values .
Therefore , we need to train our network with sample inputs and compare the outcomes with our desired answers .
Some algorithm can take the errors as inputs and modify the network weights .
If patient enough , the Neural Network can be trained to achieve high accuracy .
The neural network we implemented was a 5 layer network called convolutional neural network .
This kind of network is proven to be suitable for recognizing handwritten digits .
For more theoretical details , please check out Mike 's article and the references he has listed .
The first three layers of our neural network consist of several feature maps .
Each of them is shrunken from the previous layer .
Our input is a 29 * 29 image of a digit .
Therefore , we have 29 *29=841 neurons in the first layer .
The second layer is a convolutional layer with 6 feature maps .
Each feature map which is a 13 * 13 image is sampled from the first layer .
Each pixel / neuron in a feature map is a 5 * 5 convolutional kernel of the input layer .
So , there are 13 * 13*6 = 1014 nodes / neurons in this layer , and ( 5 * 5+1 ( bias node ) ) * 6 = 156 weights , 1014 *( 5* 5+1 ) = 26364 connections linking to the first layer .
Layer 3 is also a convolutional layer , but with 50 smaller feature maps .
Each feature map is 5 * 5 in size , and each pixel in these feature maps is a 5 * 5 convolutional kernel of corresponding areas of all 6 feature maps of the previous layer .
There are thus 5 * 5* 50 = 1250 neurons in this layer , ( 5*5+1 ) * 6*50 = 7800 weights , and 1250 * 26 = 32500 connections .
The fourth layer is a fully - connected layer with 100 neurons .
Since it is fully - connected , each of the 100 neurons in the layer is connected to all 1250 neurons in the previous layer .
There are therefore 100 neurons in it , 100 * ( 1250+1 ) = 125100 weights and 100x1251 = 125100 connections .
Layer 5 is the final output layer .
This layer is also a fully - connected layer with 10 units .
Each of the 10 neurons in this layer is connected to all 100 neurons of the previous layer .
There are 10 neurons in Layer 5 , 10 *( 100+1 ) = 1010 weights and 10x101 = 1010 connections .
As you can see , although structurally simple , this Neural Network is a huge data structure .
Previous GPU Implementation
Fast Neural Network Library ( FANN ) has a very simple implementation of Neural Network on GPU with GLSL .
Each neural is represented by a single color channel of a texture pixel .
This network is very specific ; neurons are ranging from 0 to 1 and have an accuracy of only 8 bits .
This implementation takes the advantage of hardware accelerated dot product function to calculate neurons .
Both neurons and weights are carried on texture maps .
This implementation is straightforward and easy , however limited .
First , in our neural network , we require 32 - bit float accuracy for each neuron .
Since our network has five layers , accuracy lost at the first level could be accumulated and alter the final results .
And because it is important that a handwriting recognition system should be sensitive enough to detect slight differences between different inputs , using only 8 bits to represent a neuron is unacceptable .
Secondly , normal Neural Networks map neuron values to the range from 0 to 1 .
However , in our program , the Neural Network which is specifically designed for handwriting recognition has a special activation function mapping each neuron value to the range from - 1 to 1 .
Therefore , if the neuron is represented by a single color value as in FANN library , our neurons will lose accuracy further .
Finally , the FANN method uses a dot product to compute neurons , which is suitable for full connected Neural Networks .
In our implementation , the Neural Network is partially connected .
Computations performed on our Neural Network involve dot products of large vectors .
Our Implementation
Due to all the inconvenience about GLSL mentioned above , we finally choose CUDA .
The reason that the Neural Network is suitable for GPU is that the training and execution of a Neural Network are two separate processes .
Once properly trained , no writing access is required while using a Neural Network .
Therefore there is no synchronization issue that needs to be addressed .
Moreover , neurons on a same network level are completely isolated , such that neuron value computations can achieve highly parallelization .
In our code , weights for the first layer are stored as an array , and those inputs are copied to device .
For each network level , there is a CUDA function handling the computation of neuron values of that level , since parallelism can only be achieved within one level and the connections are different between levels .
The connections of the Neural Network are implicitly defined in CUDA functions with the equations of next level neuron computation .
No explicit connection data structure exists in our code .
This is one main difference between our code and the CPU version by Mike .
For example , each neuron value of the second level is a weighted sum of 25 neurons of the first level and one bias .
The second neuron level is composed of 6 feature maps ; each has a size of 13 * 13 .
We assign a blockID for each feature map and a threadID for each neuron on a feature map .
Every feature map is handled by a block and each pixel on it is dealt with by a thread .
This is the CUDA function that computes the second network layer :
__global__ void executeFirstLayer ( float * Layer1_Neurons_GPU , float * Layer1_Weights_GPU , float * Layer2_Neurons_GPU ) { int blockID=blockIdx.x ; int pixelX=threadIdx.x ; int pixelY=threadIdx.y ; int kernelTemplate [ 25 ] = { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 58 , 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 87 , 88 , 89 , 90 , 91 , 116 , 117 , 118 , 119 , 120 } ; int weightBegin=blockID * 26 ; int windowX=pixelX * 2 ; int windowY=pixelY * 2 ; float result=
0 ; result+=Layer1_Weights_GPU[weightBegin ] ; ++weightBegin ; for ( int i= 0 ;i< 25 ;++i ) { result +=Layer1_Neurons_GPU
[ windowY*29+windowX+kernelTemplate[i ]]* Layer1_Weights_GPU[weightBegin+i ] ; } result= ( 1 . 7159 * tanhf ( 0 . 66666667 * result ) ) ; Layer2_Neurons_GPU [ 13 * 13 * blockID+pixelY *13+pixelX ] =result ; }
All other levels are computed the same way ; the only difference is the equation of calculating neurons .
The main program first transfers all the input data to GPU and then calls each CUDA function in order and finally gets the answer .
The user interface is a separate program using C#. Users can draw a digit with the mouse on the input pad , the program then generates a 29 * 29 image and calls the kernel Neural Network program .
The kernel , as described above , will read the input image and feed it into our Neural Network .
Results are also returned with files and then read back by the user interface .
Here is a screenshot .
After drawing a digit , we can get all the 10 neuron values of the last network layer .
The index of the maximum neuron value is the most possible digit .
We shade candidates with different depth of red colors according to their possibilities .
On the right , the user interface will print out feature maps of the first three layers .
Note that C# under Windows XP has a resolution issue .
We tested our program under 120dpi .
A 96dpi resolution setting could shift the input image around , so that the accuracy is badly affected .
Result
Accuracy
No training part is included in our GPU implementation .
We use Mike ’s code to train all the weights and cached them with files .
Our Neural Network can achieve a 95 % accuracy .
The database we used to train the network is called MNIST containing 60000 handwriting examples from different people .
It is reported by Dr. LeCun that this network can converge after around 25 times of training .
This number is confirmed by our test .
We achieved only around 1400 miss - recognition samples out of 60000 inputs .
Also note that there is a bug in Mike 's code .
This is the corrected code for initializing the second layer :
for ( fm= 0 ; fm < 50 ; ++fm ) { for ( ii= 0 ; ii < 5 ; ++ii ) { for ( jj= 0 ; jj < 5 ; ++jj ) { iNumWeight = fm * 156 ; NNNeuron& n = *( pLayer ->m_Neurons [ jj + ii* 5 + fm* 25 ] ) ; n. AddConnection ( ULONG_MAX , iNumWeight ++ ) ; for ( kk= 0 ; kk < 25 ; ++kk ) { n. AddConnection ( 2 * jj + 26 * ii + kernelTemplate2[kk ] , iNumWeight ++ ) ; n. AddConnection ( 169 + 2 * jj + 26 * ii + kernelTemplate2[kk ] , iNumWeight ++ ) ; n. AddConnection ( 338 + 2 * jj + 26 * ii + kernelTemplate2[kk ] , iNumWeight ++ ) ; n. AddConnection ( 507 + 2 * jj + 26 * ii + kernelTemplate2[kk ] , iNumWeight ++ ) ; n. AddConnection ( 676 + 2 * jj + 26 * ii + kernelTemplate2[kk ] , iNumWeight ++ ) ; n. AddConnection ( 845 + 2 * jj + 26 * ii + kernelTemplate2[kk ] , iNumWeight ++ ) ; } } } }
Please refer to this for the details about this bug .
Our GPU implementation is based on the correct version , however there is n't too much difference in terms of accuracy .
Performance
The major reason for using GPU to compute Neural Network is to achieve robustness .
The outcome is promising compared to CPU implementation .
As shown in the table above , the executing time of GPU version , EmuRelease version and CPU version running on one single input sample is compared .
The GPU version speeds up by 270 times compared to CPU version and 516.6 times compared to EmuRelease version .
To be more accurate , we also considered the IO time consumption of the GPU version .
As we can see , even when the IO time is considered , our method is 10 times faster .
And in practical use , weight values need only be loaded into the device once .
History
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA is a remarkable thing .
Itself the remnant of a strange evolutionary event ( the merger of an ancient bacterium with the cell ancestral to all plant and animal life ) , it also carries the imprint of more recent evolution .
In many species , humans included , it passes only from mother to child .
No paternal genes get mixed into it .
That makes it easy to see when particular genetic mutations happened , and thus to construct a human family tree .
The branches of that tree are now well studied .
Humans started in Africa , spread to Asia around 60,000 years ago , thence to Australia 50,000 years ago , Europe 35,000 years ago and America 15,000 years ago .
What have not been so well examined , though , are the tree 's African roots .
The genetic diversity of Africans probably exceeds that of the rest of the world put together .
But the way that diversity evolved is unclear .
A study carried out under the auspices of the Genographic Project , based in Washington , DC , and just published in the American Journal of Human Genetics , goes some way towards correcting this oversight .
The study 's researchers , led by Doron Behar of the Rambam Medical Centre in Haifa and Spencer Wells of America 's National Geographic Society , have used the mitochondrial DNA of more than 600 living Africans to show how genetic diversity has developed in Africa .
In doing so , they have shed light on how modern man spread around his home continent long before he took the first , tentative steps into a bigger , wider world .
By the drought divided
The team paid particular attention to samples taken from the Khoi and San people of southern Africa .
These people , known colloquially as bushmen , traditionally make their livings by hunting and gathering .
Indeed , their way of life is thought by many anthropologists to resemble quite closely that of pre-agricultural people throughout the world .
Comparing Khoi and San DNA with that of other Africans shows that the first big split in Homo sapiens happened shortly after the species emerged , 200,000 years ago .
Most people now alive are on one side of that split .
Most bushmen are on the other .
The consortium 's analysis of which DNA “ matrilines ” are found where suggests that for much of its history the species was divided into two isolated populations , one in eastern Africa and one in the south of the continent , that were defined by this split .
However , few other matrilineal splits from the first 100,000 years of the species 's history have survived to the present day .
This suggests the early human population was tiny ( so the opportunities for new matrilines to evolve in the first place were limited ) and reinforces the idea that Homo sapiens may have come close to extinction ( eliminating some matrilines that did previously exist ) .
Indeed , there may , at one point , have been as few as 2,000 people left to carry humanity forward .
This shrinkage coincides with a period of prolonged drought in eastern Africa , and was probably caused by it .
The end of the drought , however , was followed by the appearance of many new matrilines that survive to the present day .
The researchers estimate that by 60,000 - 70,000 years ago , the period when the exodus that populated the rest of the world happened , as many as 40 such groups were flourishing in Africa — though that migration involved only two of these groups .
The African matrilines , however , seem to have remained isolated from each other for tens of millennia after the exodus .
It was not until 40,000 years ago that they began to re-establish conjugal relations , possibly as a result of the technological revolution of the Late Stone Age , which yielded new and more finely crafted tools .
Only the bushmen seem to have missed out on this panmictic party .
They were left alone until a few hundred years ago , when their homelands were invaded from the north by other Africans and from the south by Europeans .
Panmixis thus came full circle .
And that particular party was certainly not a happy one .

AS IF collapsing prices were not enough , American mortgage firms now have to cope with home rage .
Borrowers vent their fury on the system that is repossessing their properties by smashing holes in walls and tipping paint over living - room carpets .
Something similar is going on in the house finance built .
Faith in open markets has been poisoned by a crisis that has spread from one asset to the next .
First there was disbelief and denial .
Then fear .
Now comes anger .
For three decades , public policy has been dominated by the power of markets — flexible and resilient , harnessing self - interest for the public good , and better than any planner - in - chief .
Nowhere are markets deeper and more liquid than in modern finance .
But finance has stumbled and there are growing calls from all sides for bold re-regulation .
New rules became inevitable the moment the Federal Reserve rescued Bear Stearns and pledged to lend to other Wall Street banks .
If taxpayers are required to bail out investment banks , the governments need to impose tighter limits on the risks those banks can take .
This week Hank Paulson , America 's treasury secretary , unveiled a longer - term plan to deal with this and other weaknesses in America 's regulatory system ( see article ) ; and next week the G7 finance ministers will meet in Washington , DC , where they will discuss a report on the crisis by the Financial Stability Forum .
It is natural and right that regulators should seek to learn lessons .
The credit crisis will damage not just the reputation of the financial system but also the lives of those who lose their houses , businesses and jobs as a result of it .
But before governments set about reforming financial regulation , they need both to be clear about the causes of the crisis and to understand just how little regulators can achieve .
Arm 's - length finance
The history of financial markets is not a stable one .
They have imploded every decade or so , whether because French and Spanish kings reneged on their debt in the 16th century or because speculators inflated railway stock in the 19th century .
But this crisis is unusually shocking , if only because the mild business cycle and the fast pace of world economic growth in recent years had lulled people into a false sense of security .
The view that the only sensible response to the 21st century 's first serious financial crisis is a wholesale reform of the system is now gaining ground .
Josef Ackermann , über - capitalist and chief executive of Deutsche Bank , summed it up in a call for governments to step in : “ I no longer believe in the market 's self - healing power . ”
The implication is that , if the market cannot heal the wounds it sustains as a result of its own risky behaviour , then it must be discouraged from taking such risks in the first place .
But there are two reasons to hesitate before plunging headlong into a purge of the system .
First , finance was not solely to blame for the crisis .
Lax monetary policy also played a starring role .
Low interest rates boosted the prices of assets , especially of housing , which in turn fed into complex debt securities .
This created a spiral of debt that is only now being unwound .
True , monetary policy is too blunt a tool to manage asset prices with , but , as the IMF now says , central banks in economies with deep mortgage markets should in future lean against the wind when house prices are rising fast .
The second reason to hesitate is that bold re-regulation could damage the very economies it is designed to protect .
At times like this , the temptation is for tighter controls to rein in risk - takers , so that those regular , painful crashes could be avoided .
It is an honourable aim , but a mistaken one .
The inevitable crash
Finance is a brain for matching labour to capital , for allowing savers and borrowers to defer consumption or bring it forward , for enabling people to share , and trade , risks .
The smarter the system is , the better it will do that .
A poorly functioning system will back wasteful schemes and shun worthy ones , trap people in the present , heap risk on them and slow economic growth .
This puts finance in a dilemma .
A sophisticated and innovative financial system is susceptible to destructive booms ; but a simple , tightly regulated one will condemn an economy to grow slowly .
The tempting answer is to try to wriggle free from the dilemma with a compromise that would permit innovation but exert just enough control to squeeze out financial failure .
It is a nice idea ; but it is a fantasy .
The experience of the past year is an object lesson in the limited power of regulators .
Just look at their mistakes .
Before the crisis , hedge funds were regarded with suspicion as vulnerable and irresponsible .
But , with a few notable exceptions , they have weathered the storm less as culprits than as victims .
Instead , the system 's own safety features turned out to be its weakest points .
The copper bottom fell out of AAA bonds when housing markets failed to do what the rating agencies had expected .
Banks avoided rules requiring them to put aside capital , by warehousing vast sums off - balance sheet with disastrous results .
It would be convenient to blame the regulators for all that , but the system is stacked against them .
They are paid less than those they oversee .
They know less , they may be less able , they think like the financial herd , and they are shackled by politics .
In an open economy , business can escape a regulatory squeeze in one country by skipping offshore .
Once a bubble is inflating many factors conspire to discourage a regulator from pricking it .
And even if you could put all that right , regulators would still fail , because of the nature of finance itself .
Financial progress is about learning to deal with strangers in more complex ways .
The village moneylender , limited by his need to know those he did business with , was gradually superseded by ever - broader impersonal markets that can cheaply mobilise colossal sums and sell more complex products .
The remarkable thing is not that finance suffers from booms and busts , but that it works at all .
People who would not dream of lending £ 1,000 to that nice family three doors down routinely hand over their life savings to strangers in a South Korean chaebol or an Atlantan start - up .
It all depends on trust .
Regulators cannot know how trust will ebb and flow as new markets develop the experience and practice they need to work better .
They therefore cannot predict the peril of new ideas .
They have to let new markets develop , or stifle them .
The system learns — dangerous junk bonds are reborn as respectable high - yield debt ; bankers will now be scared of extreme leverage — but it is delicate , as the world learned last summer .
The regulator is condemned to muddle through .
The notion that the world can just regulate its way out of crises is thus an illusion .
Rather , crisis is the price of innovation , so governments face a choice .
They can embrace new financial ideas by keeping markets open .
Regulation will be light , but there will be busts .
The state will sometimes have to clear up and regulation must be about cure as well as prevention .
Or governments can aim for safety and opt for dumbed - down financial systems that hobble their economies and deprive their people of the benefits of faster growth .
And even then a crisis may strike .

When you care enough to fake your compassion .
From the Associated Press :
Hillary Rodham Clinton , a former first lady who has n’t driven a car or pumped gas in many years because of Secret Service restrictions , joined a blue - collar worker at a filling station Wednesday to illustrate how the high price of gasoline is squeezing consumers .
The Democratic presidential candidate and sheet metal worker Jason Wilfing , 33 , pulled into the station in a large white Ford 250 pickup truck , Clinton riding shotgun .
Never mind that it was n’t even Wilfing ’s truck — he had borrowed his boss ’s larger vehicle to accommodate Clinton ’s security agent and personal assistant , who rode in the back .
Trailing Wilfing and Clinton was a Secret Service motorcade consisting of six gas - guzzling Suburbans , two squad cars and a green SUV bearing photographers and TV cameras .
Several other reporters and cameramen stood shivering in unseasonably cold temperatures , ready to capture the multi-vehicle arrival .
The Daily Journal 's Tuesday edition ( not linkable ) reports that Troll Tracker author Rick Frenkel , and his employer Cisco , have been sued for defamation by two East Texas attorneys who are players in that district 's patent litigation scene , Eric Albritton and T. John Ward , Jr .
T. John " Johnny " Ward , Jr. is a Texas lawyer who has filed a large number of patent infringement lawsuits in recent years .
Between January and mid-October of 2007 , his name was attached to 54 separate lawsuits by my count ; in all but four , he represented the plaintiff .
He is also , as I reported in October , the son of Judge T. John Ward , the judge who is largely responsible for making the Eastern District of Texas a hotspot for patent litigation .
I have n't yet read the complaints .
But I did re-read a copy of the Oct. 17 , 2007 post two October posts that apparently inspired the lawsuits .
( that 's a small assumption on my part -- but it 's one of only a few posts that mentions Cisco and the only one I know of that mentions both Cisco and Ward & Albritton , and Craig Anderson 's DJ story says the post is from October . )
The Oct. 17 post is titled " Troll Jumps the Gun , Sues Cisco Too Early , " and alleges that Ward & Albritton filed an amended complaint solely to change the filing date on a lawsuit where Cisco was a defendant .
The 10/17/08 Troll Tracker post begins :
Well , I knew the day would come .
I 'm getting my troll news from Dennis Crouch now .
According to Dennis , a company called ESN sued Cisco for patent infringement on October 15th , while the patent did not issue until October 16th .
I looked , and ESN appears to be a shell entity managed by the President and CEO of DirectAdvice , an online financial website .
And , yes , he 's a lawyer .
He clerked for a federal judge in Connecticut , and was an attorney at Day , Berry & Howard .
Now he 's suing Cisco on behalf of a non-practicing entity .
I asked myself , can ESN do this ?
I would think that the court would lack subject matter jurisdiction , since ESN owned no property right at the time of the lawsuit , and the passage of time should not cure that .
And , in fact , I was right :
( he goes on .. )
Of course , Frenkel works for Cisco , as we now all know .
So it 's unlikely that he was actually , as he says , " getting [ his ] troll news from Dennis Crouch now . "
I 'd guess he was well aware of the ESN lawsuit .
Still , he was careful to write about it after Patently - O author Crouch , who reported the same basic facts : that the ESN v. Cisco patent infringement lawsuit was filed on 10/15/2007 , a day before the patent in question was actually issued , thus " jumping the gun . "
Crouch did n't mention the amended complaint , which had n't yet been filed .
In this subsequent motion , Ward and Albritton say they filed the ESN v. Cisco lawsuit at 12:01 am Central Time on 10/16 , and that Cisco filed suit in Connecticut ten and a half hours later , at 11:32 am EST 10 /16 .
They insisted the case should be kept in Texas . , but then apparently changed their minds -- they stipulated to dismissal on Nov. 2 .
The PACER entry does list 10/15/07 as the date he lawsuit was filed , but the first document -- the complaint -- is listed as being filed on 10/16 .
Back to the Troll Tracker 10 / 17 post :
One other interesting tidbit : Cisco appeared to pick up on this , very quickly .
Cisco filed a declaratory judgment action ( in Connecticut ) yesterday , the day after ESN filed its null complaint .
Since Cisco 's lawsuit was filed after the patent issued , it should stick in Connecticut .
Perhaps realizing their fatal flaw ( as a couple of other bloggers / news items have pointed out ) , ESN ( represented by Chicago firm McAndrews Held & Malloy and local counsel Eric Albritton and T. Johnny Ward ) filed an amended complaint in Texarkana today - amending to change absolutely nothing at all , by the way , except the filing date of the complaint .
Survey says ?
XXXXXX ( insert " Family Feud " sound here ) .
Sorry , ESN .
You 're on your way to New Haven .
Wonder how Johnny Ward will play there ?
And how will a Silicon Valley lawyer who referred to East Texas as a " Banana Republic " play in Longview ?
Albritton and Ward Jr. have probably hauled enough Californians into court to know the answer to that one .
UPDATE : A Cisco spokesperson asked me to add their statement on this issue :
" The parties have mutually agreed to make no comment on the lawsuit in question at this time .
That said , we would like to underscore that the comments made in the employee 's personal blog represented his own opinions and several of his comments are not consistent with Cisco 's views .
We continue to have high regard for the judiciary of the Eastern District of Texas and confidence in the integrity of its judges . "
I should also add that the only place I have seen the " Banana Republic " comment thus far is in today 's Daily Journal .
Craig Anderson writes : " In the October posts at issue in the complaints , Frenkel accused the court of conspiring with the company , on whose behalf the Texas lawyers had filed the patent infringement lawsuit at issue , and referred to the court as ' the Banana Republic of East Texas . ' "
It does not appear in my version of the TT posts , which were saved on Feb. 25 .
But there is a notation that indicates the October 18 post was edited later .
I may post up relevant portions of other posts at a later date , but I 'm going to hold off until I 'm clear on what the accusations are .
UPDATE again :
This post has gotten a lot of attention .
( Ca n't read Troll Tracker , work sucks , what 're you going to do ? )
I 'll write more on this soon .
Meanwhile my colleague Zusha Elinson at The Recorder has a bit more on Cisco and Troll Tracker here .
Warner Music Group has sued SeeqPod ( complaint , 500k PDF ) , a " Web 2.0 " music search engine ( combined with embedable playlists , etc , etc ) that has been gaining in popularity in recent months .
This is the latest in a string of lawsuits against Web 2.0 companies .
Together , the suits represent an attack by the entertainment industry on the DMCA safe harbors that protect hosting services and search engines .
Other similar cases have been filed against YouTube , MP3Tunes.com , Veoh , PornoTube , and Divx / Stage 6 .
The SeeqPod case is different , however , because it is among the first that directly tests how copyright law applies to search engines .
Despite the success of search engines like Yahoo and Google , there has been remarkably little case law developed on the copyright front .
Part of the reason is because Congress stepped in with the DMCA safe harbors in 1998 , creating some degree of certainty where the background legal concepts ( e.g. , contributory infringement ) did not .
In addition , by endorsing a notice - and - takedown regime , the DMCA safe harbors created a solution for many copyright owners that is cheaper than litigation .
But now , as search engines become more specialized and capable , certain copyright owners have become increasingly dissatisfied with the notice - and - takedown bargain struck in the DMCA .
That 's what these lawsuits are really about -- the defendants are complying with the letter of the law , but copyright owners are now trying to change the rules in court .
Of course , the SeeqPod case may settle ( as a similar case brought by Warner against iMeem did ) .
But the copyright issues will not be going away anytime soon ( in particular , keep your eye on the remand in the Perfect 10 v. Google case , where the DMCA safe harbor issues may take center stage ) .
UPDATE : LA Times reporter Jon Healey has an interesting post about the case over at his Bit Player blog , suggesting that SeeqPod is unfairly trying to evade royalty obligations that its competitors must pay .
We spar more over this in the comments over there .
A handful of soil is a lot like a banana , strawberry and apple smoothie : Blended all together , it is hard to tell what 's in there , especially if you have never tasted the fruits before .
But when you look at soil 's organic carbon closely , it has an incredible variety of known compounds .
And looking closely is exactly what Cornell researchers have done for the first time -- at a scale of 50 nanometers ( 1 nanometer equals the width of three silicon atoms ) .
Until now , handfuls of soil humus ( or the organic component of soil , formed by the decomposition of leaves and other plant material by soil microorganisms ) looked remarkably similar .
According to a study published in the April issue of Nature Geoscience , knowing the structure and detailed composition of soil carbon could provide a better understanding of the chemical processes that cycle organic matter in soil .
For example , the research may help scientists understand what happens when materials in the soil get wet , warm or cool and how soils sequester carbon , which has implications for climate change .
" There is this incredible nanoscale heterogeneity of organic matter in terms of soil , " said Johannes Lehmann , a Cornell associate professor of crop and soil sciences and lead author of the study .
" None of these compounds that you can see on a nanoscale level looks anything close to the sum of the entire organic matter . "
The soil measurements ( actually , images produced by a highly focused X - ray beam ) were made at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory using an X - ray spectromicroscopy method developed by physicists at the State University of New York , Stony Brook .
The method allowed the researchers to identify forms of organic carbon in the samples .
While the composition of organic carbon in soils from North America , Panama , Brazil , Kenya or New Zealand proved remarkably similar within each sample , the researchers found that within spaces separated by mere micrometers , soils from any of these locations showed striking variation in their compositions .
For example , the compounds that " hang on the right and left of a clay mineral may be completely different , " said Lehmann .
The researchers were also able to identify the origins of some of the nano - sized compounds , determining that some of them , for example , were microbe excretions and decomposed leaves .
The researchers also recognized patterns of where types of compounds are likely to be found at the nanoscale .
" Now we can start locating certain compounds , " Lehmann said .
" We find black carbon as distinct particles in pores , whereas we find microbial products smeared around surfaces of minerals . "
The method now allows researchers to break soil down , separate compounds , conduct experiments on individual compounds and better understand the interactions , Lehmann said .

The research was funded by the National Science Foundation .
“ A few years ago , politics was definitely not a cool thing to be into , ” said Mr. Finesurrey , a sophomore and an Obama supporter at the University of Wisconsin whom I found in the process of researching this column ( translation : he ’s a friend of my daughter ) .
“ You walk into a house full of students and CNN is on .
People who do it are not looked upon as nerdy . ”
Politics is n’t just the B.M.O.C. , but its own wingman , too .
“ It used to be that you never discussed politics on the first date , ” he said .
“ Now there is nothing else to talk about . ”
The news media have complained for years about this demographic : they do n’t read newspapers , they do n’t watch news on television , they do n’t care about politics .
But maybe the news gave up on them , not the other way around .
“ Young people are being paid attention to this time around and they have responded in kind , both in terms of politics and news about politics , ” said Dhavan V. Shah , a journalism professor at the University of Wisconsin .
“ Whether the election coverage can translate into sustained regular attention from younger viewers depends on what happens .
If they are staked in what happens , they will continue to follow the news . ”
Who let all these kids in ?
Not the news executives , who do n’t  and should n’t  take credit for the huge influx of young viewers .
There is , after all , no substitute for great casting and it ’s hard to beat a cadre of candidates that includes a war hero , a former first lady and a first - term senator who happens to be black .
The cable news outlets are all conscious that new , younger eyes are on them .
They may not know who John King of CNN is , but they recognize the technology behind the giant iPod - like device that allows him to parse information at the flick of a finger .
David Bohrman , the executive producer of CNN ’s political coverage , found the device at a spy convention .
“ Maybe I should be thinking about the younger viewer more , but we are just trying to come up with a program that gives our audience a clear picture of what is going on , and the graphic display is part of that , ” Mr. Bohrman said .
But he added , “ I was shocked when I saw the demographic breakdown on our Democratic debate in Los Angeles and saw that there were over a million people 18 to 34 watching .
I find that very reassuring . ”
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
almost four years ago , when oil was trading at around $ 40 a barrel , Paul Roberts wrote a story for Mother Jones on a bleak scenario gaining currency among energy insiders , but not yet in the mainstream consciousness : peak oil , basically the notion that the world ’s petroleum resources are nearing exhaustion .
If the theory held true , Roberts warned , oil prices could soon leap to “ perhaps as high as $ 100 per barrel — a disaster if we do n’t have a cost - effective alternative fuel or technology in place . ”
Welcome to the disaster : $ 100 - a - barrel oil is in the rearview mirror , and no cost - effective ( or even cost - prohibitive ) alternative has emerged .
The most dire consequences of this failing — hurricanes , drought , extinction — are occurring far more rapidly than even Slideshow Al could have predicted four years ago .
And then there ’s the war .
It ’s easy enough to blame Dick Cheney , Big Oil , Detroit — all of whom have done their part in obstructing progress .
But their chicanery distracts us from the far greater problem , one that , unfortunately , comes down to Organic Chemistry 101 .
Every technological advance of the last 150 years has been powered by a unique , extremely energy - dense , but finite — and , as it turns out , planet - killing — source of fuel .
Switching away from fossil energy requires an economic and social transformation at least as great as the Industrial Revolution .
And we have to build this new economy on the fumes of the old , hoping that we do n’t run out of gas , or ice caps , before we get there .
As Roberts points out in this special issue on energy , if we sit on our hands or let the process be hijacked by vested interests , “ there may not be enough crude left in the ground to fuel a second try . ”
This change will be painful .
Building a new energy economy will require enormous government and private investment .
It will involve massive workforce upheaval and possibly physical dislocation .
The conservation measures demanded will make victory gardens or Jimmy Carter donning a sweater look like three - day diets .
The last time we took such issues seriously , in Carter ’s day , it was called an energy crisis .
Thermostats were turned down across the land , and we went into R&D overdrive .
And that crisis was only about the price of oil — which topped out at all of $ 78 in today ’s dollars .
Few were talking about global warming or blood for oil .
Today ’s energy crisis is on a different scale .
We ’re reliant on an ever - more dubious cast of characters to provide us power .
And if you think the mortgage meltdown is troubling , wait till the markets discover the real price of carbon and realize that our entire economy is , essentially , built on a planetary accounting fraud .
Greenhouse gases , geology , and geo­politics give us no choice but to change our ways .
The truth is , that change has already begun .
Just as we ’ve gone , in the space of a few years , from debating the validity of climate change to being confronted daily with the rapidity of glacial melting , so too will the shift to a postfossil economy , now largely imperceptible , soon be painfully evident .
We can — as we did when confronted with the Great Depression or World War II — overhaul our society and economy and emerge stronger , or we can get swamped by change , watching helplessly as others ride the wave of postcarbon innovation .
Will we be Chrysler or Toyota ?
What we ca n’t bank on is that some geek in Silicon Valley will , on her own , come up with the perfect solution .
Nor will the treasured fixes of the left — solar panels on every roof , banning Hummers , forgoing imported tomatoes — be sufficient .
The questions we face are on the order of :
Are you willing to consider a nuclear plant in your back yard ?
If not your yard , whose ?
And if not a reactor , how about damming a bucolic river , or windmills that ruin a cherished view ?
What new regulations and taxes do we need to kick - start the transformation ?
Forcing the nation to confront such questions is the most critical task our next president faces — more important than resolving the war , bolstering the economy , or fixing health care .
As Senator Richard Lugar ( R - Ind . ) has warned , the president will have advisers whispering that she or he “ can appear forward - looking on energy with a few carefully chosen initiatives ….
without asking for sacrifices or risking the possible failure of a more controversial energy policy . ”
We are guaranteed better leadership than Bush : John McCain introduced the first carbon cap - and - trade bill , and both Clinton and Obama have presented solid , at times groundbreaking , energy plans .
But better is n’t good enough .
We need someone who recognizes the urgency and enormity of the task at hand , who wo n’t fall for bromides like “ energy independence ” or “ clean coal , ” and , most of all , who can shock the rest of us out of our complacency and ask for sacrifices .
Let ’s hope that kind of change is in the offing .
Called Infinity , this amazing piece of work is basically a “ seamless space - to - surface engine that is being independently developed . ”

“. . . they [ the majority of Americans ] shall come to realize what I now realize … that the 9/11 Truth Movement are the real patriots in 21st century America ! "
-- Steve Alten , New York Times Best Selling Novelist ( author of “ The Shell Game ” ) www.TheShellGame.net
There is a visceral anger building as Americans watch in horror as their intelligence is insulted by the sham called mainstream media .
A revolution is beginning to occur , my friends .
They see the Kucinich , Cynthia McKinney , Mike Gravel , and Ron Paul type truth tellers being treated increasingly rudely , even by so called “ progressive ” media they throw to us like a bone to make us think that we have “ alternative ” voices , who are fed by the same military industrial corporate masters .
The fever , the season of our discontent taking form as the YouTube revolution , is even on rare occasion beginning to spill over into mainstream media .
Although a military industrial stranglehold on truth exists in owners of corporate media , the rank and file people working for these soulless corporations must be feeling the strain .
Occasionally truth gets out .
Truth and the hunger for it is beginning to permeate popular culture in many ways .
A Tsunami is building .
Read on to see the pattern .
==================================
Yesterday Bill Clinton was confronted by a 9/11 truth activist , and it is on ABCs website at :
Hours after Obama , Bill Clinton rallies supporters for wife Hillary 's campaign
/
Although , the former president 's speech got off to a rocky start after a front row heckler 's yells about 9/11 being an inside job forced Clinton to engage him in a passionate exchange
. . .
==================================
Just today on 911 Blogger.com videos were posted of main player neo -con criminals being confronted by people sick and tired of the corporate Skeptic ’s Magazine , Popular Mechanics , History Channel , propaganda around the 9/11 attacks , and their shameless smear of anyone questioning the problems with the official 9/11 story .
A revolution is occurring and it IS being televised .
Below are videos just posted TODAY on 911 blogger.com of exciting confrontations with lie tellers who are collapsing under the strain , incapable of coherent argument when not protected by the hall of mirrors known as corporate media , editing , censors , etc .
Thank you particularly WeAreChange for your courage , brilliance , and dogged patriotism and insatiable hunger for truth .

Well , considering the question of judgement that quickly springs to mind after considering his choice of which candidate to back and advise , Frum better get his Neo - Con game up if he is to be a Republican Machiavelli .
These keep distracting me , so I want to put them here .
Sen .
Obama is glossing over problems and pretending they do n't exist .
No he is n't .
Listen to him .
He 'll describe any policy problem you choose thoroughly and precisely .
He understands the causes and effects .
But that 's not where his attention is , re-hashing problems and figuring out what was unfair when .
Past unfairness gets treated by a full airing , by listening and acknowledgement , and it informs our choice of solutions .
But it does n’t stop us from doing something that would work and offers gains to all parties .
When Sen . Obama talks about moving forward , he is n’t glossing over the past or pretending that problems do n’t exist .
He just wants to fix them the only place they can be fixed , from here on out .
Sen .
Obama 's pretty words and speech - making are n't a plan .
Y'all .
You can read Sen .
Obama 's policy plans in his policy statements .
By most accounts , they 're solid and much the same as Sen. Clinton 's or Edward's .
But that 's not what you mean .
You 're all , " hope " and " change " do n't happen because of pretty speeches .
People keep saying that he is being airy - fairy , head in the clouds , buy the world a Coke and sing in harmony .
He ’s not .
He is methodically following the mediation playbook to address the real problems .
It only sounds abstract to you because you are n't familiar with the elements of mediation and you have n’t seen it work .
But I have .
It is n't that I have secret insight into this guy .
Anyone who is trained in mediation sees each techique he uses .
Active listening is where you say the emotion and content of both sides back to them .
Y'all were all " ooooooooh , what juju did he use in his race speech ? ! " and I was like , active listening .
Refusing to demonize people .
Believing that we will live up to the better sides of ourselves .
Offering a vision that is better than what people can get without mediation is the heart of his campaign .
His emphasis on " what works " .
He himself is not magic .
He is a skilled practioner of an approach that has a ton of power to resolve problems .
If you knew that approach , everything he does would look familiar to you .
It is cruel of him to offer a hope that does n't exist .
Dude .
It better exist .
Some big scary stuff is coming our way .
The rest of the recession .
Bringing our troops home from war .
Climate change .
Rising costs of living .
The persistent effects of racism .
Three trillion dollars in household debt .
The war debt .
We get to deal with these simultaneously .
That 's gonna be awesome .
Those are coming and they will be resolved by meeting them and solving them , or they 'll be resolved by our people living in poverty .
There had better be hope .
That brings me to thoughts on pragmatism .
It seems to me that there are a couple different places to be pragmatic .
Some people say that pragmatism is admitting that something wo n't work .
Or they accuse me of hopeless idealism , refusing to be pragmatic .
This surprises me , because I think I have plenty realistic assessment of what things are really like .
Then I figured out that I am pragmatic at a later stage in the game .
For me , the first step is a decision that the problem is solvable .
This IS solvable , so what will the solution require ?
That 's where the pragmatism comes in .
OK , for us to solve climate change will simply require that our population rapidly understand science , decide to change their individual choices of convenience , re-design the American dream , spend a trillion dollars adapting and mitigating our infrastructure and stop treating the natural world as something to dominate .
Cool .
Is that all ?
Oh wait !
Develop clean cheap energy , too .
It is n't that I have unrealistic ideas about what solving the problem will take .
I know perfectly well .
It is just that I 've skipped the step where people say it can't work .
It has to work , because not - working will suck worse .
Bad as the solution is , the problem really is worse .
So I do n't want to hear that kind of " pragmatism " .
I want to hear how we 're going make the next steps happen .
I 'm sure I had more .
But I 'm also sure you 've had enough .
The withdrawal of US troops is a key issue in the presidential campaign Democratic opponents of US President George W Bush have accused him of putting off tough decisions on Iraq until after the presidential elections .
The criticism follows Mr Bush 's announcement of a " major strategic shift " that includes suspending troop withdrawals after July .
He says this would allow senior commander General David Petraeus to assess the next step in Iraq .
But his opponents say the people want answers from this president , now .
The decision to halt withdrawals means the US presence in Iraq is likely to last well beyond January 2009 , when Mr Bush will leave office and whoever wins the November elections will take over .
He is just dragging this out so he can put it at the doorstep of the new president of the United States
Nancy Pelosi
Democratic Speaker of the House The Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said the president had failed to answer key questions , including what conditions would allow troops to come home .
" The president has taken us into a failed war , he 's taken us deeply into debt and that debt is taking us into recession , " she said .
" We need some answers from the president . "
Graph of US troops and military deaths
By July , the US presence in Iraq should be reduced from 20 brigades to 15 - leaving about 140,000 troops in the country , about the same number as were present before the troop surge began in early 2007 .
The president said there had been significant military , political and economic progress in Iraq since then , and that " today we have the initiative " .

Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Democratic leaders did welcome Mr Bush 's shortening of combat tours from 15 to 12 months , but said keeping troops committed to Iraq was unacceptable .
The speech " can only be described as one step forward and two steps back , " said the leader of the Democrats in the Senate , Harry Reid .
Autumn reduction US Defence Secretary , Robert Gates said he hoped Gen Petraeus would be able to make an assessment of further troop reductions later this year .
" A brief pause for consolidation and evaluation following a return to pre-surge troop levels will allow us to analyse the process and its effects in a comprehensive way , " he told the Senate panel in Washington .
" I do not anticipate this period of review to be an extended one , and I would emphasise that the hope , depending on conditions on the ground , is to reduce our presence further this fall . "
The BBC's Kim Ghattas , in Washington , says that dissenting voices are now being heard among Republicans as well , because of the high cost of the war , and the long - term agreements which are being negotiated between Iraq and the United States .
Iraq is one of the key battlegrounds of the election campaign , with Republican John McCain arguing for continued engagement while Democratic rivals Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama call for full withdrawal .

What are these ?
BAGHDAD  A bombing on Monday evening killed 43 people near the Imam Hussein shrine in the Shiite holy city of Karbala , penetrating one of the most secure perimeters in Iraq .
Iraqi police officers at the scene and several witnesses said it had been carried out by a female suicide bomber , but the police chief later said the bomb had been hidden .
The explosion , the deadliest attack in Karbala in nearly a year , overshadowed a Baghdad visit by Vice President Dick Cheney , who met with Iraqi and American leaders and extolled what he described as “ phenomenal ” security improvements in the country .
Arriving on the eve of the five - year anniversary of the war , the vice president strove to label the invasion and occupation a success .
“ If you reflect back on those five years , I think it ’s been a difficult , challenging , but nonetheless successful endeavor , ” he said in Baghdad , adding that “ it ’s been well worth the effort . ”
The explosion rocked central Karbala about 6 p.m .
“ Many people were killed and wounded , ” said Abu Ahmed , 36 , who minutes earlier had walked past the site and then came rushing back to help the wounded .
“ Everyone near the bomber was killed . ”
For your amusement , I 've posted the full text of a press release the Drug Czar 's office sent out last week in opposition to a marijuana decriminalization bill in New Hampshire .
I disagree with it , of course , but that is not why I 've posted it .
I share this because it is so filled with factual and grammatical errors that I 'm told NH legislators have been forwarding it around and laughing at it .

Press Release
Wednesday , March 19 , 2008 STATEMENT FROM DEPUTY " DRUG CZAR "
SCOTT M. BURNS ON MARIJUANA
DECRIMINALIZATION EFFORTS IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE ( Washington , D.C. ) – Today , Scott M. Burns , Deputy Director for the Office of National Drug Control Policy ( ONDCP ) , made the following statement regarding marijuana decriminalization legislation , which is currently being debated in New Hampshire .
" Decriminalizing the illegal and highly addictive drug – marijuana – sends the wrong message to New Hampshire 's youth , students , parents , public health officials , and the law - enforcement community .
" The supporters of decriminalizing marijuana are fooling themselves if they believe the manufacturing , possession , and / or distribution of 1.25 ounces or – over 90 marijuana joints – is good public policy .
" Decriminalizing marijuana – the drug which sends the most of America 's youth into substance abuse treatment and recovery – is a dangerous first step towards complete drug legalization .
In fact , marijuana sends the highest percentage of New Hampshire residents into drug treatment than any other illicit drug .
" The last thing New Hampshire need is more drugs , drug users , and drug dealers on their streets and communities – further straining limited law enforcement manpower and resources .
I strongly urge responsible leaders in New Hampshire to stop any effort to decriminalize or legalize the highly addictive drug marijuana . "

http://www.ondcp.gov/drugfact/marijuana
Not a word of this is true , of course , but the highlight is the 3rd paragraph in which Burns reveals utter confusion about what the bill even says .
The proposed law decriminalizes possession of up to 0.25 ounces of marijuana .
It does not decriminalize up to 1.25 ounces and it applies only to possession , not manufacture or sales .
Burns is either lying , or he is just dramatically and embarrassingly wrong .
Furthermore , 1.25 ounces is n't 90 joints anyway .
An average joint is a gram , so 1.25 ounces is 35 joints , give or take .
Since the bill in question decriminalizes only 0.25 ounces , however , we 're really talking about just 7 joints .
Nothing could be more typical of our friends at the Drug Czar 's office than to claim that 7 joints = 90 joints .
Finally , we learn that marijuana must remain illegal because so many people in New Hampshire are in treatment for it .
This is n't a lie necessarily , but it is pretty funny .
How many of those people were forced into treatment following a marijuana arrest that would n’t have happened under the proposed law ?
We are arresting people for marijuana , forcing them into treatment , then citing those stats as evidence that marijuana is addictive and that we should be allowed to arrest people for having it .
That is how stupid the modern marijuana debate has become .
Fact and fiction aside , the whole thing is just ugly to read .
Its grammar and sentence structure are reminiscent of the incoherent anti-drug rants one might find on this blog after a big link draws hostile attention .
Could they be written by the same person ?
" In fact , marijuana sends the highest percentage of New Hampshire residents into drug treatment than any other illicit drug . "
" The last thing New Hampshire need is more drugs , drug users , and drug dealers on their streets and communities – further straining limited law enforcement manpower and resources . "
It 's usually best not to get too caught up in correcting the grammar of one 's opposition , and in most cases I 'd consider that an indulgent and childish distraction from the real matters at hand .
In this case , though , I think the high - schoolish tone in which the Deputy Drug Czar addresses politicians and the press is just lazy and disrespectful .
Factual errors and bad writing are ubiquitous in any political debate , but when it arrives on White House letterhead , questions about basic competence merge with the broader ideological conflict .
You may have noticed a number of stories recently about undersea cables getting cut around the world .
Apparently the total is now up to 5 , but the scariest part of this is that Iran is now offline .
You can also read Schneier 's comments on this coincidence .by
As a commenter notes , though the country of Iran is obviously experiencing some networking difficulties , it is not offline .

Steven Fishman
Former member of the Church of Scientology .
« The statements related to financial crimes which were committed by me , Steven Fishman , after I was trained to participate in a securities class action fraud scheme by Scientology staff members at the Church of Scientology Mimi Org and the Church of Scientology Mission of Fort Lauderdale .
I spent the money obtained from the fraud on auditing , training , and for purchasing the third largest library of L. Ron Hubbard books , tapes , cassettes and E - Meters in the world .
After my arrest by the FBI in July of 1988 , Church officials , church officials ordered me to murder my psychologist , Dr. Geertz , because I had confided in my psychologist about the details of my crime .
I was thrown into " Treason " a low ethics condition , and was told by my Ethics Officer Frank Thompson that I could work my way up from " Treason " by protecting the Church from the FBI investigation .
I followed the orders of my Ethics Officer which resulted in my being charged with Obstruction of Justice .
At the same time , Church attorney Timothy Bowles worked closely with the United States District Attorney in Los Angeles in order to secure my conviction and eliminate any exposure to the Church .
In an effort to suppress the Church 's involvement in the fraud , Church officials ordered me to commit suicide , which was avoided due to a successful exit - counseling intervention by former members Margery Wakefield , Eddie Da Rocha , Richard Padilla , and through swift and effective therapy by Dr. Geertz . » — " Press Release : Scientology upper level references ( OT materials ) affirmed unsealed and in the public domain by United States Court of Appeals "
Wikipedia ( Jan. 2007 ) : " Fishman Affidavit "
Welcome to Steven Fishman's Home Page
Who is Steven Fishman ?
Was he really the biological father of Jesus Christ ?
The Church of Scientology said he was .
His auditors , Nancy Witkowski , Catherine Fox , Leah Abady , Ann Glushakow , Margaret Supak , Richard Reese , John Eastment , Hans Stahli , and Ray Mithoff all checked Steven Fishman on the e-meter over a period of years and told him over and over again that he was the biological father of Jesus Christ , and that it was Steve Fishman 's responsibility to de-Christianize the planet by exposing the lie and the myth of the immaculate conception , and thereafter bring all of Christianity into Scientology as the largest FSM ( Field Staff member ) or conversion movement of planet earth .
There is a drill in Scientology , known as " TR - L " , or the Training Routine for Lying , in which a Scientologist is trained to " outflow false data effectively . "
That was mandatory drilling for all Guardian Office agents and currently for all OSA Agents doing their basic training .
TR - L is part of the full hat pack for every DSA or Director of Special Affairs .
In the Policy Letter written by Hubbard entitled " On Control and Lying " , Hubbard wrote , " The only way you can control people is to lie to them . "
Karin Spaink presents " The Fishman Affidavit "
The case file for Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz contains over 700 documents .
This web page presents a declaration filed by Steven Fishman on April 9 , 1993 in which he included the OT ( Operating Thetan ) materials as exhibits .
Links to a few other interesting affidavits are given at the end of the page .
The order form for these materials will not be honored now , since the judge sealed the files on August 15 , 1995 .
Steven Fishman Deposition ( Part 1 )
Former Scientologist Steven Fishman and his psychologist Dr. Uwe Geertz were sued by Scientology after they were interviewed by Time magazine for a cover story about Scientology , " The Cult of Greed and Power . "
Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz :
It was in this trial that the formerly secret upper levels of Scientology were entered into evidence and thus released to the public .
Dr. Touretzky : " Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz "
A selection of publicly - available legal documents filed in U.S. District Court , Central District of California .
" The Fable "
Scientology 's obsession with secrecy has developed for a purpose .
It has been deliberately designed to hide its abuses , casualties and its real purposes and nature .
Less that 2 % of the individuals within Scientology have ever seen the inner secret initiations and information of this story .
Significant parts of this story have never been seen before in any form .
Scientology members who have been exposed to Hubbard 's secret writings are required to sign nondisclosure agreements for the rest of their lives .
To attempt to enforce secrecy Scientology has even registered Hubbard 's secrets as its " trade secrets " .
This story is the result of decades years of research from the work of many different researchers and sources .
Often in unexpected ways , the style and structure of this story will seem to suddenly twist and turn as it tries to unveil the convoluted secret Scientology and the layers of deception and misinformation used to hide it secrets from uninitiated outside eyes and ears .
In discovering the secret Scientology for yourself keep in mind that the overall context of Scientology and its actual actions IS as important as specific initiation details . [...]
Steven Fishman ( 1991 ) : " Lonesome Squirrel "
At one point in time and not too very long ago , I fancied myself a decent system administrator with a decent resume and work history .
When I finished a series of writing tasks working on technology subjects that included system administration , I thought the time had come for me to work in a shop with Linux and MS .
I put my resume up on Dice and Monster and waited for the phone to ring .
When it did n't ring , I went up to see the hits .
I saw six on Monster and eight on Dice .
Only one company saved my data .
I do n't know what possessed me to build a tech writer resume , but I did .
I had enough experience and I wrote the white papers no one " got around to " , user manuals , policy and procedure guides , S - 1 SEC registration sections and so forth .
On Monster I immediately started getting hits - something like 164 in a week .
On Dice the number was something like 186 .
I switched back to my sysadmin resume and again I got four to eight hits .
That 's counter intuitive to my experience .
As a friend at JBoss once said , " gotta eat " .
So , I started accepting short - term writing assignments .
I learned several things about the field .
Aside from the massive requirements of documentation for such things like Sarbanes Oxley , HIPPA , SAS70 and warehousing of data , many companies had a trick up the sleeves .
They advertised for a technical writer , but they really wanted business and system analysts they could land for $ 30 - 35 an hour .
I have yet to see a position come my way that wanted an internal writer who checked for grammar , spelling and business rules .
The prospective employer wanted someone with UML , EDM , Visio and MS Project experience .
They also wanted someone to back an undocumented software application into its original specs .
The job requirements : Re-engineer a running application that never had functional of technical specs .
I took two projects like that at some very large companies and discovered a massive chasm in documentation and if any existed at all - a lack of updates .
That led me to think about my experiences attempting to fix and document some popular Open Source projects .
If large corporations with plenty of resources have neglected their docs , then what can we expect from a community whose contributing members are almost entirely programmers .
Open Source documentation has a lot in common with the corporate world .
On my last assignment , I discovered a large population of wikis .
Every department had at least one .
At one point someone maintained those information storehouses , but almost all of them sat on the Intranet barren and abandoned .
I asked people if they knew anything about their department 's wiki and I found one person who even knew one existed .
She maintained it daily .
Is providing Linux documentation an insurmountable task ?
I 'm starting to think so .
The major technical book publishers have dropped their efforts to recruit authors and publish sysadmin books .
Instead , they have started focusing most of their attention on programming .
Who can blame them .
To eat , they had to publish books that sell enough to pay for the effort and provide some return on investment .
That 's not happening right now .
I 'm not discouraged or suggesting you or anyone else stop posting information for others to find .
I just see the job as bigger than me and almost any other writer .
The heyday for technical writing specialists has arrived and a shortage exists .
I 'm just glad I took Miss Johnston 's English class . , where I got lots of detentions so I could stay after school and hang out with the teacher .
LEGO Homer was a personal project ; as a professional artist , Sean can't sell copies of copyrighted characters .
Contact Sean if you 'd like to commission something else .
Design
Building it
Technique
Just a big cupholder
Public display
Sean spent over 2 weeks designing and building the sculpture .
It was the first time he had ever built a large - scale LEGO sculpture .
Much of the building process was pure visualization , double - checked by a little counting and math .
( Sean had to recall a lot of math that he had not used since high school , such as the " rise over run " principles from geometry . )
Sean finds that building curved surfaces with square bricks is a fun challenge , so he did not do any pre-planning , sketching , measurements , or computer - aided design prior to beginning this model .
Sean started the prototype by building Homer 's eyes , and then building his face outwards from there .
He created 75 % of his head before he realized that the model was not coming out to his liking .
So , putting this first attempt aside , he started construction on a second face , comparing the two as he went , working to get a better result .
Once his head was done , Sean began working downward , creating the collar , bust , belly , legs , and feet .
Building downwards can be problematic ...
Often , as the outer shell approached a part of the superstructure , Sean would have to pry pieces into the center of the model , which caused creaking and bending that had to be corrected later .
In some ways , Homer is similar to smaller models like Sean 's 1:20 scale VW beetle , because of the visualization needed for some of the complex curves .
In many other ways , however , it proved very different .
Most importantly , when working on a model of this size , a internal support is very important .
In Homer 's case , a sturdy column runs vertically along the full length of his body , from the base of his neck all the way down his center to between his feet .
This allows his head to rest on a sturdy platform , and branches off to several cross - braces at his hips and arms .
Since Homer 's open hand was to be used as a cup - holder for a real beer can , his hand has to support a lot of weight , even though it does n't have any direct support underneath .
After a little experimentation , a sturdy truss along the bottom inside of Homer 's arm that now leads from his wrist back to his elbow , and then bends into his body and connects with the main superstructure .
An additional smaller truss spans the base of the cup holder and connects with his wrist .
Built in 2003 , the model went on display in August 2005 in Arlington , Virginia , outside Washington DC .
The model was mentioned in The Washington Post and was on the home page of Wired Magazine for two weeks .
The African National Congress ( ANC ) was designated as a terrorist organisation by South Africa 's old apartheid regime .
Since that time , things changed .
Apartheid is not legal anymore , Nelson Mandela was released from prison , and the ANC became the government .
Other things have not changed : all ANC leaders , including Nelson Mandela , are still tagged as ' terrorists ' in US security databases and need to get a special waiver to enter the US .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has now asked for the " embarrassing " travel restrictions to be lifted .
Good .
I am happy the US administration is keeping up with the fast moving pace of world politics .
The ANC has been South Africa 's governing party since 14 years .
( Full )
Soon , one embarrassment less .
Some more challenges still to tackle , though .
Like convincing US President Bush statements like " Mandela is dead " is not really OK .
Not really .
It might have something to do with the fact that Mandela has never been short of criticism on US politics or the current US presidency .
Remember that back in 2003 , he commented : " If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world , it is the United States of America .
They do n't care . "
Mandela was rather specific on Bush too : " What I am condemning is that one power , with a president who has no foresight , who cannot think properly , is now wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust ( referring to the Iraq war ) . " ( Full )

Analysis
「 ソフトウェアの部品化」が失敗する理由
経済産業省のとある外郭団体の委員をしている方と話をしていたら「我が国のソフトウェア産業を改革するためには、ソフトウェアの部品化を推進しなければならない」と話していた。うーん……ソフトウェアの部品化かぁ……。正直、頭をよぎったのは1980年代後半に国内のソフトウェア部品の集積を目指して立ち上げられたが、失敗した「Σ（シグマ）プロジェクト」だ。
Σプロジェクトから20年の歳月を経て同じコンセプトが出現するには理由がある。日本の輸出を支えている製造業で、製品におけるソフトウェアの比重が高まるに伴って、業界全体がソフトウェア・エンジニアの不足および、ソフトウェア関連の障害の多発に悩まされているからである。
外注先企業が作ったソフトウェア障害に悩まされている製造業の視点から見れば「なぜ、ソフトウェアはこんなにトラブルが出るのか？
部品化して、それぞれの部品の品質チェックをもっと厳しくし、その上で再利用すればコストは下がり品質が上がるに違いない」と考えるわけだ。
分かりやすい部品 化
実際のところ、この 「ソフトウェアの部品化と再利用の推進」というキーワードは我が国のソフトウェア産業における政策課題としてしばしば取り上げられている。
おそらくその1つの理由は、「部品化」という比喩が門外漢にもきわめて分かりやすいからだろう。部品化は以下のように理解されている。
部品を再利用すれば生産性が上がる 不具合が出るのは部品の品質基準がないからだ
汎用部品を使わず専用部品を作るから費用がかかる
完成品メーカーになれなくとも、高品質な部品を提供する産業として成長できる
そして最後に、部品が流通する市場と仕組みを作ろう、部品の品質基準を作り安全な再利用を促そう、という結論が導き出されることが多い。しかし、20年にわたって推進され続けていると言っても過言ではないソフトウェアを部品化するというコンセプトであるのに、その成果は見えてこない。また、一般のエンジニアがソフトウェア部品を提供しているという話をあまり聞かない。これはなぜなのだろうか？
再利用は茨の 道
一般の製造業の部品に関してもいえることなのだが、実は「
リサイクルするより使い捨ての方が安い」ことが多い。リサイクル部品は利用履歴が不明で必要な強度の有無を検査する必要があるし、強度に不安がなければもともと過剰な品質なのだろう。同じことはソフトウェアにも言える。同じ機能を持つモジュールであっても、単一ユーザーのシンプルな利用状況向けに作るのと、様々なユーザー向けに多様で複雑な利用状況に対応して作るのでは、内部の複雑さも、必要とされる検証工程も格段に違ってくる。
実のところ、部品化とは
再利用は品質の安定期まではかえってコストが上がる
初期目的外のテストは過剰で、そもそも行われてない
汎用化を目的とせず使い捨てコードを書くことで、短期的コストは下がる
高い再利用性を持った部品群を作成する方が、使い捨てコードよりも高度な技術が必要
なのだ。
おそらく現在、世界で最も再利用されているソフトウェア部品は「
Windows」と思われるのが、マイクロソフトの年間研究開発費はおよそ7000億円である。多人数に利用されるコードの開発には莫大な費用がかかり、これだけの投資をして品質基準を定めたドライバの認証制度などを行っても、「安定性が」などと非難されるのだ。
技術でもツールでもない課題
「 部品化を推進」という言葉。この志は正しい。しかし、ベンダがパッケージソフトウェアは作れなくても部品ぐらいと考えるのであれば誤りだ。
部品化の実現には、技術的な課題以上に実は経営資源的な課題が横たわっている。日本のソフトウェア企業が部品化を推進できない理由。それは「納品物の作成に手一杯かつ、採算はギリギリで再利用に足る品質を持ったコード作成に必要な資金投下がそもそもできない」ことも理由である。そもそも日本のソフトウェア企業の研究開発予算比率はきわめて低い。
プラットフォーム、ミドルウェアを提供できるソフトウェア企業が極端に少ない我が国。過去、一貫して課題と認識されながら解決されない問題があるとき、そこには一貫した原因があるはずである。そろそろ我が国もソフトウェア産業の構造自体を再編しなければならない時に来ているのではないだろうか。

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Global stocks fell sharply and the dollar tumbled on Monday as a fire sale of Bear Stearns and an emergency Federal Reserve cut of a key lending rate sparked fears that a worldwide credit crisis will claim more casualties .
Traders reported that money markets were near standstill with banks increasingly wary of lending to each other .
European shares sank nearly 3.5 percent , following a sell - off in Asia where Japan ’s leading indexes shed 3.7 percent .
Wall Street looked set for a sharply downward open .
The dollar hit new lows against the euro and a basket six of major currencies .
Oil hit a new high of nearly $ 112 a barrel on the weaker dollar .
Investors dived into safe haven assets , lifting gold to more than $ 1,030 an ounce at one point and sending yields on short - dated euro zone debt below 3 percent for the first time in more than two years .
“ The markets are in a complete state of panic and in such situations there is no such thing as valuation or value in any asset , ” said Michael Klawitter , FX strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt .
In a shock move late on Sunday , the Fed lowered the discount rate it charges on direct loans to banks to 3.25 percent from 3.50 and implemented steps to provide cash to a wider range of financial firms , using tools last used in the Great Depression .
Minutes earlier , JPMorgan Chase &
Co had said it would buy Bear Stearns for a rock - bottom price of $ 2 a share , valuing the U.S. investment bank at the centre of a widening global credit crisis at about $ 236 million .
JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York temporarily bailed out Bear Stearns on Friday after a deterioration in its liquidity , one the worst cases yet in a broad - based drying up that has been going on since mid-2007 .

That would take U.S. rates down to just 2.0 percent .
“ Desperate times need desperate measures .
The Federal Reserve is doing what it takes to restore stability , ” said Craig James , chief equities economist at Commsec in Sydney .
There were also signs of continuing liquidity worries -- three - month interbank lending rates for euro and sterling leapt .
The Bank of England said it would offer 5 billion pounds ( $ 9.85 billion ) of three - day funds in an exceptional fine - tuning operation designed to bring overnight interest rates down .
“ This action is being taken in response to conditions in the short - term money markets this morning , ” the Bank said in a statement .
Market strategists said there was deep distrust between banks when it came to lending .
“ It ’s quite illiquid this morning .
If you want unsecured cash you ’re really going to have to pay up for it .
It ’s really quite an intense situation , ” said David Keeble , head of rate strategy at Calyon .
Concern swirled about the problems spreading to other banks .
Shares of Lehman Brothers dropped 34 percent in pre-market trading , shares of Merrill Lynch fell 15 percent and Goldman Sachs declined 9.8 percent .
STOCKS , DOLLAR DOWN SHARPLY
Equity markets took a hefty hit across the world as uncertainty grabbed hold of investors .

“ It is really -- and I do n’t want to use the broadly quoted word ‘ panic ’ here -- but it is an absolute confidence crisis and a liquidity crisis .
Nobody trusts anyone anymore .
It is not a nice situation , ” said Roland Hirschmueller , an equities trader at German brokerage Baader in Stuttgart .
European shares tumbled .
The FTSEurofirst 300 was down 3.5 percent .
Earlier , Japanese stocks fell to about a 2 - 1 / 2 year closing low , dragged down by exporters worried about a rising yen .
The Nikkei average fell 3.7 percent or 454.09 points to end at 11,787.51 , its lowest finish since August 8 , 2005 .
The broader TOPIX index shed 3.7 percent or 43.58 points to 1,149.65 , the lowest close since June 2005 .
The dollar plunged across the board .
It slid as much as 3 percent in early Monday trading as low as 95.77 yen according to Reuters data , the lowest since 1995 , and set fresh all - time lows at 0.9637 Swiss francs .
It later recovered to 96.88 yen and 0.9838 Swiss franc .
The euro soared as high as a new record $ 1.5904 before dropping back to $ 1.5774 .
The weak dollar drove oil prices higher before it eased back .
Crude for April delivery was up 5 cents at $ 110.28 a barrel , off a record $ 111.80 hit earlier .
Investors dived into safer assets .
Spot gold hit $ 1,030 an ounce , before falling back to around $ 1,022 an ounce .
“ Gold will be the main beneficiary ( of the falling dollar ) as a hedge against global risk , ” said Australia & New Zealand Bank senior commodities analyst Mark Pervan .
When the U.S. currency falls , the price of gold , like that of oil , tends to rise as investors with dollars buy it to lock in value and non -dollar investors find it cheaper .
Investors also bought bonds .
Short - dated euro zone government bond yields were at their lowest in over two years and implied rates down .
The two - year cash yield fell 11 basis points to 2.963 percent , its lowest since early 2006 .
Lispは学ぶ道具？ 使う道具 ？
エリック・レイモンド （Eric Raymond）のエッセイ 「ハッカーになろう*」では、Lispのことが以下のように紹介されています。
LISP は、それをモノにしたときの素晴らしい悟り体験のために勉強しましょう。この体験は、その後の人生でよりよいプログラマーとなる手助けとなるはずです。例え、実際にはLISPそのものをあまり使わなくても。
それに対し てLispハッカーであるポール・グレアム（Paul Graham）は以下のように反応*しています。
彼がLispについて言っていることはよくある意見だ。つまり、Lispを学べばよいプログラマーになれる、でもそれを実際に使うことはない、と。何故だい？
プログラミング言語なんてただの道具じゃないか。Lispでよいプログラムが書けるなら、使うべきなんだ。
そのとおり。あまり使われていませんが、Lispには優れたところがたくさんあります。わたしは、ポール・グレアムほどのLispハッカーではありませんが、Lispプログラマーの端くれ*として、今回はその素晴らしいLispについて簡単に紹介してみようと思います。
Lispの歴史
Lispの歴史は古く、その誕生は1958年だといわれています。1958年といえば、まだほとんどのプログラミング言語が登場していない時期です。このころすでに存在していたプログラミング言語で生き残っているのは、FORTRAN（1954年）とCOBOL（1959年）くらいのものでしょう。
Lispがプログラミング言語として特異なのは、もともとプログラミング言語として設計されたものではなく、数学的な計算モデルとして設計されたことに原因があると考えます。Lispの設計者として知られるジョン・マッカーシー（John McCarthy）は、それが計算機言語として使えるとは考えもしませんでした。単なる計算モデルとして記述した万能関数evalを、彼の研究室の大学院生であるスティーブ・ラッセル（Steve Russell） がIBM
704の機械語で実現したことによって、はじめてプログラミング言語Lispが誕生したのです。
Lispのすごさ
しばらく前になりますが、あるオブジェクト指向関連のイベントで「わたしがオブジェクト指向を理解したのは、Martin
Fowlerの『リファクタリング』を読んでからです」という講演を聞いて驚愕しました。オブジェクト指向に最初に触れたのが1980年代で、処理系といえばSmalltalkというわたしのような人間は「もう、じじいの領域だな」と強く感じた一瞬でした。
実際問題として 、Javaではじめてオブジェクト指向を学んだ人はかなりの割合になっているようです。そういう人たちにとっては、オブジェクト指向が真新しい概念のように感じられるかもしれません。また、Javaで強調されている例外処理やガーベッジコレクション、バーチャルマシンなどの概念も、最近登場したもののように感じられることでしょう。
しかし、それらはみん なJavaより何十年も（文字どおり何十年も）前にLispで実現されていたのです。オブジェクト指向の登場が1968年のSimulaであったことをご存じの方も多いと思います。実に40年近くも前のことです。1980年代にはLisp処理系上にオブジェクト指向システムを構築する研究が多数行われており、それらの研究を踏まえて、1988年にはCommon
Lispの標準としてCLOS （Common Lisp Object System）が取り込まれています。
このCLOSは、多重継承やマルチプルメソッドなど現在でもまだ斬新と考えられる機能がたくさん盛り込まれています。また、最近話題のアスペクト指向に類似の機能*であるメソッドコンビネーションも含まれています。Javaなどがようやく取り込もうとしている技術は、20年前のLispの技術だったわけです。
アスペクト指向だけではありません。Javaではじめてガーベッジコレクションを知った人も多いでしょうが、Lispはごく初期の処理系からガーベッジコレクションを備えていました。データをオブジェクトとして取り扱い、メモリの割り当てを明示的に行わないLispでは、ガーベッジコレクションは必須だったのです。これまた40年も前の技術ということになります。
バーチャルマシン、バイトコードインタープリタなどの単語もJavaとともに広く知られるようになりましたが、もともとはSmalltalkで用いられていた技術です。Smalltalkの実装は1970年代後半から1980年代初頭にかけて行われており、その技術もまたLispの影響を受けています。見る人が見れば、Smalltalkの処理系はLispの処理系にそっくりであることが分かります。
同じ時期に生まれ たFORTRANやCOBOLが、いままで蓄積した膨大な資産を管理するために細々と生き残っているのに対して、Lispはいつも時代の最先端に位置しているのは興味深いことです。

Lispプログラマーの端くれ もっともわたしが普段プログラムしているのはCやらRubyやらで、Lispを使うのはもっぱらEmacsのためだし、わたしの書いたプログラムはいつもLispらしくないのだが、今回はそれを棚に上げることにする。
アスペクト指向に類似の機能 それもそのはず、CLOSの設計者にはAspectJの開発者Gregor Kiczaleがいる。「アスペクト指向に類似」というよりアスペクト指向の基になったというべきか。

SANTA FE , New Mexico -- Data from faint earth tremors caused by wind - driven ocean waves -- often dismissed as " background noise " at seismographic stations around the world -- suggest extreme ocean storms have become more frequent over the past three decades , according to research presented at the annual meeting of the Seismological Society of America .
The International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and other prominent researchers have predicted that stronger and more frequent storms may occur as a result of global warming trends .
The tiny tremors , or microseisms , offer a new way to discover whether these predictions are already coming true , said Richard Aster , a geophysics professor at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology .
Unceasing as the ocean waves that trigger them , the microseisms show up as five - to 30 - second oscillations of Earth 's surface at seismographic stations around the world .
Even seismic monitoring stations " in the middle of a continent are sensitive to the waves crashing all around the continent , " Aster said .
As storm winds drive ocean waves higher , the microseism signals increase their amplitude as well , offering a unique way to track storm intensities across seasons , over time , and at different geographical locations .
For instance , Aster and colleagues Daniel McNamara from the U.S. Geological Survey and Peter Bromirski of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography recently published analysis in the Seismological Society of America journal Seismological Research Letters showing that microseism data collected around the Pacific Basin and throughout the world could be used to detect and quantify wave activity from multi-year events such as the El Niño and La Niña ocean disruptions .
The findings spurred them to look for a microseism signal that would reveal whether extreme storms were becoming more common in a warming world .
In fact , they saw " a remarkable thing , " among the worldwide microseism data collected from 1972 to 2008 , Aster recalled .
In 22 of the 22 stations included in the study , the number of extreme storm events had increased over time , they found .
While the work on evaluating changes in extreme storms is " still very much in its early stages " , Aster is " hoping that the study will offer a much more global look " at the effects of climate change on extreme storms and the wind - driven waves that they produce .
At the moment , most of the evidence linking the two comes from studies of hurricane intensity and shoreline erosion in specific regions such as the Pacific Northwest Gulf of Mexico , he noted .
The researchers are also working on recovering and digitizing older microseism records , potentially creating a data set that stretches back to the 1930s .
Aster praised the work of the long - term observatories that have collected the records , calling them a good example of the " Cinderella science " -- unloved and overlooked -- that often support significant discoveries .
" It 's absolutely great data on the state of the planet .
We took a prosaic time series , and found something very interesting in it , " he said .

Top positive review
5.0 out of 5 stars A class act .
The E platform uses capability - based security , which is a software architecture for achieving the Principle of Least Authority ( POLA ) in computer systems .
POLA is a simple and timeless principle : never grant anyone or anything more authority than they require .
This principle is referred to as  Need to Know in classified information venues , and is known as the valet key when applied to standard automobiles : the valet key giving the valet only the authority required to drive the car , not the unneeded additional authority to open the trunk .
This principle is known as exact change when purchasing milk at the local 7 - 11 .
The only people who have trouble understanding POLA are credit card companies ( which really do tell you to hand all your credit to the unknown operator of a remote Web site ) , and computer security experts who tell you to use larger numbers of longer passwords and ever more complicated firewalls .
All Windows and Unix operating systems ( referred to as  Winix  hereafter ) utterly disregard the concept of POLA .
When you launch any application be it a $ 5000 version of AutoCAD fresh from the box or the Elf Bowling game downloaded from an unknown site on the Web that application is immediately and automatically endowed with all the authority you yourself hold .
Such applications can plant Trojans as part of your startup profile , read all your email , transmit themselves to everyone in your address book using your name , and can connect via TCP / IP to their remote masters for further instruction .
This is , candidly , madness .
Side - by - Side comparison of a malicious Web Browser running under CapDesk capability confinement ( left ) , versus the same Browser running with standard Windows / Unix privileges ( right ) .
The confined Browser fails in all attempts to suborn the computer ; the Winix - enabled Browser takes full control .
With the E platform and the CapDesk capability secure desktop , software modules receive no authority by default .
Programs started in strict confinement ( a level of confinement far stricter than the confinement of the Java applet sandbox ) .
They receive authority only through the actions of the user .
A traditional initial objection to this strategy is that the user would have to spend much of his time granting authorities .
However , Combex has demonstrated with its existing operational prototypes that this does not need to be the case .
Actual applications in the field require surprisingly few authorities , and standard software technologies , such as the File Open dialog box and the drag / drop metaphor , make natural vehicles for their conveyance .
No passwords are required , no user authorization lists need management or maintenance .
A production version of the CapDesk desktop would look and feel like Windows or KDE , yet would create a secure environment almost for free .
So dramatically different is security as supplied with the E platform , it turns the traditional wisdom ,  You cannot have security without paying a price in flexibility  on its head , demonstrating that this dichotomy is only true when forced to use traditional security strategies .
CapDesk running on Win2 K with file manager windows open on the host OS and on a remote Linux system ; the communication with the remote Linux system is capability secure and strongly encrypted .
CapDesk blends functionality of the Microsoft File Explorer , FTP , SSH , and flexible fine grain security options in an integrated fashion not reproduced in any conventional application .
The first operational version of CapDesk was developed by a single programmer over the course of a month of weekends a remarkable comment on the productivity E provides for secure distributed systems .
The E platform enhances not only security of individual computers , but also the security , reliability , maintainability , and development speed of distributed systems .
Peer - to - peer , B2B , and corporate intranet systems benefit from Es deadlock - free promise - based distributed computing architecture , and from the way in which all communication is automatically and transparently strongly encrypted without programmer effort .
The tutorial application for first - time learners of E is the eChat peer - to - peer capability secure chat tool , which is only five pages of code .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that E can offer developers a productivity improvement somewhere between a factor of 3 and a factor of 7 over conventional programming languages such as Java , within the domain of secure distributed applications .

Images from an Apollo 15 landing movie show the dust blasted across the surface by the descending Lunar Module .
New research has revealed the seemingly gentle touchdowns of the six Apollo Lunar Modules ( LMs ) on the moon between 1969 and 1972 were actually incredibly violent events .
The Lunar Module 's descent engine blew out high - velocity lunar particles that strafed the landscape .
" The smallest particles were seen by the Apollo astronauts to fly right out over the horizon and keep on going , " said Philip Metzger of NASA 's Kennedy Space Center ( KSC ) .
" Depending on the actual velocity they may have gone halfway around the moon or more .
In most cases they would only travel until they hit a natural terrain feature , such as a crater rim or a mountain range . "
These minute specks of lunar dust are estimated to have been propelled at speeds of between 0.6 and 1.5 miles per second ( up to 5,400 mph or 8,690 kph ) .
That 's nearly fast enough to escape the moon 's gravity and enter orbit around the sun .
Better knowledge of the phenomenon will inform plans to put people and habitats on the moon .
Force in a vacuum
Pinning down the mechanics of these Apollo induced dust storms was achieved by Forrest Lumpkin at the Johnson Space Center together with Jacobs Engineering in Houston .
Lumpkin and his team achieved the difficult task of simulating how the Lunar Module exhaust gases behaved in a vacuum .
A study of original Apollo landing footage undertaken by John Lane and Chris Immer , working for the ASRC Aerospace Corporation at the Kennedy Space Center , was also an essential factor in understanding just how a descending Lunar Module ( LM ) interacts with the lunar surface .
" New methods were developed to measure the shadows of the LM during its descent in the old Apollo landing videos , " Metzger said .
" From measuring these shadows , they have determined the shape of the blowing dust clouds under the LM .
This is one of our main sources of experimental data on the ejection of soil by rocket exhausts . "
The Apollo footage also shows that the blast from the LM engine gases were also powerful enough to move rocks up to 6 inches [ 15 centimeters ] in size .
Surveying the damage
While the rocket exhaust may roll large rocks a short distance , it is the smaller particles that have the most widespread effect on the landing area .
This is clearly demonstrated by the damage inflicted on the Surveyor 3 unmanned craft , which rested only 600 feet ( 183 meters ) from the descending Apollo 12 LM in November 1969 .
Study of the Surveyor camera and mechanical scoop returned to Earth by the Apollo 12 astronauts revealed it had been sandblasted by lunar dust .
" There were what looked liked permanent shadows cast into the Surveyor , " Metzger said .
" Cosmic radiation in the lunar environment had darkened the surface of the Surveyor and then the spray of fine dust from the Apollo 12 LM removed that darkening wherever the spray could reach . "
This same scouring process could easily damage the sensitive surfaces of future lunar hardware and fine lunar dust could also be forced into the interiors of surface equipment causing vital parts to jam .
" When the support collar was removed from the Surveyor camera , a small sample of soil and dust particles were found inside , where they had been injected through a small inspection hole that happened to be facing in the direction of the LM , " Metzger said .
Such fine dust , around 10 microns in size , makes up the bulk of what was kicked up by the LM , but larger particles around 60 microns wide ( the size of a very fine sand grain also made their mark on Surveyor 3 in the form of hundreds of micro-craters .
" The paint on the Surveyor camera shroud was fractured in a mud-cracking pattern , " Metzger told SPACE.com .
" Each intersection of cracks was at the location where a tiny particle had impacted , drilling a tiny cylindrical hole down into the paint and causing the fractures to spread out from there like spider - legs in a car windshield . "
The particles that caused this damage are estimated to have been traveling at around 1,300 feet per second .
The figure which ties in well with the expected velocity of particles blasted across the lunar surface by the LM engine just before touchdown .
( Bullets exit a rifle at between 600 and 5,000 feet per second , or 180 and 1,500 meters per second . )
Protecting our interests
The sleet of particles shot at Surveyor 3 by just one nearby landing serves as a warning for humankind 's return to the moon , and if spacecraft are to land near a future lunar outpost some precautions are going to have to be made .
[ Similar efforts are underway to figure out the effects of Mars landers . ]
" We are currently investigating several different techniques .
One idea is to use the natural terrain to block the spray between the landing site and the lunar outpost , " Metzger explains .
" Another idea is to create an artificial terrain feature , a berm , around part of the landing site to block the spray in the crucial directions .
It may also be possible to modify the landing surface to prevent the spray altogether . "
Citing the above blockquoted comment of John Tanner Obama in his letter said :
Such comments are patently erroneous , offensive , and dangerous , and they are especially troubling coming from the federal official charged with protecting voting rights in this country .
Mr. Tanner has already demonstrated questionable judgment in overruling the decision of Justice Department lawyers that the Georgia photo ID requirement would disproportionately discriminate against African Americans .
For Mr. Tanner to now suggest , in an effort to defend his erroneous decision , that photo identification are not necessary for minority voters because " they die first " shows just how far the Justice Department has fallen .
This is a disgrace and yet another reason why the next Attorney General must demonstrate a strong commitment to civil rights .
But , until the next Attorney General is confirmed , you are in charge of the Department , and you are in charge of ensuring that our laws are enforced and that the civil rights of all Americans are protected .
Through his inexcusable comments , Mr. Tanner has clearly demonstrated that he possesses neither the character nor the judgment to be heading the Voting Rights Section .
For that reason , I respectfully request that you remove him from his position .
Note that this is second time this week that Obama has come out hard against a controversial figure from the Civil Rights Division .
Earlier , he blocked the nomination of Hans von Spakovsky to the Federal Election Commission .
UPDATE : Not only today 's demand that AG fires voting rights chief , Obama also asked Judge Mukasey the following questions regarding voting rights :
In recent years , the Department of Justice has demonstrated a clear preference for investigating isolated examples of voter fraud , rather than more widespread allegations of disenfranchisement of minority voters .
As Attorney General , will you commit to a program of enforcement that is aimed at enhancing , rather than diminishing , the ability of racial and ethnic minorities to vote ?
Will you commit to applying the Voting Rights
Act to challenge voter identification laws such as those attempted in Georgia and other states ?
The Department of Justice seems to have weakened its stance on the enforcement of apparent racial profiling cases under 42 U.S.C 14141 , which allows for civil lawsuits to be brought by the Department against racial profiling by our nation ’s police departments .
Will you commit to opening investigations and pursuing lawsuits against police departments that reveal a pattern or practice of police misconduct ?
In recent months , our nation ’s attention has been focused on the racial strife in Jena , Louisiana , and the disparate treatment of six African American youths .
As Attorney General , will you commit the investigative resources of the Civil Rights Division to ensuring the fair treatment and execution of the law in cases such as the Jena 6 , as well as the recent acquittal by an all - white jury of eight prison guards accused of killing a young black male at a juvenile detention center in Florida ?
Several studies have found that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered into high - cost subprime loans than other borrowers , even after controlling for factors such as income , loan size , and property location .
Although multiple concerns have been raised in recent years about discrimination in the housing market , the number of housing cases filed by the Housing and Civil Enforcement Section has fallen from 53 in 2001 to 31 in 2006 , and cases involving discrimination have fallen by 60 % .
In 2003 , the Justice Department announced that it would no longer file disparate impact cases involving housing discrimination – a sharp break from DOJ ’s longstanding and bipartisan policy to aggressively litigate these cases .
In light of recent reports of stark racial disparities in the subprime lending market and the sharp drop in housing discrimination enforcement actions , what steps will you take to ensure that the nation 's housing discrimination laws are vigorously enforced ?
Will you commit the Housing and Civil Enforcement Division to investigating whether the practices of the mortgage lending industry violate the Equal Credit Opportunity Act , Fair Housing Act , or other federal antidiscrimination statutes ?
In 2002 , the Bush Administration placed political appointees in charge of hiring new attorneys in the Civil Rights Division – departing from the longstanding practice of giving this hiring authority to career professionals .
Since then , less than half of new hires in the Division ’s important Appellate , Employment Litigation , and Voting Sections have had any prior civil rights experience – and less than a quarter have had any prior experience enforcing the nation ’s civil rights laws .
The others , according to a Boston Globe analysis , " gained their experience either by defending employers against discrimination lawsuits or by fighting against race - conscious policies . "
Will you pledge to restore professionalism and end the practice of politicized hires within the Civil Rights Division ?
What specific steps will you take to reverse these trends in hiring ?
What is your opinion of the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act , which I introduced in January 2007 and which recently passed the Senate Judiciary Committee ?
Do you agree that this legislation is necessary ?
UPDATE 2 : h/t Bradblog who first broke the story .
You know , I thought I had long since seen the limits of Rudy Giuliani 's obsessive self - aggrandizement , of his cavalier willingness to exploit a national tragedy and the deaths of thousands in order to prop up his sputtering political career .
Heck , I thought there were limits , even for Rudy .
I should n't have been so naive .
Here is the Ghoul 's latest campaign ad ... this time with actual 9/11 footage included .
I cannot believe the gall of this megalomaniac .
There is footage here of a tower falling , of the simultaneous deaths of hundreds of people ... all now used as a prop for the Giuliani campaign .
What class .
Giuliani has made his political Hail Mary pass , and it is a tragic , tragic snuff film .
And Giuliani would have you believe , of course , that " the world wavered , history hesitated " , but he never did .
While the great grinding behemoth of history , the unceasing progress of the entire universe , apparently stopped for a moment to ask for directions or something , he was the guy , the one guy , who could pick up the ball .
Never mind , of course , the thousands of other heroes of September 11 .
Never mind the firefighters , never mind the heroes of United Flight 93 ... it 's all about Rudy , constant as the North Star .
As Steve Singiser writes in his excellent diary :
I might be reading too much into this , but did you notice that when the ad talks about the " world wavering " , his ad - man specifically used imagery of people running away ?
The image tries to convey as message : the rest of these pansies ran , but I stood stalwart .
Perhaps a coincidental use of video editing .
If not , a sick , sick moment .
Indeed .
As for history ... I have no idea how it is even possible for history to hesitate .
Apparently Giuliani is such a superhero that he holds the ability to stop time itself in his arsenal .
I myself would posit this :
History does not hesitate .
Ever .
It is one of the only phenomena in the world we can always count on ; history will always keep chugging along , with or without our help .
This is because history is a greater thing than any of us , greater than mankind , greater than the Earth itself .
History has quietly and impartially overseen all the events of humanity 's brief period on Earth : wars , famines , genocides , Shakespeare , Beethoven , the advent of democracy , the fall of Constantinople , the invention of the wheel , the invention of the hydrogen bomb .
It has overseen every event before we showed up , and it will continue long after mankind is gone .
History operates without loyalties , without any kind of human attachment .
History does n't care who wins wars , who loses them , who makes headlines , who wins elections .
History , frankly , will not care very much if humankind destroys itself within the next 200 years , or if a meteor comes along and does it for us .
History will endure , even if we do not .
It will continue .
That is all it has ever done .
Yet Rudy Giuliani , in his infinite arrogance , would not just put himself on the same plane as history itself , but he would exalt himself above it - for when history paused , apparently , he did not !
What positively Bushesque hubris .
Giuliani has , it seems , appointed himself more than a man .
I call bullshit .
I have one hope for history .
I hope that history will marginalize the man who sought so boldly to trivialize it .
I pray that the man who exploited tragedy and attempted to transcend history for the sake of politics , will be someday dismissed as a footnote in the annals of history itself .
I hope that thirty years from now , the name of Rudolph William Louis Giuliani will be mentioned only by political pundits as a clever joke referencing the complete and utter disintegration of some poor fellow 's political campaign .
I hope that this maniac , with delusions of grandeur that put our current president to shame , will every day be reminded that history ultimately dismissed him as a detail .
Every day , for the rest of his natural days .

I have been investing in the stock market for nearly ten years and acquired quite a bit of experience and knowledge ( mainly through making mistakes ) .
I ’ve never codified on a piece of paper until today .
Before I begin , I want to give credit where credit is due .
This post was inspired by CommodityWorld.com ’s Common Sense Rules for Traders .
Moreover , these are personal rules — so pick and choose what you like and ignore the rest .
# 1 – Pay off your debt before you invest .
Clean up your finances before you invest .
If you owe any consumer debt ( e.g. , credit cards , personal loans , or car loans ) , you need to get rid of them first .
These debts are expensive and rarely offer any benefit .
When you pay them down , you are guaranteed to save money on the interest .
The only exception is productive debt like home loans and business loans .
# 2 – Set up an emergency fund .
Keep a small amount of cash that you can use for emergencies or other opportunities .
To get started , you should have at least $ 1,000 set aside in a high - yield savings account .
As you get more established financially , a good goal is to set aside 3 - 6 months worth of living expenses to deal with any unforeseen circumstances .
# 3 – Do your homework .
Do not invest in the stock market until you understand how the stock market works , different investments that you can choose from , and the risk that you ’re taking on .
If you are eager to jump in , stick to the basic investments like a broad market index ETF or a target retirement ETF .
# 4 – Know your limits .
Understand your risk tolerance and formulate your investment strategy based on your risk profile , goals , and time horizon .
The market goes up and down all the time , and some investments are extremely volatile .
Do n’t buy an investment that would cause you to panic sell — that is how you lose your money .
# 5 – Have an investment plan .
Once you complete # 1 through # 4 above , you are ready to start investing , you need to put together a plan .
Always remain true to your plan and follow the style that works best for you .
For example , my investment plan is very simple .
I contribute regularly to my investment accounts and the money gets invested according to my asset allocation percentages .
I only use a handful of low - cost index ETFs to build my portfolio .
Whenever the percentages deviate from the allocation goal , I rebalance the portfolio by selling investments that made recent gains and buying investments that are lagging behind .
# 6 – Do your research .
Never buy and sell if you do not understand what you are buying or selling .
If you want to invest in individual stocks , you need to learn how to perform fundamental analysis and read the Cash Flow Statement , Balance Sheet , and Income Statement .
And you better damn well know what the hell you ’re doing , if you want to trade options , do short sales , trade leveraged funds , or trade on margin .
Or you can keep it simple like I do and just stick with the basic index ETFs with simple asset allocation and rebalancing strategy .
# 7 – Stick with liquid investments at the beginning .
Limit your exposure to illiquid investments , such as precious metals , jewelry , collectibles , antiques , ownership of a private company , commercial real estate , etc .
While some of these investments can be very profitable , they are difficult to sell at the fair market value when you need to sell quickly .
Investments such as stocks and bonds give you greater flexibility and have excellent historical performance .
# 8 – Time is money .
The more time you have to invest , the more money you will make — this means you should start investing as soon as you can .
Do you realize what difference a decade makes ?
A person needs to contribute about 3 times as much money to catch up to a person that starts a decade before him !

# 9 – Be patient .
You should never get into the market because you are eager to jump in , or you have a “ Fear Of Missing Out ” ( FOMO ) .
Conversely , you should never get out of the market because you panic or lost your patience .
Like the great Warren Buffett said ,
“ Be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful . “
# 10 – Buy and Hold .
Do not be an active trader .
Historically , the market always goes up in the long term .
However , there are a lot of ups and downs in the short term .
As an active trader , you are guaranteed two things :
You will pay more trading fees .
Even with $ 0 commission trades , you ’re still paying a small amount of bid / ask spreads , SEC fees , and TAF fees with each trade .
You will pay more taxes ( e.g. , short - term vs. long - term capital gains ) .
# 11 – Mind your taxes .
Investments that pay high dividends or make big distributions should be invested in your tax - deferred or Roth accounts .
Examples of these investments include bonds , dividend stocks / funds , and REITs .
In taxable accounts , make sure you regularly look for tax - loss harvesting opportunities to offset your gains .
And when you ’re taking profit , be sure to wait at least one year and one day so you can pay the lower long - term capital gains tax rate .
# 12 – Keep your costs low .
When it comes to investing expenses , even a 1 % expense can really dig into your gains .
The good news is you can easily manage your investment expenses .
Here are some ideas :
Use $ 0 commission broker instead of a broker that charges fees for trading , or a full - service broker .
Use ETFs instead of mutual funds .
Avoid funds and ETFs with a high expense ratio .
When you leave your job , rollover your 401 ( k ) into a self - directed IRA .
In general , a 401 ( k ) plan has more fees and the available investments have a higher expense ratio .
# 13 – Use Limit Orders .
You cannot control the price at which your order will be filled with a market order .
A market order is okay most of the time , but for some investments , a limit order gives you greater protection from price fluctuation .
Remember that your limit order may never get executed .
If you want to use a market order , do so while the market is open .
# 14 – Use Stop - Loss Orders .
Create a plan to limit your losses .
For example , set up stop - loss orders at reasonable price limits ; a good range is 10 - 20 % below the current value depending on the volatility of the investment .
When the price drops by a certain amount , the broker will automatically execute the stop - loss order for you , thus limiting your exposure to further price drop .
# 15 – Lock in your profit .
Similar to the idea of limiting your loss with a stop - loss order , you can also lock in your profit using the same technique .
As your investment price rises , you can increase your stop - loss limit to lock in the profit .
Diversify .
Divide your money into different investment vehicles ( e.g. , money market , stocks , bonds , mutual funds , ETFs , etc. ) , as well as various asset class ( e.g. , large US companies , small US companies , global , etc. ) and sectors ( e.g. , financial , utilities , technology , etc. ) based on your time horizon and risk profile .
Never risk more than 10 % of your capital on any one investment , especially an individual stock .
Reallocate once a year .
Different investments will grow at a different rate and throw your asset allocation out of whack .
It is a good idea to rebalance your portfolio at least once a year , or more , depending on the degree of misalignment and expenses involved .
Alternatively , use poor man ’s reallocation by adding new money to this year ’s poor performers .
Manage your risks .
In addition to diversification , do not risk the money you will need in the near future in high volatility investments .
Be wary of a bargain .
Never buy just because the price of the investment is “ low ” or sell just because the price is “ high . ”
Study the factors that are driving the price and why .
Buy and sell based on your research .
Stay your course .
Never change your investment strategy without a good reason .
If you did your research and executed accordingly , everything should be fine despite short - term setbacks .
If your investment drops significantly , the stop - loss order will take care of you .
Never let greed or fear take control over you .
Do n’t try to time the market .
Do not guess where the top and bottom of the market is .
Do not be afraid when the market , or your investments , reach all - time highs or lows .
Market timing myths like the January effect and October effect are not real .
Use your strategy and research as a guide .
Do n’t believe the hype .
Do not listen to the news and believe everything that is said , instead use your strategy and research as a guide .
Never sell into a panic .
Self - discipline is your friend when the market goes against your position .
Do your investments become unsound just because the market tanked ?
A lousy market does not make your investments bad .
Do n’t pile your bet on the winners .
Avoid the natural tendency toward increasing your position in successful investments .
Let your winners ride and look for more winners .
Do n’t throw good money after bad .
If your investment is diving , do your research and understand why .
Do not just keep piling in money to cost average down ; something may have changed since you last did your research .
Regular contribution is your friend .
If you have a big chunk of money , do n’t use dollar - cost averaging .
It ’s usually better to invest it all instead .
However , do regularly contribute to add new money to your investments .
Avoid taking small profits and big losses .
Do not sell your rising star just because it doubled in a few days .
Do your research .
If it is still a good investment , keep it .
Reinvest for success .
If your investment pays a dividend or distributes capital gains , reinvest that money .
You can participate in an automatic reinvestment program to avoid any minimum investment rule or trading fee .
Find your magic formula .
If you have expertise in a particular area , leverage it to boost your chance of success .
If you figured out something that works , stick to it .
That is until you can find a better magic formula .
Not all investments are created equal .
Do not treat all investments in the same way .
Learn their specific characteristics and choose the right tools for the job .
Look through other people ’s eyes .
Try to understand why a buyer would buy and why a seller would sell .
This will enable you to be more flexible and maximize your potential gain .
Learn from your mistakes .
Do not fret , but never let a mistake pass without learning from it — ask yourself what happened and why .
If possible , keep a log of your investment activities — e.g. , why you made them , what happened and why , etc .
Avoid trading on margin .
Always invest within your capabilities .
Trading on margin is a risky business .
At the least , you are guaranteed to lose the interest on the money you borrowed .
Be flexible .
As your knowledge grows and time changes , be ready to reevaluate everything and alter your plan .
Have fun .
Finally , have fun investing !
Here is $ 1,000,000 in play money to try out your investing strategy — it ’s free , and you can earn money .
There 's an argument against democracy that claims it can lead to mob rule .
One common quote is that " it 's two wolves and one sheep deciding what to have for dinner " .
See also tyranny of the majority .
There 's a wide range of how much of the population gets to make the big decisions .
If only 1 % of the population gets to make the decisions , then 99 % may suffer .
If 51 % of the population gets to make the decisions , then 49 % may suffer .
While 49 % may suffer , this is not a valid argument to support allowing 1 % to make the decisions , which would be even worse .
If you require that 100 % agree before a decision is made , then nobody will suffer , but decision making becomes harder and harder .
There is an anarchist concept known as decentralized democracy .
That means the more someone is affected by a decision , the more say he has in that decision .
If a decision barely affects 99 % of the people , then none of them get to vote .
The decision to kill someone affects the victim more than anyone else , so the victim should have more say in the decision than everyone else .
The decision over what you eat for lunch barely affects anybody else , so obviously you do n't have the entire society voting on what you have for lunch .
In cases like these , it becomes a democracy of one - thus anarchy .
Supporters of decentralized democracy would use their own power to protect the right of others to make the decisions that most affect them .
For example , this includes protecting other peoples ' lives , whether it 's from government or non-government forces .
When it comes to baking , sugar plays a significant role .
Any baker knows that but it is n’t a complex idea .
However , sugar itself is complex for it consists of fructose and sucrose .
There are those who believe that one is of higher quality than the other but a lot of people do agree that they all have the same quality .
Everyone is well aware that sugar is a sweetener .
But what people do n’t know is that , it can be used as a preservative , add volume , color and tenderness .
The Magic of Sugar
To give you an example , when sugar is creamed with butter , this creates air bubbles in the butter .
What happen is , the leavening agent is expanding air bubbles .
The reaction then causes the “ rise ” when baking .
This further improves the volume of baked goods .
Sugar also has hygroscopic properties .
In other words , it draws moisture from batter ingredients .
In addition to that , the amount of gluten is reduced to which it delivers a softer and tender result .
Apart from that , less gluten additionally means that there ’s greater volume as the baked good rises more .
Because of the reason that sugar is absorbing and drawing moisture in , it is prolonging the life of baked goods .
The actor was formally sentenced yesterday in Los Angeles , California , and his lawyer said he would begin serving the prison term immediately .
Sutherland , 40 , was also ordered to spend five years on probation and to complete an 18 - month alcohol education programme and six months of weekly therapy sessions .
He was fined $ 510 ( £ 250 ) .
" There will be no early release and no good time work time .
He will serve the entire sentence , " said Nick Velasquez , a spokesman for the LA city attorney .
In October , Sutherland pleaded no contest - the equivalent of a guilty plea - to a charge of driving with a blood alcohol level above the legal limit .
Thirty days of his sentence were for failing a blood - alcohol test after his arrest in September in west Los Angeles .
The remaining 18 days of the sentence were for violating his probation from a previous case .
In 2004 , the actor was sentenced to five years probation and 50 hours of community service and was ordered to complete an alcohol program in connection with another drink - driving arrest .
Sutherland had been pencilled in to complete his jail sentence in two parts , in order to allow filming on 24 to continue , but the US screenwriters ' strike means production has been suspended .
The Canadian actor , the son of the screen star Donald Sutherland , won an Emmy award last year for his role as the counter - terrorism agent Jack Bauer on 24 .
New treatments can now be tested in mice
It had been thought rhinoviruses , which cause most human colds and can trigger asthma attacks , could only affect higher primates .
The researchers hope their genetically modified mice will provide a valuable test - bed for potential new medications .
The study , led by London 's Imperial College , appears in Nature Medicine .
It will open up new paths to finding treatments which have been delayed for many years
Sir Leszek Borysiewicz
Medical Research Council
Rhinoviruses are the major cause of acute attacks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder ( COPD ) - another name for chronic bronchitis and emphysema - which can be fatal .
Although they were discovered 50 years ago , the failure to find a way to infect small animals has proved to be a major stumbling block to developing new treatments .
As a result , there are curently no effective treatments .
Lead researcher Professor Sebastian Johnston said : " These mouse models should provide a major boost to research efforts to develop new treatments for the common cold , as well as for more potentially fatal illnesses such as acute attacks of asthma and of COPD . "
Of the 100 known strains of the rhinovirus , 90 % attack by latching on to a particular receptor molecule found on the surface of human cells .
The viruses cannot bind to the mouse version of the same receptor .
The latest research has succeeded in modifying the mouse receptor so it is more like the human version .
This meant the modified mice could be infected with the virus .
The researchers were also able to trigger asthma - like symptoms in the infected animals by exposing them to a protein found in egg white , which is known to provoke an allergic reaction in the lungs .
Important discovery
Sir Leszek Borysiewicz , chief executive of the Medical Research Council which funded the study , said : " This important and fundamental discovery will enable us to understand the effects rhinoviruses and common colds have on our health .
" It will open up new paths to finding treatments which have been delayed for many years and provides us with the opportunities for further breakthroughs in the future . "
Leanne Male , of the charity Asthma UK , said : " Ninety per cent of people with asthma tell us that colds and flu trigger their asthma symptoms but as yet there is no specific treatment for virally induced asthma attacks and steroid treatments are only partially effective against them .
" We welcome this latest advancement as it will lead to a greater understanding of viral infections and their link with asthma and may help the development of a suitable treatment for virus - induced asthma attacks , thus greatly improving the lives of the 5.2 million people with the condition in the UK . "
AC / DC are the kind of band that ’s so great you can never get enough of them .
Actually they ’re not a kind of band , they ’re their own kind of band !
So good news for all of you who love their fantastic music : they ’ve finished recording and are currently mixing the effort for a late 2008 release .
Brian Johnson released this piece of information Tuesday , April 22 .
Johnson has apparently left the studio in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada where AC / DC guitarists Angus and Malcolm Young have remained with producers Mike Fraser and Brendan O’Brien in order to complete work on the CD .
He also stated that they ’re taking care of the artwork .
According to Reuters , the new album will be AC / DC ’s first for Sony BMG ’s Epic Records label , which reissued the band ’s back catalog a few years ago .
That sounds pretty good … hopefully it will be finished this year and they ’ll go for a tour too .
I ’m saying that because New York radio show that AC / DC was rumored to be planning a “ farewell ” tour for later in the year .
I do n’t even know if that ’s bad or good …

Does being a Web user in 2008 automatically mean giving up your right to privacy ?
A growing chorus of voices says the evolution of the Internet , the increasingly cozy relationship between search and advertising companies and the rise of Web 2.0 social networking technologies adds up to an environment where true privacy may be but an illusion .
That idea is not a necessarily a new one , of course .
Sun Chairman Scott McNealy is famously quoted as saying " you have no privacy -- get over it , " back in 1999 , noted John Nicholson , a member of the global sourcing and privacy and data protection teams at New York law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman .
Going Too Far ?
" Between search engines , ad firms , Web sites that are not particularly ethical -- or downright nefarious -- and the government 's increasing desire to monitor online activities , McNealy 's statement is increasingly accurate , " Nicholson told the E - Commerce Times .
" Large social networking sites are looking for ways to extract more money from advertisers , and that means giving the advertisers more information about user activities . "
Web marketers and other companies have long been wary of going too far with consumer privacy , and in fact have long argued that consumers are willing -- if not eager -- to give up a certain amount of their personal privacy in exchange for access to Web sites , social networking connections and even advertising that is more targeted and therefore more suited to their needs .
Of course , at some point , consumers will say enough is enough , and one of those pain points may have been reached late in 2007 when Facebook 's Beacon program .
The program , which shared information about a user 's online shopping and review - posting activities with networks of friends , had to be curtailed amid strong criticism from privacy advocates .
Still , even if Beacon has to be rethought , the sheer amount of data being captured and stored about each individual Web user continues to grow and is used to refine Web sites and marketing offers .
As the calendar turns on 2008 , the question is whether it's too late for consumers to reclaim their privacy and if they 'd even try if they could .
Social Distortion
Many consumers have learned the hard way that information they share online -- or data they share in the real world but is stored online -- is n't always as secure , even in the hands of trusted merchants .
Massive breaches such as the one at TJX continue to expose credit card and Social Security numbers and other data , helping to raise the volume on calls for tougher national legislation aimed at protecting privacy .
" Given that 2008 is an election year , it 's unlikely that anything will happen on the legislative front at the federal level , " Nicholson said .
" On the state level , states are updating their data breach notification laws to cover things like PCI ( payment card industry ) compliance and medical information . "
Still , even if data is n't exposed in a breach , the fact that more companies are collecting and analyzing data -- and can increasingly connect the dots between a user 's shopping , searching and e-mail activity -- is itself a natural outgrowth of the advance of technology .
The Age of Transparency
" There 's no question privacy is compromised by the advancement in technology , " Herb London , president of the Hudson Institute in Washington , told the E - Commerce Times .
" The age of technology is the age of transparency , open systems and the ability on the part of any hacker to get into virtually any system . "
Of course , users have different expectations of privacy and those who join and take full advantage of social networking sites should probably bring lower hopes for having their privacy maintained to the table .
" In my opinion , when we 're talking about social networking sites , there is no reasonable expectation of privacy , " noted Marc Friedman , a partner with the Newark , N.J. - based law firm Sills Cummis & Gross .
" I believe people who use the Internet , in large part , do n't think about such issues as whether the information and data which they make publicly available through the Internet are going to be used for other purposes . "
" Online privacy is an illusion , " agreed David Axtell , an attorney with Minneapolis - based Leonard , Street and Deinard , and an expert on social networking issues .
Forever There
Users often forget that information posted online is not erased even if that page is taken down , especially with Google and others constantly indexing and archiving .
While some search engines , such as Ask.com , have made tools available to users to enable them to erase or scrub their searches , those same search engines often partner with Google and other engines that do n't offer such options .
" Businesses are out to seek a profit , and information is money , " Axtell told the E - Commerce Times .
" Many of the applications available to Facebook users , for example , are collecting responses and compiling lengthy personal data on you , which they may sell as they are not owned by Facebook , " said Axtell .
" Privacy policies are legally binding , but who reads them ? "
The stakes are only to get ratcheted up as more of what 's online is made searchable , he added , with Microsoft developing a photo - search tool that could turn a seemingly anonymous photo into an identifiable one by using face - recognition technology .
Consumers ' Call
Which way those developments move will likely depend on consumers themselves .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation advises users to take basic steps to minimize how much private -- and potentially embarrassing -- information search engines keep about them , from avoiding putting personally identifying information in searches to avoiding logging into a search engine or related page .
The group also advises consumers to consider using software such as Anonymizer or a tool such as Tor , which redirects Web traffic to disguise its origin .
The Beacon push - back may be a signal that privacy has moved to the front of mind for consumers , or it may simply be that the way Facebook and its partners rolled that program out left something to be desired .
Either way , given the billions of dollars worth of valuation now on the books for sites like Facebook , MySpace and Linked In , those sites are n't likely to stop trying to find innovative ways to drive revenue from their social networks .
Legislation may yet play a role in helping to balance the privacy scales , but " reputable online companies " will likely stay ahead of any such action by revising and updating their privacy policies to keep them current , Friedman said .
For instance , MySpace recently reached an agreement with 49 attorneys general to enact policies meant to make that site safer for young people by filtering out people who are potential online predators .
" I am expecting a number of developments over the next year that will affect this sector , " Friedman added .
Equity markets wobbled today on fears over a weak dollar , credit market turmoil and impending recession , but jitters subsided somewhat in late trading and the Dow recovered slightly by 6 pm GMT .
Markets in Asia , Europe and the US have all been sold off over the last 24 hours .
The dollar is also coming under significant pressure , not helped by more bad news from the US economy today , this time on high street spending .
Meanwhile oil and gold have shot up to record highs on the back of the weakening US currency .
The dollar fell below 100 yen for the first time in 12 years today and hit a new record low against the euro amid fears in currency markets that the US financial system is vulnerable to the recession spreading from the crisis - hit housing sector .
With troubled hedge fund Carlyle Capital Corp ( CCC ) lurching towards collapse , stock markets fell sharply as investors feared that the financial turbulance was approaching a new level .
There was some respite from credit ratings agency Standard & Poor 's comments that an end to sub - prime write - downs for large financial institutions is in sight .
The remarks appeared to lift US stock markets off their earlier lows but they remained sharply lower .
The slight recovery in the dollar and easing oil prices also helped stock markets tentatively recover their nerves .
The Dow had sold off sharply after the opening bell , but at 6 pm GMT was up around 12 points to 12,123 .
The FTSE 100 ended the day down 84 points , or 1.5 % , at 5692.4 , also off earlier lows .
Less than 48 hours after America 's central bank , the Federal Reserve , sought to shore up banks with a $ 200 bn ( £ 100 bn ) package of emergency fundings , Derek Halpenny , currency economist at BTM - UFJ , warned that " we are entering dollar crisis mode " .
" Looking at the markets there is a complete loss of confidence and that 's because the markets are concerned over the US financial sector and ultimately what the Fed will be forced to do to support that sector , " Halpenny said .
Dealers were selling the greenback aggressively today in expectation that the Federal Reserve will ignore the threat of rising inflation and cut interest rates by a further 0.75 percentage points next week .
Borrowing costs have already been cut by 1.25 points this year and currently stand at 3 % .
News that US retail sales fell last month defied analyst expectations for a rise and deepened the gloom around the world 's largest economy .
US government data showed consumers cutting back and sales slumping 0.6 % in February , cementing expectations of the big rate cut from the Fed .
Rob Carnell , economist at ING Financial Markets said the latest data compounded the bad news from weak US employment figures .
" Following two consecutive months of negative payrolls growth , about the only box remaining to be ticked before the US recession could be confirmed ' official ' was some weaker spending data .
Well consider that box well and truly ticked now , " he said .
" A 50 basis point cut on March 18 looks an absolute minimum . "
The prospect of lower US borrowing costs has been hammering the dollar and it fell across the board on foreign exchange markets , losing more than 1.5 % against the Japanese currency to trade as low as ¥ 99.77 at one point .
By late - afternoon UK time it had climbed back to ¥ 100.59 .
It was trading at just above $ 1.56 against the euro and was close to a record low against the Swiss franc .
The pound also gained ground against the dollar , moving up to $ 2.033 .
With the dollar weakening , other financial markets were also jittery and demand soared for safe - haven assets such as gold .
Futures in the precious metal pushed through $ 1,000 an ounce for the first time ever , while crude oil was changing hands at more than $ 110 a barrel - adding to inflationary pressures in the global economy .
London Brent crude was up more than $ 1 to a fresh record above $ 107 .
With the problems of the US in focus , the country 's treasury secretary Henry Paulson today came out urging US financial institutions to raise capital quickly so they can keep lending .
He also pledged tougher rules for the mortgage industry .
Analysts said the problems emerging in US hedge funds and private equity firms as a result of the losses made on investments based on sub - prime mortgages were the reason the impact of the Fed action this week on the dollar had proved short - lived .
This has been underlined by the rapid implosion of CCC .
It had borrowed around $ 20 bn from the world 's banks to invest in mortgage securities , and its financial position began to unwind last week as some lenders demanded their money back .
Today it admitted that it had failed to agree a new rescue package with its lenders , and has defaulted on $ 16.6 bn of its debts .
" Overall , it has become apparent to the company that the basis on which lenders are willing to provide financing against the company 's collateral has changed so substantially that a successful refinancing is not possible , " the fund said in a statement .
It also said that it is unable to meet its latest round of margin calls - demands for cash to cover a drop in the value of its assets - which is likely to force it into liquidation .
The collapse of CCC is likely to have a knock - on effect on other funds , by driving down the value of mortgage - backed assets and making banks more nervous about their exposure to the sector .
THE rising cost of food is being felt around the world , by the poor especially and , in turn , by politicians .
Greater demand from China and India as more people switch to rich diets is lifting prices , which had been low for some 30 years .
Last week the prime minister of Haiti resigned in the face of a mob angry at the cost of food , while the Philippines made hoarding rice a crime punishable by life imprisonment .
The price of wheat rose 77 % in 2007 .
Since January the price of rice has jumped by 141 % .
But growing more food takes time , and as the land available for production has decreased , governments and farmers must look to improve crop yields .

Every American should read this story .
Our money is pouring out of the U.S. and into Saudi Arabia .
But it 's not Saudi Arabia 's fault .
You can't blame them for ...
HUCK FINN COMMENTS :
Here 's what we all know deep in our hearts and brains but refuse to do anything about it .
Every time an American consumer goes to the pump , we 're building the economy in the Middle East .
New York Times ( Jan. 20 , 2008 ) ran an excellent story about the construction boom and high real estate prices in Saudi Arabia .
modernizing and building their country .
It 's not their fault they have oil and we do n't , or that oil skyrocketed to $ 100 a barrel .
It 's partially ours because of attacking Iraq as well as the increased demand of oil from USA , China and India .
I stared at the beautiful renderings of the lavish , planned cities in Saudi Arabia .
I thought , " Not a bad place to live . "
Saudi Arabia has oil , sunny days , lots of beach front property and a sh*# load of money .
Their economy , real estate and everything else is booming while we 're putting up foreclose signs all across America .
The Saudi 's plan for growth is sound .
They 're investing the money they 're making from high oil prices into mega projects , and expanding into new businesses so they 're not completely relying on oil revenues .
They 're taking the same playbook from Dubai and making it much , much BIGGER .
Saudi Arabia 's goal is to become a super industrial powerhouse by 2020 .
It 's refreshing to see a leader of a country with a clear vision of the future for their country .
Something Democrats and Republicans have failed to do over the last thirty years .
( Picture from The New York Times article , " The Construction site called Saudi Arabia , " January 20 , 2008 , by Jay Mouawad )
The drawings of these beautiful cities look like a cross between Blade runner and traditional Arabic design .
( It 's good to know they support Hollywood by watching American films . )
( Picture from The New York Times article , " The Construction site called Saudi Arabia , " January 20 , 2008 , by Jay Mouawad )
When Saudi Arabia took their oil sword out and struck America in 1974 , causing major lines at our gas pump , Jimmy Carter promised to make America energy - independent .
Every president after him promised the same thing .
Guess what ?
Nothing happened !
The moment high oil prices went down , we conveniently forgot about our energy independence .
NOT one president has gotten us any closer to independence .
Every time you pump gas , think about your money going straight to Saudi Arabia .
It 's a great picker upper lifter .
To add insult to injury , let me give you some very cool facts about Saudi Arabia :
Cool Fact # 1 : The Saudi G.D.P. ( Gross Domestic Product ) has doubled in the last five years - thanks to the high price of oil .
Cool Fact # 2 : If you exclude oil , economic growth has been 4 to 6 % a year since 2002 - thanks to the high price of oil .
Cool Fact # 3 : Oil has n't been the only engine of growth .
Saudi Arabia 's private sector now accounts for 45 percent of the economy - up from 20 percent about 20 years ago - thanks to the high price of oil .
Cool Fact # 4 : In 1999 , the Saudi government ’s debt was 120 % of G.D.P .
It 's dropped to below 20 % - thanks to the high price of oil .
Cool Fact # 5 : In 2007 , Saudi Arabia had a budget surplus of $ 48 billion , five times the surplus of 2003 - thanks to the high price of oil .
They expect an even bigger surplus at the end of 2008 - thanks to the high price of oil .
Cool Fact # 6 : The Saudi Arabian government expects these new industrial cities to add $ 150 billion to the country ’s G.D.P. by 2020 , create one million new jobs , and house five million people - thanks to the high price of oil .
Cool Fact # 7 : Bloomberg News estimates that overseas investments by Persian Gulf countries ( a good percentage of the investments is from Saudi Arabia ) reached a record $ 75 billion in 2007 - thanks to the high price of oil .
If you need more cool facts , please go to the New York Times article .
Americans consume 25 % of the global energy .
Therefore , my logic follows accordingly :
Americans driving " Bubba Cars " like SUV's , Trucks and Hummers
+ increased energy demand from China and India
+ Non-existent energy policies by Congress to reduce our consumption and dependence on oil
+ green ignorance = Saudi Arabia growth - thanks to the high prices of oil .
I tip my hat to Saudi Arabia for having the drive , vision and focus to transform their country from an oil - based economy to an industrial economy .
The good news for them is that low oil prices are over .
The price of oil wo n't come down to $ 20 until we find an alternative source of energy .
If ever .
Interesting that the Saudi 's goal is to have those new cities finished to 2020 .
Why can't we do the same ?
Why ca n't we set the date to transform our economy to a green economy by 2020 ?
We are building the Saudi Arabia economy with our own hard - earned money .
Think about that when you next fill up your gas tank .
OUR POLITICIANS MAKE ENERGY PLANNING INTO ROCKET SCIENCE
It 's not .
We need to consume less while we use the multiple sources of energy available to us .
We need to improve our energy efficiency while we look for alternative sources of energy .
Brazil did it in twenty years .
Why ca n't the U.S. ?
I 've come up with a business idea !
I 'll start a company that outsources American workers unemployed due to global outsourcing , and outsource them to Saudi Arabia to build all those " mega city " projects .
Gotta go ... time to write the business plan , raise capital , make money , retire and fulfill the American Dream .

Government Power Grabs : ' Predicting ' 2008
Monday , December 17 , 2007
By Radley Balko
ADVERTISEMENT
As the end of the year approaches , it 's time for another column of government overreach predictions for the New Year .
What outrageous , beyond - parody grabs at power and erosions of civil liberties will transpire in 2008 ?
My predictions :
— The Bush administration will claim it has the power to kidnap citizens of foreign countries for violating U.S. law , and extradite them to the U.S. for trial and imprisonment — even for white collar crimes unrelated to terrorism , and even for acts that are n't illegal in the countries where the target is a citizen .
— Police will take enforcement of prostitution laws to a new level , by arresting and seizing the cars of anyone who merely talks to an undercover cop posing as a sex worker .
Good samaratans , beware .
— The war on prescription painkillers will also reach new absurdities , as people will begin to be arrested and convicted of possessing painkillers for which they have a prescription .
Prosecutors will weirdly argue that there is no " prescription defense " to possessing prescribed medication .
— How about sex crimes laws ?
I predict that here too , prosecutors will overreach .
Watch , as some overzealous district attorney will charge middle school kids with sex crimes for such childhood shenanigans as slapping fellow classmates on the buttocks .
— While it continues to federalize crime and find new reasons to toss people in prison , members of Congress will simultaneously continue to attempt to put themselves above the law .
I predict that the House of Representatives will attempt to prevent police from searching the computers of one of its members , even if that member is being investigated for soliciting sex with minors .
— Public schools will teach not just reading , writing , and arithmetic , they 'll start teaching students to spy on their parents , and to report their parents to local authorities for minor violations of city codes , such as failing to recycle , or failing to keep their lawn trimmed .
— Pressed for revenue , at least one state in the country will pass draconian new traffic laws mandating fines of $ 1,000 or more for routine traffic violations , in a bald attempt to fill state treasury coffers .
The bill will be sponsored by a lawmaker who , conveniently enough , also has a law practice that specializes in defending people accused of traffic violations .
He will not disclose during the debate that the bill will almost certainly benefit him financially .
He 'll be reelected , anyway .
— A state governor will propose legislation calling for two - year prison terms for people who play online poker .
Rather shamelessly , the proposal will come in the same bill that calls for allowing the construction of three new casinos in the same state .
— While we 're talking about gambling , states will continue to crack down on the poker craze .
Even VFW posts wo n't be immune .
Soon , we 'll see cops sent to break up $ 5 cribbage games , and SWAT teams to break up charity poker games .
In fact , cops will raid bars where it merely looks like people are gambling , even if no gambling is actually taking place .
Meanwhile , states will continue to spend millions promoting their own lotteries .
— Standing on the sidewalk will become a crime .
— Cities will begin seizing the cars of people who play their stereos too loud .
In fact , they 'll seize the cars based on the word of someone else that the car 's owner was playing his stereo too loud .
— Proving there 's no part of your life the Nanny State can't reach , states will begin asking bars to install talking urinal cakes , which will warn men as they relieve themselves that drinking and driving is n't cool .
— Another state 's lawmakers will propose a bill that bans " eating , drinking , smoking , reading , writing , personal grooming , playing an instrument , interacting with pets or cargo , talking on a cell phone or using any other personal communication device " while driving .
— Two years after banning traffic cameras in the name of " liberty , " the Virginia legislature will decide that revenue is more important than liberty , and will revoke the ban .
— The FBI will imply to Congress that sometimes it has to let it 's undercover informants get away with murdering American citizens so as not to disrupt drug investigations .
— Following up on the enormous " success " ( that 's sarcasm ) of laws putting cold medicine behind the drug store counters because they can be used to make meth , legislators will propose putting baking soda behind the counter , too , because it can be used to make crack .
Too over - the top ?
Too paranoid ?
As you may have guessed from clicking the embedded links ( of if you read either of my two prior year - end columns ) , none of the bullet points above were actual predictions .
Each of the above already happened in the past 12 months , in 2007 .
Each year , government at all levels encroaches a bit more on our personal , economic , and political freedom .
Here 's one prediction that I 'm pretty confident will come true : Come December 2008 , there will be more than enough material for another column like this one .

A film adaptation of the novel also met with controversy
A parenting website said it was in " unbelievably bad taste " to give the bed the same name as a novel about a sexually precocious young girl .
Woolworths said the £ 395 Lolita Midsleeper Combi was withdrawn when the matter was brought to its attention .
Vladimir Nabokov 's 1955 novel became famous for its controversial subject .
The story of a stepfather 's sexual obsession with a 12 - year - old girl has been adapted for film twice : first by Stanley Kubrick in 1962 and later in 1997 when Jeremy Irons played the lead part of Humbert Humbert .
It has become a name that is synonymous with sexual precocity and the fact that it is tied to a girl 's bed - it literally could n't be worse taste
Catherine Hanly , parenting website editor
Catherine Hanly , editor of parenting website raisingkids.co.uk , was among the parents to complain about the furniture advertised on the Woolworths website .
She said a Woolworths press officer had told her staff running the website " had no idea " of the word 's connotations .
" I expect a company like Woolworths to actually know what it means and the connotations and stuff , " she told BBC Radio Five Live Breakfast .
" It has become a name that is synonymous with sexual precocity and the fact that it is tied to a girl 's bed - it literally could n't be worse taste . "
A Woolworths spokeswoman said : " Now this has been brought to our attention , the product has been removed from sale with immediate effect . "
She said the suppliers , who advertise the product on the Woolworths ' website , would be asked how the branding came about .
Playboy bunny
It is not the first time retailers have been criticised for using branding with sexual connotations on goods marketed for children .
In 2005 , WH Smiths came under fire for selling youngsters stationery bearing the Playboy bunny - a symbol of the pornography empire .
Prior to that Bhs decided to withdraw its Little Miss Naughty range of padded bras and knickers for pre-teen girls after attracting criticism .
Sandia and Stirling Energy Systems set new world record for solar - to - grid conversion efficiency .

On a perfect New Mexico winter day — with the sky almost 10 percent brighter than usual — Sandia National Laboratories and Stirling Energy Systems ( SES ) set a new solar - to - grid system conversion efficiency record by achieving a 31.25 percent net efficiency rate .
The old 1984 record of 29.4 percent was toppled Jan. 31 on SES ’s “ Serial # 3 ” solar dish Stirling system at Sandia ’s National Solar Thermal Test Facility .
The conversion efficiency is calculated by measuring the net energy delivered to the grid and dividing it by the solar energy hitting the dish mirrors .
Auxiliary loads , such as water pumps , computers and tracking motors , are accounted for in the net power measurement .
“ Gaining two whole points of conversion efficiency in this type of system is phenomenal , ” says Bruce Osborn , SES president and CEO .
“ This is a significant advancement that takes our dish engine systems well beyond the capacities of any other solar dish collectors and one step closer to commercializing an affordable system . ”
Serial # 3 was erected in May 2005 as part of a prototype six - dish model power plant at the Solar Thermal Test Facility that produces up to 150 kilowatts ( kW ) of grid - ready electrical power during the day .
Each dish unit consists of 82 mirrors formed in a dish shape to focus the light to an intense beam .
The solar dish generates electricity by focusing the sun ’s rays onto a receiver , which transmits the heat energy to a Stirling engine .
The engine is a sealed system filled with hydrogen .
As the gas heats and cools , its pressure rises and falls .
The change in pressure drives the pistons inside the engine , producing mechanical power , which in turn drives a generator and makes electricity .
Lead Sandia project engineer Chuck Andraka says that several technical advancements to the systems made jointly by SES and Sandia led to the record - breaking solar - to - grid conversion efficiency .
SES owns the dishes and all the hardware .
Sandia provides technical and analytical support to SES in a relationship that dates back more than 10 years .
Andraka says the first and probably most important advancement was improved optics .
The Stirling dishes are made with a low iron glass with a silver backing that make them highly reflective — focusing as much as 94 percent of the incident sunlight to the engine package , where prior efforts reflected about 91 percent .
The mirror facets , patented by Sandia and Paneltec Corp. of Lafayette , Colo. , are highly accurate and have minimal imperfections in shape .
Both improvements allow for the loss - control aperture to be reduced to seven inches in diameter — meaning light is highly concentrated as it enters the receiver .
Other advancements to the solar dish - engine system that helped Sandia and SES beat the energy conversion record were a new , more effective radiator that also costs less to build and a new high - efficiency generator .
While all the enhancements led to a better system , one aspect made it happen on a beautiful New Mexico winter day — the weather .
“ It was a ‘ perfect storm ’ of sorts , ” Andraka says .
“ We set the record on Jan. 31 , a very cold and extremely bright day , a day eight percent brighter than normal . ”
The temperature , which hovered around freezing , allowed the cold portion of the engine to operate at about 23 degrees C , and the brightness means more energy was produced while most parasitic loads and losses are constant .
The test ran for two and a half hours , and a 60 - minute running average was used to evaluate the power and efficiency data , in order to eliminate transient effects .
During the testing phase , the system produced 26.75 kW net electrical power .
Osborn says that SES is working to commercialize the record - performing system and has signed power purchase agreements with two major Southern California utilities ( Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric ) for up to 1,750 megawatts ( MW ) of power , representing the world ’s two largest solar power contracts .
Collectively , these contracts require up to 70,000 solar dish engine units .
“ This exciting record shows that using these dishes will be a cost - effective and environmentally friendly way of producing power , ” Osborn says .
“ SES is actively engaged in the commercialization of the system , called the ‘ SunCatcher , ’ including continuing to prepare it for mass production , completing project site development and preconstruction activities , and establishing partnerships with substantial manufacturing and industrial organizations to develop a cost - effective manufacturing process and supply chain .
The demonstrated high efficiency means more energy is generated for the given investment , lowering the cost of the energy delivered . ”

Dow closes up nearly 400 points Associated Press
Published : Tuesday April 1 , 2008

Print This Email This NEW YORK -- Wall Street began the second quarter with a big rally Tuesday as investors rushed back into stocks , optimistic that the worst of the credit crisis has passed and that the economy is faring better than expected .
The Dow Jones industrials surged nearly 400 points , and all the major indexes were up more than 3 percent .
Financial stocks were among the big winners after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Switzerland 's UBS AG issued new shares to help bolster their balance sheets .
With that upbeat news and a fresh quarter ahead of them , investors appear quite willing to make some bets that the worst of the damage from America 's credit struggles has been felt .
Moreover , the banks ' moves buttressed the view that financial services companies are taking aggressive action to improve their capital bases and stave off the potential of a collapse similar to Bear Stearns Cos .
Analysts believe there must be a recovery in bank and brokerage stocks to lead major stock indexes higher .
Some of the biggest financial players had their biggest moves of the year Tuesday -- Citigroup Inc. shot up 11 percent , JPMorgan Chase & Co. rose 9 percent , and Lehman surged 18 percent .

" Investors have a difficult time making decisions about the stock market if they do n't have confidence in major financial institutions , so there 's been a lot of sideline cash , " said Richard Cripps , chief market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus .
" The extreme conditions that we 've seen here over the past few months has been missing that confidence ... but that appears to be changing , and we 're seeing the response . "
Meanwhile , Wall Street got another boost when the Institute for Supply Management said its March index of national manufacturing activity rose to a reading of 48.6 -- indicating a contraction , but a slower one than in February and tamer than many analysts had predicted .
Government data on construction spending for February also came in better than expected .
The Dow rose 391.47 , or 3.19 percent , to 12,654.47 .
Broader stock indicators also gained sharply .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 index rose 47.48 , or 3.59 percent , to 1,370.18 , and the Nasdaq composite index rose 83.65 , or 3.67 percent , to 2,362.75 .
The advance was in contrast to a lackluster session on Monday , where stocks managed a moderate gain in the final session of a dismal first quarter .
Major indexes ended the first three months of 2008 with massive losses , marking the worst period since the third quarter of 2002 when Wall Street was approaching the lowest point of a protracted bear market .
Renewed enthusiasm that the credit crisis might be waning was also felt in the Treasury market , where government securities fell as investors withdrew money to take bets on stocks .
The 10 - year Treasury note 's yield , which moves opposite its price , rose to 3.55 percent from 3.43 percent late Monday .
In addition to hopes about the financial sector , Wall Street was relieved to see the feeble dollar regain some strength against the euro .
The euro fell to $ 1.5596 from $ 1.5785 late Monday in New York .
And there was also optimism that commodities prices , which have hit historic highs in recent months , have begun to retreat .
Crude fell 60 cents to settle at $ 100.98 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier falling below $ 100 .
Meanwhile , gold dropped back below $ 900 an ounce .
" This is a nice way to begin the second quarter , " said Todd Leone , managing director of equity trading at Cowen & Co .
" All the financials are up big , and there 's a sense that things are turning .
We definitely have not seen the last of the credit crisis , but we 're getting closer . "
The stock rally was underpinned by the announcements from UBS and Lehman Brothers that they are boosting capital by issuing new stock .
Shares of banks and brokerages hovered near multiyear lows in recent months as investors feared heavy losses from investments tied to subprime mortgages would be overwhelming .
Earlier this month , widespread concerns about Bear Stearns ' financial position forced the investment bank to sell itself at a bargain basement price to JPMorgan in a deal engineered by the Federal Reserve -- and that stoked fears that other investment houses might follow .
JPMorgan rose $ 4.05 , or 9.4 percent , to $ 47 ; while Bear Stearns was up 36 cents , or 3.4 percent , to $ 10.85 -- slightly above the $ 10 per share acquisition price .
UBS , one of Europe 's biggest banks , said it will issue up to $ 15 billion in new stock and that its chairman , Marcel Ospel , had quit .
Investors chose to look past the bank 's announcement that it will take a fresh $ 19 billion write - down due to additional declines in the value of its mortgage assets and other credit instruments , following an $ 18 billion write - down last year .
Its shares surged $ 4.21 , or 14.6 percent , to $ 33.01 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Lehman Brothers , dogged by speculation it might reveal losses big enough to cripple the company , on Tuesday raised $ 4 billion of capital on Tuesday to stymie questions about its financial stability .
Lehman rose $ 6.70 , or 17.8 percent , to $ 44.34 .
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 22.67 , or 3.30 percent , to 710.64 .
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange , where volume came to a heavy 1.70 billion shares .
Are n’t you just dying to tell someone at work they stink when they stink ?
A new study supports the idea of telling the truth to employees .
Oh , the management happy talk .
Be supportive .
Be collegial .
Always give feedback with a positive spin .
Are n’t you just dying to tell someone they stink when they stink ?
Are n’t there days when you just want to storm into the office in some spit - soaked , David Mamet - Glengarry Glen Ross - fueled rage and shout “ put that coffee down !
That coffee ’s for closers only ! ” ?
Your time has come , my friend .
According to new research from Northwestern ’s Kellogg School of Management and the London Business School , not only is giving phony encouragement to slackers a soul - withering experience for managers , it can also backfire and hurt the business .
According to the researchers , an employee ’s self worth gets wrapped up in the phony , esteem - boosting smoke you blow at them , which makes them try even harder to prove they ’re good at what you really know they ’re terrible at .
And then bad things happen .
“ The more that people 's feelings of self - worth are wrapped up in a poor decision they ’ve made , the greater their impulse will be to justify it in some way , ” says Daniel C. Molden , assistant professor of psychology at Northwestern and one of the authors of The Promise and Peril of Self - affirmation in De-escalation of Commitment .
Most of the study centered on financial and human - resources decisions .
In one example , participants acted as senior managers and were given copious praise for their rational decision making .
Now believing themselves to be world - class decision makers , they were then told that someone they had hired was not working out .
An overwhelming majority recommended spending additional time and money on employee training , rather than admit they made a poor call and cut their losses .
Those who were given neutral or negative feedback about their overall decision making had no problem cutting the troublesome new hire loose .

REUTERS / Stringer
HONG KONG / BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Chinese authorities appeared to have lifted a block on the English - language version of online encyclopedia Wikipedia , but politically sensitive topics such as Tibet and Tiananmen Square are still off limits .
Internet users in Beijing and Shanghai confirmed on Saturday that they could access the English - language version of one of the world ’s most popular websites , but the Chinese language version was still restricted .
While searches of random topics such as “ Johann Sebastian Bach ” and “ dim sum ” brought up English - language articles , sensitive words such as Tibet were met with a message that the browser was unable to connect to the Internet .
The move comes after International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) inspectors told Beijing organizers that the Internet must be open for the duration of the 2008 Olympics and that blocking it “ would reflect very poorly ” on the host country .
China ’s government , keen to avoid sparking social discontent , keeps a tight watch over the media and often blocks or censors popular Web sites and forums where dissent may brew .
Wikipedia and Yahoo ’s photo - sharing network Flickr have been periodically blocked before , while Google ’s YouTube is often blocked during high - level political events in China .
Wikipedia , which is written collaboratively by volunteers , has more than 2 million articles in English .
These include politically sensitive subjects such as Tibet and Taiwan independence , the banned Falun Gong spiritual group and the bloodily suppressed pro-democracy protests of 1989 .
The full lunar eclipse on Wednesday night , Feb. 20 – the last visible here for almost three years – will happen at a perfect time for viewing in most of the United States .
Assuming the weather cooperates .
On the West Coast , partial eclipse will begin about 5:45 pm , just as the moon is rising .
The full eclipse will begin at about 7:00 pm and last nearly an hour .
Partial eclipse will end again a few minutes after nine o'clock .
Adjust those times for the same moment in different time zones – three hours later on the East Coast , eight hours later in Britain , for example .
Unlike solar eclipses , for which the best observation point travels as the relative positions of the moon and Earth change , a lunar eclipse is visible to everyone on the moon - facing side of the Earth at the same time .
Sky and Telescope has a good article outlining precisely what happens during a lunar eclipse , including an explanation of why the moon glows slightly red during the total eclipse .
Essentially , the red and orange light of sunrises and sunsets bend through the atmosphere at the edge of the globe ( as seen from the moon ) , sending a ruddy glow to illuminate the darkened lunar surface .
North and South America , and Western Europe and Africa all will have good views of this eclipse .
The next full eclipse wo n't happen until late December , 2010 .

Montana governor Brian Schweitzer declared victory Friday after the
Department of Homeland Security sent his state an extension to the Real ID act , despite his insistence Montana will never comply with a mandate he describes as a " boondoggle . "
Montana governor Brian Schweitzer says he won the Real ID stare down with DHS chief Michael Chertoff .
Photo : Montana Governor 's Office " If I were writing the headline , it would be ' DHS Blinks , " Schweitzer , a Democrat , told
THREAT LEVEL by phone late Friday .
Montana 's attorney general sent DHS chief Michael Chertoff a letter ( .pdf ) Friday outlining the security features in Montana 's current driver 's licenses , which
DHS threatened to reject as valid I.D. for boarding airplanes or entering federal buildings come May 11 unless the state promised to comply with Real ID .
DHS responded by interpreting that letter as a request for an extension ( .pdf ) of the
Real ID deadlines until 2010 , reversing its previous position that Montana ID cards would be rejected by federal agents .
" I sent them a horse and if they want to call it a zebra , that 's up to them , "
Schweitzer said .
" They can call it whatever they want , and it was n't a love letter . "
Schweitzer emphasized that his state 's licenses already contain holograms , secure digital photographs and a magnetic stripe on the back .
But says he has no intention of sharing his state 's residents ' data with the federal government , as required by Real ID .
The information the government wants the states to keep and share in Real ID is ripe for abuse , despite the government 's privacy and security promises , he said .
" They tell us our data is safe , " Schweitzer said .
" You tell that to the passport people , " he said , referring to news that State Department employees
snooped in all three major presidential candidates ' passport files .
" Do you want your government to have the ability to track where you went , how you got there and when you got home ? "
Schweitzer asked .
" It would be naïve for someone to think this information will not be abused in the future .
Virtually every decade these kinds of files have been used to violate people 's privacy . "
" We already have an ID system they are hoping to get to in seven years , "
Schweitzer said .
Adding more scorn to the heap , the outspoken governor called Real ID an empty notion and said that DHS is n't even likely to be around in seven years when the final phase of Real ID is scheduled to go into effect .
Schweitzer said he sent the letter to Chertoff " just to keep the guy happy .
He seems so grumpy all the time .
It does n't mean anything . "
The governor said he and Chertoff spoke on the phone a few weeks ago , and Schweitzer outlined a scenario where he and the secretary are on the CBS news program 60
Minutes , days after DHS starts patting down Montana driver 's license holders trying to get on planes .
" I said , ' Montana already has the most secure licenses in America , and the Real
ID will not exist for seven years , so they are going to single Montana out .
They admit we have one of the most secure ID systems and they singled us out because
I would n't sign on to a concept . ' "
" ' Now ... your turn ' , I said .
And then Chertoff said , ' I see the problem .
We need to get this fixed . ' "
And that , according to Schweitzer , is how a state that is determined never to comply with Real ID got a Real ID extension .

Looking Up
Normalizing Air War from Guernica to Arab Jabour
By Tom Engelhardt
A January 21st Los Angeles Times Iraq piece by Ned Parker and Saif Rasheed led with an inter-tribal suicide bombing at a gathering in Fallujah in which members of the pro-American Anbar Awakening Council were killed .
( " Asked why one member of his Albu Issa tribe would kill another , Aftan compared it to school shootings that happen in the United States . " )
Twenty - six paragraphs later , the story ended this way :
" The U.S. military also said in a statement that it had dropped 19,000 pounds of explosives on the farmland of Arab Jabour south of Baghdad .
The strikes targeted buried bombs and weapons caches .
" In the last 10 days , the military has dropped nearly 100,000 pounds of explosives on the area , which has been a gateway for Sunni militants into Baghdad . "
And here 's paragraph 22 of a 34 - paragraph January 22nd story by Stephen Farrell of the New York Times :
" The threat from buried bombs was well known before the [ Arab Jabour ] operation .
To help clear the ground , the military had dropped nearly 100,000 pounds of bombs to destroy weapons caches and I.E.D.'s . "
Farrell led his piece with news that an American soldier had died in Arab Jabour from an IED that blew up " an MRAP , the new Mine - Resistant Ambush - Protected armored vehicle that the American military is counting on to reduce casualties from roadside bombs in Iraq . "
Note that both pieces started with bombing news -- in one case a suicide bombing that killed several Iraqis ; in another a roadside bombing that killed an American soldier and wounded others .
But the major bombing story of these last days -- those 100,000 pounds of explosives that U.S. planes dropped in a small area south of Baghdad -- simply dangled unexplained off the far end of the Los Angeles Times piece ; while , in the New York Times , it was buried inside a single sentence .
Neither paper has ( as far as I know ) returned to the subject , though this is undoubtedly the most extensive use of air power in Iraq since the Bush administration 's invasion of 2003 and probably represents a genuine shifting of American military strategy in that country .
Despite a few humdrum wire service pieces , no place else in the mainstream has bothered to cover the story adequately either .
For those who know something about the history of air power , which , since World War II , has been lodged at the heart of the American Way of War , that 100,000 figure might have rung a small bell .
On April 26 , 1937 , in the midst of the Spanish Civil War ( a prelude to World War II ) , the planes of the German Condor Legion attacked the ancient Basque town of Guernica .
They came in waves , first carpet bombing , then dropping thermite incendiaries .
It was a market day and there may have been as many as 7,000 - 10,000 people , including refugees , in the town which was largely destroyed in the ensuing fire storm .
More than 1,600 people may have died there ( though some estimates are lower ) .
The Germans reputedly dropped about 50 tons or 100,000 pounds of explosives on the town .
In the seven decades between those two 100,000 figures lies a sad history of our age .
Arab Jabour , the Sunni farming community about 10 miles south of the Iraqi capital that was the target of the latest 100,000 - pound barrage has recently been largely off - limits to American troops and their Iraqi allies .
The American military now refers generically to all Sunni insurgents who resist them as " al Qaeda , " so in situations like this it's hard to tell exactly who has held this territory .
At Guernica , as in Arab Jabour 71 years later , no reporters were present when the explosives rained down .
In the Spanish situation , however , four reporters in the nearby city of Bilbao , including George Steer of the Times of London , promptly rushed to the scene of destruction .
Steer 's first piece for the Times ( also printed in the New York Times ) was headlined " The Tragedy of Guernica " and called the assault " unparalleled in military history . "
( Obviously , no such claims could be made for Arab Jabour today . )
Steer made clear in his report that this had been an attack on a civilian population , essentially a terror bombing .
The self - evident barbarism of the event -- the first massively publicized bombing of a civilian population -- caused international horror .
It was news across the planet .
From it came perhaps the most famous painting of the last century , Picasso's Guernica , as well as innumerable novels , plays , poems , and other works of art .
As Ian Patterson writes in his book , Guernica and Total War :
" Many attacks since then , including the ones we have grown used to seeing in Iraq and the Middle East in recent years , have been on such a scale that Guernica 's fate seems almost insignificant by comparison .
But it 's almost impossible to overestimate the outrage it caused in 1937 Accounts of the bombing were widely printed in the American press , and provoked a great deal of anger and indignation in most quarters "
Those last two tag - on paragraphs in the Parker and Rasheed Los Angeles Times piece tell us much about the intervening 71 years , which included the German bombing of Rotterdam and the blitz of London as well as other English cities ; the Japanese bombings of Shanghai and other Chinese cities ; the Allied fire - bombing of German and Japanese cities ; the U.S. atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ; the Cold War era of mutually assured destruction ( MAD ) in which two superpowers threatened to use the ultimate in airborne explosives to incinerate the planet ; the massive , years - long U.S. bombing campaigns against North Korea and later North and South Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia ; the American air power " victories " of Gulf War I and Afghanistan ( 2001 ) ; and the Bush administration 's shock - and - awe , air - and - cruise - missile assault on Baghdad in March 2003 , which , though meant to " decapitate " the regime of Saddam Hussein , killed not a single Iraqi governmental or Baath Party figure , only Iraqi civilians .
In those seven decades , the death toll and damage caused by war -- on the ground and from the air -- has increasingly been delivered to civilian populations , while the United States has come to rely on its Air Force to impose its will in war .
One hundred thousand pounds of explosives delivered from the air is now , historically speaking , a relatively modest figure .
During the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , a single air wing from the USS Kitty Hawk , an aircraft carrier stationed in the Persian Gulf , did that sort of damage in less than a day and it was a figure that , as again last week , the military was proud to publicize without fear of international outrage or the possibility that " barbarism " might come to mind :
" From Tuesday afternoon through early Wednesday the air wing flew 69 dedicated strike missions in Basra and in and around Baghdad , involving 27 F / A - 18 Hornets and 12 Tomcats .
They dropped nearly 100,000 pounds of ordnance , said Lt. Brook DeWalt , Kitty Hawk public affairs officer . "
As far as we know , there were no reporters , Iraqi or Western , in Arab Jabour when the bombs fell and , Iraq being Iraq , no American reporters rushed there -- in person or by satellite phone -- to check out the damage .
In Iraq and Afghanistan , when it comes to the mainstream media , bombing is generally only significant if it's of the roadside or suicide variety ; if , that is , the " bombs " can be produced at approximately " the cost of a pizza " ( as IEDs sometimes are ) , or if the vehicles delivering them are cars or simply fiendishly well - rigged human bodies .
From the air , even 100,000 pounds of bombs just does n't have the ring of something that matters .
Some of this , of course , comes from the Pentagon 's success in creating a dismissive , sanitizing language in which to frame war from the air .
" Collateral damage " stands in for the civilian dead -- even though in much of modern war , the collateral damage could be considered the dead soldiers , not the ever rising percentage of civilian casualties .
And death is , of course , delivered " precisely " by " precision - guided " weaponry .
All this makes air war seem sterile , even virginal .
Army Col. Terry Ferrell , for instance , described the air assaults in Arab Jabour in this disembodied way at a Baghdad news conference :
" The purpose of these particular strikes was to shape the battlefield and take out known threats before our ground troops move in .
Our aim was to neutralize any advantage the enemy could claim with the use of IEDs and other weapons . "
Reports -- often hard to assess for credibility -- have nonetheless seeped out of the region indicating that there were civilian casualties , possibly significant numbers of them ; that bridges and roads were " cut off " and undoubtedly damaged ; that farms and farmlands were damaged or destroyed .
According to Hamza Hendawi of the Associated Press , for instance , Iraqi and American troops were said to have advanced into Arab Jabour , already much damaged from years of fighting , through " smoldering citrus groves . "
But how could there not be civilian casualties and property damage ?
After all , the official explanation for this small - scale version of a " shock - and - awe " campaign in a tiny rural region was that American troops and allied Iraqi forces had been strangers to the area for a while , and that the air - delivered explosives were meant to damage local infrastructure -- by exploding roadside bombs and destroying weapons caches or booby traps inside existing structures .
As that phrase " take out known threats before our ground troops move in " made clear , this was an attempt to minimize casualties among American ( and allied Iraqi ) troops by bringing massive amounts of firepower to bear in a situation in which local information was guaranteed to be sketchy at best .
Given such a scenario , civilians will always suffer .
And this , increasingly , is likely to be the American way of war in Iraq .
The ABCs of Air War in Iraq
So let 's focus , for a moment , on American air power in Iraq and gather together a little basic information you 're otherwise not likely to find in one place .
In these last years , the Pentagon has invested billions of dollars in building up an air - power infrastructure in and around Iraq .
As a start , it constructed one of its largest foreign bases anywhere on the planet about 80 kilometers north of Baghdad .
Balad Air Base has been described by Newsweek as a " 15 - square - mile mini-city of thousands of trailers and vehicle depots , " whose air fields handle 27,500 takeoffs and landings every month .
Reputedly " second only to London 's Heathrow Airport in traffic worldwide , " it is said to handle congestion similar to that of Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport .
With about 140,000 tons a year of cargo moving through it , the base is " the busiest aerial port " in the global domains of the Department of Defense .
It is also simply massive , housing about 40,000 military personnel , private contractors of various sorts , and Pentagon civilian employees .
It has its own bus routes , fast - food restaurants , sidewalks , and two PXs that are the size of K - Marts .
It also has its own neighborhoods including , reported the Washington Post 's Thomas Ricks , " KBR - land " for civilian contractors and " CJSOTF " ( Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force ) , " home to a special operations unit [ that ] is hidden by especially high walls . "
Radar traffic controllers at the base now commonly see " more than 550 aircraft operations in just one day . "
To the tune of billions of dollars , Balad 's runways and other facilities have been , and continue to be , upgraded for years of further wear and tear .
According to the military press , construction is to begin this month on a $ 30 million " state - of - the - art battlefield command and control system [ at Balad ] that will integrate air traffic management throughout Iraq . "
National Public Radio's Defense Correspondent Guy Raz paid a visit to the base last year and termed it " a giant construction site [ T ] he sounds of construction and the hum of generators seem to follow visitors everywhere .
Seen from the sky at night , the base resembles Las Vegas :
While the surrounding Iraqi villages get about 10 hours of electricity a day , the lights never go out at Balad Air Base . "
This gargantuan feat of construction is designed for the military long haul .
As Josh White of the Washington Post reported recently in a relatively rare ( and bland ) summary piece on the use of air power in Iraq , there were five times as many U.S. air strikes in 2007 as in 2006 ; and 2008 has , of course , started off with a literal bang from those 100,000 pounds of explosives dropped southeast of Baghdad .
That poundage assumedly includes the 40,000 pounds of explosives that got modest headlines for being delivered in a mere 10 minutes in the Arab Jabour area the previous week , but not the 16,500 pounds of explosives that White reports being used north of Baghdad in approximately the same period ; nor , evidently , another 15,000 pounds of explosives dropped on Arab Jabour more recently .
( And none of these numbers seem to include Marine Corps figures for Iraq , which have evidently not been released . )
Who could forget all the attention that went into the President 's surge strategy on the ground in the first half of last year ?
But which media outlet even noticed , until recently , what Bob Deans of Cox News Service has termed the " air surge " that accompanied those 30,000 surging troops into the Iraqi capital and environs ?
In that same period , air units were increasingly concentrated in and around Iraq .
By mid-2007 , for instance , the Associated Press was already reporting :
" [ S ] quadrons of attack planes have been added to the in-country fleet .
The air reconnaissance arm has almost doubled since last year .
The powerful B1 - B bomber has been recalled to action over Iraq Early this year , with little fanfare , the Air Force sent a squadron of A - 10 ' Warthog ' attack planes -- a dozen or more aircraft -- to be based at Al - Asad Air Base in western Iraq .
At the same time it added a squadron of F - 16C Fighting Falcons at Balad . "
Meanwhile , in the last year , aircraft - carrier battle groups have been stationed in greater numbers in the Persian Gulf and facilities at sites near Iraq like the huge al - Udeid Air Base in Qatar continue to be upgraded .
Even these increases do not tell the whole story of the expanding air war .
Lolita Baldor of the Associated Press reported recently that " the military 's reliance on unmanned aircraft that can watch , hunt and sometimes kill insurgents has soared to more than 500,000 hours in the air , largely in Iraq . "
The use of such unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , including Hellfire - missile armed Predators , doubled in the first ten months of 2007 -- with Predator air hours increasing from 2,000 to 4,300 in that period .
The Army alone , according to Baldor , now has 361 drones in action in Iraq .
The future promises much more of the same .
American military spokespeople and administration officials have , over the years , decried Iraqi and Afghan insurgents for " hiding " behind civilian populations -- in essence , accusing them of both immorality and cowardice .
When such spokespeople do admit to inflicting " collateral damage " on civilian populations , they regularly blame the guerrillas for turning civilians into " shields . "
And all of this is regularly , dutifully reported in our press .
On the other hand , no one in our world considers drone warfare in a similar context , though armed UAVs like the Predators and the newer , even more heavily armed Reapers are generally " flown " by pilots stationed at computer consoles in places like Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas .
It is from there that they release their missiles against " anti-Iraqi forces " or the Taliban , causing civilian deaths in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
As one American pilot , who has fired Predator missiles from Nellis , put it :
" I go from the gym and step inside Afghanistan , or Iraq
It takes some getting used to it .
At Nellis you have to remind yourself , ' I 'm not at the Nellis Air Force Base .
Whatever issues I had 30 minutes ago , like talking to my bank , are n't important anymore . ' "
To American reporters , this seems neither cowardly , nor in any way barbaric , just plain old normal .
Those pilots are not said to be " hiding " in distant deserts or among the civilian gamblers of Caesar 's Palace .
Anyway , here 's the simple calculus that goes with all this : Militarily , overstretched American forces simply cannot sustain the ground part of the surge for much longer .
Most , if not all , of those 30,000 troops who surged into Iraq in the first half of 2007 will soon be coming home .
But air power wo n't be .
Air Force personnel are already on short , rotating tours of duty in the region .
In Vietnam back in the late 1960s and early 1970s , as ground troops were withdrawn , air power ramped up .
This seems once again to be the pattern .
There is every reason to believe that it represents the American future in Iraq .
From Barbarism to the Norm
The air war is simply not visible to most Americans who depend on the mainstream media .
In part , this is because American reporters , who have covered every other sort of warfare in Iraq , simply refuse to look up .
It should be no surprise then that news of a future possible escalation of the air war was first raised by a journalist who had never set foot in Iraq and so could n't look up .
In a December 2005 piece entitled " Up in the Air , " New Yorker investigative reporter Seymour Hersh suggested that " a key element of [ any ] drawdown plans , not mentioned in the President 's public statements , is that the departing American troops will be replaced by American airpower
The danger , military experts have told me , is that , while the number of American casualties would decrease as ground troops are withdrawn , the over - all level of violence and the number of Iraqi fatalities would increase unless there are stringent controls over who bombs what . "
After Hersh broke his story , the silence was deafening .
Only one reporter , as far as I know , has even gone up in a plane -- David S. Cloud of the New York Times , who flew in a B - 1 from an unnamed " Middle Eastern airfield " on a mission over Afghanistan .
Thomas Ricks traveled to Balad Air Base and did a superb report on it in 2006 , but no reporter seems to have bothered to hang out with American pilots , nor have the results of bombing , missile - firing , or strafing been much recorded in our press .
The air war is still largely relegated to passing mentions of air raids , based on Pentagon press releases or announcements , in summary pieces on the day 's news from Iraq .
Given American military history since 1941 , this is all something of a mystery .
A Marine patrol rampaging through an Iraqi village can , indeed , be news ; but American bombs or missiles turning part of a city into rubble or helicopter gunships riddling part of a neighborhood is , at best , tag - on , inside - the - fold material -- a paragraph or two , as in this AP report on the latest fighting in an undoubtedly well - populated part of the city of Mosul :
" An officer , speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information , said three civilians were wounded and helicopters had bombarded buildings in the southeastern Sumar neighborhood , which has seen frequent attacks on U.S. and Iraqi forces that have led to a series of raids . "
The predictably devastating results of helicopters " bombarding " an urban neighborhood in a major Iraqi city , if reported at all , will be treated as just the normal " collateral damage " of war as we know it .
In our world , what was once the barbarism of air war , its genuine horror , has been transformed into humdrum ordinariness ( if , of course , you do n't happen to be an Iraqi or an Afghan on the receiving end ) , the stuff of largely ignored Air Force news releases .
It is as unremarkable ( and as American ) as apple pie , and nothing worth writing home to mom and the kids about .
Maybe then , it 's time for Seymour Hersh to take another look .
Or for the online world to take up the subject .
Maybe , sooner or later , American mainstream journalists in Iraq ( and editors back in the U.S. ) will actually look up , notice those contrails in the skies , register those " precision " bombs and missiles landing , and consider whether it really is a ho-hum , no -news period when the U.S. Air Force looses 100,000 pounds of explosives on a farming district on the edge of Baghdad .
Maybe artists will once again begin pouring their outrage over the very nature of air war into works of art , at least one of which will become iconic , and travel the world reminding us just what , almost five years later , the " liberation " of Iraq has really meant for Iraqis .
In the meantime , brace yourself .
Air war is on the way .
Tom Engelhardt , who runs the Nation Institute 's Tomdispatch.com , is the co-founder of the American Empire Project .
His book , The End of Victory Culture ( University of Massachusetts Press ) , has been thoroughly updated in a newly issued edition that deals with victory culture 's crash - and - burn sequel in Iraq .
[ Note on Air - War Readings : The Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) published a study in December 2007 on the air war in Iraq , which can be read by clicking here ( PDF file ) .
Figures on the rising intensity of air power in that country can be found there -- of a sort that the Washington Post only recently reported on .
For some historical background on U.S. air power and the bombing of noncombatants , I suggest checking out Mark Selden 's " A Forgotten Holocaust . "
Those who , in these years , wanted to find out something substantive about the air war in Iraq had to look to independent sites on line .
At Tomdispatch , I began writing on the air war in 2004 .
See , for instance , " Icarus ( armed with Vipers ) Over Iraq " ; others have taken up the subject at this site since : See Dahr Jamail 's " Living Under the Bombs " ; Nick Turse 's " Bombs Over Baghdad , The Pentagon 's Secret Air War in Iraq " and " Did the U.S. Lie about Cluster Bomb Use in Iraq " ( both of which involved the sort of reporting , long distance , that American journalists should have been doing in Iraq ) ; and Michael Schwartz 's " A Formula for Slaughter : The American Rules of Engagement from the Air , " among other pieces .

Red - faced Clinton tirade stuns superdelegates behind closed doors RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday April 2 , 2008

This A private meeting between Bill Clinton and California superdelegates erupted when the former president was reminded of Bill Richardson 's decision to endorse Barack Obama .
" It was like someone pulled the pin from a grenade , " according to San Francisco Chronicle columnists Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross .
" ' Five times to my face ( Richardson ) said that he would never do that , ' a red- faced , finger - pointing Clinton erupted , " the two write in Wednesday 's paper .
Clinton " was a far cry " from the " congenial former president " who told fellow delegates to " chill out " over the race between his wife and Illinois Senator Barack Obama .
" It was one of the worst political meetings I have ever attended , " one superdelegate said .
According to those at the meeting , Clinton - who flew in from Chicago with bags under his eyes - was classic old Bill at first , charming and making small talk with the 15 or so delegates who gathered in a room behind the convention stage .
But as the group moved together for the perfunctory photo , Rachel Binah , a former Richardson delegate who now supports Hillary Clinton , told Bill how " sorry " she was to have heard former Clinton campaign manager James Carville call Richardson a " Judas " for backing Obama .
It was as if someone pulled the pin from a grenade .
" Five times to my face ( Richardson ) said that he would never do that , " a red- faced , finger - pointing Clinton erupted .
The former president then went on a tirade that ran from the media 's unfair treatment of Hillary to questions about the fairness of the votes in state caucuses that voted for Obama .
It ended with him asking delegates to imagine what the reaction would be if Obama was trailing by just 1 percent and people were telling him to drop out .
" It was very , very intense , " said one attendee .
" Not at all like the Bill of earlier campaigns . "
" It was kind of strange later when he took the stage and told everyone to ' chill out , ' " one delegate told us .
" We could n't help but think he was also talking to himself . "
Hi Guys
As you probably know , currently only shaven pussies attract a specific attribute flag on the sets and models - I 'm giving serious thought to adding two more attributes / icons - trimmed and hairy - such that each and every set is flagged as appropriate to the models appearing in it .
In the case of lesbian sets , if both attributes could appear inferred from each model 's respective attributes .
The updateinfo would import the new attributes rapidly into the existing back catalogue of sets , and I can make changes to ensure that the model details are similarly auto - imported , or leave it to be done manually when updating model details .
What do you think of this idea ?
Cheers , Beaky .
Critics of the Fox News Channel regularly complain that the network beats up on Democrats and takes comments out of context .
Usually , though , those critics are not Fox anchors .
On Friday Chris Wallace , host of the weekend political talk show “ Fox News Sunday , ” took the hosts of “ Fox & Friends ” to task for their conversations about Senator Barack Obama ’s comments about race .
His complaint  which created both a tense moment and some must - see TV  was that his colleagues were taking those comments out of context .
On Tuesday , in a speech that dominated the week ’s news , Mr. Obama referred his white grandmother , saying that she had felt nervous passing black men on the street .
On Thursday , while trying to clarify his remarks , he called his grandmother a “ typical white person . ”
On Friday , the “ Fox & Friends ” hosts questioned whether Mr. Obama ’s remarks about his grandmother had been offensive  a process that involved playing the “ typical white person ” quote over and over again  and two of the three hosts seemed to say that they were .
Mr. Wallace came on during the third hour of the program to say that the hosts had too often clipped the quote and played it in isolation .
Electronics engineers are facing a constant challenge , creating usable and small technology .
If we jump back to the 1970s , the first computers took up an entire room and did a fraction of what your smartphone can do today .
If you take a moment to think about it , that ’s a lot of technology in one tiny device .
Yet , more people and companies are demanding smaller devices from electronics engineers .
Engineers use a printed circuit board , or PCB layout to help with the design process .
This is what allows them to efficiently create a compact circuit board to reduce the size of most electronics .
But a PCB layout is only one small piece of the design puzzle .
The methods you use to design and test a PCB is the bigger part of the puzzle .
Check out these 10 design tips to save time and improve your PCB layout .
1. Make DFM a Priority With PCB Layout
The DFM or design for manufacturing , are guidelines focused on the making the production of the end product ’s components .
The priority of a DFM is to determine the most economical processes and materials needed to manufacture the components .
Besides improving manufacturing , the DFM also prevents several issues such as errors and save you time .
This makes the DFM one of the most important steps in your PCB design process .
There are 5 principles to the DFM .
They are :
Process
Design
Material
Environment
Compliance and Testing
Using the DFM and the 5 above principles will help you design the circuit board with more efficiency .
Include stakeholders , designers , engineers , and manufacturers to look at the PCB layout design from all angles to create the best possible design .
There are also many special offers on parts and components .
2. Know the PCB Size and Shape
With the DFM in mind , the next step is determining the size and shape of the PCB .
You can find PCBs shaped as triangles , circles , squares , or other unique shapes depending on their use .
In most cases , the size of the piece of technology , or the enclosure , will determine the size and shape of the PCB .
You will need the measurements of the enclosure to ensure your PCB will fit .
Also , consider the components you will be using .
Components that attach to the surface of the PCB are flatter and smaller .
Through - hole components are other options that are easier to find and use , but tend to be a larger size .
3. Begin With a Schematic Design
Now you ’re ready to draft a schematic design of the PCB layout .
This design will serve as a reference or blueprint throughout the entire design process .
Your schematic design shows you what components you ’re using in your PCB design and how those components connect together .
The schematic also shows how different groups of components relate to other groups .
Using a schematic will make identifying , building , and editing your design faster and easier .
It will make complex PCB layouts easier to understand and organize as well .
4. Build a Blank PCB Layout
When you start building , begin with a blank PCB layout .
To make this step quick and easy , you will need a PCB design software tool .
This software lets you see how the electrical circuits will work and how to lay them out .
But before you start adding circuits and components , crate a blank PCB document .
You can set the dimensions , layers , and compile the PCB document with the schematics document .
5. Divide Your Circuit Board for Space Optimization
Organization is key to a successful PCB layout that takes up as little space as possible .
Break up your circuit board into different sections based on function .
Have one section for power , another for memory , and so on .
Grouping components in each section together closely will keep the traces shorter preventing them from picking up noise or interference .
6. Designing the Stackup
When you ’re working with larger circuits , there ’s a good chance you ’ll need more than a single PCB layer .
To optimize space and prevent traces from crossing , you can design a multi layer PCB .
A popular design strategy is to place one copper layer on a solder mask , layer it with a substrate , and then place the second copper layer on top .
You then would top the entire circuit with another solder mask .
You can connect layers with vias .
7. Placing Components
As you organize the circuit board , PCB software can help you decide where to place the components .
You can place them manually or automatically .
Or , use both options to help with speed while also following component placement guidelines .
As you place the components , make sure to follow your schematic .
You ’ll also want to place them in a way that keeps electrical paths and traces as straight and short as possible .
8. Placing Drill Holes
For some , it ’s tempting to start routing traces as you attach your mountings and vias .
You can , however , save time and minimize error by placing drill holes and mountings first .
This ensures everything will fit properly , and if a component does n’t fit right , you can fix it .
This is particularly important for those working on complicated PCB layouts .
Your PCB software will also check design rules and help guide you through this process .
9. Routing Traces
With your components and vias in place , you can start laying traces .
You want your traces to stay as straight as possible .
If you they need to change direction , stick to 45° angles .
Take advantage of your PCB software as it can help make this step more productive and easier when working on complicated circuit boards .
10 . Label and File
With your PCB layout complete , you can start adding labels and identifiers to the circuit board .
This also includes adding images and logos .
You may want to consult a designer or PCB manufacturer to pick fonts that are readable .
Once you finish labeling , you can run a DRC or design rule check .
The DRC checks the circuit board for any potential issues that affect its functionality .
If the PCB layout passes , you can pass it to the manufacturer .
Improve Your PCB Design
Designing an effective PCB layout does n’t have to be a complicated process .
With these 10 helpful tips , you ’ll improve your PCB designs , save time , and ensure manufacturability .

At the start of the annual Fairtrade Fortnight , a highly critical report by the Adam Smith Institute ( ASI ) warns that it is little more than a marketing exercise intended to maintain fair trade 's predominance in an increasingly competitive marketplace .
It says fair trade is " unfair " because if offers only a very small number of farmers a higher , fixed priced for their goods .
These higher prices come at the expense of the great majority of farmers , it says , who - unable to qualify for Fairtrade certification - are left even worse off .
Fair trade products will be showcased by retailers in the coming fortnight , as new figures show that British shoppers ' interest in fair trade has more than doubled in the past five years .
Analysts IGD report that nearly a quarter of shoppers claim to have recently bought fair trade products , up from 11 % in 2003 .
IGD predicts growth in annual fair trade spending will average 11 % over the next five years to total £ 585 m by 2012 .
Gerardine Padbury , senior consumer analyst at IGD , said : " People are taking a renewed interest in where their food comes from and how it is produced . "
She said fair trade sales were likely to remain strong in an economic downturn , with only 6 % of shoppers saying they will cut back on ethical purchasing because of a tighter household budget .
But the ASI report , Unfair Trade , by Marc Sidwell , says there are many " inconvenient truths " about the movement .
It says many of the farmers helped by fair trade are in Mexico , a relatively developed country , while few are in places like Ethiopia .
It claims that four - fifths of the produce sold by Fairtrade - certified farmers ends up in non-fair trade goods , and typically just 10 % of the premium consumers pay for fair trade actually goes to the producer .
The ASI 's policy director , Tom Clougherty , said : " At best , fair trade is a marketing device that does the poor little good .
At worst , it may inadvertently be harming some of the planet 's most vulnerable people .
" If we really want to aid international development , we should instead work to abolish barriers to trade in the rich world , and help the developing world to the same .
Free trade is the most effective poverty reduction strategy the world has ever seen . "
But Harriet Lamb , director of the Fairtrade Foundation , said : " Fair trade is already making a big difference to the lives of more than seven million people in the developing world , but there are millions more we 'd like to reach .
2007 was a phenomenal year of growth for fair trade bananas , for example , with one in every five bananas bought from supermarkets now Fairtrade certified .
On the other hand , this means four in five bananas still are n't fair trade , and we 're determined to change those odds . "
Ammon Shea recently spent a year of his life reading the OED from start to finish .
Over the next few months he will be posting weekly blogs about the insights , gems , and thoughts on language that came from this experience .
His book , Reading the OED , is out now .
All dictionaries have mistakes .
Ghost words creep in , there are occasional misspellings , or perhaps the printer was hung over one day and misplaced some punctuation .
In addition to these normal forms of human error there are others that are created by language , as it continues its inexorable change , rendering definitions and spellings obsolete .
Furthermore , as the science of lexicography itself advances , certain things , such as etymologies , that made sense a hundred years ago , begin to look suspect in a modern light .
The OED is certainly not exempt from this immutable aspect of lexicography – it does have errors , although I like to think that it has less than its fair share .
As the entire thing is now being edited I ’ve seen those few errors that I noted disappearing from its text .
I do n’t begrudge the editors their desire to improve the dictionary , and I ’m happy to see the errors removed .
But there is another type of entry that is also being edited out , and although it makes sense to continue with these removals , I ’m saddened to see them go .
I am referring to the Absurd Entries .
Absurd Entries is the name that I gave to a certain class of definition that I would come across every so often when reading the OED .
They are rarer than the mistakes , and considerably more fun to read .
These are the extremely rare moments when the OED does something that is so inexplicable that you have to close the book and check the cover to make sure that it is indeed the same book that you thought .
I have decided , without giving too much thought to the matter , to divide them into two separate categories : ‘ Blatant Disregard for the Reader ’s Level of Education ’ and ‘ What Were They Thinking ? ’
In the category of Blatant Disregard , the past editors of the OED had seemingly come to the conclusion that since they sat around all day reading about words , accruing a monstrous knowledge of vocabulary , their readers must have done the same , and therefore it was not necessary to talk down to anyone with the definition .
For instance trondhjemite is defined as ‘ Any leucocratic tonalite , esp. one in which the plagioclase is oligoclase ’ .
I have my doubts as to whether anyone has ever thought to themselves ‘ I wonder what trondhjemite means ? ’
But if someone did , and went to look it up in the OED , it seems unlikely that this definition would clear things up much .
In a similar vein , self - feeling is defined as ‘ used to render coenaethesis ’ , and occupatio is simply ‘ preterition ’ .
( I should add that in the online version both coenaethesis and preterition are linked to definitions , which feels a bit like cheating . )
The word syllogism has a fairly simple and informative definition , and the OED even thoughtfully provides an example of a syllogism at the end of it .
Which is written entirely in Latin .
Although for sheer incomprehensibility , I do not think that I have seen many entries that can beat the masterful one that was created for the curious word disghibelline – ‘ To distinguish , as a Guelph from a Ghibelline . ’
Although it was amusing to read these entries , they could also be demoralizing , leaving me feeling as though I was less educated after reading the dictionary .
The entries in the category of ‘ What were they thinking ’ merely made me laugh , albeit in a confused sort of way .
For instance , the delightful word rufty - tufty , which starts out with a well - crafted and succinct definition in sense ‘ a’ ( ‘ Rude , rough ’ ) and then seems to veer into sing - song nonsense with sense ‘ b’ ( ‘ Hey - day , hoity - toity ’ ) .
Unberufen is treated in a similarly fantastic fashion , with its entire definition reading as follows : ‘‘ Touch wood ! ’ ( TOUCH v. 29 b ) . ’
In a rather unconventional bit of lexicography the word scindapse has no definition at all , but there is a nice little etymology which informs the reader that it comes from a Greek word which means ‘ a ‘ thingumbob ’ , a what - d’ ye - call - it . ’
I ’ll confess that on several occasions I thought that the editors of the OED were having a joke at the reader ’s expense .
The entry for unpoetic gives no definition , but there is a note that tells the reader to ‘ cf. next . ’
The reader dutifully looks ahead to the next entry which is unpoetical , the definition of which reads ‘ cf. prev . ’
Or when James Murray used a list of eight different words to define a single sense of the word cannily ( ‘ Sagaciously , skilfully , prudently ; cautiously , slyly ; gently , softly ; comfortably ’ ) and then tacked on an etc. at the end , for good measure .
I am afraid that as the edit of the OED continues , these bits of absurdity will be excised , along with any outright errors that the editors find .
It will obviously be an improvement , at least in terms of improving the clarity of these definitions .
Yet the whimsical anthropomorphizer in me is sad to see that murinoid has had its definition changed from ‘ Resembling the mouse or its allies ’ to ‘ Resembling a mouse ; ( Zool. ) of or belonging to the subfamily Murinae … ’
When I read the first definition I found myself afterwards musing about who the allies of the mouse were , whether they had previously been enemies , and who it was they were allied against ; after I read the new definition I did not find my imagination tickled in the same way .
There is more than enough scholarship , clarity , and erudition already in the OED ; it can afford to keep a few of these Absurd Entries , if only to provide the occasional belly laugh for future readers .

F - 15 Break - up Animation
This is a computer animation put together by the Accident Investigation Team from Boeing following the crash of an F - 15 Eagle in Missouri last November .
The investigation led to nine other aircraft being discovered with the same fatal flaw in them that brought down this aircraft .
Turned out to be a support beam that was simply milled too thin during manufacturing .
Notice that the cockpit is already starting to wiggle before he is out of the turn .
Also notice the landing gear drop after the break - up .
Turns out that it is controlled by a cable running to the cockpit that gets pulled when the pilot sets the gear down .
As the cockpit was being ripped loose that cable was tugged , resulting in the gear lowering .
I can imagine was a suprise to the investigators on the ground .
“ You said this thing broke up at 15,000 feet right ? ”
“ Yeah , that ’s the word . ”
“ Why the heck would be have his gear down at that height ? ”
The video can be downloaded through this link .
I also am linking here to a second animation of the crash .
This one is a 3D wires mesh graphic that shows the interaction of the aircraft that crashed and his wingman at the time .
Also overlayed with the images is the radio communication from his wingman .
You can here him telling the other two aircraft that were in the air , he refers to them as Mike 1 and Mike 2 to stay away .
The four aircraft were up paired off doing one - on - one dogfighting practice when the breakup occurred .

Imagine the world in 2050 with almost 80 % of the planet ’s population living in urban centers and our fruit , vegetables and even animals are grown in … skyscrapers ?
One man ’s vision has sparked a series of designs leading closer and closer to what will be the first real - life vertical urban farm in Las Vegas , Nevada of all places .
Here are five of these remarkable architectural designs for sustainable ( and stylish ) urban farm towers that may revolutionize agriculture as we know it .
In the long run such structures may not only provide food for hundreds of thousands of people per building but they will also relieve much of the burden on other flat landscapes where fewer and fewer usable growing spaces exist .
One of the first designs of its kind , the compelling vertical farm project above was undertaken by Chris Jacobs in cooperation with the grandfather of skyscraper farm concepts : Dr. Dickson Despommier of Columbia University .
His ideal : all - in - one eco-towers would be actually produce more energy , water ( via condensation / purification ) and food than their occupants would consume .
His mission : to gather architects , engineers , economists and urban planners to develop a sustainable and high - tech wonder of ecological engineering .
Architect Pierre Sartoux of Atelier SOA has gone a step further and put some serious design talent behind his proposal for a vertical farming skyscraper .
A light - shading skin wraps around the structure and opens to admit sunlight at particular locations for various functional ( and aesthetic ) purposes .
The building ’s air , heating and cooling systems are wind - driven and circulate oxygen and carbon dioxide between growing and living spaces .
The simple but reinforced structure is designed to handle additional dead loads from the weight of growing floors and also serve to make the entire building more durable ( and thus sustainable ) .
Given that most urban cores are already densely built , one designer has proposed an auxiliary series of structures to be attached to existing structures in downtown areas .
These modular constructions would provide garden and recreation spaces for residents as well as light and air filters for the adjacent buildings .
In some cases , these retrofits could even provide structural stability to aged buildings and prevent the need to tear them down .
Architecturally , these modular units stand out and add another layer to the visual hierarchy of the cities around them .
The Pacific Northwest regional architecture firm Mithun developed a compelling vertical farm building design to incorporate various green building strategies in a mixed - use residential and commercial complexdesigned for downtown Seattle .
The concept ?
Simply put , the structure is designed as a kind of built organism – completely self - sufficient and adaptive to its surroundings .
The design includes water and energy self - sufficiency from rainwater and gray water collection and reuse , solar cells , vegetable and grain growing spaces and even a chicken farm – all built on a small - footprint downtown urban lot .
Architect Gordon Graff may succeed in the more green and progressive city of Toronto with his plans for a sky farm with 48 floors and millions of square feet of floor space ( and even more growing space ) .
This building , if constructed , will be able to feed tens of thousands of people per year .
Best of all , particularly in Canada , the success of the building ’s crops is n’t contingent upon climactic conditions .
As an architectural and urban design gesture this structure both fits into the city skyline and differentiates itself with simple layers of green .
Depending on your point of view Las Vegas might be the first or it could be the last place you ’d imagine the 30 - story world ’s first vertical farm .
Of course , the food is n’t going to feed the famished masses .
It will instead grace the dinner plates of Vegas tourists at local casinos and hotels .
Still , as a prototype it has a lot of potential to generate further buzz and interest that could in turn lead to future projects .
If the model proves both profitable and sustainable ( always the best combination ) it will likely ( and hopefully ) be the first of many .
And it left the new president with a difficult choice .
If he failed to use his office to criticize Harvard , Mr. Obama would anger black and liberal students ; by speaking out , he would risk dragging himself and the review into the center of shrill debates .
People had a way of hearing what they wanted in Mr. Obama ’s words .
Earlier , after a long , tortured discussion about whether it was better to be called “ black ” or “ African - American , ” Mr. Obama dismissed the question , saying semantics did not matter as much as real - life issues , recalled Cassandra Butts , still a close friend .
According to Mr. Ogletree , students on each side of the debate thought he was endorsing their side .
“ Everyone was nodding , Oh , he agrees with me , ” he said .
As the president of the review , Mr. Obama once again walked a delicate line .
He served on the board of the Black Law Students Association , often speaking passionately about the tempest of the week , but in a way that white classmates say made them feel reassured rather than defensive .
He distanced himself from bombast ; he did a mischievous impersonation of the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he came to speak on campus , recalled Franklin Amanat , now a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn .
Mr. Obama ’s boldest moment came at a rally for faculty diversity , where he compared Professor Bell to Rosa Parks .
But mainly , Mr. Obama stayed away from the extremes of campus debate , often choosing safe topics for his speeches .
At the black law students ’ annual conference , he exhorted students to remember the obligations that came with their privileged education .
His speeches , delivered in the oratorical manner of a Baptist minister , were more memorable for style than substance , Mr. Mack said .
“ It ’s the inspiration of the speech rather than the specific content , ” he said .
Just as he does now that he is a senator , Mr. Obama spoke then about his own biography — initially , Mr. Ogletree said , to correct anyone who assumed he had acquired his position with ease .
His message , Mr. Ogletree said , was , “ Do n’t look at my success and assume that I have had a silver spoon in my mouth and gold coins in my hand . ”
During the constant arguments about race and merit , everyone could point to Mr. Obama and find justification for their views .
He had acknowledged benefiting from affirmative action in the past , so those who supported it saw him as the happy product of their beliefs .
But those who opposed it saw his presidency as the triumph of meritocracy .
He was a black man who had helped one of Harvard ’s most celebrated professors , Laurence H. Tribe , with an article on law and physics , and would graduate magna cum laude .

Much has been made of people who live beyond their means .
When you see a neighbor bring home a fancy new car , you can't help but wonder how she can afford it on her salary .
However , you can't assume you know how much she ( or anybody ) makes unless you 've seen her tax returns .
Searching the heavens for stars , planets or black holes can pay very well .
Plenty of people earn surprising paychecks -- some higher and others lower than you expect .
For this reason we 've put together a list of jobs and their unexpected salaries .
It 's good information to know just to satisfy your curiosity ( or nosiness ) .
Plus , the next time you 're job hunting , use the list as a reminder not to make a snap judgment about any job before you do your research .
Court reporters
What they do : Court reporters transcribe court proceedings , meetings , speeches and other events where verbatim documentation is necessary .
Any time someone says " Strike that from the record , " court reporters are the ones writing that record .
Surprising salary : $ 59,970 * .
You might not have thought typing could earn you so much money , but once you realize court reporters can't miss a word -- often in fast - talking situations -- it makes more sense .
Elementary school principals
What they do : Elementary school principals ensure that students are meeting education requirements by communicating with other administrators , evaluating teachers , monitoring the curriculum and interacting with parents on a regular basis .
Surprising salary : $ 79,310 .
Careers in education , particularly those not at the college level , are notorious for being underpaid .
Principals , however , earn significantly higher salaries than you might expect , sometimes as much as forty percent more than an elementary school teacher .
Paramedics
What they do : Paramedics respond to emergency situations and attempt to provide the necessary medical care , whether it involves transporting participants to a hospital or treating them on the scene .
Surprising salary : $ 27,070 .
Seeing as paramedics have high stress jobs that require them to be on call and ready to save lives at a moment 's notice , you might expect their mean annual salary to be higher .
Astronomers
What they do : Astronomers use their physics and math skills to study the universe and its origin , which includes galaxies , solar systems and the planets within .
They use this research to analyze and solve problems dealing with satellites and space travel .
Surprising salary : $ 95,740 .
Though maybe it should n't be all that surprising considering a doctorate is the standard level of education and there are only 1,700 astronomers in the U.S .
Fashion designers
What they do : Fashion designers design and create new clothes and other fashion accessories to be sold to the public in retail stores .
Depending on whether they work for their own label or for someone else 's , they might set new trends or follow existing ones .
Surprising salary : $ 69,270 .
Aspiring fashion designers are warned that few people can be the next Marc Jacobs , with runway shows at Fashion Week , actresses wearing their dresses at awards shows and millions in the bank -- but the less famous fashion designers , which include those working for retail chains , are earning more than you probably thought .

The importance of face - to - face interaction will never fade away .
There are huge benefits of hosting fringe activities at events .
But due to specific disparities , the concept of hosting events has shifted towards becoming virtual .
So the core competency of organizing a virtual event is similar to an in - person meeting .
There can be various types of virtual events , suiting the needs of the agenda .
Still , the primary goal for all is to organize an engaging meeting filled with networking opportunities and educational and interactive sessions .
The only thing missing is the attendees and site , which will have a digital presence on the webinar platform .
Types of Virtual Meetings :
Often while organizing a virtual event , organizers are perplexed about which types of meetings will be in their best interest .
1. The Standard Virtual Meeting
The standard meeting is an ideal event for mid-sized gatherings or for distributing information to a widely remote audience .
So the standard meeting is mostly informal and provides space for mass interaction .
This meeting type involves a conferencing system wherein an operator works from the back end to ensure the smooth running .
Their function will include managing attendees , sending them to virtual breakouts , muting and unmuting as and when the speaker speaks .
Such kind of an interactive session ensures a two - way communication process and quick deployment of solutions .
Because it is an inexpensive method of remotely gathering attendees .
Live streaming is one of the best types of virtual events that ensures less interaction but high production values .
Such kind of meetings is often organized between presenters and audiences .
So Live - stream meetings can pair with the standard meeting as an add on or become a prelude to a full conference .
While it is ideal for small and mid-sized conference wherein the agenda discussed includes high - profile issues like a product launch , large webinars , etc .
Before broadcasting a live stream in front of a large audience , multiple pieces of content are layered together to create a clean and professional meeting .
So it is the same as that of an in - person meeting except for the digital presence of the audience in the form .
3. The Virtual Conference
A conglomeration of both live - stream meetings and regular visual meeting , the Virtual Conference builds an interactive platform which opens new dimensions for the participants .
Here participants have the liberty to indulge in a one - to - one conversation or group discussions .
So some of the important aspects of video conferencing include registration , ticketing , vendor booths , large breakout rooms , and multiple virtual stages .
This event includes on - demand videos , downloadable media , chat rooms , multiple live streams , etc .
It is one of the best alternatives for a face - to - face meeting while enabling a similar interactive platform for vendors .
Furthermore , it opens a vast scope for attendees to communicate their ideologies with a global audience .
Such meetings are mostly live , while some can have pre-recorded content .
Conclusion
Several factors play a pivotal role in the successful completion of the meetings .
So to ensure that event organizers can send out web links and allows participants .
They can allow them to select customized gifts from Virtual Event Printings , as a token of appreciation .

Japanese actress Koyuki stands next to Panasonic 's new 1080 p resolution Viera 50 - inch plasma televisions ' TH - 50PZ700SK ' during its launch event in Tokyo April 10 , 2007 .
Nearly half of British men surveyed would give up sex for six months in return for a 50 - inch plasma TV , a survey -- perhaps unsurprisingly carried out for a firm selling televisions -- said on Friday .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Nearly half of British men surveyed would give up sex for six months in return for a 50 - inch plasma TV , a survey -- perhaps unsurprisingly carried out for a firm selling televisions -- said on Friday .
Electrical retailer Comet surveyed 2,000 Britons , asking them what they would give up for a large television , one of the latest consumer “ must - haves ” .
The firm found 47 percent of men would give up sex for half a year , compared to just over a third of women .
“ It seems that size really does matter more for men than women , ” the firm said .
A quarter of people said they would give up smoking , with roughly the same proportion willing to give up chocolate .
If history is a reliable guide , the recession of 2008 is now unavoidable .
The dismal jobs report released Friday showed overall employment to be lower than it was three months ago .
Every time such a slump has occurred since the early 1970s , a recession has followed  or already been under way .
And if the good times have really ended , they were never that good to begin with .
Most American households are still not earning as much annually as they did in 1999 , once inflation is taken into account .
Since the Census Bureau began keeping records in the 1960s , a prolonged expansion has never ended without household income having set a new record .
For months , policy makers and Wall Street economists have been predicting , and hoping , that the aggressive series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve would keep the economy growing , despite the housing bust .
But the possibility seemed to diminish almost by the hour on Friday .
Shortly after 8 a.m. , the Fed announced yet another measure meant to unlock the struggling credit markets .
At 8:30 , the Labor Department released the unexpectedly poor jobs report .
Almost immediately , the economists at JPMorgan Chase  who only last week had told clients they thought the economy was still growing  reversed course and said a recession appeared to have started earlier this year .
Einstein gave hope to scientists chasing the most outlandish theories when he famously declared : " If at first , the idea is not absurd , then there is no hope for it . "
He then proved the existence of black holes and the notion that time passes more slowly the faster you travel .
Now one of the world 's most distinguished physicists has scrutinised some of science fiction 's other concepts , such as teleportation and forcefields , and is convinced that they too can become reality .
Professor Michio Kaku , of City University in New York , has ruled out time travel for at least a few millennia , but believes invisibility cloaks and telepathy could be possible this century .
" So many times predictions are made that certain things are impossible only to find them becoming possible a decade or a few decades later , " he said .
In his new book , The Physics of the Impossible , published in the UK today , Kaku rates seemingly impossible phenomena according to how likely they are to happen .
Teleportation
When Gene Roddenberry was planning the early episodes of the cult sci-fi series Star Trek Paramount studios , who financed the project , said the special effects necessary to recreate ships taking off and landing were too expensive .
Roddenberry needed another way to get his characters down onto the surface of the uncharted worlds they were visiting .
" He said , ' we 'll just beam them onto the planet and save a tonne of money ' , " said Kaku .
That money - saving decision did much to cement teleportation as the epitome of the sci- fi way to get around , but teleportation is actually already being done by physicists .
It relies on a deeply strange phenomenon called quantum entanglement , which physicists have already used to " teleport " a photon 89 miles between La Palma and Tenerife in the Canary Island group .
But Kaku concedes that Captain Kirk will have to wait a couple of centuries .
" You are not actually moving the photons from one place to another because you are destroying the original .
What materialises at the other end is your twin which has all the information of the previous object . "
Time Travel
The Cambridge physicist Professor Stephen Hawking spent much of his career attempting to prove that time travel is impossible .
If it were possible , he reasoned , why have we not been visited by voyagers from the future ?
But he was forced to conclude that there is actually nothing in the laws of physics that prevents moving in time .
" He changed his mind about 10 years ago , " said Kaku , " There was no way to ban time travel from happening .
So now he says that time travel is possible , but not practical . "
The way it might work would be to take a trip through a worm hole connecting one point in space and time with another .
The laws of physics suggest that the intense gravity of a black hole is enough to rip the fabric of space and time , making a worm hole possible .
" What we physicists want to do is create our own wormhole so that if you walk through the looking glass you may go backwards in time , " said Kaku .
Stabilising a black hole would require large amounts of an exotic form of energy called negative energy , thought to be impossible .
" But we can now make it in the laboratory , " said Kaku .
Invisibility
One reason why no one has met any time travellers from the future might be , Kaku suggested , because they are able to make themselves invisible .
" Invisibility a la Harry Potter 's cloak is no longer out of the question , " he said .
He rates it as the sci - fi technology that is likely to happen soonest .
Perhaps the most promising new development is the creation of an exotic new substance called a metamaterial .
By eliminating reflections and shadows , it renders an object invisible .
Alien Contact
Scientists currently have the best chance in history of making contact with aliens .
Although humanity has been combing the skies for signs of life for decades , the search so far has been haphazard .
Astronomers have detected around 300 planets in other solar systems , but these are generally large Jupiter - like planets which do not look like a good bet for harbouring life .
Satellites will greatly enhance scientists ' ability to detect Earth - like planets .
" We 've only scanned about a thousand stars and that 's nothing .
We have n't even scanned the stars in our neighbourhood , " said Kaku , " We hope to analyse a thousand times more data than was collected in all the sweeps of the past .
And that 's why we are much more optimistic that we will make contact with alien life . "
He thinks contact with an alien civilisation could happen within decades .
Precognition
Being able to predict the future is very difficult to reconcile with the known laws of physics .
" It would set off a major shake - up in the very foundations of modern physics if precognition was ever proved in reproducible experiments , " said Kaku .
The impossible takes longer : Michio Kaku 's ratings
Type 1 impossibilities
Impossible today , but do not violate the known laws of physics .
Might be possible this century or the next : force fields , invisibility , phasers and death stars , teleportation , telepathy , psychokinesis , robots , UFOs and aliens , starships , antimatter and anti-universes
Type 2 impossibilities
Technologies that sit at the edge of our understanding of the physical world .
May be realised millenia or millions of years in the future : faster - than - light travel , time travel , parallel universes
Type 3 impossibilties
Technologies that violate the known laws of physics .
If they turn out to be possible , they would represent a fundamental shift in our understanding of physics : perpetual motion machines , precognition
MIT researchers have explained why two mutations in the H1N1 avian flu virus were critical for viral transmission in humans during the 1918 pandemic outbreak that killed at least 50 million people .
The team showed that the 1918 influenza strain developed two mutations in a surface molecule called hemagglutinin ( HA ) , which allowed it to bind tightly to receptors in the human upper respiratory tract .
" Two mutations dramatically change the HA binding affinity to receptors found in the human upper airways , " said Ram Sasisekharan , the Underwood Prescott Professor of Biological Engineering and Health Sciences and Technology .
Sasisekharan is the senior author of a paper on the work to be published in the Feb. 18 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
In January , Sasisekharan and colleagues reported in Nature Biotechnology that flu viruses can only bind to human respiratory cells if they match the shape of sugar ( or glycan ) receptors found on those cells .
The glycan receptors found in the human respiratory tract are known as alpha 2 - 6 receptors , and they come in two shapes - one resembling an open umbrella , and another resembling a cone .
To infect humans the MIT team found that avian flu viruses must gain the ability to bind to the umbrella - shaped alpha 2 - 6 receptor .
In the current study , the team discovered that two mutations in HA allow flu viruses to bind tightly or with high affinity to the umbrella - shaped glycan receptors .

" The affinity between the influenza virus HA and the glycan receptors appears to be a critical determinant for viral transmission , " said Sasisekharan .
The researchers used the 1918 influenza virus as a model system to investigate the biochemical basis for hemagglutinin binding to glycans , which leads to viral transmission .
They compared the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic ( known as SC18 ) with a strain called NY18 that differs from SC18 by only one amino acid , and also the AV18 strain , which differs from SC18 by two amino acids .
Using ferrets ( which are susceptible to human flu strains ) , researchers had earlier found that , while SC18 transmitted efficiently between ferrets , NY18 is only slightly infectious and AV18 not at all infectious .
These earlier findings correlate with the viruses ' ability to bind umbrella - shaped alpha 2 - 6 glycan receptors , demonstrated in the current PNAS study .
NY18 , which is only slightly infectious , binds to the umbrella - shaped alpha 2 - 6 receptors but not as well as SC18 , which is highly infectious .
AV18 , which does not infect humans , does not have any affinity for the umbrella - shaped alpha 2 - 6 receptors and binds only to alpha 2 - 3 receptors .
advertisement
Another strain , TX18 , binds to alpha 2 - 6 and alpha 2 - 3 but is much more infectious than NY18 , because it binds with high affinity to the umbrella - shaped alpha 2 - 6 receptors .
Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on the varying infectiousness of these strains last year , but the PNAS study is the first that explains the exact biochemical reason underlying these differences .
This new work could aid researchers in monitoring the HA mutations in the H5N1 avian flu strains currently circulating in Asia .

Research Box Title
NASA 's Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes , with a boost from a natural " zoom lens , " have uncovered what may be one of the youngest and brightest galaxies ever seen in the middle of the cosmic " dark ages , " just 700 million years after the beginning of our universe .
The detailed images from Hubble 's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer ( NICMOS ) reveal an infant galaxy , dubbed A1689 - zD1 , undergoing a firestorm of star birth during the dark ages , a time shortly after the Big Bang but before the first stars reheated the cold , dark universe .
Images from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope 's Infrared Array Camera provided strong additional evidence that it was a young star - forming galaxy in the dark ages .
" We certainly were surprised to find such a bright young galaxy 12.8 billion years in the past , " said astronomer Garth Illingworth of the University of California , Santa Cruz , and a member of the research team .
" This is the most detailed look to date at an object so far back in time . "
" The Hubble images yield insight into the galaxy 's structure that we cannot get with any other telescope , " added astronomer Rychard Bouwens of the University of California , Santa Cruz , one of the co-discoverers of this galaxy .
The new images should offer insights into the formative years of galaxy birth and evolution and yield information on the types of objects that may have contributed to ending the dark ages .
The faraway galaxy also is an ideal target for Hubble 's successor , the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , scheduled to launch in 2013 .
During its lifetime , the Hubble telescope has peered ever farther back in time , viewing galaxies at successively younger stages of evolution .
These snapshots have helped astronomers create a scrapbook of galaxies from infancy to adulthood .
The new Hubble and Spitzer images of A1689 - zD1 show a time when galaxies were in their infancy .
Current theory holds that the dark ages began about 400,000 years after the Big Bang , as matter in the expanding universe cooled and formed clouds of cold hydrogen .
These cold clouds pervaded the universe like a thick fog .
At some point during this era , stars and galaxies started to form .
Their collective light reheated the foggy , cold hydrogen , ending the dark ages about a billion years after the Big Bang .
" This galaxy presumably is one of the many galaxies that helped end the dark ages , " said astronomer Larry Bradley of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Md. , and leader of the study .
" Astronomers are fairly certain that high - energy objects such as quasars did not provide enough energy to end the dark ages of the universe .
But many young star - forming galaxies may have produced enough energy to end it . "
The galaxy is so far away it did not appear in images taken with Hubble 's Advanced Camera for Surveys , because its light is stretched to invisible infrared wavelengths by the universe 's expansion .
It took Hubble 's NICMOS , Spitzer , and a trick of nature called gravitational lensing to see the faraway galaxy .
The astronomers used a relatively nearby massive cluster of galaxies known as Abell 1689 , roughly 2.2 billion light - years away , to magnify the light from the more distant galaxy directly behind it .
This natural telescope is called a gravitational lens .
Though the diffuse light of the faraway object is nearly impossible to see , gravitational lensing has increased its brightness by nearly 10 times , making it bright enough for Hubble and Spitzer to detect .
A telltale sign of the lensing is the smearing of the images of galaxies behind Abell 1689 into arcs by the gravitational warping of space by the intervening galaxy cluster .
The images reveal bright , dense clumps of hundreds of millions of massive stars in a compact region about 2,000 light - years across , which is only a fraction of the width of our Milky Way Galaxy .
This type of galaxy is not uncommon in the early universe , when the bulk of star formation was taking place , Bradley and Illingworth said .
Spitzer 's images show that the galaxy 's mass is typical to that of galaxies in the early universe .
Its mass is equivalent to several billions of stars like our Sun , or just a tiny fraction of the mass of the Milky Way .
" This observation confirms previous Hubble studies that star birth happens in very tiny regions compared with the size of the final galaxy , " Illingworth said .
Even with the increased magnification from the gravitational lens , Hubble 's sharp " eye " can only see knots of the brightest , heftiest stars in the galaxy .
The telescope cannot pinpoint fainter , lower - mass stars , individual stars , or the material surrounding the star - birthing region .
To see those things , astronomers will need the infrared capabilities of NASA 's JWST .
The planned infrared observatory will have a mirror about seven times the area of Hubble 's primary mirror and will collect more light from faint galaxies .
JWST also will be able to view even more remote galaxies whose light has been stretched deep into infrared wavelengths that are out of the reach of NICMOS .
" This galaxy will certainly be one of the first objects that will be observed by JWST , " said team member Holland Ford of Johns Hopkins University .
" This galaxy is so bright that JWST will see its detailed structure .
This object is a pathfinder for JWST for deciphering what is happening in young galaxies . "
The astronomers noted that the faraway galaxy also would be an ideal target for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array ( ALMA ) , which , when completed in 2012 , will be the most powerful radio telescope in the world .
" ALMA and JWST working together would be an ideal combination to really understand this galaxy , " Illingworth said , noting that " JWST 's images and ALMA 's measurement of the gas motions will provide revolutionary insights into the very youngest galaxies . "
The astronomers will conduct follow - up observations with infrared spectroscopy to confirm the galaxy 's distance using the Keck telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii .
The results will be published in the Astrophysical Journal .
Tonight on PBS , part two of the Frontline special " Bush 's War " ( or as I would call it , McCain 's War ) will air .
Part one -- which covered the period from 9/11 to March 2003 -- aired last night was absolutely remarkable in it 's grasp of the entire picture of how and why we are in Iraq .
Although things will certainly evolve from where we find ourselves today , this special will undoubtedly be viewed as the definitive account of the Iraq War .

John McCain 's depressing tour of places where he used to be young has also reminded America of his high - school nickname , " McNasty . "
Even before he was a brain - damaged old psychopath , McCain was a mean , angry creep .
Let 's remember all the times Walnuts went nuts in public , so we can prepare for the inevitable campaign - trail explosion that will end his campaign to be America 's Oldest President .
McCain " often insults people and flies off the handle , " the New York Times reported .
The Arizona Republic was writing about his " volcanic temper " the last time he ran for president , in 1896 1999 .
His former colleague in the Senate , Republican Bob Smith , says McCain is a nutter : " I have witnessed incidents where he has used profanity at colleagues and exploded at colleagues ...
He would disagree about something and then explode .
It was incidents of irrational behavior .
We 've all had incidents where we have gotten angry , but I 've never seen anyone act like that . "
Former Congressman John LeBoutillier , another Republican , says this : " I think he is mentally unstable and not fit to be president . "
Basically everyone on Capitol Hill has been the victim of McCain 's sociopathic tirades , and many have the apology letters from McCain to prove it .
" Nowhere is that sentiment stronger than in the Senate , where McCain has few friends or supporters .
In fact , when McCain ran for the Republican nomination for president in 2000 , only four Republican senators endorsed him , " writes the conservative website NewsMax .
When two Arizona medical doctors met with McCain to discuss a local endangered squirrel , " He slammed his fists on his desk , scattering papers across the room ....
He jumped up and down , screaming obscenities at us for at least 10 minutes .
He shook his fists as if he was going to slug us . "
Says another GOP colleague in the Senate , " I Did n't Want This Guy Anywhere Near A Trigger . "
A furious McCain regularly throws F - bombs at his colleagues for no apparent reason .
In 1995 , at the Capitol , McCain had a " scuffle " with 92 - year - old Republican Senator Strom Thurmond .
That 's right , McCain tried to beat up the one person who was even older than McCain himself .
" It was election night 1986 , and John McCain had just been elected to the U.S. Senate for the first time .
Even so , he was not in a good mood .
McCain was yelling at the top of his lungs and poking the chest of a young Republican volunteer who had set up a lectern that was too tall for the 5 - foot - 9 politician to be seen to advantage , according to a witness to the outburst . "
" The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine , " Republican Senator Thad Cochran said about McCain .
" He is erratic .
He is hotheaded .
He loses his temper and he worries me . "

Wikinews has learned that the Church of Scientology warned the documents - leaking site Wikileaks.org that they are in violation of United States copyright laws after they published several documents related to the Church .
Wikileaks has no intention of complying , and states that in response , it intends to publish a thousand pages of additional Scientology materials beginning Monday .
In the letter to Wikileaks , lawyers for the Church 's Religious Technology Center ( RTC ) , which oversees the use of the their logos , writings and religious content , states that the site " placed RTC 's Advanced Technology works on Wikileaks.org 's website without the authorization " of the Church .
" I have a good faith belief , and in fact know for certain , that posting copies of these works through your system was not authorized by my client , any agent of my client , or the law .
Please be advised that your customer 's action in this regard violates United States copyright law .
Accordingly , we ask for your help in removing these works immediately from your service , " states the letter from Ava Paquette of Moxon & Kobrin , which was published by Wikileaks .
On March 9 , 2008 , Wikileaks published several documents relating to the Church 's Office of Special Affairs and personal notes gathered by Frank Oliver , a former Scientologist and former member of the Church 's Special Affairs office .
On March 26 , 2008 , Wikileaks published the entire set of the Churches ' Operating Thetan Level ' documents which included handwritten notes by Scientology 's founder , L. Ron Hubbard .
Although the letter does not mention specific legal threats , the letter asks that Wikileaks " preserve any and all documents pertaining to this matter and this customer , including , but not limited to , logs , data entry sheets , applications -- electronic or otherwise , registration forms , billings statements or invoices , computer print - outs , disks , hard drives , etc . "
Despite the letter , Wikileaks states it will not comply with the " abusive request " by the Church .
" Wikileaks will not comply with legally abusive requests from Scientology any more than Wikileaks has complied with similar demands from Swiss banks , Russian off - shore stem cell centers , former African Kleptocrats , or the Pentagon .
Wikileaks will remain a place where people of the world may safely expose injustice and corruption , " stated Wikileaks in a release on its website .
Wikileaks further states that , " in response to the attempted suppression , Wikileaks will release several thousand additional pages of Scientology material next week . "

Atomic context and kernel API design

An API should refrain from making promises that it cannot keep .
A recent episode involving the kernel ' smacro demonstrates how things can go wrong when a function does not really do what it appears to do .
It is also a good excuse to look at an under - documented ( but fundamental ) aspect of kernel code design .
Kernel code generally runs in one of two fundamental contexts .
Process context reigns when the kernel is running directly on behalf of a ( usually ) user - space process ; the code which implements system calls is one example .
When the kernel is running in process context , it is allowed to go to sleep if necessary .
But when the kernel is running in atomic context , things like sleeping are not allowed .
Code which handles hardware and software interrupts is one obvious example of atomic context .
There is more to it than that , though : any kernel function moves into atomic context the moment it acquires a spinlock .
Given the way spinlocks are implemented , going to sleep while holding one would be a fatal error ; if some other kernel function tried to acquire the same lock , the system would almost certainly deadlock forever .
" Deadlocking forever " tends not to appear on users ' wishlists for the kernel , so the kernel developers go out of their way to avoid that situation .
To that end , code which is running in atomic context carefully follows a number of rules , including ( 1 ) no access to user space , and , crucially , ( 2 ) no sleeping .
Problems can result , though , when a particular kernel function does not know which context it might be invoked in .
The classic example is kmalloc ( ) and friends , which take an explicit argument ( GFP_KERNEL or GFP_ATOMIC ) specifying whether sleeping is possible or not .
The wish to write code which can work optimally in either context is common , though .
Some developers , while trying to write such code , may well stumble across the following definitions from < linux / hardirq.h > :
/* * Are we doing bottom half or hardware interrupt processing ? *
Are we in a softirq context ?
Interrupt context ? */ # define in_irq ( ) ( hardirq_count ( ) ) # define in_softirq ( ) ( softirq_count ( ) ) # define in_interrupt ( ) ( irq_count ( ) ) # define in_atomic ( ) ( ( preempt_count ( ) & ~ PREEMPT_ACTIVE ) != 0 )
It would seem that in_atomic ( ) would fit the bill for any developer trying to decide whether a given bit of code needs to act in an atomic manner at any specific time .
A quick grep through the kernel sources shows that , in fact , in_atomic ( ) has been used in quite a few different places for just that purpose .
There is only one problem : those uses are almost certainly all wrong .
The in_atomic ( ) macro works by checking whether preemption is disabled , which seems like the right thing to do .
Handlers for events like hardware interrupts will disable preemption , but so will the acquisition of a spinlock .
So this test appears to catch all of the cases where sleeping would be a bad idea .
Certainly a number of people who have looked at this macro have come to that conclusion .
But if preemption has not been configured into the kernel in the first place , the kernel does not raise the " preemption count " when spinlocks are acquired .
So , in this situation ( which is common - many distributors still do not enable preemption in their kernels ) , in_atomic ( ) has no way to know if the calling code holds any spinlocks or not .
So it will return zero ( indicating process context ) even when spinlocks are held .
And that could lead to kernel code thinking that it is running in process context ( and acting accordingly ) when , in fact , it is not .
Given this problem , one might well wonder why the function exists in the first place , why people are using it , and what developers can really do to get a handle on whether they can sleep or not .
Andrew Morton answered the first question in a relatively cryptic way :
in_atomic( ) is for core kernel use only .
Because in special circumstances ( ie : kmap_atomic ( ) ) we run inc_preempt_count ( ) even on non-preemptible kernels to tell the per-arch fault handler that it was invoked by copy_*_user ( ) inside kmap_atomic ( ) , and it must fail .
In other words , in_atomic ( ) works in a specific low - level situation , but it was never meant to be used in a wider context .
Its placement in hardirq.h next to macros which can be used elsewhere was , thus , almost certainly a mistake .
As Alan Stern pointed out , the fact that Linux Device Drivers recommends the use of in_atomic ( ) will not have helped the situation .
Your editor recommends that the authors of that book be immediately sacked .
Once these mistakes are cleared up , there is still the question of just how kernel code should decide whether it is running in an atomic context or not .
The real answer is that it just can't do that .
Quoting Andrew Morton again :
The consistent pattern we use in the kernel is that callers keep track of whether they are running in a schedulable context and , if necessary , they will inform callees about that .
Callees do n't work it out for themselves .
This pattern is consistent through the kernel - once again , the GFP_ flags example stands out in this regard .
But it 's also clear that this practice has not been documented to the point that kernel developers understand that things should be done this way .
Consider this recent posting from Rusty Russell , who understands these issues better than most :
This flag indicates what the allocator should do when no memory is immediately available : should it wait ( sleep ) while memory is freed or swapped out ( GFP_KERNEL ) , or should it return NULL immediately ( GFP_ATOMIC ) .
And this flag is entirely redundant : kmalloc ( ) itself can figure out whether it is able to sleep or not .
In fact , kmalloc ( ) cannot figure out on its own whether sleeping is allowable or not .
It has to be told by the caller .
This rule is unlikely to change , so expect a series of in_atomic ( ) removal patches starting with 2.6.26 .
Once that work is done , the in_atomic ( ) macro can be moved to a safer place where it will not create further confusion .

As part of my new and probably futile resolution to raise the
tone of these forums and keep them civil and on point , I plan to delete the sort of general , personal snark and gratuitous rhetorical poison that inevitably infects these conversations .
If you 're bored by the topic or do n't like the idea ( or me ) in general , find somewhere else to vent .
— Former Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong was held in criminal contempt of court Friday for lying to a judge when pursuing rape charges against three falsely accused Duke University lacrosse players last year .
Superior Court Judge W. Osmond Smith III sentenced Nifong , who has already been disbarred and has resigned from office , to a single day in jail .
He faced as many as 30 days in jail and a fine up to $ 500 .
" If what I impose , with regard to Mr. Nifong , would make things better or different for what 's already happened , I do n't know what it would be or how I could do it , " Smith said .
Reading his contempt decision from the bench minutes after the conclusion of two days of testimony , Smith said Nifong " willfully made false statements " to the court in September when he insisted he had given defense attorneys all results from a critical DNA test .
Smith found Nifong had provided the defense with a report on the DNA testing that he knew was incomplete .
The excluded data contained test results showing that DNA of multiple men , none of whom were lacrosse players , was found on the accuser .
Smith said his decision was aimed at " protecting and preserving the integrity of the court and its processes . "
" It 's about the candor , accuracy and truthfulness in representations to the court , particularly in important matters where the liberties and rights to a fair trial of those accused of crime may be jeopardized by the absence of such honesty by counsel , " Smith said .
Taking the stand in his own defense , Nifong insisted Friday he did n't intentionally lie about whether he had turned over the DNA evidence .
But he acknowledged the report he gave defense attorneys was incomplete .
" I now understand that some things that I thought were in the report were in fact not in the report , " Nifong said .
" So the statements were not factually true to the extent that I said all the information had been provided . "
Defense attorney Brad Bannon , who represented David Evans , found the excluded data amid 1,844 pages of documents Nifong gave the defense six months after the initial report .
Nifong said that by the time he realized the data was n't contained in that report , " it had been corrected .
The defendants already had it . "
" It was never my intention to mislead this or any other court , " Nifong said .
" I certainly apologize to the court at this time for anything I might have said that was not correct . "
Defense attorney Jim Glover declined to comment after the hearing .
" It 's not a happy day for us , but we 're thrilled the system works , that justice has happened , and we 're moving on , " said Kevin Finnerty , whose son , Collin Finnerty , was falsely prosecuted by Nifong .
Joseph Cheshire , another attorney for Evans , said he felt sorry for Nifong 's family , but not Nifong .
" I think what he did was willful and intentional and damaged seriously this state and the lives of these boys and their families , " he said .
" I do n't feel sorry for Mike Nifong .
Sorry if that sounds cruel , but I do n't . "
Earlier Friday , Brian Meehan , the director of a private lab who prepared the DNA testing report , said the omissions were a misunderstanding .
He said Nifong asked him to test DNA samples from lacrosse players to see if any matched genetic material found on the woman who told police she was raped .
Although male DNA was found , no sample matched a lacrosse player .
Results from the other unidentified men was referenced as " non-probative " material in the report given to defense attorneys , Meehan said .
Charles Davis , the attorney appointed to prosecute the contempt charge , asked Meehan whether Nifong 's statement to the court - that the report encompassed everything he had discussed with Meehan - was true or false .
" It would be false because we do n't include discussions in our reports , " Meehan answered .
On Thursday , Meehan said he was the one who decided how to prepare the report stating no lacrosse player had been linked to the accuser .
When Glover asked Meehan if Nifong had asked him to leave anything out of the report , Meehan answered , " No . "
When Nifong reports to jail at 9 a.m. next Friday , it will bring an end to the criminal case that began when exotic dancer Crystal Mangum told police she was raped at a March 2006 party thrown by the co-captains of Duke 's 2006 lacrosse team .
Nifong went on to win indictments against three players – Evans , Finnerty and Reade Seligmann .
The troubled case took a turn in December when Nifong dropped rape charges against Evans , Finnerty and Seligmann after Mangum said she was n’t 100 percent sure she was raped .
In January , Nifong recused himself from the case amid charges he had violated ethics rules , and in April , state Attorney General Roy Cooper dismissed the remaining charges and declared the three defendants innocent victims of a “ tragic rush to accuse . ”
Nifong was disbarred in June for more than two dozen violations of the state 's rules of professional conduct during his prosecution of the lacrosse case .
He resigned as district attorney a month later .
Nifong now faces the possibility of civil lawsuits from the falsely accused players .
And 3rd District Rep. Walter B. Jones has called a number of times for a federal investigation into Nifong 's handling of the case .
“ It was a tragedy for the system that everything so badly misfired , and frankly , it was a tragedy for Mike Nifong , ” said James Cooney , Seligmann ’s attorney .
Naval warships are all - powerful vessels but they are also easy to spot .
Concerns about being detected have led the military to develop new stealth technologies that allow ships to be virtually invisible to the human eye , to dodge roaming radars , put heat - seeking missiles off the scent , disguise their own sound vibrations and even reduce the way they distort the Earth ’s magnetic field , as senior lecture in remote sensing and sensors technology at Britannia Royal Navy College , Chris Lavers , explains in March ’s Physics World .
Wars throughout the twentieth century prompted advances in stealth technologies .
Some of the earliest but most significant strides towards invisibility involved covering ships with flamboyant cubist patterns – a technique known as “ dazzle painting ” .
During the Second World War , the US military even worked out a way of using lights to make the brightness of a ship match that of the background sea .
Can you see this battleship ?
Exactly .
When British physicist Robert Watson
Watt was charged with designing a ‘ death ray ’ to destroy entire towns and cities during the Second World War , he calculated it impossible .
He did conclude however that radio waves could be used to detect ships and aircrafts too far way to be seen by the naked eye .
Radar was born .
For ships to dodge radar , both a ship ’s geometry and a ship ’s coating have to be considered .
Radars are particularly receptive to right angles , which is why modern battleships are often peculiarly shaped .
Special paint and foam - coating have also been used to cover ships , which convert radio - waves into heat and stop radio waves being reflected , rendering the signals useless .
Early efforts .
' Dazzle ' painting .
The “ stealthiest ” ship that currently exists is Sweden ’s Visby Corvette .
Apart from being painted in grey dazzle camouflage and made of low - radar reflectivity materials , it also does not use propellers , which are the noisiest part of a ship .
The vessel also has the lowest “ magnetic signature ” of any current warship .
But the next generation of warships could be truly invisible by exploiting “ metamaterials ” – artificially engineered structures first dreamt up by physicist John Pendry at Imperial College , London .
Metamaterials are tailored to have specific electromagnetic properties not found in nature .
In particular , they can bend light around an object , making it appear to an observer as though the waves have passed through empty space .

Abstract
This essay explores the impact of racial discrimination on the imposition of collateral consequences on those convicted of crime .
The category of serious crime which is intrinsically most subject to discretionary enforcement is drug law violations ; the number of violators far exceeds the criminal justice resources available to investigate , prosecute and punish them .
Accordingly , a high level of selectivity is inevitable .
At the same time , the best evidence for racially discriminatory prosecution is in the area of drug violations ; while most drug offenders are white , most people imprisoned for drug violations are not .
African Americans are imprisoned for drug offenses at rates that far exceed their representation in the general population , in the population of drug offenders , in the population of those arrested for drug crimes , and in the population of those convicted of drug crimes .
The essay also notes that of all categories of crime , drug convictions have been freighted with the most severe collateral consequences .
Under statutes which do not apply to convicted rapists , murderers or terrorists , drug offenders may lose student loans and other educational benefits , their drivers ' licenses , access to public housing , food stamps and other benefit providing necessities of life .
These collateral consequences are so numerous and burdensome that they may interfere with former prisoners ' ability to reenter society and support themselves without reoffending .
Unfortunately , the legislative history of the development of collateral consequences such as disenfranchisement , like the development of the drug laws themselves , suggests that the laws were enacted with racial minorities in mind .
The essay concludes by proposing that jurisdictions reexamine the way in which collateral consequences are imposed .

Russia 's Vladimir Putin ( l ) cemented ties with Iran in an October visit
The two sides reached agreement last week on a schedule to finish building the plant after years of delays .
The UN has demanded that Iran halt uranium enrichment but has approved the Russian nuclear fuel deliveries .
US President George W Bush supported the move , but said it proved " the Iranians do not need to learn how to enrich " uranium for themselves .
Some Western countries fear Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons but Tehran says its programme is for peaceful power generation only .
' Threat to peace '
The Russian company building the Bushehr plant , Atomstroiexport , said the delivery of the enriched uranium fuel began on Sunday .
The head of Iran 's atomic energy agency , Gholam Reza Aghazadeh , later confirmed that the first delivery had arrived , according to Iran 's state - run Irna news agency .
BUSHEHR NUCLEAR PLANT
Begun in 1974 with German assistance Work halts after Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution Resumed in 1992 with Russian help 13 Dec : Russia and Iran agree to finish plant after numerous delays
Two pressurised water reactors
One believed near completion , could begin operating in eight months Cost : $ 1b n
Russia ignores
West 's fears
The nuclear fuel cycle
Enriched uranium is used as fuel in nuclear power stations .
When it is more highly enriched , it can be used to make nuclear weapons .
President Bush said on Monday : " If the Iranians accept that uranium for a civilian nuclear power plant , then there 's no need for them to learn how to enrich .
" Iran was a threat to peace , Iran is a threat to peace and Iran will be a threat to peace if we do n't stop their enrichment facilities . "
There are two pressurised water reactors at the Bushehr site , one of which is reportedly near completion and likely to be the first major Iranian reactor to begin generating electricity , possibly by mid-2008 .
Russian officials have previously said the plant could be operational within six months of fuel being delivered .
Iran first planned a reactor near the south - western port of Bushehr with German assistance in 1974 .
Those plans were abandoned after the Islamist revolution in 1979 but the Russians picked up the project in 1992 .
On 13 December , Russia and Iran agreed on a schedule to finish construction on the Bushehr plant after repeated delays .
Russia had said Iran was behind on payments .
But many analysts believe Moscow delayed over Tehran 's resistance to international pressure to be more open about its nuclear programme .
Enrichment row
The United States has been leading a drive in the UN Security Council to pass a third round of sanctions against Iran .
Russia and China have co-operated with the previous two votes but a US intelligence report two weeks ago said Iran had stopped trying to develop nuclear weapons in 2003 , taking some of the steam out of the American pressure .
The latest report on Iran from the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , concluded that Tehran was being more open about some aspects of its programme , but there remained unanswered questions and uranium enrichment had not been halted despite the UN 's demands .
The delivery of the nuclear fuel has removed one of the most significant practical sanctions against Tehran , says the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent , Jonathan Marcus .
Russia is helping Iran build and fuel the Bushehr plant
Atomstroiexport said the containers of fuel had been inspected and sealed before delivery by the UN 's nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
The company said the first delivery of 163 canisters of uranium - 235 arrived at Bushehr on Sunday .
The full delivery will take up to two months , Atomstroiexport said .
The fuel is lowly - enriched uranium which Russia says cannot be used in a nuclear weapon .
It said it had received assurances from Tehran that the fuel would not be used anywhere but Bushehr .
Russia urged Iran to stop enriching uranium , saying there was no longer any need .
But a senior Iranian official said his country would not halt uranium enrichment under any circumstances , Reuters news agency said .
The terrible Canadian ISP Rogers has reached a new low .
Now , in addition to arbitrarily enforcing limits on connectivity and " traffic shaping " its customers ' connections into unusability ( just try to have a VoIP call with a Rogers subscriber ! ) , they 're breaking into your web - browsing sessions and rewriting the pages you view to deliver stern warnings saying that you 're using too much bandwidth .
The ISP will let you opt out — but this is so obnoxious , it 's hard to believe they 're even trying it .

Fidel Castro has not been seen in public since his operation in July
Castro's career
The 81 - year - old handed over power temporarily to his brother Raul in July 2006 when he underwent surgery and has not been seen in public since then .
Cuba 's new parliament will meet on Sunday to elect a new president .
Washington has called for Cuba to hold free elections , and said its decades - long embargo would remain .
This should be a period of democratic transition for the people of Cuba
US President George W Bush
Reaction in quotes Cold War to thaw ?
Send us your reaction
President George W Bush said the US was ready to help the " people of Cuba realise the blessings of liberty " .
A senior US state department official , John Negroponte , added that the 1962 embargo would probably not be lifted " any time soon " .
The European Union said it hoped to relaunch ties with Cuba that were almost completely frozen under Mr Castro , while China described Mr Castro as an old friend and said it would maintain co-operation with Cuba .
Mr Castro has ruled Cuba since leading a revolution in 1959 .
The BBC's Michael Voss reports from Havana that most Cubans will be saddened by news of their leader 's retirement , but many hope the political transition will bring economic improvements .
Soldiering on
Mr Castro made his announcement in a letter published on the website of the Cuban Communist Party 's newspaper Granma in the middle of the night , Cuban time .
He said he would not accept another five - year term as president when the National Assembly met on Sunday .
" It would betray my conscience to take up a responsibility that requires mobility and total devotion , that I am not in a physical condition to offer , " he wrote .
Mr Castro said he had not stepped down after undergoing emergency intestinal surgery in 2006 because he had had a duty to the Cuban people to prepare them for his absence .
But retirement , he added , would not stop him from carrying " on fighting like a soldier of ideas " , and he promised to continue writing essays entitled Reflections of Comrade Fidel .
" I will be one more weapon in the arsenal that you can count on , " he said .
Search for new leader
The National Assembly is widely expected to elect Raul Castro , 76 , as Fidel 's successor .
FIDEL CASTRO
Born in 1926 to a wealthy , landowning family Took up arms in 1953 , six years before coming to power Brother Raul was deputy and Che Guevara third in command Has outlasted nine American presidents Target of many CIA assassination plots Daughter is a dissident exile in Miami
Castro 's life in pictures
He has mooted major economic reforms and " structural changes " .
But some analysts see a possible generational jump , with Vice - President Carlos Lage Davila , 56 , a leading contender .
Anyone hoping that Fidel Castro 's departure from the political scene would bring about the end of the communist regime was disappointed , the BBC's Nick Miles reports .
Whilst Cuban exiles celebrated in Miami , Florida , there were no protests on the streets of Havana calling for political change .
In part , our reporter says , this is because the regime does not tolerate dissent - but it is also because many in Cuba are wary of what change will probably mean : a mass influx of exiles returning from Miami .
Raul Castro has worked to ensure a smooth political transition , keeping the army loyal to the regime and strengthening the Communist Party 's hold by introducing reforms and weeding out corrupt officials .
He has also had the advantage of continued economic support from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in the form of millions of barrels of cheap oil , our reporter adds .
Mixed legacy
It is not clear whether Mr Castro 's retirement was prompted by a further decline in his health - the state of which is an official secret .
Though Fidel Castro has not been seen in public for 19 months , the government occasionally releases photographs and pre-edited video of him meeting visiting leaders from around the world .
The retiring leader will be remembered as one of the most distinctive and enduring icons from the second half of the 20th Century , the BBC's Paul Keller writes .
With his olive green fatigues , beard and Cuban cigars , Fidel Castro was the original Cold Warrior .
Under his leadership Cuba established the first Marxist - Leninist state in the Western hemisphere , almost within sight of the US coastline .
Embracing communism and the patronage of the Soviet Union , Fidel Castro transformed Cuba economically and socially but had to struggle when it collapsed .
He leaves his country with universal free healthcare and a much - admired education system , which has produced doctors for the developing world , but also a failing economy .

Martial Law
The Progressive printed an article by Matthew Rothschild , " The FBI Deputizes Businesses " , 02/07/08 .
This is a very long excellent article delineating how the FBI and Homeland Security have formed a group called InfraGard within businesses that cooperate with the two agencies for an exchange of information , often of a sensitive nature .
In fact , within the article it is stated that InfraGard on occasion receives information regarding security threats even before elected officials .
Further , it is mentioned several times that members of InfraGard have the right to " shoot to kill " without fear of prosecution for the protection of their facilities .
Although this organization , InfraGard , is frightening enough , there is a small paragraph that mentions that at one meeting of InfraGard the members were given detailed information as to what their responsibilities would be when martial law is declared .
The whistle blower had this information corroborated by another individual , and a third would not deny it .
The important point is , however , the statement reads not if – but " when . "
There have been so many excellent articles submitted to OpEdNews regarding George Bush 's Signing Statements , Executive Orders , and laws submitted to and passed by Congress , but I want to remind readers of just a few of these actions by this dangerous administration .
Although the Plan for a New American Century ( PNAC ) was written prior to Bush II being elected , his family was involved in the formation of it .
Within that Plan was the statement , and I paraphrase , that the Plan would be difficult to implement without another " Pearl Harbor " .
Or another attack on the United States of commensurate devastation .
When the Bush II cabal was told , over and over , about an imminent attack on the United States , these admonitions were ignored completely .
And we experienced 9/11 .
The night of 9/11 , long before any facts were known by anyone , Wolf Blitzer announced on CNN that we had been attacked by Iraq !
One month after 9/11 , Congress passed the Patriot Act .
This was the first of many steps in the erosion of our civil liberties under the guise of ' protecting us from terrorism ' , which then became the mantra of this administration .
Terrorism , terrorism , terrorism .
Based on lies , more lies and damned lies , the United States invaded Afghanistan , and then Iraq .
It was beyond my comprehension that anyone alive believed George W. Bush and his claims that we needed to invade Iraq for security reasons .
All one had to do was look at his face when he was telling all of those lies – he smirked !
On 1/3/06 , Congress passed the Military Commissions Act , which not only confirmed the suspension of habeas corpus for ' terrorists ' , but laid out the process by which martial law would be implemented – regardless of the process defined in the US Constitution .
In October of 2006 , the John Warner National Authorization Act was passed .
Inserted in that Act was Section 1042 :
" Revises federal provisions allowing the President to utilize the Armed Forces in connection with interference with federal and state law to allow the President to employ the Armed Forces and National Guard in federal service to restore public order in cases of natural disaster , epidemic or other public health emergency , terrorist attack or incident , or domestic violence .
Requires the President to notify Congress within 14 days of the exercise of such authority .
Authorizes the President , when exercising such authority , to direct the Secretary to provide supplies , services , and equipment to persons affected by the situation . "
There went the Posse Comitatus Act which has prevented the Presidents from using the Armed Forces as police .
Now we have Blackwater acting in place of our armed forces , and apparently responsible to no one .
Would Blackwater be the armed forces used ?
Now there is an unhappy thought .
During this time , there were a number of Executive Orders , numbered from 10900 – 11921 that detailed even more carefully how easily martial law can be declared .
Consider the state of our economy now .
One of the provisions for declaring martial law is an economic crisis .
Bernanke fiddled with the interest rates while the economy sank – why ?
Incompetence ?
Intentional ?
Forcing an economic crisis ?
The final insult is SB 1959 .
By itself it is innocuous – but put together with the Patriot Act , Military Commissions Act , the Executive Orders and the Signing Statements they form a pattern that is extremely hard to miss if people would just read them !
Under SB 1959 any action that the Administration feels undercuts their intentions , can be classified as a ' violent radicalization ' action .
Included is a provision that people cannot even think these things .
Therefore , opposition to the current Federal Budget that increases military spending but cuts funding to all programs to help ordinary citizens would be classed as a ' violent radicalization ' action .
We are undercutting this Administration 's efforts to fight ' terrorism ' .
Thus , those of us who are committed to the basic ethical principles which are the basis of all the respected philosophies and religions of the world would be considered radical and therefore questionable .
Do not love your neighbor as yourself – he / she might be a Muslim ; do not love God more than your President – God may have admonished you to act differently than your President desires , like feeding the hungry , clothing the naked , housing the homeless and giving aid and comfort to those who need it .
Something for which I have no documentation , but which has sort of tickled around in my brain for the last year or so , is why Bush II was not at all disturbed by the turnover in Congress in '06 .
I understand all of the arguments that the Democrats in Congress have rolled over for him so he need not worry .
And to a certain extent , that is true .
But one other picture I can't get out of mind is that of Dick Cheney smiling during this year 's State of the Union speech when Bush was blithering on about something .
Cheney did n't need to worry about the blithering .

Top Bush Administration officials pressured underlings to use torture tactics at Guantanamo
Of Guantanamo interrogators : “ You could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas . ”
“ Torture at GuantÃ¡namo was sanctioned by the most senior advisers to the president , the vice president , and the secretary of defense , according to the international lawyer and professor of law at University College London Philippe Sands , who has conducted a forensic examination of the chain of command leading from the top of the administration to the camp at GuantÃ¡namo , ” Vanity Fair will report on newstands today .
The article directly contradicts the administration ’s account to Congress , which placed responsibility on military commanders and interrogators on the ground for the practices banned by the Geneva Conventions .
Excerpts from the magazine ’s release follow .
The full story is available here .
Sands reports that these senior advisers face a real risk of criminal investigation if they set foot outside the United States , despite the Military Commissions Act , signed into law by President Bush in 2006 .
The hitch is that their immunity is good only within U.S. borders , and rather than protecting them , the act may lead to an eventual investigation by foreign governments .
For some , the future may hold “ a tap on the shoulder . ” 
Sands consulted a judge and prosecutor in a major European city , both of whom are familiar with these sorts of cases .
The prosecutor called the act “ very stupid , ”  explaining that it would make it much easier for investigators outside the U.S. to argue that possible war crimes would never be addressed in their home country .
“ It ’s a matter of time , ”  the judge told Sands .
“ And then something unexpected happens , when one of these lawyers travels to the wrong place . ” 
Sands talks with everyone from high level members of the administration to soldiers on the ground at GuantÃ¡namo , among them : Douglas Feith , former undersecretary of defense , General Richard Myers , former joint chiefs chairman , and Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver , who was charged with writing a document providing legal authority for harsh interrogation .
Also in Sands ’s article :
DOUGLAS FEITH ON HOW THE ADMINISTRATION EVADED THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS :
Feith confirms that the logic of the law was not followed with respect to Geneva , rather it deliberately created a legal black hole into which the detainees were meant to fall ” ” and that was the point .
“ Did n’t the administration ’s approach mean that Geneva ’s constraints on interrogation could n’t be invoked by anyone at GuantÃ¡namo ? ” 
Sands asked Feith .
“ Oh yes , sure , ”  Feith replied .
“ Was that the intended result ? ”  “ Absolutely . ” 
Sands writes that he asked again : Under the Geneva Conventions , no one at GuantÃ¡namo was entitled to any protection ?
“ That ’s the point , ”  Feith reiterated .
As he saw it , either you were a detainee to whom Geneva did n’t apply ( al - Qaeda fighters , because they were n’t part of a state ) ; or you were a detainee to whom Geneva applied but whose rights you could n’t invoke ( members of the Taliban , because they had n’t worn uniforms or insignia ) .
What was the difference for the purpose on interrogation ?
Sands asked .
Feith answered with a certain satisfaction : “ It turns out , none .
But that ’s the point . ” 
When Sands asks Feith whether he was at all concerned that the Geneva decision might have diminished America ’s moral authority , Feith tells Sands , “ The problem with moral authority ”  was “ people who should know better , like yourself , siding with the assholes , to put it crudely . ” 
According to Sands , Feith ’s arguments were so clever that General Richard Myers , joint chiefs chairman , continued to believe that Geneva ’s protection remained in force , and was “ well and truly hoodwinked , ”  a seasoned observer of military affairs tells Sands .
MEETING OF HIGH -LEVEL ADMINISTRATION LAWYERS ON SEPTEMBER 25 AT GUANTÃ NAMO TO DISCUSS TACTICS :
A delegation of the administration ’s senior lawyers , including Dick Cheney ’s chief counsel ( later his chief of staff ) David S. Addington , White House counsel ( later attorney general ) Alberto Gonzales , Pentagon general counsel Jim Haynes , and the C.I.A. ’s John Rizzo arrived at Gitmo on September 25 .
“ They wanted to know what we were doing to get this guy [ Mohammed al - Qahtani , allegedly a member of the 9/11 conspiracy and the so - called 20th hijacker ] , ”  Major General Michael Dunlavey , who ran Joint Task Force 170 , which oversaw military interrogations , tells Sands , “ and Addington was interested in how we were managing it . ” ¦
They brought ideas with them which had been given from sources in D.C.
They came down to observe and talk . ” 
Throughout this period , says Dunlavey , Rumsfeld was “ directly and regularly involved . ” 
LT .
COLONEL DIANE BEAVER ON WASHINGTON’S ROLE IN DEVISING TACTICS , AND JACK BAUER’S INFLUENCE :
Sands reports that Beaver , who was charged with writing a document providing legal authority for harsh interrogation , confirms new details of the crucial meeting that took place at GuantÃ¡namo , and she tells Sands she “ kept minutes ”  at other brainstorming sessions in which new techniques were discussed .
The younger men would get particularly excited , she says : “ You could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas . ” 
Beaver also notes that ideas arose from other sources , such as the television show 24 .
Jack Bauer , the main character , had many friends at GuantÃ¡namo , says Beaver : “ He gave people lots of ideas . ” 
It was clear to Sands that Beaver believed that Washington was directly involved in the interrogations , and her account confirms what others tell Sands ” ” that Washington ’s views were being fed into the process by people physically present at GuantÃ¡namo .
BEAVER ON HER ROLE AT GUANTÃNAMO :
Sands reports that Beaver was set up as a fall guy of sorts .
Someone more fully schooled in the relevant law might have questioned what she was being asked to do .
“ It was not my job to second - guess the president , ”  Beaver tells Sands .
Despite other memos prepared by administration lawyers , none other was cited as bearing on aggressive interrogations .
Beaver tells
Sands she was insistent that the decision to implement new techniques be properly written up , and that the paper trail to the top be clear .
“ I wanted to get something in writing , ”  she tells Sands .
“ That was my game plan .
I had four days .
Dunlavey gave me just four days . ” 
Beaver tells
Sands that she never imagined her work would not be vetted by someone higher up the chain .
What she did n’t know at the time , according to Sands , was that those same people had already made their decisions , had the security of legal cover from the Justice Department , and , although confident with that protection , had no intention of soiling their hands by weighing in on the unpleasant details of interrogation .
GENERAL RICHARD MYERS AND A FORMER PENTAGON OFFICIAL ON HOW THE HAYNES MEMO DID NOT GO THROUGH THE USUAL CHANNELS OF APPROVAL :
Myers confessed to Sands that he was troubled that normal procedures had been circumvented with regard to the Haynes Memo [ An “ action memo ”  written in November 2002 listing proposed techniques of aggressive interrogation ] .
“ You do n’t see my initials on this , ”  he tells Sands , as he holds the paper .
“ You see I ’ve just “ ˜discussed ’ it , ”  he says , noting a sentence in the memo to that effect .
“ This was not the way this should have come about . ” 
He tells Sands of the “ intrigue ”  that was going on around the time of the memo , “ that I was n’t aware of , ”  he says , “ that was probably occurring between Jim Haynes , White House general counsel , and Justice . ” 
A former Pentagon official provides further confirmation that the memo got special handling , telling Sands that Lieutenant General Bantz Craddock , Rumsfeld ’s senior military assistant , noticed the memo was missing a buck slip , an essential component that shows a document ’s circulation path , and which everyone was supposed to initial .
There was no signature from the general counsel ’s office , so it went back to Haynes who signed off with a note that said simply , “ Good to go . ” 
Philippe Sands is an international lawyer at Matrix Chambers and a professor at University College London .
This is his first article for Vanity Fair , and is based on several years of reporting .
Sands is the author of numerous books ” ” a full account of this article will appear in Torture Team : Rumsfeld ’s Memo and the Betrayal of American Values ( Palgrave Macmillan ) , out in May 2008 .
The May issue of Vanity Fair hits newsstands in New York and Los Angeles on April 2 and nationally on April 8 .
The Chinese Government is doing itself no favours with its
censorship and denial over Tibet .
Foreign media has been accused of bias against China in reporting the protests that began in Lhasa on March 10 and degenerated into a violent riot on March 14 that saw large swathes of the Tibetan capital burnt and at least 22 dead , including a group of five women - four Han Chinese and one Tibetan - burnt to death in the clothes shop in which they worked .
I do n't believe that any of the foreign media - or Tibetans - condone mob violence , but the relentless propaganda campaign by the Chinese authorities to present a version of events that acknowledges not one death of a protester since March 10 - while systematically refusing to allow journalists or other observers into Tibetan areas to investigate - is breathtaking in its hypocrisy and counterproductive .
We are here to try and understand each other but prevented from hearing the other side , one proceeds with extreme caution .

He became a billionaire by tunnelling through the ruins of the Soviet economy .
Now Roman Abramovich has bought the world 's biggest drill .
Chelsea Football Club's Russian owner has forked out £ 80 million on the boring - machine , which will have a 63ft diameter , almost a quarter wider than its nearest rival .
The acquisition was announced in Moscow yesterday by Mr Abramovich 's construction firm Infrastruktura .
Few details were given but there was immediate speculation that the drill would be used to build a tunnel linking Russia and America under the 55 - mile wide Bering Strait .
The tycoon is thought to share outgoing Russian President Vladimir Putin 's vision of a " WorldLink " tunnel connecting the frozen wastes of Chukotka , the Russian region of which Mr Abramovich is governor , to Alaska .
" It is one of Putin 's dream projects and he has already had secret talks with Washington about it , " claimed an insider .
" He sees Russia as the hub of the world and wants Europe to transport its goods , as well as his own , across his country to the U.S. "
Scroll down for more ...
The drill , which will take German firm Herrenknecht AG two years to build , would create the world 's longest undersea tunnel and reunite the land masses of Russia and America for the first time since the last Ice Age .
Such a tunnel was first mooted a century ago under Tsar Nicholas II but foundered with the advent of the Russian Revolution .
The idea was revived after the Soviet Union 's collapse but was shelved in Russia 's financial meltdown of 1998 .
Officials insist a tunnel could be ready within ten years , and would repay construction costs by stimulating up to 100 million tons of freight traffic each year , as well as supplying oil , gas and electricity from Siberia to the U.S. and Canada .
Mr Abramovich 's spokesman John Mann denied the order of the giant drill was related to any plans for a tunnel in Chukotka .
However , the tycoon denied any plans to separate from his wife Irina in October 2006 - five months before announcing his divorce .
U.S. authorities said they had not received any definite plans for a tunnel to be built under the Bering Strait and would not comment on whether there had been any direct approach from Mr Putin .
The boring machine which currently holds the record as the world 's biggest has a 50ft diameter and was bought by China to build a tunnel under the Yangtze .
The tunnels bored beneath the Channel to link the UK with France were created by machines with diameters of 25ft .
What if all the Poles went home ?
By Simon Cox
The Investigation , Radio 4
This might not get built , for a start Builders .
Nannies .
Engineers .
Fruit pickers .
Hard working Poles have been earning pounds and providing extra labour since 2004 .
What if they all decide to leave ?
How would Britain cope if the Poles went home ?
It may seem unlikely but companies across the country are reporting that the Polish influx is coming to an end .
Danny Sriskandarajah , policy director of think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research , says it 's something business and Government needs to think about .
" That tap of Polish workers is going to run dry .
And I fear that policymakers have n't quite grasped the immense challenge that might bring because if the Poles do n't do the jobs , who will ? "
This could prove particularly sticky for the construction industry .
Poland is investing in big infrastructure projects as it prepares to co-host the 2012 European championships .
It is starting to lure back the plumbers and carpenters who have been rebuilding Britain .
With the zloty rising against the pound , will they stay ?
Kris Ruszczynski's construction company , Polonia , had 50 builders working on the refit of the Home Office until the end of the year .
" There is a shift and it hit me hard , nearly 30 % of my team did n't come back after Christmas . "
Britain , of course , has its own little bash in 2012 .
Add to that the Government 's commitment to build three million new homes and Crossrail , and that 's a lot of builders .
The Federation of Master Builders estimates that 87,500 new builders are needed every year for the next five years .
If the Poles head for home , it 's going to set back major infrastructure projects like the Olympics , says spokesman Bryan Berry .
" The bigger problem is that we wo n't be able to find enough labour . "
Pick your own
The effect of a Polish exodus could be even greater for the agricultural sector .
Scripps Farm in Kent has seen many seasons of fruitfulness .
Their million apple and pear trees supply fruit to some of the biggest supermarkets .
All of the fruits have to be picked by hand and for the past four years , managing director James Simpson has relied mainly on Poles .
Will crops rot rather than be picked ?
Last summer that changed .
" The Poles and the Czechs were n't knocking on the door the way they were two or three years ago . "
The farm 's Polish contingent is down by a third on previous years , and without them the farm could n't have expanded .
Campaigner Andrew Green of Migration Watch thinks we overestimate how beneficial the Poles have been .
He says they have been good for business but not our economy as a whole .
" The question is do we import apples or apple pickers ?
From the point of view of society and our economy as a whole we ought to be importing the apples . "
Even in Kent , expensive strawberry crops have been left to rot as there were n't the migrants to pick them .
The Poles are n't just picking apples or cleaning floors .
There are many thousand in skilled jobs and their departure could mean whole businesses packing up and following them .
One third of the staff at Axis Electronics , which makes circuitry at its Bedfordshire factory , are Polish .
Without them , managing director Phil Innes says the company would have opened a factory abroad .
" It 's not something we wanted to do but we would have struggled to recruit locally for the growth we have been through . "
Cheap labour Mr Green says businesses have taken the easy option and not invested in local workers enough .
" The employers are laughing all the way to the bank .
They 've got cheap , flexible , over - qualified , motivated workers .
But it 's bad for the low paid , it 's pretty much neutral for the rest of us . "
Migrants often do work few Britons are prepared to The estimated million Poles who have made it to Britain since 2004 have allowed the UK to paper over fundamental problems , particularly a lack of skilled workers .
David Frost , chief executive of the British Chambers of Commerce , says it 's not just the skills that make Poles attractive to employers .
" There is an attitude and work ethic problem in certain parts of the UK where people do not see the need or have the desire to work . "
On Polish expat websites , the hot topic is who is going back and when .
While many migrant workers will stay for a lot longer , if not for good , one of the key factors is the exchange rate .
The Polish zloty has strengthened against the pound since 2004 - then £ 1 would buy 7 zloty and today it 's about 4.8 , which means less money to send home .
" We are quite confused , we do n't know what we should do , " says Kasia Kopacz , editor of the Polish Times .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Julius Derico Jr. did n't need to travel to the Vietnam Memorial Wall in Washington to pay tribute to his fallen comrade -- the first casualty of his unit in Vietnam .
Users can search the digitized Vietnam War Memorial Wall for details about soldiers who died .
As he huddled around a computer with other veterans , he searched for his friend 's name in a newly digitized version of the Wall .
While it 's just one of the Wall 's 58,320 names , Derico said he hopes people understand that it represents something more than just an inscription .
The virtual Wall , a project created by the National Archives and Footnote.com , brings the memorial to millions of American homes .
The Web site , unveiled last week , links names to casualty reports , historical documents and digital photographs , and allows users to leave online tributes to those who died .
See the new project be unveiled in Washington »
To create the digital image , photographers used more than 6,000 photographs of the Wall , which measures about 460 feet wide .
Ten Vietnam veterans at an American Legion Post 911 in Atlanta , Georgia , gathered to test the online Wall for CNN.com .
They said they believe the new Wall gives a face to each of the names , and helps keep their memories alive .

" We can use that to help console people ...
To help people realize that ... they are gone but they are not forgotten , " Derico said .
" We can show it to you [ online ] .
Your brother , your sister ...
They 're still there ; they are being thought of and they are being treated with due respect . "
Derico will never forget .
The thought of that first death in his unit still chokes him up .
David Perkett was killed one night when a fellow soldier accidentally discharged his weapon .
At the age of 20 , Derico had to identify the body .
It was not prepped .
It was not cleaned .
His comrade was covered in dried blood .
" It was devastating , " Derico said , visibly shaken .
As some people searched the virtual Wall for people they knew , others shouted names from across the room , hoping someone would enter a search in the computer .
Some only knew the first names and hoped to match them with the database by unit or hometown .
As they found more names , the group grew in size , huddling closer together as they read the casualty report of the latest name .
For Robert Love , who served in Vietnam as a mechanic , being able to view the Wall with fellow comrades gives the memorial new meaning .
As he used the online version , he reflected on a trip to Washington , where he visited the Wall .
" I had so many different emotions ; and then after a while , as you begin to look at the names on the wall , it overwhelms you , " he said .
" Then you realize that you could be up there , but by the grace of God you are n't . "
As he sat with his fellow servicemen Friday , reflecting on the war and sharing memories of those who died , some of the pain eased .

As they located familiar names and learned more about them , the group 's excitement grew .
Everyone agreed that other veterans should know about the site , and they agreed to spread the word .
Some suggested including the site Stand Down -- an event that helps homeless and indigent veterans by providing them with food , clothing and other necesseties .
So many veterans end up with no home , no benefits , no money and drug problems , Love said .
Many are simply stuck in a cycle , unable to let go of the horror of war .
" War is hell .
There 's no other way to put it .
And when an individual goes into a situation where he or she takes the life of another individual , it 's devastating and you never really get over it , " he said .
" At times , when you go to sleep at night , you see just like you were there .
You wake up in a cold sweat -- scared ; and after so long it starts wearing on your body . "
" It 's an excellent opportunity for them to come in and look back on what happened to them in Vietnam , " Derico said .
" For them to look back on the people they lost in Vietnam .
And guess what ?
It may even shock them to the extent that they come back to reality . "

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China has earmarked 41.8 billion yuan ( $ 5.9 billion ) to fund environmental protection and energy - saving projects this year , the finance ministry said on Monday .
In a statement posted on its Web site , www.mof.gov.cn, the ministry said the funds would be used to scrap obsolete capacity , improve sewerage in central and western China and clean up several rivers across the country .
It also said that China would consider setting up a “ pay to pollute ” regime and a trading system for pollution quotas .
The investments underscore the growing political emphasis on sustainable development in a country with some of the world ’s most polluted air and rivers .
In 2006 , China set a goal of cutting energy intensity , or the amount of energy needed to produce each $ 1 of output , by 20 percent by 2010 , but it has already fallen well behind schedule .
Energy intensity fell 1.33 percent in 2006 and 3 percent in 2007 .
China has also cracked down on loans to polluters and raised the bar for investment in heavy industries such as cement , steel and smelting that consume large quantities of energy and belch out pollution .

No - Fly List to Be Scrubbed
After over five years of harassing innocents and not catching any terrorists , the no-fly list is finally being checked for accuracy , and probably cut in half .
Yes , it ’s great to see that even the threat of oversight by a Democratic Congress is enough to get these things done , but it ’s nowhere near enough .
The no -fly list does n’t work .
And , of course , you can easily bypass it .
You can 1 ) print a boarding pass under an assumed name or buy a ticket under an assumed name , or 2 ) fly without ID .
In fact , the whole notion of checking ID as a security measure is fraught with problems .
And the list itself is just awful .
My favorite sound bite :
Imagine a list of suspected terrorists so dangerous that we can’t ever let them fly , yet so innocent that we ca n’t arrest them – even under the draconian provisions of the Patriot Act .
Even with a better list , it ’s a waste of money .

When you are working in a shell you certainly do n't want to waste your time using arrow keys or home / end keys to navigate around the command line .
One of the most popular shells , bash - Bourne Again SHell , uses GNU 's Readline library for reading the command line .
The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in .
The readline library also includes functions to maintain a list of previously - entered command lines , to recall and perhaps reedit those lines , and perform csh - like history expansion on previous commands .
Both emacs and vi editing modes are available .
I have mastered both of the editing modes and have created cheat sheets for both of them ( and a tiny separate one for readline 's history expansion ) .
This is a cheat sheet for the default , emacs , editing mode .
Here are a few examples with screenshots on how to use this editing mode .
Let '[ ] ' be the position of cursor in all the examples .
Example 1 : movement basics
Suppose you are at the end of the line and want to move 3 words backwards .
$ echo word1 word2 word3 word4 word5 word6 < strong >[ ]</ strong >
If you hit M - 3 followed by M-b , you would end up exactly where you wanted :
$ echo word1 word2 word3 < strong >[ ]</strong>word4 word5 word6
An alternative is to hit M - b three times in a row : M-b M-b M-b
If you look up on the cheat sheet what M - 3 does , it sets the numeric - argument to 3 which in this case acts as a counter how many times should M-b command be repeated .
The M-b command calls backward - word function which does the obvious .
The numeric - argument can also be negative , which makes the argument to be applied in the opposite direction .
Other shortcuts of interest are M-f to move forward and C - a , and C-e to move to the beginning and end of line .
Example 2 : command history
Suppose you used a pretty complex command a while ago and now you remember just a few arguments of this command .
You want to find this command and call it with a few arguments modified .
If you hit C-r readline will put you in an incremental reverse history search mode .
Typing a part of the arguments you remember , will locate the previously executed command matching the typed text .
Hitting C-r again will locate any other command which matches your typed text .
To put the found command on command line for editing hit C-j .
Example 3 : completing
Suppose you want to quickly list all the users on the system .
Hit C-x ~ and read - line will attempt username completion and output all the usernames to the terminal .
$ < strong > [ ]</ strong > adm catonmat ftp halt mailnull nobody root smmsp vcsa apache cpanel games lp mysql nscd rpc sshd bin daemon gopher mail named operator rpm sync cat dbus haldaemon mailman news picurls shutdown uucp $ < strong > [ ]</ strong >
Suppose you now want to quickly list all the users on the system starting with ' m ' .
You can type ' m ' followed by the same C-x ~ to do that .
$ m<strong >[ ]</ strong > mail mailman mailnull mysql $ m< strong >[ ]</ strong >
The other interesting completions are :
C-x / which lists possible filename completion ,
which lists possible filename completion , C-x $ which lists possible bash variable completion ,
which lists possible bash variable completion , C-x @ which lists possible hostname completion and ,
which lists possible hostname completion and , C-x ! which lists possible command completion .
and
Meta -/ which does filename completion ,
which does filename completion , Meta - $ which does bash variable completion ,
which does bash variable completion , Meta -@ which does hostname completion and ,
which does hostname completion and , Meta -! which does command completion .
Example 3 : killing and yanking
Suppose you have to type a - long - word - like - this a couple of times .
The easiest way to do this is to kill the word , which puts it into the kill ring .
Contents of the kill ring can be accessed by yanking .
For example , type ' a - long - word - like - this ' in the shell :
$ command a - long - word - like - this < strong > [ ]</ strong >
Now press C-w to kill one word backward :
$ command < strong > [ ]</ strong >
Press C-y to yank ( paste ) the word as many times as you want ( I pressed it 3 times here : )
$ command a - long - word - like - this a - long - word - like - this a - long - word - like - this < strong > [ ]</ strong >
The kill ring does not contain just the one latest killing .
It can be filled with a number of kills and rotated with M-y shortcut .
Another example :
Suppose you typed a longer command and you noticed that part of the THE TEXT GOT TYPED IN CAPITAL LETTERS .
Without knowing the readline shortcuts you would erase the text and probably type it again .
Now you can use the readline keyboard shortcuts and change the case very , very quickly .
You can use the following shortcuts to accomplish this :
1 ) M-l ( Meta-l ( on your computer , probably ESC- l ) ) shortcut is bound to readline 's downcase - word function which lowercases the current word .
2 ) M-b shortcut is bound to readline 's backward - word function which moves the cursor one word backwards .
3 ) M-< number > shortcut is bound to readline 's numeric - argument function which in some cases acts as how many times should the following command be repeated .
Here is a real word example , suppose we have typed the following ( [ ] is the cursor ) :
$ echo the text .
THE TEXT GOT TYPED IN CAPITAL LETTERS < strong >[ ]</ strong >
To get to the beginning of ' THE ' we might repetitively hit M - b seven times or we could set the numeric argument to seven by typing M - 7 and then hit M-b once .
After doing this the cursor would have moved before the word ' THE ' :
$ echo the text .
< strong >[ ]</ strong>THE
TEXT GOT TYPED IN CAPITAL LETTERS
Now , by setting the numerical argument to 7 again and by pressing M-l or by pressing M-l seven times , we turn the text all in lower case .
$ echo the text .
the text got typed in capital letters < strong > [ ]</ strong >
Actually what we did in this example was not as efficient as it could have been .
The numeric - argument shortcut accepts negative arguments which turn the direction of the following command in other direction .
We could have turned the text in lower case by hitting M - - 7 and M-l
If you really want to be more productive , I suggest you play around with the commands in the cheat sheet for a while .
My previous article on being more productive on the command line was screen 's cheat sheet which allows to emulate multiple terminals in a single window .
You can take a look at it as well !

The next cheat sheet will be about vi editing mode 's keyboard shortcuts .
See you then !
Trans -Atlantic Identity Crisis NATO Summit Fails to Heal Deep Divisions
The smiles in Bucharest were little more than show .
Politically , the NATO summit was a fiasco .
The Western alliance remains deeply divided and faces an identity crisis -- with Russian relations just one of the alliance 's many points of dispute .
Today marks the official release of Adobe AIR , a platform for developing desktop applications using web - based technologies .
Let 's see what this tool offers and what security implications it carries .
Adobe AIR ( once known as Adobe Apollo ) is a run-time environment that bundles several web - enabling technologies and makes them available on the desktop .
According to Adobe 's Mike Chambers , Adobe AIR " leverages a number of open source technologies , " including :
Tamarin - implements JavaScript/ECMAScript , used in Firefox , Flash
SQLite - lightweight database engine
WebKit - renders HTML , used by Konqueror browser in KDE and Safari
Adobe AIR allows developers who know how to write traditional web - based applications to use their skills ( HTML , AJAX , Flash , etc. ) to write local desktop applications .
Applications built using Adobe AIR include AOL Top 100 Videos player , eBay Desktop , and NASDAQ Market Replay .
ISC reader Richard Gurley emailed us a question regarding security concerns associated with the this powerful development platform .
Two categories of threat vectors come to mind :
A malicious Adobe AIR application may act as a trojan and do " bad things " to the victim 's local system .
A web - style vulnerability ( XSS , etc. ) in an Adobe AIR application may allow an attacker to target the application 's data or the victim 's local system .
Desktop - Specific Threats of Adobe AIR Applications
The set of first threat vectors is similar across desktop applications that run locally .
Adobe implemented sandboxing to limit some actions a local Adobe AIR application .
Adobe 's documentation makes it clear that the sandboxes are not meant to mimic the rigorous restrictions of a web browser 's sandbox .
Adobe AIR FAQ points out that " applications deployed on Adobe AIR have powerful desktop capabilities and access to local data . "
Adobe AIR applications need to be digitally signed , to assist the end - user in determining whether to trust the application 's author .
However , the certificates can be self - signed , and many users will ignore the trust warnings and run even those applications that come from untrusted sources .
This is not a new issue , and it is not unique to Adobe AIR .
Ron Schmelzer , an analyst at ZapThink , expressed his concerns with the ability of existing anti-virus tools to protect against rogue Adobe AIR applications in an October 2 , 2007 , InfoWorld article :
" ' The current generation of spyware , virus , and malware [ detection ] products have no visibility into running AIR programs , ' Schmelzer wrote in an e-mail .
' As such , there is a high possibility for malicious AIR applications -- which are no longer security - restricted to the browser sandbox and are free to manipulate local machines -- to spread into the wild . ' "
I am more optimistic about the ability of existing anti-virus suites to detect improper actions of an Adobe AIR application through behavioral techniques that observe any local programs .
Such techniques involve checking for suspicious registry , file system , and network actions that a malicious application would exhibit regardless of the framework within it operates .
However , since I have not experimented with Adobe AIR applications , this is purely a hypothetical assessment .
( Perhaps those more familiar with inner-workings of anti-virus tools or with Adobe AIR applications would like to comment ? )
Web -Specific Threats of Adobe AIR Applications
The other , and perhaps more significant set of threats to consider is tied to those of any web applications .
Vulnerabilities in a web application could allow an attacker to launch attacks based on Cross - Site Scripting ( XSS ) , SQL injection , local link injection , and other techniques associated with traditional web applications .
The most interesting security repercussion of a platform such as Adobe AIR is that it merges traditional web application techniques with the more - permissive security models of local applications .
Consider a hypothetical example where an Adobe AIR application allows the user to open and execute a local file .
An XSS - style vulnerability in an application could allow a remote attacker to inject a malicious JavaScript into the application that would attempt to execute a local program of the attacker 's choice .
This is more difficult to execute when the script runs within the confines of a web browser , than if the script runs within a more permissive sandbox of Adobe AIR .
Adobe 's Lucas Adamski wrote an excellent article describing the Adobe AIR security model .
In his write - up , Lucas describes the two sandboxes implemented by Adobe AIR and outlines the security risks that the developers of Adobe AIR applications need to consider .
He also points to the security documentation Adobe wrote to assist developers in addressing some of these challenges .
Lucas highlights the need for developers to follow Adobe 's security recommendations to create resilient applications :
" However , the privileges inherent in a full desktop application mean the developer can sometimes find ways around these restrictions .
The reality is that doing so will almost certainly introduce a large amount of security risk into the application and for the end users of the application .
Thus Adobe strongly recommends that developers stay within the restrictions placed by the AIR security model , and carefully consider the cost of implementing rigorous security mitigations for bypassing them .
In most cases the development cost of these mitigations will significantly exceed the cost of finding an alternative solution that stays within the bounds of the security model . "
Undoubtedly , many developers will be unaware of Adobe AIR security best practices or will knowingly take shortcuts that expose end -users to attacks .
Will our destkop lock - down practices and anti-virus tools compensate for such conditions ?
I hope the answer is " yes , " but I suppose only time will tell .
What are your thoughts on security implications of the Adobe AIR platform ?
Please let us know .

There is no doubt that this holiday season , one of the hottest gifts is the Nintendo Wii. Nintendo of America 's president , Reggie Fils - Aime , warned gamers months ago that supplies would be short and tried to alleviate the problem with a voucher program through GameStop .
It 's clear this wo n't be enough to meet demand , causing Nintendo to strongly urge retailers not to force consumers to buy bundles of software and accessories in order to take advantage of the shortage .
At Opposable Thumbs , we ran a post about how to deal with these bundles and asked readers to contact us with their horror stories .
One worker followed up quickly with his own twist on holiday price gouging : instead of selling the systems with bundles , a chain of Illinois / Missouri gaming stores called Slackers is simply dumping its stock onto eBay for the Buy It Now price of $ 399.99 , an almost $ 150 markup .
" In the past year , none of the 12 [ Slackers locations ] have sold any Wiis except for a one - time promotional deal , where we did force customers to buy a game with it , " the employee told Ars Technica .
" The real crime is that we get Wii shipments regularly .
In fact , right now we have about 20 , but none of them make it to the store front .
They all get put on the store 's eBay site at a minimum $ 499.99 buying price . "
Our source then told us that the price has since been lowered to $ 399.99 , ( they were n't moving at $ 499 ) and sure enough , there are three Wiis available through Slackers ' eBay storefront at $ 399.99 .
Looking back in the store 's history , one can find other Wii sales in its feedback , with the auction advertising " NEW WITH GAME . "
The game of course being the bundled Wii Sports .
Ars Technica contacted the St. Louis Slackers location for confirmation of the practice .
When asked if the allegations were true , there was a long silence .
" That is something you 'll have to speak with the owner about , " we were told .
We have since attempted to contact Slackers ' owner multiple times , but have been unsuccessful .
Nintendo has also not responded to our requests for comment on this story .
There are a couple of reasons Nintendo — and every other console manufacturer — is so strict on keeping one price point .
Raising the price in this way hurts Nintendo's ability to position the Wii as the low - cost system , and it also cuts Nintendo out of a share in the higher profits .
At the same time , Nintendo keeps retailers from offering the systems as low - priced loss leaders , dropping the console below the suggested retail price to get customers into the store .
Nintendo wants to be sure it controls the pricing , and Fils - Aime has talked in the past about the power of the Wii 's low price .
While dropping systems on eBay might seem like a quick and easy way for retailers like Slackers to make money , raising the price on Nintendo 's system for one 's own profit is a surefire way to get cut off from future shipments of games , systems , and accessories .
" We do n't have to remind retailers of the strength we have right now , " Fils - Aime said in a recent interview with Reuters .
" We are simply making an observation and that reinforces our point quite nicely with retailers . "
Nintendo does indeed have the strength right now , and our source also told us he has reported his employer 's practices to Nintendo .
Unfortunately , it 's unlikely that Slackers ' customers hungry for the system are aware that Wiis are apparently being stockpiled in the store room for eBayers willing to pay $ 400 instead of on store shelves at Nintendo 's MSRP of $ 249 .
So I updated one of my laptops to Ubuntu 8.04 pretty much as soon as it was available .
I ’ve been using my MacBook Pro laptop for everything for probably over a year now , because I grew tired of the hobby that * is* running Linux on a laptop and getting everything to work .
I ’ll note that I * do * run Linux on every server I maintain that I can think of 🙂
The first test for this laptop was wireless .
I bought this laptop ( Lenovo T61 ) specifically because it got rave reviews for its Linux compatibility .
I was careful to order the laptop with the proper video and wireless chipsets that had the best support .
However , 2 things annoyed me so much that I went back to the MacBook for everything :
Wireless hung , and hung often , and in a way that it was unrecoverable .
Lenovo put the Escape key in the worst place they could possibly put it , especially for a Vim user .
Changing the key mapping caused issues with other apps , and configuring the key mapping inside .vimrc does n’t help on the 30 other servers I use it on ( ssh ’d in from this laptop ) :-/
Really , it was the wireless that did it .
I work 100 % remotely on everything I do .
So , 8.04 seems to have fixed the wireless issues .
The next thing I wanted to do was check out all of the Python IDE / editors I could n’t use on the Mac ( or , not easily ) .
So I used Synaptic Package Manager to install all of the ones I could find .
I ’m sorry to say that I personally had Problems with most of them :
DrPython launched fine , but using the file browser to open a file resulted in …. a no-op .
I ’m sorry , but an editor needs to be able to open a file .
PyPE failed to launch altogether !
It looks like it ’s going to open , it spins for 5 - 10 seconds , and then just disappears .
No window is ever shown , but a tab does appear in the bar on the bottom of the screen .
Pida allows you to choose an external editor , so I chose Vim , and that kinda worked , but I really just want the key bindings , not the whole editor , and there ’s no option to use some default built - in editor that has code folding and autocompletion and stuff .
It appeared to me to be so close to gvim that I decided to skip it .
I tried to stick around and give it a chance by reading the docs , but alas , the only thing under “ Help ” is “ About ” .
Seems there are still a number of open source developers more concerned with getting credit than getting users .
Stani’s Python Editor looked pretty nice , but I could n’t find any easy way to change the syntax coloring , and while there is a manual , you have to donate to get your hands on it .
This is nonsense .
If you want to sell some kind of advanced documentation , fine , but you ca n’t expect me to donate to a project that I do n’t even know if I want to use yet !
“ Please pay me so that you can see if this product fits your needs ” …. it just does n’t work that way .
What you ’ve done is given me a product that is complex enough that you pretty much need a manual just to get started , and then deprived me of that .
Why not just give me the manual and a 30 day trial , after which I have to donate ?
I ’d have no problem doing that if I planned on keeping it around .
In fact , that ’s how plenty of Mac applications work .
I ’ll pay for software that does what I need , but this game that ’s being played is just offensive .
Eclipse with PyDev , I can use this , but I do n’t like it a whole lot .
The good news is that there ’s an SVN plugin ( subclipse ) , and a plugin for vi keybindings if I want to pay for it ( it ’s only $ 20 – not bad if you use it a lot ) .
The interface is a little clunky to me , and there ’s no easy “ change your syntax color scheme to this ” type functionality .
If you want a dark background and light colored text , you actually have to go to one place to change the background color , the color of the line numbering area , etc. , and then go to another place to change the colors associated with the different elements of your particular language .
That ’s annoying for two reasons : first , it ’ll take forever to get things the way I want , and second , if I installed this on another machine , I could n’t just move over some kind of theme file and have my settings ready to go ( as far as I know ) .
In the end , it looks like my three favorite editors are still Komodo Editor , JEdit , and Vim .
What ’s your favorite Python editor for Linux ?
The Senate ( reportedly still under Democratic control ) seems determined to help President Bush violate Americans ’ civil liberties and undermine the constitutional separation of powers .
Majority Leader Harry Reid is supporting
White House - backed legislation that would expand the administration ’s ability to spy on Americans without court supervision and ensure that the country never learns the full extent of Mr. Bush ’s illegal wiretapping program .
The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , or FISA  which Mr. Bush decided to ignore after 9/11  requires a warrant to intercept telephone calls and e-mail messages between people in the United States and people abroad .
It needed updating to keep pace with technology , and the technical fixes were included in a bill that Congress passed last summer .
The problem was that Mr. Bush managed to add measures that sharply undercut the court ’s role in monitoring eavesdropping .
Fortunately , lawmakers gave them an expiration date of Feb .
1 .
The House has passed a reasonable new bill  fixing FISA without further endangering civil liberties .
But Mr. Bush wants to weaken FISA as much as he can .
And the Senate leadership has been only too happy to oblige .
Cheney spoke yesterday at CPAC , the conference for people for whom reality is just an illusion foisted upon them by a cold and liberal universe .
( The universe , you see , is full of dark matter called Librons , which in addition to keeping the universe from flying apart like Ann Coulter in front of a television camera , have the unfortunate side effect of inverting perceptions of reality for all but the most trained Randian observers .
Oh , and Scientologists . )
I 'm supposed to say , at this point , something like " you ca n't make this up " , but of course you can make this stuff up .
It 's easy to make it up .
That 's the whole point .
Some highlights ...
As conservatives , we believe in a government that takes up a smaller share of the national income , that treats tax dollars with respect and restraint .
And we believe in a government that keeps to its limits under the Constitution , never expanding beyond the consent of the governed .
And then , he farted candy and rainbows .
And all the little woodland creatures came out from under the floorboards to help sew him a magnificent new dress for the ball .
The United States is a country that takes human rights seriously .
We do not torture -- it 's against our laws and against our values .
We 're proud of our country and what it stands for . [...]
America is a fair and a decent country .
( Applause . )
President Bush has made it clear , both publicly and privately , that our duty to uphold the laws and standards of this nation admit no exceptions in wartime .
As he put it , " We are in a fight for our principles , and our first responsibility is , live by them .
And at that point , the Constitution Fairy sprinkled her magic Constitution dust over the land , and all the tapes of the CIA torturing prisoners magically erased themselves , and the waterboarded detainees became un- waterboarded , and the vast program of illegal domestic espionage -- so critical to our national security that President George Constitution Bush has threatened to veto all FISA legislation , for all time , unless everyone involved gets retroactive amnesty for their illegal acts -- suddenly became Constitutional .
To prevail in the long run , we have to remove the conditions that inspire such blind , prideful hatred that drove 19 men to get into airplanes and come kill us .
And so the President made the decision :
We would n't just remove the Taliban and Saddam Hussein and let other dictators rise in their place .
Because one of the lesser known Articles of the Constitution is that no mention of 9/11 by an administration official may take place without a possibly hallucinatory - drug - induced conflation of it and Saddam Hussein .
And Shrek .
Shrek was also there .
I like it .
Reality as practiced by a man who can't tell the difference between a grown man standing next to him and a tiny , barely - flight - capable bird .
It 's not so much a CPAC speech as it is " NAMBLA for the mind . "
It 's a comic book speech , delivered by a comic book man to a comic book audience .
Cheney does n't believe in merely denying reality , he believes in pinning it down , attaching electrodes to it , then just clubbing it to death for fun .
The thing is , it'd be easy to ascribe behavior like this to mental illness , presuming he really believes any of the things he says .
But it 's not clear he does .
In all likelihood , he knows fully well how ridiculous it all sounds , but in an audience hand - picked for their willingness to accept any premise , no matter how ridiculous , in order to feel good about their own bigotries , nobody will ever call him out on it .
It 's interesting , because once again one would think it would be a key component of rational public discourse for people to , indeed , call him out on his happy , camouflage - colored delusions .
But it 's somehow off - limits , in the press , to point out when a public official is an unmitigated , reality - sodomizing liar .
Haircuts and pantsuits : fair game .
Pointing out that " a smaller share of the national income " means " a larger share " , that " restrained " spending means " more " spending , that " keeping to the limits of the Constitution " means breaking those limits , that " no torture " means " torture " , and that " 9/11 " means anything else he wants it to mean at any moment in time : pointing those things out are uncouth activities to be delegated to people like Jon Stewart , Stephen Colbert , Keith Olbermann , and a handful of crazy , uncivilized blogs .
And we 're reduced to just making fun of it , because really -- what else are you going to do ?
How do you refute something that 's self - refuting ?
Go figure .
In today 's pseudoscience news , the quality press is alive with the findings by UK psych researchers that people can fairly reliably tell how slutty someone is merely by looking at a picture of their face .
Psychologists at several UK universities teamed up on the research , which will plainly lead in short order to the betterment of humanity .
The link between looking dirty and being a tramp was firmly established for both sexes .
This was done by asking students to fill out questionnaires regarding how likely they were to put out , how often they had done so lately etc .
Data from such questionnaires is well known to be solidly grounded in fact .
This done , the subjects were photographed .
Other students were then asked to look at the photographed faces and say how easy they reckoned the pictured individual might be .
In a staggering 72 per cent of cases , they correctly guessed whether the person in the portrait was or was not a slag .
Or at least , whether or not they were likely to admit being a slag on an anonymous questionnaire .
" We may be subtly aware of other people ’s attitudes to sex , " says Dr Lynda Boothroyd of Durham Uni , lead author of the groundbreaking slapper - spotting research .
" What is far more interesting is that despite the subtlety of the explicit awareness ... there is a very strong tendency for women to be attracted to ... men who are less interested in casual sex .
Men have the opposite preference with female faces ; they strongly prefer the [ easy ] women . "
Participants were also asked to rate faces on how masculine / feminine they looked , and the researchers believe this shows a connection between masculine aspect in men and a tendency to be anyone 's after a couple of drinks .
It seems that the study also supports the idea that " male masculinity " has " negative connotations ... for long term partnerships " .
In other words , manly men are easy , and women do n't like that .
Or put another way : " Androgenisation in men is related to less restricted sexual behaviour ... women are averse to unrestricted men . "
Comfort , then , for any chaps out there who do n't look very studly and do n't get much action - it seems women are much more attracted to your type .
Even if they sometimes have an odd way of showing it .

One of the greatest threats to the preclinical research necessary for science - based medicine today is animal rights activism .
The magnitude of the problem came to the forefront again last week with the news that animal rights terrorists tried to enter the home of a researcher at the University of California Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) whose research uses mice to study breast cancer and neurologic disease while she and her husband were having a birthday party for one of their children and assaulted her husband , who had gone to the front of the house to confront them .
Fortunately , the license plate number of the car fleeing the scene was reported to police , leading to a raid on a house by police and the confiscation of computers and other materials .
This attack appeared to be the latest crescendo in an increasing campaign of harrassment and intimidation by animal rights “ activists ” that has also been observed in nearby Berkeley .
This sort of threat to researchers is not a problem just in Santa Cruz and the Bay area , but in particular has been a problem in southern California as well .
Just earlier this week , the University of California Los Angeles announced that it was suing several animal rights groups and individuals suspected of attacks on researchers who use animals , including UCLA Primate Freedom Project , the Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) , and the Animal Liberation Brigade ( ALB ) , as well as several individuals believed to affiliate with these groups .
The inciting event for this action was the second attack on the home of Edythe London , Professor of Psychiatry and Bio- behavioral Sciences and of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA , in early February .
Her research involves the use of primate models to study nicotine addiction .
In this most recent attack , an attempt was made to set her house on fire .
This came on the heels of a previous attack in October , in which animal rights activists flooded her house .
Prior to that , animal rights terrorists had indeed succeeded in their aim of intimidating a scientist sufficiently that he gave up animal research after a fellow researcher was targeted with a Molotov cocktail meant for her home that was mistakenly placed on the porch of an elderly neighbor .
Also , we in the U.S. often forget how much more radical animal rights extremists are in the U.K. , where the campaign of intimidation takes the form of death threats , intimidation of personnel of companies that supply researchers , and even in one case digging up the grave of Gladys Hammond , whose family ran a farm that raised Guinea pigs for use in medical research , and stealing her remains .
Readers may make the argument that my introduction to this discussion is unfairly inflammatory , but I have my reasons for starting this way , and I think they are good ones .
First , make no mistake , the aim of the most radical of these activists is nothing short of the cessation of the use of all animals in biomedical research .
Second , sooner or later , someone will be hurt or killed .
As a researcher who on occasion uses mouse models of cancer myself , I state up front that I could be on the firing line just as much as the UCSC researcher or others and am justifiably disturbed when I hear spokesperson for the ALF Dr. Jerry Vlasak , for example , repeatedly advocate violence against researchers who use animals .
In this article , I am not going to discuss the moral issues involved in animal research .
What I am going to discuss is the seemingly scientific arguments that some opponents of animal research and animal rights activists like to invoke , arguments increasingly used in addition to the moral arguments that extremists use to justify their actions .
If the arguments of opponents of animal rights research were indeed good science , then their appropriation by extremists would not allow me to do much other than bemoan the misuse of valid science as a justification for extremism .
Unfortunately , such is not the case , and the bad scientific arguments used by opponents of animal research are often piled onto the extreme moral arguments that fuel actions such as those earlier this week at UCSC .
Consequently , given the events of the last month or so , I thought I would take this opportunity to look at some of the common scientific indictments of animal research by its opponents .
If you examine various websites or literature from animal rights extremists looking at the issue of animal use in medical research , the forms of the scientific arguments tend , when you boil them down to the very core of their essence , to take three main forms , which are related :
Animal research does n’t teach us anything of value or even misleads us ( i.e. , it is bad science ) .
Animal research does not predict human physiology or response to disease , or animals are “ just too different from humans to give reliable results ” ( i.e. , it is bad science ) .
There are better ways of getting the information that do not use animals ( i.e. , there is better science available than using animals . )
I tend to look at these arguments as three faces of what is in essence the same argument , specifically what I like to call an “ argument from imperfection . ”
In other words , because animal models have many difficulties and flaws and all too often do n’t predict human physiology or drug response as well as the critics think that they should , then by implication all animal research is bad science .
It is an example of demanding 100 % perfection or certainty , a bar that no science can ever meet and of concrete thinking typical of extremists .
( Creationists and “ alternative ” medicine mavens are particularly fond of this sort of argument against their hated “ Darwinism ” or “ allopathic ” or “ conventional ” medicine–usually said with a sneer –respectively . )
In its most ridiculous form , this argument takes the form of claiming that cell culture and computer models , among other modalities , can give us the same information without animals .
The first reason that this argument is ridiculous is that cell culture models tend to be even less predictive of many responses than animal models for many questions and because much physiology depends upon the interaction of different cell types in their native three dimensional matrix .
The second reason is that , for a computer model to be adequately predictive , it needs ( 1 ) sufficient information to input and ( 2 ) sufficient understanding of the intricacies of the physiology and biochemistry .
We do n’t have either .
Finally , physiology requires understanding at the macroscopic level of how organs interact .
Of course , these arguments are often made in less extreme forms , and I will discuss a some of these shortly .
Keep in mind as I do , though , that the problem inherent in this sort of argument is that one has to look at what the alternatives to animal research are and compare their usefulness , accuracy , and reliability .
If one ca n’t show that one ’s alternative is better than animal research , then all the complaints about the imperfections of animal research do n’t amount to much .
It ’s still the best that we have , and , as such , it ’s bad science ( and unethical , to boot ) not to use it before trying therapies in humans .
I have yet to see a compelling argument that any alternative modality predicts human response to disease and treatment well enough that we should rely on it instead of animal models .
The first of the three arguments , namely that animal research does n’t teach us anything of value or even misleads us , is the easiest to deal with .
Keep in mind that I am a cancer researcher and surgeon ; consequently , my knowledge of applying animal research to cancer is stronger than for the use of animals in other fields .
For example , when I see animal rights activists claim that human stem cells can be used instead of various animal models of cancer , it ’s hard for me not to want to grab them by the lapels , shake them , and point out that cancer stem cells were first discovered by a researcher who observed that only a small fraction of leukemic cells in a mouse–yes , mouse !
–model of leukemia could transmit the cancer from one experimental model to another .
Since it is not currently possible to transmit leukemia from one person to another and would be incredibly unethical to try , the conclusion I draw from this is that whoever wrote that FAQ is ignorant of recent medical history .
Indeed , Americans for Medical Progress is quite correct in pointing out how the judicious use of animal models has led to improvements in understanding and treatment of a number of diseases , such as cancer , asthma , HIV / AIDs , antibiotics , organ transplantation , and far more .
My favorite example to cite when I hear the argument that other methods besides animal research can do better than animal research in helping us understand disease ( or , in its more sophisticated form , that animals may have been needed a few decades ago to discover , say , insulin , but our understanding has advanced to the point where they are no longer needed ) comes from my field and my area of research interest .
It also happens to come from my scientific hero , Dr. Judah Folkman , who passed away suddenly in January .
It shows an area of cancer biology whose importance would have been incredibly difficult to model , appreciate , or target for therapy without mouse models of cancer .
That area , of course , is tumor angiogenesis , and Dr. Folkman did his pioneering work that has now resulted in drugs like Avastin and other antiangiogenic drugs that are making it to market now and making a real impact on cancer .
Dr. Folkman did it through an ingenious strategy that began from the clinical observation that sometimes tumor metastases appear shortly after the operation to remove the primary tumor .
Folkman found a mouse tumor model that mimicked this behavior and in the early 1990s did a series of pioneering experiments .
In a strain Lewis lung carcinoma cells of low metastatic potential ( LLC - LM ) , when cells are injected into C57BL / 6 mice and allowed to grow subcutaneously , if the tumor is left alone , mice develop only microscopic lung metastases .
These metastases do not grow and kill the mouse .
If , however , the primary cancer is removed , then many large lung metastases grow rapidly .
The results of the experiment above strongly implied that the primary tumor is secreting something that suppresses the growth of microscopic metastases .
After this , the Folkman group did what we like to call “ brute force ” science , collecting mouse urine and analyzing it for tumor suppressive activity until they were able to purify a single 38 kDa peptide , which they designated angiostatin .
This involved analyzing literally gallons of mouse urine .
( Who said science is n’t glamorous ? )
Once Folkman ’s group had a bunch of angiostatin on hand , it peformed the following experiment .
Two groups of mice were injected with LLC -LM and the tumors allowed to grow to a certain size , after which they were surgically removed .
One group was treated with angiostatin , and the control group with saline .
The result was that the control group developed massive lung metastases and died , while the group treated with angiostatin had microsocopic lung metastases that never grew beyond a ball of cells .
Dr. Folkman then demonstrated that it was the inhibition of angiogenesis by the angiostatin that kept these tumors in check .
Ultimately , he used a similar method to discover endostatin , and later he demonstrated that endostatin could induced tumor dormancy in mice .
I trust that the reader can see how these seminal preclinical observations about angiogenesis would have been virtually impossible without animal models , given that angiogenesis requires the interaction between tumor cells , cells in blood vessels , and the surrounding tissue stroma to occur .
There are numerous other examples of how animal research allows us to do things that we ca n’t do in humans and discover things that ca n’t be discovered using just cell culture or human experimentation .
Angiogenesis could n’t have been discovered through tissue culture , and computer models need the concept and measurements of a pheneomenon ’s behavior to be useful .
Before Folkman , although angiogenesis was suspected to be important in tumor growth , it was n’t known to be so .
My favorite other example is transgenic mice .
The technology of making transgenic mice allows scientists to selectively delete a single gene ( or multiple genes ) and observe the effects that occur in the animal when this happens .
P.Z. Myers at Pharyngula has written extensively of one class of genes whose functions in guiding vertebrate development and pattern formation were dissected largely through the use of both Drosophila models and transgenic mouse models , the homeobox genes , and indeed one of my two major areas of research interest involves the study of a diverged homeobox gene .
Through these models , we have been able to study not only the structure and function of HOX genes in a manner not possible without animal models , but we ’ve been able to trace the evolution of the genes all the way from worms , to fruit flies , to mice , to humans , even to the point of studying how plants and animals are related at a genetic level .
These sorts of studies allow us to examine the effect of genes at the whole organism level in a manner that is not possible any other way , and , indeed , sometimes produce strikingly surprising results that lead to new avenues of research .
Another common argument of animal rights activists is that “ animal testing ” is a very poor means of predicting human response to drugs or other therapies .
This argument is closer to the true situation than the first one , and no scientist involved in animal research would deny that there are all too often serious problems in using animal models this way .
The problem is , there are even more serious problems using other methods to predict toxicity , drug response , and other parameters in human beings .
The most recent example of this type of argument I ’ve seen comes from , of all places , a recent issue of Skeptic , in which animal research opponents Niall Shank ( a professor of philosophy who , oddly enough , authored a book critiquing intelligent design ) , Dr. Ray Greek ( an anaesthesiologist and President of Americans for Medical Advancement , Europeans for Medical Advancement , and Japanese for Medical Advancement , all facets of a single group that appears to be totally opposed to animal research in medicine ) , Nathan Nobis ( another philosopher ) , and Jean Swingle - Greek ( a veterinarian ) authored an article entitled Animals and Medicine : Do Animal Experiments Predict Human Responses ?
Unfortunately , the text is not available online , but , given that it is a fairly long article , I will summarize and excerpt judiciously to give you a flavor of their thesis and trust my cobloggers and anyone else who has read the article to keep me honest .
I will also , when I deem appropriate , include statements from Dr. Greek ’s organization in my discussion , given that the Skeptic article clearly flows from the same sorts of rationales found there .
In essence , the article consists of arguments # 2 and # 3 above writ large , with a the additional tactic of setting impossible standards for animal research to meet before they would concede that it is necessary .
First , it should be pointed out that the authors concede that “ fundamental biological discoveries in the past three centuries were made by studying animals ” and that “ animal studies continue to be of important scientific value in the context of basic biological and biomedical research . ”
Of course , given that they make this concession , it ’s odd that the authors can then argue that animal research is so useless in understanding human physiology and designing drug therapies , and they ca n’t resist disingenuously adding later something that makes me wonder if they truly understand clinical research :
Animal models claimed to be predictive of human responses are widely used in drug testing , environmental toxicology and disease research .
Animals , in the case of predictive models , are clearly used as substitutes for human subjects .
Unless researchers believed that such models were causally analogous to humans in relevant respects , there would be no rational basis for their use as predictive models .
Yes , and no .
Yes , we consider animal models to be somewhat predictive of human responses , but , no , we do not use animals as a substitute for human subjects .
If that were the case and animals were viewed as substitutes for humans in testing drugs , then there would be no need for such extensive clinical trials after animal studies were completed .
Rather , animal studies should be best viewed as the first test of a new drug or treatment on a whole - organism level in order to look for unexpected , toxic , or other effects that might not be apparent in cell culture .
In other words , animal tests are a screening process , not a substitute for human studies .
They are also a convenient tool that allows us to test hypotheses that we cannot test in humans , either for reasons of practicality or ethics .
We can certainly argue about how good a tool or screening test animal studies can be , but it is disingenuous and incorrect to argue so strongly that animals are meant to be “ substitutes ” for human subjects .
In fact , the argument above is consistent with , albeit a weaker statement of , part of the manifesto of Dr. Greek ’s organization , as stated on its website :
Americans For Medical Advancement ( AFMA ) / Europeans For Medical Advancement ( EFMA ) / Japanese For Medical Advancement ( JFMA ) is a mainstream science - based research and educational institute dedicated to improving policy and decision - making regarding the use of the animal model in biomedical research .
AFMA / EFMA /JFMA opposes animal - modeled research as a modality for seeking cures and treatments for human disease based on overwhelming scientific evidence that findings from animal models cannot be reliably extrapolated to humans .
We seek to demonstrate , through rigorous research and analysis , that the reliance on animal - modeled research , as well as other pseudoscientific endeavors , harms rather than helps humans , and prolongs human suffering by inhibiting medical progress .
If this is n’t dogmatic , I do n’t know what is , particularly the implied claim that all animal - modeled research is “ pseudoscientific . ”
Continuing in the Skeptic article , the authors then go on to list a number of references that supposedly show how horrible a tool animal studies are in terms of predicting human response .
They tend to pick the worst examples and put even examples that are not so bad in the worst possible light , arguing that animal studies are so inaccurate that they cause more harm than good .
That is a tenuous argument based on claims that false negatives and false positives generated by some animal research cause more harm than good by “ misleading ” researchers and that they “ directly ” harm patients by allowing harmful treatments to be tried on humans because they supposedly were found safe in animals , so much so that the whole enterprise should be scrapped as hopelessly irredeemable .
The latter claim is such a mischaracterization of clinical drug development that it makes me wonder if the authors honestly believe that drugs are approved for general use after only animal trials .
Apparently , they have never heard of a phase I clinical trial , where the goal is to give human volunteers increasing amounts of a new drug until toxicities are observed .
Animal studies serve , until more predictive studies are found , as a rough guide for ( 1 ) dosage and ( 2 ) possible toxicities .
Moreover , a logical consequence of another part of their complaint , namely that compounds that were found to be harmful in animals and therefore were not taken to clinical trials , is that we should test in humans therapies whose development stopped because of animal testing .
After all , if animals and humans are so different that the animal results must be viewed as meaningless , then how else would we identify potentially life saving drugs that were missed ?
Again , if we as medical scientists actually operated under the straw man assumption that the authors attack ( that animal models are such accurate predictors of human response ) , then we would n’t bother to do phase I clinical trials at all !
We could just test a new drug in animal models and then go straight to phase II trials of efficacy in humans .
Indeed ,
Niall et al are not only attacking a straw man argument here but dubiously conflating toxicity testing and the recommendations made from it .
Health policymakers , many of them unfortunately physicians , often err on the side of extreme caution when an animal experiment using even doses much higher than any human could ever encounter , shows that compound A causes cancer in mice , even as scientists point out the disconnect .
Another oddity is that the authors couch much of their arguments in evolutionary terms .
Indeed , they more or less claim that evolutionary considerations are why one absolutely can’t extrapolate responses in one animal to those of humans .
Consistent with this article , the website of Dr. Greek ’s group , there is a bold claim rejecting the contention that we should , as most scientists would advocate , apply the “ three Rs ” ( “ Reduce , Refine , and Replace ” ) to animal models :
Applying knowledge gained from animals to humans harms humans most of the time ( see A Critical Look at Animal Experimentation for many examples )
Intractable differences between species mean that animals cannot ‘ predict ’ how the human body will respond to a disease or a drug .
Their use violates the most fundamental principle of biology : evolution .
Therefore the ‘ animal model ’ paradigm should be rejected as unscientific .
And :
Science already has a wealth of superior ( not ‘ alternative ’ ! ) human - based methods at its disposal .
They are responsible for the medical care we enjoy today and are the only way to prevent , cure and treat human illness – yet many are starved of funds while animal experimentation is highly funded .
The animal experiment lobby maintains that animal experimentation is an expensive business – it is .
But it is not just costing society enormous sums of money , it is costing us far more in terms of human health .
The authors use these same arguments in a weaker form in their article for Skeptic , but not once do they show a concrete example illustrating how and why one of these methods is so “ superior ” to animal experiments–and by how much .
One would think , if these methods were so obviously superior and already available , that it would be child ’s play for the authors to spell out one or two specific examples in detail , with references from the peer - reviewed literature and concrete numbers , given how much verbiage they devoted to the deficiencies of animal testing .
( More on that later , ) As for evolutionary considerations , contrary to the fallacious arguments made by Niall et al , appeals to evolution do not tell us that animal models are useless , only whether one model is more likely to be useful than another .
There ’s a reason why there are no good mouse models of HIV in rodents , while there are useful , albeit imperfect , primate models ( some imperfections of which our always - intrepid critics of animal research point out gleefully in the article ) .
Some physiological mechanisms are more highly conserved across species than others , and some animal tumor models , such as lung carcinogenesis due to carcinogens from cigarette smoke , actually recapitulate the genetic changes observed in human tumors pretty well , suggesting common , evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of carcinogenesis , as do some rodent models of human colon cancer , where chemoprevention trials in special strains of mice and rats actually line up fairly well with human trials .
Although Niall et al correctly point out that modern medicine is moving towards personalized treatments based on gene expression profiles , we are not there yet .
In some cases the authors also appear to exaggerate just how bad the situation is , even when it comes to references that they themselves cite .
One example is a recent BMJ systematic review that –big surprise –found that animal models were good predictors for some conditions and poor predictors for others and was in fact more of a criticism of the quality of published animal studies than the utility of animal studies .
It concluded :
Systematic reviews can provide insights into the limitations of animal models .
For example , the animal models for stroke , where there was agreement with the results from clinical trials , seemed more representative of the condition in humans than the animal models for head injury , where there were differences in the results .
In stroke , the time from the occlusive event to the start of treatment was similar in animal and human studies .
In head injury , treatment was given within five minutes of injury in the animal models but up to eight hours after injury in the clinical trials .
None of the animal experiments used models that mimic the complex situations that usually follow traumatic head injury .
Comorbidities are clearly relevant in stroke , which occurs in older people with hypertension and diabetes but also in people with head injuries , often accompanied by other injuries and by hypotension and hypothermia .
Comorbidities were examined in the stroke models but not in the head injury models .
That there is a gap between clinical research and clinical practice is well established .
Our work highlights another gap — specifically the lack of communication between those involved in animal research and clinical trialists .
Systematic reviews of animal experiments could promote closer collaboration between the research communities and encourage an iterative approach to improving the relevance of animal models to clinical trial design .
When models do not represent the clinical context they could be adapted accordingly .
Furthermore , as is the case for human research , systematic reviews could help identify and improve deficiencies in the conduct and reporting of animal research .
In other words , according to this article animal models of stroke , for example , are actually pretty good at predicting human response to ischemic brain injury .
At the risk of injecting anecdotal evidence , I ’ll also point out that research using mouse tumor models that I did 10 years ago and that colleagues with whom I worked until 1999 did shortly after I left their laboratory showing that combining antiangiogenic therapy with either radiation or chemotherapy produces a synergistic antitumor effect has been validated in humans .
Indeed , that is now how antiangiogenic therapies are generally used , as combination therapy .
I could also point out a number of other reviews that find that animal models can be useful and predictive for cancer chemoprevention treatments , antibiotics , and neuroscience .
In rabbits , for instance , evidence for a preclinical effect of drugs against fungal infections can be translated into humans if toxicity and pharmacology can be optimized in humans .
In cancer , the use of mouse tumor models is more problematic in that single tumor models tend to have a fairly poor predictive value of human response .
However , results are much better when a panel of in vitro and in vivo tumor models are used .
The most pervasive problematic aspect of the Skeptic article ( and , indeed , all arguments of this type advanced by opponents of animal research ) is the utopian “ impossible dream ” fallacy coupled with differential standards , in which they demand standards of accuracy of animal research that are impractical or even unobtainable for nearly any disease model , while failing to make the case that the substitutes proposed will yield results at least as accurate and useful or preferably more so .
This is very much like the tactics of advocates of “ alternative medicine , ” who are prone to demanding a utopian standard of perfection for what they perceive to be “ conventional ” therapies while asserting without good evidence that their therapies are better or expecting us to accept their speculations that they are .
The authors of this Skeptic article do in essence the same thing , detailing the problems with animal models while making overblown claims for potential replacements .
For example , here is part of their section What Will We Use If We Don’t Experiment On Animals ? :
There are two answers to this question .
1 . If a test or research method does not accomplish the purpose for which it is used , it should be abandoned .
If testing drugs for liver toxicity in animals does not predict liver toxicity in humans , then the test is a waste of resources and , moreover , can be dangerous since the results cannot be counted on to reflect the human condition .
So , even if no other testing and research modalities existed , the animal model should still be abandoned .
By analogy , there is no cure for AIDS but ( hopefully ) we would not treat AIDS patients with trephination — drilling holes in the skull — even if trephination happened to be the only available procedure .
This argument sounds seductive on its surface but greatly exaggerates the lack of utility of animal testing .
Trephination is indeed utterly useless .
Even the worst description of animal testing as made by these authors does not render it the equivalent of trephination , and their comparing it to trephination is clearly a huge exaggeration .
The authors then propose a second answer :
2 . In the case of human medicine , there are myriad research and testing modalities that are scientifically productive .
Anything that is humanbased is , ipso facto , going to be more reliable than anything animal - based .
Examples include human embryonic stem cell research ; epidemiological studies of patterns of human disease and their associations with environmental causes ; in vitro research using human cells and tissues ; the use of gene chips or microarrays to study patterns of gene expression in humans ; clinical research ; autopsies ; mathematical and computer modeling ; post - marketing drug surveillance ; basic scientific research in the fields of biology , physics and chemistry ; and technology - based research methods such as those using positron emission tomography , functional magnetic resonance imaging , and others ; these are viable means for discovering truths about human disease and drugs .
Here ’s where the authors ’ double standard towards animal research starts to become obvious .
I note that in the several pages of prose leading up to this statement , the authors list and reference many , many problems with animal research .
They provide citations for these problems and , when possible , provide numbers for the poor predictive value of some animal models of some diseases .
Yet , when they describe their preferred models and tests , suddenly there is not a single reference to tell us how predictive these other methods are , not a single concrete number to show that these tests , or combinations thereof , can predict human response better than the animal models that the authors would like to see replaced by them .
Instead , we are told the authors ’ preferred methods are “ scientifically productive . ”
No kidding !
I would n’t argue with the contention that they can be scientifically productive ; what I ’d argue with is whether the authors ’ preferred methods can presently predict human responses better than our current tools that include animal research .
If they can ’t , then what the authors are proposing is that we throw out a useful ( albeit flawed ) tool ( animal studies ) in favor of either unproven techniques with a lot of promise that has not yet been realized ( genomics and proteomics , functional MRI ) , known methods that study human response after the fact , given that they are done after a drug is in release ( post - release surveillance , epidemiology ) , or methods that are clearly no better and probably worse at prediction than animal models ( cell culture and computer models ) , all of which are also being used in addition to animals anyway .
I would be more than happy to replace my animal tumor models with a combination of the above–when it can be shown that the above tests do an equivalent or better job of modeling human physiology , biochemistry , and pharmacology .
The authors fail to show that they can , preferring argument by assertion rather than by evidence .
Indeed , I ’m not sure that they can ever show that some aspects of whole - organ physiology can ever be modeled that way , but I ’ll never know because they did n’t try .
Yet such complexities do not disturb the authors of this article :
We agree that life processes are interdependent ; for example , the liver influences the heart , which in turn influences the brain , which in turn influences the kidneys and so on .
Thus , the response of an isolated heart cell to a medication does not confirm that the intact human heart will respond as predicted by the isolated heart cell .
The liver may metabolize a drug to a new chemical that is toxic to the heart whereas the original chemical was not toxic .
We also concede that cell cultures , computer modeling , in vitro research etc. , cannot replace the living intact system of a human being .
But while animal models may be intact systems , are they intact systems in ways that are causally relevant to human intact systems ?
Shifting the focus from genes , cells and tissues to intact animal systems does not evade the long reach of our concerns about causal disanalogy .
This , and their comment about how anything “ human - based is , ipso facto , going to be more reliable than anything animal - based ” also betrays their agenda .
( It also makes me wonder if they think that a study of cultured human cells would be superior in figuring out the effects of hemorrhagic shock on cardiac pumping capacity than the use of a well - designed animal model .
Hint :
It would be highly unlikely to . )
They seem to think that scientists use animal models because we do n’t realize that it would be better to do research whenever possible on human cells and human tissue .
The reason we do not is that most of the time it is neither practical nor ethical to do such research on humans , particularly research involving what we most want to know about these days , macroscopic responses to genetic and biochemical signals and changes .
Finally , let me show you an example of what I referred to earlier as the “ impossible dream ” fallacy , namely the impossible standard to which the authors demand that animal research be held :
We realize that our claims are controversial , but our arguments are straightforward .
If our arguments are unsound , they should be easy to refute .
Here is how : 1 . Explain why animals , when used as predictive models for the study of human disease and to test drugs , are not used as CAMs [ “ causal analogical models . ” ]
( Remember , we fully accept that animal studies can yield fruitful insights in the context of basic biological research .
If you want to know about rat biology , you must study rats .
The issue here is whether you can study humans in ways that are predictively efficacious by studying rats ) .
2 . Show that animal models , when used as CAMs , are successful far more often than not .
This can be accomplished by comparing the results of drug toxicity studies in animals with studies in humans or by comparing the results of induced diseases in animals with the same disease in humans .
The first one is more a game of semantics than any substantive criticism in that animals do n’t have to be “ causal analogical models ” to be useful to biological research or predictive enough of human responses to remain useful .
It is in essence defining the use of animals in such a way that one could never demonstrate sufficient accuracy to satisfy the authors , namely as a true predictive surrogate for human beings .
The second one , however , is the “ Bingo ! ” of double standards .
The authors demand that animal models must be successful predictors “ far more often than not , ” a standard to which they do not even try to hold their preferred methodologies or even claim that they can achieve .
Remember , epidemiology is prone to all sorts of confounding factors that make incorrect conclusions very easy , as we discuss quite frequently on this blog .
Do they honestly claim that epidemiological studies are accurate “ far more likely than not ” ?
Post - marketing surveillance is not predictive ; it is after the fact .
Genomic approaches , although promising , are very expensive ( although they are decreasing in cost ) .
They are also computationally intense , require many human tissue samples to produce statistically valid patterns that must then be validated as predictors , and require very sophisticated statistics and rigorous methodology , without which they are extremely prone to false positive results , something that occurred time and time again early on in such studies .
Finally , computer models , as sophisticated as they are becoming , are still too unreliable to trust as a primary modality for preclinical drug testing .
The authors give another indication of where they ’re coming from near the very end of the article .
First they crow about how none of their critics have been able to meet their intentionally impossible standards , while neglecting to recognize that they can’t meet their own standards , and then they bring out a dread accusation :
Thus far , we have not been able to find such data contradicting our arguments ; more importantly , none of our critics have been able to present this data either .
One hypothesis that explains this is that there are no such data .
Either no one has compiled it , or it simply does n’t exist .
We suspect that these are hypotheses worthy of further research .
Until such data can be found , analyzed , and interpreted we must tentatively conclude that the use of allegedly predictive animal models remains in vogue not for scientific reasons but for non-scientific reasons .
Those who have an interest in social policy being guided by science should demand that good science prevail and , thus , that society turn its attention to more fruitful methods of biomedical research .
Actually , we are trying to use methods that use fewer or no animals .
There is n’t a biomedical researcher alive that I ’m aware of who does n’t wish that there were another way to get the answers we seek .
Animal research is expensive , messy , labor - and time - intensive , and falling under increasingly onerous federal regulations .
As for the claim that animal models remain in vogue for non-scientific reasons , that ’s about as good a case of the pot calling the kettle black as I ’ve seen in a long time .
Here ’s why .
Most responsible animal researchers actually do subscribe to the “ 3 Rs ” mentioned earlier .
It ’s a reasonable strategy for minimizing the use of animals now while still using them to study diseases where they have relevance , all with the the long term goal of eventually rendering animal models unnecessary , particularly if we regulatory bodies approve only high quality studies .
Unfortunately , that reasonable strategy is not enough for the authors of this article , however , at least not for Dr. Greek as evidenced on his group ’s website .
He considers animal research to be so rotten and useless that it should be stopped now , even though he ca n’t show that there are other methods , whether they are “ alternatives ” or mainstream , that can do the job even as well as ( according to the article ) the poor standard animal research presently shows .
He comes to that conclusion through straw man arguments about how animals are actually used and defining the bar for success so high that few imaginable modalities could reach it while excusing his “ alternatives ” from the same bar .
His vision , if it came to pass , would be a disaster for biomedical research .
His arguments , as embodied in the Skeptic article , are the real pseudoscience .
When it comes down to it , opposition to animal research is almost always far more ideological than scientific in nature .
I purposely did not go into the moral issues involved with animal research because such issues depend very much upon the background and moral framework from which each of us proceeds .
Animal rights extremists , such as those described at the beginning of this post , tend to emphasize their moral objection to such research above all , or how they view animals as being equal to humans and deserving of the same rights .
That is how they justify their campaigns of harrassment and even violence against medical researchers .
Indeed , some of them argue that even in the hypothetical case in which animal research would definitely result in a cure for AIDS or cancer , they would still oppose it .
Other opponents of animal research , such as authors of the Skeptic article , differ from the extremists in that they are not violent , will acknowledge when pushed that animal research has produced useful scientific discoveries , and do not make arguments that animals are morally equal to humans or that we should therefore not eat them , experiment on them , or keep them as pets .
However , in their seeming reasonableness , their opposition to animal research is not , their claims otherwise notwithstanding , based any more on science than that of the animal rights extremists .
That they would apply such a double standard to animal research compared to their favored non-animal research modalities , coupled with their absolutist language and cherry picking of studies , show this quite conclusively .
Just remember , whenever you hear seemingly “ scientific ” arguments against animal research that emphasize how bad and inaccurate it is , ask for concrete examples from the peer - reviewed literature that show that non-animal modalities are consistently equal to or better than animal experiments to answer the question being asked .
You ’ll be hard - pressed to find them .
I have to come clean on regulation .
Contrary to assertions about " left - wing economists , " I am generally anti-regulation .
When markets approach competitive conditions , they work best when they are left alone .
Sometimes regulation and market intervention are needed to force markets into the competitive mold , at least approximately , but only when we are sure that the costs of market failure are sufficiently high to justify intervention .
The threshold for intervention is fairly high .
I think Greenspan is getting a bad rap when he is criticized for being anti-regulation with respect to financial markets .
Most of us were .
Well , maybe I should speak for myself - I was .
When you looked at the data and saw , for example , except for the S&L crisis , no or very few bank failures you wondered if there was enough competitive pressure in the industry .
In a few years there were literally no bank failures in all of the U.S .
At the time , it seemed like regulations such as those that prevented banks from paying interest on deposits above a set amount inhibited flexibility and helped contribute to disintermediation problems , and there were other regulations that also seemed to do more harm than good .
If someone had asked me at the time if I thought we needed more or less regulation in financial markets I would have said less , except for a qualification about capital requirements for bank owners so they are not playing with other people 's money with no stake of their own in the bet .
That 's a prescription for moral hazard and excessive risk taking .
But there was a general belief among economists that modern financial markets could handle more competition , and a movement toward deregulation .
Maybe other economists saw things differently , I 'll let them speak for themselves , but I have a hard time being critical of Greenspan as an individual on this particular point ( and , in general , he gets too much credit / blame as an individual anyway ) .
He was part of a deregulation wave , but he did n't start it .
There is the Gramlich episode ( Greenspan 's response ) , but Greenspan did n't ride roughshod over others who thought we ought to intervene with new regulation , or who thought we should step up enforcement of existing regulation .
Sure , he was a bit on the outer fringe in terms of the degree to which he believed in these ideas , not all of us were completely anti-regulation , but for he most part the general attitude was that we needed to deregulate whenever and wherever we could , and it's my impression that most economists supported this view , even those who are known to be " left - leaning . "
My biggest complaint in the past was that we were failing to rein in market power , that 's where I thought the regulators were falling down , by allowing too much monopoly power in certain sectors ( I still think that ) .
I believe regulators should intervene with new regulations or lift old regulations as needed to approximate competitive conditions - the goal of regulation is to make markets work better - but I can't say that I was worried about deregulation somehow leading to a market meltdown of the type we have seen recently ( with respect to the present crisis , the problem was more the failure to enforce existing regulations or to impose new ones rather than deregulation ) .
Monopoly power was my main worry .
Most markets do n't collapse like this - they are self - regulating and can be left alone ( and if they do collapse , the entire economy is not threatened ) - but financial markets are different and that 's something I wo n't forget again .
I 'm still not sure exactly how to prevent the build - up of common risk to the point where the entire financial sector and greater economy are vulnerable to a bad outcome , capital requirements , transparency , and better ratings agencies are a start , as is reducing the concentration of market power , but using regulation to prevent the possibility of systemic breakdown in the financial sector is something that demands more attention , and something I hope I - or we - do n't overlook again .
There are good ideas out there , and hopefully we can find a way to reduce our vulnerability to the problems associated with widespread failure in financial markets .
THIS poor country keeps taking one blow after another , " Peter Goossens observed two months ago in an interview with The New York Times ' Jeffrey Gettleman .
" Ultimately , it will break . "
The country is Somalia , and Goossens directs the World Food Programme , which is now feeding some 1.2 million people there , 15 per cent of the population .
This tragic and tortured land is " marching right up to the edge of a crisis " , Goossens said .
" Any additional little thing , any little flood or drought , will push them over . "
Somalia , war - and famine - torn , is beset from within and without .
With a vigilance especially stepped up since September 11 , the United States has reformulated its long - standing efforts to control the Horn of Africa ( Djibouti , Ethiopia , Eritrea and Somalia ) as a front line in the " war on terror " , and Somalia is at its very tip .
The crisis in Somalia may be regarded partly as collateral damage from that " war on terror " and the geopolitical concerns reframed in these terms .
As Somalia sinks deeper into chaos , members of the African Union have sent small peacekeeping forces there , and pledged to send more if funding is made available .
But they are unlikely to do so , " because there is no peace to keep ( in Somalia ) in the first place , " Richard Cornwell , of the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa , told Scott Baldauf and Alexis Okeowo of The Christian Science Monitor in May .
By November , the United Nations noted that Somalia had " higher malnutrition rates , more current bloodshed and fewer aid workers than Darfur , " Gettleman reported .
Indeed , Ahmedou Ould - Abdallah , the top UN official for Somalia , described its plight as " the worst on the continent " .
The United Nations , however , lacks the capacity to reach the people who are hungry , exposed , sick and dying in Somalia , according to Eric Laroche , head of UN humanitarian operations there .
" If this were happening in Darfur , there would be a big fuss , " Laroche said .
" But Somalia has been a forgotten emergency for years . "
One distinction , hard to miss , is that the tragedy of Darfur can be blamed on someone else , in fact an official enemy — the government of Sudan and its Arab militias — while responsibility for the current disaster in Somalia , like others there that preceded it , lies substantially in our own hands .
In 1992 , after the overthrow of the Somali dictatorship by clan - based militias and the ensuing famine , the United States sent thousands of soldiers on a dubious " rescue mission " to assist with humanitarian operations .
But in October 1993 , during the " Battle of Mogadishu " , two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down by Somali militiamen , leaving 18 US Army Rangers dead , along with perhaps 1,000 Somalis .
US forces were immediately withdrawn in a manner that continued the murderous ratio .
" In the final stages of the troops ' retreat , every bullet fired against them was answered , it seemed , by 100 , " Los Angeles Times correspondent John Balzar reported .
As for the Somali casualties , Marine Lt. Gen. Anthony Zinni , who commanded the operation , informed the Press that " I 'm not counting bodies ... I 'm not interested . "
CIA officials privately conceded that during the US operations in Somalia , in which 34 US soldiers were lost , Somali casualties — militiamen and civilians — may have been 7,000 to 10,000 , Charles William Maynes reported in Foreign Policy .
The " rescue mission " , which may have killed about as many Somalis as it saved , left the country in the hands of brutal warlords .
" After that , the United States — and much of the rest of the world — basically turned its back on Somalia , " Gettleman reports .
" But in the summer of 2006 , the world started paying attention again after a grass - roots Islamist movement emerged from the clan chaos and seized control of much of the country " , leaving only an enclave adjoining Ethiopia in the hands of the Western - recognised Transitional Federal Government .
During their brief tenure , the Islamists " did n't cause us any problems " , Laroche reports .
Ould - Abdallah called the six months of their rule Somalia 's " golden era " , the only period of peace in Somalia for years .
Other UN officials concur , observing that " the country was in better shape during the brief reign of Somalia 's Islamist movement last year " than it has been since Ethiopia invaded in December 2006 to impose the rule of the TFG .
The Ethiopian invasion , with US backing and direct participation , took place immediately after the U.N. Security Council , at U.S. initiative , passed Resolution 1725 for Somalia , which called upon all states " to refrain from action that could provoke or perpetuate violence and violations of human rights , contribute to unnecessary tension and mistrust , endanger the ceasefire and political process , or further damage the humanitarian situation . "
The invasion by Somalia 's historical enemy , Christian Ethiopia , soon elicited a bitter resistance , leading to the present crisis .
The official reason for US participation in Ethiopia 's overthrow of the Islamist regime is the " war on terror " — which itself has engendered terror , quite apart from its own atrocities .
Furthermore , the roots of the Islamic fundamentalist regime trace back to earlier stages of the " war on terror " .
Immediately after September 11 , the United States spearheaded an international effort to close down Al - Barakaat — a Dubai - based Somali remittance network that also runs major businesses in Somalia — on grounds that it was financing terror .
This move was hailed by government and media as one of the great successes of the " war on terror " .
In contrast , Washington 's withdrawal of its charges as without merit a year later aroused little interest .
The greatest impact of the closing of Al - Barakaat was in Somalia .
According to the United Nations , in 2001 the enterprise was responsible for about half the $ 500 million remittances to Somalia , " more than it earns from any other economic sector and 10 times the amount of foreign aid ( Somalia ) receives " .
Al - Barakat also played a major role in the economy , Ibrahim Warde observes in " The Price of Fear " , his devastating study of Bush 's " financial war on terror " .
The frivolous attack on a very fragile society " may have played a role in the rise ... of Islamic fundamentalists , " Warde concludes — another familiar consequence of the " war on terror " .
The renewed torture of Somalia falls within the context of US efforts to gain firm control over the Horn of Africa , where the United States is launching a new Africa command and extending naval operations in crucial shipping lanes , part of the broader campaign to ensure its domination of the world 's primary energy resources in the Gulf region and in Africa as well .
Just after World War II , when State Department planners were assigning each part of the world its " function " within the overall system of US domination , Africa was considered unimportant .
George Kennan , head of the State Department 's Policy Planning Staff , advised that Africa should be handed over to Europe to " exploit " for its reconstruction .
No longer .
The resources of Africa are too valuable to be left to others , particularly with China extending its commercial reach .
If poor Somalia collapses in starvation and misery , that is merely a sideshow of grand geopolitical designs , and of little moment .

( CNN ) -- Retail chain Sam's Club will limit the sale of large quantities of rice amid a dramatic increase in the global price of rice .
The store will limit customers to four 20 - lb. bags of jasmine , basmati and long - grain white rice , the company said in a statement .
Its restriction mainly will affect businesses that buy rice in bulk , but the company said " a typical Sam 's Club Business Member does not buy more than 80 pounds of rice in one visit . "
" We currently have plenty of rice for Sam 's Club members , " the statement said .
" This temporary restriction does not apply to retail - sized rice for sale in Sam's or elsewhere at Wal - Mart stores . "
The restriction does not apply in Idaho and New Mexico .

When it comes to technology , it 's the great unfulfilled needs that matter most .
That 's where the next fortunes will be made .
But if you 're in the tech biz , how do you know what users want if you 're hanging out with techies all the time ?
You turn to sex .
Here are seven reasons why your tech company should send you to sex conferences like Sex 2.0 , Arse Elektronica and Sex in Video Games rather than to mainstream events like this week 's Web 2.0 Expo .
1 . You 'll learn what people do with tech in private .
Even if your company springs for usability testing and focus groups , people are n't going to admit what they do when they think no one 's watching .
My friend who put an extra monitor in her office so she could dedicate one screen just to Facebook is n't going to reveal at a technology summit what she does with it at night .
At a sex conference , however , that personal information can become a bona fide user case study .
2 . Tech adapted for sex has applications outside the bedroom .
A tech conference exposes you to ideas people have already had .
A sex conference exposes you to people who are n't afraid to ask for what they want , no matter how technically improbable it seems .
You can use your tech - savvy brain to adapt these desires for general usage and present them to your boss .
Meanwhile , you can create a sex-specific application on the side , knowing you have a willing user base waiting breathlessly for your next release .
3. Social - media platforms are built for sex .
If an application becomes crucial to lovers , they will have no problem coming up with genuine reasons to integrate that tool into their work flow .
And once corporate users are on board , the paper millions are just an IPO away .
4 . Young people – your future customers – do it with tech .
There 's money in bridging old - school romance with new media , and the sex - positive community knows how to make that leap better than anyone .
When today 's youth get out of school , they 're going to remake the world the way they want it – and that means tech will be an essential ingredient in courtship , romance and sex .
It 's so essential to young people 's communication now that they do n't even realize they 're doing it .
And this is at a time when they 're still spending most of their time surrounded by their peers .
Just wait until they 're out of school and in the workforce .
5 . Sex bloggers reveal more than other people .
A lot more .
Users in focus groups do n't always possess the communication skills to get their true messages across .
They also do n't know what they do n't know .
Sex bloggers , on the other hand , are happy to communicate their needs , in minute detail , to someone they believe can satisfy them .
Buy them a drink after - hours and you 're in for something more fulfilling than the most comprehensive requirements - gathering meeting ever .
6 . Sex conferences are tech conferences .
Until recently , sex conventions fell into two basic categories : medicinal / clinical and pornographic .
Now , social - media pioneers are creating smaller , targeted gatherings that treat sexuality and technology as inseparable .
Five years from now , this wo n't be shocking .
And the gatherings wo n't be that small , either .
Not that size matters .
7 . Sex conferences happen in 3 - D fantasy worlds made manifest .
Many of the most exciting exchanges happen after - hours at tech conferences .
But more and more , organizers are holding serious sex - tech conferences in adults - only venues like swinger clubs and BDSM playgrounds .
Observing how people interact professionally and personally in these spaces gives rise to many ideas for making your virtual environment stickier .
Virtual world entrepreneurs know that whiz - bang wares can bring people in , but only relationships can entice them to come regularly .
Bonus reason :
You might have a sexual experience of your own .
Granted , this reason is n't likely to go over well if you include it on the list of why your boss should approve your trip to a sex expo .
While people who go to sex conferences can't be written off as a bunch of perverts who invent tax - deductible reasons to get together for wild orgies , we all know that going too long without a loving touch is a drag .
It makes us too irritable , tense and depressed to perform our best on the job .
Is n't that the major criticism of tech - mediated relationships , high - tech jobs and constant connectivity – that we lose touch ?
Personal interaction is key to building a Web 3.0 we can all be proud of .
See you at the next sex conference ,

AWJA , Iraq ( Reuters ) - Hundreds of Iraqi schoolchildren were brought to the modest mausoleum of Saddam Hussein on Monday to celebrate the birthday of the executed dictator in the village where he was born .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Saddam , who was hanged in late 2006 for crimes against humanity , is hated in much of Iraq .
But in parts of his native Salahuddin Province , especially among his fellow Sunni Arabs , he is still revered .
“ Bush , Bush you low - life !
Saddam ’s blood is not cheap ! ” a crowd of pupils in white uniforms from a nearby girls ’ school chanted while standing around Saddam ’s grave in the mausoleum where he is buried among displays and photos of his reign .
“ There are two things we will never give up : Saddam and Iraq ! ” the girls chanted .
Several of them wept .
They entered the building carrying a banner which read : “ We will not forget you , Papa Saddam , ” and kissed the dictator ’s grave .
“ There is no martyr like Saddam .
We are here to celebrate his birthday .
Happy birthday , and God willing he will go to paradise , ” a girl named Tiba , 11 , told Reuters .
Faten Abdel Qader , one of the organizers , said Saddam ’s legacy was the memory of a time of peace .
“ The children who lived during the age of this man had security .
They did n’t know anything about murder , violence or sectarianism , ” she said .
“ An Iraqi woman could hold her head high . ”
Saddam , who was born in Awja on April 28 , 1937 , was executed for his role in the deaths of Shi’ite villagers slain after an assassination attempt on him .
At the time of his execution he was also standing trial for genocide for the killing of hundreds of thousands of Kurds .
Iraq ’s government says he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of others buried in mass graves during decades of oppression .
His supporters say his harsh rule prevented the sectarian killing that has been rampant since he was ousted in the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .

On October 8 , 2007 , the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati granted the government 's request for a full - panel hearing in United States v. Warshak case centering on the right of privacy for stored electronic communications .
At issue is whether the procedure whereby the government can subpoena stored copies of your email - similar to the way they could simply subpoena any physical mail sitting on your desk - is unconstitutionally broad .
This appears to be more than a mere argument in support of the constitutionality of a Congressional email privacy and access scheme .
It represents what may be the fundamental governmental position on Constitutional email and electronic privacy - that there is n't any .
What is important in this case is not the ultimate resolution of that narrow issue , but the position that the United States government is taking on the entire issue of electronic privacy .
That position , if accepted , may mean that the government can read anybody 's email at any time without a warrant .
What is Privacy ?
In a seminal case ( Katz v. United States in 1963 ) the US Supreme Court , over the strenuous objections of the US government , upheld the right of the user of a payphone to claim a right to privacy in the contents of those communications .
The Court held that the Fourth Amendment right to be secure in your " persons , house , places and effects " against unreasonable searches and seizures protected people , not just places .
Thus , to determine whether you had a right against unreasonable seizure - a kind of privacy right - the court adopted a two - pronged test : did you think what you were doing was private and is society willing to accept your belief as objectively reasonable ?
The method you use to communicate can effect both your subjective expectation of privacy and society 's willingness to consider that expectation as " reasonable . "
Shouting a " private " conversation into a megaphone at Times Square would neither be subjectively nor objectively reasonable , if you wanted the conversation to be confidential .
" Broadcasting " the conversation over the radio is likewise unreasonable .
But , what about " broadcasting " it over an unsecured Wi -Fi router , analog cell phone , or cordless telephone ?
While certain statutes may make the interception of such communications unlawful , absent such statutes is there a Constitutional prohibition on listening in ?
Put more narrowly , if the cops listen in on your baby monitor , do they violate your " right to privacy , " or do you give up your right by knowingly putting the monitor in little Timmy 's room in the first place ?
Partial Waiver
Do you have a " reasonable expectation of privacy " in the contents of email you send and receive at work , using a work computer , over a company supplied network , where the company has a " business use only " policy , and an employee monitoring policy that states that any communications may be monitored ?
Think about it .
Indeed , the policy will go further and says " users have no expectation of privacy . "
But is this true ?
Or , is it even a good idea ?
Remember Katz ?
The Constitution only protects reasonable expectations of privacy .
If you have no reasonable expectation of privacy in your email , then the examination of the contents of your email by anyone for any purposes is not an invasion of privacy and raises no Fourth Amendment concerns .
What you really mean in your policy is that your employer ( your supervisor , the IT staff , HR , legal , etc. ) may examine the contents of your e-mail for legitimate reasons and if they choose to , disclose the contents to whatever third parties they deem reasonable .
Fair enough .
But , it also means that you can't read your bosses ' email or your co-workers ' email , just because you are curious .
Why not ?
Because they have an " expectation of privacy " in their email .
Privacy is not like virginity - you either have it or you do n't .
You can have privacy rights with respect to some uses by some people and not with respect to other uses by other people .
Right ?
Well , not according to the government .
And the New Six - Word Motto for the U.S. Is …
Last week , we asked for your vote to decide the best of the top five entries to our “ 6 - word motto for the U.S. ” contest .
As promised , we tallied the votes received in the first 48 hours after posting .
There was a clear winner :
Our Worst Critics Prefer to Stay ( 194 votes )
Here are the runners - up :
Caution !
Experiment in Progress Since 1776 ( 134 ) The Most Gentle Empire So Far ( 64 ) votes You Should See the Other Guy ( 38 ) Just Like Canada , With Better Bacon ( 18 )
I applaud your choice of winner , and I especially applaud “ edholston , ” the blog reader who wrote the motto .
“ Our Worst Critics Prefer to Stay ” is , while perhaps not outrightly uplifting , a wonderfully concise acknowledgment of the paradox that a capitalist democracy inevitably is : a place that is often well worth complaining about , and which allows you to complain as loudly as you wish .
It seems a small reward to get just a piece of Freakonomics schwag for such a mighty task as writing a new motto for the United States , but that is all we have to offer .
That , and our thanks — to Ed , and to all of you who participated .
Now , who among you can see about actually getting this motto adopted ?

Trivia Tidbit Of The Day : Part 462 -- Worldwide Tax Trends .
Wrong Way On A One Way Track -
The world , looking to the American economic juggernaut for guidance , is becoming more like us with each passing day .
Some countries have even become more like the United States than -- well -- the United States itself .
Take the past 15 years or so of tax policy changes in the OECD , for example .
Art Laffer has the data ( .pdf ) :
What this tells us is that " the world " ( the part we compete against , at any rate ) is dropping its tax rates in most major categories in order to become more competitive .
In some categories , the OECD average is actually lower than the United States average .
Ruh , roh .
It seems fairly obvious that we had better watch these changes closely and be prepared to act to keep our country 's various competitive tax advantages intact .
Oops .
We just recently put Charlie Rangel in charge of taxes , so not only are we not poised to become more competitive , we 're poised to help our competitors .
For example , as Kevin Hassett calculated :
Since Rangel 's tax hikes are focused on the rich , and the AMT is scheduled to draw ever more revenue from the middle class in federal budget estimates , the rate increases necessary to maintain current revenue levels are enormous .
Rangel adds a 4.6 percent " surtax " on adjusted gross incomes above $ 500,000 in the first year of the law .
This gives voters the impression that we are simply lifting the current top rate of 35 percent to the good old Clinton rate of 39.6 percent .
But in 2011 , when the Bush tax cuts expire , the surtax sticks , lifting the federal rate to 44.2 percent .
Rangel also grabs revenue from the rich by phasing out exemptions and deductions .
Add in the Medicare tax , and average state and local taxes , and the combined marginal income tax rate goes to 52 percent .
As the accompanying chart illustrates , that would make our top marginal rate the second highest among the ten largest OECD economies , right below France .
Sorry , Charlie , but that 's just the wrong direction for America .
Additionally , odds are , under Rangel 's plan , after a brief flurry of higher tax revenues , we 'll actually lose tax revenue over the medium - to - long term , leading to additional tax hikes in the future .
More importantly , we 'll see lower economic growth relative to what we 've seen in recent years , lower economic growth relative to other countries , and a lower future standard of living .
Knowingly harming America 's future median and mean standards of living for the sake of greater " equality " is anything but virtuous .
And it 's anything but a recipe for political success .
One can only hope that all the various disgruntled members of the Republican coalition who sat out or defected in 2006 get wise to what is at stake here .

Luke Rudkowski of We Are Change caught up with President Jimmy Carter today at a Barnes & Noble bookstore located in Manhattan .
After Rudkowski referenced Operation Ajax and the CIA orchestrated overthrow of Mohammed Mosaddeq in Iran in 1953 via staged terror attacks , he asked Carter if he feared a staged - provocation for war with Iran .
Carter responded , “ No , I do n’t think lately that war is as likely as it was six months ago , ” adding , “ I hope not . ”
This is an important admission on the part of a former president , a trilateralist and government insider , and serves as further evidence the neocons may indeed attack Iran , as promised , before Bush leaves office .
Gary Talis , of We Are Change , then asked the former president if he believed there should be a new investigation into the collapse of WTC Building 7 on the afternoon of 9/11 .
Carter replied , “ Yes , it sounds good . ”
Rudkowski then asked Carter about Afghanistan and the Taliban .
Carter said issuing a directive secretly aiding the Taliban in 1979 was “ a very important thing for me to do ” in order to counter the Soviets .
Carter went on to describe the CIA organized and Saudi and Egyptian funded Mujahideen group as “ freedom fighters . ”
Eventually a faction of the Mujahideen would break away and become al - Qaeda , another CIA contrivance put to use in the Balkans as well as Afghanistan .
In fact , as Zbigniew Brzezinski , Carter ’s former national security adviser ( and high ranking trilateralist under aegis of David Rockefeller ) told France ’s Le Nouvel Observateur in January , 1998 , this aid “ was going to induce a Soviet military intervention ” in support of the pro-Soviet government in Kabul .
“ We did n’t push the Russians to intervene , but we knowingly increased the probability that they would . ”
Brzezinski’s “ secret operation was an excellent idea … it had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap … [ and ] giving to the USSR its Vietnam war . ”
Brzezinski also warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the risk that a false - flag event could be used to kickstart a war with Iran in February of 2007 .
We Are Change confronted the former National Security Adviser on two separate occasions to probe the meaning of his warning and to discuss the theoretical provocation ’s similarity to 9/11 , which launched two wars in the middle east and was blamed on a radical group that Brzezinksi himself had helped to found during the Carter Administration .
In the first instance , Rudkowski was told to ‘ sit down and shut up ’ before being removed for his question .
The second time , a large group of We Are Change members asked questions during an event at Columbia and were ridiculed again and again by Brzezinski .

Aaron Klein , original author of the piece at the World Net Dailly , emailed me this morning to say :
I never state anywhere he [ Obama ] funded any Palestinian terrorist or even worked with one .
This is good news and largely debunks the myth itself .
Klein makes clear he never claimed Khalidi is or was a terrorist .
This is also good news to me , because his original article is ambiguous on this score .
Klein then asked me to change the headline of this diary .
I declined to do this , because I have received emails , citing Klein 's story , that claim Obama funded Palestinian terrorism .
Taking Klein at his word that this allegation was not his intent , we easily debunk the myth in those emails .
So you can tell your right - wing family , friends , and colleagues that Aaron Klein -- the very author of the piece they are circulating so widely -- categorically rejects the assertion that Obama funded a Palestinian terrorist organization or even worked with one .
I now proceed to debunk Klein 's specific accusation in his subtitle :
Klein 's accusation is entitled
Obama worked with terrorist
Senator helped fund organization that rejects ' racist ' Israel 's existence .
The " terrorist " in the main title referred to by Klein is Ayers of the Weathermen .
( That is not the focus of this diary since others have addressed this aspect already in other dailykos diaries . )
I want to focus on the provocative subtitle : " Senator helped fund organization that rejects ' racist ' Israel 's existence . "
Quick easy debunking : nowhere in the text of the incendiary World Net Daily article does Klein present evidence that AAAN , the funded organization , " rejects Israel 's existence . "
The article merely claims that AAAN 's founder , Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi , publicly called Israel " racist . "
So did Obama , even if he did n't fund terrorism , help fund the goal of " rejecting Israel 's existence " ?
Or of calling Israel " racist " ?
I quote at length the beginning and a few paragraphs from a very long article :
The board of a nonprofit organization on which Sen. Barack Obama served as a paid director alongside a confessed domestic terrorist [ Ayers ] granted funding to a controversial Arab group that mourns the establishment of Israel as a " catastrophe " ...
The co-founder of the Arab group in question , Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi , also has held a fundraiser for Obama .
Khalidi is a harsh critic of Israel , has made statements supportive of Palestinian terror and reportedly has worked on behalf of the Palestine Liberation Organization while it was involved in anti-Western terrorism and was labeled by the State Department as a terror group .
In 2001 , the Woods Fund , a Chicago - based nonprofit that describes itself as a group helping the disadvantaged , provided a $ 40,000 grant to the Arab American Action Network , or AAAN , for which Khalidi's wife , Mona , serves as president .
The Fund provided a second grant to the AAAN for $ 35,000 in 2002 .
....
The AAAN , headquartered in the heart of Chicago 's Palestinian immigrant community , describes itself as working to " empower Chicago - area Arab immigrants and Arab Americans through the combined strategies of community organizing , advocacy , education and social services , leadership development , and forging productive relationships with other communities . "
....
Speakers at AAAN dinners and events routinely have taken an anti-Israel line .
The group co-sponsored a Palestinian art exhibit , titled , " The Subject of Palestine , " that featured works related to what some Palestinians call the " Nakba " or " catastrophe " of Israel 's founding in 1948 .
According to the widely discredited Nakba narrative , Jews in 1948 forcibly expelled hundreds of thousands - some Palestinians claim over one million - Arabs from their homes and then took over the territory .
I looked at the grants from the Woods Fund in their Annual Report for 2001 :
This is their mission statement from that document :
" Woods Fund of Chicago is a grantmaking foundation
whose goal is to increase opportunities for less advantaged
people and communities in the metropolitan area , including
the opportunity to shape decisions affecting them .
The foundation works primarily as a funding partner with
nonprofit organizations .
Woods supports nonprofits in their
important roles of engaging people in civic life , addressing
the causes of poverty and other challenges facing the region ,
promoting more effective public policies , reducing racism
and other barriers to equal opportunity , and building
a sense of community and common ground "
The letter of the President that year ( page 8 ) was titled
" INCREASING THE PARTICIPATION OF THE LESS ADVANTAGED IN PUBLIC POLICY "
Here 's the grant on page 21 :
" ARAB AMERICAN ACTION NETWORK
Toward the salary of a community organizer in a new initiative to develop
leadership capacities of Arab youth and women on Chicago ’s southwest side 40,000 "
The grant in 2002 , was similar :
" ARAB AMERICAN ACTION NETWORK
First installment of a two - year grant for a neighborhood - based community organizing project on Chicago ’s southwest side targeted at developing the leadership capacity of Arab youth and women 35,000 "
Page 30 of 2002 Annual Report
These annual grants were one of more than a hundred grants given each year and about 1 % of the funds granted .
Whether Obama sincerely scrutinized every individual in every organization involved in more than a hundred grants each year and should be personally responsible for the statements of what every speaker said at each organization 's dinners and events , is , I think , a stretch .
I also do n't think Obama should be responsible for the content of all of the works of art of an art exhibit sponsored by the organization merely because he was on the board of directors of an institution that gave that organization a grant for community development .
Remember the grant was for the salary of a community organizer to develop leadership capacities of Arab youth in disadvantaged southwest Chicago .
And unless you think that Arabs in America should never be eligible for grants , I 'm not sure I see what the concern is .
I do see why a right - wing hit machine would want to hype this though .
And the argument is , because that organization was founded by a Palestinian Arab who has typical ( and I would argue , wrong - headed ) Palestinian Arab views , that Obama is a closet Palestinian terrorist sympathizer .
So what about Rashid Khalidi ?
Was he a member of the terrorist Palestinian Liberation Organization ?
Not directly , according to Israel .
We know this because he served on the 1991 " guidance committee " at the Madrid Conference where Israel refused to negotiate with anyone directly associated with the terrorist organization but did negotiate with people " in communication with " the PLO .
In other words , Khalidi was considered non-violent and non-terrorist enough for Israel to sit down at a negotiating table with him .
Israel has a strict policy of not negotiating with terrorists who deny its right to exist .
Yet Israel sat down with Khalidi in 1991 , ten years before the Woods Funds gave the organization Khalidi co-founded a grant to build the leadership skills of local disadvantaged Arab youth .
Let me be clear : I have no doubt that Khalidi sympathizes with a pro-Palestinian agenda and even apparently considers violence against Israeli soldiers " legitimate under international law " ( although he has condemned violence against Israeli civilians ) .
As I am strongly pro-Israel and support Israel 's right to exist within secure boundaries free of violence , this concerns me .
I 'm reminded that Israel has only taken territory in defensive wars and that when it removes itself from occupation ( as it did recently in Gaza ) , missiles rain down on innocent civilians in its borders .
I am fully aware that Israel 's security fence , checkpoints , and military occupation are necessities to protect its citizens from mass murder and that Israel will withdraw from the vast majority of the West Bank ( as it did in Gaza ) the instant it is granted a right to exist in peace .
In fact , I 'm confident that Obama shares my pro-Israel views on this , as evidenced by his recent letter to our Ambassador to the United Nations on the situation in Gaza ( emphasis mine ) :
January 22,2008 Dear Ambassador Khalilzad : I understand that today the U.N. Security Council met regarding the situationn in Gaza , and that a resolution or statement could be forthcoming from the Council in short order .
I urge you to ensure that the Security Council issue no statement and pass no resolution in this matter that does not fully condemn the rocket assault Hamas has been conducting on civilians in southern Israel for over two years .
All of us are concerned about the impact of closed border crossings on Palestinian families .
However we have to understand why Israel is forced to do this .
Gaza is governed by Hamas , which is a terrorist organization sworn to Israel 's destruction , and Israeli civilians are being bombarded by rockets on an almost daily basis .
That is unacceptable and Israel has a right to respond while seeking to minimize any impact on civilians .
The Security Council should clearly and unequivocally condemn the rocket attacks against Israel , and should make clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against such actions .
If it can not bring itself to make these common sense points , I urge you to ensure that it does not speak at all .
Sincerely . [ signed ]
Barack Obama
United States Senator
Not that Obama agrees with every decision of the Israeli Government ( nor do I ) , but I believe he understands that Israel , like all nations of the world , has the international legal right to self - defense against those actively bringing war to destroy it ( such as Gaza under Hamas ) .
I think to hold Obama accountable for Khalidi 's views is far - fetched .
Obama sat on a board that gave one of more than a hundred grants for two years to an organization to pay for the salary of a community organizer " in a new initiative to develop leadership capacities of Arab youth and women on Chicago ’s southwest side . "
That organization was founded by a man with typical , though reprehensible , Palestinian Arab views .
( Actually , the more I read about Khalidi the more I would argue that his views are less reprehensible than many Arab intellectuals , many of whom DO advocate violence against innocent civilians .
Thanks to klizard for pointing this out to me . )
Klein argues at World Net Daily that Khalidi once held a fundraiser for Obama and therefore Obama can be held accountable for his views .
I think to link Obama with Khalidi is as much of a stretch as linking him with Farrakhan , as was discussed at the recent Obama / Clinton MSNBC debate .
It 's the imputing of another man 's views to Obama by a quite tenuous connection to him .
There is no evidence that Obama ever did anything to fund the " rejection of Israel 's existence " or to declare Israel " racist . "
Think of it this way .
Let 's say McCain was on the board of a charity that gave funds to hundreds of organizations .
One organization was " toward the salary of a community organizer in a new initiative to develop leadership capacities of pro-life youth in Phoenix Arizona . "
Now let 's say that that organization was run by the wife of a man at Operation Rescue , an organization that advocates bombing abortion clinics .
Should McCain then be considered a terrorist ?
Or unworthy of being President ?
Mass deportations coming for jailed illegal immigrants
The U.S. Homeland Security department has launched an ambitious nationwide effort that would cost $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion a year to identify and deport the estimated 300,000 to 450,000 illegal immigrants locked up each year in jails and prisons .
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation was denounced by immigrant rights groups and received cautiously by those favoring tighter enforcement .
'' We can do something few law enforcement agencies can do :
Not only ensure criminals are off the streets , but ensure they are removed from the country , " said ICE spokesman Tim Counts .
'' Removing hundreds of thousands of criminals from the country is sure to have a positive impact on community safety . "
ICE has a presence in only 10 percent of the nation 's 3,100 local lockups .
Last year , it filed deportation charges against 164,000 illegal immigrants in jail , and removed 95,000 , Counts said .
'' It 's a broad - stroke outline for a plan to locate more of the illegal aliens located in jails and prisons throughout the country , " Counts said .
The recently announced ICE effort , known as " Secure Communities , " will upgrade computer technology in jails and allow local jailers to access ICE 's fingerprint database to quickly identify prisoners with immigration violations as they are booked .
The $ 200 million in funding already allocated for the program this year would also add an unspecified number of ICE detention and removal officers , Counts confirmed .
The program would also :
• Prioritize removal of criminal immigrants based on their danger to the community .
• Expand an early parole program for non-violent immigrants who agree to deportation .
• Add staff in field offices so ICE detention officers are available around - the - clock to assist local jailers in deportation .
• Increase the 287 ( g ) program , which trains state and local law enforcement officers to perform immigration duties .
Counts said the first priority would be removing " level one " immigrants , those convicted of major drug offenses and violent crimes including murder , manslaughter , rape and armed robbery .
Removing those offenders would cost around $ 1 billion a year .
ICE estimates the cost to remove all convicted criminal immigrants in custody would be $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion annually .
" We estimate it will take approximately three and a half years to remove all level one criminal aliens , and to test the program 's effectiveness , " Counts said .
Sheriff 's office interested
Harris County sheriff 's officials , who are awaiting approval for ICE training for a dozen jail deputies , said they would be interested in access to the ICE database .
'' I would assume that as the nature of our relationship with ICE expands , it would be made available to us , " said Maj .
Don McWilliams , commander of the department 's public services bureau .
'' As we get our people trained to assist ICE , we certainly would like access to any and all databases ICE has access to . "
The Secure Communities initiative expands ICE 's Criminal Alien Program , which focuses on identifying deportable immigrants incarcerated in federal , state and local facilities .
The Harris County Sheriff 's Office participates in the program by asking county jail inmates if they are in the country legally .
Jail officials then refer illegal immigrants to ICE , which can place detainers on them to prevent their release and subject them to deportation .
The same program ignited protests last year in Irving , the Dallas suburb where ICE agents worked closely with city jailers to deport hundreds of illegal immigrants .
Activists there complained Irving police were targeting immigrants in raids .
Fire from both sides
The new multiyear ICE operation has raised questions from groups on both sides of the immigration debate .
Curtis Collier , president of the U.S. Border Watch in Houston , said illegal immigrants should only be deported after completing their sentences .
'' Deportation is not punishment .
We are adamantly opposed to removing people prior to their serving their sentence , because it 's basically early release , " Collier said .
'' And once they deport them , they 'll be right back in this country . "
Arnoldo Garcia , program coordinator for the National Network of Immigrant Refugee Rights , said the ICE effort could result in profiling of immigrants .
'' They 're wasting resources , " said Garcia , whose group is based in California .
'' And how are they going to verify the rights of those individuals who are jailed ? "

NEW YORK ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
What will likely be the final debate of the Democratic primary cycle worked wonders for MSNBC , giving it the news channel ’s highest ratings ever .
More than 7.8 million viewers tuned in to the sometimes caustic debate between Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama , according to data released Wednesday afternoon by Nielsen Media Research .
It ranked as the third - most - watched debate this election season , behind only ABC ’s Democratic presidential debate on the eve of the New Hampshire presidential primary in January and CNN ’s Kodak Theatre showdown this month .
It was far above anything else in MSNBC ’s 11 - year history , surpassing the previous record of 3.7 million viewers on March 19 , 2003 , at the beginning of the Iraq War .
Tuesday night ’s debate averaged 3.2 million viewers in the news demographic of adults 25 - 54 .
It aired from 9 - 10:36 p.m. ET .
The debate , which was moderated by “ NBC Nightly News ” anchor Brian Williams and Washington bureau chief Tim Russert , aired also on NBC ’s broadcast affiliates in Ohio .
Since it aired with the same commercials on broadcast TV and MSNBC , the 744,000 or so viewers who made it Ohio ’s top TV broadcast of the night were counted in MSNBC ’s national rating .
It beat “ American Idol ” by 44 % in the Ohio markets , which included Cleveland , Cincinnati , Dayton and Columbus .

About a year ago , I posted a general description of how to make your own laundry detergent that proved quite popular .
That article basically described in a general sense how one could make laundry detergent at home very cheaply , but it left out a lot of key issues : does it work well ?
What does it look like as you are making it ?
What are the real - world costs and time investment ?
What equipment do you need ?
This past weekend , I made a fresh batch of homemade laundry detergent and I took a ton of notes and pictures .
I enjoyed the process - I got to make a giant bucket of slime in the kitchen and my wife approved .
Let 's see what we can learn from the process that might save us some cash .
Making the Laundry Detergent
The only ingredients you actually need for homemade laundry detergent are as follows :
1 cup washing soda ( I use Arm & Hammer )
1/2 cup borax ( I use 20 Mule Team )
1 bar soap ( I use whatever 's cheap , in this case Pure & Natural )
Approximately 3 gallons water
You 'll also need a container of some sort to store this in ( I use a five gallon bucket with a lid ) , something to stir it ( I use a large wooden spoon ) , another pot to boil soapy water in ( I use the pot in the picture ) , and something to cut up the soap ( I use the box grater in the picture ) .
First thing , put about four cups of water into the pan and put it on the stove on high until it's at boiling , then lower the heat until it 's simmering .
While it 's heating up , take a bar of soap and cut it up into little bits .
I found a lot of success using our box grater , which resulted in a ton of little soap curls .
When the water is boiling , start throwing in the soap .
I recommend just doing a bit at a time , then stirring it until it 's dissolved .
Here , I made the mistake of just tossing in all of the soap at once , which was n't particularly helpful :
Stir the soapy water with a spoon until all of the soap is dissolved .
Eventually , the water will take on the color of the soap you added , albeit paler .
I used Pure & Natural soap for this , which was a white soap that looked a lot like a bar of Ivory .
In the end , you 'll have some very warm soap soup :
Next , get out your large container and add three gallons of warm tap water to it .
I 'm using a bright orange five gallon bucket that I had lying around :
To this bucket add a cup of the washing soda and the soap solution you made and stir .
The borax is optional - some people say that it 's too harsh , but I 've always found that it did a good job getting clothes clean and fresh smelling , so I recommend adding a half cup of borax to the mix .
After stirring , you 'll have a bucket full of vaguely soapy water :
Do n't worry if your batch does n't match the color of my own - it varies depending on what kind of soap you use .
I made a batch with Lever 2000 in the past and it had a greenish tint to it , and I 've heard reports of all kinds of different colors from other people who have tried this .
At this point , let the soap sit for 24 hours , preferably with a lid on it .
I just took our bucket to the laundry room .
When you take off the lid , you 'll find any number of things , depending on the type of soap you used and the water you used .
It might be firm , like Jello ; it might be very watery ; it might even be like liquid laundry detergent .
Just stir it up a bit and it 's ready to be used .
My batch wound up being rather slimy .
It had some slimy - feeling water with various sized pieces of white gelatinous stuff floating in it .
Here 's what it looked like - I 'm using a video here because images do n't really capture it .
Do n't worry about the texture - it 's completely fine .
Just use a measuring cup and use one cup of the detergent per load of laundry .
If it 's got " globs " in it , get a mix of the water and of the globs - it'll break up very quickly in the washing machine and wash your clothes well .
If you 're still concerned , you can mash up the globs quite easily , but I saw no reason to do so .
How Well Does It Work ?
Naturally , I wanted to test this detergent out .
I tried to think of a good way to do something foul to a shirt , but something realistic - something I might do as a rather normal Midwestern guy that might also occur to any other guy in America .
The answer hit me quickly .
Mustard .
I took two white t- shirts and squirted them both down with mustard , all over the front .
Here are the two t- shirts :
The above t- shirt is the one I washed with Tide with Bleach Alternative , which is the laundry detergent we 've used by default when we do n't have any homemade detergent on hand .
It 's the one most highly recommended by Consumer Reports and this is the perfect opportunity to show what it can do .
After I took the picture , I smeared the mustard into the shirt a little .
The above t- shirt is the one I washed with my homemade detergent .
My mustard container ran out near the end here so the trail of mustard is n't as long .
I had already smeared in the mustard when I took this picture .
Also note , although the pictures do n't clearly reflect it , the one smeared with homemade detergent was somewhat dingier right off the bat - it's an older shirt , I believe .
Down in the laundry room , I pre-treated each stain by taking a small amount of each detergent and rubbing it into the stain with a brush .
Then , I washed each shirt in a normal load - one load with Tide with Bleach Alternative and one with my homemade detergent .
Which one won ?
I fully expected the Tide to win - in fact , I was just hoping the blowout was n't too bad so I would still have a good reason to write this article .
In fact , they turned out almost identically - they both smelled clean and looked quite white coming out of the dryer .
Take a look :
With the homemade detergent , you can still make out parts of the mustard streak , but other parts appear to be completely gone .
With a proper pre-treatment or a washing in bleach , this shirt would be as good as new .
With Tide with Bleach Alternative , the same exact story is true .
You can still make out where the stain was if you look close , but it 's almost completely gone .
A proper treatment would have resulted in no stain at all .
Here they are , side by side , for you to judge .
The Tide shirt is on the right , while the homemade detergent shirt is on the left :
They 're pretty close .
They 're both obviously very clean white tee shirts with a slightly noticeable mustard stain .
At different points in each mustard streak , the streak appears completely gone - at other places , it 's fairly noticeable .
That 's likely due more to my pre-treatment application than anything else .
Frankly , I could n't tell a difference between the two .
Both detergents produced a clean - smelling shirt .
Both produced a very white shirt with just a slight remnant of a mustard stain - a remnant that was almost identical in the two shirts .
In a nutshell , I believe my homemade detergent cleans comparably to Tide with Bleach Alternative .
The Cost Breakdown
Here 's what I paid for the ingredients :
The box of Borax , which contains enough Borax for at least twelve batches of detergent , cost $ 2.89 .
The box of washing soda , which contains enough soda for six batches of detergent , cost $ 1.89 .
The soap , which came in packs of three ( as pictured above ) , cost $ 0.89 per pack - I bought two , to ensure I had enough for six batches .
The Iowa sales tax on this stuff was $ 0.39 , giving me a total bill of $ 6.95 for the ingredients - enough for six batches .
I also used perhaps a penny 's worth of water and a penny 's worth of heat to heat it - a total cost of $ 6.97 .
Each batch of detergent contains 52 cups of the solution - 48 from the three gallons in the bucket , and four more cups of water with the dissolved soap .
Since I use one cup per load , this means a single batch makes 52 loads ' worth of detergent .
Let 's say , hypothetically , that I make six batches of the stuff and use the other half of the box of Borax for something else .
That means I 've made enough detergent for 312 loads of laundry for a total cost of $ 6.97 .
That 's roughly two and a quarter cents per load of laundry .
Let 's look up Tide with Bleach Alternative , the Consumer Reports recommended detergent .
You can buy four bottles of the 150 ounce Tide with Bleach Alternative from Amazon for $ 62.60 .
We 'll assume free shipping and no taxes here to help Tide 's case out .
Each of those
Tide bottles has enough detergent for 78 loads of laundry , meaning the case will cover 312 loads of laundry .
Thus , each load of laundry using Tide with Bleach Alternative costs almost exactly $ 0.20 for detergent costs .
In other words , nine loads using my homemade detergent has the same detergent cost as one load of Tide with Bleach Alternative .
To put it in another perspective , let 's say I do one load of laundry a day for a year using each detergent .
Using my homemade stuff , I spend $ 8.15 for the detergent over the course of the year .
Using Tide with Bleach Alternative , I spend $ 73.23 over the course of a year .
Using my homemade detergent instead saves me $ 65.08 a year .
Plus , it was fun to make .
My Conclusion
Given that the detergent seems to do roughly as well as our regular name - brand detergent and is ridiculously cheaper , I plan on using my homemade detergent for the foreseeable future .
I make no claims or guarantees as to the effect the detergent will have long term on your clothes - frankly , I do n't know .
But I do know it cleans well - it passes muster for me and seems to handle difficult stains roughly as well as Tide with Bleach Alternative - and I do know I plan on using it for a long while .
It 's hard to say no to that kind of savings .
The mysterious credibility McCain has ‘ in the bank ’
Last week ’s biggest campaign screw - up came when John McCain , on at least four separate occasions , claimed that al Qaeda terrorists have traveled to Iran , received support , and then re-entered Iraq to fight U.S. forces .
Obviously , that ’s false .
The good news is , the Sunday morning shows were kind enough to mention the embarrassing incident .
The bad news is , what the various pundits said about the episode .
On “ Meet the Press , ” for example , Tim Russert asked NBC political director Chuck Todd if McCain ’s confusion about Middle Eastern basics will “ hurt a McCain candidacy . ”
Todd ’s response was interesting .
For those who ca n’t watch clips online , here ’s what Todd said :
“ Well , what ’s odd about the , the stumble is that it — is it a stumble or was it , or was it that this talking point that he ’d been , that he ’d been using for actually a couple weeks or over a week , where he was talking about sort of almost blurring that the , the enemy of al - Qaeda and the enemy of the , the Shia - trained Iranians and sort of blurring them as one enemy .
And the , the question is , did he just sort of — he truncated it to the point where he ended up misspeaking .
“ The , the problem , of course , McCain has is that he can ’t , you know , he does n’t want to make it so that he , he forgot it for a minute .
You know , he ’s — because of the age issue , he can’t ever look like he ’s having a senior moment .
So instead , he ’s better off going ahead and saying , you know , ‘ OK , so he misspoke . ’
Even if he gets dinged on the experience stuff , ‘ Oh , he says he ’s Mr. Experience .
Does n’t he know the difference between this stuff ? ’
He ’s got enough of that in the bank , at least with the media , that he can get away with it .
“ I mean , the irony to this is had either Senator Clinton or Senator Obama misspoke like that , it ’d have been on a running loop , and it would become a , a big problem for a couple of days for them . ”
I think this analysis is largely right — though I do n’t know why Todd kept insisting that McCain “ misspoke ” after conceding that the senator made the same mistake repeatedly — but I was especially struck by his reference to the credibility McCain has “ in the bank . ”
This is n’t to say Todd ’s wrong .
He did n’t say McCain had earned this credibility , or even deserves it , but rather that the media is simply willing to give McCain the benefit of the doubt .
The senator can screw up the basics , over and over again , and reporters will just assume , “ McCain knows what he ’s talking about , so must not have meant what he said . ”
I suspect it ’s the same problem that exists with McCain and the unhinged , right - wing TV preachers he ’s embraced during his campaign .
I get the sense that reporters give him a pass based on a faulty assumption : “ McCain is n’t really a crazed evangelical bigot , so he must not agree with these nutty televangelists . ”
I ’m fairly certain this is n’t going to happen , but a skeptical , independent press corps that takes its responsibilities seriously may want to consider why it ’s so quick to make these assumptions .
Indeed , ideally reporters would n’t make any assumptions at all about what McCain “ knows ” and “ believes . ”
What ’s more , the problem was apparent beyond just “ Meet the Press . ”
The Washington Post ’s George Will asserted that Sen. John McCain ’s admittedly false claim that Iran is training Al Qaeda is “ [ n ] ot damaging at all ” to McCain , “ because people say it ’s a given that this man knows what he ’s talking about . ”
Similarly , The Chicago Tribune ’s Jill Zuckman asserted that “ I do n’t think many people believe ” “ the argument that McCain does n’t know what he ’s talking about when it comes to foreign policy . ”
But neither Will nor Zuckman noted that McCain has made that error more than once .
It ’s not only maddening , it ’s the kind of negligent journalism that can dictate the outcome of a presidential election .
McCain has made a series of bizarre and demonstrably false claims about foreign policy , military affairs , and national security .
Some have registered in the media , some have n’t .
Either way , reporters have already made up their minds — McCain knows his stuff , even when he does n’t , and all reporting on the senator ’s campaign will be refracted through that agreed upon prism .
It was n’t conscious .
I do n’t seriously believe there was a meeting and campaign reporters agreed on which assumptions were fair to make .
But groupthink led to the same result — all the reporters “ know ” John McCain is an “ expert , ” in large part because he ’s John McCain .
Evidence that bolsters this conclusion is embraced , and evidence that contradicts it is ignored .
It ’s the kind of advantage a major - party presidential candidate would pay any price to receive , and our campaign reporters have decided to give it to McCain for free .
That must have been some barbecue .

みなさんは複数 のLinux環境が必要な場合、どうされていますか？
最近のマシンはとても高性能なため、仮想化環境で構築している方も多いと思われますが、昔ながらのマルチブート環境で構築されている方もまだまだいらっしゃるかと思います。
今回は、そんなマルチブートマシンからモニタやキーボードを外した状態でも、マルチブートのメニューを操作する方法です。
開発や実験などに使うサブマシンの場合、SSHで接続できるように設定した後は、モニタやキーボードは不要ですので、外してしまいたいところですが、マルチブート環境の場合、OS切替時のブートメニューの操作があるためそうもいきません。
KVMスイッチなどの切替機を使ってもいいのですが、シリアルケーブルを使ってモニタ/キーボードレスにしてみたいと思います。
なお、マルチブートのためのブートローダーとしては、Linuxディストリビューションで良く使われているGNU GRUBを使用します。
まず、サブマシンの / boot / grub/ menu.lst ( grub.conf ) へ次の二行を追加します 。
serial -- unit=0 --speed=9600 -- word=8 -- parity=no -- stop=1 terminal -- timeout=10 serial console
また、「splashimage」の行がある場合は、行頭へ「#」を付けてコメントアウトしておきます。
次に、メインマシンとサブマシンをシリアルケーブルで接続します。メインマシンがノートPCなどのようにシリアル端子がない場合は、USB-シリアル変換を使って接続します。
そして、メインマシン がWindows環境であればTeraTermやPuTTY、LinuxであればMinicomなどのターミナルソフトでCOMポートへ接続します。
なお、COMポートの設定は次のようにしておきます。
通信速度 : 9600 データ長 : 8 bit ストップ : 1 bit パリティ : None フロー制御 : None
後は、ターミナルソフトを起動したまま、サブマシンを起動します。
ターミナルソフトの画面 へ「 Press any key to continue .
」と表示されると思いますので、そこでキーを押してGRUBのメニューが表示されれば成功です。
Press any key to continue .
Press any key to continue .
Press any key to continue .
GNU GRUB version 0.95 ( 639 K lower / 259969 K upper memory ) +-------------------------------------------------------------+ | Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS | | Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 | | CentOS 4 | | CentOS 5 | | Debian GNU / Linux Etch | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | +-------------------------------------------------------------+
Use the ^ and v keys to select which entry is highlighted .
Press enter to boot the selected OS , 'e ' to edit the commands before booting , ' a ' to modify the kernel arguments before booting , or ' c ' for a command - line .
あとは通常通り起動するOSを選択するだけです。
これでサブマシンが無事モニタ/キーボードレスになりました！
ちなみに、このままシリアルコンソールでログインしたい場合は、サブマシンの
/etc/inittab へ
s0:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0 vt100
を追加し、/boot/grub/menu.lst ( grub.conf ) の「 kernel 」 行へ
kernel …… console=tty0 console=tty S0,9600n8
を追加すればターミナルへログインプロンプトが表示されるようになります。
また、その場合は、表示を速くするためにボーレートの設定を115200へ変更したほうが快適になるかと思います。

Casey sees Obama as an " underdog " in the campaign who sacrificed at the beginning of his career to be a community organizer " in the shadows of the closed steel mills in Chicago , " said a source close to Casey who is familiar with the endorsement decision but was not authorized to speak publicly about it .
Jonathan Schell has a good article addressing some of the arguments against total nuclear disarmament .
Interestingly , he turns one potentially pro-nuclear argument around : Some proponents of nuclear weaponry say it is futile to rid of them , since people will always be able to create them , now that the technology is known .
But Schell says this is a reason not to worry that some rogue nation with the only nukes in the world can hold the planet hostage — the larger powers could always create nukes if they needed to for deterrence , and the threat of doing so and retaliating is an effective sort of deterrence in itself .
The article cuts nicely to one of the main problems with the current reality of a world with 25,000 nuclear weapons : “ Human beings are fallible .
A single mistake in the nuclear realm can mean the end of cities , nations or all of us .
Fallible human nature and instruments of annihilation make bad company , and should be parted .
Let ’s remember the deterrence formula — a threat to use nuclear weapons that aims to produce non-use .
The trouble is that the world is held perpetually on a knife ’s edge , uncertain about witnessing the non-use that ’s hoped for or the use that ’s threatened . ”
From a natural rights perspective , and practicing a methodological individualism in our analysis , we can see the problem with nuclear weapons as devices of self - defense .
Pro-war Second Amendment enthusiasts and anti-gun , antiwar liberals alike will often argue that the difference between nuclear arms and personal arms is a mere difference in degree , not kind .
But as Murray N. Rothbard put it :
“ It has often been maintained , and especially by conservatives , that the development of the horrendous modern weapons of mass murder ( nuclear weapons , rockets , germ warfare , etc. ) is only a difference of degree rather than kind from the simpler weapons of an earlier era .
Of course , one answer to this is that when the degree is the number of human lives , the difference is a very big one .
But another answer that the libertarian is particularly equipped to give is that while the bow and arrow and even the rifle can be pinpointed , if the will be there , against actual criminals , modern nuclear weapons cannot .
Here is a crucial difference in kind .
Of course , the bow and arrow could be used for aggressive purposes , but it could also be pinpointed to use only against aggressors .
Nuclear weapons , even “ conventional ” aerial bombs , cannot be .
These weapons are ipso facto engines of indiscriminate mass destruction .
( The only exception would be the extremely rare case where a mass of people who were all criminals inhabited a vast geographical area . )
We must , therefore , conclude that the use of nuclear or similar weapons , or the threat thereof , is a sin and a crime against humanity for which there can be no justification . “
Surely , even in cold strategic terms , nuclear weapons are no sensible or effective remedy to America ’s foreign enemies of today — terrorists hijacking planes , setting off improvised devices or , God forbid , launching bio warfare .
Nuclear weapons offer even less deterrence against stateless terrorists than they did against the USSR .
After the Cold War , Robert Higgs asked if nuclear weapons could be scrapped .
I must agree fully with Higgs ’s characterization of the anti-nuclear weapons cause as a “ crusade for sanity . ”
WordPress 2.5 , the culmination of six months of work by the WordPress community , people just like you .
The improvements in 2.5 are numerous , and almost entirely a result of your feedback : multi- file uploading , one - click plugin upgrades , built - in galleries , customizable dashboard , salted passwords and cookie encryption , media library , a WYSIWYG that does n’t mess with your code , concurrent post editing protection , full - screen writing , and search that covers posts and pages .
For a short overview of the features with screenshots , it ’d be best to visit our sneak peek announcement for RC1 .
Or check out a 4 - minute screencast of the new interface in action .
If you just want to jump straight to the good stuff here ’s where you can find 2.5 upgrade and download information .
If you want to see everything I would grab a cup of coffee or a mojito , because this post is epic .
User Features
Cleaner , faster , less cluttered dashboard — we ’ve worked hard to take your feedback about what ’s most important in the dashboard and organize things to allow you to focus on what ’s important — your blog — and get out of your way .
In collaboration with Happy Cog and the community we ’ve taken the first major step forward in the WordPress interface since version 1.5 .
Dashboard Widgets — the dashboard home page is now a series of widgets , including ones to show you fun stats about your posting , latest comments , people linking to you , new and popular plugins , and of course WordPress news .
You can customize any of the dashboard widgets to show , for example , news from your local paper instead of WP news .
Plugins can also hook in , for example the WordPress.com stats widget adds a handy double - wide stats box .
Multi - file upload with progress bar — before when you would upload a large file you ’d wait forever , never knowing how far along it was .
And uploading more than one photo was an exercise in patience , as you could only do one at a time .
Now you can select a whole of folder images or music or videos at once and it ’ll show you the progress of each upload .
Bonus : EXIF extraction — if you upload JPEG files with EXIF metadata like camera make and model , aperture , shutter speed , ISO , et al .
WordPress will extract all the data into custom fields you can use in your template .
If you use the EXIF title fields or similar those will be put into their equivalent fields in WP .
Most modern digital cameras generate EXIF data .
Search posts and pages — search used to cover just posts , now it includes pages too , a great boon for those using WordPress as a CMS .
New themes can style or sort pages differently in results .
Tag management — you can now add , rename , delete , and do whatever else you like to tags from inside WordPress , no plugins needed .
Password strength meter — when you change your password on your profile it ’ll tell you how strong your password is to help you pick a good one .
Concurrent editing protection — for those of you on multi- author blogs , have you ever opened a post while someone was already editing it , and your auto - saves kept overwriting each other , irrecoverably losing hours of work ?
I bet that added a few words to your vocabulary .
Now if you open a post that someone else is editing , WordPress magically locks it and prevents you from saving until the other person is done .
You ’ll see a message like below .
Few - click plugin upgrades — if the plugins you use are part of the plugin directory since 2.3 we ’ve told you when they have an update available .
Now we take that to the next logical step — downloading and installing the upgrade for you .
This is dependent a little bit on your host setup , and it may ask you for your FTP password much like OS X or Windows will ask you for a password , but it works well on majority of hosts we were able to test , your mileage may vary , plugins in mirror may be larger than they appear .
Friendlier visual post editor —
I ’m not sure how to articulate this improvement except to say “ it does n’t mess with your code anymore . ”
We ’re now using version 3.0 of TinyMCE , which means better compatibility with Safari , and we ’ve paid particular attention this release to its integration and interaction with complex HTML .
It also now has a “ no - distractions ” mode which is like Writeroom for your browser .
Built - in galleries — when you take advantage of multi- file upload to upload a bunch of photos , we have a new shortcode that lets you to easily embed galleries by just putting [ gallery ] ( without the space ) in your post .
It ’ll display all your thumbnails and captions and each will link each to a page where people can comment on the individual photos .
I ’ve been using this feature on my blog and have already uploaded over 1,200 pictures into 23 galleries .
The shortcode has some hidden options too , check out this documentation .
Developer Features
Now for the geeky stuff .
While we ’re excited about the above features , each one represents a new opportunity or API for other developers to take to another level .
( The best of which we ’ll someday integrate back into WP . )
Salted passwords — we now use the phpass library to stretch and salt all passwords stored in the database , which makes brute - forcing them impractical .
If you use something like mod_auth_mysql we ’ve created a plugin that will allow you to use legacy MD5 hashing .
( The hashing is completely pluggable . )
Users will automatically switch to the more secure passwords next time they log in .
Secure cookies — cookies are now encrypted based on the protocol described in this PDF paper .
which is something like user name |expiration time |HMAC ( user name |expiration time , k ) where k = HMAC ( user name |expiration time , sk ) and where sk is a secret key , which you can define in your config .
Easy taxonomy and URL creation — probably best illustrated with an example : I can call register_taxonomy ( ) with a few arguments to register a “ people ” taxonomy and whenever I edit an image I ’ll see a UI like tags has for identifying the people in a photo , and these will be URL addressable with / person / firstname - lastname / .
All with a single function call .
Inline documentation — the vast majority of the new code going into WordPress include inline documentation that explains the functions and documents their arguments .
Database optimization — we have n’t changed the table layout in this release , which is one of the reasons so many plugins work fine with 2.5 .
We have added a few new indicies and made a few default fields more flexible based on some bottlenecks we found on WordPress.com , which now hosts 2.7 million WordPress blogs .
It should be invisible to the application , just a bit faster on the database side .
$ wpdb -> prepare ( ) — now almost all of the SQL in WordPress is prepared first , and the same functions are available to your plugins .
This should prevent elementary SQL escaping issues .
Media buttons — the add media buttons above the post are both expandable , so you could have an “ Add Google Map ” button if you like , They can be overridden , so if you think you can do the video or audio tab better than we have you can replace the default .
Shortcode API — the new gallery functionality is powered by the new shortcode API .
Shortcodes are little bracket - delineated strings that can be magically expanded at runtime to something more interesting .
They give users a short , easy to type and copy / paste string they can move around their post without worrying about messing up complex HTML or embed codes .
The Shortcode API is fully documented .
Now you see why 2.5 took a little extra time . 🙂
Upgrade Notes
2.5 does include security fixes so it is recommended for all users , the 2.3 branch will no longer be updated .
The upgrade instructions for this version are pretty much the same as any other version .
The most important thing to check is your plugins , so if for example everything works except the new uploader , a legacy plugin might be causing a javascript error on the page and breaking it .
If something goes wrong , the safest thing to do is turn your plugins off ( we have a button to do them all at once , now ) and turn them back on one - by - one , testing the problem along the way .
This has solved almost everybody ’s problems in testing , and it also lets you know which plugin author to show some love to so they ’ll update their plugin , and which plugin authors already have so you can shower them with praises on your blog .
One brief note about some of the new upload and plugin upgrade features , there are some edge - case hosting platforms , like versions of Lighttpd before 1.5 or over - agressive mod_security rules , which can break .
If something is n’t working like it was looked in the screenshot , ask your host if there ’s something on the server side which may be interfering .
Hosts , feel free to join and post to our wp - testers mailing list if you have an environment that requires some extra code to work around .
We ’d be happy to include it in the next update .
Quick tip : in 2.5 you click the name of things to edit them , like your username to edit your profile or the title of a post to edit it .
The Community is Growing
More than growing , it ’s on fire .
We always talk about things like downloads , and the 2.3 branch has already had 1.92 million downloads as I write this post , but this time we have some far more interesting information I ’d like to share .
There were over 1,200 commits to our repository since 2.3.0 and over 90 people were credited in them .
This means in our core code , not plugins , there were at least 90 individual folks that contributed something high - quality enough that it made the cut to be part of the download you guys get today .
I had no idea this group of people was so large .
Outside of the core commit team , there was particular help from these people , in rough order of number of credits and tickets : mdawaffe ( Michael Adams ) , azaozz ( Andrew Ozz ) , nbachiyski ( Nikolay Bachiyski ) , andy ( Andy Skelton ) , iammattthomas ( Matt Thomas ) , tellyworth ( Alex Shiels ) , josephscott ( Joseph Scott ) , lloydbudd ( Lloyd Budd ) , DD32 ( Dion ) , filosofo ( Austin Matzko ) , hansengel ( Hans Engel ) , pishmishy , ffemtcj , Viper007Bond , ionfish ( Benedict Eastaugh ) , jhodgdon ( Jennifer Hodgdon ) , Otto42 , thee17 ( Charles E. Free - Melvin ) , and xknown .
Also want to thank MichaelH and Lorelle on the documentation side , and moshu , Kafkaesqui , whooami , MichaelH , Otto42 , and jeremyclark13 for helping with support .
The 2.5 branch is nicknamed “ Brecker ” in honor of Michael Brecker , an exceptionally talented saxophonist who could cross styles effortlessly and never stopped experimenting and pushing himself until he passed away last year .
New WordPress.org
All of this was n’t enough , so in our copious spare time we decided to redesign WordPress.org to better match the aesthetics of the new dashboard and also to spruce up a few areas that needed lovin’ .
Some parts of the site , like the Codex , might show the old style for a day or two .
We know , just give us a bit of time .
Thanks to Matt Thomas for his epic effort in designing and coding the new site .
What ’s Next
As always with WordPress , we do n’t claim any of these features to be perfect , or to be better than everyone else in the world , but they are done by and for the people and the one thing we do promise is that with every release we listen and do our best to improve .
2.5 is a major milestone for WordPress not because it added dozens of user - requested features , but because it reaffirms that we ’re as passionate about blogging as the day we started .
Our community is too fierce to rest on its laurels — contrary to what pundits claim , blogging is far from “ finished ” and every improvement just whets our appetite for more .
And more is coming .
It ’s a good thing WordPress does n’t limit the length of posts , because this one would have hit it .
If you made it this far , thanks for sharing a bit of your day with us .
I sincerely hope this new version of WordPress helps you do what you love to do .

John McCain 's temper is well known to most of us and you 'd figure he'd do his best to keep it in check .
He lost it a little bit today with the Times ’ Elisabeth Bumiller .
I guess she 's not allowed to ask about an actual event that happened to him involving John Kerry back in '04 .
FOX did n't show the whole exchange unfortunately .
Update : Watching it again , I think " cranky " is a better description .
You may remember how nasty McCain got with Barack back in '06 after Obama decided " he preferred his own party 's legislation to a task force and suggested McCain take another look at the Democratic caucus 's Honest Leadership Act , which does not have a Republican cosponsor . "
Wrote Obama : " I know you have expressed an interest in creating a task force to further study and discuss these matters , but I and others in the Democratic Caucus believe the more effective and timely course is to allow the committees of jurisdiction to roll up their sleeves and get to work [ . ] "
McCain was n't very happy and fired off this response : " I understand how important the opportunity to lead your party 's effort to exploit this issue must seem to a freshman Senator , and I hold no hard feelings over your earlier disingenuousness .

ABC :
New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller : Senator can I ask you about Senator Kerry .
I just went back and looked at our story , the Times story , and you told Sheryl Stolberg that you had never had a conversation with Kerry about being , about Vice President – John McCain : Everybody knows that I had a private conversation .
Everybody knows that .
That I had a conversation .
There ’s no living American in Washington - EB : Okay .
McCain : - that knows that , there ’s no one .
EB : Okay McCain :
And you know it too .
You know it .
You know it .
So I do n’t even know why you ask .
EB : Well I ask because I just read –- McCain :
You do know it .
You do know it .
EB : Because I just read in the Times in May of ’04 you said .
McCain : I do n’t know what you may have read or heard of , I do n’t know the circumstances .
Maybe in May of 04 I had n’t had the conversation -- EB : But do you recall the conversation ?
McCain : I do n’t know , but it ’s well known that I had the conversation .
It is absolutely well known by everyone .
So do you have a question on another issue ?
And then we have McCain throwing an F - bomb at Rep. John Cornyn last March over an immigration dispute .
Do you think McCain could use a few anger management meetings to help him with his temper ?
( the rest of the exchange and take the AOL Hot Seat poll below the fold )
Official figures show that China 's inflation rate reached an 11 - year high in February .
The consumer price index increased to 8.7 per cent in the month , up from 7.1 per cent in January .
The higher than expected reading comes as China 's economy grows at about 11.4 per cent a year .
A senior international economist at Westpac Bank , Huw McKay , says the jump in inflation is a result of shortages in supply , and that could be good news for Australian exporters .
" There were some pretty brutal snow storms hitting large patches of China which usually are below the snowline at this time of year , " he said .
" [ It ] has hit crops very badly , it 's hurt the transport infrastructure , so it 's been very difficult to get food from other parts of the country to bail people out .
" Because China is such a dominant player in many commodity markets , when their supply situation is so constrained , that will push up the prices of a broad range of commodities in internationally - traded markets .
" That 's something that will help Australian exporters . "
Physical and mental health can have profound impacts on our relationships with ourselves , our partners , and our friends and family .

Alright !
Let 's get things going on this blog .
This is officially the first blog post on my new blog .
As I mentioned in about this blog post , one of the things I love to do is figuring out how to get something done with the wrong set of tools .
It usually reveals obscure and unexpected features of these tools and lets me approach things creatively .
I love obscure things and creativity .
This will be a tutorial on how to download YouTube videos with nothing but Awk .
I love watching YouTube videos .
One of the latest videos I watched was this brilliant commercial .
Also I love programming and one of the languages I learned recently was AWK or as I like to capitalize it – Awk .
The name of this language comes from the initials of its designers – Aho , Weinberger , Kernighan .
The question is – is it be possible to download YouTube videos with awk command line tool ?!
After all it's a text processing language .
I do n't want to go into language details today as it's not my goal .
I only want it to download videos .
If you want to learn this awesome language check out this tutorial .
Awk language originally does n't have networking support so without help of some networking tools which would create a network connection for us to pipe contents from YouTube to awk we would be out of luck .
Also awk is not quite suited for handling binary data , so we will have to figure out how to read large amounts of binary data from the net in an efficient manner .
Let 's find out what Google has to say about awk and networking .
Quick search for ' awk + networking ' gives us an interesting result - " TCP / IP Internetworking With `gawk ' " .
Hey , wow !
Just what we were looking for !
Networking support for awk in GNU 's awk implementation through special files !
Quoting the manual :
The special file name for network access is made up of several fields , all of which are mandatory : /inet/ protocol/localport/hostname/remoteport
Cool !
We know that the web talks over the tcp protocol port 80 and we are accessing www.youtube.com for videos .
So the special file for accessing YouTube website would be :
/ inet/tcp/0/www.youtube.com/80
( localport is 0 because we are a client )
Now let 's test this out and get the banner of the YouTube 's webserver by making a HEAD HTTP request to the web server and reading the response back .
The following script will get the HEAD response from YouTube :
BEGIN { YouTube = " / inet/tcp/0/www.youtube.com/80 " print " HEAD / HTTP /1.0\r
\r
" |& YouTube while ( ( YouTube |& getline ) > 0 ) print $ 0 close ( YouTube ) }
I saved this script to youtube .
head.awk file and and run gawk from command line on my Linux box :
pkrumins@graviton : ~$ gawk youtube.head.awk HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date : Mon , 09 Jul 2007 21:41:59 GMT
Server : Apache ... [ truncated ]
Yeah !
It worked !
Now , let 's find out how YouTube embeds videos on their site .
We know that the video is played with a flash player so html code which displays it must be present .
Let 's find it .
I 'll go a little easy here so the users with less experience can learn something , too .
Suppose we did not know how the flash was embedded in the page .
How could we find it ?
One way would be to notice that the title of the video is ' The Wind ' and then search this string in the html source until we notice something like ' swf ' which is extension for flash files , or ' flash ' .
The other way would be to use a better tool like FireFox browser 's FireBug extension and arrive at the correct place in source instantly without searching the source but by bringing up the FireBug 's console and inspecting the emedded flash movie .
After doing this we would find that YouTube videos are displayed on the page by calling this JavaScript function which generates the appropriate html :
SWFObject ( " / player2.swf<strong>?hl=en&video_id=2mTLO2F_ERY&l=123&t=OEgsToPDskK5DwdDH6isCsg5GtXyGpTN&soff=1&sk=sZLEcvwsRsajGmQF7OqwWAU</strong > "
Visiting this URL http://www.youtube.com/player2.swf?hl=en...
loads the video player in full screen .
Not quite what we want .
We want just the video file that is being played in the video player .
How does this flash player load the video ?
There are two ways to find it out - use a network traffic analyzer like Wireshark ( previously Ethereal ) or disassembling their flash player using SoThink 's SWF Decompiler ( it 's commercial , i do n't know a free alternative .
can be bought here ) to see the ActionScript which loads the movie .
I hope to show how to find the video file url using both of these methods in future posts .
UPDATE : This is no longer true .
Now YouTube gets videos by taking ' video_id ' and 't ' id from the following JavaScript object :
var swfArgs = {hl : 'en ', video_id :'xh_LmxEuFo8 ' , l:'39 ' , t:'OEgsToPDskKwChZS_16Tu1BqrD4fueoW ',sk :'ZU0 Zy4ggmf9MYx1oVLUcYAC'} ;
UPDATE : This is no longer true .
Now YouTube gets videos by taking ' video_id ' and 't ' id from the following JavaScript object :
var swfArgs = { " BASE_YT_URL " : " http://youtube.com/ " , " video_id " : " JJ51hx3wGgI " , " l " : 242 , " sk " : " sZLEcvwsRsajGmQF7OqwWAU " , " t " : " OEgsToPDskJfAwvlG0JDr8 cO-HVq2RaB " , " hl " : " en " , " plid " : " AARHZ9SrFgUPvbFgAAAAcADYAAA " , " e " : " h " , " tk " : " KVRgpgeftCUWrYaeqpikCbNxXMXKmdUoGtfTNVkEouMjv1SwamY- Wg=="} ;
UPDATE : This is also no longer true .
Now YouTube gets videos by requesting it from one of the urls specified in ' fmt_url_map ' , which is located in the following JavaScript object :

We need to extract these two ids and make a request string '?video_id=xh_LmxEuFo8&t=OEgsToPDskKwChZS_16Tu1BqrD4fueoW ' .
The rest of the article describes the old way YouTube handled videos ( before update ) , but it is basically the same .
For now , I can tell you that once the video player loads it gets the FLA ( flash movie ) file from :
http://www.youtube.com/get_video<strong>?hl=en&video_id=2mTLO2F_ERY&l=123&t=OEgsToPDskK5DwdDH6isCsg5GtXyGpTN&soff=1&sk=sZLEcvwsRsajGmQF7OqwWAU</strong>
Where the string in bold after ' http://www.youtube.com/get_video' is the same that is in the previous fragment after player 2.swf ( both in bold ) .
If you now entered the url into a browser it should popup the download dialog and you should be able save the flash movie to your computer .
But it 's not that easy !
YouTube actually 302 redirects you to one or two other urls before the video download actually starts !
So we will have to handle these HTTP redirects in our awk script because awk does not know anything about HTTP protocol !
So basically all we have to do is construct an awk script which would find the request string ( previously in bold ) , append it to ' http://www.youtube.com/get_video' and handle the 302 redirects and finally save the video data to file .
Since awk has great pattern matching built in already we can extract the request string ( in bold previously ) by getting html source of the video page then searching for a line which contains SWFObject ( " / player2.swf and extracting everything after the ? up to " .
So here is the final script .
Copy or save it to ' get_youtube_vids.awk ' file and then it can be used from command line as following :
gawk -f get_youtube_vids.awk < http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID1> [ http://youtube.com/watch?v=ID2 | ID2 ] ...
For example , to download the video commercial which I told was great you 'd call the script as :
gawk -f get_youtube_vids.awk
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mTLO2F_ERY
or just using the ID of the video :
gawk -f get_youtube_vids.awk 2mTLO2F_ERY

Each function is well documented so the code should be easy to understand .
If you see something can be improved or optimized , just comment on this page .
Also if you would like that I explain each fragment of the source code in even more detail , let me know .
The most interesting function in this script is save_file which does chunked downloading in a hacky way ( see the comments in the source ) .

A great number of American women face shorter life expectancy than in the early 1980s , scientists say .
The trend of women 's life expectancy decline is evident in nearly 1,000 counties , where about 12 percent of American women live
This tendency can be observed in rural and low - income areas , but is likely to spread across the United States in the coming years .
The most dramatic decline was observed in two areas in southwestern Virginia , where life expectancy dropped by more than five years since 1983 .
Experts explain that decrease in women 's life expectancy is caused by the long - term effects of smoking , that became popular among women decades after men fell into this habit .
This led to the increasing number of death from such diseases as diabetes , lung cancer , kidney problems and emphysema .
Another problem that caused the decline of women 's life expectancy is the obesity epidemic that has risen in the past two decades .
Christopher J.L. Murray , a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Washington , and the leading researcher the study thinks that this is an alarming sign .
He explained that the tendency seems to be characteristic for Americans , as in other countries in Western Europe , Australia , Japan , New Zealand there was no such decline .
The decline in US men's longevity was smaller and was observed in fewer places .
Scientists say that downfall of life expectancy over long periods is driven by huge factors , such as AIDS epidemic in Africa or social disturbances like the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Murray and his colleagues studied mortality and information about the causes of the death from 1961 to 1999 .
The analysis showed that during a period from 1961 to 1983 , the average life expectancy in the US rose by nearly 7 years for men and almost 6 years for women .
This is attributed to the decline in death rates from heart attack due to the improvements in medicine .
However , by the beginning of 1980s this increase slowed down and further improvements were seen mostly in areas with high life expectancy .
Nearly one in five American women is now facing the decreasing longevity .
Extreme obesity , smoking and increased blood pressure are mostly to blame .
The study is published in PLoS Medicine , an open - access journal of the Public Library of Science .

HAVANA , Cuba ( CNN ) --
For the first time since Fidel Castro 's official resignation , Cubans are talking more about what the government is doing than what it 's not doing .
Cubans , like this woman at home in Havana , until now had been denied cell phones .
Now they are allowed .
In the past week , President Raúl Castro has legalized cell phone use for ordinary Cubans ; granted Cubans access to previously off - limits tourist hotels ; and legalized the sale within Cuba of microwaves , DVD players and personal computers .
Cubans are welcoming the change , even if the costs are out of their reach .
Georgina Garcia , a retired sound technician , was among those lined up at Dita , a store in Havana 's Vedado neighborhood .
" I ca n't afford to go to the hotels , " she said .
" But I think it 's good anyway .
I have the right to go , and I feel the same as the tourists who come here . "
Heriberto Gonzalez , a civil worker , said of the new freedoms , " Now that the prohibition has been lifted , we 'll see how far we go from here . "
Watch Cubans react to the loosened rules »
Jorge , who has a small business , did n't want to give his last name .
He said , " I think the Cuban people deserved this a while ago .
So Cubans look more like the rest of the world , like normal people . "
" Now we have to work on the workers ' salaries , which are n't enough to meet the prices of a DVD player or a computer . "
Cuba 's government had previously forbidden the sale of consumer products under the argument that they consumed too much electricity .
And although computers had n't yet been seen on the shelves Wednesday , Yamile Batista , the commercial director of La Puntilla department store , said they were among various products that would appear this week .
" We 're talking about complete computer systems , 21 - inch televisions , DVD players , home theater systems , " she said .
Georgina Garcia voiced a sentiment echoed by many in the stores this week .
" I think it 's good that I can have a computer and not overpay for it , have to hide it when they come to fumigate my house , worried that they 'll see the computer and I 'll be sent of to prison for the computer that I overpaid for from somebody who stole it , " she said .
Most Cubans can't afford to rent cell phones , stay in hotels or buy any of the new products available to them .
The average monthly salary is just under $ 20 .
Those in the stores this week were primarily those with access to hard currency , either from relatives abroad or through jobs in the tourist industry .
Cuba has a two - tiered currency system ; Cuban state workers are paid in the Cuban peso , but many products are only sold in the convertible peso , worth 24 times as much .

April 18 , 2008 at 16:54 Tags SICP
I 've completed the SICP reading project , which I began on June 19th , 2007 .
In hindsight , it seems like a very long time ( almost a year ! ) , during which this was my main hacking project at home .
So , in this conclusion I want to examine my progress , and compare the result with my initial goals .
The original plan was :
Read the book See all the video lectures by Sussman and Abelson themselves
Do most of the interesting exercises in the book
Do some of the larger projects listed here and here
Let 's see how I 've managed :
Done Done
This is the point I 'm most happy with .
I 've completed the vast majority of the exercises in SICP and posted them online .
Of the 356 exercises in the book , I 've skipped about 20 , so I 've completed 94 % of the exercises – which is far above my initial plans .
I did n't do this , but there 's no need , having completed so many of the exercises .
I feel I gained a completely solid understanding of the material , and wo n't gain much by doing the projects .
Also , I originally planned to reimplement all the code do all the exercises in Common Lisp .
Later I changed my mind and decided to use PLT Scheme for some of them .
Eventually , I 've been using both languages interchangeably , which is a good thing , as I got some practice with both .
Here are some numerical statistics that emphasize the magnitude of this endeavor :
I 've written 52 blog posts ( not including this one ) in the SICP category , spread over 10 months .
The combined total length of my posts ( including code snippets ) is 66,265 words .
For comparison , Jack London 's " Son of the Wolf " is 50 K words long .
Some of the large projects from the book I 've re-implemented in wholeness : a constraint propagation solver , an evaluator ( interpreter ) for Scheme , a generic object - oriented arithmetic package including complex and polynomial arithmetic , Huffman encoding , an interpreter for a logic programming language similar to Prolog ( as a DSL on top of Lisp ) , a picture - language interpreter , a simulator for digital circuits , a symbolic differentiation package , a virtual machine for a simplified pseudo - assembly DSL , an interpreter for Scheme written in this pseudo - assembly , and finally , a compiler for Scheme that spits out pseudo - assembly code .
Counting with the cloc tool ( Count Lines Of Code ) , the total physical LOC count1 for the code I 've written during this time : 7,300 LOC of Common Lisp , 4,100 LOC of Scheme .
If you prefer raw LOCs2 , it 's 10,800 LOC of Common Lisp , 5,600 LOC of Scheme .
So this is more than 10 KLOC of Lisp code , any way you look at it , which is a lot , since Lisp is a very expressive high - level functional language .
A word on SICP and its exercises .
Abelson and Sussman have created a masterpiece , a book initially written in the 1980s , and that still has n't lost one bit of relevance .
Everything it contains must , must be learned and understood by any aspiring programmer .
It teaches algorithms and data structures , good programming style , provides some contact with large systems , experimenting with their implementation and modification .
You will learn about functional programming , imperative programming , object - oriented programming in it .
You will learn how to implement interpreters , compilers , arithmetic systems , simulators , a whole virtual machine in it , and much more .
The exercises of SICP are essential to understanding .
Looking back at the work I 've done on the book , I do n't think I would have understood it near so well without doing a lot of the exercises .
There 's only so much material that can be gained from reading .
Getting your hands dirty with code is essential to true understanding .
And the authors of SICP brought this concept to perfection , with their excellent exercises , that are an unreplaceable companion to the book .
Although they 're not 100 % perfect , for the most part the exercises are very well thought out and tuned to aid understanding and practice writing parts of large systems .
1 Physical LOC : lines of code , excluding comments and blank lines .
To test my Common Lisp and Scheme code counts with cloc.pl , I used these commands :
cloc.pl -- force-lang= " Lisp " , lisp *.lisp cloc.pl -- force-lang= " Lisp " , scm *.scm
Earlier this week , the AP reporter Nedra Pickler published an odious story that questioned Barack Obama ’s patriotism through insinuation .
The entire focus of the story was to imply that Sen .
Obama may not be sufficiently patriotic to be president because he does n’t wear an American flag pin , and because he supposedly did n’t put his hand over his heart during a recent singing of the National Anthem .
( No , really . )
The article used what are now standard tricks in the playbook of a hollow and degraded media : using the “ some say ” technique to pass on right - wing innuendo as if it were serious news , making sure to give “ equal time ” to rumors and facts , and focusing obsessively on utterly irrelevant trivialities to the exclusion of legitimate and important issues .
( Haircuts , anyone ? )
Until recently , Obama had n’t been the presumptive nominee , and the media - abetted right - wing attacks had focused mainly on Hillary Clinton .
But as he increasingly takes on frontrunner status , it was inevitable that some of this slime would start coming his way .
I ’ve written before about why I did n’t intend to vote for Hillary Clinton in the primary ( and I did n’t ) , but I was equivocal about Obama .
His voting record is all - around solid progressive ; what I was more concerned about was the way he ’d handle himself in the general election .
Any Democratic presidential candidate is sure to face a barrage of vicious personal attacks .
Unlike Clinton – whose voting record I ’ve expressed my discontent with , but whose willingness to defend herself was not an issue – Obama seemed more of an unknown quantity to me .
Too many Democrats have lost elections by being timid in the face of Republican attacks , running away from their own positions or failing to defend themselves when criticized – or , worse , trying to deflect criticism by aping Republican positions .
( A tip to Democratic politicians :
When given a choice between real Republican and Republican - lite , conservatives vote for the real thing , and liberals do n’t vote . )
This incident was one of the first tests of how Obama would handle himself under pressure .
Today Obama responded , and I was extremely pleased to see that he seems to understand very well the game being played here :
“ A party that presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed , or were sending troops over who were untrained because of poor planning , or are not fulfilling the veterans ’ benefits that these troops need when they come home , or are undermining our Constitution with warrantless wiretaps that are unnecessary ?
“ That is a debate I am very happy to have .
We ’ll see what the American people think is the true definition of patriotism . ”
Yes , yes , yes !
This is the kind of response I ’ve been waiting for so long to hear from a progressive politician – one that does n’t tacitly concede the principle behind the Republican attack , that does n’t try to deflect it by acting more like them , but one that exposes their hypocrisy and takes the fight to them on their own turf .
I ’ve always firmly believed that Democrats could win elections in a landslide if they stopped running away from the mere whiff of criticism and started boldly and fearlessly standing up for what they ’re supposed to believe in .
There ’s ample ground to take the fight to the enemy , as Obama ’s response shows .
Given the outrageous injustices that have ensued when the Republicans are in power , the blatant and shameless way they sought and still seek to frighten the public and violate the Constitution for their own political benefit , they ’ve given us more than enough rope to hang them with .
They are defenseless on weak ground , which is why they attack constantly .
But we need a candidate who will point this out , who will make the case with fervor and passion , and who will not be cowed by pathetic attacks from the right - wing rumor mill .
After today , I ’m far more hopeful that Obama could be that candidate .
Excerpts from an article about Obama .
This is what happens when you interview “ average ” Americans .
Of Obama , Duser said : “ I ’m not crazy about voting for a colored guy , but that ’s not why I do n’t support Obama .
I ’m not prejudiced .
I just like Hillary . ”
A couple tables over , Jean Fetterman , a foster grandparent , said of Clinton : “ Oh , I love her .
She ’s a very intelligent person , and she has her husband who went through this . ”
She scoffs at the idea of voting for Obama : “ I do n’t want to be a Muslim ! ”
She looks dubious when told Obama is Christian .
“ Then why did he go see what ’s - his - name over in Iraq , that Lama ? ”
She is n’t clear about whom she means .
She may have seen a photo of Obama wearing traditional clothing during a visit to Africa .
“ I do n’t care what color he is , I do n’t care if he ’s pink , ” she said .
“ I do n’t think he ’s got the same education Hillary has , and he ’s so young .
He ’s arrogant , too . ”
I ’m too angry to write right now .
These fucking mouthbreathers make me violent .
I want to shake these people until the stupid falls out .
Listen very carefully .
Our government is n’t causing our country to fail .
That ’s an illusion .
It ’s these people .
They are the reason America is falling .
You ca n’t have a quality republic if the people are too ignorant to participate .
The republic will look like its people , and that ’s the problem .
It does .
Do n’t ever blame the government unless you advocate a government style capable of doing what it takes to maintain a minimum level of quality within a population .
See Finland , Sweden , Norway .
Without that we have guaranteed outcome — the stupid ( see quotes above ) will destroy the whole .
It ’s simply not possible for the ignorant to outbreed the educated and have a positive outcome within a democratic society .
Case in Point : more people in America believe Jesus will return within their lifetimes than believe in evolution .
In the year 2008 .
This country is , without a doubt , finished . :
After having been rewarded for solving the mystery of the Pink Panther Diamond , inspector Jacques Clouseau has been assigned to minor tasks by his boss inspector Dreyfus so as not to have him in his way anymore .

His past success will enable inspector Clouseau to be part of the dream team comprised of the greatest detectives of the affected countries , where he will be able to display his numerous talents across the world .

What part of “ we ca n’t sweat ” do n’t these people get ?
June 4 , 2006
Is it because there ’s no reliable mechanism in place to provide these animals with a means to cool themselves in 100 F heat ?
That ’s a possibility .
But take a look at just a few of our archive photos tagged “ pigs ” and you might catch a glimpse of a previously existing wallow , a generic garden hose for filling it , and a faucet to make the whole process as easy and union - friendly as possible .
Is it the big - word implications , like thermoregulation and hyperthermia ?
Could n’t possibly be the case given the breadth and depth of animal agricultural experience , education , and undifferentiated spin-ese wafting from this operation .
Is it because they ’re bound by law from providing a species - specific , physiologic necessity in the environment ?
Our friends at the pro shops had four words for that talking point , only two of which will make it into print : “ f — — - g load of b — — — t . ”
Or is it because they ’re just incapable of operating the faucet ?
Now that ’s a definite possibility .
But half a day and and some well - timed rewards could have the two long - loin lovelies themselves operating it at will .
Regardless of the excuse the only real question of any importance is , how long do these pigs have to suffer the scorching consequences ?
Props to RandomRunningGuys for the update .
Consistency is the better part of something we ’ll have to let you know about later once we figure out roughly what the hell it is .

It Mountain View , CA – After the announcement of a possible merger between Microsoft and Yahoo , Eric Schmidt , CEO of Google , announced that the search engine giant would be exiting its entire line of Internet businesses .
" I think you 're going to be seeing many other Internet companies doing the same , because the combined power of Microsoft and Yahoo will be overwhelming , " said Schmidt .
" The synergies created by Yahoo Search and Microsoft Live would soon lead them to dominate the market and frighten young children .
That 's not a world in which Google wishes to compete . "
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that indeed Facebook would be considering shuttering its site after hearing the news .
Other sites such as CNN.com and Ask.com were also considering shutting down .
Schmidt said that users of Google 's online services would have two weeks to download data such as email messages and search histories then they were " pulling the plug . "
Schmidt said Google would instead focus on its non-Internet businesses like Google Ponies and Google 's line of premium pasta sauces .
" They are not as profitable , but they 're a lot more fun .
Who does n't have fun with ponies ? "
To many , Google is the Internet , so the news was devastating .
" I 've sold my online soul to Google .
The things they know about me , even my best friends do n't know .
When they 're gone , it 'll be like a part of me is missing .
It 's a nightmare , " said Valerie Keenan from Rancho Cucamonga , California .
It 's nothing like the nightmares Schmidt has been having since hearing the news .
" In my dreams everywhere I turned I saw the hideous faces of Steve Ballmer and Jerry Yang lording over me .
Sergey and Larry were having the same visions .
We decided it was best just to end it now . "
Many analysts were confused by the move .
" Google would still have a leadership position in many of the Internet segments it competes , especially in the valuable search market , " said Frank Stanley from Merrill Lynch .
" I think those guys have been spending too much time on the party plane . "
Google 's stock was down on the news .
Related News Google Responds to Yahoo by Increasing Gmail Storage to Infinity Plus One Google Using Innovative Methods to Keep Employees Windows Vista Upgrade Decision Matrix Ballmer explained Microsoft 's strategy , " We 're not about dominating markets , we 're about eliminating markets for others , " he said .
Microsoft has a history of ending products as soon as the competition has been eliminated .
Most famously , Microsoft discontinued their graphical " Bob " operating system once competitors from Hasbro and Coleco were eliminated .

The Man Who Made Gasoline from Water
This story from the 1976 issue of Old Farmer 's Almanac ( OFA ) is fair game for RF Cafe because of its technical aspect , but there is yet another interesting reason that might require an amateur radio operator to notice .
" The Man Who Made Gasoline from Water " is about a 70 - year - old inventor named Louis Enricht who in 1916 tried to convince would - be investors that he had discovered a method for converting a fuel tank filled with drinking water into gasoline merely by dropping a magic pill into the filler tube .
Henry Ford expressed interest in the miracle pill , but a more skeptical businessman and chemist investigated the matter .
You 'll have to read the story to learn the results ( very interesting ) , but you might be interested to know the name of that wise entrepreneur : Hudson Maxim .

The Clairvoyant Dr. Fox
Mystery stories were broadcast on radio stations in the days before television - and for quite a while after TV was available for that matter .
Families gathered around the living room radio set in excited anticipation of the next adventure of shows like " The Shadow , " " Amos ' n ' Andy , " " Tales of the Texas Rangers , " " Dragnet , " and " The Green Hornet . "
During that era , it was common also for electronics magazines , which focused largely on radio communications , to experiment with printed dramas that had a radio - centric theme .
Here is the first of a series tried by Radio - Craft in the late 1930s .
A couple decades later the Carl & Jerry adventures were run in Popular Electronics , but other than that I do n't recall seeing a lot of these things .

RFI Grows Up
According to this 1976 issue of QST magazine , in 1974 the FCC received 42,000 complaints of radio frequency interference ( RFI ) .
38,000 of them ( 90 % ) involved interference to home - entertainment devices such as stereos and TV sets .
34,000 ( 89 % ) of were found to be due to design deficiencies in the home - electronic devices themselves .
Since that time , and especially since Wi-Fi and cellphones , the potential for RFI has increased significantly .
Fortunately , thanks to much more stringent compliance testing , the likelihood of interference from a commercially produced device has been reduced , but the sheer volume of stuff spewing some level of RF energy has raised the overall noise floor in heavily populated regions around the world .
Concurrently - and also fortunately - technology advances in filtering , oscillator frequency stability , shielding , and modulation schemes ...

Quickly Assess Coax Cable Shielding Quality
Kenneth Wyatt has a good article on the EDN website entitled , " Quickly Assess Relative Coax - Cable - Shielding Quality . "
It begins : " Testing most products for radiated emissions usually requires all I/O and power cables to be attached to the equipment under test ( EUT ) and spread out in accordance with the specific product standard .
In many cases , we test engineers simply grab the nearest cables and hope for the best during the compliance test .
Unfortunately , poor - quality cables can lead to emissions failures due to poor shielding or poor shield termination ( via ' pigtails ' ) to the connectors .
In an earlier article , I related the issue of HDMI cable radiation due to shield pigtails .
I also graphically demonstrate why cable shield pigtails lead to radiated emissions in the video .
In addition to the shield pigtail issue , coax cables ... "
WWV Offers Additional Services
WWV is the oldest continuously - operating radio station in the U.S. since first going on the air from Washington , D.C. in May 1920 .
It moved around an area near D.C. for a few years before being relocated to its current location in Boulder , Colorado , in 1966 .
WWVB , another time standard transmitter , had already been established in Boulder a few years earlier .
Sister station WWVH is located in Hawaii .

Security vs. Privacy
If there ’s a debate that sums up post - 9/11 politics , it ’s security versus privacy .
Which is more important ?
How much privacy are you willing to give up for security ?
Can we even afford privacy in this age of insecurity ?
Security versus privacy :
It ’s the battle of the century , or at least its first decade .
In a Jan. 21 New Yorker article , Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell discusses a proposed plan to monitor all — that ’s right , all — internet communications for security purposes , an idea so extreme that the word “ Orwellian ” feels too mild .
The article ( now online here ) contains this passage :
In order for cyberspace to be policed , internet activity will have to be closely monitored .
Ed Giorgio , who is working with McConnell on the plan , said that would mean giving the government the authority to examine the content of any e-mail , file transfer or Web search .
“ Google has records that could help in a cyber - investigation , ” he said .
Giorgio warned me , “ We have a saying in this business : ‘ Privacy and security are a zero- sum game . ' ”
I ’m sure they have that saying in their business .
And it ’s precisely why , when people in their business are in charge of government , it becomes a police state .
If privacy and security really were a zero-sum game , we would have seen mass immigration into the former East Germany and modern - day China .
While it ’s true that police states like those have less street crime , no one argues that their citizens are fundamentally more secure .
We ’ve been told we have to trade off security and privacy so often — in debates on security versus privacy , writing contests , polls , reasoned essays and political rhetoric — that most of us do n’t even question the fundamental dichotomy .
But it ’s a false one .
Security and privacy are not opposite ends of a seesaw ; you do n’t have to accept less of one to get more of the other .
Think of a door lock , a burglar alarm and a tall fence .
Think of guns , anti-counterfeiting measures on currency and that dumb liquid ban at airports .
Security affects privacy only when it ’s based on identity , and there are limitations to that sort of approach .
Since 9/11 , approximately three things have potentially improved airline security : reinforcing the cockpit doors , passengers realizing they have to fight back and — possibly — sky marshals .
Everything else — all the security measures that affect privacy — is just security theater and a waste of effort .
By the same token , many of the anti-privacy “ security ” measures we ’re seeing — national ID cards , warrantless eavesdropping , massive data mining and so on — do little to improve , and in some cases harm , security .
And government claims of their success are either wrong , or against fake threats .
The debate is n’t security versus privacy .
It ’s liberty versus control .
You can see it in comments by government officials : “ Privacy no longer can mean anonymity , ” says Donald Kerr , principal deputy director of national intelligence .
“ Instead , it should mean that government and businesses properly safeguard people ’s private communications and financial information . ”
Did you catch that ?
You ’re expected to give up control of your privacy to others , who — presumably — get to decide how much of it you deserve .
That ’s what loss of liberty looks like .
It should be no surprise that people choose security over privacy : 51 to 29 percent in a recent poll .
Even if you do n’t subscribe to Maslow ’s hierarchy of needs , it ’s obvious that security is more important .
Security is vital to survival , not just of people but of every living thing .
Privacy is unique to humans , but it ’s a social need .
It ’s vital to personal dignity , to family life , to society — to what makes us uniquely human — but not to survival .
If you set up the false dichotomy , of course people will choose security over privacy — especially if you scare them first .
But it ’s still a false dichotomy .
There is no security without privacy .
And liberty requires both security and privacy .
The famous quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin reads : “ Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety , deserve neither liberty nor safety . ”
It ’s also true that those who would give up privacy for security are likely to end up with neither .

Item title : Introduction to the Grand Challenges for Engineering
THE big surprise , viewed from my own narrow perspective five years later , has taken place in the mysterious zones of extremist ideology .
In the months and weeks before the invasion of Iraq , I wrote quite a lot about ideology in the Middle East , and especially about the revolutionary political doctrine known as radical Islamism .
I tried to show that radical Islamism is a modern philosophy , not just a heap of medieval prejudices .
In its sundry versions , it draws on local and religious roots , just as it claims to do .
But it also draws on totalitarian inspirations from 20th - century Europe .
I wanted my readers to understand that with its double roots , religious and modern , perversely intertwined , radical Islamism wields a lot more power , intellectually speaking , than naïve observers might suppose .
I declared myself happy in principle with the notion of overthrowing Saddam Hussein , just as I was happy to see the Taliban chased from power .
But I wanted everyone to understand that military action , by itself , could never defeat an ideology like radical Islamism  could never contribute more than 10 percent ( I invented this statistic , as an illustrative figure ) to a larger solution .
I hammered away on that point in the days before the war .
And today I have to acknowledge that , for all my hammering , radical Islamism , in several of its resilient branches , the ultra-radical and the beyond - ultra- radical , has proved to be stronger even than I suggested .
A lot of people right now make the common - sense supposition that if extremist ideologies have lately entered a sort of grisly golden age , the Bush administration ’s all - too - predictable blundering in Iraq must bear the blame .
Yes , certainly ; but that ca n’t be the only explanation .
China says it has cracked a terror plot to kidnap athletes , journalists and tourists at August 's Beijing Olympics .
The security ministry said 35 arrests had been made in recent weeks and explosives seized in the north - western Xinjiang province .
It said 10 others were held when police smashed another plot based in Xinjiang back in January to disrupt the Games .
The province is home to many Muslim Uighurs , some of whom want independence in the region they call East Turkestan .
Uighur activists have accused the Chinese authorities of fabricating terror plots to crack down on the people of the region and prevent them airing legitimate grievances .
Thursday 's development was announced by a Ministry of Public Security spokesman at a news conference .
Wu Heping was quoted by AFP news agency as saying : " The violent terrorist group plotted to kidnap foreign journalists , tourists and athletes during the Beijing Olympics . "
' Suicide bombings '
Mr
Wu said two terror rings had been smashed by the authorities and that militants had planned to launch attacks to disrupt the Olympics from next month .
In recent weeks , he said , police had seized nearly 10kg ( 22lb ) of explosives and " jihadist " literature during raids in Xinjiang 's capital , Urumqi .
He said the militants had sought volunteers to carry out suicide bombings in Urumqi and other Chinese cities .
Mr
Wu also provided more details on another alleged plot , which the authorities said they had smashed last month .
He said those militants had planned to attack hotels and government offices in Beijing , Shanghai and other cities .
Poisonings and remote - control bombings were planned and 13 practice explosions had already been carried out , he said .
China said last month a plane crew had foiled a hijack attempt of a flight from Xinjiang to Beijing and two passengers had been detained .
But some observers question if China is inflating a terror threat to justify a clampdown on dissent ahead of the Olympics .
China brands the Xinjiang separatists as terrorists and has claimed more than 260 terror acts have been committed in the province over the past two decades .
Many in Xinjiang resent the recent and large - scale influx into the region of Han Chinese settlers , observers say , though there have been few reports of violence .
At the 1972 Munich Olympics , Palestinian terrorists kidnapped and killed nine Israeli athletes .
Opinion
Longshoremen to close ports on West Coast to protest war
While millions of people worldwide have marched against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and last week 's New York Times / CBS
News poll indicated that 81 percent believe the country is headed in the wrong direction - key concerns being the war and the economy - the war machine inexorably grinds on .
Amid this political atmosphere , dockworkers of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union have decided to stop work for eight hours in all U.S. West Coast ports on May 1 , International Workers '
Day , to call for an end to the war .
This decision came after an impassioned debate where the union 's Vietnam veterans turned the tide of opinion in favor of the anti-war resolution .
The motion called it an imperial action for oil in which the lives of working - class youth and Iraqi civilians were being wasted and declared May Day a " no peace , no work " holiday .
Angered after supporting Democrats who received a mandate to end the war but who now continue to fund it , longshoremen decided to exercise their political power on the docks .
Last month , in response to the union 's declaration , the Pacific Maritime Association , the West Coast employer association of shipowners , stevedore companies and terminal operators , declared its opposition to the union 's protest .
Thus , the stage is set for a conflict in the run up to the longshore contract negotiations .
The last set of contentious negotiations ( in 2002 ) took place during the period between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq .
Representatives of the Bush administration threatened that if there were any of the usual job actions during contract bargaining , then troops would occupy the docks because such actions would jeopardize " national security . "
Yet , when the PMA employers locked out the longshoremen and shut down West Coast ports for 11 days , the " security " issue vanished .
President Bush then invoked the Taft - Hartley Act , forcing longshoremen back to work under conditions favorable to the employers .
The San Francisco longshore union has a proud history of opposition to the war in Iraq , being the first union to call for an end to the war and immediate withdrawal of troops .
Representatives of the union spoke at anti-war rallies in February 2003 , including one in London attended by nearly 2 million people , the largest ever held in Britain .
Executive Board member Clarence Thomas went to Iraq with a delegation to observe workers ' rights during the occupation .
At the start of the war in Iraq , hundreds of protesters demonstrated on the Oakland docks , and longshoremen honored their picket lines .
Without warning , police in riot gear opened fire with so - called less - than - lethal weapons , shooting protesters and longshoremen alike with wooden dowels , rubber bullets , pellet bags , concussion grenades and tear gas .
A U.N. Human Rights Commission investigator characterized the Oakland police attack as " the most violent " against anti-war protesters in the United States .
And finally , last year , two black longshoremen going to work in the port of Sacramento were beaten , Maced and arrested by police under the rubric of Homeland Security regulations ordained by the " war on terror . "
There 's precedent for this action .
In the '50s , French dockworkers refused to load war materiel on ships headed for Indochina , and helped to bring that colonial war to an end .
At the ILWU 's convention in San Francisco in 2003 , A. Q. McElrath , an octogenarian University of Hawaii regent and former ILWU organizer from the pineapple canneries , challenged the delegates to act for social justice , invoking the union 's slogan , " An injury to one is an injury to all . "
She concluded , " The cudgel is on the ground .
Will you pick it up ? "
It appears that longshore workers may be doing just that on May Day and calling on immigrant workers and others to join them .
Several hundred people rallied Saturday in the city center of Prague , the capital of the Czech Republic , to voice disagreement with the planned stationing of a U.S. radar base in the country .
The demonstrators demanded a referendum on the issue and criticized the position of the coalition government over the radarbase .
The protesters unfolded the banners saying " War is the biggest business , " " No missiles are peaceful " and " Trokavec and 70 percent of Czechs want to live without the radar . "
Jan Neoral , mayor of the village of Trokavec , situated near the planned site of the radar installations , said : " We will be ruled again by corrupt and base people . "
The rally was called by the No to Bases group at Prague 's Wenceslas Square .
It was attended by trade union activists and deputy chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Bohuslav Sobotka .
Washington initiated the plan to deploy an anti-missile radar base in the Czech Republic and a missile interceptor base in Poland earlier this year .
A recent opinion poll showed that most of Czechs oppose the establishment of the base , which is to be built on the Brdy military grounds some 90 kilometers southwest of Prague .

Claim : Photograph shows Barack Obama with various members of the Obama family .
REAL PHOTOGRAPH ; INACCURATE DESCRIPTION
Origins :
The photograph displayed here is one that was circulated during the 2008 presidential campaign as a denigrative item aimed at the one of the leading contenders for the Democratic Party ’s nomination , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois :
Although the picture does include some members of Barack Obama ’s extended family , the captions added to the picture are fictitious ones created for political purposes .
Someone simply slapped a bunch of names and descriptions that have no basis in fact onto a group picture , and everyone in the photo other than Barack Obama himself is misidentified .
Several of the persons shown in this photograph are relatives and children of Senator Barack Obama ’s biological father , Barack Hussein Obama , Sr. The elder
Obama was born in Kenya and was married there , and he had children with his first wife who grew up in that country .
He later came to Hawaii to attend college and married an American woman there , and Barack Obama , Jr. is a child of that second marriage ( which ended when the junior Barack was only a year or two old ) .
Altogether , Barack Obama , Sr. fathered eight children by four different women , and Barack Jr. ’s mother also remarried and had another child with her second husband , so President Obama has quite a large extended family when half - siblings , inlaws , and step - parents are taken into account .
President Obama saw his biological father , who died in an automobile accident in 1982 , on only one occasion after his parents separated .
As far as we have been able to determine , President Obama did not meet any of the relatives shown in this photograph until he was an adult .
The persons pictured here are :
Front row ( left to right ) : Auma Obama ( Barack ’s half - sister ) , Kezia Obama ( Auma ’s mother ) , Sarah Hussein Onyango Obama ( the third wife of Barack ’s paternal grandfather ) , Zeituni Onyango ( Barack ’s aunt ) .
Back row ( left to right ) : Sayid Obama ( Barack ’s uncle ) , Barack Obama , Abongo [ Roy ] Obama ( Barack ’s half - brother ) , unidentified woman , Bernard Obama ( Barack ’s half - brother ) , Abo Obama ( Barack ’s half - brother ) .

The natural proclivities of government are about concentrating the benefits ( of government activity ) in the hands of small groups in the short run and dispersing the costs over the populace in the long run .
In short , government is about spending now and paying later .
These proclivities manifest themselves in a very interesting way in the US budget .
Every year , there are two types of spending in the US budget : discretionary and mandatory ( the distinction is a bit strange for those not accustomed to public accounting because that distinction is really a convention and nothing more : elected officials in Congress have the power to revoke any law they want including Medicaid which is part of mandatory spending ) .
Every year , the US President submits his budget to Congress in February and by October the budget is voted .
During that period , more spending can take place as part of the current fiscal year ( whereas the budget under discussion is for the next one ) ; this is what is called supplemental spending .
For decades , supplemental spending represented only a very small fraction of the total budget ( around 1 % ) .
Supplementals were justified because of new spending that the Federal government had to incur and had not been accounted for in advance .
In the last decade however , things have changed .
More and more spending is qualified as supplemental ( and in general “ emergency ” as well although emergency spending is not necessarily part of supplemental and supplemental can be non-emergency ) .
In a very good Mercatus Policy Series paper ( see The Never - Ending Emergency ) , Veronique de Rugy explains why this is happening .
Her take is that the US government faces lots of perverse incentives and as a result , spends more and more money outside the initial budget .
Supplemental appropriations currently represent more than $ 100 billion a year and there are already supplemental in discussion for FY08 and FY09 that would be in the order of $ 178 billion ( and yes it is unusual to have supplemental for the coming FY ) .
Just yesterday , House Democratic leaders were looking to add $ 3 to $ 4 billion in domestic spending to the emergency war supplemental beyond economic stimulus and troop - related funds .
That spending comes on top of $ 12 billion for both 13 extra weeks of unemployment benefits for those whose eligibility has expired and a boost in GI education spending that has broad , bipartisan support .
Supplementals are not part of budget caps and deficit accounting , rules that are supposed to constrain the natural proclivities of government .
Supplemental enables agencies to get more funds without having to make difficult tradeoffs since these moneys are not voted as part of the general funds .
Supplementals are akin to “ off - balance sheet accounting , ” which is why all this is ironical .
Private entrepreneurs have gone to jail for not revealing unfunded liabilities and doing various accounting gimmicks .
However , legislatures can vote unsustainable budgets based on weird accounting rules because they make the rules and have the power to print money ( and to tax of course but even that power is becoming less and less useful ) .
The natural proclivities of government have no limits ( I came across another interesting example recently and I ’ll post something about it soon ) .
It is frightening and the consequences could be lethal for Americans .
Read Veronique ’s piece , it is well - worth the read , as it is the best work available on the subject .

A little background : The AAA was once known as the American Automobile Association .
In the first half of the 20th century it was the pre-eminent spokesman and advocate of American motorists .
The American Automobile Association championed more and better roads , rational traffic laws and fair enforcement .
It even identified and campaigned against speed traps .
Not remembered by many ; it was the principle sanctioning body for auto races .
By the 1960 ’s the American Automobile Association was well into its transition from motorist advocate to insurance company .
The association had a long history with roadside assistance , a type of insurance , but not until the 60’s and 70’s did the insurance function begin to dominate its priorities .
The insurance role evolved to total control in the 1980 ’s and 1990’s .
Eventually the facade of being a motorist advocacy organization collapsed and the name was changed to “ AAA , ” the letters meaning whatever the observer assumed them to mean .
In the era when AAA was championing the 55 MPH speed limit ( like all other insurance companies ) the interpretations were not complimentary .
That , abruptly , brings us to the AAA press release that hit the media yesterday .
I should add , there are still a fair number of reporters and other media mavens that have not caught on to the fact that the AAA is not the American Automobile Association of old .
The press release claims that auto accidents are costing we naïve citizens a lot more money than is traffic congestion and yet the government seems much more focused on traffic congestion than it is on traffic safety .
This is one of those instances where because they said it , it must be true .
In reality , it ’s unvarnished nonsense .
First , the claim that auto accidents are costing society more money than congestion is based on “ funny money ” assumptions , made up costs , and “ apples and oranges ” comparisons .
Assumptions on the value of one person ’s life , work place losses , and monetizing “ quality of life ” or “ pain and suffering ” are futile subjective exercises intended to prove a point , not to shed light .
Yes , there are 43,000 annual traffic related fatalities , but why not mention that the fatality rate , a more meaningful statistic , has dropped like a stone over the past three decades ?
Simple .
Positive news does n’t support the insurance industry ’s agenda .
Assuming that 75 percent of the population lives in urban / suburban / developed regions means that 225 million people , including 150 million drivers deal with some level of congestion on a daily basis .
If it costs each person an hour each work day that ’s 58 billion man hours lost to congestion .
OK , only a half hour ; 29 billion man hours a year .
At $ 7 per hour that ’s $ 203 billion dollars a year and we have n’t even started with “ quality of life ” or workplace losses .
If these seem like silly numbers to you I ’d argue that they are n’t any sillier than saying every life lost in an auto accident cost $ 3,249,192.00 ( they apparently rounded off the cents ) .
Barbara Harsha , Exec. Dir. of the Governors Highway Safety Association unintentionally stated a fact ; “ Traffic Accidents happen in ones and twos , and people see them as random events that do n’t effect them . ”
Actually “ the people ” have it about right .
For most of them , traffic accidents are random events that do not affect them in a significant manner if they are not directly involved in the accident , which is usually the case .
Yes , there are auto insurance rates , but those rates largely track inflation and are driven by administrative costs and property damage claims .
Besides , when is the last time you heard about an auto insurance company being unprofitable ?
Congestion is not a random event ; motorists confront it almost every day they travel .
It costs them time , makes them late , aggravates and irritates ( probably causes plenty of heart attacks and strokes ) , increases fuel consumption , emissions , and vehicle wear and tear , and it causes accidents .
It stands to reason that funds garnered by taxing motorists should be used to improve roadways and lessen congestion .
Suggesting that safety has been shorted resources or given a low priority is sheer political nonsense .
No single government action has done more to improve highway safety than the construction and the expansion of the Interstate System .
Without these and similar limited access divided highways we would experience twice as many fatalities , if not more , than we do today .
The vast preponderance of traffic accidents are not caused by speeding , impairment , senior drivers , or being young .
They are caused by distraction , inattention , and fatigue .
Passing more laws , heaping on more penalties , or hiring platoons of cops will not address these factors .
If the resources that are wasted on speed traps , ticket cameras , roadblocks , enforcement binges , and propaganda , like this study , were invested in real research , programs , and projects that addressed the real causes of most traffic accidents we might just be able to make progress toward safer AND less congested highways .
Editor 's Introductory Note :
Our planet has been slowly warming since last emerging from the " Little Ice Age " of the 17th century , often associated with the Maunder Minimum .
Before that came the " Medieval Warm Period " , in which temperatures were about the same as they are today .
Both of these climate phenomena are known to have occurred in the Northern Hemisphere , but several hundred years prior to the present , the majority of the Southern Hemisphere was primarily populated by indigenous peoples , where science and scientific observation was limited to non-existent .
Thus we can not say that these periods were necessarily " global " .
However , " Global Warming " in recent historical times has been an undisputable fact , and no one can reasonably deny that .
But we 're hearing far too often that the " science " is " settled " , and that it is mankind 's contribution to the natural CO2 in the atmosphere has been the principal cause of an increasing " Greenhouse Effect " , which is the root " cause " of global warming .
We 're also hearing that " all the world 's scientists now agree on this settled science " , and it is now time to quickly and most radically alter our culture , and prevent a looming global catastrophe .
And last , but not least , we 're seeing a sort of mass hysteria sweeping our culture which is really quite disturbing .
Historians ponder how the entire nation of Germany could possibly have goose - stepped into place in such a short time , and we have similar unrest .
Have we become a nation of overnight loonies ?
Sorry folks , but we 're not exactly buying into the Global Hysteria just yet .
We know a great deal about atmospheric physics , ( bio ) and from the onset , many of the claims were just plain fishy .
The extreme haste with which seemingly the entire world immediately accepted the idea of Anthropogenic ( man-made ) Global Warming made us more than a little bit suspicious that no one had really taken a close look at the science .
We also knew that the catch - all activity today known as " Climate Science " was in its infancy , and that atmospheric modeling did not and still does not exist which can predict changes in the weather or climate more than about a day or two in advance .
So the endless stream of dire predictions of what was going to happen years or decades from now if we did not drastically reduce our CO2 production by virtually shutting down the economies of the world appeared to be more the product of radical political and environmental activism rather than science .
Thus , we embarked on a personal quest for more information , armed with a strong academic background in postgraduate physics and a good understanding of the advanced mathematics necessary in such a pursuit .
This fundamental knowledge of the core principles of matter and its many exceptionally complex interactions allowed us to research and understand the foundations of many other sciences .
In short , we read complex scientific articles in many other scientific disciplines with relative ease and good understanding - like most folks read comic books .
As our own knowledge of " climate science " grew , so grew our doubts over the " settled science " .
What we found was the science was far from " settled " .. in fact it was barely underway .
It was for a while a somewhat lonely quest , what with " all the world 's scientists " apparently having no doubt .
Finally , in December 2007 we submitted an article to one of our local newspapers , the Addison Independent , thinking they would be delighted in having at minimum an alternative view of the issue .
Alas , they chose not to publish it , but two weeks after our submission ( by the strangest coincidence ) , published yet another " pro-global - warming " feature written by an individual whom , to the best we could determine , had no advanced training in any science at all , beyond self - taught it would appear .
Still , the individual had published a number of popular books on popular environmental issues , was well - loved by those of similar political bent , and was held in high esteem among his peers .
We had learned a valuable lesson : Popular Journalists trump coupled sets of 2nd - order partial differential equations every time .
Serious science does n't matter if you have the press in your pocket .
In fairness to the Addison Independent and its editors , our article was somewhat lengthy and technical , and presumably the average reader most likely could not follow or even be interested in an alternative viewpoint , since everyone knew by now that the global warming issue was " settled science " .
And we confess that we like the paper , subscribe to it , and know a number of folks who work there personally .
They 're all good folks , and they have every right to choose what does or does n't go in their publication .
They also have a right to spin the news any direction they choose , because that 's what freedom of the press is all about .
Seems everyone , both left and right , does it - and it's almost certain we will be accused of doing the same here .
And we just may be , as hard as we may try to avoid it .
We humans are n't all shaped by the same cookie cutter , and that 's a blessing that has taken us as a species to the top of the food chain .
But by then we had been sharing our own independent research of the literature with others via email , and receiving a surprising amount of agreement back in return .
( We 're in contact with a large number of fellow scientists around the country , dating back to our college days in the 17th century when beer was a quarter a bottle ) .
One local friend , in particular , kept pressing us to publish , and even offered to set up a " debate " with the Popular Journalist who had usurped our original article .
This we politely declined , arguing that " debate " cannot prove or disprove science ... science must stand on its own .
But then something unusual happened .
On Dec. 13 , 2007 , 100 scientists jointly signed an Open Letter to Ban Ki-Moon , Secretary - General of the United Nations , requesting they cease the man-made global warming hysteria and settle down to helping mankind better prepare for natural disasters .
The final signature was from the President of the World Federation of Scientists .
At last , we were not alone ...
We decided to publish the results of our counter - exploration on the internet - but in a somewhat uniquely different fashion .
Knowing that most folks are n't geeks , and may have little understanding of science or math , we 're going to attempt to teach some of the essential physics and such as we go along .
Readers with little or no mathematical or scientific training may find it challenging , but if you have a general understanding of introductory college or even solid high school level chemistry or physics , you should have no problem in following this amazing tale .
The brighter readers , even without a science background , should be able to follow , as well .
Smart folks learn faster than most .
What follows is a tale gleaned from many sources over what turned out to be an unreasonably long period of time .
We 'll be first examining a " worst case " scenario , using very simple math at first , in order to arrive in a ballpark that will tell us if we need to go further and pull out long strings of complicated equations , which we do n't want to have to resort to because we 're writing for the average layman who is not a rocket scientist .
This is a valid scientific method despite its apparent simplicity , for if one can first determine that a person does not own a motorcycle , then you do n't have to spend a lot of time calculating how likely he is to crash while riding it .
Reducing it to the simplest of terms for the average person to understand was a daunting task .
Below is an example of what " real " Climate Scientists have to deal with on a daily basis .
Is it any wonder that the most popular majors in college are liberal arts ?
Snipped from an article entitled
Solar - Cycle Warming at the Earths Surface and an Observational Determination of Climate Sensitivity .
By Ka-Kit Tung and Charles D. Camp
Department of Applied Mathematics
University of Washington , Seattle Washington
Let 's take a short glance at the equation at the left , because you 're never going to see anything like it again in this editorial .
To most of you , it is gobbly - gook , but to a physicist , it is part of a mathematical proof accompanying a particular study done on the sun 's role in Global Warming .
What the authors are explaining is they have found that the total solar irradiance ( TSI ) has been measured by orbiting satellites since 1978 and it varies on an 11 - year cycle by about 0.07 % .
So , from solar min to solar max , the TSI reaching the earths surface increases at a rate comparable to the radiative heating due to a 1 % per year increase in greenhouse gases , and will probably add , during the next five to six years in the advancing phase of Solar Cycle 24 , almost 0.2 °K to the globally - averaged temperature , thus doubling the amount of transient global warming expected from greenhouse warming alone .
Whew ....
Do n't fret - neither Al Gore nor any of the Popular Journalists can understand it either .
We 'll try to reference most of the material , but if we miss a credit , or use a photograph someone did n't want to share with the world ( OK , we wonder why the photo was on the web if that were the case ) we 'll quickly remove it with our apologies .
And let 's freely admit up front that what we offer here is a dissenting opinion , and surely we have " cherry - picked " the articles of others which are also contrary to the widely held current beliefs .
A bit of this is original on our part , but most of it comes from others around the globe .
We have tried to present work from what we believe to be credible , thoroughly diligent scientists actively engaged in current research .
Let 's get started :
We 're reminded of an earlier story , which happened back in 1912 .
This was the amazing discovery of a skull and jawbone in which was quickly named the Piltdown Man and which all the world 's archaeologists immediately accepted as a hitherto unknown form of early human .
It appears no one bothered to examine it closely , assuming that other scientists had thoroughly investigated and vetted it .
The hoax was n't uncovered until 1953 , when it was learned that the skull was that of a modern man and the jaw that of an orangutan .
Seems no one had ever bothered to take a really close look at the artifact .
Well , folks , it does appear we have a new , 21st Century Piltdown Man , and this time we know his name .
He 's called " Anthropogenic Global Warming "
It 's hard to nail down exactly when the sky started falling , but certainly the work of Michael Mann provided its first global exposure .
Michael Mann , a paleoclimatologist ( one who attempts to interpret the past climate through certain Paleolithic records , such as ice core samples , sea bed sediments , coral heads , and tree ring growth ) , submitted a paper to Nature magazine in 1998 which , unfortunately , was not subjected to peer review before publication .
In it , he offered what has now become known as the famous " hockey stick " chart , showing the earth 's temperature having been relatively constant for the past thousand years before suddenly skyrocketing upward at the dawn of the 20th century .
His interpretation was that man 's production of CO 2 in the modern age was obviously responsible for the sudden increase .
It turned out to be one of the biggest scientific blunders of all time .
Look carefully at the chart above , which is the famous " hockey stick " chart .
Note the horizontal scale is in years , stretching from the year 1000 to the near present time .
The vertical scale is in degrees Centigrade , and note carefully that it is graded in increments of 1/10 of a degree .
That means the wiggly blue section in the middle is actually only varying up and down by about a half of a degree .
The baseline , as noted , is set at the average of the recorded temperatures from 1961 to 1990 .
Also note that only the red portion represents actual measured temperatures - the rest is based on the assumption that one can interpret past temperatures from examining ancient tree rings or ice core samples from centuries - old ice locked in glaciers .
This is , at best , a marriage of apples and oranges - the handle being somewhat of an educated guess , and the blade being based on actual measurements using thermometric recording devices .
Sort of like pairing the skull of a human with the jawbone of an orangutan .
And finally , note that the chart is for the northern hemisphere only .
This chart , unfortunately , became the foundation for the first report of the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which in turn provided the summary information and recommendations to the world 's governments .
The Anthropogenic Global Warming panic was off to a rocketing start .
However , some folks noticed a couple of significant and fairly well accepted climatological history facts to be conspicuously missing .
The first was the well - documented " Medieval Warm Period " where temperatures , at least in Europe as mentioned in our introduction , were significantly higher .
The second was the " Little Ice Age " , a period in which the temperatures dropped so low the Thames River in London froze over .
How could this be an accurate record of the last millennium ?
Let 's pause and mention that the data above is not " raw " data .
Dr. Mann actually used about 70 - 80 data sets , and in each set he applied a mathematical analysis known as a principle component analysis ( PCA ) which seeks to extract principal , or significant component information from a widely varying set of raw data .
Along comes Steve McIntyre , a Canadian analyst , who spends two years of his own personal time reverse - engineering Dr. Mann 's PCA program .
McIntyre subjects Mann 's PCA program to a " Monte Carlo " analysis - which inserts random data sets into the function - and discovered that no matter what data he fed it , the result was always the same .
The arm of the " hockey stick " ( paleo - record ) always came out straight .
In Dr. Mann 's case , the rising temperature of the Medieval Warm Period and the expected trough of the Little Ice Age had been completely erased .
The hockey stick was broken .
Fini . Kaput .
We may never know whether Mann 's work was deliberately contrived to fit some personal environmental agenda , or just a colossal mathematical blunder .
McIntyre submitted his work to Nature Magazine - since they were responsible for publishing Mann 's flawed research without peer review in the first place , but they reportedly rejected it , saying it was " too long " .
He then shortened it to 500 words , and re-submitted it , but again it was rejected , this time saying it was " too mathematical " or words to that effect .
Heaven forbid any publication calling itself an " International Weekly Journal of Science " from actually publishing any science that hinged on mathematics .
Let 's all push a yard stick into the snow , measure the snow depth , call ourselves " climate scientists " , and get published in Nature .
In the end , McIntyre turned to the internet and its true freedom of the press , and today he is known to every serious climate scientist on the planet as the man who broke the hockey stick .
The National Academy of Sciences has found Mann 's graph to have a validation skill not significantly different from zero  i.e. , the graph was useless .
Note the corrected version , below , in which neither today 's temperatures nor the rate of warming are particularly unusual compared to the historical record .
Thus , even the " global warming " of the 20th century was not even remotely a cause for the slightest alarm .
It was all " much to do about nothing " .
The Medieval Warm Period , of which the proponents of Anthropogenic Global Warming do n't want you to be aware , was a period in which agriculture flourished , helping Europe emerge from the Dark Ages .
The Little Ice Age produced crop failures from too - short growing seasons leading to widespread hunger and even starvation in some more northern locales .
Since our emergence from the Little Ice Age , agriculture has again flourished , and most of us hope it lasts quite a while longer .
This is certainly no cause for panic , and a few of us think being comfortably warm and having plenty to eat is actually good .
And Tom Nelson has a few more graphs the AGW folks do n't want you to see posted HERE .
Into the Laboratory , it 's time to go to work .
Next , let 's take a look CO2 from an Atmospheric Physicist 's view - straightforward physics that we hope most of you will be able to follow :
What we commonly call " light " is actually electromagnetic radiation , physically no different from radio waves , except of different frequencies and wavelengths .
The part we can see is called the visible spectrum .
Beyond what we can see in the higher frequencies ( and shorter wavelengths , since they are reciprocal functions ) lies the ultraviolet spectrum .
UV light is very penetrating , which is why one could get sunburned on an overcast day .
Beyond even that are X - rays , which can penetrate much deeper .
On the opposite end of the visible spectrum lies infra-red ... which you can't see , but you can easily feel , as anyone who has warmed his hands near a hot stove can testify .
It is the infrared portion we commonly refer to as " heat " radiation .
And beyond that are the radio and television wavelengths we all know and love .
The sun is very " bright " , and its frequency spectrum is generally too short to produce much infrared coming down through the atmosphere .
Radiation from the sun penetrates the atmosphere , strikes the earth , and some of it is absorbed and some is reflected .
The different bandwidths ( colors ) of reflected light depend on the material struck , so something green - colored is reflecting the green portion of the visible spectrum and absorbing the rest .
This heats up the earth , and that 's the first part of the story .
All heated bodies emit radiation in the infrared range .
This is called " black body " radiation , because a perfectly black body reflects no visible light but still emits radiation in a specified band of wavelengths .
Infrared radiation is of a much longer wavelength , and can be much easier absorbed by certain components in the atmosphere , causing them to also " heat up " .
The warm air around us is being kept warm partially from black body radiation coming from the earth itself .
Another method of warming is by conduction - air coming in contact with the heated soil , rocks , trees , buildings , etc. and being directly warmed by that contact .
This may be a bigger factor than we think , but we 're not going to attempt to try to determine just how much that might be .
We 'd have to know the total surface area of every object - down to the smallest blade of grass - there is on our planet .
We also need to remind ourselves that there is actually no physical quantity known as " cold " .
There is only " heat " and " lack of heat " .
Next , lets talk about a scientific process called Atomic Absorption Spectrometry .
It is a method by which we can measure precisely which wavelengths of radiation a particular gas is capable of absorbing .
In our highly simplified drawing above , a radiation source is beamed through a glass container containing a gas sample .
As the radiation passes through , a portion of it is absorbed at particular narrow bandwidths ( often more than one ) so the end result are some " missing " sections of the whole spectrum coming from the source , which show up as dark lines .
They 're missing because they were absorbed by the sample in the chamber .
They are called absorption lines , or absorption spectra , and when analyzed by a knowledgeable person , can tell one what the gas or gas mixture is in the sample chamber based on a catalog of known spectra .
It 's a wonderful tool for analyzing unknown gas samples .
Let 's look at a real result , below - the absorption spectrum for pure carbon dioxide plus an amount of water vapor equal to that in our current atmosphere as the sample and infrared radiation from a black body spectrum as the source .
This is part of the so - called " greenhouse effect "
As we can see above , carbon dioxide absorbs infrared radiation ( IR ) in only three narrow bands of frequencies , which correspond to wavelengths of 2.7 , 4.3 and 15 micrometers ( µm ) , respectively .
The percentage absorption of all three lines combined can be very generously estimated at about 8 % of the whole IR spectrum , which means that 92 % of the " heat " passes right through without being absorbed by CO2 .
In reality , the two smaller peaks do n't account for much , since they lie in an energy range that is much smaller than the where the 15 micron peak sits - so 4 % or 5 % might be closer to reality .
If the entire atmosphere were composed of nothing but CO2 , i.e. , was pure CO2 and nothing else , it would still only be able to absorb no more than 8 % of the heat radiating from the earth .
Note :
In our original draft , we talked a bit about relative spacing geometry , to give the reader a feel for the distance between molecules in the atmosphere .
We talked in ( very crude ) terms about tacking bottle caps up on a barn wall , and gave some spacing examples in 2 dimensions for a rough feel of the subject .
One of our readers , Peter J. Morgan - a consulting engineer from New Zealand - undertook to re-write our simple ( and not technically accurate ) description for his 15 year old son .
He was kind enough to send it to us , and we liked it so much we threw out our South Park estimate and substituted his work instead .
Thanks ,
Peter !
To give you a feeling for how little CO 2 there actually is in the atmosphere , let 's note that atoms and molecules are very tiny things , and the distances between them are therefore also very small .
Physicists like to use a unit of measure called an Angstrom , which is 0.1 of a nano - meter , or a 0.1 billionth of a meter , ( i.e. 10 - 10 of a meter or 10 - 7 of a mm ) .
A molecule like CO 2 has a size of around two Angstroms ( 2 x 10 - 7 mm ) .
The density of the gas is 10 to the 24th power number of molecules occupying a space of about 22 liters ( i.e. 4.55 x 1022 molecules per liter ) at a pressure of 760 mm of mercury and 273 degrees Kelvin ( i.e. 32 degrees Fahrenheit or zero degrees Celsius )  called the " standard temperature and pressure " .
You can almost think of all this as just the normal temperature and pressure around you right now .
A simple calculation shows that in a 3 - dimensional tetrahedron array , as shown in the diagram below ( for the closest possible packing with an equal distance between molecules ) , the spacing between molecules is approximately 28 Angstroms .
For equidistant packing , a tetrahedron arrangement is required To fit 4.55 x 1022 molecules equispaced in a 100 - mm cube ( i.e. one liter ) they have to be 28 Angstroms apart .
Since at 2 x 10 - 7 mm diameter , CO 2 is a very tiny molecule , let 's magnify the picture by a factor of 10 million , so that we can imagine a CO 2 molecule as a 20 mm diameter marble floating in the air .
However , CO 2 makes up only 380 of each million molecules of air  the rest are a mixture of all the other atmospheric gases and water vapor  i.e. only one in every 2632 molecules is a CO 2 molecule .
Let s imagine that all the other molecules are colored blue , and CO 2 molecules are colored red .
All the marbles making up our model atmosphere are equispaced at 280 mm apart .
When mixed evenly into our model atmosphere ( which is what the wind does ) a bit more simple math shows that our red marbles are equispaced at 3900 mm ( i.e. 3.9 meters ) apart .
In the real atmosphere , at a height of approx .
5500 meters , pressure is halved from what it is at sea level .
A bit more simple math shows that at a height of 5500 meters ( 55 million kilometers in our model  that s 143 times the distance from earth to the moon ! ) , our 20 mm diameter CO 2 marbles are equispaced at 4.9 meters apart .
Now you know why CO 2 is called a trace gas .
This whole picture we have drawn ( with Peter Morgan 's help ) illustrates both how little CO2 there is in the atmosphere , and how relatively little of the radiation it is capable of absorbing and " heating " the atmosphere .
We know that most of the other IR radiation bands slips through and does n't get to do any heating at all .
( We 've all seen the nice IR photographs taken from the space station . )
But some scientists such as Dr. Heinz
Hug who specialize in study of this stuff claims that all of the heat in these particular spectra are indeed absorbed in a relatively short distance , so adding more CO2 to the atmosphere can't affect anything at any rate .
Other scientists , such as Dr. Roy W. Spencer at NASA - and one of the leading experts in the field of climate science - does n't completely agree
We 've decided to be exceptionally generous to all concerned in the debate and look at the worst - case scenario , where we 'll say that all of the available heat in the CO2 absorption spectrum is actually captured .
We know that man is responsible for about 3 % of it , so with the simplest of math , we have .03 x .08 = .0024 .
And remember that 8 % figure was actually larger than reality , since the two side peaks do n't have much energy to capture .
Man -made CO2 does n't appear physically capable of absorbing much more than
two - thousandths of the radiated heat ( IR ) passing upward through the atmosphere .
And , if all of the available heat in that spectrum is indeed being captured by the current CO2 levels before leaving the atmosphere , then adding more CO2 to the atmosphere wo n't matter a bit .
In short , the laws of physics do n't seem to allow CO2 it 's currently assumed place as a significant " greenhouse gas " based on present concentrations .
The other " greenhouse gases " such as methane , nitrous oxide , tetrafluoromethane , hexafluoroethane , sulfur hexafluoride , trifluoromethane , 1,1,1,2 - tetrafluoroethane , and 1,1 - difluoroethane exist only in extraordinarily smaller amounts and are n't even up for serious discussion by any segment of the scientific community .
And , since the other components of the atmosphere ( oxygen , nitrogen , and water vapor ) are n't materially affected by human activity , the " greenhouse effect " is essentially a totally natural phenomenon , unaffected by human activity .
We could repeat the spectral analysis and calculations for Oxygen , or O 2 ( The percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere remains exactly the same at all heights up to about 85 km , and is about 20.9 % by volume ) and Nitrogen ( N 2 ) which is the whopper at 78.1 % - but we wo n't .
We 'll leave that as your homework problem now that you know how to do it .
Just look up the atomic absorption spectra for both , and do the math .
You 'll discover that Oxygen and Nitrogen are n't even " greenhouse gases " , so that leaves the principal greenhouse gas ... you guessed it ....
Water Vapor .
Curiously enough , the UN IPCC reports do n't even mention water vapor , since it is technically not a " gas " in the atmosphere .
Dr. Roy W. Spencer has one of the best comments we 've read on this subject :
" Al Gore likes to say that mankind puts 70 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every day .
What he probably does n't know is that mother nature puts 24,000 times that amount of our main greenhouse gas -- water vapor -- into the atmosphere every day , and removes about the same amount every day .
While this does not ' prove ' that global warming is not manmade , it shows that weather systems have by far the greatest control over the Earth 's greenhouse effect , which is dominated by water vapor and clouds . "
We can safely ballpark water vapor as being responsible for more than 95 % of all the greenhouse effect , with oxygen and nitrogen playing no role and carbon dioxide being relatively insignificant ... particularly the even smaller human - produced part .
Side note : Both Oxygen and Nitrogen do n't like to live alone .
They prefer to find another and stick together into a diatomic ( 2 atom ) molecule .
Thus the molecular weight of atmospheric oxygen or nitrogen is approximately twice that of one of them alone .
We say " approximately " , because it takes energy to bind them together , and mass and energy are equivalent stuff , as our good friend Dr. Einstein explained with his famous equation E=MC2 .
Now , you can sit back and give yourself a pat on the back , because you now know more pure physics of the atmosphere than a lot of so - called " climate scientists " , and likely know more than almost all of the non-scientist Popular Journalists and other writers churning out panic - stricken books and newspaper articles on the subject .
And for sure , you now know a lot more than Al Gore .
One would think this would be the end of the discussion , that the laws of physics show us that CO 2 is n't even a significant " greenhouse gas " and certainly the human contribution is insignificant .
We both now know that CO 2 can't possibly be the evil byproduct all the ballyhoo has been claiming , and in fact , our biologist friends tell us if we could increase the CO 2 content a little more , the planet would be much the richer ... because plants love it , grow much larger with more of it , and we all like to eat .
CO 2 is a non-toxic , non-polluting , earth - friendly component that really is critical to our survival .
Maybe that 's why we laughed so hard when the Popular Journalist in the Addison Independent insisted that 340 , rather than 380 parts per million CO 2 was a " target " we should all shoot for .
While you 're pulling rabbits out of a hat , could you please bring me a Pepsi ?
OK , if you still are compelled to worry about something , think about this :
The amount of oxygen in our atmosphere is slowly diminishing .
A very long time ago , it was as much as 35 % of the atmosphere , and has been shrinking ever since .
We always wondered why those plant - eating eating dinosaurs had such long necks , and now we know - they had to reach up for dinner into the really tall trees that once dotted our oxygen - rich planet .
But let 's not worry about that just now , for this current story is far from over .
If you 've read this far , you 're likely more curious than most , and probably more intelligent than average .
And you probably want to know exactly what is causing the warming and cooling periods on the planet which have been going on for millennia .
Inquiring minds want to know this stuff .
Let 's break for a minute , and point out that " Climate Science " is a catch - all term , like " Sports " .
The fellow who takes a daily temperature reading or measures the snow depth with a stick could call himself a " Climate Scientist " as much as the person tending the boiler in the basement could call himself a " Stationary Engineer " .
Earth 's climate is an enormously complex subject , spanning not only the " pure " sciences like physics and chemistry , but many of the " natural sciences " , such as oceanography , meteorology , volcanology , paleontology , archeology , solar science , and many others .
All scientists are n't of the same quality , intellect , or natural talent for the trade .
Sloppy scientists are as common as bad mechanics .
At the top of the pecking order of knowledge needs sit the fundamental laws of physics - for no matter what others may determine , the final results must obey the fundamental , established principles which determine the nature of all elemental matter .
Unfortunately , many " environmental scientists " actually study very little physics , chemistry or biology in depth .
And many of the " lower " sciences involve little mathematics beyond introductory calculus .
Before the greater body of scientists out there start beating on us , we 'll admit that very few physicists had a time slot to study organic chemistry and beyond in college - and the truth of the matter is , there are n't enough semester hours available for everyone to be cross - trained in other disciplines to any competent depth .
This makes becoming a highly skilled " Climate Scientist " very challenging , for this extremely complex field requires a very large tool kit .
Thus , we trust others to deliver meaningful results from their specific disciplines .
If a geologist tells us a particular rock is from the Devonian Period , we have little choice but to believe him .
So in what follows , we 're going to have to trust we have chosen good , solid scientists from other disciplines as our guide .
In reading " scientific articles " one must also be very alert to use of the word " if " .
This is the killer word - the Colt .45 of sloppy or even deliberately misleading science .
" If " the sea level rises 40 feet , then certainly most of Manhattan will be flooded .
" If " the moon falls on Kansas , then certainly wheat prices are going to soar out of site .
Within a sentence or two , " if " morphs into " when " and soon everyone is convinced that the moon is absolutely going to fall on Kansas , it 's just a matter of time , we 're all doomed ... unless we take immediate action to stop it .
But neither of these are very likely to happen , as we shall soon see .
After the hockey stick was accepted virtually overnight without close examination ( like the Piltdown Man ) , along comes Al Gore , a long - time " environmentalist " , ( who made near - failing grades in science and math in college ) who decides to make a movie out of it .
The hockey stick goes up on the big screen , and Gore boards a mechanical lift with cameras grinding , pointer in hand as he rises in unison with the blade of the stick which starts growing upward toward the ceiling .
No longer are we talking about tenths of a degree , the temperature is rising like a puff pastry , and headed toward the attic .
It all began with the word " if " .
If the hockey stick tip continues to rise ( lift starts going upward , the audience holds its breath ) then ... and along comes computer animations of New York flooding , Florida underwater , and poor little Polar Bears struggling to board the last piece of ice floating in the open Arctic Sea . ( sigh ...)
It ends with Hurricane Katrina and Boston almost losing the pennant .
It is Hollywood at its finest , and the Deacons of La La Land give it an Oscar .
Even the Nobel Committee is impressed , gives it two thumbs - up and a Nobel Prize to Gore and the other members of the IPCC for the many lives that will be saved in the future because of this brilliant early warning .
And , there 's still time for we miserable humans to " save " the planet by buying " carbon offsets " accomplished best by investing in Al Gore 's British company which buys stock in other companies that will benefit from a world - wide global warming hysteria ( keeping a healthy cut ) and making , perhaps , Al Gore the richest former Vice President in history .
That will buy a lot of SUV's , jets , and large mansions with mega-electric bills .
Everyone wins except the taxpayer and businessman , who are soon to pay a very heavy price .
So what 's really causing the endless cycles of warming and cooling , if it is n't a constantly changing " Greenhouse Effect " - with man to blame ?
Man was n't producing much CO 2 in the past million years , so he has n't simply been turning the greenhouse up and down at will .
Just look up - one of the most likely culprits is our old friend , the Sun.
Canadian climatologist Tim Patterson says the sun drives the earth 's climate changes and Earth 's current global warming is a direct result of a long , moderate 1,500 - year cycle in the sun 's irradiance .
Patterson says he learned of the 1,500 - year climate cycle while studying cycles in fish numbers on Canada 's West Coast .
Since the Canadian
West had no long - term written fishery records , Patterson 's research team drilled sediment cores in the deep local fjords to get 5,000 - year climate profiles from the mud .
The mud showed the past climate conditions :
Warm summers left layers thick with one - celled fossils and fish scales .
Cold , wet periods showed dark sediments , mostly dirt washed from the surrounding land .
Patterson 's fishing profiles clearly revealed the sun's 87 and 210 - year solar cyclesand the longer , 1500 - year Dansgaard - Oeschger cycles found since the 1980s in ice cores , tree rings , and fossil pollen .
" Even though the sun is brighter now than at any time in the past 8,000 years , the increase in direct solar input is not calculated to be sufficient to cause the past century 's modest warming on its own .
There had to be an amplifier of some sort for the sun to be a primary driver of climate changes .
Indeed , that is precisely what has been discovered , " says Patterson .
" In a series of groundbreaking scientific papers starting in 2000 , Vizer , Shaviv , Carslaw and most recently Svensmark et al. , have collectively demonstrated that as the output of the sun varies ... varying amounts of galactic cosmic rays from deep space are able to enter our solar system ...
These cosmic rays enhance cloud formation , which , overall , has a cooling effect on the planet . "
" When the sun is less bright , more cosmic rays are able to get through to Earth 's atmosphere , more clouds form and the planet cools ...
This is precisely what happened from the middle of the 17th century into the early 18th century , when the solar energy input to our atmosphere ... was at a minimum and the planet was stuck in the Little Ice Age . "
The Canadian expert concludes , " CO 2 variations show little correlation with our planet 's climate on long , medium and even short time scales .
Instead , Earth 's sea surface temperatures show a massive 95 percent lagged correlation with the sunspot index . "
We 'll talk about what a " correlation " means in a couple of minutes .
So what does this all mean ?
It means , in the simplest of terms , that it is the Sun which is warming the oceans , not an increased " Greenhouse Effect " caused by human activity .
And , it might appear that Mother Earth is not the only one suffering from the Sun 's effect .
Data from NASAs Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey mission in 2005 disclosed that the carbon dioxide " ice caps  near Mars south pole had been shrinking for three consecutive summers .
Mmmm ...
We could go on for endless pages on solar science and the sun 's relationship to global warming , but we 're not going to do that .
One of the best summary articles we 've found in simple layman terms is by Kevin Roeten , and you can read more on that by clicking HERE .
The current warming Solar Cycle is just about over .
The global temperatures have been nominally flat for the past 8 years .
If the Solar Scientists are correct , we about to head into a cooling cycle ... which is not good news .
Let 's get back to our own science project .
The above chart shows two things we immediately recognize as very similar .
In fact they seem to match each other very well .
We would say they have a strong correlation , and with a little mathematics , we could compare each one point - by - point on the graph and come up with a number that would tell us just how well they match each other , called a correlation coefficient .
In fact , a glance at the above suggests a perfect , 100 % correlation , because in fact one is an exact copy of the other .
We know this because we made the chart .
Now suppose the blue one represents changing CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and the red one represents changing global temperatures over the same time frame .
The above is a gross exaggeration , of course , but we wanted to make sure no one doubted there is a strong correlation between the two .
Is there any doubt that CO2 is causing the global temperature to change ?
Any doubt at all ?
None ?
Zero doubt , right ?
Wrong
In fact , the blue line is exactly one pixel on your screen ahead of the red line .
We know that because we made the chart .
You could n't tell that one was exactly like the other and actually leading it by one pixel without dragging out a powerful magnifying device and doing some very careful measurements and some pretty lengthy mathematics .
This was the fundamental mistake that Mann , Al Gore , the Oscar boys , the Nobel Committee , the IPCC , and just about everyone else on the planet made at the beginning .
They immediately assumed , noticing that CO 2 levels and global temperatures had a pretty good correlation , that CO 2 was the culprit , and was causing global temperatures to rise .
In fact , it appears it was just the opposite : rising global temperatures caused increased CO 2 level in the atmosphere .
So where did the increasing CO 2 come from ?
You can't make CO 2 out of Oxygen and Nitrogen ... surely you 're pulling my leg !
Let 's do a little simple Chemistry , and figure out the molecular mass of the different atmospheric constituents .
For this we go to the Periodic Table of the Elements , and find the atomic mass of Nitrogen , Carbon , Hydrogen , and Oxygen .
Let 's forget about Argon , which is about 0.9 % of the atmosphere , because it 's supposed to be CO 2 that 's the evil stuff .
To the nearest round number , Carbon = 12 , Nitrogen = 14 , Oxygen = 16 , and lowly Hydrogen = 1 .
That 's based on the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the atom .
The Periodic Table will give a slightly different number , because of that binding energy ( which is a mass equivalent ) we talked about earlier .
So , what 's the approximate molecular mass of the different gasses ?
That 's simple addition : Water ( H 2 O ) 1 +1+16 = 18 amu Nitrogen ( N 2 ) 14 + 14 = 28 amu Oxygen ( O 2 ) 16 + 16 = 32 amu Carbon Dioxide ( CO 2 ) 12 + 16 + 16 = 44 amu Remember , we 're rounding off to the nearest whole number , and amu means Atomic Mass Units .
Do you see something significant ?
Think like a scientist .
Yes , CO 2 is by far the heaviest of the major constituents , and the law of gravity applies to it as well .
It sinks to the ground .. in fact , into the ground , and into the oceans , as well , because CO2 is very water - soluble and that 's what puts the fizz in Ginger Ale .
This does n't happen overnight .
In fact , the winds and convection currents and such keep the air stirred up constantly , so it may take 100 - 150 years for the CO 2 you are exhaling right now to make it back into mother earth , where most of it is currently locked up .
Now our puzzle is complete , and we can visualize the whole thing .
1 . The sun heats the earth , repository of most of the CO 2 on the planet .
2 . Some stored CO 2 comes out by a process known as outgassing ( from the soil ) and the champagne effect ( from the oceans ) .
The oceans are by far the largest source .
3 . Sloppy " scientists " see the warming , and the CO 2 , but overlook the changes in the sun , do n't see the fine differences in timing ... and proceed to blame the increasing temperature on CO 2 and mankind as the culprit in a classic knee - jerk reaction .
Funny , any 1st Grader would have told us that if we had asked them " What makes the earth warm , Susie ? "
Nobody ever said science had to be " hard " .
You can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen experiment .
Pour a glass of ginger ale , sit it on the table , and see how long it takes to go " flat " at room temperature .
Now pour an equal glass into a pan and put it on the stove on low heat , then time how long it takes to go flat .
That 's your homework experiment - to demonstrate that extra heat really releases CO 2 a lot faster :-)>
Our satellites are pretty good at measuring overall ocean temperatures from afar , and CO 2 measurements are being taken daily around the globe .
The best results we have been able to turn up so far is that measurable CO 2 increases appear about 9 months after an upswing in ocean temperatures .
The data is messed up a bit every time a volcano decides to blow its top , because that 's the mother of CO 2 producers , bar none .
And a buffalo emits about the same amount of methane ( CH 4 ) as driving your automobile about 8,000 miles - which can combine with O 2 in a highly exothermic reaction ( gives off heat ) to produce CO 2 and H 2 O as end products .
One question that has been nagging us here at the Middlebury Community Network Science Center ( our desk ) is , " how in heck does one measure the " global temperature " in the first place " ?
If we asked you what your skin temperature is right now , you 'd likely answer , " Where ? "
The temperature on your nose is likely far different from the bottom of your feet or other places you might measure .
With the greater portion of the earth covered by water , and no floating temperature recording buoys every mile or so , how can we get an " average " ?
Well , satellites can measure ocean temperatures ( we 'll talk more about that later ) but here in the U.S. , for example there are only 1221 U.S. Historical Climatology Network ( USHCN ) stations , and our math shows that to be about one every 3,400 square miles .
And from that data , one can cherry - pick ( as some have done ) to obtain any result he wants .
For example , here are four records we cherry - picked from the whole dataset - note the temperatures are in Fahrenheit , not Centigrade :
Cornwall , Vermont temperatures appear to have slowly
increased during the past century - about 1/2 °F
... time to break out the lifeboats .
Steamboat Springs , Colorado , on the other hand ,
had a temperature drop of about 4 °F
Darn , they 're stealing our skiers !
Berkley , California really heated up - a whopping 3 °F
Must have been all those protests in the 60's ...
Bucyrus ,
Ohio does n't seem to have a ticket one way
or the other in the Global Warming Game .
Spoil Sports !
What 's that straight line running through the annual average temperature readings ?
The linear regression line obtained from the statistical output is the " best - fitting " straight line that can be drawn through the data .
It is designated by the equation Y = b 1 X + b 0 , where X represents the year , Y represents the predicted temperature anomaly , b 1 is the slope of the line and b 0 is the Y intercept of the line .
Now you know .
While we can joke about individual station readings , in fact there may be something skewing the data .
Berkley , California , for example , was a sleepy little town back in 1857 , when the data starts .
Since that time , it has grown into a much larger city , with many miles of asphalt roads operating as near - perfect " black body " heat radiators .
This is known as the " urban heat island " effect .
Many Climate Scientists now seriously doubt the accuracy of even the 20th century section of the hockey stick .
Anthony Watts , writing in ICECAP , gives us a typical example :
This NOAA USHCN climate station of record # 415018 in Lampasas , Texas , was found to be tucked between a building and two parking lots , one with nearby vehicles .
According to the surveyor , it is right next to the ACE Hardware store on the main street of town .
While likely representative of the temperature for downtown Lampasas , one wonders how well it measures the climate of the region .
In her survey , volunteer surveyor Julie K. Stacy noted the proximity to the building and parking , which will certainly affect Tmin ( the lowest temperature ) at night due to IR radiance .
Daytime Tmax is likely affected by the large amount of asphalt and concrete in the area around the sensor .
You too can check the temperature history near your Grandpappy 's home by accessing the Historical Climatology Network ( USHCN ) stations databank .
While Al Gore 's Oscar and Nobel Prize winning film , An Inconvenient Truth , has serious students of climate change laughing their heads off , the British did n't think it was very funny .
The British High Court has ruled that it cannot be shown to students without first having a disclaimer that it is " propaganda " , instead of a " documentary " .
Those Brits just do n't seem to have a sense of humor ... or maybe they just think scaring little kids is n't an honorable pastime .
Nevertheless , the film makes a good outline for further discussion .
Let 's start with those poor little Polar Bears , taking their swim in the vast , empty Arctic ocean , just before they drown .
Carole " CJ " Williams probably sums it up best , so we 'll just quote her below ..
Last March , global warming fanatic Al Gore used a picture of two polar bears purportedly stranded on melting ice off the coast of Alaska as a visual aide to support his claim that man-made global warming is doing great harm to Mother Earth .
The one he chose , but didnt offer to pay for right away , turned out to be a photo of a polar bear and her cub out doing what healthy , happy polar bears do on a wave - eroded chunk of ice not all that far from shore in the Beaufort Sea north of Barstow , Alaska .
The picture , wrongly credited to Dan Crosbie , an ice observer specialist for the Canadian Ice Service , was actually taken by Amanda Byrd while she was on a university - related research cruise in August of 2004 , a time of year when the fringe of the Arctic ice cap normally melts .
Byrd , a marine biology grad student at the time , was gathering zooplankton for a multi- year study of the Arctic Ocean .
Crosbie , who was also on the trip , pilfered the polar bear photo from a shared computer onboard the Canadian icebreaker where Ms. Byrd downloaded her snapshots ; he saved it in his personal file .
Several months later , Crosbie , who is known as an avid photographer , gave the photo to the Canadian Ice Service , which then allowed Environment Canada to use it as an illustration for an online magazine .
Today that photo , with credit given to photographer Dan Crosbie and the Canadian Ice Service , can be found all over the Internet , generally with the caption  Two polar bears are stranded on a chunk of melting ice .
It s a hoax , folks .
The bears , which can swim distances of 100 miles and more , werent stranded ; they were merely taking a break and watching the boat go by when a lady snapped their picture .
On Feb. 2 , 2007 Denis Simard , a representative of Environment Canada , distributed that ladys photo to 7 media agencies , including the Associated Press , and timed it to coincide with the release of the United Nations  major global warming report in Paris , France on Feb 3rd .
When the press called Simard in Paris to ask if it was his picture and could they print it , he says ,  I gave them permission because Dan said it was his picture . 
Al Gore saw the picture shortly thereafter and contrived to use it in a presentation about man-made global warming that he staged at a conference of human resource executives on March 22 , 2007 in Toronto , Canada .
With an enlarged version of Amanda Byrds polar bear picture on the screen behind him , Gore said ,  Their habitat is melting beautiful animals , literally being forced off the planet .
They re in trouble , got nowhere else to go . 
Of course , after those words were spoken , the audience , being under the impression that polar bears are in imminent danger , gasped with concern and sympathy for the plight of the poor , pathetic polar bear population , whose diet , by the way , can include convenient humans , though attacks , like wolf - human attacks , are said to be rare .
According to Ms. Bryd , when she took the picture , the mother bear and its cub didnt appear to be in any danger and Denis Simard seems to have backpedaled when quoted by Ontarios National Post as saying that you have to keep in mind that the bears arent in danger at all .
It was , if you will , their playground for 15 minutes .
You know what I mean ?
This is a perfect picture for climate change , in a way , because you have the impression they are in the middle of the ocean and they are going to die with a coke in their hands .
But they were not that far from the coast , and it was possible for them to swim . 
That " Melting " Arctic Ice
At left is a screen shot from the Greenpeace web site , from a video which drips with the urgency of stopping the " melting " of the Arctic Ice Pack .
But look closely :
Those are shear lines , where the ice has broken , not " melted " .
Melting does not occur in particular paths across the ice sheet , except when being zapped by aliens in UFO's .
Note closely the comment " more severe storms that wreak havoc on our home and communities " .
It has become most popular to blame global warming ( and man ) on virtually everything under the sun .
And we must n't forget to throw in a non-sequitur related to the " elderly and poor " - whose beachfront condos will soon be under water , no doubt .
But a new study released in Jan , 2008 by Chunzai Wang , a research oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Miami Lab and the University of Miami , suggests that Global warming could actually reduce the number of hurricanes that hit the United States .
Wong found a link between warming waters , especially in the Indian and Pacific oceans , to increased vertical wind shear in the Atlantic Ocean near the United States
And wind shear - a change in wind speed or direction - makes it hard for hurricanes to form , strengthen and stay alive .
His conclusion is , " Global warming may decrease the likelihood of hurricanes making landfall in the United States , " His study is published in Geophysical Research Letters .
The global warming hysterians very typically use photos of perfectly normal weather phenomena to promote panic ( and presumably , donations to their cause ) .
Particularly popular are videos of calving glaciers , which break off and create quite a splash when they hit the water .
But any 10 - year - old knows that a calving glacier is a result of a growing , not receding glacier .
A receding glacier , well ... recedes ... and calves no more .
To make a very long story much shorter , the warmer oceans have indeed been selectively melting some portions of the Arctic Ice Cap , but severe storms created large waves which broke up , rather than melted a substantial portion of the edges of the polar ice .
This re-freezes in the winter .
And you do n't have to panic : the cold winter of 2007 - 2008 has returned the arctic ice cap to a handsome 13,000 000 square kilometers - which may melt again in normal summer melting cycle .
There 's tons of research going on in this field as well .
And about those " melting glaciers ... "
Strange how our research turned up a completely different story .
We found 50 glaciers are advancing in New Zealand , others are growing in Alaska , Switzerland , the Himalayas , and even our old friend , Mt. St. Helens is sprouting a brand new crater glacier that is advancing at 3 feet per year .
And down south last September , NASA satellites showed the Antarctic Ice Field to be the largest it has ever been in the 30 years it has been observed by satellite ( based on an analysis of 347 million radar altimeter measurements made by the European Space Agency 's ERS - 1 and ERS - 2 satellites ) .

Note the position of the large waterfall .
The glacier advanced about one - third of a mile sometime between August 2006 and June 2007 .
Photo by Chris Larsen , Geophysical Institute , UAF Al Gore tells us the Greenland ice cap is thinning , but he does n't mention that a newly discovered volcanic " hot spot " may be a contributor , along with warming on the coast due to warmer waters coming up the gulf stream .
In general , we found growing glaciers outpacing melting glaciers by a good margin .
Nothing like cherry - picking an isolated example to create panic , Al . Our Oceanography friends tell us that the actual measured rise in average ocean levels is on the order of 1.6 millimeters ( about the width of a match ) annually .
There are 25.4 mm in an inch , so in 25 years , the oceans might be up about 1.5 inches or so if the trend continues .
In a thousand years , it will be up a whopping 64 inches , and everyone but the NBA is clearly in serious trouble .
Al Gore , on the other hand , recently said the problem is much worse than previously thought , and the Polar Ice Cap will be completely gone in 5 years .
We 're going to hold you to that , Albert .
We wonder if anyone has ever had a Nobel Prize taken back ...
If you make a quick knee - jerk assumption , you 'd probably conclude that something has to be melting somewhere to cause such a steady rise , however miniscule .
But there 's another principle of physics at work here called thermal expansion .
When you heat an object , it gets bigger .
Since the oceans have been slowly warming over the past few centuries , the volume of the oceans has also been increasing a tiny bit , and that can possibly account for most , if not all , of the 1 mm per year rise in the average sea level .
Old glaciers are a wonderful repository of historical information , because past samples of earth 's atmosphere are locked up in them .
Coral heads and Sargasso Sea sediments also leave Carbon 14 and Oxygen 18 clues to the past temperature of the earth .
We all agree that the historical CO 2 curves and the temperatures curves closely match each other .
But when we look closely at the CO 2 and temperature data found locked in ancient ice core samples , we find that increases in CO 2 are actually following increases in temperature and that CO 2 does n't cause warming - warming causes CO 2 to increase .
Summary - Exactly what have we learned here ?
1. The " Greenhouse Effect " is a natural and valuable phenomenon , without which , the planet would be uninhabitable .
2 . Modest Global Warming , at least up until 1998 when a cooling trend began , has been real .
3 . CO2 is not a significant greenhouse gas ; 95 % of the contribution is due to Water Vapor .
4 . Man 's contribution to Greenhouse Gasses is relatively insignificant .
We did n't cause the recent Global Warming and we cannot stop it .
5 . Solar Activity appears to be the principal driver for Climate Change , accompanied by complex ocean currents which distribute the heat and control local weather systems .
6 . CO2 is a useful trace gas in the atmosphere , and the planet would actually benefit by having more , not less of it , because it is not a driver for Global Warming and would enrich our vegetation , yielding better crops to feed the expanding population .
7 . CO2 is not causing global warming , in fact , CO2 is lagging temperature change in all reliable datasets .
The cart is not pulling the donkey , and the future cannot influence the past .
8 . Nothing happening in the climate today is particularly unusual , and in fact has happened many times in the past and will likely happen again in the future .
9 . The UN IPCC has corrupted the " reporting process " so badly , it makes the oil - for - food scandal look like someone stole some kid 's lunch money .
They do not follow the Scientific Method , and modify the science as needed to fit their predetermined conclusions .
In empirical science , one does NOT write the conclusion first , then solicit " opinion " on the report , ignoring any opinion which does not fit their predetermined conclusion while falsifying data to support unrealistic models .
10 . Polar Bear populations are not endangered , in fact current populations are healthy and at almost historic highs .
The push to list them as endangered is an effort to gain political control of their habitat ... particularly the North Slope oil fields .
11 .
There is no demonstrated causal relationship between hurricanes and / or tornadoes and global warming .
This is sheer conjecture totally unsupported by any material science .
12 . Observed glacial retreats in certain select areas have been going on for hundreds of years , and show no serious correlation to short - term swings in global temperatures .
13 . Greenland is shown to be an island completely surrounded by water , not ice , in maps dating to the 14th century .
There is active geothermal activity in the currently " melting " sections of Greenland .
14 . The Antarctic Ice cover is currently the largest ever observed by satellite , and periodic ice shelf breakups are normal and correlate well with localized tectonic and geothermal activity along the Antarctic Peninsula .
15 . The Global Warming Panic was triggered by an artifact of poor mathematics which has been thoroughly disproved .
The panic is being deliberately nurtured by those who stand to gain both financially and politically from perpetuation of the hoax .
16 . Scientists who " deny " the hoax are often threatened with loss of funding or even their jobs .
17 .
The correlation between solar activity and climate is now so strong that solar physicists are now seriously discussing the much greater danger of pending global cooling .
18 . Biofuel hysteria is already having a disastrous effect on world food supplies and prices , and current technologies for biofuel production consume more energy than the fuels produce .
19 . Global Warming Hysteria is potentially linked to a stress - induced mental disorder .
20 .
In short , there is no " climate crisis " of any kind at work on our planet .
How do we end the panic ?
We 've heard several anecdotal examples of local children becoming frightened after seeing Al Gore 's movie , and maybe that 's why we 're so angry with him .
To counter that , the British High Court has ruled that the film , if shown in their schools , must be preceded by a disclaimer that it is propaganda , not a documentary .. and a specific list of 9 distinct inaccuracies must be included in the warning .
The 9 have since expanded to 35 , and we heartily encourage you to examine each and every one by clicking HERE .
From our point of view , we 're watching a world gone mad , with everyone hustling to get a piece of the action .
Politicians , radical environmentalists , and even mainstream businesses are scrambling to appear as " green " as they can - and reap of piece of the financial action sure to follow as funds are diverted from normal paths in a headlong race to save the planet .
Some of this is actually good .
We do need to cut down on our use of petroleum fuels , because they 're becoming more and more expensive to find and recover - and as Will Rogers said , " They 're making more people every day , but they ain't making any more dirt . "
Green is good , and we here at the Community Network try very hard to be good stewards of the environment .
We recycle everything , drive 2nd - hand cars that get high gas mileage , and even had only one offspring - thus gaining one whole human lifetime of " carbon credits " .
It is overpopulation , after all , that is using up our resources at an ever - increasing rate .
So the Great Global Warming Hoax could have a unintended positive side in energy conservation , and even Hitler made the trains run on time in Nazi Germany .
But is it wise to achieve a noble goal by deceit , information spin , bad science , dire predictions , censorship , and outright terrorism of our children ?
We think not .
We understand that those who jumped on the Global Bandwagon early on are now in a difficult position .
Many are now searching for a way to back out quietly , without having their professional careers ruined .
Others are continuing to miss - quote all the bad " science " on the subject , desperate to perpetuate what appears now to be only a myth .
The Popular Journalists would starve if folks stopped reading their global hysteria books , and if folks stopped believing that Global Warming is man-made , they 'll have to find some new themes on catastrophic events and sell us on the idea that we 're to blame .
A recent U.S. Senate report quotes 400 + scientists who originally bought the global warming hoax , and are now confessing that they do n't believe in it any more .
Yes , Sen .
Inhofe , who sponsored the report is a minority Republican on the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , and the liberal Democrats are n't about to believe anything he says , but we 'll give him credit for being the first member of Congress to take a stand against the growing hysteria .
It 's a mess , and we 're in it up to our cultural necks .
What is potentially more alarming , is that some of the early knee - jerk scientists that were so quick to jump on the climate panic bandwagon are now fighting desperately to save their careers by deliberately producing falsified data in a last - ditch effort to support their individual research and save their professional reputations .
In our own research , we uncovered some " data " in which a CO2 curve from an ice core study was conveniently moved some 83 years down the time scale , so the desired " results " could be obtained .
It 's much too lengthy to discuss here , but if you 'd like to delve into the subject in depth , we 've posted the full paper by Prof.
Zbigniew Jaworowski , Chairman of the Scientific Council of Central Laboratory for Radiological Protection in Warsaw , Poland .
Powerful political forces are also hard at work , attempting to preserve what we currently perceive as to be a myth by government - enforced " education " .
The State of California is attempting to require the myth to be taught in all of their public schools .
Given the general level of science literacy of most public school teachers , particularly in the lower grades , we wonder from where the course materials would come .
We 're betting Greenpeace would be more than happy to supply the " information " .
We 're also betting that Vermont could soon follow suit .
We do n't call ourselves the Green Mountain State for nothing .
The " debate " now seems to be settled down between two opposing political forces , commonly labeled " liberal " and " conservative " , and two separate scientific " methods " of proving their points .
Here they are , in a nutshell :
All of the empirical evidence now favors the " conservatives " , who apply the laws of physics and chemistry to known data and conclude that anthropogenic global warming can't be happening .
The coup de grace on the conservative side is the fact that CO2 is lagging temperature , and thus , they say , what happens next month can't possibly be affecting what is happening today .
We tend to favor this logic .
The " liberals " , on the other hand , have turned to computer modeling to " prove " the world is about to come to an end .
Models can and in fact are being constructed which can prove anything you want .
By tweaking the data , you can even make them come out with the opposite answer .
" Modeling " is a perfect tool for perpetuating a scam like this , because they have absolutely no basis in factual science , yet are easy to sell to the unsuspecting public who thinks they are a part of legitimate research process .
Unfortunately , there is much " model tweaking " ( OK , " faking " is the better word ) being done by the Hysterians to " prove " the sky is falling .
This is commonly known as Junk Science .
We saw one climate model in which the temperature was held constant while the CO2 concentration was arbitrarily doubled , a brilliant erasure of the laws of physics .
The ultimate " judge " at present is the press .
Fortunately for the Junk Scientists , the scientifically illiterate reporters and other popular journalists are quick to grab anything that calls for change , change , change ( does that have a familiar ring to it ? ) .
Since most of the press , ranging from our local folks to the New York Times , tend to showcase the Junk Science and suppress the empirical results , the equally science illiterate public gets only one side of the story , and they , in turn , quickly organize mass demonstrations calling for change , change , change .
Presumably , if you march enough protest signs around the country , the Laws of Physics will bend to your will .
There 's Big Bucks to be made promoting the hoax .
Take a look at this clipping from a " green " directory site :
Great News !!
We now have a 34 ACRE NURSERY SITE underway in Maine with a wood and solar heated greenhouse for tree seedling production .
This will enable us to grow out millions of seedlings for transplanting to deforested areas across the north woods .
If you would like to DIRECTLY OFFSET YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT there is a PAYPAL DONATION button under the picture .
ANY AMOUNT will help further the CO2 Reduction project !!
Thanks !!
Editors Note :
We have an even better offer :
For every 10 bucks you send us , we will hold our breath for one full minute before exhaling the CO2 into the atmosphere .
This " carbon offset " will make you feel good about driving your Hummer to the next Global Warming demonstration .
" Climate Science " has become the new gold mine for research funding .
Any funding grant application today had better have the words " Global Warming " in it somewhere if you want to rise to the top of the pile when the money is handed out .
Spending on " climate research " has skyrocketed from $ 175 million to $ 5 billion annually , and you 'd better make sure your " results " support AGW , or the Leprechaun will get away and your pot of gold will vanish .
" Peer Review " has generally become a laugh , as the Hoaxters now all review each other 's work , and the cash register keeps ringing .
A huge proportion of the " climate scientists " now at work were n't even interested in the subject a few years ago , and it's a bandwagon playing the new pop tune of " Ca- Ching , Ca- Ching " .
The Hoaxters now control many of the science journals , and are suppressing any honest research that exposes what John Coleman , founder of The Weather Channel , has called " the greatest scam in history " .
In writing this editorial , we of course automatically become " deniers " , the heathens of physics who have n't converted to the new religion of global panic .
It 's now 100 % honorable to fake your results , because keeping a paycheck is a most honorable pursuit .
It 's now critically important to keep the hoax afloat , for if the public ever finds out global warming is a purely natural phenomenon , the money will dry up in a heartbeat , because no government wants to waste money on something man can't possibly change .
Recently , several NASA scientists have resigned in protest of the bureaucrats who run the agency supporting Junk Science in order to secure more funding for climate - related satellite systems and other " research " .
And scientists who speak out too loudly against the hoax have actually been fired for crossing paths with the politicians promoting Junk Science , as recently happened to University of Washington climate scientist Mark Albright , who was dismissed from his position as associate state climatologist , just weeks after exposing false claims of shrinking glaciers in the Cascade Mountains .
Seems Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels claimed the Cascade glaciers were melting , and Albright , in charge of the glacier studies , said they were n't .
Nickels had enough clout to get Albright bounced from his job .
Our public schools seem to be highly infected with what the serious climate scientists are now calling the new " religious cult " of anthropogenic global warming hysteria .
No longer are teachers inviting their students to explore climate change - now they are being instructed to " make a nice poster showing how you can stop global warming " .
This appears to be primarily an American phenomenon .
Graduate schools in technology report their classes are mostly filled with foreign students , and U.S. Public High School students are the most science and mathematics illiterate of all developed nations .
" Education " majors ( our future teachers ) have the lowest SAT scores of any college major so we are stuck in a catch 22 situation where the least qualified to teach anyone about anything are churning out mostly scientifically illiterate students who then go off to college and emerge with thousands of degrees in Art History with no job in their field waiting for them when they graduate .
Let 's all lie to our children while we 're at it The Down - To - Earth Guide to Global Warming
by Laurie David and Cambria Gordon
This children 's book " explains " the Global Warming Hoax to English - speaking children everywhere .
Here 's a textbook case ( pun intended ) of how to pull the wool over their eyes .
Simply insert a fraudulent graph clearly showing Climate Temperature to be following CO2 levels , in the same manner as Al Gore .
This is easily done by swapping the actual CO2 and Temperature graphs , as shown below .
Then finish with the statement : " What makes this graph so amazing is that by connecting rising CO2 to rising temperature scientists have discovered the link between greenhouse - gas pollution and global warming .
Of course , the actual data shows just the opposite - that CO2 lags , not leads temperature , and thus " proving " just the opposite .
Do n't worry , the parents are n't smart enough to detect the lie , either .
The battle now seems to have settled down as a war between two major information sources .
The " mainstream media " who controls the printed word on paper ( such as the book above ) and the talking heads on TV are generally supporting the Junk Science .
The Internet - last bastion of free speech and the only significant outlet for empirical science , is slowly gaining ground exposing the scam , but so far it 's pretty much an imbalanced situation , since the Junk Scientists also know how to build web sites and blogs and are doing their best to spread the panic in that media as well .
For example Richard S. Lindzen , in his paper at the 2005 Yale Center for Globalization conference clearly points to one particular pro-hoax web site calling itself " Real Climate " which tells us that it is all about " climate science from climate scientists " , featuring among others , the now universally discredited work of Michael Mann and others who were too quick to become his overnight followers .
The site is n't actually run by " scientists " , it 's actually run by Environmental Media Services , which specializes in spreading environmental junk science on behalf of numerous clients who stand to financially benefit from scare tactics through environmental fear mongering .
Lindzen says , " This website appears to constitute a support center for global warming believers , wherein any criticism of global warming is given an answer that , however implausible , is then repeated by the reassured believers .
A collection of stock responses for believers is also featured on Gristmill , where the Popular Journalists and mainstream media can quickly obtain a handbook for perpetuating the scam , and become instant experts on the spot .
In the end , time will be the final judge .
If the ice caps do n't melt in our lifetimes ( or in 5 years , as Al Gore is predicting ) then future historians are going to have a rich trove of material on how the entire world went bonkers over a global temperature shift of a few tenths of a degree attributed to our " carbon footprint " .
If New York floods during the last game of the World Series , then the Computer Modeling has won out over the Laws of Physics and at least we 'll be able to make new models which will cure cancer , end starvation , stop wars , and lower our taxes all at the same time .
Most of the best research has been performed in the last 3 years , and strongly supports the notion that CO2 plays little role in global warming .
You will probably not be allowed to find this out , except in places like this .
The IPCC policy writers were actually instructed to ignore the most recent and likely best information in their earlier reports to the world 's governments , and of course the Popular Journalists continue to quote the older , now debunked " science " that led to the panic in the first place .
It has turned real nasty , and it is our strong feeling that much skullduggery is afoot .
One of the hallmarks of American politics is to tell a lie often enough until it magically becomes the truth .
The corruption of the UN IPCC would make another long treatise in itself , but we wo n't go there in this particular piece , because we do n't want to scare our children into thinking that scandals in the UN were making unwitting liars out of their teachers .
Remember , the UN IPCC reports are the very foundation of the Global Warming Hysterians ' arguments .
That 's where they get the " all the world 's climate scientists now agree " baloney .
Scientists who disagree with the policy writers ( who are largely bureaucrats appointed by their own governments ) are ignored in the reports , a well known phenomenon .
And several IPCC scientists are currently raising Cain with the IPCC policy writers to stop using their name as " agreeing " with the Junk Science IPCC reports .
( The IPCC claims that all of their member scientists and contributors approve of their phony reports , and as best we can determine at the present time , a majority probably does not ) .
Alec Rawls probably sums up the IPCC corruption best : " What I found interesting in the IPCC report is how blatant the statistical fraud is , omitting the competing explanation from the models completely , while pretending that they are using their models to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural warming .
These people are going to hang on to their power grab until the bitter end . "
And we might be wrong .
We 're pledged to good science , without any political or environmental agenda producing hasty conclusions , and this ball game is still in play .
We 've done an enormous amount of homework , and reached a preliminary opinion on the matter , and are intent on remaining politically independent in this regard .
If we 're wrong , delaying immediate action will only hasten doomsday .
If we 're right , then nature will take its course as it always has , and normal life will go on by adapting to climate change , rather than freaking out over a pending climate catastrophe .
That 's what the Scientists ' letter to the U.N. was all about .
What can you do to further expose this Global Hoax seemingly being spread to promote radical political and environmental issues ?
You could start by sending the URL of this page to your friends and other " regular " folks who have no environmental ax to grind and are only seeking some realistic appraisal of the situation .
This article has now been " peer reviewed " by dozens of highly qualified scientists in fields related to climate change , and there has been no fault found in our physics , chemistry , or mathematics to date .
It has already " gone viral " world - wide , and has been read in 83 foreign countries at last check .
We invite , but flames and rants and other childish stuff will be deleted and you wo n't even get the courtesy of a reply .
We do welcome comment from intelligent folk who have something original to say , but please do n't bombard us with cut - and - paste cherry - picking from climate hysteria sites on the internet , because trust us , we 've already read all that .
We admire your tenacity in reading this all the way to the end .

BBC News , Baghdad
" I have n't left my home in two months , " says Kulsoom , a medical student who lives in east Baghdad with her family .
The US has beefed up its forces in Iraq by 30,000 soldiers
Not to see friends or relatives , not to go shopping , not to go to college for the extra training she would like before the new academic year begins .
She has a lot of catching up to do .
Kulsoom missed half her classes last year because of bombs , shootings and other threats which prevented either her or her teachers from reaching class .
Only a few family members ever go out , for daily essentials .
Otherwise they stay at home , day after day .
But they would agree with Gen Petraeus that there has been a drop in violence since the American troop surge .
" There are fewer attacks , " says Kulsoom .
" Now it is only four or five killed a day in our area .
It used to be 20 or 30 . "
" But we are still afraid .
Nothing has really changed . "
Spoiling for a fight
This is typical of what you hear from many Baghdad residents , nine months since President George W Bush announced his last - ditch bid to try to turn Iraq round .
I am the optimistic one in my family but I have to admit that nothing has changed
Kulsoom
Baghdad student
US surge has failed - poll Viewpoints : Iraq surge
But that does not mean people feel any safer .
It does not mean they believe the US troop surge has yet led to any lasting change that is bringing the fighting to an end .
More concrete barriers divide the city , more checkpoints .
But they have only dampened the violence , not addressed its causes , people say .
Even if most Iraqis are exhausted by conflict , the many factions are not and the struggle for power goes on in a society which Ryan Crocker , the US ambassador to Iraq , acknowledged was still deeply " traumatised " by years under Saddam Hussein 's brutal rule .
Sunni groups who have allied themselves with the Americans in the former al - Qaeda stronghold of Anbar are not necessarily allies of the Baghdad government .
Many Sunni tribesmen openly say it is a " government of Iran " controlled from Tehran .
The suspicion is returned by many in Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's Shia - dominated government , who are anxious about the growing strength of some of these Sunni groups .
There is no doubt that there has been a significant turnaround in Anbar , because of the tribal rebellion against al - Qaeda there .
It is the one relative success the Americans can point to .
But it is far from clear this will help bring wider peace and reconciliation .
Militia rule
There is little sign of this either along other ethnic , political and sectarian fault lines .
Death squads still operate in Baghdad and many cities , even if at lower levels than last year .
Under Saddam , it was the mukhabarat [ secret police ] we were terrified of - now it is the Mehdi Army
Ali
shopkeeper
Moqtada Sadr 's Mehdi Army has continued to penetrate deeper into every aspect of life .
" Under Saddam , it was the mukhabarat [ secret police ] we were terrified of , " says shopkeeper Ali .
" Now it is the Mehdi Army .
They are everywhere . "
The only political progress since the surge is that the various boycotts of parliament have ended .
But there is no sign that Iraq 's politicians can now come together to agree on legislation such as sharing oil revenues or constitutional reform .
In their marbled villas , hidden behind the walls and razor wire of the Green Zone , Iraq 's democratically elected politicians seem ever more out of touch .
Outside , people wrestle with the same problems .
" We only get two hours of electricity a day , " says Kulsoom .
" One in the morning , one in the evening . "
The Americans send out constant press releases to journalists talking of new projects to improve the power system .
But the situation is as bad as ever .
Even this lower level of violence is still shockingly high .
Iraqis still get kidnapped every day .
Gen Petraeus told Congress that the number of car bombs was down by half from the start of the year .
But they are still running at a rate of three a day .
Leaving Iraq
With so little sign of permanent change , that is why so many people continue to leave Iraq - up to 20,000 a week heading to already overwhelmed Syria .
Kulsoom says 60 or 70 of her classmates have left in the past 18 months , many of her professors too .
One hopeful sign is that a majority of Iraqis remain committed to the idea of Iraq as a unified state - not one split between Shia , Sunnis , Kurds and other groups .
A poll for the BBC and ABC News released on the eve of the general 's testimony bore this out .
But this is not enough to overcome the violence .
" I am the optimistic one in my family , " says Kulsoom .
" But I have to admit that nothing has changed . "
Nowadays everyone needs to be connected .
In Russia it ’s no exception .
People want to connect and providers try to link them all but the lack of communication tunnels in old Russian heavily populated houses make the task more challenging leading to the solutions like the ones on those photos .
A survey of experts yields good news for anyone who thought their sexual efforts did n't last long enough .
Good sex typically lasts 13 minutes or less , not counting foreplay .
Penn State Erie researchers Eric Corty and Jenay Guardiani surveyed members of the Society for Sex Therapy and Research , which includes psychologists , physicians , social workers , marriage / family therapists and nurses who have collectively treated thousands of patients over several decades .
The results debunk the myth of hours - long sex as a reasonable goal that lingers in the minds of many supposed under-achievers .
A total of 34 experts responded to the survey and were asked what they thought was the optimal time for intercourse , from penetration to ejaculation .
On average , the respondents in this relatively small survey ranked a duration of 3 to 7 minutes as adequate and 7 to 13 minutes as desirable .
Anything less was considered , on average , to be to short and anything more , too long .
" A man ’s or woman ’s interpretation of his or her sexual functioning as well as the partner ’s relies on personal beliefs developed in part from society ’s messages , formal and informal , " the researchers said .
" Unfortunately , today ’s popular culture has reinforced stereotypes about sexual activity .
Many men and women seem to believe the fantasy model of large penises , rock - hard erections and all - night - long intercourse . "
Past research has found that a large percentage of men and women say they want sex to last 30 minutes or longer , the researchers say .
" This seems a situation ripe for disappointment and dissatisfaction , " said lead author Eric Corty , associate professor of psychology .
" With this survey , we hope to dispel such fantasies and encourage men and women with realistic data about acceptable sexual intercourse , thus preventing sexual disappointments and dysfunctions . "
The results will be published in the May issue of the Journal of Sexual Medicine .
It ’s easy to be over - dazzled by the brain .
Who could be unimpressed by the billions of neurons packed into our skulls , linked together by trillions of connections , capable of encoding memories from decades ago , of playing a saxophone , of sending space probes out of our solar system ?
We naturally want to know how our brain got to be so good .
But there ’s an even more interesting question worth asking :
How do we manage to survive with a brain that ’s so bad ?
The job of the brain is to make decisions .
It takes in information from its senses , which it then processes in a vast network of neuron circuits , finally producing some kind of output .
The output may be as abstract as casting a vote , or as basic as taking a breath .
These decisions depend on handling signals with extreme precision .
Errors that creep into those signals as they ricochet around the nervous system are called noise .
Remarkably , the closer scientists look at the brain , the more noise they discover .
Signals are encoded in the brain with spikes of voltage that travel down the length of neurons .
These spikes are something like the digital stream of information that moves through a computer .
But instead of silicon and gallium , neurons are made of fat , water and protein .
They transmit their voltage spikes by opening channels , letting in charged atoms .
The channels create a surge of current , which then causes the neighboring channels to open up .
Each channel stays open only for an instant , as the spike of voltage rolls down the neuron , like a wave moving across a stadium .
The trouble with neurons , as scientists from Cambridge University write in the new issue of Nature Reviews Neuroscience , is that the channels do n’t always do what they ’re supposed to .
The channels are continually wobbling and twitching , and sometimes they open up a little earlier than they should , splitting a single wave in two .
Sometimes they open late , or not at all .
These delinquent channels can make a short , sharp wave blur into a longer , weaker one .
Channels sometimes open up when there is no wave , creating an entirely false spike .
The damage done to signals in our neurons is proving to be huge .
As a train of voltage spikes travels down the length of a neuron , it can lose more than 25 percent of its information .
More noise can creep into the brain 's signals at other stages as well .
When signals reach the tip of a neuron , they trigger a release of chemicals that flow to a nearby neuron , triggering a new voltage spike that can race onward .
But these chemicals do n’t work like simple switches ; sometimes they fail to cross the gap , and the signal fails as well .
As a signal moves from neuron to neuron to neuron , each one can add more noise to the signal , like a mental game of telephone .
All this noise can blur our perception of the outer world and throw off the commands our brains send to our muscles .
The noise in our brains is so huge that it puts some hard limits on how well they work .
One of the best ways to build a powerful brain is to use tiny neurons .
As the size of each neuron shrinks , you can fit more of them in a given space .
They can make more connections with one another , and it takes less energy for them to send signals .
It turns out , however , that our neurons could be much smaller than they actually are .
If you packed all material necessary for sending signals as tightly as possible , the branches of a neuron ( called axons ) would measure just .06 microns [ about 2.3 millionths of an inch ] across .
In fact , the thinnest axons are about .1 microns [ about 4 millionths of an inch ] .
Recent studies have shown that it 's noise that prevents them from getting thinner .
The thinner an axon gets , the noisier it becomes .
Below .1 microns , the noise abruptly rises so much that it drowns out any signal .
We might be far smarter if noise did n't keep us from growing more neurons .
Scientists are finding that much of the brain 's organization is dedicated to fighting noise .
One way to fight it is to calculate the average of several signals .
When we hear a sound , hair - like structures on neurons in our ears wiggle .
Their wiggling creates a pattern of voltage spikes , which the neuron then passes on to 10 to 30 other neurons .
All of those neurons then carry the same signal toward the brain , where they can be compared .
Each neuron degrades the signal in a uniquely random way , and by averaging all of their signals together , the brain can cancel out some of the noise .
In order to reduce noise even more , our brains do not passively take in impressions of the world , like soft wax stamped with a seal .
To perceive , we actually compare .
When new signals arrive from our eyes , for example , we compare them with information stored in our brains about what the world usually looks like – the fact that objects have edges , for example .
This comparison allows us to discard the distractions of noise and focus on the authentic signal .
Our brains also can't be passive in the way they issue commands to our muscles .
A garbled signal could make us take a fatal misstep .
Instead , our brains are constantly receiving information about how well our bodies are reaching their goals .
To compensate for noise , our brains send out continuously updated commands to correct for previous ones .
Impressive ?
Absolutely .
Our brains unconsciously carry out sophisticated calculations that engineers are trying to mimic to build better computers and communication systems .
And yet all of this complex math serves a paradoxical purpose : to make up for the mistakes built into our very biology .

Carl Zimmer won the 2007 National Academies Communications Award * * for his writing in The New York Times and elsewhere .
His next book , Microcosm : E. coli and the New Science of Life will be published in May .
THE UCC CONNECTION by Howard Freeman " I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves , be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove . "
This is a slightly condensed , casually paraphrased transcript of tapes of a seminar given in 1990 by Howard Freeman .
It was prepared to make available the knowledge and experience of Mr. Freeman in his search for an accessible and understandable explanation of the confusing state of the government and the courts .
It should be helpful to those who may have difficulty learning from such lectures , or those who want to develop a deeper understanding of this information without having to listen to three or four hours of recorded material .
The frustration many Americans feel about our judicial system can be overwhelming and often frightening ; and , like most fear , is based on lack of understanding or knowledge .
Those of us who have chosen a path out of bondage and into liberty are faced , eventually , with the seemingly tyrannical power of some governmental agency and the mystifying and awesome power of the courts .
We have been taught that we must " get a good lawyer , " but that is becoming increasingly difficult , if not impossible .
If we are defending ourselves from the government , we find that the lawyers quickly take our money and then tell us as the ship is sinking , " I can't help you with that -- I 'm an officer of the court . "
Ultimately , the only way for us to have even a ' snowball 's chance ' is to understand the RULES OF THE GAME , and to come to an understanding of the true nature of the Law .
The lawyers have established and secured a virtual monopoly over this area of human knowledge by implying that the subject is just too difficult for the average person to understand , and by creating a separate vocabulary out of English words of otherwise common usage .
While it may , at times , seem hopelessly complicated , it is not that difficult to grasp -- are lawyers really as smart as they would have us believe ?
Besides , anyone who has been through a legal battle against the government with the aid of a lawyer has come to realize that lawyers learn about procedure , not about law .
Mr. Freeman admits that he is not a lawyer , and as such , he has a way of explaining law to us that puts it well within our reach .
Consider also that the framers of the Constitution wrote in language simple enough that the people could understand , specifically so that it would not have to be interpreted .
So again we find , as in many other areas of life , that - THE BUCK STOPS HERE !'
It is we who must take the responsibility for finding and putting to good use the TRUTH .
It is we who must claim and defend our God - given rights and our freedom from those who would take them from us .
It is we who must protect ourselves , our families and our posterity from the inevitable intrusion into our lives by - those who live parasitically off the labor , skill and talents of others .
To these ends , Mr. Freeman offers a simple , hopeful explanation of our plight and a peaceful method of dealing with it .
Please take note that this lecture represents one chapter in the book of his understanding , which he is always refining , expanding , improving .
It is , as all bits of wisdom are , a point of departure from which to begin our own journey into understanding , that we all might be able to pass on to others : greater knowledge and hope , and to God : the gift of lives lived in peace , freedom and praise .
INTRODUCTION
When I beat the IRS , I used Supreme Court decisions .
If I had tried to use these in court , I would have been convicted .
I was involved with a patriot group and I studied supreme Court cases .
I concluded that the Supreme Court had declared that I was not a person required to file an income tax -- that the tax was an excise tax on privileges granted by government .
So I quit filing and paying income taxes , and it was not long before they came down on me with a heavy hand .
They issued a notice of deficiency , which had such a fantastic sum on it that the biggest temptation was to go in with their letter and say .
" Where in the world did you ever get that figure ? "
They claimed I owed them some $ 60,000 .
But even if I had been paying taxes , I never had that much money , so how could I have owed them that much ?
NEVER ARGUE THE AMOUNT OF DEFICIENCY
Fortunately , I had been given just a little bit of information : NEVER ARGUE THE FACTS IN A TAX CASE .
If you 're not required to file , what do you care whether they say you owe sixty dollars or 60,000 dollars .
If you are not required to file , the amount does n't matter .
Do n't argue the amount -- that is a fact issue .
In most instances , when you get a Notice of Deficiency , it is usually for some fantastic amount .
The IRS wants you to run in and argue about the amount .
The minute you say " I do n't owe that much " , you have agreed that you owe them something , and you have given them jurisdiction .
Just do n't be shocked at the amount on a Notice of Deficiency , even if it is ten million dollars !
If the law says that you are not required to file or pay tax , the amount does n't matter .
By arguing the amount , they will just say that you must go to tax court and decide what the amount is to be .
By the time you get to tax court , the law issues are all decided .
You are only there to decide how much you owe .
They will not listen to arguments of law .
So I went to see the agent and told him that I was n't required to file .
He said , " You are required to file , Mr. Freeman . "
But I had all these supreme Court cases , and I started reading them to him .
He said , " I do n't know anything about law , Mr. Freeman , but the Code says that you are required to file , and you 're going to pay that amount or you 're going to go to tax court . "
I thought that someone there ought to know something about law , so I asked to talk to his superior .
I went to him and got out my Supreme Court Cases , and he would n't listen to them .
" I do n't know anything about law , Mr. Freeman .... "
Finally I got to the Problems Resolution Officer , and he said the same thing .
He said that the only person above him was the District Director .
So I went to see him .
By the time I got to his office , they had phoned ahead , and his secretary said he was out .
But I heard someone in his office , and I knew he was in there .
I went down the elevator , around the corner to the Federal Building and into Senator Simpson 's office .
There was a girl sitting there at a desk , and she asked if she could help me .
I told her my problem .
I said that I really thought the District Director was up there .
I asked her to call the IRS and tell them that it was Senator Simpson 's office calling and to ask if the District Director was in .
I said , " If you get him on the phone , tell him that you are from the Senator 's office and you have a person who you are sending over to speak to him -- if he is can he wait just five minutes . "
It worked .
He was there , and I ran back up to his office .
His secretary met me when I came in and said , " Mr. Freeman , you 're so lucky -- the Director just arrived . "
The Director was very nice and offered me coffee and cookies and we sat and talked .
So he asked me what I wanted to talk to him about .
( If you ever have someone say to you , " I 'm from the government and I 'm here to do you a favor " , watch out !-- but we can turn that around and approach them the same way . )
So I said , " I thought you ought to know that there are agents working for you who are writing letters over your name that you would n't agree with .
Do you read all the mail that goes out of this office over your signature ? "
The Director said , " Oh , I could n't read everything -- it goes out of here by the bagful . "
That was what I thought .
I said , " There are some of your agents writing letters which contradict the decisions of the supreme Court of the United States .
And they 're not doing it over their name , they 're doing it over your name . "
He was very interested to hear about it and asked if I had any examples .
I just happened to have some with me , so I got them out and presented them to him .
He thought it was very interesting and asked if I could leave this information with him , which I did .
He said he would look it over and contact me in three days .
Three days later he called me up and said , " I 'm sure , Mr. Freeman , that you will be glad to know that your Notice of Deficiency has been withdrawn .
We 've determined that you 're not a person required to file .
Your file is closed and you will hear no more from us . "
I have n't heard another word from them since .
That was in 1980 , and I have n't filed since 1969 .
THE SUPREME COURT ON TRIAL I thought sure I had the answer , but when a friend got charged with Willful Failure to File an income tax , he asked me to help him .
I told him that they have to prove that he willfully failed to file , and I suggested that he should put me on the witness stand .
He should ask me if I spoke at a certain time and place in Scott 's Bluff , and did I see him in the audience .
He should then ask me what I spoke of that day .
When I got on the stand , I brought out all of the Supreme Court cases I had used with the District Director .
I thought I would be lucky to get a sentence or two out before the judge cut me off , but I was reading whole paragraphs -- and the judge did n't stop me .
I read one and then another , and so on .
And finally when I had read just about as much as I thought I should , the judge called a recess of the court .
I told Bob I thought we had it made .
There was just no way that they could rule against him after all that testimony .
So we relaxed .
The prosecution presented its case and he decided to rest his defense on my testimony , which showed that he was not required to file , and that the Supreme Court had upheld this position .
The prosecution then presented its closing statements and we were just sure that he had won .
But at the very end , the judge spoke to the jury and told them , " You will decide the facts of this case and I will give you the law .
The law required this man to file an Income Tax form ; you decide whether or not he filed it . "
What a shock !
The jury convicted him .
Later some members of the jury said , " What could we do ?
The man had admitted that he had not filed the form , so we had to convict him " .
As soon as the trial was over I went around to the judges 's office and he was just coming in through his back door .
I said , " Judge , by what authority do you overturn the standing decisions of the United States supreme Court .
You sat on the bench while I read that case law .
Now how do you , a District Court Judge , have the authority to overturn decisions of the Supreme Court ? "
He says , " Oh , those were old decisions . "
I said , " Those are standing decisions .
They have never been overturned .
I do n't care how old they are ; you have no right to overturn a standing decision of the United States Supreme Court in a District Court . "
PUBLIC LAW V. PUBLIC POLICY
He said , " Name any decision of the Supreme Court after 1938 and I 'll honor it , but all the decisions you read were prior to 1938 , and I do n't honor those decisions . "
I asked what happened in 1938 .
He said , " Prior to 1938 , the Supreme Court was dealing with Public Law ; since 1938 , the Supreme Court has dealt with Public Policy .
The charge that Mr. S. was being tried for is a Public Policy Statute , not Public Law , and those Supreme Court cases do not apply to Public Policy . "
I asked him what happened in 1938 .
He said that he had already told me too much -- he was n't going to tell me any more .
1938 AND THE ERIE RAILROAD
Well , I began to investigate .
I found that 1938 was the year of the Erie Railroad v. Tompkins case of the Supreme Court .
It was also the year the courts claim they blended Law with Equity .
I read the Erie Railroad case .
A man had sued the Erie railroad for damages when he was struck by a board sticking out of a boxcar as he walked along beside the tracks .
The district court had decided on the basis of Commercial ( Negotiable Instruments )
Law : that this man was not under any contract with the Erie Railroad , and therefore he had no standing to sue the company .
Under the Common Law , he was damaged and he would have had the right to sue .
This overturned a standing decision of over one hundred years .
Swift v. Tyson in 1840 was a similar case , and the decision of the supreme Court was that in any case of this type , the court would judge the case on the Common Law of the state where the incident occurred -- in this case Pennsylvania .
But in the Erie Railroad case , the supreme Court ruled that all federal cases will be judged under the Negotiable Instruments Law .
There would be no more decisions based on the Common Law at the federal level .
So here we find the blending of Law with Equity .
This was a puzzle to me .
As I put these new pieces together , I determined that all our courts since 1938 were Merchant Law courts and not Common Law courts .
There were still some pieces of the puzzle missing .
A FRIEND IN THE COURT Fortunately , I made a friend of a judge .
Now you wo n't make friends with a judge if you go into court like a ' wolf in black sheep country . '
You must approach him as though you are the sheep and he is the wolf .
If you go into court as a wolf , you make demands and tell the judge what the law is -- how he had better uphold the law or else .
Remember the verse : I send you out as sheep in wolf country ; be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove .
We have to go into court and be wise and harmless , and not make demands .
We must play a little dumb and ask a lot of questions .
Well , I asked a lot of questions and boxed the judges into a corner where they had to give me a victory or admit what they did n't want to admit .
I won the case , and on the way out I had to stop by the clerk 's office to get some papers .
One of the judges stopped and said , " You 're an interesting man , Mr. Freeman .
If you 're ever in town , stop by , and if I 'm not sitting on a case we will visit .
AMERICA IS BANKRUPT
Later , when I went to visit the judge , I told him of my problem with the supreme Court cases dealing with Public Policy rather than Public Law .
He said , " In 1938 , all the higher judges , the top attorneys and the U.S. attorneys were called into a secret meeting and this is what we were told : America is a bankrupt nation -- it is owned completely by its creditors .
The creditors own the Congress , they own the Executive , they own the Judiciary and they own all the state governments .
Take silent judicial notice of this fact , but never reveal it openly .
Your court is operating in a Admiralty Jurisdiction -- call it anything you want , but do not call it Admiralty .
ADMIRALTY COURTS
The reason they cannot call it Admiralty Jurisdiction is that your defense would be quite different in Admiralty Jurisdiction from your defense under the Common Law .
In Admiralty , there is no court which has jurisdiction unless there is a valid international contract in dispute .
If you know it is Admiralty Jurisdiction , and they have admitted on the record that you are in an Admiralty Court , you can demand that the international maritime contract , to which you are supposedly a party , and which you supposedly have breached , be placed into evidence .
No court has Admiralty / Maritime Jurisdiction unless there is a valid international maritime contract that has been breached .
So you say , just innocently like a lamb , " Well , I never knew that I got involved with an international maritime contract , so I deny that such a contract exists .
If this court is taking jurisdiction in Admiralty , then place the contract in evidence , so that I may challenge the validity of the contract .
What they would have to do is place the national debt into evidence .
They would have to admit that the international bankers own the whole nation , and that we are their slaves .
NOT EXPEDIENT
But the bankers said it is not expedient at this time to admit that they own everything and could foreclose on every nation of the world .
The reason they do n't want to tell everyone that they own everything is that there are still too many privately owned guns .
There are uncooperative armies and other military forces .
So until they can gradually consolidate all armies into a WORLD ARMY and all courts into a single WORLD COURT , it is not expedient to admit the jurisdiction the courts are operating under .
When we understand these things , we realize that there are certain secrets they do n't want to admit , and we can use this to our benefit .
JURISDICTION
The Constitution of the united States mentions three areas of jurisdiction in which the courts may operate : Common Law Common Law is based on God 's Law .
Anytime someone is charged under the Common Law , there must be a damaged party .
You are free under the Common Law to do anything you please , as long as you do not infringe on the life , liberty , or property of someone else .
You have a right to make a fool of yourself provided you do not infringe on the life , liberty , or property of someone else .
The Common Law does not allow for any government action which prevents a man from making a fool of himself .
For instance , when you cross over state lines in most states , you will see a sign which says , " BUCKLE YOUR SEAT BELTS -- IT'S THE LAW . '
This cannot be Common Law , because who would you injure if you did not buckle up ?
Nobody .
This would be compelled performance .
But Common Law cannot compel performance .
Any violation of Common Law is a CRIMINAL ACT , and is punishable .
Equity Law Equity
Law is law which compels performance .
It compels you to perform to the exact letter of any contract that you are under .
So , if you have compelled performance , there must be a contract somewhere , and you are being compelled to perform under the obligation of the contract .
Now this can only be a civil action - - not criminal .
In Equity Jurisdiction , you cannot be tried criminally , but you can be compelled to perform to the letter of a contract .
If you then refuse to perform as directed by the court , you can be charged with contempt of court , which is a criminal action .
Are our seatbelt laws Equity laws ?
No , they are not , because you cannot be penalized or punished for not keeping to the letter of a contract .
Admiralty / Maritime Law
This is a civil jurisdiction of Compelled Performance which also has Criminal Penalties for not adhering to the letter of the contract , but this only applies to International Contracts .
Now we can see what jurisdiction the seatbelt laws ( and all traffic laws , building codes , ordinances , tax codes , etc. ) are under .
Whenever there is a penalty for failure to perform ( such as willful failure to file ) , that is Admiralty / Maritime Law and there must be a valid international contract in force .
However , the courts do n't want to admit that they are operating under Admiralty / Maritime Jurisdiction , so they took the international law or Law Merchant and adopted it into our codes .
That is what the supreme Court decided in the Erie Railroad case -- that the decisions will be based on commercial law or business law and that it will have criminal penalties associated with it .
Since they were instructed not to call it Admiralty Jurisdiction , they call it Statutory Jurisdiction .
COURTS OF CONTRACT
You may ask how we got into this situation where we can be charged with failure to wear seatbelts and be fined for it .
Is n't the judge sworn to uphold the Constitution ?
Yes , he is .
But you must understand that the Constitution , in Article I , Section 10 , gives us the unlimited right to contract , as long as we do not infringe on the life , liberty or property of someone else .
Contracts are enforceable , and the Constitution gives two jurisdictions where contracts can be enforced -- Equity or Admiralty .
But we find them being enforced in Statutory Jurisdiction .
This is the embarrassing part for the courts , but we can use this to box the judges into a corner in their own courts .
We will cover this more later .
CONTRACTS MUST BE VOLUNTARY
Under the Common Law , every contract must be entered into knowingly , voluntarily , and intentionally by both parties or it is void and unenforceable .
These are characteristics of a Common Law contract .
There is another characteristic -- it must be based on substance .
For example , contracts used to read , " For one dollar and other valuable considerations , I will paint your house , etc . "
That was a valid contract -- the dollar was a genuine , silver dollar .
Now , suppose you wrote a contract that said , - For one Federal Reserve Note and other considerations , I will paint your house ....'
And suppose , for example , I painted your house the wrong color .
Could you go into a Common Law court and get justice ?
No , you could not .
You see , a Federal Reserve Note is a " colorable " dollar , as it has no substance , and in a Common Law jurisdiction , that contract would be unenforceable .
COLORABLE MONEY / COLORABLE COURTS
The word " colorable " means something that appears to be genuine , but is not .
Maybe it looks like a dollar , and maybe it spends like a dollar , but if it is not redeemable for lawful money ( silver or gold ) it is colorable . '
If a Federal Reserve Note is used in a contract , then the contract becomes a " colorable " contract .
And " colorable " contracts must be enforced under a " colorable " jurisdiction .
So by creating Federal Reserve Notes , the government had to create a jurisdiction to cover the kinds of contracts which use them .
We now have what is called Statutory Jurisdiction , which is not a genuine Admiralty jurisdiction .
It is " colorable " Admiralty Jurisdiction the judges are enforcing because we are using " colorable money . "
Colorable Admiralty is now known as Statutory Jurisdiction .
Let 's see how we got under this Statutory Jurisdiction .
UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE
The government set up a " colorable " law system to fit the " colorable " currency .
It used to be called the Law Merchant or the Law of Redeemable Instruments , because it dealt with paper which was redeemable in something of substance .
But , once Federal Reserve Notes had become unredeemable , there had to be a system of law which was completely " colorable " from start to finish .
This system of law was codified as the Uniform Commercial Code , and has been adopted in every state .
This is " colorable " law , and it is used in all the courts .
I explained one of the keys earlier , which is that the country is bankrupt and we have no rights .
If the master says " Jump ! " then the slave had better jump , because the master has the right to cut his head off .
As slaves we have no rights .
But the creditors / masters had to cover that up , so they created a system of law called the Uniform Commercial Code .
This - colorable ' jurisdiction under the Uniform Commercial Code is the next key to understanding what has happened .
CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT
One difference between Common Law and the Uniform Commercial Code is that in Common Law , contracts must be entered into : ( 1 ) knowingly , ( 2 ) voluntarily , and ( 3 ) intentionally .
Under the U.C.C. , this is not so .
First of all , con-tracts are un-necessary .
Under this new law , - agreements ' can be binding , and if you only exercise the benefits of a - agreement , ' it is presumed or implied that you intend to meet the obligations associated with those benefits .
If you accept a benefit offered by government , then you are obligated to follow , to the letter , each and every statute involved with that benefit .
The method has been to get everybody exercising a benefit , and they do n't even have to tell the people what the benefit is .
Some people think it is the driver 's license , the marriage license or the birth certificate , etc .
I believe it is none of these .
COMPELLED BENEFIT
I believe the benefit being used is that we have been given the privilege of discharging debt with limited liability , instead of paying debt .
When we pay a debt , we give substance for substance .
If I buy a quart of milk with a silver dollar , that dollar bought the milk , and the milk bought the dollar - - substance for substance .
But if I use a Federal Reserve Note to buy the milk , I have not paid for it .
There is no substance in the Federal Reserve Note
It is worthless paper given in exchange for something of substantive value .
Congress offers us this benefit : Debt money , created by the federal United States , can be spent all over the continental united States , it will be legal tender for all debts , public and private , and the limited liability is that you cannot be sued for not paying your debts .
So now they have said , " We 're going to help you out , and you can just discharge your debts instead of paying your debts . "
When we use this - colorable ' money to discharge our debts , we can not use a Common Law court .
We can only use a " colorable " court .
We are completely under the jurisdiction of the Uniform Commercial Code -- we are using non-redeemable negotiable instruments and we are discharging debt rather than paying debt .
REMEDY AND RECOURSE
Every system of civilized law must have two characteristics : Remedy and Recourse .
Remedy is a way to get out from under that law .
The Recourse is if you have been damaged under the law , you can recover your loss .
The Common Law , the Law of Merchants , and even the Uniform Commercial Code all have remedy and recourse , but for a long time we could not find it .
If you go to a law library and ask to see the Uniform Commercial Code , they will show you a shelf of books completely filled with the Uniform Commercial Code .
When you pick up one volume and start to read it , it will seem to have been intentionally written to be confusing .
It took us a long time to discover where the Remedy and Recourse are found in the UCC .
They are found right in the first volume , at 1-207 and 1 -103 .
REMEDY
The making of a valid Reservation of Rights preserves whatever rights the person then possesses , and prevents the loss of such rights by application of concepts of waiver or estoppel .
( UCC 1-207.7 )
It is important to remember when we go into a court , that we are in a commercial , international jurisdiction .
If we go into court and say , " I DEMAND MY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS , " the judge will most likely say , " You mention the Constitution again , and I 'll find you in contempt of court ! "
Then we do n't understand how he can do that .
Has n't he sworn to uphold the Constitution ?
The rule here is : you cannot be charged under one jurisdiction , and defend under another .
For example , if the French government came to you and asked where you filed your French income tax in a certain year , do you go to the French government and say , " I demand my Constitutional Rights ? "
No .
The proper answer is : THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY TO ME-- I'M NOT A FRENCHMAN .
You must make your reservation of rights under the jurisdiction in which you are charged - - not under some other jurisdiction .
So in a UCC court , you must claim your reservation of rights under the U.C.C. 1-207 .
UCC 1-207 goes on to say :
When a waivable right or claim is involved , the failure to make a reservation thereof , causes a loss of the right , and bars its assertion at a later date .
( UCC 1-207.9 )
You have to make your claim known early .
Further , it says : The Sufficiency of the Reservation -- Any expression indicating an intention to reserve rights , is sufficient , such as " without prejudice " .
( UCC 1-207.4 )
Whenever you sign any legal paper that deals with Federal Reserve Notes -- in any way , shape or manner -- under your signature write : Without Prejudice UCC 1-207 .
This reserves your rights .
You can show , at 1 - 207.4 , that you have sufficiently reserved your rights .
It is very important to understand just what this means .
For example , one man who used this in regard to a traffic ticket was asked by the judge just what he meant by writing - without prejudice UCC 1 - 207 ' on his statement to the court .
He had not tried to understand the concepts involved .
He only wanted to use it to get out of the ticket .
He did not know what it meant .
When the judge asked him what he meant by signing in that way , he told the judge that he was not prejudiced against anyone ....
The judge knew that the man had no idea what it meant , and he lost the case .
You must know what it means .
WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1 -207
When you use - without prejudice ' UCC 1-207 in connection with your signature , you are saying : - I reserve my right not to be compelled to perform under any contract or commercial agreement that I did not enter knowingly , voluntarily and intentionally .
And furthermore , I do not accept the liability of the compelled benefit of any unrevealed contract or commercial agreement . '
What is the compelled performance of an unrevealed commercial agreement ?
When you use Federal Reserve Notes instead of silver dollars , is it voluntary ?
No .
There is no lawful money , so you have to use Federal Reserve Notes - - you have to accept the benefit .
The government has given you the benefit to discharge your debts with limited liability , and you do n't have to pay your debts .
How nice they are !
But if you did not reserve your rights under 1 -207.7 , you are compelled to accept the benefit , and are therefore obligated to obey every statute , ordinance and regulation of the government , at all levels of government -- federal , state and local .
If you understand this , you will be able to explain it to the judge when he asks .
And he will ask , so be prepared to explain it to the court .
You will also need to understand UCC 1-103 -- the argument and recourse .
If you want to understand this fully , go to a law library and photocopy these two sections from the UCC .
It is important to get the Anderson edition .
Some of the law libraries will only have the West Publishing version , and it is very difficult to understand .
In Anderson , it is broken down with decimals into ten parts and , most importantly , it is written in plain English .
RECOURSE
The Recourse appears in the Uniform Commercial Code at 1-103.6 , which says : The Code is complimentary to the Common Law , which remains in force , except where displaced by the code .
A statute should be construed in harmony with the Common Law , unless there is a clear legislative intent to abrogate the Common Law .
This is the argument we use in court .
The Code recognizes the Common Law .
If it did not recognize the Common Law , the government would have had to admit that the United States is bankrupt , and is completely owned by its creditors .
But , it is not expedient to admit this , so the Code was written so as not to abolish the Common Law entirely .
Therefore , if you have made a sufficient , timely , and explicit reservation of your rights at 1 -207 , you may then insist that the statutes be construed in harmony with the Common Law .
If the charge is a traffic ticket , you may demand that the court produce the injured person who has filed a verified complaint .
If , for example , you were charged with failure to buckle your seatbelt , you may ask the court who was injured as a result of your failure to ' buckle up . '
However , if the judge wo n't listen to you and just moves ahead with the case , then you will want to read to him the last sentence of 1-103.6 , which states :
The Code can not be read to preclude a Common Law action .
Tell the judge , - Your Honor , I can sue you under the Common Law , for violating my right under the Uniform Commercial Code . '
I have a remedy , under the UCC , to reserve my rights under the Common Law .
I have exercised the remedy , and now you must construe this statute in harmony with the Common Law .
To be in harmony with the Common Law , you must come forth with the damaged party . '
If the judge insists on proceeding with the case , just act confused and ask this question : - Let me see if I understand , Your Honor :
Has this court made a legal determination that the sections 1-207 and 1-103 of the Uniform Commercial Code , which is the system of law you are operating under , are not valid law before this court ? '
Now the judge is in a jamb !
How can the court throw out one part of the Code and uphold another ?
If he answers , - yes , ' then you say : - I put this court on notice that I am appealing your legal determination . '
Of course , the higher court will uphold the Code on appeal .
The judge knows this , so once again you have boxed him into a corner .
PRACTICAL APPLICATION --TRAFFIC COURT
Just so we can understand how this whole process works , let us look at a court situation such as a traffic violation .
Assume you ran through a yellow light and a policeman gave you a traffic ticket .
1 . The first thing you want to do is to delay the action at least three weeks .
This you can do by being pleasant and cooperative with the officer .
Explain to him that you are very busy and ask if he could please set your court appearance for about three weeks away .
( At this point we need to remember the government 's trick : - I 'm from the government , I 'm here to help you . '
Now we want to use this approach with them . )
2 . The next step is to go to the clerk of the traffic court and say , - I believe it would be helpful if I talk to you , because I want to save the government some money ( this will gets his attention ) .
I am undoubtedly going to appeal this case .
As you know , in an appeal , I have to have a transcript , but the traffic court does n't have a court reporter .
It would be a waste of taxpayer 's money to run me through this court and then to have to give me a trial de novo in a court of record .
I do need a transcript for appealing , and to save the government some money , maybe you could schedule me to appear in a court of record . '
You can show the date on the ticket and the clerk will usually agree that there is plenty of time to schedule your trial for a court of record .
Now your first appearance is in a court of record and not in a traffic court , where there is no record .
When you get into court there will be a court reporter there who records every word the judge speaks , so the judge is much more careful in a court of record .
You will be in a much better situation there than in a traffic court .
If there is no record , the judge can say whatever he wants -- he can call you all sorts of names and tell you that you have no rights , and so on -- and deny it all later .
3 . When you get into court , the judge will read the charges : driving through a yellow light , or whatever , and this is a violation of ordinance XYZ .
He will ask , - Do you understand the charge against you ? '
4 . - Well , Your Honor , there is a question I would like to ask before I can make a plea of innocent or guilty .
I think it could be answered if I could put the officer on the stand for a moment and ask him a few short questions . '
Judge : - I do n't see why not .
Let 's swear the officer in and have him take the stand . '
5 . - Is this the instrument that you gave me ? ' ( handing him the traffic citation )
Officer : - Yes , this is a copy of it .
The judge has the other portion of it . '
- Where did you get my address that you wrote on that citation ? '
Officer : - Well , I got it from your driver 's license . '
( Handing the officer your driver 's license )
Is this the document you copied my name and address from ? '
Officer : - Yes , this is where I got it . '
- While you 've got that in your hand , would you read the signature that 's on that license ? '
( The officer reads the signature ) - While you 're there , would you read into the record what it says under the signature ? '
Officer : - It says , ' Without prejudice , UCC 1-207 . ''
Judge : -' Let me see that license ! '
( He looks at it and turns to the officer ) - You did n't notice this printing under the signature on this license , when you copied his name and address onto the ticket ? '
Officer : - Oh , no .
I was just getting the address -- I did n't look down there . '
Judge : - You 're not very observant as an officer .
Therefore , I 'm afraid I cannot accept your testimony in regards to the facts of this case .
This case is dismissed . '
6 . In this case , the Judge found a convenient way out -- he could say that the officer was not observant enough to be a reliable witness .
He did not want to admit the real nature of the jurisdiction of his court .
Once it was in the record that you had written ' Without prejudice ' UCC 1-207 on your license , the judge knew that he would have to admit that : a . you had reserved your Common Law rights under the UCC ; b. you had done it sufficiently by writing ' Without prejudice ' UCC 1-207 on your driver 's license ; c. the statute would now have to be read in harmony with the Common Law , and the Common Law says the statute exists , but there is no injured party ; and d. since there is no injured party or complaining witness , the court has no jurisdiction under the Common Law .
7 . If the judge tries to move ahead and try the facts of the case , then you will want to ask him the following question : Your Honor , let me understand this correctly : has this court made a legal determination that it has authority under the jurisdiction that it is operating under , to ignore two sections of the Uniform Commercial Code which have been called to its attention ?
If he says yes , tell him that you put the court on notice that you will appeal that legal determination , and that if you are damaged by his actions , you will sue him in a common law action -- under the jurisdiction of the UCC .
This will work just as well with the Internal Revenue Service .
In fact , we can use the UCC with the IRS before we get to court .
USING THE CODE WITH THE IRS
If the IRS sends you a Notice of Deficiency , this is called a presentment ' in the Uniform Commercial Code .
A - presentment ' in the UCC is very similar to the Common Law .
First we must understand just how this works in the Common Law .
Suppose I get a man 's name from a phone book -- someone I have never met .
And I send him a bill or invoice on nice letterhead which says , - For services rendered : $ 10,000.00 . '
I send this by Certified Mail to him at the address taken from the phone book .
The man has to sign for it before he can open it , so I get a receipt that he received it .
When he opens it , he finds an invoice for $ 10,000 and the following statement : - If you have any questions concerning this bill or the services rendered , you have thirty days to make your questions or objections known . '
Of course , he has never heard of me , so he just throws the bill away and assumes that I 'm confused or crazy .
At the end of thirty days , I go to court and get a default judgment against him .
He received a bill for $ 10,000 , was given thirty days to respond .
He failed to object to it or ask any questions about it .
Now he has defaulted on the bill and I can lawfully collect the $ 10,000 .
That 's Common Law .
The UCC works on the same principle .
The minute you get a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS , you return it immediately with a letter that says :
The presentment above is dishonored .
your name has reserved all of his / her rights under the Uniform Commercial Code at UCC 1 -207 .
This should be all that is necessary , as there is nothing more that they can do .
In fact , I recently helped someone in Arizona who received a Notice of Deficiency .
The man sent a letter such as this , dishonoring the ' presentment . '
The IRS wrote back that they could not make a determination at that office , but were turning it over to the Collections Department .
A letter was attached from the Collections Department which said they were sorry for the inconvenience they had caused him and that the Notice of Deficiency had been withdrawn .
So you can see that if it is handled properly , these things are easily resolved .
IMPENDING BANKRUPTCY
On my way here , I had a chance to visit with the Governor of Wyoming .
He is very concerned that if he runs for office this November , that there wo n't be a State of Wyoming at the end of four years .
He believes that the International Bankers might foreclose on the nation and officially admit that they own the whole world .
They could round up everybody in the state capitol building , put them in an internment camp and hold them indefinitely .
They may give them a trial , or they may not .
They will do whatever they want .
As I explained earlier , it has not been expedient to foreclose on the nation until they could get everything ready .
This is where the Federal Emergency Management Agency comes in .
It has been put in place without anyone really noticing it .
FEMA FEMA , or the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been designed for when America is officially declared bankrupt , which would be a national emergency .
In a national emergency , all Constitutional Rights and all law that previously existed , would be suspended .
FEMA has created large concentration camps where they would put anyone who might cause trouble for the orderly plan and process of the new regime to take over the nation .
Even a governor could be thrown into one of these internment camps , and kept there indefinitely .
This is all in place now , and they are just waiting to declare a national emergency .
Then even state governments could be dissolved .
Anybody who might oppose the new regime could be imprisoned until a new set of laws could be written and a new government set up .
The Governor knows all this , and he is very concerned .
He does n't want to be in office when all this happens .
I visited with him and I told him that there are certain action we should take right now .
I think we should consider the fact that , according to the Uniform Commercial Code , Wyoming is an accommodation party to the national debt .
To under - stand this we must realize that there are two separate entities known as the United States .
THE ROTHSCHILD INFLUENCE
When America was founded , the Rothschilds were very unhappy because it was founded on the Common Law .
The Common Law is based on substance , and this substance is mentioned in the Constitution as gold or silver .
America is a Constitutional Republic -- that is : a union of the States under the Constitution .
When Congress was working for the Republic , the only thing it could borrow was gold or silver , and the Rothschild banks did not loan gold or silver .
Naturally , they did not like this new government .
The Rothschilds had a deal with the King of England .
He would borrow paper and agree to repay in gold .
But these united States , with their Constitution , were an obstacle to them , and it was much to the Rothschild 's advantage to get the colonies back under the King .
So the Rothschilds financed the War of 1812 to bring America back under England .
Of course , that did n't work , so they had to find another way .
THE FLAW IN THE CONSTITUTION : TWO NATIONS IN ONE
It was around the time of the American Civil War that they discovered a flaw in the Constitution .
The flaw was Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17 .
Remember that there are two nations called - United States . '
What is a nation ?
See if you would agree to this definition :
Whenever you have a governing body , having a prescribed territory containing a body of people .
Is that a nation ?
Yes .
We have a governing body in the Republic -- the three branch government .
There are the legislative , the executive and the judicial branches , with a constitution .
There is a prescribed territory containing a body of people .
This is a Constitutional Republic .
But , Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17 gave Congress , which is the legislative branch of the three branch government , exclusive rule over a given territory known as the District of Columbia , containing a body of people .
Here we have a nation within a nation .
This is a legislative democracy within a Constitutional Republic .
When Congress was a part of the Constitutional Republic , it had the obligation of providing a medium of exchange for us .
Its duty was to coin gold or silver .
Anyone who had a piece of gold or silver could bring it in and have it freely minted into coin .
This was the medium of exchange for the Republic .
But , in the Legislative Democracy ( over Washington D. C. ) , Congress is not limited by the Constitution .
Congress has exclusive rule over the District of Columbia .
The legislators can make the law by a majority vote -- that makes it a democracy ; they have the authority to have administrative agents to enforce their own law ; and they have courts in the legislative branch of government , to try their own law .
Here we have the legislature making the law , enforcing the law and trying the law , all within the one branch of government .
This is a one branch government within a three branch government .
Under the three branch government , the congress passes law which has to be in harmony with the Constitution , the executive enforces the law passed by the congress , and the judiciary tries the law , pursuant to the Constitution .
THE THREE BRANCH CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC and the ONE BRANCH LEGISLATIVE DEMOCRACY are both called THE UNITED STATES .
One is the federal United States , and the other is the continental united States .
ARE YOU A UNITED STATES CITIZEN ?
If you say that you are a United States citizen , which United States are you referring to ?
Anyone who lives in the District of Columbia is a United States citizen .
The remaining population in the fifty states is the national citizenry of the nation .
We are domiciled in various sovereign states , protected by the constitutions of those states from any direct rule of Congress over us .
In the democracy , anyone who lives in those states known as Washington D.C. , Guam , Puerto Rico , or any of the other federally held territories is a citizen of the United States [ D.C. ] .
We must be careful with our choice of words -- we are not citizens of the United States .
We are not subject to Congress .
Congress has exclusive rule over a given territory , and we are not part of that territory .
Where did Congress get the authority to write the Internal Revenue Code ?
It is found in Article I , Section 8 , Clause 17 of the Constitution .
To pass that law , they only needed a majority vote .
There is no other way that they could pass laws directly affecting individuals .
Title 26 , the Internal Revenue Code , was passed as law for another nation ( remember our definition of ' nation ' ) , but Title 26 is not consistent with the Bill of Rights .
If you try to fight the IRS , you have no rights -- the Code does not give you any of your constitutional rights .
It simply says , - You failed to file an income tax form -- you failed to perform in some specific manner . '
Remember , under the Common Law , you are free to do whatever you want as long as you do not infringe upon the life , liberty or property of anyone else .
If you do not want to perform , you do n't have to .
The only way you can be compelled to perform under the Constitution in the continental united States , is if you have entered a contract .
But if you are not under a contract you can not be compelled to perform .
How can you be compelled to file an income tax form , or any form ?
When Congress works for the Republic , every law it passes must be in harmony with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , but when Congress works for the Legislative Democracy , any law it passes becomes the law of the land ( remember , Congress has exclusive legislative control over federal territory ) .
If you are charged with Willful failure to file an income tax 1040 form , that is a law for a different nation .
You are a non-resident alien to that nation .
It is a foreign corporation to you .
It is not the Republic of the continental united States coming after you , it is a foreign nation - - a legislative democracy of a foreign nation coming after you .
If you get a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS , it is a presentment from the federal United States , and then you can use the UCC to dishonor it , and you can also mention that you are among the national citizenry of continental united States , and you are a non-resident alien to the federal United States .
You never lived in a federal territory and never had any income from the federal United States .
Furthermore , you cannot be required to file or pay taxes under the compelled benefit of using the Federal Reserve Notes , because you have reserved your rights under the Common Law through the Uniform Commercial Code at 1-207 .
ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE FOUNDERS
The Founding Fathers would never have created a government that was going to boss them around !
There were 13 sovereign States .
They were nations , and they joined together for protection from foreign enemies .
They provided a means by which the union of the sovereign states could fend off foreign enemies .
But they never gave the congress of the federal United States direct rule over any citizen of any state .
They were not going to be ordered around by that government they set up .
FEDERAL REGIONS
The supreme Court has declared that Congress can rule what Congress creates .
Congress did not create the States , but Congress did create federal regions .
So Congress can rule the federal regions , but Congress can not rule the States .
How have we been tricked into federal regions ?
THE ZIP CODE TRICK Remember how the government always comes to us and says , - I 'm from the government and I 'm here to help you . '
The government went out into the various states and said , - We do n't want you to have to go to all that trouble of writing three or four letters to abbreviate the name of the state -- such as Ariz . for Arizona .
Just write AZ , instead of Ariz .
Or you can just write WY for Wyoming instead of Wyo . '
So all of the states of the union have got a new two - letter abbreviation .
Even a state such as Rhode Island has a new abbreviation .
It is RI , instead of R.I .
They have just left off the periods .
When you use a two - letter state abbreviation , you are compelled to use a zip code , because there are so many states , for example , which start with M. ME is Maine -- MI is Michigan .
How many people dot every ' i ' , or make an ' i ' that looks like an 'e ' ?
With MA , MO , MN , MS , etc. , and some sloppy writing , and you could not tell one from another .
So , we have to use the zip code in order to tell them apart .
But if you wrote Mich. , or Minn. , or Miss. , there would be no real problem telling which state it was .
There is no harm in using the zip code , if you lawfully identify your state .
I found out that no state legislature has met to lawfully change the abbreviation of the state from the old abbreviation to the new .
Therefore , if you do not use the lawful abbreviation for your state , but use the shorter new abbreviation , you have to use the zip code .
Look on page 11 of the Zip Code Directory , and it will tell you that the first digit of your zip code is the federal region in which you reside .
If you use AZ for Arizona , you cannot use the state constitution to protect you because you did not identify your state .
You used the zip code , which identifies which federal region you live in .
And Congress may rule directly federal regions , but it cannot rule the citizens of any state .
ACCOMMODATION PARTY
Let 's look at how the states have become the accommodation party to the national debt .
There are many people I have talked to , including the Governor , who are very concerned about this , and who know that it could happen very soon .
If America is declared a bankrupt nation , it will be a national emergency .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency will take over , and anyone who opposes the new government of the creditors can be sent to a detention camp in Alaska .
We will have no rights whatsoever .
They have already set up prison camps with work camps nearby so the people can be used for slave labor .
It could be the governors , legislators , and other leaders who would be hauled away to Alaska , while the people now disenfranchised from power would likely be chosen to run the new government .
This could all happen very soon , as the national debt is so large as to be unpayable .
Even the interest on the debt is virtually unpayable .
As I explained , the national debt -- more than three trillion dollars -- is not owed by the Continental united States .
It is the federal United States that had authority to borrow bank credit .
When Congress worked for Continental united States , it could only borrow gold or silver , so the national debt was borrowed in the name of the federal United States .
The federal United states has been bankrupt since 1938 , but the federal United States had to trap the States into assuming the debt obligation of the federal debt .
In the Uniform Commercial Code , we find the term , ' accommodation party . '
How did the states become the ' accommodation party ' to the federal debt ?
The federal government , through our money system , made the states deal in Federal Reserve Notes , which means that everything the states do is ' colorable . '
Under the ' colorable ' jurisdiction of the Uniform Commercial Code , all of the states are the accommodation party to the federal debt .
Now the concern is to find out how we can get out of this situation .
I told the Governor that in the Common Law and the Law of Merchants -- that 's the International Law Merchant -- there is a term called no -interest contract .
A no-interest contract is void and unenforceable .
What is a no-interest contract ?
NO - INTEREST CONTRACT
If I were to insure a house that did not belong to me , that would be a no-interest contract .
I would just want the house to burn down .
I would pay a small premium , perhaps a few hundred dollars , and insure it for 80,000 dollars against fire .
Then I would be waiting for it to burn so I could trade my small premium for $ 80,000 .
Under the Common Law and under international law of the Law Merchant , that is called a no- interest contract , and it is void and unenforceable in any court .
UNCONSCIONABLE CONTRACTS
In the Uniform Commercial Code , no-interest contracts are called unconscionable contracts .
The section on unconscionable contracts covers more than forty pages in the Anderson Code .
The federal United States has involved the states as the accommodation party to the federal debt , and I believe we could prove this to be an unconscionable contract .
We should get some litigation into the courts before the government declares a national emergency , claiming that this state has no lawful responsibility for the national debt ( of the federal United States ) , because it became an accommodation party to this debt through an unconscionable contract .
If we have this litigation before the courts under International Law when the nation is declared bankrupt , the creditors would have to settle this matter first , and it would delay them .
They would want the new government to appear to be legitimate , so they could not just move right in and take over the state , because it would be in an International Court .
This is very important at this time .
QUESTIONS AND REVIEW
Note :
These are some of the questions asked after the main lecture .
Some are restatements of material presented earlier , but they contain very valuable information which is worth repeating .
COURTROOM TECHNIQUES
Question :
How did you - box in ' the Judge ?
Answer :
This is easy to do if you do n't know too much .
I did n't know too much , but I boxed them in .
You must play a little dumb .
If you are arrested and you go into court , just remember that in a criminal action , you have to understand the law or it is a reversible error for the court to try you .
If you do n't understand the law , they can't try you .
In any traffic case or tax case you are called into court and the judge reads the law and then asks , - Do you understand the charges ? '
Defendant : No , Your Honor , I do not .
Judge :
Well , what 's so difficult about that charge ?
Either you drove the wrong way on a one - way street or you did n't .
You can only go one way on that street , and if you go the other way it 's a fifty dollar fine .
What 's so difficult about this that you do n't understand ?
Defendant : Well , Your Honor , it 's not the letter of the law , but rather the nature of the law that I do n't understand .
The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution gives me the right to request the court to explain the nature of any action against me , and upon my request , the court has the duty to answer .
I have a question about the nature of this action .
Judge : Well , what is that -- what do you want to know ?
Always ask them some easy questions first , as this establishes that they are answering .
You ask : Defendant : Well , Your Honor , is this a Civil or a Criminal Action ?
Judge :
It is criminal .
( If it were a civil action there could be no fine , so it has to be criminal ) Defendant : Thank you , Your Honor , for telling me that .
Then the record will show that this action against ( your name ) is a criminal action , is that right ?
Judge : Yes .
Defendant : I would like to ask another question about this criminal action .
There are two criminal jurisdictions mentioned in the Constitution : one is under the Common Law , and the other deals with International Maritime Contracts , under an Admiralty Jurisdiction .
Equity is Civil , and you said this is a Criminal action , so it seems it would have to be under either the Common Law , or Maritime Law .
But what puzzles me , Your Honor , is that there is no corpus delecti here that gives this court a jurisdiction over my person and property under the Common Law .
Therefore , it does n't appear to me that this court is moving under the Common Law .
Judge :
No , I can assure you this court is not moving under the Common Law .
Defendant :
Well , thank you , Your Honor , but now you make the charge against me even more difficult to understand .
The only other criminal jurisdiction would apply only if there was an International Maritime Contract involved , I was a party to it , it had been breached , and the court was operating in an Admiralty Jurisdiction .
I do n't believe I have ever been under any International Maritime contract , so I would deny that one exists .
I would have to demand that such a contract , if it does exist , be placed into evidence , so that I may contest it .
But surely , this court is not operating under an Admiralty Jurisdiction .
You just put the words in the judges mouth .
Judge :
No , I can assure you , we 're not operating under an Admiralty Jurisdiction .
We 're not out in the ocean somewhere -- we 're right here in the middle of the State of __( any state ) ___ .
No , this is not an Admiralty Jurisdiction .
Defendant : Thank you Your Honor , but now I am more puzzled than ever .
If this charge is not under the Common Law , or under Admiralty -- and those are the only two criminal jurisdictions mentioned in the Constitution -- what kind of jurisdiction could this court be operating under ?
Judge : It 's Statutory Jurisdiction .
Defendant : Oh , thank you , Your Honor .
I 'm glad you told me that .
But I have never heard of that jurisdiction .
So , if I have to defend under that , I would need to have the Rules of Criminal Procedure for Statutory Jurisdiction .
Can you tell me where I might find those rules ?
There are no rules for Statutory Jurisdiction , so the judge will get very angry at this point and say : Judge :
If you want answers to questions like that , you get yourself a licensed attorney - - I 'm not allowed to practice law from the bench .
Defendant : Oh , Your Honor , I do n't think anyone would accuse you of practicing law from the bench if you just answer a few questions to explain to me nature of this action , so that I may defend myself .
Judge : I told you before , I am not going to answer any more questions .
Do you understand that ?
If you ask any more questions in regards to this , I 'm going to find you in contempt of court !
Now if you can't afford a licensed attorney , the court will provide you with one .
But if you want those questions answered , you must get yourself a licensed attorney .
Defendant : Thank you , Your Honor , but let me just see if I got this straight .
Has this court made a legal determination that it has authority to conduct a criminal action against me , the accused , under a secret jurisdiction , the rules of which are known only to this court and licensed attorneys , thereby denying me the right to defend in my own person ?
He has no answer for that .
The judge will probably postpone the case and eventually just let it go .
In this way , you can be as wise as a serpent and as harmless as a dove , but you must n't go into court with a chip on you shoulder and as a wolf in - black sheep ' country .
Remember Jesus ' words , - I send you out as sheep in wolf country , be wise as a serpent , and harmless as a dove . '
Sheep do not attack wolves directly .
Just be an innocent little lamb who just can't understand the charge , and remember -- they can't try you criminally if you do n't understand the charge .
That would be automatically a reversible error on appeal .
THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROBLEM
If I were a young man , 18 or 20 years old and just starting out in my first job , I would not want Social Security .
With my signature on the application I would write , ' Without prejudice ' UCC 1 -207 , and I would reserve my Common Law rights .
But why would n't I want Social Security today ?
I got into the Social Security system in the 1930's , and I paid into it dollars that had good purchasing power .
Now I 'm getting a promised return in Federal Reserve Notes which have considerably less value .
For example , in 1940 , you could buy a deluxe Chevrolet for 800 dollars .
With today 's Federal Reserve Notes , that wo n't buy the rear fenders and trunk on a new Chevrolet .
If I were a young man , I would not want to put Federal Reserve Notes into Social Security now , and get back something later like the German mark after World War I -- when it took a billion to buy a loaf of bread .
They will give you every Federal Reserve Note back that they promised you , but it might not buy anything .
ASSURANCE
Under the Uniform Commercial Code , you have the right in any agreement , to demand a guarantee of performance .
So , do n't go to them and say , - I want to rescind my Social Security number , ' or - I refuse to take it . '
Just take it easy and say , - I would be happy to get a Social Security number and enter into this contract , but I have a little problem .
How can I have assurance before I enter into this contract that the purchasing power of the Federal Reserve Notes I get back at the end of the contract will be as good as the ones that I pay in at the beginning .
They can't guarantee that , and you have a right under the UCC to assurance of performance under the contract .
So tell them , Well , I can not enter this contract unless the government will guarantee to pay me at the end of the contract with the same value Federal Reserve Notes that I 'm paying in .
Both may be called Federal Reserve Notes , but you know that these Federal Reserve Notes do n't hold their value .
I want assurance on this contract that the Federal Reserve Notes that I get in my retirement will buy as much as the ones that I 'm giving you now in my working years . '
They can't make that guarantee .
If they wo n't give you that guarantee , just say , - I 'd be glad to sign this , but if you can't guarantee performance under the contract , I 'm afraid I can not enter the contract .
Now , did you refuse or did they refuse ?
You can get the sections of the Uniform Commercial Code which grant the right to have assurance that the contract you have entered will be fulfilled properly -- that the return will equal the investment , and you can reject the contract using the Code .
Using their own system of law , you can show that they cannot make you get into a contract of that nature .
Just approach them innocently like a lamb .
It is very important to be gentle and humble in all dealings with the government or the courts -- never raise your voice or show anger .
In the courtroom , always be polite , and build the judge up -- call him ' Your Honor . '
Give him all the ' honor ' he wants .
It does no good to be difficult , but rather to be cooperative and ask questions in a way that leads the judge to say the things which you need to have in the record .
THE COURT REPORTER
In many courts , there will be a regular court reporter .
He gets his job at the judges pleasure , so he does n't want to displease the judge .
The court reporter is sworn to give an accurate transcript of every word that is spoken in the courtroom .
But if the judge makes a slip of the tongue , he turns to his court reporter and says , - I think you had better leave that out of the transcript ; just say it got a little too far ahead of you , and you could n't quite get everything in . '
So this will be missing from the transcript .
In one case , we brought a licensed court reporter with us and the judge got very angry and said , - This court has a licensed court reporter right here , and the record of this court is this court reporter 's record .
No other court reporter 's record means anything in this court . '
We responded with , - Of course , Your Honor , we 're certainly glad to use your regular court reporter .
But you know , Your Honor , sometimes things move so fast that a court reporter gets a little behind , and does n't quite keep up with it all .
Would n't it be nice if we had another licensed court reporter in the courtroom , just in case your court reporter got a little behind , so that we could fill in from this other court reporter 's data .
I 'm sure , Your Honor , that you want an accurate transcript .
( I like to use the saying ; give a bad dog a good name , and he 'll live up to it ! )
The judge went along with it , and from that moment on , he was very careful of what he said .
These are little tricks to getting around in court .
This is how to be wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove when we enter into a courtroom .
There are others using the same information presented here who end up in jail , handcuffed and hit over the head , because they approach the situation with a chip on their shoulder .
They try to tell the judge what the law is and that he is a no - good scoundrel and so on .
Just be wise and harmless .
UCC 1-207 REVIEW
It is so important to know and understand the meaning of Without prejudice ' UCC 1 -207 , in connection with your signature , that we should go over this once more .
It is very likely that a judge will ask you what it means .
So please learn and understand this carefully :
The use of -' Without prejudice ' UCC 1 -207 , ' in connection with my signature indicates that I have reserved my Common Law right not to be compelled to perform under any contract that I did not enter into knowingly , voluntarily , and intentionally .
And furthermore , I do not accept the liability associated with the compelled benefit of any un-revealed contract or commercial agreement .
Once you state that , it is all the judge needs to hear .
Under the Common Law , a contract must be entered into knowingly , voluntarily and intentionally , by both parties , or it can be declared void and unenforceable .
You are claiming the right not to be compelled to perform under any contract that you did not enter into knowingly , voluntarily and intentionally .
And you do not accept the liability associated with the compelled benefit of any unrevealed contract or agreement .
The compelled benefit is the privilege to use Federal Reserve Notes to discharge your debts with limited liability rather than to pay your debts with silver coins .
It is a compelled benefit , because there are no silver coins in circulation .
You have to eat , and you can only buy food with the medium of exchange provided by the government .
You are not allowed to print your own money , so you are compelled to use theirs .
This is the compelled benefit of an unrevealed commercial agreement .
If you have not made a valid , timely and explicit reservation of your rights under UCC 1 - 207 , and you simply exercise this benefit rendered by government , you will be obligated , under an implied agreement , to obey every statute , ordinance and regulation passed by government , at all levels -- federal , state and local .
IN CONCLUSION
The editor of this transcript has taken great liberties in putting this to paper in a effort to make it readable and somewhat compact .
He wishes to offer his gratitude to Howard Freeman for the opportunity to work with information so absolutely vital to our survival as dignified , unenslaved human beings .
He must also ask Mr. Freeman 's forgiveness for any errors committed in getting this in print .
Its purpose , as stated in the Foreword , is to make this knowledge and wisdom available to as many people as will take the time and trouble to read it .
This is meant to be supplemental to Mr. Freeman 's recorded lectures , not a substitute .
Indeed , there is no substitute for hearing him present this material in his own words .
It is not just the law and the facts that are important here , but the way they are used .
His numerous reminders of Jesus ' commission to be -... like sheep among wolves ... ' can not be overstated , and is certainly good advice to us in all dealings -- not just in court or with the government .
Hearing him explain this in his own words brings to life the practical application and usefulness of being - wise ' and - harmless . '
In fact , after being introduced to this approach , it becomes difficult to imagine that any other way of defending oneself from the government would be effective .
It goes without saying that none of this information presented here is in any way , shape or form offered as legal advice .
For that , as you know , you must - get yourself a licensed attorney . '
Having said that , I feel obliged to point out that one of the most difficult aspects of dealing with a licensed attorney -- even a good one -- may be knowing just whose side he is on ( he is , after all , an officer of the court ) !
So for those of us who have concluded that having an attorney means that you will soon be chained , gagged and lead to the gallows , this information may be in - dispensable .
For the extraordinary challenges of appearing in court in one 's own person -- pro per -- there are few reliable sources of information .
Learning to defend ourselves , that is , being responsible instead of turning over one more area of our lives to - professionals '-- may be the only way to have any chance of digging ourselves out of this pit of legal tyranny .
Perhaps the greatest problem we face in education today is the matter of widespread legal illiteracy .
Naturally , there will always be a number of people who just do n't care about these issues who either : ( 1 ) , have a soft life which is supported and maintained by this secret system of law and the institutions which have grown up around it ( ' I can make a bundle buying these IRS - seized homes cheap and reselling them ' ) , or ( 2 ) , do n't believe that anything can be done about it ( ' you ca n't fight city hall ' ) , or ( 3 ) , simply do n't have the energy or inclination to do anything about it ( ' that 's nice , but let 's see what 's on TV ' ) .
For those good ' citizens ' this whole effort may seem useless , or even threatening .
But it is this writer 's view that God did not intend for us to spend our lives in statutory slavery for the benefit of a handful of secret world manipulators , even if the ' masters ' grant us some token pleasures and diversions .
Human dignity requires much more than entertainment .
The door is there and the key exists ; we must find it and we must use it to return to freedom !
Let us discover the mistakes we have made , let us find the truth , let us apply it with meekness and wisdom and let us gently but firmly reclaim the precious freedom which we have so foolishly given up .
Throughout a long career in politics , presumptive Republican presidential nominee Sen .
John McCain has had his foreign policy shaped by his and the United States ’ experience in the Vietnam War .
But that shaping has been very dynamic  not beholden to any one particular lesson of the conflict , but rather taking each political situation presented to him and viewing it through the lens of Vietnam , often with mixed results .
The most potent example of this today is also one of the biggest campaign issues  McCain ’s support for the Iraq war .
The war , many feel , violates some of the primary lessons of Vietnam that were thought to be solidified in the Powell Doctrine of former George W. Bush secretary of state Gen. Colin Powell ( Ret. ) , who along with McCain was informed by his service in Vietnam .
The Powell Doctrine sets out requirements for US engagement in a military conflict .
Included in the criteria are US public support , clear objectives , and the use of overwhelming military force .
But just as critics use Vietnam to challenge the folly of continued occupation , McCain uses it to defend the US presence there  citing a Vietnam - era criticism of the US that it had " lost the will to fight . "
McCain ’s own military service during and after the Vietnam War was fraught with the sort of drama usually reserved for war films .
A naval aviator , McCain ’s plane was shot down over Hanoi , the capital of North Vietnam .
McCain was then taken prisoner and tortured for five years  notably refusing to be released early , out of order of capture , because of his father ’s position in the Navy .
Upon his release from captivity , McCain returned to the US as a war hero , and used the platform afforded him to support President Richard Nixon ’s escalation of the conflict and , notably , his support for the " Domino Theory "  that if South Vietnam fell to communists , a " red fever " would spread across Southeast Asia and strengthen global communism and its alleged goal of violent and forceful world domination .
" I do n’t hold him accountable for anything he said right after returning from Vietnam , " author , blogger and political consultant Cliff Schecter told IPS , citing the stress and trauma of the long captivity .
But while McCain moved away from many of his originally stated lessons on Vietnam as he went into politics , he has since returned to many of them as he has grown closer to the neoconservative movement  rehashing the old arguments to warn about the dangers of leaving Iraq even as those ideas proved to be false alarms in the case of Vietnam .
" He was a little attached to Vietnam at first , but then he learned his lesson about Vietnam , " said Schecter , calling McCain ’s worldview at the time something akin to Powell’s .
" He entered public life  in 1982 when he won his congressional seat  as a complete isolationist . "
One of the first indications of McCain ’s " maverick " status was when he broke with party ranks in 1983 to oppose President Ronald Reagan ’s plan to keep troops in Lebanon .
The vote cast was on the losing side , but troops would nevertheless be pulled when US barracks there were bombed .
Similarly , McCain opposed the use of force in Somalia and Haiti in the 1990s .
" Just like that , in 1997 and 1998 he did a complete 180 when he started hanging out with the neoconservative crowd , " said Schecter , whose book on the Arizona senator , an unsympathetic profile called The Real McCain , was recently released .
" McCain has broken with his bothers in arms to join this group of armchair warriors who theorize on blackboards and computers and have never been actually been to war . "
The allegiance with that crowd was codified in 2000 when neoconservative Randy Scheunemann was added to McCain ’s 2000 presidential bid as an advisor .
For his 2008 run , McCain has taken on Scheunemann as his foreign policy chief .
At an event at the Washington think - tank the Brookings Institution earlier this month , Scheunemann spoke of another of McCain ’s fears about a US defeat in Iraq  a weakening of US military forces .
Again , McCain ’s contention was based on the Vietnam experience of returning to active duty in command of a squadron rife with recruiting issues and planes grounded due to disrepair .
" [ McCain ] served in the military in the aftermath of defeat and saw firsthand how difficult it was to recruit and retain personnel to keep aircraft flying and so on , " said Scheunemann .
But Shecter complains that McCain and Scheunemann have it backwards ; it is the Iraq war itself that has weakened US military forces rather than the specter of defeat .
" By any real measure , the military is so unprepared right now because of the war that John McCain and George Bush and their allies thrust upon us , " said Schecter .
" We ’re much more dangerously overstretched than anything close to where we were back then . "
Perhaps the biggest gap in logic for McCain ’s use of his experience with defeat in Vietnam to bolster the war effort in Iraq is based on his contention that the US must not lose its will to fight .
" It ’s a trick because that observation assumes that the United States could have won in Vietnam if only it had not withdrawn , which is not true , " Juan Cole , professor of history at the University of Michigan and a Middle East expert , told IPS .
" Yes , it ’s very unfortunate to be defeated in a military endeavor , but it happens .
So suck it up and get over it . "
Cole insists that it is not the lessons of Vietnam , but rather that war ’s follies that are being replayed in Iraq .
" McCain and the Republicans misunderstood the North Vietnamese communists as being an international communist threat .
But they were just Vietnamese nationalists , " said Cole .
" Now these same people are misunderstanding the Sunni insurgency as an international al - Qaeda threat .
But they ’re just Sunni Arab Iraqi nationalists . "
After McCain had settled into the realist mindset as he entered politics , he played a major role in normalizing relations with Vietnam after the end of the Cold War  advocating for a US interests section in Vietnam in the early 1980s and traveling to Vietnam in the mid-1990s as part of a push for normalization made official shortly thereafter by Pres.
Bill Clinton .
" In a way that was sort of explicitly or implicitly admitting that what we did in Vietnam was an absolute waste of our time .
It was a stupid war .
It did n’t help our national security ; it injured us , " said Schecter .
" It exacerbated problems just as Iraq is doing now .
So now he throws up the same silly platitudes that were used back then about ‘ you need to win there . ’
Well , what does that mean ? "
" In the end , diplomacy is what created the situation we ’re currently in our relationship with Vietnam , " he said .
" Where are we right now ?
We ’re a trading partner of theirs . "
If the French marauders known as The Deflated waged their brand of urban subversion in Southern California , the mecca of the sport utility vehicle , by now they would probably have been jailed , beaten , shot or at least sued .
But five weeks after the clandestine crew of environmentalists launched a low - intensity war on SUVs in Paris , there are no casualties to report .
Except , of course , for dozens of deflated gas - guzzling vehicles , said Sous - Adjudant Marrant ( Sub - Warrant Officer Joker ) , the mysterious , masked leader of Les Degonfles .
Under cover of night , Marrant ’s troops target Jeep Cherokees , Porsche Cayennes and other four - wheel - drive vehicles parked on the tree - lined avenues and cobblestoned lanes of wealthy neighborhoods .
The eco -guerrillas deflate tires without damaging them , smear doors with mud and paste handbills on windshields proclaiming that the vehicles are dangerous , polluting behemoths that do not belong in the city .
“ We use the mud to say that if the owners will not take the four - wheel - drives to the countryside , we will bring the countryside to the four - wheel - drives , ” said Marrant , 28 , who uses an alias because angry drivers deluge his website , https://degonfle.blogg.org with e-mails threatening mayhem and questioning his manhood .

Although his nom de guerre was inspired by Subcommander Marcos , the masked Mexican guerrilla revered by leftists , Marrant insists he is not violent or even particularly serious .
“ Deflated ” is a self - deprecating name that also means “ coward ” in French .
The group wants to send a mischievous message while avoiding damage to the vehicles , injury and prosecution , the thin , mop - haired activist said during an interview in a corner cafe on the Seine ’s left bank , longtime turf of radicals and revolutionaries .
“ We emphasize the comic , the burlesque side , ” Marrant said with the earnest , wide - eyed look of a prankster trying to keep a straight face .
“ It would be hard to take us to court .
We do n’t slash tires , we deflate them .
Air does n’t cost anything .
As for getting cars dirty , that ’s nothing .
I would plead guilty to that .
Our rules are to never run from the police .
And always run from the owners . ”
The rise of anti-SUV activism in France shows that one man ’s vandal can be another man ’s avenger .
The deflators are on the fringe of a movement that has considerable support at City Hall , which is governed by an alliance of the Socialist and Green parties .
Christophe Delabre , the president of a French association of SUV owners , has appeared in a television debate with Marrant , who wore sunglasses , a baseball cap and a bandanna to conceal his identity .
Delabre does not find his adversary amusing .

“ It ’s comparable to extremism , to discrimination , to inciting hate , ” Delabre said .
“ You ca n’t stigmatize a category of the population with impunity under the pretext that they drive a kind of vehicle .... [ The Deflated ] put others ’ lives in danger , and that ’s unacceptable .
It ’s out of the question that this kind of action is tolerated in France .
I do n’t understand how the police can arrest deflators and let them go a few hours later . ”
Although city leaders do n’t condone vandalism , officials have gone as far as proposing that Paris ban sport utility vehicles .
Deputy Mayor Denis Baupin , who oversees transportation programs , has called the SUV “ a caricature of a car . ”
Baupin spoke during a recent rally of about 200 activists at a Jeep dealership where the manager had agreed to shut down early for the day .
The decision drew cheers from children wearing cow and buffalo masks , cyclists hoisting bikes triumphantly aloft .
“ An SUV is totally useless for Paris , ” Baupin said in his speech , blaming the recent devastating hurricanes in the U.S. on climate change caused by pollution .
“ The situation is striking :
The country that refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol suffered from a climatic catastrophe ....
We all feel sorry for the dead in New Orleans .
But now maybe the United States should start considering that their development pattern is not to be repeated worldwide and that it causes environmental problems . ”

In the United States , sport utility vehicles account for one of every four automobiles sold , but in France , SUVs represent only about 5 % of the market .
The prices are high for middle - class families , but sales jumped about 20 % last year .
Overt official hostility has encouraged antisocial attacks masquerading as activism , Delabre charged .
“ This reflects the impact of the statements made during the last two years by Mr. Baupin , ” he said .
“ He has told anyone listening , and the media helped him a lot , that four - wheel - drives should be banned .
I criticized him because that kind of talk surprised me coming from an elected representative . ”
Like other historic European capitals , Paris struggles with overwhelming traffic that challenges even the smallest cars and steeliest drivers .
Double - parked delivery trucks block narrow streets .
Swarms of motorcyclists zoom the wrong way on congested boulevards .
Parking garages , impossibly small , seem designed by sadists .

Spurred by the take - back - the - streets attitude of the Greens , City Hall is trying to discourage cars in favor of mass transit , biking and walking .
In addition , the national government has imposed a new tax on high - polluting vehicles that works out to about $ 300 per owner , but varies depending on emission levels .
And the Deflated are stepping up their stealthy fight .
Marrant is writing a children ’s song as an anthem for the cause .
He also hopes to record a dance - mix version before Saturday , when activists plan an international wave of anti-SUV operations -- by daylight , this time -- in France , Britain , Canada and Australia .
“ The point is to focus on consumers , ” he said , spewing smoke from a Gaulois cigarette into the haze shrouding the crowded cafe .
“ We have to get past the idea that there ’s always a single , identifiable villain : the president , the corporation , the chief executive .
Our campaign has to be very marketing , shocking , provocative .
I want to make it fashionable to be anti-4X4 . ”
Marrant is unemployed , though he has dabbled in journalism .
His brother works for a major European corporation .
His group numbers about 20 , he said .
They come from a mix of middle - and working - class backgrounds and anti-globalization and environmental groups .

The Deflated have made contact with like - minded activists in the United States .
Marrant is familiar with the U.S. television advertising campaign that equated buying an SUV with financing Islamic terrorism .
But he finds it too gloomy .
He says the French public supports his group ’s approach .
People send e-mails asking to participate or suggesting tactics , such as a special tool the activists now use for lightning - fast deflations .
“ It ’s a kind of key that deflates a tire very fast and completely , in two seconds , ” he said .
“ A mechanic sent an e-mail telling us about it .
He said , ‘ You can do better than you have been doing . ’ ”
Delabre , meanwhile , fears an eventual confrontation .

“ I put myself in the place of an owner of a four - wheel - drive who sees people messing up his vehicle , ” he said .
“ I worry that things will get out of control .
We ca n’t accept that in our fine democracy .
People have died for the freedom we have today . ”
