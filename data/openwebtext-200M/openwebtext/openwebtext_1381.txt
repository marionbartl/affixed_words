This post has a problem , I do n’t believe it ’s an error on my part but nothing is ruled out yet .
I ’ve mentioned the problem in the comments but the graphs hook down too much at the end and it does n’t seem related to short stations or steps in the data as I had surmised below .
Despite several hours of looking I have n’t isolated the cause although when using all series rather than the longest ones , I get much better CRU - ish plots from the data .
There will be an update for it this afternoon , but I need to run several more 20 minute runs to check out a hunch .

Today I ’ve worked on the GHCN global datasets .
This is a work in progress but I ’ve wanted to do this for some time .
The work in general of looking at global temperature was brought about because of the fact that Dr. Phil Jones has alleged he made a good dataset , after climategate I would n’t trust Jones to hold onto a dollar bill in a candy store .
What I ’ve learned over the week regarding the surface temperature data is amazing .
After referring to Mann08 data as a box of old socks , the surface stations are just as bad .
Instead of going forward as I naively hoped , I ’m going to have to back up and do more QC to get anything useful from the data and even then it will be difficult to be comfortable with it .
You really have to take a moment and think about what that last sentence means for climatology .
This project is just beginning but rather than report nothing , we should look at a bit of what I ’ve found .
In a previous post I averaged all the GHCN data to get the curve in Figure 1 .
This is a very different curve from what CRU presents normally as reproduced in the Figure 2 plot .
Figure 1 is n’t from gridded data so the spatial distribution of temperature stations can affect trends quite a bit .
Therefore it was important to first grid the data before averaging the grids into a global mean .
To create a gridded average , I plotted every single dataseries as it was added in , this led to the realization that there are a LOT of stations with steps in the anomaly curves .
Steps themselves being the true anomalies in the sensor readings .
These are probably caused by moving stations , adding blacktop next to the sensors , adding air conditioning uints , buildings , concrete , switching instruments , instrument failure , etc .
So much of this data is complete junk , it ’s hard to describe .
But I plowed on anyway .
Figure 3 is a plot of the grid weighted average of all the station ID ’s used in Figure 1 .
The data is collected into 5×5 degree area grids and then averaged for each gridcell , after that the globe is averaged together to create the trend .
The grid ’s are weighted by the cosine of their latitude before averaging so that the corrected area for each block is used .
This means that the one thermometer which may or may not exist in Muslim Somalia , is weighted according to it ’s grid area rather than against the hundreds of thermometers that probably exist in the grid block containing New York .
There is one difference between Figure 1 and Figure 3 besides the above , I ’ve modified the getstation ( ) function to grab the longest existing station data for each station ID .
Remember , in the GHCN data , each thermometer station can have several different sets of data .
The data come sometimes from the same thermometer and sometimes from a different one even though they have identical ID numbers .
This means that quite a few series , many of which were identical copies of the same data ( we do n’t know ) , have been discarded in favor of the longest series .
Figure 3 looks a lot more like Figure 1 than the CRU version in Figure 2 .
I ’m not claiming it ’s better , there are an awful lot of short term features missing from the curve , but it is apparently what the what raw GHCN data shows .
The station metadata comes with a flag for each station describing the size of town it ’s near .
The classifications are U – Urban , R – Rural , or S – Small town .
Rural means not associated with a town of 10,000 or greater population , S is 10,000 - 50,000 and U is everything bigger .
It gives an opportunity to do a couple of different plots based on population .
Anthony at WUWT would warn us that just because it says Rural , does n’t mean nobody put a road , runway or AC unit right by the thermometer , but it ’s worth a check .
As I wrote above , a lot of the data has large and obviously erroneous steps in it .
One QC step which can be handled automatically by an unpaid engineer ’s laptop would be to remove data with steps in it .
R offers a couple of functions for the detection of steps , unfortunately they run so slowly you would n’t see this post for the next two weeks .
Therefore , I wrote a crude step detector which removes gaps from time series .
It works by fitting a line to a window of the data to check the slope .
The window is shifted and another line is fit .
If the slope 0f any window exceeds a threshold amount , the series has a step in it , therefore it is not used .
A large number of bad series were thrown out using this method and a couple of good ones too .
Of course the point of all this is to see how much affect the steps are having on the result .
Figure 6 matches Figure 3 pretty well .
The signal is reasonably consistent even when large chunks of step data are thrown out .
Again , this does not match CRU very well and I wonder how they chose their station subset .
One of the themes at Climate Audit has always been questioning tht rules used to choose one dataset over another .
In this case , it seems to make a big difference in the result and the subset chosen by CRU does n’t match the bulk trend I find in the global surface data well .
Do n’t forget that this data is land only , and a truly global network needs to be averaged with sea temps to produce a complete global trend .
There is more to the story in this data , including the lack of availability of stations in recent years which may affect the trend in ALL of the graphs above more than we expect .
A bad situation considering the money we ’re being asked to spend on climate .

Reader and CRU comparison 2.R
In September 2006 , the Royal Society was apparently concerned about ExxonMobil 's involvement in funding political lobby groups .
This is what they said at that time .
The Society welcomes open debate , underpinned by sound science , on the subject of climate change .
This is an admirable position for the Royal Society to take .
A national academy should demand open debate on scientific issues and must require the science that informs that debate to be sound .
This is important , because we have seen in the CRU emails that prominent climate scientists , among them one of the Society 's own advisers , have attempted to prevent free debate on the subject of climate change .
On an issue of such importance it is inconceivable that the Royal Society would not take an unequivocal stand .
In that same statement , the society also said this :
In September 2006 , the Royal Society wrote to ExxonMobil to express concern that some of its corporate publications were presenting a misleading view of the scientific evidence about climate change and were over - emphasising uncertainties about what we do and do n't know ....
As the UK 's national academy of science , the Royal Society has a responsibility to speak out when scientific evidence is misrepresented .
We will continue to do this on climate change and on other issues .
It is essential that the scientific evidence on climate change is accurately represented so that policymakers , industry , the public and other stakeholders can make informed decisions about what actions to take .
I think all sides can agree that misrepresentation of the science to policymakers must be prevented .
Informed decision - making by politicians is vital .
Again , the need for a statement from the Royal Society is overwhelming .
It is clear at least from " Mike 's Nature trick " that scientific evidence has been misrepresented .
( The argument that the word " trick " means " technique " when used in the context of " hiding the decline " is foolish in the extreme .
The ready acceptance of this wordplay by journalists has brought them nothing but ridicule . )
Removing evidence that tree ring proxies are failing to capture temperature changes is simple misrepresentation .
This is an important moment for the Royal Society .
The evidence is clear - scientists at the CRU have misrepresented our understanding of the Earth 's temperature history to policymakers .
The Society must speak out now .
If it does not , then the fellows must take a stand against the Society 's leadership .
Failing that the premier scientific body of the UK will forever be brushed aside as another mouthpiece for the environmental movement .
" Amen " - Verweigerung Sekte lässt Kind verhungern
In den USA hat eine Sekte ein Kleinkind verhungern lassen , weil es sich vor dem Essen und nach dem Tischgebet weigerte , " Amen " zu sagen .
Als der Einjährige tot war , beteten die Anhänger für die Auferstehung des Jungen .
Last week , the Senate allowed Scientology to respond in Hansard to allegations made against them .
As usual , the cult used it as an opportunity to attack its former members .
Last week , the Senate Privileges Committee permitted the Church of Scientology to respond in Hansard to issues raised by Senator Nick Xenophon in November last year .
The Scientologists promptly issued a press release declaring they had responded to Xenophon “ in Parliament ” , as if they had some sort of elected status .
In allowing the Scientologist response into Hansard , the Privileges Committee has allowed itself to be made party to an attack on individuals who were brave enough to raise their treatment at the hands of Scientology .
It takes guts for ex-Scientologists to come out and reveal what they have suffered , particularly those — and this is a recurring theme among ex-Scientologists — who admit that they themselves harmed other members while within the cult .
The mere act of leaving the cult earns them ostracism and often the severance of contact with loved ones .
To reveal their suffering at the hands of the cult frequently leads to public attacks .
Such attacks occupy much of the cult ’s response to Xenophon , which the committee , without giving reasons , decided merited entry into Hansard .
“ The bulk of the Senator ’s presentation relied on letters containing unsubstantiated allegations made by a few disgruntled apostates , ” the Scientologists claim .
The apostasy line is key , because the Scientologists want to argue that any ex-members who reveal their treatment are simply “ shifting responsibility ” .
To back it up , they quote a special Scientology - commissioned essay by late US cult - expert Lonnie D. Kliever , which suggests “ even the accounts of voluntary defectors with no grudges to bear must be used with caution ” .
The line is , basically : no criticism of Scientology by ex-members can ever be accepted as valid because these are people blaming the cult for their own problems .

Not satisfied with that , the Scientologists then effectively call their critics liars , noting that they have previously been on the public record as being positive about their experience with the cult .
“ Such positive statements are consistent with the experiences of millions of other parishioners of Scientology .
That these people now hold a different view is entirely their own personal affair . ”
One of the fascinating aspects of the remarkable investigation of the cult by Florida ’s St Petersburg Times last year , which chronicles among other things widespread physical abuse , including by Scientologist leader David Miscavige , is the admission by former high - level Scientology executives such as Marty Rathbun and Mike Rinder that they readily lied to the press and in sworn affidavits to cover up embarrassing or even criminal activity occurring within Scientology ranks .
Rinder was the Scientology spokesman at whom BBC reporter John Sweeney famously lost it in 2007 .
He now says he engaged in a systematic practice of denial to protect the cult : “ just deny it .
Nope .
Not true .
Never happened . ”
The cult directly accuses its victims of lying in its statement to the Senate Privileges Committee , smearing them in the process :
The allegations of Aaron Saxton and Carmel Underwood regarding forced abortions are untrue .
The Church of Scientology does not counsel expectant mothers to have abortions and has never forced anyone to obtain one .
Sworn statements have been obtained from numerous female Church staff members who served during the same time as Carmel Underwood , all of whom became pregnant while on staff , some as many as three times , and all of whom state that they were never encouraged , pressured or even suggested to have an abortion .
They all state that they were well cared for and given time off as needed to care for their children , as was Carmel Underwood .
So let ’s pull together the evidence about forced abortions in Scientology , which , remember , was just one of several serious issues raised by Senator Xenophon .
The requirement for pregnant women at the elite “ Sea Org ” level within Scientology to have abortions , has long been rumoured , but former members have repeatedly confirmed it through sworn evidence .
Mary Tabayoyon , a former staffer to no less than L. Ron Hubbard , swore in 1994 that :
Beginning in 1986 , members of the Sea Org were forbidden to have any more children if they were to stay on post and the Hubbard technology was applied to coercively persuade us to have abortions so that we could remain on post .
In 1998 , Jesse Prince swore an affidavit that :
In late 1991 , my wife Monika became pregnant and although we were elated , she was ordered to abort the child .
The reason for the abortion order is that Sea Org members were not allowed to have children .
The order devastated both my wife and me .
Our dedication as Sea Org members clashed violently with our intentions as parents and we went through a personal nightmare with me opposing it , to no avail .
She got the abortion and afterwards she was not the same .
In Laura DeCrescenzo ’s suit against the cult in 2009 , she stated in her statement of claim that she had been forced to have an abortion at the age of 17 .
DeCrescenzo was one of six former Scientologists who spoke of the suffering they had endured within Scientology at a press conference in Los Angeles last Friday .
The group ’s claims were as always dismissed as fabricated by Scientology .
Clarie Headley similarly filed a statement that she was ordered to have two abortions , one in 1994 and the other in 1996 , the latter at her own expense , under threat of being ejected from Scientology .
Rathbun has spoken of how abortion had become an “ institutional prerequisite ” under Miscavige .
Two former female “ Sea Orgs ” , including Miscavige ’s niece , told American ABC News of the abortion policy .
One , Astra Woodcraft , made a sworn statement that :
… a staff member from the Religious Technology Center ( the Sea Org ’s highest organisation ) came up to me one day while I was in the process of routing out and asked me what I was doing .
I told him that I was pregnant and leaving and he said to me “ Oh , too late for an abortion ? ” I personally knew of three other girls who got pregnant and were convinced to get abortions .
One was my sister - in - law who was 16 weeks pregnant when she was convinced to abort her child although she was strongly against it .
A former Scientology staff member ( i.e. below the rank of Sea Org ) Terra Hattaway told a Georgia court that she was subject to continual efforts to persuade her to have an abortion .
These are just some of numerous cases of former Scientologists reporting themselves manipulated , coerced or persuaded to have abortions .
So far no evidence has emerged that the abortion requirement is imposed on ordinary Scientologist “ parishioners ” .
To use the Scientologists ’ phrase in their statement to the Privileges Committee , “ all of these matters are the subject of documented evidence and sworn witness statements . ”
There is clear evidence that there was a policy among US Scientology of coerced abortion among high - level “ Sea Org ” members , and in at least one case , at Scientology staff level , below that of Sea Org .
This material would all have been available to the Privileges Committee had it bothered to conduct some basic research .
Instead , people prepared to speak out against Scientology have been attacked in Hansard .
The Privileges Committee , headed by Liberal George Brandis and Labor ’s Jacinta Collins , should explain to the Senate why it was party to what , on the face of it , appears to be a misleading of the Senate .
The committee is n’t the only body that has been derelict in its basic research into Scientology .
The Prime Minister responded to Senator Xenophon ’s material in November by saying this :
Many people in Australia have real concerns about Scientology .
I share some of those concerns .
But let us proceed carefully , and look carefully at the material which he has provided , before we make a decision on further Parliamentary action .
And we intend to provide appropriate examination of the material which he has put forward .
That was on November 18 .
I asked the Prime Minister ’s office two days ago what follow - up there had been to this statement .
The PMO said that the matter had been referred to Chris Evans , the leader of the Government in the Senate .
Despite the two days ’ notice , Evans ’ office had not responded by deadline .
In December , Evans ’ office told correspondents that the Government did not support an inquiry into the issues raised by Senator Xenophon as it was “ inappropriate to conduct an inquiry into a private and , in this case , religious organisation ” .
Taxpayers continue to subsidise the Church of Scientology to the tune of at least tens of millions of dollars a year , courtesy of its tax - free status as a religion in Australia .
You probably use idioms in your language every day without thinking – but the meanings of those idioms can be mystifying for new speakers .
Idioms are fixed expressions with meanings that are n’t easily derived from their surface elements , so translating them word - for - word or without human translators can lead to puzzling results .
Although many of their meanings are shared across cultures , idioms vary from language to language in fascinating ways that can speak volumes .
Do any of these idioms sound familiar ?
Chinese
1 . De yu wang quan .
( “ Forget the trap as soon as the fish is caught . ” )
This Chinese expression might sound similar to one of the idioms in the English language .
The direct Chinese translation suggests that the end result is all that matters , just like in “ the ends justify the means . ”
2 . An xia hu lu fu qi piao .
( “ Just as one gourd has been pushed under water , another bobs up . ” )
Even though idioms in another language may sound unusual , they often have a familiar meaning .
This phrase reminds us how solving one problem often creates one more .
In other words , if it ’s not one thing , it ’s another .
Dutch
3 . Wachten tot je een ons weegt .
( “ Wait until you weigh an ounce . ” )
This may seem strange , but there ’s a similar expression in English .
When you ’re waiting for something that will never happen , you might as well say “ when pigs fly . ”
4 . “ Een huishouden van Jan Steen ” ( “ A household by Jan Steen ” )
The famous Dutch artist Jan Steen ’s painting of a messy room serves as inspiration for this expression .
It ’s another version of the idioms in many languages that describe a total mess – a “ pigsty ” in English .
French
5 . Avoir d’autres chats à fouetter ( “ Have other cats to whip ” )
English speakers might be familiar with a similar violent idiom in their own language .
If you have other things to handle , you have “ other fish to fry . ”
6. Tomber de Charybde en Scylla ( “ Fall from Charybdis to Scylla ” )
This idiom from another language might be familiar to fans of Odysseus .
The French version of “ out of the frying pan and into the fire ” refers to the two mythical monsters that sailors had to pass to get to safety .
Unlucky travelers often avoided one , only to fall prey to another .
German
7 . Wie ein Murmeltier schlafen ( “ Sleep like a marmot . ” )
In similar idioms in the English language , “ sleep like a log ” and “ sleep like a dog ” indicate that you have had a good night ’s rest .
In German , referencing a marmot means you ’ve gotten your sleep .
8. Ich will Dir keinen Baeren aufbinden .
( “ I do n’t fasten a bear to you . ” )
Another of the idioms in the German language about furry creatures , this is another way of saying that I ’m not “ pulling your leg . ”
Spanish
9 . A toro pasado ( “ By the bull gone past ” )
There are idioms in every language about taking a new view of past events .
This Spanish idiom refers to seeing something “ in hindsight . ”
10 .
Andar como burro sin mecate ( “ Walk like a donkey without a leash ” )
A donkey with free rein must be pretty wild to have inspired these idioms .
In the Spanish language , this popular phrase describes someone who is out of control .

Profile : ' Chemical Ali ' Ali Hassan al - Majid , a former Iraqi official known as " Chemical Ali " , has been executed by hanging , a government spokesman has announced .
Majid , an enforcer in Saddam Hussein 's regime and his cousin , had earlier been sentenced to death four times for genocide and crimes against humanity .
Earlier this month , he was sentenced to death for ordering the gas attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 .
It is believed that about 5,000 people died in the attack .
Iraqi jets swooped over Halabja and for five hours sprayed it with a lethal cocktail of mustard gas and the nerve agents Tabun , Sarin and VX .
Brutality ANALYSIS Jim Muir , BBC Baghdad correspondent
For both the Kurds and the Shias , " Chemical " Ali Hassan al - Majid personified the evils of Saddam Hussein 's regime almost as much as Saddam himself .
His hanging could be seen as helping national reconciliation and the closing of an ugly chapter .
But Sunnis , who were empowered under Saddam and among whom many have felt disenfranchised since his overthrow , may see Majid 's demise as an act of revenge rather than one of justice .
End of a dark chapter Majid was " executed by hanging until death " , Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said in a statement " The execution happened without any violations , shouting or cries of joy , " he added , in sharp contrast to Saddam 's death on the gallows in 2006 .
Iraqi state television , al - Iraqiya , broadcast pictures of what it said was the execution of Majid , although the BBC has not yet confirmed the authenticity of the images .
News of the hanging came shortly after three suicide car bombs struck in central Baghdad .
It was not immediately clear whether the attacks were linked to his execution .
Majid was first sentenced to hang in June 2007 for his role in a military campaign against ethnic Kurds , codenamed Anfal , that lasted from February to August of 1988 .
In December 2008 he also received a death sentence for his role in crushing a Shia revolt after the 1991 Gulf War.
FOUR DEATH SENTENCES Jan 2010 : For ordering gas attack on Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 in which 5,000 people died March 2009 :
For the 1999 killings of Shia Muslims in the Sadr City district of Baghdad Dec 2008 : For his role in crushing a Shia revolt after 1991 Gulf War June 2007 :
For role in six - month military campaign against ethnic Kurds , codenamed Anfal , in 1988 In March 2009 he was sentenced to death , along with others , for the 1999 killings of Shia Muslims in the Sadr City district of Baghdad .
The BBC's Jim Muir in Baghdad says Majid could have been hanged earlier - after his first death sentence for the Anfal campaign .
But it was important to Iraqi Kurds to see him convicted of the Halabja attack , seen as one of the worst atrocities of Saddam Hussein 's regime .
No remorse
Our correspondent says there will be great rejoicing or , at the very least , quiet relief among both Iraq 's Shia and Kurdish communities , which have suffered greatly at his hands .
Iraqi state TV broadcast pictures of what it said was Majid 's execution
There was a mixed reaction from ordinary Iraqis to news of the execution .
" I give my condolences to the Iraqi people on the death of Ali Hassan al - Majid , who was killed by traitors and hooligans , " said a resident of Majid 's home town , Tikrit .
But Baghdad resident Ali Suhail said the execution was just : '' He had executed so many people .
So he deserves to be executed . "
A resident of Halabja also said he was pleased : '' We , the families of those killed in the attack on Halabja , are very pleased to hear that Ali Hassan al - Majid was executed .
" Once again we call upon the Iraqi people and government to be united and serve the Iraqi people and families of those killed in poison gas attack . "
FROM THE PM PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from PM Majid - the King of Spades in the US military 's pack of cards of most - wanted Iraqis - was arrested in August 2003 .
He has refused to express remorse at any of his trials , insisting that he was acting in the interests of Iraqi security .
The Iraqi High Tribunal was set up to try former members of Saddam Hussein 's mainly Sunni government and was the same one that sentenced the former president to death .
Footage of Saddam 's execution in December 2006 was posted on the internet .
It showed the dictator being confronted by opponents who jeered and clapped as he was being hanged .

Insulin injections are currently the mainstay of type 1 diabetes treatment Scientists in Cambridge have shown that an " artificial pancreas " can be used to regulate blood sugar in children with Type 1 diabetes .
A trial found that combining a " real time " sensor measuring glucose levels with a pump that delivers insulin can boost overnight blood sugar control .
The Lancet study showed the device significantly cut the risk of blood sugar levels dropping dangerously low .
Experts said the results were an important " step forward " .
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic , life threatening condition , in which the pancreas does not produce insulin - the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels .
We need to redouble our efforts to move the artificial pancreas from a concept in the clinic to a reality in the home of children and adults with Type 1 diabetes
Karen Addington , Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ' Pump has been really liberating '
In total , 17 children and teenagers with Type 1 diabetes took part in the study over 54 nights in hospital .
Individually , the glucose monitoring system and the insulin pump used in the study are both already widely used and commercially available .
But in order to turn them into a " closed loop " system which monitors the patient 's condition and delivers treatment accordingly , the researchers developed a sophisticated algorithm to calculate the appropriate amount of insulin to deliver based on the real - time glucose readings .
They then measured how well the artificial pancreas system controlled glucose levels compared with the children 's regular continuous pump , which delivers insulin at preselected rates .
Low blood sugar Testing was done in different circumstances - for example on nights when the children went to bed after eating a large evening meal , which can lead to ' insulin stacking ' or having done early evening exercise - both of which can increase the risk of low blood sugar episodes known as hypoglycaemic attacks or " hypos " .
1 - Continuous glucose sensor monitors blood sugar level 2 - Data transmitted for the computer program to work out insulin dose 3 - Insulin pump delivers the dose Overall , the results showed the artificial pancreas kept blood glucose levels in the normal range for 60 % of the time , compared with 40 % for the continuous pump .
And the artificial pancreas halved the time that blood glucose levels fell below 3.9 mmol / l - the level considered as mild hypoglycaemia .
It also prevented blood glucose falling below 3.0 mmol / l , which is defined as significant hypoglycaemia , compared with nine hypoglycaemia events in the control groups .
Study leader Dr Roman Hovorka said : " This is the first randomised study showing the potential benefit of the artificial pancreas system overnight using commercially - available sensors and pumps .
" Our study provides a stepping stone for testing the system at home . "
Karen Addington , chief executive of Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation , who funded the research said the study provided " proof of principle " of an artificial pancreas .
" We need to redouble our efforts to move the artificial pancreas from a concept in the clinic to a reality in the home of children and adults with type 1 diabetes . "
Dr Victoria King , research manager at leading health charity Diabetes UK , said : " This is an important step forward in managing overnight blood glucose levels as well as in the eventual development of a full ' artificial pancreas ' which could vastly improve the quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes and reduce the risk of the associated complications .

Here 's the deal .
When the Wild are n't playing , and there is no vast conspiracy running through its lifespan in the blogs and chat rooms around the interwebz , I get bored .
When I get bored , I crawl out of my safety zone and venture out into the world of blogs I do n't normally read .
That 's when I get myself in trouble .
Make the jump if you want to have some fun today .
Let me preface this post with this .
Kukla 's Korner is a great place to go for access to information for all 30 teams .
It is a set up much like SBN was , with a blog for nearly every team in the league .
The difference between the two ( KK and SBN ) is that SBN seems to have cherry picked some of the best blogs from across the web and put them all in one place .
What this leads to is a powerhouse network of blogs , all with mostly professional posts with the occasional light hearted homer - esque post from time to time .
Kukla 's Korner has its fair share of truly professional blogs , including everything from Paul Kukla himself .
Then , there is the Red Wings blog , From Abel to Yzerman .
I do n't often read Red Wings blogs because they tend to , as Puck Daddy 's Greg Wyshynski would say , be part of the tinfoil hat wearing crowd .
Despite the fact that the Wings are a perennial powerhouse team , constantly in contention for the Cup and every other award there is , the fans and bloggers still seem to think the entire NHL fanbase and the NHL itself is out to get them somehow .
The main poster at From Abel to Yzerman , IwoCPO , is truly the most homerific of all homerific bloggers I have ever read .
Is there anything wrong with that ?
Nah , as long as the reader understands that and takes every word written there with that information in hand .
I stopped reading A2Y awhile back .
I just could not handle the conspiracies , the ignorance of where and who the Red Wings are in relation to the rest of the league , and the constant whining about how the Wings got jobbed yet again .
Your team got jobbed by a ref ?
Welcome to the NHL .
There 's jackets and everything .
Anyway .
Today I was told by a friend to go read the two latest posts over at A2Y .
I swallowed the inevitable vomit creeping into my mouth and headed over to see what could possibly have led for this request .
Once I read them , I decided I needed to voice a couple concerns with the posts , so here we go .
From the first post , titled Instead Of Whining ?
Let 's Make Some Sort Of Sick Contest Out Of It .
First off , the title ?
Just , wow .
What is the question mark for ?
I am not a grammatical master , hell there are probably enough spelling and grammar errors in this post to give any responder plenty of ammo against me .
However , not every word in a title is capitalized .
Only the important ones .
Back to the post .
If we were Pens fans , we ’d be piling up the alibis , pointing to different injuries as to reasons why our guys can’t possibly be expected to win with any frequency .
But , thank Jebus , Santa and the patron saint of serial killers , we ’re not fans of a one - trick team whose " captain " requests permission from his owner to wear powdered blue around the house .
Fair enough , I guess .
A Red Wings blogger criticizing Penguins fans .
Creative .
But to call them a " one trick team " is something I do n't understand , and is not specified in the post .
Is IwoCPO suggesting they have just one player who is good enough to win a game ?
Because that is not the case .
Is it in reference to how many Cups they have won ?
Nope , ca n't be that either .
So ... what is it ?
Please explain .
I also love that captain is in quotes , as if to suggest that Crosby is not a very good captain .
Well done with the play on punctuation , there .
Again , very creative .
Despite the fact that if the Wings could get Crosby , IwoCPO would give his ( her ? ) right arm to make it happen .
Moving on to the second post , titled Memo To Everyone Else : You Do n't Want This Team In Your Lives .
My cherry picked quote from this post is :
Will they win the Cup each season ?
No .
Injuries , officials and a league run by a commissioner with his tongue stuck to a stop sign are just too formidable of a combination to overcome every year .
But , hold on now .
In this post you say that injuries are going to hold your team back from winning a Cup every year , but in the post right after it ( the one referenced above ) , you claim that you will not whine about injuries nor use them as excuses , sorry , alibis .
I do enjoy the hedging of the bet in this post , though .
That if the Wings do n't win the Cup every year , it must be due to some confluence of events that prevented it from happening .
It must either be that too many players were hurt ( but they would not suggest that ) , the officials ( get your tinfoil hats ready ) , or the Commissioner .
It could not possibly be that another team was , you know , better than the Wings that year .
Noooo ....
So , here we are .
Nearing the end of my post .
I am almost certain that anyone who made it this far is wondering what this has to do with the Minnesota Wild .
To that I answer , absolutely nothing .
Except for this .
" Writers " like IwoCPO ( see what I did there , with the quotes ? ) are the example NHL teams point to when they refuse to credential bloggers .
Bloggers such as him ( her ? ) serve as the antithesis of what most bloggers are , which is fans who have some semblance of objectivity .
It is also " writers " like these that lead to hatred of the Red Wings and their fan base .
Whether it 's fair or not to lump all Detroit fans in with IwoCPO , he ( she ? ) is one of the more vocal folks , and attitudes or viewpoints like his are n't exactly conducive to planting seeds of goodwill .
Not that he ( she ? ) and every other Red Wings fan really care what other fan bases think of them , but they sure seem to complain a lot about it .
Do n't they ?
Thank you IwoCPO , and From Abel to Yzerman for ensuring that NHL teams always have plenty of ammunition to use when denying credentials to bloggers who actually have some professionalism .
We appreciate it .

A job - related accident or illness can leave you disabled and unable to financially support your family and yourself .
Massachusetts , however , provides a way for injured workers to receive certain benefits if they are hurt in the course of their employment .
Under the state Workers ’ Compensation
Act , all employers in the state must carry this no -fault insurance coverage .
It provides medical , wage , job retraining , and other benefits to employees who were harmed or became sick as a result of their work .
Our Boston workers ’ compensation attorneys have the experience necessary to help you pursue your benefits and help you appeal any claim denial .
To qualify for workers ’ compensation benefits , your injury or illness must be job - related and cause you to miss at least five days of work .
Your employer ’s insurer will review your claim to determine your eligibility .
If you qualify , you will receive compensation for reasonable and necessary medical costs associated with your injuries , partial wage compensation , and possibly other benefits .
The amount of financial assistance you receive , and the duration , will depend on how much your accident or illness disabled you .
The main categories are :
Partial disability –
You can receive 60 percent of your average weekly wage , but no more than 75 percent of what you would receive if you had a temporary total disability , for up to five years .
Temporary total disability – Your benefits would be 60 percent of your average weekly wage for up to three years .
Permanent total disability –
You would receive two - thirds of your average weekly wage for as long as your disability lasts .
Your employer ’s insurer may try to deny your claim for a number of reasons .
For instance , it may dispute your eligibility , the extent of your injury or illness , or your need for certain medical care .
It may also approve your claim and then later ask the Department of Industrial Accidents ( DIA ) to reduce your benefits .
If the insurer denies or wants to modify your benefits , you can dispute the decision by appealing to the DIA .
The dispute process involves various stages , including a meeting with a DIA conciliator and hearings before an administrative judge .
You will need to present medical evidence to support your position .
Our Boston workers ’ compensation lawyers have handled numerous claims .

Well before I begin , here ’s a little window into what htaccess ( hypertext access ) is all about .
An htaccess file is a simple ASCII file , such as you would create through a text editor like NotePad .
Many people seem to have some confusion over the naming convention for the file , so let me get that out of the way .
‘.htacess ’ is simply a file extension with no file name at all .
[ dot ] by default makes the files hidden on almost every web servers and operating systems .
In simple words , they are simple text files where you can put server directives similar to “ httpd.conf ” or a “ php.ini ” file .
But the real difference is unlike these master directive files , htaccess powers you to apply directives to the directories in which htaccess resides and the subdirectories within .
Now let us come to the point for which you are here – the groovy things :
1. Password Protection
Adding password protection to your directories is a simple 2 step process .
i . Add appropriate directives to the htaccess file in the directory you wish to protect .
Every subdirectory and file will be protected within .
AuthName " Section Name " // it ’s the directory name you wish to protect AuthType Basic AuthUserFile / full / path / to/.htpasswd // absolute path of the .htpasswd file Require valid-user
ii .
Create a .htpasswd file that contains usernames and passwords .
The username password pairs must be added in the format “ username : password ” , where password is encrypted format of the password .
You can encrypt the password using one of the premade scripts available on the web or write your own .
There is a good username / password service at the KxS site http://www.kxs.net/support/htaccess_pw.html
which will allow you to enter the user name and password and will output it in the correct format .
.
2. Save Bandwidth with .htaccess
You can save some bucks by putting in the code below into your htaccess file .
It enables the PHP ’s built - in zlib compression module .
It will squeeze your bandwidth usage approximately to half or even more .
Note : if you run phpsuexec , you ’ll need to put php directives in a local “ php.ini ” file and not in htaccess .
< ifModule mod_php4.c > php_value zlib.output_compression 16386 </ifModule >
.
3. Deny or Allow users from a particular network / IP Address :
Is there a pesky person bugging you ?
Stalking your site , htaccess powers you to block him / her .
You can deny access based upon IP address or an IP block .
The above blocks access to the site from xxx.xxx .xxx.xxx , and from any sub-domain under the IP block xxx.xxx.xxx .
* order allow , deny deny from xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx // to deny from particular IP Address deny from xxx.xxx.xxx . // to deny from set of IP Addresses allow from all * deny from all // to deny requests from all ip addresses
.
4. Custom Error Pages
htaccess allows you to have your own , personal error pages to show up when the server responds with an error code .
And henceforth , give your site a more professional outlook in unlikely event of error .
By doing this you give yourself a good chance to retain your almost - lost visitor .
This is how you can do this .
Al you need to know is the error number .
ErrorDocument errornumber / file.html
e.g .
ErrorDocument 401/ errors/401.php ErrorDocument 403/errors /403.php ErrorDocument 404/ errors /404.php ErrorDocument 500/ errors /500.
php
.
5. STOP Directory index from listing
Many times you might have faced the situation that you do not have index file in your directory .
In such case all the files just get listed in the browser that can lead to security risks .
With htaccess you can plug this .
All you have to do is type in Options - Indexes into your htaccess file and no more directory listings .
.
That ’s it !
Cheers !!
Young leopard gets a prickly reception as it tries to eat a porcupine
This young male leopard gets a prickly reception after deciding to make a meal of a porcupine .
The big cat was left with sore paws and a bruised ego after losing out in a battle of wits with its spiny opponent .
Using all his hunting techniques , the two - year - old male tried pouncing on the porcupine from above , prodding him and trying to roll him over , but to no avail .
Spiky reception :
The two - year - old male leopard decides to make a meal of the wandering porcupine , but gets several painful spines in his paws for his trouble
Undeterred , the hungry feline even tried extending a gentle paw as the porcupine shook its foot - long spines ferociously .
After 25 minutes and several painful spines in his paws , the big cat was forced to accept defeat and retreat with his tail between his legs .
The incredible moment was captured on camera by professional wildlife photographer Shem Compion in the Mashatu Game reserve , in Botswana .
Prickly customer :
The leopard spent 25 minutes and exhausted his whole hunting repertoire including leaping on top of the porcupine before slinking off in defeat
Painful :
The leopard got several of the porcupine 's quills stuck in it as he struggled to get past its defences
Mr Compion , 33 , who lives in South Africa , said : ' Excitement hardly describes my feelings - it was one of my top wildlife sightings ever .
' We saw this beautiful leopard lounging on a log and then a few moments later a porcupine walked nearby and started nibbling some roots .
' Suddenly , this relaxed leopard spotted the porcupine and sprang on to high alert , watching the rodent before getting up to stalk him .
' From then on it was full adrenaline .
The leopard spent 25 minutes trying to touch the porcupine and get to him .
' The porcupine kept pushing his quills towards the cat and rattling them in a very frightening manner - the leopard would jump in shock .
Me-owww :
The young leopard pulls its paw back in pain after one of the foot - long quills lodges in it
' He tried all sorts of things to get under the porcupine but nothing was working and eventually he gave up and lay down .
' There 's a rule in the bush which says " only food runs " , so the porcupine knew to stick around until the leopard had walked away so it could get water from a pool .
' It went from tension to suspense , pain , torment and eventually relief .
It was a truly incredible sight . '
So there 's no question that the iPad has generated plenty of interest and debate , but the big question remaining is how that will translate into actual sales .
According to a new RBC / ChangeWave survey , however , it seems that the iPad is at least on track to do slightly better than the iPhone did , at least initially ... maybe .
To be a bit more specific , the survey found that of the 3,200 respondents , 13 % were either somewhat likely or very likely to buy an iPad , compared to 9 % who said the same thing about the iPhone way back in April , 2007 .
Of course , that says little about the potential long - term success of the iPad , and there 's also the small issue of the iPhone already existing , which no doubt factors considerably into anyone 's potential iPad purchase .
Not surprisingly , RBC also says that the iPad relatively low price is a significant factor , and adds that only 8 % of respondents were unwilling to pay Apple 's prices for the iPad , compared to hefty 28 % that said the initial iPhone prices were out of the question for them .
Today is Public Domain Day , in honor of which I ’m hereby relicensing ( or more properly , unlicensing ) all of my software into the public domain .
As the public domain is these days unfortunately somewhat an obscure concept to many people , and disclaiming copyright interest in open - source software seems at present a relatively rare phenomenon ( though there exist some notable examples ) , I will elaborate some on the rationale and implications .
As is often the case , there are two kinds of reasons for doing this : the practical and the moral .
Let ’s start with some practical reasons .
If you are an open - source developer like me , licensing is likely a growing headache for you .
Yes , it ’s all “ open source ” , but which flavor ?
Let me ask you : how often have you passed up on utilizing a great software library just because its open source license was not compatible with your own preferred flavor ?
How many precious hours of your life have you spent deliberating how to license your software or worrying about licensing compatibility with other software ?
How many wheels have you rewritten because of licensing concerns ?
As you know , there are basically three camps in the FLOSS movement : viral copyleft licensing ( so - called “ Free Software ” ) , permissive licensing ( “ open source ” ) , and the public domain .
It ’s fairly evident that this last camp has been somewhat underrepresented in the last decade and more ( and there are reasons for that ) , with most of the action having taken place in the former two camps .
But that could change in an eyeblink .
Now , if you are like me , you ’ve never cared much for the concept of copyleft to begin with , and have tended to by default prefer more permissive and liberal licenses such as MIT , BSD , ISC or the Apache License .
That already puts you very near the public domain in practical terms .
Basically , the key difference between these permissive licenses and the public domain is that in the latter you stop holding a gun to your users ’ heads regarding attribution .
More on this later .
So , if you ’ve preferred permissive licenses , you probably have often uttered a silent sigh when you ’ve come across a nice new piece of GPL / LGPL software whose author has inadvertently doomed it to relative obscurity with his licensing choice .
For while you might have extended the software and contributed to the project , your interest level dropped as soon as you saw the licensing terms .
It turned out to be the equivalent of contaminated code , and assuming that you are not the only one to feel that way , an unintended consequence of the author ’s licensing choice has been to curtail the pool of early adopters and contributors .
Having had that experience often enough , I ’ve so far made sure to stick with the MIT license for all my software ( excepting special cases with external constraints , such as with my Drupal modules ) .
The nice thing about the MIT license and its peers are that they do n’t impede cross-pollination : MIT - licensed code can be directly used without legal problems in other software licensed under an equally - permissive license ( e.g. the revised BSD license ) , and vice versa , because these licenses do n’t attempt to prohibit relicensing .
Contrast this with the GPL / LGPL , which are one - way streets , or put another way , they are an entry without an exit .
To paraphrase a classic song , your code can be checked out anytime you like , but it can never leave .
It ’s easy to see that if you want your code to be used as widely as possible , copyleft is perhaps not the way to go .
But then , that ’s sort of the whole point of copyleft , of course : you can look at my code , but if you touch it in a way I do n’t approve of , I ’ll crucify you with law and impunity .
This leads us into some of the moral , and immoral , aspects of claiming a state - created and state - enforced distribution monopoly on a piece of software .
If you failed Ethics 101 ( sociopaths , raise your hand ) or are not one to philosophize , you can safely quit reading here .
What copyrighting your code really comes down to is this : when you include a license statement in your software project , you are effectively making a threat to the users of your software .
You are saying that if they do n’t behave according to whatever arbitrary criteria you ’ve set out in your license statement , you will send some men with guns after them .
I do n’t know about you , but I think that ’s a pretty shitty thing to do .
Applying the coercive machinery of the state in this way always boils down to the threat of physical violence for non-compliance .
When applied , it usually fiddles out into merely financial catastrophe because the victim ( that ’d be the so - called “ infringer ” , by the way ) does n’t put up a fight and does show up in the courtroom to hear the verdict that he is bankrupt .
The threat of violence is always in the background , though , and what you ’ve done , if you should ever actually press suit for copyright infringement , is given men with guns a pretext for tearing apart a life , or lives , in case your victim does n’t decide to play ball .
( The inconvenient fact that you actually do n’t possess any right to delegate the initiation of force in this way is a longer topic best suited for a political philosophy class . )
Now , I do n’t know about you , but the least effective way to secure my cooperation is to threaten me .
That virtually guarantees that I ’ll do the opposite of what you want ( even at personal cost to myself ) , or at the very least that I will choose not to associate with you in the future .
When I say that copyleft code is contaminated , I very much mean that .
It is code with significant legal strings attached , and when using it you had better be very aware of those strings .
Again , of course , that ’s the point of the FSF ’s strategy , so in case you agree with their missive you will see this as a benefit .
I personally do n’t , because I have no interest whatsoever in wreaking havoc on people who want to use my code or ( heaven forbid ) profit from it .
I have better things to do .
It is a strange thing , indeed , to think , as copyleft advocates do , that it ’s worth outrage and legal action if somebody incorporates some code of yours into their closed - source proprietary software .
In all but the most special of cases , your “ abusers ” have not actually harmed you in any way .
In fact , what they have done is paid you a compliment , whether they choose to openly acknowledge it or not .
Further , if the code they ’ve incorporated is substantial , they have an economic incentive to cooperate with you by contributing patches and enhancements instead of attempting to maintain their own private fork of your software .
Hell , they may even hire you .
Whether they do so or not , you have not lost anything , and you may have gained something .
This is known as a positive - sum outcome .
It is a stranger thing , even , to believe that slapping a licensing statement on your software will in some way prevent such wonderful “ abuse ” in the first place .
That is simply a form of magical thinking .
Those who would benefit from your software without reciprocity will do so in any case , with or without your implied copyright - sanctioned threats ; and regarding my software I say , they ’re welcome to knock themselves out .
It ’s no loss to me .
Not only copyleft advocates but anybody affixing a licensing statement to open - source software is guilty of either magical thinking or of having an intention to follow up on the implied threat .
The only thing your license will prevent , or at least curtail , is the adoption of your software .
Let us briefly consider a couple of contemporary examples of whether you can successfully attempt to legislate people ’s private behavior , or merely drive it underground with the force of guns .
When you smoked that joint last night on New Year ’s Eve , did you care about the fact that it is , supposedly , illegal ?
You knew perfectly well that there exists some bunch of legalese in some legal code you ’ve never seen that claims , if you can believe it , to give certain men with guns the “ legitimate ” authority to prevent you from ingesting certain natural compounds , and to physically restrain and do violence to you in pursuance of that end .
Of course , being the reasonable person that you presumably are , you knew all that to be a bunch of nonsense and saw right through that claim of legitimacy .
Those paragraphs of legal garbage no more bound you last night than do , well , the dead fingers of the dead lawyers who wrote them .
Thus , last night you only took the sensible precaution of avoiding those particular men with guns who irrationally worship those dead fingers , just as you exercised caution about walking home through a bad neighborhood and opted for a cab instead .
Smart of you .
To consider an example perhaps closer to home for those in my captive audience who are merely suffering from a vulgar hangover today : if you are anything like most twentysomethings or younger , you will be quite familiar with torrenting the latest television series , movies and music .
You know perfectly well that a bunch of lawyers and politicians claim that what you are doing is “ wrong ” and that they would dearly love to “ punish ” you for it every chance they get , and you do n’t believe a word they say .
In fact , pirating entertainment is now so mainstream that only 3 % of Canadians and ( closer to home , for me ) 1 % of Spaniards still believe that it is criminal behavior , so you ’re in good company .
Not that this will stop the copyright cops , always on the lookout for imaginary abuses of imaginary property , from “ confiscating evidence ” ( otherwise known as home invasion plus property theft ) and hauling your sorry behind to a courtroom ( otherwise known as abduction ) if they come knocking .
So be safe .
The practical point being that , if you are twentysomething or younger , you already know that copyright is dead .
It ’s a joke , really .
The genie is out of the bottle , and refuses to go back in , but all these middlemen are running around in a panic trying to forcibly stuff it back in .
Like the Prohibition or the so - called War on Drugs , it ’s one of those things where the writing is clearly on the wall , and it ’s just a matter of time .
The world got along fine before copyright , and will continue to do so ( all the better , in fact ) long after the concept has been given up for the farce that it is .
So , why not give it a kick in the behind to speed things along ?
The moral point being that if you ’re pirating copyrighted material or clicking through idiotic EULAs without reading them , why on earth are you still slapping a copyright notice on software you yourself write and release ?
Do you know what that makes you ?
It makes you a hypocrite .
Nobody wants to be a hypocrite .
I ’ve given up being a hypocrite ( about this , anyway ) today .
What about you ?
I ’ve collected some resources at Unlicense.org that will help you unlicense your code into the public domain .
Be good .
This article was first published in The American Conservative , March 1 , 2010 .
If the last few decades prove anything about America ’s strategy in fighting Islamic terrorism , it ’s that no matter what the other side throws our way , America will respond in the most counterintuitive and self - destructive manner imaginable .
The routine goes something like this : if America is attacked by terrorists from Country A , then our response will be to bomb the hell out of Country Z , in which Z equals a doormat of a country whose sole purpose is to provide an easy , morale - boosting win .
This strategy has produced mixed results , from total failure to complete catastrophe , depending on variable Z .
The doormats have turned out to be booby - trapped .
Take our most recent example of this counterterror formula : a terrorist from Country A ( Nigeria ) tries and fails to down an American plane .
According to the warped logic of the U.S. foreign - policy establishment , we must naturally attack Country Z— Yemen .
Leaving aside the question of how effective it is to bomb any demographically - exploding Third World country , let ’s follow the hawkish logic : some misfit ca n’t figure out how to blow up his underwear , but we still have to find perpetrators to punish .
Problem is , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is from Nigeria , which has almost 80 million Muslims , the largest number in sub-Saharan Africa .
So that ’s not going to work .
There ’s Saudi Arabia , where al - Qaeda ’s founder , its sponsors , and its ideological support all come from — that would be a logical Country A to bomb .
But the Saudis sponsor the American foreign - policy establishment at least as much as they sponsor anti-American terrorism , so bombing them would be tantamount to suicide for our policymakers .
Then there ’s Pakistan , another logical choice : that country ’s notorious spy service is believed to have been protecting al - Qaeda ’s leadership lo these many years — why not bomb Pakistan ?
Answer : we ’re already fighting , and losing , against a Pakistani proxy army , the Taliban .
Just imagine how much worse things would be if we expanded the conflict to Pakistan proper , which has over five times the population of Afghanistan and nuclear weapons to boot .
Yet the simple - minded hawks need to invade and bomb someone , just so long as it ’s someone they believe will be a pushover ; an easy victory where the results are all but fixed in advance ; some country that could play the military equivalent of the Washington Generals to America ’s Harlem Globetrotters .
That ’s how Yemen , a place Abdulmutallab passed through and supposedly got his training in , becomes the new Country Z — the tangentially related state we need to bomb to make things better .
As far as the meatheads in D.C. know , Yemen should be a pushover .
Otherwise , we ’d have heard something about Yemen by now .
Ah yes , lovely Yemen , the perfect choice for another open - ended war , exactly what the bankrupt , overstretched , kneecapped American empire needs .
It ’s the sort of counterintuitive target the counterintuitive imperialists who have brought us so much ruin would choose for their last gamble : it ’s as if they selected Yemen precisely because there ’s nothing to steal and nothing to conquer .
The only thing a war with Yemen would guarantee is more death , more debt , and generations of anti-American hate to keep our grandchildren busy .
To the serial losers who coaxed America into the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , the losing odds Yemen offers are just too tempting to pass up .
Inside of every Houthi rebel tribesman , there is a tiny , goo - covered Charles Krauthammer trying to get out .
So Sen. Joseph Lieberman goes on television and says , “ Iraq was yesterday ’s war .
… Afghanistan is today ’s war .
If we do n’t act pre-emptively , Yemen will be tomorrow ’s war .
That ’s the danger we face . ”
This sums up just how deranged America ’s hawks have become .
To their minds , wars come in three tenses : past , present , and future .
Leaving aside the fact that Afghanistan was yesterday ’s war before it became today ’s war and that America is still losing both wars in whichever tense Lieberman uses , consider his argument : I gambled American power on Iraq , and I lost ; I ’m now in the process of losing another war .
Therefore , if we do n’t want to lose the next war , we need to start it now — to trick time , so to speak , so that we can fight the future in the present tense .
No wonder American power is collapsing harder than just about any empire in history .
But it ’s not as though Lieberman is displaying any originality .
The politicians and wonks leading America down the drain are following a logic that ’s been operating for the past three and a half decades , always with disastrous results .
It has n’t mattered whether the controls of the U.S. war machine were in the hands of a peanut farmer or a washed - up actor , a rich white chickenhawk or a socialist of color , America ’s military strategy vis-à - vis Islamic terrorism knows no party line — or common sense .
Just look at the record .
In 1975 , America was smarting from defeat in Vietnam , Gerald Ford was president , and a couple of “ bold - thinking ” hotheads in his administration had a brilliant idea for how to restore America ’s confidence .
As luck would have it , Cambodia , one of the world ’s poorest countries , then in the middle of a Khmer Rouge holocaust , offered itself as Country Z. Cambodian Communists seized a U.S. merchant boat , the Mayaguez , and briefly held the crew hostage .
Rather than negotiating for their release , Ford ’s defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , and his underling Dick Cheney pushed for a massive military “ rescue operation . ”
It was a disaster : some 40 American servicemen were killed in the attempt to take control of the island where our sailors were supposedly being held .
In fact , the Americans had already been released before the operation started .
In 1983 , Hezbollah suicide bombers killed 220 Marines , the worst death toll the service has suffered since the battle of Iwo Jima and perhaps the most pointless mass - death of Marines in the outfit ’s brilliant history .
Reagan ’s response : invade Grenada , a resort island a few miles off of Florida .
In his defense , at least he did n’t invade Iraq or Afghanistan , but the basic policy of reacting to terrorism by invading some other “ cakewalk ” country was set .
Also on Reagan ’s watch , Iranian - backed militants in Lebanon kidnapped American citizens and twice blew up the U.S. Embassy .
His response : send the Ayatollah a birthday cake and a Bible , along with shiploads of TOW antitank weapons to help Khomeini fight Iraq .
Still , something had to be done for public consumption , given all the Americans that the Iranians was killing .
So Reagan chose to pick on Col. Muammar Qaddafi , the Gary Numan of scary Muslim villains .
He bombed Qaddafi ’s tents and killed the cross - dresser ’s 4 - year - old daughter .
The last terror attack of the Reagan era came just a few weeks before the 40th president left the White House , when a Pan Am jet was blown up over Scotland .
Everyone and his grandma knew that the Iranians and their Syrian proxies were retaliating for the USS Vincennes shooting down an Iranian passenger jet in the Persian Gulf a few months earlier .
But guess who George H.W. Bush , Reagan ’s replacement , blamed the Pan Am explosion on ?
“ Glass Jaw ” Qaddafi .
Unlike the Iranians , Qaddafi could be counted on to cave and cry uncle , even when he was n’t guilty .
He handed over one of his agents for a show trial in Scotland , and as if it were part of the deal , that Libyan agent was released a few years later by British authorities because he was n’t feeling well , or something like that .
Then there was Clinton .
In 1993 , proto - al - Qaeda terrorists led and funded by Saudi Wahhabis tried blowing up the World Trade Center with van - bombs .
Clinton ’s response : roast a bunch of American Kool - Aid drinkers in Waco , Texas .
( The implication is that Texans are the Libyans of North America , all bark and no bite . )
In October 1993 , Somali terrorists humiliated American forces in the worst military disaster since the 1983 Lebanon barracks bombing .
Briefly , America was sobered up by the experience and decided not to bomb someplace like Bhutan or Upper Volta , though I ’m sure policy planners considered it .
By the time of the Kenya and Tanzania embassy bombings in 1998 , Clinton could n’t hold back , so naturally he destroyed a Sudanese aspirin plant and put on a harmless though expensive fireworks show in Afghanistan .
Under George W. Bush , America ’s asymmetrical strategy went off the scale : Saudis , Kuwaitis , and Egyptians trained in Afghanistan and commanded by a Pakistani attacked America with airplanes , and we responded with a catastrophic invasion of Iraq .
Operations in Afghanistan became a sideshow to the main event in Mesopotamia .
And , as it turns out , right after 9/11 our ultra-hawks considered opening an even more illogical front : a top - secret memo cited in the 9/11 Commission Report — apparently written by Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith for Donald Rumsfeld — urged “ hitting targets outside the Middle East in the initial offensive , ” including Paraguay , Argentina , and Brazil .
The report notes , “ The author suggested … since U.S. attacks were expected in Afghanistan , an American attack in South America or Southeast Asia might be a surprise to the terrorists ” — not to mention a shocker to any member of the reality - based community .
Which brings us to the Nigerian underwear bomber and 2010 ’s pending war in Yemen .
It does n’t take a genius to see how this will end up .
It ’s just too bad that we ’re the ones picking up the tab for Lieberman and company ’s mad misdirection .

Series of events : Google Hacking , removal of support for Google apps , several other vulnerabilities are forcing users to move to alternates .
Recently , at Black Hat DC conference , a security consultant ( Jorge Luis Alvarez Medina ) demoed how it ’s possible to exploit a flaw in Internet Explorer browser that turns your personal computer into a public file server .
In other words , attacker can remotely read files on the victim ’s local drive .
There are a few ways to initiate the attack , which is somewhat complex because you have to “ string alot of the features together to build an attack tool , ” Medina said .
One method involves enticing the victim to click a link to a malicious Web site .
The flaw is said to work across all versions of Internet Explorer , and just ca n’t be fixed in a single shot .
Medina said it does n’t appear that the IE flaw is subject to patching because it encompasses design features related to how IE and Windows Explorer handle zone elevation , HTML code and MIME types .

As a response , Microsoft prompted a security advisory
Our investigation so far has shown that if a user is using a version of Internet Explorer that is not running in Protected Mode an attacker may be able to access files with an already known filename and location .
These versions include Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service 4 ; Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 ; and Internet Explorer 6 , Internet Explorer 7 , and Internet Explorer 8 on supported editions of Windows XP Service Pack 2 , Windows XP Service Pack 3 , and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 .
Protected Mode prevents exploitation of this vulnerability and is running by default for versions of Internet Explorer on Windows Vista , Windows Server 2008 , Windows 7 , and Windows Server 2008 .
A workaround , according to Medina , would include setting “ IE Network Protocol Lockdown , ” adjusting the security level setting for the Internet and Intranet Zones to “ high , ” and disabling Active Scripting for the Internet and Intranet Zones with a custom setting .
Perhaps , the best that can be done is to use a different browser .
One weakness in IE is that it “ does n’t behave consistently .
when accessing the same resources , ” he pointed out .
This exploit leverages it by “ chaining the exploitation of a series of weak features . ”
His dialogue with Microsoft ’s security team about the exploit so far has indicated that Microsoft thinks this is not something it can fix because the flaw is so much a part of the fundamental design of the browser .

Socrates is a very noble guest in Xenophon ’s Symposium .
He attends Kallias ’ banquet because he does n’t want to hurt Kallias ’ feelings ( 1 : 7 ) , and upon seeing Kallias enchanted with Autolycus ( 1 : 10 ) , promotes Kallias as much as possible .
Kallias is complimented mightily on being a good host ( 2 : 3 ) , is defended in his claim he makes men more just through his money ( 4 : 5 ) , relied on for aid in dealing with Hermogenes ’ taciturnity ( 6 : 3 ) , and finally told that his love for Autolycus is not only a good thing , but divinely inspired ( 8 : 37 ) .
There are many other deeds of Socrates in the Symposium , but Strauss has suggested all the deeds are really one : he is exhorting Kallias to love the polis .
The above is only backdrop for our present concern , the character of Antisthenes .
Antisthenes proclaims that he is madly in love with Socrates ( 8 : 4 ) , and Socrates jokingly replies that his love should be kept secret as it is only physical infatuation ( 8 : 6 ) .
Strauss proclaims Antisthenes “ unerotic , ” though , and we have to wonder what is meant by that .
I think those of us who consider ourselves philosophic in some small way , but nowhere near on the level of Socrates , would find ourselves sympathetic to Antisthenes .
1. Antisthenes as philosopher
Unlike Socrates , he has difficulty warming up to the dinner party .
People playing the flute and dancing , lots of food and upper class snobs bragging about how they make people more just through money or know everything because they ’ve memorized Homer via paid tutors – seriously , should n’t a philosopher – should n’t anybody – be offended by how grating it all is ?
There ’s a war going on at the time of this party ( 421 BC is the date the Loeb editor gives ) , and the spirit of celebration can’t possibly be shared by all on command : witness Charmides ’ barely concealed ( and very justifiable ) anger at the demos for his poverty in 4 : 29 -33 .
So Antisthenes represents one who thinks he loves Socrates , but perhaps does n’t truly .
Yet his reaction to this party is more in line with what we would expect from a philosopher than Socrates ’ .
Asked what the most valuable thing he knows is , Antisthenes claims that his pride resides in his wealth , although all know him to be poor .
He holds true wealth to be held in people ’s souls ( 4 : 34-35 ) , for what people are willing to do to each other if they are even remotely insecure about wealth shows many who seem to be wealthy to be poor ( 4 : 35 - 37 – he cites the rich who take risks because of fear of competition , moves to those who squander inheritances , and finally talks about despotism as the enslavement of an entire city for the sake of a few bucks ) .
For himself , though , he says he has too many possessions .
He can eat so that he is satisfied ; he does n’t need too many extra garments or expensive shelters to resist the cold .
He enjoys sleep and finds it difficult to get out of bed .
Women are n’t a problem because he talks only to those who have no one else with whom to converse .
Antisthenes explains the “ most worthy ” possession of his wealth :
If he were robbed , any occupation would provide for him adequately ( 4 : 40 ) .
He can enjoy fancy foods and wines such as the ones at the party , but because he is “ most contented ” with what he has , he is “ least likely to covet what belongs to others ” ( 4 : 42-43 ) .
He credits Socrates for this “ wealth ” of his , says that he is willing to share his spiritual wealth with all , and that his most “ graceful ” ( the word has strong implications of immortality / divinity ) possession is his “ leisure ” ( 4 : 44 ) , by which he can take in many things and hang out with Socrates .
Is Antisthenes not in Socrates ’ league merely because he loves Socrates , and has resigned himself to be a follower ?
Or is there something else about a philosopher , a necessary nobility that Antisthenes does not quite have ?
2 . The trouble with Antisthenes
The trouble is inherent in the very listing of his “ wealth . ”
The whole speech is too pointed , it would be considered a mocking of a less gracious host than Kallias .
Poor Kallias is spending lots of money to feast this man .
If wisdom is moderation , and part of moderation is knowing how to be a philosopher without rubbing it in every 5 seconds , then wisdom is n’t declaring oneself wise and moderate and better than everyone else all the time .
But there ’s more than just the timing of the speech , or his refusal to make fun of himself ( 4 : 62 ) , or his nearly causing a fight with the Syracusean ( a fight the Syracusean deserves , but still – 6 : 8 ) .
The lack of grace is evident in his confusion about what is noble and what is graceful , and you can see that in his listing above .
Usually we would say “ leisure ” is noble , and the ability to be continent – to provide for necessities by not having many in the first place – a particular grace .
Instead , Antisthenes has reversed the order and placed continence under the “ worthy , ” and leisure under divinity .
Now there ’s nothing wrong with reversing this order , necessarily , except that continence is a means for the temperate as well as the intemperate .
If one can control one ’s appetites wholly , one has the potential to be the worst sort of tyrant over men – making them believe that one is a saint while one is really working to be stronger than everyone else so as to dominate .
Continence can mark a greedy general as well as an ascetic , and not all ascetics , of course , are wise merely because they are ascetics .
Sometimes they ’re looking for influence in order to be remembered , and do not really care if they are wise or not .
What reveals Antisthenes as flawed is the one time he praises Kallias .
While he eventually disputes that Kallias can make men more just through money , Antisthenes does like Kallias ’ emphasis on justice .
From Strauss ’ Xenophon ’s Socrates , pg. 149 :
… in Antisthenes ’ view justice is the least disputable kind of gentlemanship , for manliness and wisdom are thought to be sometimes harmful to both friends and the city ( hence unjust ) whereas justice is never in any respect associated with injustice ; he implied that wisdom is at least thought to be compatible with injustice ; he was silent on the harm that manliness and wisdom ( and justice ) can do to their possessor ( Mem. IV 2.33 ) , for the question concerned now the harm to others ; he was silent on continence because it was thought to be compatible with greed ( Mem. I 5.3 )
It would seem to me that Socrates could agree that continence should be subordinate to leisure .
But that is not specific enough – a despot is more than willing to be continent for the sake of leisure .
A despot will happily use means that look just in order to advance injustice .
Understanding what ’s wrong above starts with “ justice is never in any respect associated with injustice ” – is it not the case we do harm to criminals , sometimes excessive harm accidentally ?
From the Republic , Book 1 – is it not just for someone who wishes to guard something well to be familiar with all the ways a thief can operate , perhaps be skilled at stealing himself ?
From Lesser Hippias – is it not the case that Odysseus teaches much about justice and wisdom and rule , all while being a liar ?
3 . So what do we conclude ?
I think Antisthenes is a stand - in for those who wish to understand what Socrates truly stood for , and benefit others .
It ’s not that he is n’t philosophic – he is .
He just has a lot to learn , and should n’t get carried away with how powerful the mind can be .
Happiness for oneself is , in large part , a matter of perception .
But true happiness for oneself and others involves subordinating oneself to what they want to achieve , and showing them what is best through subtle and caring means of persuasion .
Socrates ’ deeds in the Symposium are truly graceful because they are cornball for the most part : he compliments others frequently and avoids insulting anyone .
Charmides and Antisthenes and Hermogenes all are in Socrates ’ circle , and have legitimate complaints against being at the party .
Antisthenes seems to me to be an incomplete philosopher , one who has a little bit of growing up to do .
When he grows a bit more , he ’ll realize just how much the philosopher is a guest , how much he would rather not be the center of attention ( 9 : 4 - 6 ) .

On the wrong side of the coin Oleg Yuriev takes a black tomcat to the crossroadson Christmas Eve to gain new perspectives on the nature of money .
1. Selling a black tomcat at the crossroads on Christmas Eve .
The motif of a coin or a bank - note , in other words a piece of money , that cannot be spent is a motif that exists in folklore the world over .
The money always returns to its owner .
The purchased wares / and or services , however stay where they are – practical , eh ?
The only thing you can't do is get change ( leave it on the counter or give it as a tip : keep the change ! ) otherwise the coin loses its magic power .
This serviceable item can be acquired through one or other magical operations of middling difficulty .
In Russian , for example , you have to tie up a black tomcat with a tarred piece of string , take it to a particular crossroads on Christmas Eve , and sell the caterwauling creature to a certain Somebody ( who will appear automatically ) for one silver rouble ( no less , no more , however many millions are offered ! )
This , at least , is how the procedure is described by a wonderful Russian writer Nikolai Leskov ( 1831 – 1895 ) in his story of 1894 about " The Magic Rouble . "
Undoubtedly this fairytale motif reflects the ( all too ) human desire to be relieved of material concerns , the dream of the land of milk and honey .
A pocket land of milk and honey , so to say .
But we know and the fairytale knows that this is impossible – folklore as a whole seems to be almost entirely void of a story in which the possession of a coin that always returns to its owner ends happily every after .
Sooner or later the coin is lost and everything it brought ends in misery .
It 's as if such a thing was not intended for us .
This is the difference between magic money and other magic objects which pay in kind – the magic wishing table , for example , which lays on a spread whenever asked .
If it 's not meant for us , who is it meant for !?
II .
Money is uncanny
Money is a relatively recent discovery in the history of man and we have still not come to terms with it .
What is money and why does it buy everything , where does it come from and where does it go ?
- our forbears shuddered at all these questions , until the economists of the 18th and 19th centuries convinced us ( and themselves ) that they could explain it .
And since then , we have been shuddering at all their answers .
Magic money shows the fear that simple people have of the magic of money .
Another ( and more general ) manifestation of the same fear is " money fetishism " as Karl Marx liked to call it .
Perhaps it is because of all this fear and idolisation , that the motif of the magic coin has enjoyed such little currency in Western art and philosophy .
After all what metaphorical basis does it offer us ?
We naturally identify with the owner of the coin , and this brings nothing except moral and pragmatic platitudes : work and expect nothing for free , there 's no such thing as a free lunch .
We know all this already : the good Lord Money taught us that thousands of years ago !
Admittedly the possession of a magic coin is a triumph , if fleeting , over the uncanny powers of an almighty god ; but Westerners have long since abandoned their beliefs in such triumphs , and what 's more , in recent times they have settled into an amicable arrangement with the money fetish .
The idol has become relatively merciful .
Of course we could never ( nor would we want to ) say that everything is rosy , but ... if things do n't get worse , we are quite content ...
Why should we want to start thinking about some bouncing coins ?
Everything is fairly clear is n't it ?
Surplus value , productivity , globality .
In contemporary Russian literature , on the other hand , which , for professional reasons , I observe systematically , three or four prose pieces and countless poems are published per year , which deal in some way or touch on the motif of the magic rouble .
The motif has made a comeback .
This probably has something to do with the fact that Russia ( as at the end of the 19th century when Leskov wrote " The Magic Rouble " ) is once again in a transition phase between commodity fetishism and money fetishism , and the Russian population is struggling to keep up .
It was different in the Soviet era .
In the classical ( ideological ) Soviet society of the 30s through to the 60s , it was not money ( the defeated capitalist god ) that determined a person 's value , but his proximity to power , his direct share in it .
Later , in the internally de-ideologised USSR of the 70s and 80s , it was , again , not money itself but consumer goods that were the focus of society 's interest - as would be expected of an economy of scarcity .
III : Back to the here and now – on the wrong side of the money
First and foremost we are interested in the here and now , and not in a lot of old stories from the East .
Of course .
We live in the here and now .
And money is flowing through each one of us here and now .
It enters and leaves ...
But where does it go ?
Let 's look at the flip side of the situation with the magic coin - not through the eyes of the coin 's owner , but from the perspective of the baker or butcher , who are on the losing end when the coin bounces out of the till .
Suddenly there 's a lot more to see .
Everything gets a lot more interesting and - most importantly – more personal .
We suddenly see that the paradigm of the magic money reflects the entire way Western civilisation functions , and what 's more , how it effects us .
It 's just that we are not the ones who pay with the magic coin ; we are the ones who get paid with it .
We are not buyers .
We are sellers , just as old Marx tried to try to tell us .
But under the pressure of consumer propaganda we have , to this veryday , failed to take his warning on board .
We sell our work , our time , our bodies .
And occasionally our black tomcats , too , not that we have any takers .
And we get money in return for our wares , but where is it all ?
Money disappears , we all know this .
The person who pays us the money probably gets it back .
He already has the goods and he seems to have the money as well .
So it must be our money that is filling his pockets .
We are simply on the wrong side of the coin .
Somebody else has the magic coin and we are living off the change that he forgot on the counter , or left as a tip .
The rest is for you .
- Thank you Mr. Somebody .
In principle we are living off tips ( that here and now are generous , so we are ... no , of course we 're not content , but ... we can survive ... )
But who is this other person , the owner of the magic money , who seems to have the entire social and economic system in his grasp ?
Different people will give different answers to this question – depending on their political and philosophical views , experiences and ranking in society .
Everyone knows ( or thinks they know ) to whom and what they are selling - work , time , bodies or black tomcats , whether it be employer , state or audience .
And the point of turning things around is to find the person with the magic coin : the great , anonymous one .
The great , anonymous one , however , will not be so easy to find , probably impossible to find if " he " does not want to be found , but it is more important to start looking and to learn some stuff along the way .
It 's not so much about finding that lot - to find yourself ( or at least see yourself from another perspective ) would be pretty good going .
Alone the possibility of being able to answer the central question of our time " Where does all the money go ? " with " It goes back where it came from " is a light to guide us in the dark .
Even before we have defined that lot .
The first thing that springs to mind , of course , is the credit services sector , " the banks " who are the real villains in most people 's way of thinking .
Without wanting to absolve these " loan sharks " of blame , I do want to keep them out of this story : the money that we " borrow " from the bank is bought at great expense .
This in not money that we receive in payment and then discover is missing from the till .
We know all along that it 's not ours forever .
So I 'm not talking about these " profiteers " .
And ultimately it would be too easy and uninteresting to think of them as that lot .
After all , everyone else thinks of them as that lot .
IV .
In the land of the farmasons
Our image also functions at a macro-economic level .
Now we find ourselves , as inhabitants of the wealthy West / North , on the right side of the money for once , which makes the fact that we are " on the wrong side at a personal level " more bearable and financially secure .
The wealthy West / North is apparently in possession of a magic coin which always returns , no matter how much money - whether in aid , payment for raw materials or cheap labour – the East / South gets ( we wo n't include loans here , although they could be said to represent a form of gift or payment whose repayment is neither expected nor even wanted . )
In the family tree of Eastern European legends about returning money , there is one , very tender branch : the belief that somewhere " in the threetimesninth land in a threetimestenth state " – as Russian folklore calls a fairytale kingdom , there is a magical land – where the " farmasons " live ( a folksy pronounciation of the franc - maçons or freemasons ) .
The " farmasons " - in 19th century Russian argot the word simply meant " scoundrels " or " thieves " - are the ones who , in their " farmason land " are in possession of the magic money .
This is where it originated , this is its home .
In the 19th century , the land of the farmasons might have meant some sort of folkloristic kingdom , but today it clearly means Europe , " the land of holy miracles " , as Fyodor Dostoyevsky half - mockingly - half - admiringly called it .
Or more precisely : the European Union .
This is why the desire of the Eastern and Southern European countries to join the EU has an exaggeratedly sacred , irrational undertone – they all want to get onto the right side of the money .
The EU is an inexhaustible bag of coins according to the " hopeful candidates " ( although the Brussels Eurocrats seem to be of the same opinion ) .
But that 's a slightly different fairytale motif and it would lead us metaphorically to very different , if fertile , territory , which has more to do with the understanding of money as a raw material , a natural product which , for unexplained reasons , is made available to certain individuals and peoples .
So it does no one any harm to take from it , endlessly .
This explains how budget structuring works in certain state and superstate organs , but it does n't bring us any closer to the mysterious being behind the image of the magic money .
This image is much more closely related to the nature of money , which we are discussing here , than with human nature or the nature of nature .
It seems important to reinstate the motif of ever - returning money in the ( collective ) consciousness .
Particularly here , in the homeland of the magic coin , and now , at the peak of its power .
It is always worth gain a better understanding of things , as the history of the human race would teach us , had it not refused to some time ago .
History is in the middle of a teacher 's strike , you might say .
Thank God geography 's still being taught : the farmasons are living in the " threetimesninth land in a threetimestenth state " – at least we still know that .
V. The ( post ) Marxist ( magic ) formula
At this point I could declare my duty done , having reinstated the motif of the magic coin in the collective consciousness .
To do more is not a matter for a single author , you 'd need lots of thinkers and artists from different cultures to contribute .
What worries me and keeps me from wrapping up this tract , is the fate of the poor black tomcat which , on Christmas Eve , was tied up with tarred rope and sold , caterwauling , to someone for a silver rouble at the crossroads of four streets ( one of which leads to the graveyard ) .
Why does this somebody need him , and what happens to him next ?
What becomes of him ?
The cat , I mean .
... Suddenly I know the answer !
The cat will be trained as a ' magical helper ' .
These are the creatures in the fairytale world who help the heroes achieve their goals .
They are often animals : a wolf , a hunch - backed pony , a cat .
Puss - in - Boots , for example .
... Does every cat get boots ?
I allow myself to doubt it .
With or without boots , our black tomcat will emerge from his training , able to transform himself into whatever commodity he chooses , whereupon he will be offered for sale by his owner .
As soon as he 's been sold , he will turn back into a cat and return to his owner .
Clever , eh ?
This is another great eye - opener .
Because we live in a consumer world which supplies us with a steady flow of things of questionable necessity which , shortly afterwards , disappear again ( whether it be into the bin , the cellar , oblivion or thin air ! )
On both micro and macro-economic levels !
...
But what happens if they meet again , the black tomcat and the magic coin ?
If you pay for disappearing goods that return to their owner with disappearing money that returns to its owner ?
What if we add a black tomcat ( T ) to Marx 's formula of C( ommodity ) - M( oney ) - C ( ommodity ) :
T - M - C = M - C - T , or simply T - T - T ?
Would that be an allegorical confusion or its opposite ?
It 's something us economists , poets and philosophers need consider in more depth .
VI . P. S .
And what happens when the owner of the world 's magic money summons it all back at once , out of our purses , tills and banks ?
Correct : financial meltdown .

A question came up how StackOverflow , blah .
I have heard about this behaviour being valid in C++ , so I thought I would test it on the CLR .
.class Program { . method static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { . entrypoint .locals init ( [ 0 ] class Program p ) ldloc.0 // but wait , it 's still null !
call instance void Program :: Awesome ( ) ret } . method instance void Awesome ( ) { ldstr " Awesome ! " call void [ mscorlib ] System .
Console :: WriteLine ( string ) ret } . method public specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor ( ) { ldarg.0 call instance void [ mscorlib ] System .
Object ::.ctor ( ) ret } }
As you can see if you compile the program , “ Awesome ! ” is printed .
Now run PEVerify .
As you can see , perfect valid CLR code .
But how ?
And why wont in work in C# ?
The C# compiler will in all cases ( even weirdly , but probably for good reason ) emit a callvirt instead of the call I used .
This causes the runtime to perform a null check .
Secondly , the is no instance member access , so no references to ‘ this ’ need to be made .
Why is this like this ?
Not sure , but if I would guess , they left this specification loose , to allow for more flexibility in other languages .
American Students Charles Gill And Ryan Knight Arrested For Throwing Showballs : Face 5 Years Jail
IN America , the people are so free that even the cops are free to issue “ felony snowball throwing charges ” against Virginia college students Charles Gill and Ryan Knight for throwing snowballs at a snowplough and an undercover police car .
The 21 - year - olds study at James Madison University were arrested and jailed .
They face between one and five years in prison , and a maximum $ 2,500 fine .
That ’s freedom .

She authors a blog at hiyaablog.com .
Anyone with a smartphone can scan and read QR codes with the click of a camera , and anyone with access to a computer can generate QR codes themselves .
BayBrain's Snappr.net offers a QR bar code generator and links to a comprehensive list of software for code reading .
By scanning the codes , you can access images , websites and text .
By creating the codes , you can produce your own messages .
Usually synonymous with mass production , the quick response ( QR ) bar code was originally created by Japanese company Denso - Wave to keep inventory .
However , because QR codes allow for more data than the standard 10 - digit bar code , and because scanning requires less effort than typing a URL , the QR has taken a turn for the personal .
The genius behind QR codes is that even a hairless chimp can play with them .
Below are five of my favorite uses :
Got any cool uses for QR codes ?
Share in the comments below .
1. SWAG and Self Branding
Users can embed code with text or links to their favorite images , music and sites .
Upon creating a QR code , Snappr then offers you a chance to transfer the bar codes to hats , mugs and even baby gear .
Because the point of the code is to provide additional info to passersby , there are a ton of potential uses for it .
You can proactively provide speed dates with background info , fundraise on - site during charity events , or simply advertise .
I 'd avoid any permanent tattoos , but these temporary ones could be cool promo pieces .
2. Geo-Based Reviews and Tours
A pilot program between CitySearch and Antenna Audio began in Spring 2008 .
Reviews and audio snippets were embedded into codes on San Francisco historical landmarks and restaurants .
Foodies and tourists enjoyed self - guided tours of the Bay .
In a year , despite the fact that the same codes will remain posted on the same landmarks and restaurants , tours may evolve into something drastically different .
If a QR code is linked to a public review site , a wiki , or a forum , anyone can lend a hand in chronicling a site 's history .
Obviously this has its pros and cons .
3. Green Ticketing
This summer Eventbrite , tested a QR code program for concert and party registration .
Meant to increase efficiency and reduce waste , this type of registration will likely become more popular as camera and scanner technology improves .
In the future , codes could be used to signify race checkpoints with sports fans tracking their favorite cyclists and motorists in real time from their phones .
4. Geek Chiq Fashion
Lendorff .
Kaywa produced only 500 high - end limited edition Space Invaders QR code scarves .
Meanwhile , QRCode Commando
Nerd p8tch offers a slightly more affordable " p8tch " to sew to bags and clothing .
The patches are less likely to be used for branding than the Snappr merch as they link to a URL on the Swiss domain p8t.ch and users must then redirect .
That being said , you 've always got the opportunity to elegantly Rickroll your unsuspecting public .
5. Secrets & Acts of Defiance
In 2007 , the Pet Shop Boys released a single criticizing the British national identity card concept .
The single came complete with a QR code linked to the critique .
Fine , you do n't like the Pet Shop Boys .
Still , it 's interesting to see that the codes can be used to subvert regimes .
Environmentalists can sticker products and link to corporate crimes , artists can satirize the man by postering government buildings , and Kevin Bacon can finally organize a footloose dance - off free of oppressive townies .
The potential for activism and buffoonery is limitless .
You are the master of your QR Code Destiny !

The CIA 's Declassified History of the Glomar Explorer
Posted - February 12 , 2010
Edited by Matthew Aid with William Burr and Thomas Blanton

The Hughes Glomar Explorer
( U.S. Government photo ) Glomarization
The name of the CIA ship Hughes Glomar Explorer is infamous in the world of FOIA requesting and litigation .
In the wake of the exposés on the Glomar Explorer by Jack Anderson and Seymour Hersh , journalist Harriet Ann Phillippi filed a FOIA request asking for documents on the Agency 's attempts to discourage reporting on the CIA 's salvaging project .
Rejecting Phillippi's request , the Agency declared that it could " neither confirm nor deny " its connection with the Glomar Explorer .
Phillippi filed a lawsuit , but the U.S. District Court of Appeals upheld the CIA 's position in 1976 .
Since the Phillippi v CIA decision , the term " glomarize " or " glomar response " have become terms of art to describe the circumstances when the CIA or other agencies claim that they can " neither confirm nor deny " the existence of requested documents .
No doubt the CIA will continue to make " Glomar " responses to some declassification requests , but in light of this new release , it is unlikely to " glomarize " the Glomar Explorer .
A Soviet Golf class submarine , the type of ship that " Project Azorian " was trying to recover from the bottom of the Pacific .

The New York Times , March 19 , 1975 Inconsistent Secrecy ?
On January 24 , 2010 , the Washington Post 's letters to the editor 's section included a communication from retired CIA officer David Sharp , who served on the crew of the Hughes Glomar Explorer .
Sharp has written a book - length account of the Glomar Explorer project but has tried in vain to get the CIA 's Publication Review Board to declassify his manuscript in its entirety .
According to Sharp 's letter , the Board continues to insist that one - third of the manuscript cannot be published .
Perhaps the decision by the CIA FOIA office to declassify the 1985 Studies in Intelligence article on " Project Azorian " will give Mr. Sharp some leverage in his negotiations with the Review Board .
Washington , D.C. , February 12 , 2010 - For the first time , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) has declassified substantive information on one of its most secret and sensitive schemes , " Project Azorian , " the Agency codename for its ambitious plan to raise a sunken Soviet submarine from the floor of the Pacific Ocean in order to retrieve its secrets .
Today the National Security Archive publishes " Project Azorian : The Story of the Hughes Glomar Explorer , " a 50 - page article from the fall 1985 edition of the Agency 's in - house journal Studies in Intelligence .
Written by a participant in the operation whose identity remains classified , the article discusses the conception and planning of the retrieval effort and the creation of a special ship , the Glomar Explorer , which raised portions of the submarine in August 1974 .
The National Security Archive had submitted a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request to the CIA for the document on December 12 , 2007 .
National Security Archive director Tom Blanton commented that " the Navy alternative to the Glomar Explorer -- investigation by a deep sea submersible -- sounds more convincing than the claim in the Studies in Intelligence article that Project Azorian advanced the cutting edge of deep sea exploration the way the CIA did on aerial and satellite reconnaissance .
To me , Glomar resembles the Bay of Pigs more than U - 2 or Corona .
On the latter , they brought in the best people , Ed Land and the Skunk Works , on the former , they only talked to themselves . "
Also published today for the first time are recently declassified White House memoranda of conversations from 1975 which recount the reactions of President Ford and cabinet members to ongoing news of press leaks about the Glomar Explorer , including Seymour Hersh 's exposé in The New York Times on March 19 , 1975 .
Project Azorian
The CIA 's Declassified History of the Glomar Explorer
By Matthew Aid
For the first time , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) has declassified substantive information on one of its most secret and sensitive schemes , " Project Azorian , " the Agency codename for its ambitious plan to raise a sunken Soviet submarine from the floor of the Pacific Ocean in order to retrieve its secrets .
Today the National Security Archive publishes " Project Azorian : The Story of the Hughes Glomar Explorer , " a " Secret " 50 - page article from the fall 1985 edition of the Agency 's in - house journal Studies in Intelligence .
Written by a participant in the operation whose identity remains classified , the article discusses the conception and planning of the retrieval effort and the creation of a special ship Glomar Explorer , which raised portions of the submarine in August 1974 .
The National Security Archive submitted a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request to the CIA for the document on December 12 , 2007 .
Also published today for the first time are recently - declassified White House memoranda of conversations from 1975 recounting the reactions of President Ford and cabinet members to ongoing news of press leaks about the Glomar Explorer , including Seymour Hersh 's exposé in The New York Times on March 19 , 1975 .
The first sketchy details of the program were published by the Los Angeles Times in February 1975 and by columnist Jack Anderson in a March 18 radio program , and were further developed in Hersh 's March 19 article in the New York Times .
Since then the CIA has been so adamant in its refusal to declassify any material related to " Project Azorian " that it will neither confirm nor deny that the operation ever existed .
This doctrine changed slightly in the 1990s , when the Agency declassified a videotape given previously to Russian president Boris Yeltsin showing the burial at sea of the Russian crewmen who were found in the portion of the submarine that the CIA raised to the surface .
But other than this videotape , for the past 35 years the public has had to rely for everything that it knew about the project on a very small number of books and articles written without access to the classified records .
( Note 1 )
This newly - released CIA document vastly expands what we know about this poorly - understood operation .
Despite significant redactions made by the CIA , the article contains a detailed chronological history of the program from its inception until Jack Anderson published the first hard details about the program in April 1975 .
Internal evidence suggests that the article was written in 1978 , but it was prepared at such a high level of classification that it was apparently unpublishable until the Agency made decisions in 1985 to downgrade it to " Secret . "
The story of " Project Azorian " began on March 1 , 1968 , when a Soviet Golf - II submarine , the K - 129 ( the CIA history refers to the submarine by its pendant number - 722 ) , carrying three SS - N - 4 Sark nuclear - armed ballistic missiles , sailed from the naval base at Petropavlovsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula to take up its peacetime patrol station northeast of Hawaii .
If war had broken out , the K - 129 would have launched its three ballistic missiles , each carrying a one megaton nuclear warhead , at targets along the west coast of the United States .
But something went terribly wrong , for in mid-March 1968 the submarine suffered a catastrophic accident and sank 1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii with the loss of its entire crew .
Interestingly , the CIA history is silent on the cause of the accident , mentioning neither how the agency came to learn of the sub 's demise nor the exact location of its resting place 16,500 feet below the surface of Pacific .
It is quite likely that this information was Top Secret , and could not be included in the article at the Secret classification level , despite the fact that books and articles about the project back in the 1970s mention that the U.S. Navy 's SOSUS underwater sonar system detected the location of the sunken submarine .
The article traces in detail the trials and tribulations of " Project Azorian " over the next six years , culminating on August 8 , 1974 , when the commercial vessel specially modified to perform the secret mission , the Hughes Glomar Explorer , raised a portion of the K - 129 to the surface and took it to Hawaii for detailed examination .
The declassified article is replete with information that has never been made public before now :
On July 1 , 1969 , the CIA established the Special Projects Staff within its Directorate of Science and Technology to manage " Project Azorian . "
The head of the unit was John Parangosky , a senior official in the CIA 's Directorate of Science and Technology who had previously managed the development and operation of a number of highly - classified CIA aerial reconnaissance systems .
His deputy , and the man who ran the day - to - day operations of Project Azorian for the next six years , was a U.S. Naval Academy graduate and World War II submarine officer named Ernest " Zeke " Zellmer .
President Richard Nixon personally approved the creation of the special task force in August 1969 . ( pp. 4 - 5 )
With President Nixon 's approval in hand , on August 19 , 1969 , CIA director Richard Helms placed all information concerning the work being done by Parangosky and Zellmer 's staff in a special security compartment called " Jennifer , " thus restricting all knowledge of what these men were doing to a very small and select group of people inside the White House and the U.S. intelligence community , including President Richard Nixon and his national security advisor , Henry Kissinger .
It should be noted that in the 1970s , a number of books and articles claimed incorrectly that " Jennifer " was the name of the operation .
( p. 5 )
It was not until October 1970 that a team of CIA engineers and specially - cleared contractors determined that the only technically - feasible way to lift the huge 1,750 - ton Soviet submarine off the sea floor was to slip a specially - made sling made out of pipe - strings around the submarine , then slowly raise the sub to the surface using heavy - duty winches mounted on a specially - modified ship built for this purpose .
( p. 9 , 15 )
Initially , senior intelligence officials were not particularly optimistic about the chances of success for the operation , believing that there was only a 10 percent chance that the operation would succeed .
( p. 11 )
In August 1971 , during the early research and development stage of the program , " Project Azorian " came within inches of being cancelled because of huge cost overruns .
According to the article , the only thing that saved the program from being terminated was the potential intelligence bonanza that would accrue if the project succeeded .
Despite deep concerns about rising costs on the part of the officials overseeing " Project Azorian , " on October 4 , 1971 the CIA was authorized to proceed with the program .
( pp. 13 , 15 )
Work began immediately building a ship specifically designed to conduct the operation .
On November 16 , 1971 , the keel was laid at the Sun Shipbuilders yard in Chester , Pennsylvania of what would become the Hughes Glomar Explorer .
The initial schedule called for the ship to be launched on October 5 , 1972 , and delivered to the CIA on April 20 , 1973 . ( p. 15 )
The developing U.S. - Soviet détente , symbolized by the cordial meetings between President Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev at the May 1972 Moscow summit , threatened to derail Azorian .
In July 1972 , the special Executive Committee , which oversaw the project , asked the high - level and top secret 40 Committee , which oversaw all sensitive intelligence operations , to review the project due to the possibility that , by the time it was ready for deployment in 1974 , " the developing political climate might prohibit mission approval . "
The views of other senior government officials cleared for access to " Project Azorian " were also solicited .
The response was far from positive .
The Deputy Secretary of Defense , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the Chief of Naval Operations , the Assistant Secretary of Defense ( Intelligence ) , and the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) all recommended that " Project Azorian " be terminated because , in addition to the rapidly rising costs of the program and the political risks involved , the value of the anticipated intelligence gain from the operation was probably less than what the CIA believed .
Despite the impressive heft of these negative assessments of " Project Azorian , " on December 11 , 1972 , President Richard Nixon ordered that the program be continued .
This proved to be the last major bureaucratic obstacle that " Project Azorian " had to clear .
( pp. 16-19 )
While docked at the port of Long Beach , California between October 1973 and January 1974 , 24 vans containing the classified equipment needed to perform the mission were loaded aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer . ( p. 25 )
In November 1973 , a strike by union members belonging to the Marine Engineers Benevolent Association ( MEBA ) disrupted the completion of the fitting out of the Hughes Glomar Explorer for its mission at Long Beach .
Because the mission could only be accomplished during a ten week " weather window " between July and mid-September , CIA officials were concerned that the delay could cause the ship to miss its deployment date .
If that had happened , the mission would have been delayed for an entire year until the next period of favorable weather conditions occurred .
( pp. 27 -28 )
On June 7 , 1974 , President Nixon personally approved launching the " Project Azorian " mission , with the stipulation that the Hughes Glomar Explorer not begin its work until after he had returned from a summit meeting in Moscow scheduled to last from June 27 , 1974 , to July 3 , 1974 .
The Glomar Explorer arrived at the recovery site 1,560 miles northwest of Hawaii on July 4 , 1974 , the day after Nixon left Moscow .
Recovery operations commenced immediately to attach the pipe - string collars around the Soviet submarine . ( pp. 36 - 37 )
The Hughes Glomar Explorer 's recovery operations were greatly complicated by almost 14 days of near - continuous surveillance of the ship 's work by two Soviet naval vessels .
Despite the presence of the Soviet surveillance vessels , recovery work did not stop .
But fearing that the Soviets might try to land personnel on his ship by helicopter , on July 18 , 1974 , the CIA mission director on the Glomar Explorer ordered crates stacked on his ship 's helicopter deck to prevent the Soviets from landing on it .
According to the article , orders were given to " be prepared to order emergency destruction of sensitive material which could compromise the mission if the Soviets attempted to board the ship .
The team designated to defend the control room long enough to destroy the material ... was alerted , but guns were not issued . " ( p. 39 )
The Hughes Glomar Explorer began lifting the K - 129 off the sea floor on August 1 , 1974 , more than three weeks after the ship arrived at the recovery site .
It took eight days to slowly winch the remains of the Soviet submarine into the massive hold of the Glomar Explorer , with the sub finally being secured inside the ship on August 8 , 1974 .
The next day , recovery operations were completed and the ship sailed for Hawaii to offload its haul .
( pp. 43 - 46 )
Unfortunately , the CIA made significant deletions from the text of the article , which makes it extremely difficult to accurately gauge just how successful " Project Azorian " was .
For example , the CIA refused to declassify any information concerning the massive cost overruns , which threatened to shut down the program during its early stages .
Subsequent reports estimate that as much as $ 500 million ( in 1974 dollars ) were spent .
Nor did the declassified portions of the CIA article answer the critically important questions of how much of the submarine the Hughes Glomar Explorer managed to bring to the surface , or what intelligence information was derived from the exploitation of the portions of the sub that were recovered .
Unfortunately , this material apparently was either redacted from the text or not included because of the high classification assigned to this material .
So what can we surmise about what " Project Azorian " accomplished ?
Because the CIA article provides no answers to this critical question , the prevailing school of thought maintains that the project failed to accomplish its primary goals .
Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Seymour Hersh's March 1975 New York Times article reported that the mission was , in the opinion of senior U.S. Navy officials , a failure , because the CIA did not recover any of the K - 129's SS - N - 4 nuclear - armed ballistic missiles .
Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew 's 1998 book Blind Man's Bluff reported that only a 38 - foot long forward section of the K - 129 was recovered , including the sub 's torpedo compartment and its store of Russian nuclear torpedoes .
Ninety percent of the highly - fragile submarine , including the conning tower , missile compartment , control room , radio shack and engine room , broke free and fell back to the ocean floor , disintegrating on contact .
" Back to the ocean floor went the intact [ SS - N - 4 ] nuclear missile , the codebooks , decoding machines , the burst transmitters .
Everything the CIA most wanted to reclaim . "
And because only small fragments survived the disintegration of the submarine when it hit bottom , the CIA decided not to make a second attempt to retrieve what was left .
Sontag and Drew argue that a Navy proposal to use a deep - sea submersible to probe the sunken vessel was never properly vetted , although it may have produced better results .
( Note 2 )
There apparently were some tangential benefits that accrued from the project .
In June 1993 , a panel of Russian experts prepared a report for President Boris Yeltsin , using only information made available to them by the Russian intelligence services , which concluded that the CIA recovered at least two nuclear - armed torpedoes from the portion of the K - 129 that it managed to bring to the surface .
According to the report , the level of plutonium radiation the CIA team on the Hughes Glomar Explorer encountered was consistent with two nuclear warheads .
( Note 3 ) This conclusion is partially confirmed in the surviving text of the CIA article , which reported that Glomar Explorer 's recovery crew had to deal with plutonium contamination once the sub was raised to the surface caused by the one - point detonation of the high explosive components of one or more of the K - 129 's nuclear torpedoes .
( p. 46 )
So was " Project Azorian " a waste of time and taxpayer money ?
We will not know for sure until the CIA declassifies the remainder of this article and other documents relating to this operation .

Calling his national security team together , President Ford expressed his worries about leaks to the press , such as reports on recent National Security Council discussions of the SALT [ Strategic Arms Limitations Talks ] .
During the course of the discussion , Director of Central Intelligence ( DCI ) William Colby interjected that he had been in touch with the Los Angeles Times , whose editors were going to publish an article about the Glomar Explorer .
He said that he called Franklin D. Murphy , the chief executive officer of the Times - Mirror Company , which published the Times , but his call was to no avail .
The next afternoon , February 8 , 1975 , it ran a story entitled " U.S. Reported After Russian Submarine / Sunken Ship Deal by CIA . "

The day that Seymour Hersh 's story appeared in The New York Times , Ford also met with top advisers .
Secretary of Defense ( and former Director of Central Intelligence ) Schlesinger recommended acknowledging the " bare facts " because it was implausible to deny the story .
DCI Colby , however , thought otherwise and his advice prevailed .
Remembering that President Eisenhower 's admission of the downed U - 2 exacerbated the 1960 crisis , he suggested that confirming the story would put Moscow under " pressure to respond . "

The Case Against Bike Paths
( Anyone who was at last December ’s Bike Meeting in City Hall witnessed a mini-shouting match between Enci Box and Councilman Tom LaBonge over whether or not there are " bike facilities " in LaBonge ’s district .
Enci contends that a bike path is not a real facility , and she elaborates and explains that point here .
– DN )
Cyclists who get into a discussion of safe and effective cycling on the
streets of Los Angeles often encounter the wistful suggestion that " we
need Bike Paths ! " and then the conversation is taken over by the world
travelers in the group who tell tales of Bike Paths from around the
globe .
As someone who was born in Hungary , grew up in Germany , and has
traveled extensively in Europe , Australia and North America , I ’m
familiar with the many variations of " Bike Paths " that can be found
around the world and it ’s from this point of view that I find myself
taking the lonely position that " Here in Los Angeles , Bike Paths are
not a ‘ safe and effective cycling ’ solution and in many cases , they are
a problem . "
A Bike Path is a paved
and separate right - of - way path ( also referred to as a Class I Bikeways
facility in California ) and is , for the most part , intended as a
shared - use path for non-motorized traffic , in spite of the " Bike Path "
name .
In other words , Bike Paths are typically open to pedestrians ,
joggers , baby strollers , roller - bladers , dog - walkers and other
non-motorized users unless there is a separate path for their use .
( such as the Santa Monica Bike Path ) .
The key element of a Bike Path is
that it is " separated " from street traffic by open space or in most
cases a barrier .
My objections to Bike Paths are based on my desire to ride safely , to
get where I need to go , and to ride on the streets in a city that
incorporates cycling as a transportation solution .
I feel that the Bike
Paths designed and built in Los Angeles are unsafe , secluded , isolated ,
disconnected from meaningful destinations , and show a municipal desire
to remove cyclists from the traffic mix .
To top it off , they squander
the money set aside for Bikeways improvements with little if any
transportation mode - share benefit .
If that is n’t enough , cyclists who
ride on Bike Paths ride at their own risk while cyclists on the street
enjoy the protection available to all Californians who are hurt on a
public road , sidewalk or bike lane due to the negligence of a
municipality .
But my real objections against Bike Paths are based on what I
experience when I ride on the LA River Path , the Orange Line Bike Path ,
the Chandler Bike Path , the Ballona Creek Bike Path and the Bike Paths
at the beach .
Here are the reasons for my Objection :
Safety : In LA , the Bike Paths are often segregated from the
community with walls , fences and shrubbery that create a closed off ,
hostile environment .
The sound wall on the Orange Line protects the
neighbors from the sound of the Metro buses but it also means that a
cyclist who needs help ca n’t be heard by the community .
The seclusion
is so effective that the Orange Line turned into a homeless encampment .
It was then that the community discovered that both the LAPD and the
Sheriff ’s Department both thought the other agency was in charge of law
enforcement for the Orange Line Bike Path .
When one falls , gets injured , or has a medical emergency
they are n’t able to call for help because the walls and fences shield
their cry for help .
they are n’t able to call for help because the walls and fences shield their cry for help .
When people are attacked on a Bike Path , there are n’t any witnesses and again , their cries for help are n’t heard .
Rape , gang attack , punching , mugging , assault and murder are just a
few of the incidents that happen on Bike Paths , and these incidents
happen at any time of the day .
Bike Paths that have chain link fencing ,
sound walls and landscaping that offers hiding places are not safe .
Adding to the risk is the fact that if something happens and a cyclist
uses a cell phone to call for help , what ’s the address ?
Metro tunnels
have markers , hiking trails have markers , why not the Bike Paths in LA ?

David Santor , a Ballona Creek regular , was " ambushed " as he rode the Bike Path in the late afternoon by four young men who
threw him over the rail and stole his bike , leaving David battered and
bruised and with broken bones .

Another cyclist on Ballona Creek was riding at 1 pm when he was attacked by two men who threw a bike at him and knocked him down , dosed him with pepper
spray and then stole his back pack .
When the cyclist went to the local
police department , the officer taking the report kept asking " but what
street were you on ? "

The
incidents on the Ballona Creek Bike Path prompted the City Council ’s
Transportation Committee to get involved and it was there that I argued
" Closing off access hardly makes it safer and would result in less
traffic which will contribute to an even more unsafe environment . "
Councilman Bill Rosendahl and the LAPD chose to close the gates and to further
isolate the cyclists .
Closing off access hardly makes it safer and
would result in less traffic which will contribute to an even more
unsafe environment .
Grrr !
If one feels threatened by a group of people , they do n’t have enough
room to turn around quickly or find a nearby exit to escape the route ,
which then can lead to any of the above mentioned incidents .
If the path is closed down , people have to figure out how to get to
their destination on streets that they ’re not familiar with .
Liability :
In a clear demonstration of the City of LA’s
commitment to safe and effective cycling , the City of Los Angeles
fought all the way to the California State Appellate Court to have Bike
Paths declared " trails " and arguing that cyclists who ride on Bike
Paths " ride at their own risk " just as in other recreational pursuits .
The case involved a cyclist who was riding the Los Angeles Rive Path
and was injured by what he claims was a poorly designed gate .
The City
avoided debating the design and maintenance of the Bike Path and
instead simply argued the " ride at your own risk " defense .
Sadly , the
City prevailed .
This means that the city is not liable for any injuries
that occur on Bike Paths .
Maintaining the Bike Path , the lights , the
landscaping , the fences , the walls all become low - priority .
( see Caution for the Arroyo Bike Path )
Bike paths are
considered recreational paths , not transportation paths .
( Now this
explains why they lead to nowhere . )
California Government Code Section 831.4 .
Maintenance : Bike paths need special funding to be maintained .
Maintenance on Bike Paths includes illumination , removal of debris
( tree branches , trash , broken glass , etc. ) , fixing of fallen , bent or
cut fencing that stick out , repaving of broken pavement , removing of
obstruction , like shopping carts , dumped items or car parts that have
been left there ( insert photo of LA River when car drove into path ) ,
tree and bush trimmings , etc .
If there is no funding , you are left
literally in the dark .
Of course , since the funding for Bike Path maintenance is in short
supply , it makes sense why the LADOT does n’t want to be liable to
maintain it .
I ’m starting to make a connection here .
Destination :
In LA , the Bike Paths are usually built where there
is right - of - way , not where they belong .
This means that cyclists wo n’t
find Bike
Paths that take them to employment centers , schools ,
entertainment opportunities , museums , shopping centers , city centers ,
or any of the other places that people in cars , on buses , on trains and
on foot go to on a daily basis .
Do n’t cyclists have places to go to ?
If
so , why do n’t Bike Paths go there ?
Design :
In LA the Bike Paths are not " integrated " with traffic ,
meaning that there are no triggers for traffic lights .
One must become
a pedestrian to push the crossing button .
Oftentimes , one has to
dismount when leaving the path to become a pedestrian to then mount the
bike again to get back into regular vehicular traffic .
( What would
drivers say if they would have to get out of their cars when exiting
the freeway , push the car all the way to the end of the off ramp only
to then get back into the car , start it up and slowly turn into the
urban traffic flow . )
The curb cuts are diagonal at
intersections , so that when one rolls off the path into the crossing ,
the front tire is actually facing into right turning traffic and of
course pedestrians , people pushing strollers , and wheelchair users are
competing for the same space in both direction , creating a jam at the
small curb cut right at the corner of the sidewalk where most accidents
happen with motor vehicle drivers .

Bike Paths such as the Chandler Bike Path sit in the middle of vast
open space with no restrictions but the problem is that they squeeze
traffic moving in both directions into a small area , often with tragic
results .
Two League of American Bicyclist ( LAB ) cycling instructors were riding on the Chandler Bike Path , only to encounter a roller blader coming
the other direction .
The collision left both cyclists with broken arms .

The Chandler Bike Path , even though it ’s open to the environment , is
still segregated from the neighborhood by landscaping and gates to the
south side development .
One ca n’t enter the path from the neighborhood
without having to carry their bike over the high curb and landscaping
unless they live at the major intersections .
still segregated from the neighborhood by landscaping and gates to the south side development .
One ca n’t enter the path from the neighborhood without having to carry their bike over the high curb and landscaping unless they live at the major intersections .
Bike Paths , by design , are popular with families who are encouraging
small children to ride .
This creates a dangerous environment where the
youngest and most vulnerable are at odds with cyclists who are riding
fast to get to a destination .
In other words , the separated benefits
are also the liabilities .
Of course , the faster cyclists could slow
down but now it simply makes sense for them to ride on the street .
Which is my point .
Cyclists who want to get somewhere are better off
riding in the street .
Closures : Secluded Bike Paths are often closed ,
usually for reasons that are related to being …secluded .
The Arroyo
Seco Bike
Path is in the river channel , it gets closed when it rains .
The Ballona Creek Bike Path gets closed because of the crime .
The Sepulveda Bike Path is built in a flood zone .
Bike Paths will never be transportation solutions if they are closed without warning and without options for those who
use them .
Again , Los Angeles builds Bike Paths where they fit , not
where they are needed .
Cost : The 1.8 - mile stretch of the San Fernando Road Bike Path ,
from Roxford to Hubbard streets cost $ 4.2 million compared to bike
lanes that cost approximately $ 5,000 to $ 50,000 per mile ( depending on
the condition of the pavement , the need to remove and repaint the lane
lines , the need to adjust signalization , and other factors ) .
This means
that $ 4.2 million could cover between 84 to 840 miles of bike lanes in
Los Angeles .
The City of LA ’s current Draft Bike Plan proposes Bike
Lanes costing $ 4,202,687 and Bike Paths costing $ 152,303,135 !
Every
dollar spent on a Bike Path is a dollar that the city of Los Angeles
does not have to spend on a Bike Boulevard or a Bike Lane .
Every dollar spent on a Bike Path is a dollar not spent on encouragement and education and enforcement .
Studies prove my point :
Many studies have been done in Holland ,
Germany , Denmark and even in the US , that suggest that segregating
cyclists actually increases accident rates .
A 1990 research found that " crash risk " for crossing the intersection on a set - back path are up to 11.9 times higher than when biking in a bike lane .
Here is an excerpt from Wiki about Bike Paths and accidents :
the city ’s 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) of cycle paths .
The Berlin police
and Senate conducted studies which led to a
In Berlin 10 % of the roads have cycle paths , but these produce 75 % of
fatalities and serious injuries among cyclists .
In the English town of
Milton Keynes it has been shown that cyclists using the off - road Milton
Keynes redway system have on a per-journey basis a significantly higher
rate of fatal car - bicycle collisions ( significantly higher rate of
fatal car - bicycle collisions ) than cyclists on ordinary roads .
Cycle
lanes and bike lanes are less dangerous than cycle paths in urban
situations but even well - implemented examples have been associated with
10 % increases in casualty rates .
In Helsinki , research has shown that cyclists are safer cycling on roads with traffic than when usingthe city ’s 800 kilometres ( 500 mi ) of cycle paths .
The Berlin policeand Senate conducted studies which led to a similar conclusion in the 1980s .
In Berlin 10 % of the roads have cycle paths , but these produce 75 % offatalities and serious injuries among cyclists .
In the English town ofMilton Keynes it has been shown that cyclists using the off - road MiltonKeynes redway system have on a per-journey basis a significantly higherrate of fatal car - bicycle collisions ( significantly higher rate offatal car - bicycle collisions ) than cyclists on ordinary roads .
Cyclelanes and bike lanes are less dangerous than cycle paths in urbansituations but even well - implemented examples have been associated with10 % increases in casualty rates .
When I hear some of our leadership talk of Berlin and how great the
European bike facilities work , it makes me angry because our leadership
should do some research before they make any blind statements .
Just
because they went on a bike ride during their vacation , it does n’t mean
they do n’t have to do the research before they spend millions of our
dollars on facilities that are unsafe , segregated , lead to nowhere and
end up being closed down .
It is easy to do some research online , in any
language , to find out what works and what does n’t .
I do n’t expect the average commuter to do this research but I want them
to know what they are lobbying for and what their risks are .
We need to
be able to differentiate between actual and perceived safety .
A recent Copenhagen study
found that their newly built bike paths and bike lanes had negative
effects on road safety .
Segregation has never worked !
Not in countries ( I come from a communist
country , so I know that segregation does n’t work ) , not in people
( women , people of color , sex and religion stood up and are still
standing up against being segregated and being treated differently not
equally ) and not in our freedom to move about .
Before
it engages in developing recreational pursuits , the City of Los Angeles
needs to commit to supporting all cyclists on the Streets of LA !
All eyes in the world should be on the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference as we wait with a stuttering heartbeat to learn about the policies that will guide humanity through the next great evolutionary bottleneck .
The topic I will be keeping an eye on is overpopulation .
Overpopulation is the greatest ethical problem we face as a species as we begin to recognise our pivotal impact on the planet and start to actually do something about carbon emissions , pollution and poverty .
If there were n’t so many of us , our levels of consumption would be reduced , our effluent would be minimised and our cultural habits would be manageable .
But how do we go about ethically addressing the issue of population growth ?
I find it hard to condone China ‘s one - child policy , but could the rest of the world be owing carbon credits to China in light of new research which shows that for every $ 7 spent of family planning we can reduce more than one tonne of CO2 emissions ?
One thing is clear , reducing the world ’s population is a necessity but it is an issue that can only be approached through education not enforcement .
A decade of lost opportunities to increase contraceptive prevalence was noted as recently as the 1980s ( Diczfalusy , 1991 ) .
It is clear that now , more than ever , widespread distribution of family planning and contraceptive technology is crucial to our future on this planet .
To what degree is our concern about climate change altruistic ?
I do not believe that we are concerned about the health of our planet as much as we are concerned about our existence on it .
At the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference , are we discussing what changes need to be made or merely what changes we are prepared to make ?
And if so , how effective will such egocentric , ethnocentric and anthropomorphic changes be ?
There are a few things I would like to know about the Copenhagen Climate Change Summit .
Did the attendees travel by plane or did they sail the northerly trade - winds to Denmark ?
Will the menu be meat free ?
Are they travelling by car from their hotels to the conference ?
Or will they choose public transport ?
I ’m not sure if meat , cars and planes are things that many people are willing to go without !
Slipping on a condom , however , might just be the barrier between our greed and our hypocrisy .
During the UN conference , there will need to be unbiased decisions about what measures we need to go to , which cultural habits will be sustainable and what solutions we can implement in order to reduce our impact on the ecology of our world .
During a recent conference at UCLA , it was forecast that by the end of 2009 there will have been 78 million more births than deaths with over 95 % of this growth coming from low - income countries .
Coupled with the estimations that there are over 80 million unintended pregnancies every year , we can deduce that if we were to hypothetically reduce unintended pregnancies then supposedly population growth would be kept in check .
78 million more births than deaths – 80 million unintended pregnancies overted = negative birth rate of 2million
It is known that access to contraception , safe abortion and family planning decreases family size .
It is also known that education , particularly of women , makes an important contribution to fertility decline .
With the spread of access to internet resources growing , welfare groups might just have found their medium of communication for free education .
The far - reaching advances in technology and communication is changing how millions of people in the developing world interact ( Friedman 2005 ; de Blij 2009 ) .
With internet access even found in refugee camps around the world , free education has for the first time the potential to be a realistic proposition .
Learning resources translated , animated and made available through the internet may turn out to be a primary access point for a significant proportion of the one billion young people aged 15 to 24 who live with limited educational and employment opportunities .
Al Gore is one of the most recent on the international stage to draw the conclusion that Global warming is the result of human activities ( Gore , 2006 ) .
Perhaps he had already come to the conclusion that population growth only exacerbates the problem when in 1999 he opposed South Africa ’s Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment
Act aimed at providing low - cost AIDS therapy drugs to a population where 22 per cent of sexually active adults were infected ( Wadman 1999 ) .
Western pharmaceutical companies have displayed little interest in producing drugs for the developing world , not only because there are little profits to be made , but also because they would not make as much profit in developed countries if customers realized that these drugs can be produced and sold at cheaper prices .
Maybe Al Gore might not see a problem with this mentality when it comes to AIDS medication , but if those of us in developed nations would like to hold on to our natural luxuries a little longer then perhaps we should consider the cheap distribution of steroidal contraceptives .
It has been found to be more profitable for the big pharmaceutical companies of the Western world to keep all steroidal contraceptives available only through medical prescription .
There is absolutely no medical justification for this cautionary action ( Trussel et al. 1994 ) but covertly it enables the pharmaceutical companies to exploit doctors as their unpaid sales force , whilst at the same time maintaining a relatively high price for a product that is off patent , and could be made for next to nothing .
This medicalisation of contraception denies access to those who need it most – impecunious , uninformed and reticent teenagers all over the world who are reluctant to reveal their nascent sexuality in potentially volatile and seemingly un-navigated social and religious settings .
Western pharmaceutical corporations with their profit - driven objectives ( Angell 2004 ) are not offering solutions .
Donor agencies , however , can turn to the pharmaceutical companies of the developing world , such as those in China , India , Indonesia and Thailand .
Allow me to use Brazil as a case - study of population growth in the developing world .
Brazil is one country where the morning - after pill can be obtained over - the - counter for between five and ten dollars .
Unfortunately , the number of people living on less than a dollar a day puts the pill out of reach of a large proportion of the population .
Brazil is a country of stark contrasts between poverty and affluence , beauty and pollution , shantytowns and skyscrapers .
The richest 10 percent of Brazilians own two - thirds of all the land and control more than half of Brazil ’s wealth ( Knapp 2002 ) .
It is believed that the poorest one - fifth of Brazilians , over 34 million people , live in the most wretched conditions prevailing anywhere on Earth , even including the megacities of Africa and Asia ( de Blij 2009 ) .
The marginal are not the masses living in poverty , but the minority privileged .
In the developing world , Brazil is considered to provide insights into the likely future of urbanization elsewhere ( de Blij 2009:188 ) .
With widespread corruption , crime and contagions , what kind of bleak forecast does this suggest for other nations ?
In terms of carbon footprints , Brazil ’s carbon dioxide emissions already account for well over a third of South America ’s emissions ( Boden et al. 2009 ) .
Such statistics beg the question , what will happen when the consumption patterns of highly urbanized societies become global ?
The urban population is increasing much faster in developing countries than in the more - developed regions with the world ’s total urban population expected to reach 5.1 billion by 2025 .
The City of Rio de Janeiro is SEVEN TIMES LARGER than it was in 1900 and the City of Salvador da Bahia is FOURTEEN TIMES LARGER than it was in 1900 .
Over the last 30 years , the population of the State of Bahia in Brazil has grown by over 50 % , while the population of the state ’s capital , the city of Salvador , has grown by almost 100 % .
Since the 1980s , urban migration to regional capitals like Salvador has increased .
This shift in internal migration patterns places enormous demands on infrastructure and has been accompanied by a growth of pollution , poverty and epidemics .
Dengue Fever , for example , was first recognised in Brazil in 1981 ( Nogueira et al. 2002 ) with successive outbreaks and almost three million recorded cases in less than a twenty - year period ( Teixeira et al. 2002 ) .
Disease and poverty , however , have done little to stop the overall population growth in Brazil .
With the unmet need for contraception in low income countries calculated to increase to 722 million in 2015 ( Potts et al. 2009 ) , it is time for us to take action .
Why should we be concerned about population growth in developing countries who contribute the least to the pollution associated with climate change ?
It is because these countries will be the worst affected by the inevitable consequences of global warming and unpredictable weather patterns .
With rising sea levels , escalating fresh water shortages and the increasing spread of epidemics and contagious diseases , there is no doubt that resources among the world ’s poorest communities will be limited the most .
However , how can we expect the people of the developing world to learn from our mistakes , if we ourselves are not demonstrating the lessons learnt ?
2000 years ago the world population was less than 300 million .
By the time of the voyages of Columbus to America , some 1500 years later , the population doubled to approximately 600 million ( Diczfalusy 1991 ) .
Nobel laureate , Paul Crutzen , recently proposed that in the latter half of the 18th century the world could be said to have entered a new geological epoch which we should call the Anthropocene since that was when human activities spurred on by the Industrial Revolution , began to dominate all the ecosystems on earth ( Crutzen & Stoermer 2000 ) .
It was only after the industrial and agricultural revolutions that the world population reached 1 billion , doubling by 1927 to 2 billion , and then taking only 50 years to double again ( Diczfalusy 1991 ) .
In the last 100 years alone , the world population has quadrupled .
At the dawn of the Anthropocene , the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus , a clergyman , mathematician and Fellow of Jesus College , published An Essay on the Principle of Population , As It Affects the Future Improvement of Society ( June , 1798 ) .
Malthus calculated that human populations left unchecked would increase geometrically , whereas the ability of the Earth to provide subsistence for this growing population would only increase arithmetically .
He concluded that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man .
Natural laws imply a strong and constantly operating check on population .
In Malthus ’ view , the difficulty of subsistence would be continuously imposed upon a large majority of the human population who would always suffer from deprivation of the necessities of life .
Inspired by the French Revolution , many of Malthus ’ contemporaries were optimistic about the future and viciously attacked Malthus ’ bleak predictions .
They saw humankind progressing ever upwards to a world of universal abundance , peace and prosperity , where all would be equal in health , wealth and happiness ( Potts & Short 1999:286 ) .
The social reformers of the day , like Karl Marx , Frederick Engels and Samuel Coleridge could not accept the idea that the poor might stay with us ( Short 1998 ) .
Robert Southey , the author of the detailed History of Brazil ( 1810 - 1819 ) , violently condemned Malthus ’ theorem .
“ Mr Malthus is cast in his action against God Almighty , ” he remarked , “ I will gibbet him in a pamphlet , and draw and quarter him ” ( Poynter 1969:168 ) .
In the face of disbelief and criticism , subsequent events have debunked the utopian fantasies of Malthus ’ critics and verified his dismal premonition about the difficulty of subsistence .
Sadly , Malthus ’ dystopian vision prevailed .
The economist John Maynard Keynes described Malthus ’ essay as “ a work of youthful genius ” ( O’ Donnell 2006:399 ) .
However , the highest praise for Malthus ’ work came from Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace , who independently stated that Malthus ’ essay was one of the most influential books that either of them had ever read , since it provided the key to understanding how the survival of the fittest could lead to natural selection , and ultimately the origin of new species ( Potts & Short 1999:286 ) .
The exponential growth in population is contrary to Malthus ’ forebodings .
He thought that late marriage , high levels of infant and childhood mortality , wars , abortion , infanticide , plague , pestilence and famine would act as preventive and positive checks on further population growth .
Malthus failed to anticipate advances in agricultural technology , the drop in infant mortality and the rise in life expectancy .
However , he was also unaware of pesticides , detergents , solvents , bioaccumulation , hormone disruptors , developmental toxicants , carcinogens , acid rain , ozone problems and fossil fuel emissions .
Global warming is just one among many threats to sustaining human life , wildlife and the natural environment ( Potts , Pebley & Spiedel 2009 ) .
In some places , we are even turning our agriculture into a non-renewable resource ( Diamond 2005 ) .
Today , when we consider the relationship between population growth and the physical environment , demography has advanced little beyond Malthusian arithmetic ( Hogan 1992 ) .
In aligning our cultural habits with our ecological boundaries , we have done little to take control and sequester human population growth .
Historically , our track record at reacting to impending peril is fairly poor .
Humans have lived in zones prone to natural disaster for centuries , and in full awareness of the inevitable dangers .
Flood plains , volcanic islands , fault lines , hurricane regions and tornado areas have been and still are home to humans who have decided that the short - term benefits outweigh a catastrophic risk that has struck somewhere in history and will strike again somewhere in the future .
History has shown that these threats have been misjudged by a species that miscalculates the profits and perils of place .
Our brains have proven ill - equipped to respond to dangers that require substantial forethought .
However , today , as the entire earth is fast becoming the site of imminent catastrophe , we are beginning to demonstrate the signs of overcoming our neurological shortcomings .
The tools of culture that are giving us certain premonitions of the future are also giving us the inspiration to shape our fate .
Notably , in the developed world , we are beginning to see the burgeonings of an expanded consciousness where people are becoming aware of peripheral issues and making them central to their lives in very active and dynamic ways .
If we accept the assumption that “ Larger populations make innovation more likely ” ( Bloom et al. 2009 ) , then we can hope that human cultures will be able to adapt quickly to the radical technological solutions we will have to adopt .
As a short term solution to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions , James Lovelock has recommended that there should be an immediate switch from coal energy to nuclear energy ( Lovelock 2006 ) .
Certainly the French have offered us a model where electricity costs to households running on nuclear energy have been 30 to 40 % lower than those of other European countries ( Mallet & Lévêque 2009 ) .
With UN predictions that the human population will increase to between 8 billion to 10.5 billion in 2050 , the conversion to nuclear power or renewable energy is one measure among many that will have to be given serious consideration and swift implementation in order to reduce carbon emissions .
A fatal flaw in economic activity was foreseen as far back as the 18th century by the pioneer Scottish economist Adam Smith who argued that the economic behavior was motivated by self - interest ( Ashraf et al. 2005 ) .
In The Wealth of Nations ( 1776 ) he wrote that :
“ The desire for food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of the human stomach ; but the desire for the conveniences and ornaments of building , dress , equipage and household furniture seem to know no limit or certain boundary . ”
( Smith quoted by Paganelli 2009:85 )
Human culture empowers our Selfish Genes and no negative feedback controls have been identified ( Short , 2009 ) .
The exploitation of the world ’s resources through mining , deforestation , and the plundering of our oceans , is testament to the greed that Smith labelled as boundless and limitless .
The technology that runs on renewable energy is already available .
However , it is demoralizing that superpower petrol and mining companies are delaying the production and distribution of these technologies so that they can exhaust one resource before they turn to the next , thus keeping prices high during the sale seasons of both .
It is abundantly clear , our productivist civilization and rampant consumerism neglects the fragile homeostatic balance between cultural behaviours and delicate ecological constraints .
Paul Ehrlich ( 1968 ; 2008 ) has argued for several decades that population pressure on natural resources and the environment is a contemporary issue that has been ignored by policy makers ( Bloom et al. 2009 ) .
His often exaggerated arguments have left doubts , but for others it has become clear that “ maintaining the population size does not seem to be a valid aim of population policy ” ( Bijak et al. 2005:27 ) .
If we do avoid a potential global disaster by reducing population size , strict socio- economic measures will have to be put in place to avert the negative economic effects of population and labour force ageing .
In this scenario , policy makers will need to pay attention to the experience of countries like Japan where the fertility rate is around 1.3 children per woman ( Clark et al. 2009 ) .
The projections of Bijak et al. ( 2005 ) for 27 European countries from 2002 to 2052 , “ show that the long - term consequences of demographic change should be treated by social policy - makers and politicians whose temporal perspective exceeds the nearest election , with due attention ” ( Bijak et al. 2005:28 ) .
The first warnings of cataclysm predicted over 200 years ago give the verisimilitude of having taken too long to reach the public sphere .
Only the future can tell if the measures we are taking will have been too little too late .
If one was to bet on how much should be done , then in the spirit of a Pascal Wager , it is better to bet on the reality of overpopulation , urbanisation and consummation , exacerbating carbon dioxide emissions .
The world ’s population was one billion when Malthus made his gloomy predictions .
Today , it has increased to 6.8 billion .
Malthus could not have predicted that it would be our own effluent , the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , which might be the ultimate check to population growth .
The time - honoured phrase “ The sky is the limit ” has taken on a sinister new meaning ( Short , 2009 ) .
In new and imaginative ways , it is time for us to realise our humanity .
Taking the message home to my fellow Australians , in Jared Diamond ‘s book Collapse I recall reading that at current levels of production in Australia , agriculture is a less renewable resource than the mining industry .
That ’s a scary forecast !
Diamond even goes so far as to state that the world ’s driest continent can only sustainably support 8 million people with its own natural produce .
With politicians hoping to expand our population to 35 million ( for current levels visit the Australian Bureau of statistics ) , perhaps we need to seriously reconsider the relationship between economics and the environment .
Our economy empowers our greed exponentially , but the environment has limits .
The biggest carbon footprint you can leave is a child , so Make every birth a wanted birth .

Zeroing in on a perception that Ms. Gillibrand too readily defers to Senate leaders , especially Senator Charles E. Schumer , he added : “ We have a fundamental difference on independence .
We have a difference on the level , the kind and the stature of advocacy New Yorkers deserve .
And we have some honest differences on issues . ”
He blasted her support for the proposed health care overhaul , which is expected to cost New York an extra $ 1 billion a year , and for opposing the taxpayer bailout of the financial industry .
“ It was a mistake , ” he said , noting that most Wall Street firms had already paid back the money .
“ How can you be against ensuring that the lifeblood of your city and of your state survives ? ”
Asked to grade her performance in the Senate , he said : “ It would certainly be hard to give a grade that would be a glowing one . ”
Mr. Ford , however , acknowledged that he gave Ms. Gillibrand a $ 1,000 campaign contribution shortly after her appointment , saying he had done so at the request of a friend .
“ She had only been a senator for two days , ” he added .
After Mr. Ford , a five - term Tennessee congressman , arrived in New York , he took a job as a vice chairman at Merrill Lynch ( now Bank of America ) .
But he kept a toe in politics , becoming a commentator on Fox and then NBC , which features him several days a week on programs like MSNBC ’s “ Morning Joe . ”
Speaking from a conference room at New York University , where he is a teacher , Mr. Ford , 39 , expressed enthusiasm about his new hometown , though he described a life quite different than most New Yorkers .
On many days , he is driven to an NBC television studio in a chauffeured car .
He and his wife , Emily , a 29 - year - old fashion executive , live a few blocks from the Lexington Avenue subway line in the Flatiron district .
But Mr. Ford said he takes the subway only occasionally in the winter , to avoid the cold when he cannot hail a cab .
Tara C. sent in this video about why big blockbuster video games have n’t tended to appeal to women , and what might need to change to make the ( non-casual ? ) gaming world more interesting to women in general :
Apparently the creators of this trailer for Record of Agarest War , sent in by Goku S. , had n’t seen the video ( NSFW ) :
Nor , presumably , did the creator of the Pocket Girlfriend iPhone app , sent in by Suzanne B. :
You ’ll be excited to know that she ’s real !
Pocket Girlfriend moves , she ’s interactive , and most importantly she ’s real .
YES SHE’S REAL !!!!
She ’s not some 3D rendered mannequin .
Seriously , why would you want to buy an application of a dancing mannequin ?
Looks like Yahoo did n’t get the message either when it hired lap dancers to attend an event to recruit developers to build things for Yahoo.com , and then posted images of the dancers on the Yahoo Developer Network blog :
Yahoo later apologized .
[ And for the record , yes , I realize these are just some examples and do n’t represent the entire gaming community , especially the Yahoo thing .
That ’s true of anything we post–they ’re specific examples that we try to fit into a larger context . ]
On a related tech - and - gender note , Brigid told us that Wired magazine recently described a study that suggested the stereotype of computer scientists as “ unwashed nerds ” may be off - putting to women and discourage them from going into computer programming :
Cheryan and colleagues tested this idea by alternately decorating a computer science classroom with objects that earlier surveys pegged as stereotypically geeky —
Star Trek posters , videogames and comic books — or with objects that the surveys found to be neutral — coffee mugs , plants and art posters .
Thirty - nine college students spent a few minutes in the room , then filled out a questionnaire on their attitudes toward computer science .
Women who spent time in the geeky room reported less interest in computer science than women who saw the neutral room .
For male students , however , the room ’s décor made no difference .
Make of that what you will .
UPDATE : Comments closed .
Sorry , but it was turning into a big fight that was n’t constructive .
UPDATE 2 : Upon request that I rethink closing comments , I ’ve cleaned out some problematic ones and am reopening the comment thread .
Please remember–no personal attacks or insult wars .
Play relatively nice .

Stuart Isett for The New York Times
The choice the country faces in health - care reform is a stark one with profound ramifications :
What process will best deliver affordable quality health - care to all Americans , a government - driven or market - driven one ?
It 's not unusual for political and legislative battles in the nation 's capital to be sharply partisan .
But even by Washington standards , the health - care debate has been exceptionally contentious and polarizing .
The bills that have passed in the House and the Senate are supported almost exclusively by Democrats , and Congressional Republicans are nearly unanimous in the view that these bills merit their total and unyielding opposition ( so far , only one House Republican has voted for the Democratic proposals ) .
Both sides are waging the fight with such an extreme take - no - prisoners attitude that even long - time Washington observers have been taken aback by the intensity of the struggle .

Health care
All of this political fighting can be disconcerting to average citizens .
Why , on an issue that is plainly so important , can't our nation 's elected leaders check their politics at the door and work out an agreement that elicits broad - based support instead of war - room like campaigns to prevail over their opponents ?
The answer is that the disagreement over what must be done to improve American health - care is profound and largely irreconcilable .
This is n't your usual , run - of - the - mill political fight .
The two sides hold diametrically opposed views that simply do not easily allow for compromise .
Moreover , the outcome of the battle will be highly consequential , not just for our system of financing and delivering health - care , but also for our economy and democratic processes .
In short , the stakes are very , very high , and both sides know it .
Many people suppose that the heart of the disagreement is over whether or not to expand coverage to more people .
It is , of course , a primary objective of the Democratic sponsors of the current initiative to ensure that every American , or nearly so , is enrolled in some kind of health insurance plan on a continuous basis .
But Republicans are not opposed to expanding coverage to the uninsured .
In 2008 , presidential candidate John McCain proposed a plan which would have provided to every American household a tax credit which could only be used to purchase a health insurance policy .
It was , in a very real sense , a " universal coverage " plan in that it sought to ensure that every American would have the financial wherewithal , provided by the federal government , to acquire some level of health insurance protection .
The issue , then , is not over expanding coverage to all .
No , the real sticking point between the two sides is really about allocating resources in the health - care sector .
Both sides agree that the status quo is unsustainable , largely because costs are rising much more rapidly than wages or governmental revenues .
The crucial question is what to do about the problem .
Put differently , the question health - care reform advocates must answer is this : what process will be put in place to bring about continual improvement in the productivity and quality of patient care ?
That might strike some as something of a technical question , not one of fundamental importance .
But , in reality , it 's just another way of saying that resources are scarce and must be allocated in some fashion .
The only way to slow rising costs without lowering the quality of care provided is to improve the efficiency of the interactions between doctors and hospitals and those they care for .
The question before policymakers is what is most likely to lead to better care at less cost .
The Obama administration believes a governmental process is the answer .
There are a series of provisions in the House and Senate bills which try to use the leverage of Medicare payment policy to force doctors and hospitals to change how they practice medicine .
For instance , there are penalties for hospitals that have too many of their patients readmitted for care , and for physicians who are outliers in terms of how many services they render for certain diagnoses .
Other reforms are introduced as pilot programs that might be expanded later .
In addition , the Senate bill picks up on the idea pushed by the administration to set up an independent Medicare commission which would make ongoing recommendations for cost- cutting in the program through provider - payment reforms .
Congress could not reject the commission 's proposals without substituting ideas that achieve similar levels of savings , but the commission could n't make any recommendations that alter any aspect of the program other than payment policies for providers of services .
Some of these reforms might actually work and marginally improve matters from the status quo .
But would they fundamentally change Medicare , much less the rest of American health care ?
No , they would n't .
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) projects that relatively small savings will result from the Medicare commission idea , and even smaller amounts will be saved by the other reforms touted by the administration .
In ten years ' time , even if all of the ideas were fully implemented , Medicare and the rest of American health - care would look and operate largely as it does today , which is to say as a fee - for - service insurance model that rewards volume and fragmentation , not integration and efficiency .
Adding tens of millions of people to an unreformed system will only exacerbate rising costs , putting even more pressure on the federal budget as well as household incomes .
Proponents of a governmental process have an unbounded confidence in the ability of the federal government to centrally plan and control an extremely complex sector of the American economy .
But there is nearly a half century of experience with the Medicare program indicating that this confidence is entirely misplaced .
There have been countless efforts over the years to measure quality and set payments in the Medicare program accordingly to encourage patients to see the doctors and go to the hospitals that are the most efficient and provide the best care .
Most of the ideas have been tested in demonstration programs , or floated as legislative initiatives .
But virtually none of them have gone anywhere .
Why ?
The answer is simple : Politicians are incapable of building what amounts to a government - administered " preferred provider network . "
They simply can't pick one hospital over another , or one physician practice over another , because that implies that some physicians or hospitals in their district are inferior .
And that 's just not something an elected official ever wants to do .
So , instead , they prefer to hit spending targets with across - the - board payment - rate reductions which treat all licensed providers equally .
Every hospital , doctor , and other service provider gets cut the same , without regard to any measure of how well or badly they treat patients .
That 's been the history of the Medicare program , and , in fact , that 's how the current Congress plans to achieve most of the $ 500 billion in Medicare savings in the health - care bills .
But these kinds of arbitrary price controls are also very dangerous for the quality of American medicine .
They drive out willing suppliers of services , after which the only way to balance supply and demand is with waiting lists and rationing of care .
That 's why so many other countries have months - long waits for expensive care .
They control costs by artificially holding down prices with government regulation .
And they pay the price " off - budget " by making their citizens wait for care they would rather access much more quickly .
That 's the big danger of the health - care bills being drafted in Congress .
They would put the federal government in the cost - control driver 's seat , and all experience indicates that will lead , in time , to arbitrary price setting and rationing .
There is an alternative to this kind of governmental process .
It involves building a real marketplace , one where cost - conscious consumers choose between competing insurers and delivery systems based on price and quality .
The government can and should play an important oversight role in such a reformed system .
But the difficult organizational changes and innovations necessary to provide better care at lower cost would come from those delivering the services , not Congress , or the Department of Health and Human Services , or even an independent commission .
The new Medicare prescription drug benefit was constructed just this way when it was enacted in 2003 .
Beneficiaries get a fixed dollar entitlement that they can use to buy coverage from a number of different competing plans .
The insurers understand that they have to keep costs down to attract price - sensitive enrollees .
And the government has no role in setting premiums or drug prices .
And how is it working ?
Costs have come in forty percent below original expectations .
Opponents of a market - based reform argue that it is impossible to reconcile price - based allocation of health services with equity .
But that is not true .
In the Medicare drug program , low - income seniors get additional help to pay for their prescriptions through a special funding stream .
And all indications are that poor seniors are getting what they need from the program .
The country faces a choice here .
We can choose to rely entirely on the federal government to allocate resources in the health - care sector , or we can choose to let consumers and suppliers make decisions in a decentralized marketplace with the government providing oversight and enforcing consumer protections .
There is an irreversible aspect to this decision , whenever it is made , which perhaps explains why it has been delayed so long in our political processes .
Once we finally decide , definitively , to head down one of these paths , it will be very difficult to change course later and go the other way .
Which is why all concerned are bringing to the current fight in Congress every resource they can muster to prevail .
Modern Family is more than just a very funny show .
It also takes a step toward rescuing the sitcom family from the mean - spirited vein it has been stuck in for more than a decade .
Women get all kinds of advice from magazines from how to dress to how to please a man in the bedroom , and even what to cook for us .
And while it ’s not all bad ( with hotties like Kristen Bell and Jessica Alba on the cover ) these mags are lacking much needed male insights .
For example , we ’re actually not that interested in your hair and we definitely do n’t care about your shoes .
Do n’t get us wrong , we love the heels … we just do n’t see why you need so many pairs that quite frankly , to us look the same .
But if Women ’s magazines were actually written by men , there would n’t be so much confusion about what we want .
Here are some article titles , written by men that get straight to the point .

UPDATE 2 : Some relief for victims of KaiEn English fiasco as ChinesePod CEO downplays Ken Carroll ’s role
UPDATE : Another day , another disgruntled KaiEn English teacher
KaiEn English , one of the oldest English teaching institutions in the city went belly up very suddenly earlier this week , stranding hundreds of students and staff just before the holidays .
The founders have all disappeared out of the country , the teachers have n’t been paid in two months , the Chinese staff probably for even more … and reimbursements for tuition fees ?
Do n’t count on it .
But how did a school with a 13 year history in Shanghai just go up in smoke ?
According to one tipster ( one of the teachers ) , there had been signs of trouble over the last eight months .
The teacher is now owed around 40,000 RMB in wages .
He admits that he probably should have taken heed of all the warnings ( things got so bad at one point that there was a heated teacher “ uprising ” ) and left before the paychecks stopped coming in , but “ when you believe in the company and the people that you work with , and that between you things can only get better if you work hard enough …
Well , I guess that sometimes in life you ’re wrong . ”
Sounds like the tenets of any abusive relationship .
An outline of the last couple of months at KaiEn :
The first that those within the company knew of the financial difficulties was when salary payments were postponed by fifteen days ( from the 23rd of each month , working one week in hand , to the 15th of the next month , effectively working three weeks in hand ) .
Although this was a difficulty at the time , for the majority of teachers this was not a huge issue .
However , at the meeting that this suggestion was proposed , the owner was recorded as saying , “ if teachers ca n’t learn how to budget , fuck them . ”
This should have really been the first warning sign to get out … but people being people , they trusted that a new Managing Director who joined the company at this time could help alleviate the problems and guide the company to a long and prosperous future .
Fast forward till around April ’09 … Salary payments have been delayed unexpectedly , with a note from HR saying that this is a temporary problem and will not happen again .
Payments are made around 4 days later .
May ’09 … Same thing again , but this time payment is around 8 days later .
June ’09 … guess what !
salary payments delayed , and travel reimbursements become lost in the system .
Cutting a long story short ( because it gets a little repetitive saying the same thing happens month after month ) …
November 15th , all payments come through on time ( with the exception of travel reimbursements and bonuses ) .
This comes after a near staff uprising the previous month at HQ which lasts until 2 am .
During this uprising , it becomes clear that only foreign teachers have been getting paid ( late ) .
Local staff , including teachers , Course Consultants and administrative staff have not been paid for several months , causing extreme difficulties for those involved .
From Nov. 15th , staff are assured that new investors have been found by the owners in Ireland , and funds are on the way for the future to ensure the continued viability of the business .
Staff are somewhat reassured , although doubts remain .
Still … people be people …
Monday .
I go to the office to try and get reimbursement for my new Residents Permit .
Look in the office , and nobody is there .
Call HR and am told that they are now scared to come to the office as , “ gangsters came in last Friday looking for money , and the owners have been missing for the last fifteen days ” .
Worry .
Tuesday – payday .
No money forthcoming , realise everything has gone tits up .
Worry more .
Get calls from students , colleagues and friends saying my company is on TV .
Founder Brian McCloskey is now suspected to be in Ireland .
Co-founder Ken Carroll allegedly flew to Taiwan a couple of weeks ago ( we ’ve emailed him to try to get his side of the story – if it ever comes ) .
Partner Steve Williams has also ran off , we hear , back to England .
All three were not only involved in Kaien , but also Praxis Language and ChinesePod – who knows what will happen to those companies now that a big chunk of their management team has disappeared .
In the meantime , let it be a warning .
As another former - Kaien employee put it , this “ should be a good case to show foreigners how little protection they have from shitty employers , and how they need to be proactive in protecting themselves . ”
On last night ’s The Late Show with David Letterman , the “ chicken - hearted and gutless ” ( though he wo n’t speak for Conan O’Brien ) host ripped on NBC executive Dick Ebersol , suggesting he focus on picking out sweaters for Olympics anchor Bob Costas instead of miring himself in NBC ’s late - night disaster .
Letterman ’s not going to stop mocking Leno , either .
“ I ’m telling jokes and making fun of Jay Leno relentlessly , mercilessly , simply for one reason : I ’m really enjoying it . ”
[ CROWD APPLAUDS WILDLY . ]
“ It ’s just fun ! ”
AR - 15 Lower Receiver
The AR - 15 lower receiver was the first project that I started .
I got the idea when I saw the lower receiver forging that Pvt. Ryan at Roderus Custom Gunworks was working on .
He started with a raw forging , which is basically a block of aluminum , but in the shape of lower receiver .
He done a great job of showing all the details of his work .
That got me thinking that I could do the same thing with CNC ( Computerized Numerical Control ) equipment .
But instead of starting with a forging , I thought I wanted more of a challenge so I started with a block ( billet ) of aluminum .
After I found the solid model file for the AR - 15 lower receiver , I knew what I wanted to do could be done .
I spent many hours coming up with a game plan of how I was going to machine the lower receiver .
After I had my game plan together , I started programming the lower receiver using a type of computer software called CAM ( Computer Aided Machining ) .
CAM is often used along with CAD ( Computer Aided Design ) and this process is called CAD / CAM .
Since I already had the solid model of the lower receiver ( the CAD part ) , all that was left was the CAM .
After I programmed all the tool paths that I wanted the CNC machine to make , I sent the program out to the machining center .
I cut the 5x2 billets of aluminum , and I was almost ready to start doing some cutting .
Here is what the lower receiver looked like at the start of the 1st operation ...
Here you can see the 1/2 " carbide ball nose endmill roughing the profile .
You can tell that it 's already starting to look like a lower receiver ...
After the profile was roughed , I then made a finish pass with a 1/ 4 " carbide ball nose endmill .
I started at one end of the receiver and machined across the whole profile stepping over 0.004 " each time .
So as you can imagine this process takes a really long time .
If you had a part that was 7 " long , and using a 0.004 " step over , it would have to make 1,750 passes .
Machining the receiver the way I did was n't the most cost effective way , but I was n't real worried about time , since this was my new hobby .
Here you can see what the receiver looked like after the finish profiling pass ...
The next step was to do all the detail machining and drilling the holes .
I also engraved on the side of the receiver .
You will see that I engraved AUTO , but this is strictly for looks !!!
Since I do n't want to spend any time in prison , I never have and never will make any full auto weapons .
Here 's what it looked like after the 1st operation ...
For the 2nd operation , I flipped the receiver over and machined the other side to remove the big slab of material .
Here you can see what it looked like at the start of the 2nd operation ...
In order to hold the receiver flat and square , I had to design a setup block that the receiver could set on while it was in the vice .
In this picture you can see what the early setup blocks looked like , the current setup blocks are much more advance than this early version ...
Here you can see how I made a rough pass around the outside of the receiver to remove most of the extra material ...
This picture is after I used the 3 " shell mill to flycut the receiver down to the correct thickness , and then used a carbide endmill to contour around the outside ...
I had to make the same rough and finish profiling passes as I did on the 1st operation .
I also engraved on this side of the receiver as well ...
At this point I 'm able to slide the pistol grip on the receiver a little ways ...
For the 3rd operation I machined the fire control area and the part of the magazine ( mag ) well .
Since the mag well is so deep , I could n't get an endmill down to the full depth , so I decided to machine part of the mag well from the top side and finish machining it from the bottom side .
Since the endmill will leave a radius in the corner , I will have to go back and use a file to file out the corners so a mag can slide in .
Most companies use a wire EDM ( Electrical Discharge Machine ) , or a broach to complete the mag well , but since I did n't have access to these types of tooling , I had to just machine the mag well , and finish it with a file .
The next time I made these receivers I drilled the corners out with a small drill bit .
This saved alot of time since I did n't have to file so much material out , but for some reason I did n't think about this the first time I made the receivers .
The pic below is the setup I used for the 3rd operation , notice the setup blocks I made for both sides of the receiver to hold it flat and square ...
This is what the receiver looked like after the machining was finished ...
After the 3rd operation was finished , I was able to see if some of the fire control parts would fit .
Come to find out , everything fit perfectly ...
On the 4th operation I decided to drill the pistol grip hole .
I done this hole next , because I knew there was still enough material left inside the receiver that it would n't bend when I clamped it into the vice .
I used a C - clamp to help hold the blocks against the receiver , and to make everything more stable .
Notice the blocks I used to support the buffer tower .
These blocks gave me the correct angle so the pistol grip hole could be done in the exact location ...
Here is a pic after the hole was drilled and tapped for the pistol grip ...
For the 5th operation I machined the bottom of the receiver .
You will notice that I once again used the setup blocks .
The setup blocks ended up being a very useful piece of tooling ...
Here you can see what the receiver looked like after the 5th operation .
Notice the chamfer around the mag well .
I machined that using 3 - d profiling .
It was much easier for me to profile that chamfer instead of trying to use an angled endmill to contour around the mag well .
You can see how the cut from the top side of the mag well matched up with the bottom cut .
It matched up much better than what the picture shows ...
The 6th operation I machined the buffer hole .
Most people use a drill / reamer / and tap for this hole , but since I was doing this on a CNC machine , I went with just milling the hole and then using a thread mill to cut the threads .
A thread mill is just like an endmill in that it contours the hole , but as it's going around the hole , it 's also going down , so all 3 axes of the CNC machine is moving at the same time .
Machining the threads in this fashion leaves great looking threads .
Here you can see the setup that I used ...
This is a picture after the hole was contoured with a endmill and ready to be tapped ...
Here is a picture of the thread mill cutting the threads ...
And here is what the receiver looked like after the buffer was threaded and the hole for the detent was drilled ...
For the 7th operation I drilled the front detent hole .
The setup for this operation was basically the same as the buffer hole setup ...
For the 8th operation I drilled the hole that keeps the buffer spring held back .
This is n't a very good pic of the hole , but maybe you can get an idea of how this operation was setup ...
The 9th operation is the last operation .
This operation I drilled the bolt catch hole .
A 6 " long aircraft extension drill is needed for this hole .
I was scared to do this operation on the CNC .
So I ended up putting it on a manual mill .
This would allow me to guide the drill bit in the correct location .
The drill has a small diameter and is very long , so it would be very easy for the drill to just " walk " off .
I later designed a bolt stop fixture that would guide the drill bit in the exact location , I could even do this hole with just a cordless drill .
After I designed the new style setup blocks , I incorporated this bolt stop fixture in the blocks .
Here you can see how I drilled this hole without any special tooling ...
In the pic below you can see the AR - 15 lower receivers that I made .
Making the receivers is the easy part , the hard part is finding the money to complete all the receivers ...
Since the 3 - d profiling leaves such a great finish on the receiver , I decided to polish one of the receivers to a mirror finish and clear anodize it .
I spent many many hours polishing the receiver to this mirror finish , but I think it was well worth it , since I was very happy with the results .
In the picture you can also see the mirror finished A2 upper that I machined from billet ...
That 's it for the AR - 15 Lower Receiver Project .
The AR - 10 lower receiver project will be very similar to this AR - 15 lower receiver .
For information on the new tooling blocks click on the " Tooling " link at the top .
I just finished a HK416 clone .
I tried to machine the lower as close as possible to the real HK416 .
Below you will find progress pics along with the finished rifle .
I 've started a thread on the cncguns forum discussing this lower ...
DISCUSSION THREAD
Below are pics of a batch of HK416 clones I made a while back .
Click HERE for a link to the old thread discussing these lowers .
For the latest updates on these HK416 lowers , please check my NEWS page .
Below is what the lowers looked like before I sent them off to be broached ...
And below is what the final HK416 clones look like ...
Below are pics of the lower that the customer Hk996 finished .
He took the lower to a local polisher and had the lower polished to a mirror finish .
I think it 's amazing how shiny the lower is .
I 've been playing around with a little AR15 2 tone splash anodizing .
I tried it a few years ago but I did n't have much success .
I decided to try it again with a little different technique .
In case you did n't know , 2 tone splash anodizing is an anodize coating in which there are two colors in the anodic coating instead of 1 solid color .
The technique of doing this is pretty proprietary so you can't find a whole lot of info about it on the internet .
Since I have several hours in trial and error I 'd prefer not to detail my exact steps since we may be offering this at my " day job " .
But I can tell you in a nut shell , the process is basically anodizing and coloring the part twice with a masking step in between .
The process is very time consuming , therefore very expensive .
I searched the internet for AR15 2 tone splash anodizing , but I came up empty .
So I decided to anodize a scrap upper and lower receiver and you can see the results below .
I anodized the charging handle gold for a little contrast .
It looks like the upper and lower were in a bloody crime scene .... kinda reminds me of the tv show DEXTER .

Monsanto , the multinational agricultural giant who sells 90 % of the world ’s genetically engineered seeds , has been in the news a lot this month … and as usual , it ’s not the kind of press they ’d like to have .
We usually post a funny image , video , or story on Fridays .
For that reason , we ’re going to chuckle over some incredible Monsanto illustrations by the talented cartoonist , Joe Mohr .
… but we ’re still going to file this one in the [ not - so ] funny Friday folder .
Read on below the cartoons to learn more about what they ’re alluding to .
Cartoon # 1 : Monsanto Claus
This cartoon originally appeared on Wend Magazine ’s Wendblog .
It ’s making a pretty blatant point about the multiple ways Monsanto is holding the world ’s seed supply hostage .
As the Monsanto Wikipedia page says ,
“ Monsanto is frequently described by farmers as ‘ Gestapo ’ and ‘ Mafia ’ both because of these lawsuits and because of the questionable means they use to collect evidence of patent infringement . ”
Cartoon # 2 : Africa ’s Agricultural Woes = Profit ( for others )
This cartoon appeared on Ecopolitology a couple of days ago .
Millions of Africans ( and people in countless other 3rd world countries ) are suffering and dying from failed agricutural ventures .
Monsanto has the seeds that could help feed the masses but instead chooses to “ let them eat cake ” , as it were .
Cartoon # 3 : Monsanto Corn Causes Organ Damage in Mammals
This cartoon was seen on Twilight Earth — who , along with Organic Lifestyle magazine , is one of THE authorities on all things Monsanto .
Twilight Earth recently reported on a December 2009 study that was published in the International Journal of Biological Sciences which shows that 3 varieties of Monsanto ’s genetically modified corn cause organ damage in mammals .
The report says ,
“ The data “ clearly underlines adverse impacts on kidneys and liver , the dietary detoxifying organs , as well as different levels of damages to heart , adrenal glands , spleen and haematopoietic system , ” reported Gilles - Eric Séralini , a molecular biologist at the University of Caen . ”
This , of course , means that maybe those African ’s with agricultural troubles should be glad that Monsanto wo n’t help out with free or low - priced seeds .
What Can WE Do About All Of This ?
Sign Change.org ’s petition to force Monsanto to stop producing GMO ( genetically modified organism ) corn .
Check out the movie , “ Food , Inc. ” for more information about GMO ’s and Monsanto .

Two Cheers For Tom WolfeIn his memorable introduction to The New Journalism , a 1973 collection of classic magazine pieces , Tom Wolfe declared that modern American fiction was dead .
The novel had lost touch with its roots , he wrote , with the " joys of detailed realism and its strange powers . "
Wolfe thought the new king of letters was journalism , which could provide the texture and in sight of Dickens or Dostoevsky with the added benefit of being true .
For young journalists , this was intoxicating stuff .
Why feel guilty about that abandoned novel in the desk drawer ?
The future was in reporting .
And reporting was suddenly more than just relevant or fun .
While Woodward and Bernstein were busy proving that journalism could bring down the government , wolfe showed how it could change writing and enrich the culture .
The ideal of applying the techniques of fiction to journalism , if not original to Wolfe , nonetheless kicked off a golden age in American journalism .
Even his worst imitators could not dim the importance of what he had done .
Then , after the enormous success of The Right Stuff , Wolfe changed his mind .
He embarked on a novel , which first was serialized in Rolling Stone .
The original installments , often written under extreme deadline pressure , were engaging but unsatisfying .
When the novel appeared , it was clear why .
Wolfe 's original protagonist was a famous Upper East Side novelist ; now he was a bond trader on Wall Street .
The substitution was essential to the book 's success .
For something had changed in New York .
Since the 1920s , the reigning cultural con men-- the ones who cut the wides swath in the life of the city , whatever thier real talent -- had been in the arts .
Wall Street was just a place where you made a living .
But by the mid-1980s , this was no longer true .
The biggest con artists were no longer artists .
That meant that satirizing bloated literary or artistic figures was suddenly not much of a public service .
In the classic " W " formulation , Norman Mailer and Leonard Bernstein were Out ; Saul Steinberg ( the financier , not The New Yorker cartoonist ) and John Gutfreund ( the chief of Salomon Bros . ) were In .
And it was n't just that a few corporate raiders found their names in the papers all the time .
The status was trickling down .
Before long , bond traders were not only making a fortune , they were actually getting laid more than sculptors from the Village , a remarkable social transformation .
There 's little need to reprise the uproarious and exhaustively reviewed highlights of this book .
" Lemon Tarts " ( the gorgeous young blonds on the arms of septuagenarian billionaires ) and " social X rays " ( Pat Buckley and Nan Kempner types ; too rich and too thin ) may soon enter the language along with " radical chic , " " The Me Decade " and Wolfe 's other nonfiction contributions .
The Bavardage dinner party is as revealing as any cooked up by Proust .
The speaker - phone conference call with Gene Lopwitz ( supposedly based on Gutfreund ) should shame that instrument of communication out of existence .
Peter Fallow , Wolfe 's freeloading British tabloid journalist , has a friend who writes Marxist diatribes while supporting himself with fluffery in House and Garden ( Alexander Cockburn call home ) .
From now on , any husband planning to phone his mistress will make sure not to leave the house and absent - mindedly call his own number , as Sherman McCoy did .
The list of great moments could go on for as long as a New York party , and often has .
This is one of those rare trendy books that people do not just pretend to read .
The wonderful thing is that by succeeding , Wolfe may help American fiction in much the same way he helped American nonfiction .
He has mustered one of the first expeditionary forces aimed at liberating the novel from its post - modern oppressor , which sometimes goes by the name of minimalism .
Whatever its slender attributes , the minimalist fashion has clearly grown out of hand in recent years .
It has almost gotten to the point where if something actually happened in a novel , beyond a walk on the beach or a meaningful sigh , then by definition it had to be second - rate " genre " fiction - - a thriller , mystery , or spoof .
Many of Wolfe 's critics wrongly assail it along these lines : funny and smart but not " real " literature , whatever that means .
The characters are n't deep enough , they say ; they 're too broad and cartoonish , too full of curlicues that signify nothing .
If that has a familiar ring , it 's because it resonates of Wolfe 's old quarrel with The New Yorker , home of the Nothing Happens school of short story writing , which extends back to his famous early - 1960s attack on William Shawn in the old New York Herald Tribune Sunday Magazine .
The struggle later surfaced over another medium : architecture .
The point of From Bauhaus to Our House was that minimalism offended Wolfe in any form .
He sees spare , fine lines as signs of boredom more often than beauty .
Glass boxes stink .
Beaux arts is beautiful .
Obviously there are limits to the importance of external design .
Wolfe overdoes descriptions of clothes and furniture : just because he dresses to make a statement does n't mean that everybody does .
Still , there is much that is right about his emphasis on details .
Novels are in large part about observation , and this is the most fully reported work of fiction in years .
It used to be that much great American literature was written by former reporters like Stephen Crane or Ernest Hemingway ; now it 's written by graduates of creative writing workshops .
The difference shows here , in the legwork .
It is the richness of detail that moves Wolfe 's characters beyond stereotypes and makes the into people that we can all recognize .
Satirized .
Larger than life .
But real .
Through the fools ' eyes This alone would make Bonfire significant .
But Wolfe has the advantage of something else -- timing .
Just one step ahead of the conventional wisdom , he made Wall Street the villain .
Wolfe knew that what he called " plutography " -- graphic depiction of the glorious lives of the rich and famous - - could n't last , and he devoted himself to hastening its demise .
Along with Spy magazine , founded in 1986 , he rode the wave perfectly .
For Wolfe and for Spy , the stock market crash came not as a shock but as a validation .
Everyone else in New York is now scrambling to catch up .
Suddenly New York magazine has stopped puffing the John Gutfreunds of the world and started trashing them , which is the way it should have been in the first place .
It 's easier now , when they 're down .
Wolfe did it when they were up ; he realized that this worshipping of rich shit - heads had gone too far .
" Masters of the Universe " is a wonderful way of summarizing how terrific these guys thought they were .
And Sherman , who coins the phrase , is a sympathetic character because he removes that little gnawing idea that some readers have about these young millionaire investment bankers and traders -- the idea , buried inside too many of us , that their fabulous success actually proves that they are smarter than everyone else .
Sherman is such a pathetic guy that we know , just know , that the men he symbolizes are nothing much either .
And that 's healthy .
The fact that the crash made it obvious -- and thus created an instantly receptive audience for Wolfe 's book -- is what one might call earned good fortune .
Of course , besides being a novel of manners , Bonfire is a novel of race and class .
That 's what makes it as political book .
Race and class are frequently avoided by modern minimalist novelists , who cannot imagine that such concerns might be relevant to the identity crises of their characters .
Wolfe puts these issues at the center of the novel .
And the subtleties are right .
There 's a terrific scene , for instance , where Lawrence Kramer , the young lawyer , feels inferior to a haughty British nanny he 's hired until she makes a racist comment , which immediately allows him to feel superior again .
That 's because spoken racism is gauche in liberal , professional Manhattan .
Racists must observe the proper etiquette , which is to pretend that they are not .
Wolfe has long made a subspeciality of pushing these buttons on race and class .
" Radical Chic " ( where he made fun of Leonard Bernstein 's 1969 party for the Black Panthers ) and " Mau - Mauing the Flak Catchers " ( a description of the way black poverty activists intimidated white bureaucrats ) seemed to white liberals to confirm that the Virginia - born author was a racist .
Bonfire fuels the flames of that old fight , and for reasons that may not be immediately apparent .
First , there 's the matter of literary device .
Including Sherman , Wolfe goes inside the heads of about half a dozen characters .
None of these people are portrayed in an especially flattering light and most look like fools .
But at least the rest of the world is seen through their eye for a few pages .
Those eyes are never black .
Wolfe will walk in Sherman 's shoes or Fallow's , but not in those of Rev. Bacon ( the media - manipulating , rabble - rousing Harlem minister ) or Henry Lamb ( the teenager Sherman and his mistress run over in their car ) .
In fact , besides Lamb and his mother , blacks in the novel are either corruptor simply barbarians ready to storm the gates of civilization .
Wolfe is correct that this is a reflection of how white Manhattan views Harlem and the Bronx .
But how about the way Harlem and the Bronx view white Manhattan ?
Other than targeting rich whites for money and manipulation -- Rev. Bacon 's approach -- the black view gets lost .
Blacks are either a mob or exotic urban fauna .
They are never seen as individuals .
Of course , it could be argued that the point - of - view queation is irrelevant because no one in the book comes out looking good .
This is satire , and satire is often set in a world without heroes .
Besides , there 's an original and bracing quality to Wolfe 's nihilism .
It 's just plain funnier to dump on everyone -- with an extra kick in the teeth to the people who are rich and powerful enough to take it .
That is Spy 's secret , too .
Real courageBut the rough equality achieved by trashing everyone and everything carries a steep price .
This is a novel about New York that does n't capture the joy that the city brings to so many people -- it does n't explain why New Yorkers ( including Wolfe himself ) put up with all the lunacy instead of moving away .
In that sense , it is not the complete book on the culture of the city .
The explanation of why people want to live there may be obvious to New Yorkers -- so obvious , apparently , that it never needs to be said .
( Shelly the juror , for instance , never has to say why she wants Kramer 's help in getting an apartment in Manhattan ) .
At the same time , the rest of the country thinks it 's just as obvious that anyone who actually lives there is crazy .
Wolfe never reconciles the two .
He shares the unspoken assumption of his fellow New Yorkers but assumes the essential critique of non-New Yorkers .
More important , as many critics have pointed out , Wolfe suggests a hopelessness about New York 's problems of race and class , as if those chasms really are unbridgeable -- not even worth trying to bridge .
Dickens always had at least one redeeming character -- say , Pip in Great Expectations -- who carried within him the seeds of hope .
Wolfe has no one .
Or practically no one .
There is Martin , the detective who , to Kramer 's horror , tells the tough black guy to move his car .
And Kovitsky , the Bronx judge assigned to Sherman 's case who stands up to the thugs populating the courtroom Sherman himself is even redeemed a bit at the end of the novel when , stripped of his phony dignity , he goes to court without fear .
Why does Wolfe like these men ?
For the same reason he admired Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff .
The value that Wolfe admires above all others is physical courage , as he readily admits .
In a recent interview with Insight , the newsmagazine of The Washington Times , Wolfe said : " I think of Huckleberry Finn .
There 's a chapter on Col.
Sherwood , who has saved somebody from lynching .
A mob approaches his house , but he comes out to the front , and it 's not a mob anymore .
I think of that type of figure , of what it means to physically confront something very bad in the name of something worthwhile .
That is always admired .
" In the name of something worthwhile .
But what ?
A closer reading of Huckleberry Finn suggests that Col. Sherburn , not Sherwood , was saving not some poor innocent , but himself , a cold - blooded murderer .
That 's the unresolved issue in The Bonfire of the Vanities .
It sometimes seems that Wolfe believes the notion of physical courage is itself worthwhile .
This , at bottom , is what has alwarys so infuriated liberals about him .
" Radical Chic " and " Mau - Mauing the Flak Catchers " were not just charges of paternal racism , not just gibes at naive liberalism -- they were essays that said to whites : you are appeasers .
And why were they appeasing blacks ?
Because they were scared of them .
This was the subtext .
Wolfe was affronting the manhood of these white liberals , many of whom would n't go to Vietnam , and that hurt .
For Wolfe , making that point -- twisting the knife with relish - - was worthwhile .
If you 're a bleeding heart , you may end up hurt , bleeding real blood !
Or it could be that the positve value he has been upholding all these years is simply order .
That would explain the Col. " Sherwood " reference .
The white lynch mobs of the 19th century have become the black lynch mobs of the 20th , a peculiar and disturbing implication on Wolfe 's part .
Or maybe the " worthwhile " thing to do is simply play the old New York game , which Spy is now playing so well : figure out who 's
Out a step ahead of everyone else -- for instance , anticipating that Gutfreund would be Out - - then reap the praise .
That is the more cynical explanation of Wolfe 's prescience in writing this book .
Then again , cynicism is now In , as Spy 's success tells us .
Whatever the explanation , The Bonfire of the Vanities is clearly missing some critical sense of commitment .
It 's not enough , in literature , simply to stand up for bravery .
The question should always be : Courage for what ?
Moral courage ?
The courage of convictions ?
The courage required for love ?
In attacking the liberal dogma of the 1960s , Wolfe showed the social and journalistic equivalent of physical bravery .
Another variation would be the Wall Street courage to bet the house on a hunch , as Sherman might do .
But committing capital -- or New York social suicide -- is not the same as committing yourself .
For years ,
Wolfe has had the courage to say what he is against , while avoiding the responsibility to say what he is for .
Doing so might put him at risk of looking foolish .
It might open him up to the ridicule of some new Tom Wolfe .
But suggesting that Wolfe ( not to mention Spy ) need some " commitment " is not an argument for ruining them .
Cervantes and Shakespeare proved that humor and commitment can coexist ; they loved the men they made fun of .
With similar empathy , Wolfe 's powers of observation could have been harnessed to something more noble than tweaking New York .
If he had mustered the courage to stand up for something he believed in , the novel would have been richer -- infinitely richer than Lopwitz - - and the world in which it is set a less forsaken place .
More than eight years after the 9/11 attacks , Washington is again probing how US analysts failed to “ connect the dots ” leading up to a terrorist attempt – and how to do better in the future .
That ’s the aim of a midafternoon meeting with President Obama and 20 top government officials who have been tasked with a review of the Christmas Day incident on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 .
It ’s an exercise Washington has launched before , most notably after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
In both cases , investigators aimed to construct a timeline – who knew what , when they knew it , and what they did with what they knew – to identify missed opportunities and to propose fixes .
At least some of the post - 9/11 fixes worked , say Obama administration officials .
Threat assessments were available across agency lines – unlike in the run-up to the 9/11 attacks .
The name of suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was on a broad terrorist database maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center ( NCTC ) , which both intelligence and law - enforcement agencies could access .
But Mr. Abdulmutallab ’s name was not elevated to a no - fly list or flagged for special notice .
In retrospect , that appears to be a shortcoming .
On Monday , the White House announced that terrorist databases have been scrubbed since the Dec. 25 incident .
Yet connecting the dots in hindsight does n’t capture the issues facing intelligence analysts on a daily basis , these analysts say .
They have a sea of data to go through – and finding and acting on the crucial bits can be a formidable challenge .
“ The task that officials faced in this most recent incident was typical of the task they have to perform every day : trying to identify as significant a few fragments of information that are little different from the huge flow of reporting – most of which has nothing to do with any terrorist plots , ” says former senior CIA analyst Paul Pillar , director of graduate studies at the Center for Peace and Security Studies at Georgetown University in Washington .
“ In real time , the dots can be connected in innumerable , comparably plausible , different ways – most of them wrong , ” he adds .
In testimony before a Senate panel on Dec. 9 , Timothy Healy , director of the FBI ’s Terrorist Screening Center , said that the center receives every day “ between 400 and 1,200 unique additions , modifications , or deletions of terrorist identities . ”
Terrorist screening occurs anywhere from embassies or ports of entry to a police stop or the place where a gun is purchased .
To elevate a name from the NCTC ’s Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment ( TIDE ) database to the more actionable Terrorist Watchlist requires “ articulable facts ” about an individual having ties to terrorist activities .
“ Mere guesses or inarticulate hunches are not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion , ” Mr. Healy said .
The Terrorist Watchlist is made up of some 400,000 people .
The no-fly list includes even stricter standards .
After the Christmas Day incident , Mr. Obama called on his administration to focus on two issues : improved screening for air travel and an upgrade to the US system for terror watch lists .
Earlier this week , the administration mandated stricter airport screening for citizens of 14 nations and those on flights originating or passing through them .
The screening includes full - body pat - downs and more - intensive searches of carry - on luggage .

CAIRO — An Egyptian court on Saturday overturned a lower court ruling that called for a halt to natural gas exports to Israel , saying the deliveries should continue unhindered .
The case arose in 2008 when opposition groups filed suit that called for a halt to the shipments , alleging the gas was being sold too cheaply .
An appeals court ruled that gas deliveries to Israel should continue , but ordered the government to review the price and quantity of gas .
It may seem strange to talk about yoga on a site devoted to alternative medicine and alternative health care .
Yet , when you get right down to it yoga belongs in the discussion the same as massage therapy , nutrition , reflexology and the rest of the categories listed on Alternative Medicine Now .
Why ?
Because alternative therapies accept one fundamental fact of human existence that “ traditional ” western medicine ignored a long time ago .
Which is … that health is holistic in nature , and encompasses the idea of a sound mind and a sound body .
Yoga & Your Health
Today more than ever we understand the role of stress in our lives , especially the role of stress as it relates to our immune system .
For example , this article from About.com sums it up nicely :
“ Chronic , long - term stress suppresses the immune system .
The longer the stress , the more the immune system shifted from they adaptive changes seen in the “ fight or flight ” response to more negative changes , first at the cellular level and later in broader immune function . ”
The point is , reducing the harmful long - term affects of stress will improve your overall health .
And alternative health strategies like yoga focus on overall wellness , versus the traditional focus of “ western ” medicine on symptom reduction and treatment of disease after the fact .
Additionally , here is a quote that sums up the many benefits of yoga :
“ Yoga ’s many health benefits include greater flexibility , increased strength and endurance , a lessening in stress , greater coordination , greater energy , and even a relief of PMS and menstrual cramps .
Yoga is great for everyone and it is pretty possible to find a class to suit anyone ’s needs . ”
~ Mike Bunata
So the fact remains … the benefits of yoga are too numerous to ignore .
Yoga as exercise might be “ trendy . ”
But yoga as alternative health therapy is undeniable as well .

LOS ANGELES , Feb. 26 ( UPI ) --
A silicone breast implant saved the life of a California woman who was shot in the chest by a gunman , a doctor says .
The gunman aimed his weapon directly at Lydia Carranza 's heart but one of her implants stopped the bullet and prevented any fragments from reaching her vital organs , the Los Angeles Times reports .

" She 's just one lucky woman , " said Dr. Ashkan Ghavami .
" The bullet fragments were millimeters from her heart and her vital organs .
Had she not had the implant , she might not be alive today .
Carranza was working in a Beverly Hills dental office last July when the estranged husband of a co-worker ran in and opened fire , killing his wife and then firing at Carranza .
" Common sense would dictate that any time you have something that interrupts the velocity of the projectile , it would benefit the object it was trying to strike , " said Scott Reitz , a deadly - force expert who was not involved in the case .
No matter your opinion of Valentine ’s Day , we can all agree it ’s a good excuse to binge on chocolate , right ?
So , that ’s what I ’m giving you this week .
Chocolate .
Because that , my friends , is how I show my love .
For the Super Bowl , my friend Rachel made us two utterly delectable chocolate treats .
Today I share with you her homemade oreos .
Tomorrow …well , it ’s a surprise !
But it is most certainly Valentine ’s Day worthy !
I ’m not a huge fan of store - bought Oreos .
I know , how can I call myself an American ?
But even I , the evil Oreo - disser , loved these cookies .
It ’s certainly a derivative of the classic Oreo , but much so much better .
Rachel found the recipe on Smitten Kitchen , one of the best food blogs out there .
Ignited by the Comcast fiasco in the US , the concept of Net Neutrality has been brought into the mainstream resulting in planned government interventions .
However , unlike the name suggests , Net Neutrality might not stop BitTorrent blocking and could leave us worse off than when this all started .
Although Comcast has been at the center of the BitTorrent blocking and Net Neutrality debate , they are certainly not the only Internet provider targeting the popular file - sharing protocol .
All around the world , hundreds of larger and smaller ISPs are actively interfering with BitTorrent traffic , allegedly to keep their networks in good shape .
Thus far , only Comcast has been punished for doing so .
In 2008 the FCC looked into Comcast ’s BitTorrent blocking and concluded that the company ’s network management practices were unfair because they specifically targeted BitTorrent , not any other protocols .
The FCC ordered Comcast to stop blocking BitTorrent transfers , and last year the communications commission decided to take up the task of ensuring that the Internet remains neutral .
At least , that was the initial plan , the reality is less hopeful .
Although it was Comcast ’s anti-BitTorrent measures that sparked the current Net Neutrality debate , the FCC ’s current proposals are not going to stop ISPs from slowing down or even blocking BitTorrent traffic .
In fact , if these rules are implemented , BitTorrent users will be worse off than three years ago .
In the 107 page proposal detailing the Net Neutrality regulation , the FCC says that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally , but it allows ISPs to slow down or block traffic if it ’s considered to be “ reasonable network management ” .
So the key issue is , what are reasonable network management practices and how may these affect BitTorrent traffic ?
Let ’s take a look at what the FCC has to say about this .
Reasonable network management consists of reasonable practices employed by a provider of broadband Internet access service to [ … ] ( i ) reduce or mitigate the effects of congestion on its network or to address quality - of - service concerns ; [ … ] ( iii ) prevent the transfer of unlawful content ; or ( iv ) prevent the unlawful transfer of content .
In short , this means that ISPs have plenty of options to target BitTorrent traffic and keep the Net Neutral at the same time .
Let ’s take a closer look .
As the EFF has also pointed out , the latter two conditions ( iii and iv ) would make it perfectly reasonable to block BitTorrent traffic for the purpose of preventing piracy .
The terminology is rather vague , but we expect that when the MPAA or RIAA produce a report stating that 95 % of all BitTorrent traffic involves copyright violations , blocking BitTorrent may become perfectly reasonable .
And that ’s just one of the many loopholes .
There are also plenty of options for ISPs to target BitTorrent traffic without going for the piracy / copyright angle .
In fact , congestion issues and quality - of - service concerns are even more viable and can be implemented to target BitTorrent traffic specifically , but indirectly .
Under the proposed plans , ISPs could simply manage their networks by slowing down connections that use “ too many ” TCP connections , one of the key characteristics of BitTorrent traffic .
There are plenty of arbitrary rules that may look reasonable and neutral , but will specifically ( not exclusively ) hinder BitTorrent transfers to ease the strain on the network .
In fact , the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) which develops and promotes Internet standards is working on a proposal that might kill BitTorrent traffic if implemented .
The proposed protocol will mark all packets which are expected to cause congestion as “ negative packets , ” which is likely to apply to and slow down most peer - to - peer traffic .
One way or another , the FCC ’s Net Neutrality plan is no guarantee that BitTorrent will be able to download at full speeds .
On the contrary , the plans might actually encourage ISPs to use Deep Packet Inspection technologies to check if the traffic of its subscribers is lawful , if it ’s the last resort to slow down BitTorrent .
We do n’t want that to happen do we ?

Low Fat Whipped Dressing in Coffee
In the comments to a previous post , a fellow named Taft wrote the following :
I shared the love on Metafilter a few days ago .
So perhaps I have a voice in what you review next ( heh ) ?
I suggest mayonnaise and / or crumbled up Doritos in the grounds .
Indeed , the link from Metafilter is largely responsible for a lot of this blog ’s recent success , so Taft deserves special attention .
Mayonnaise it is !
Except I do n’t have any mayonnaise around .
I do n’t even have its cheap and ugly little brother , Miracle Whip .
Oh , but what have we here ?
PC Low Fat Whipped Dressing ?
I suppose that ’s the next next best thing .
After my Eggspresso post , several people wrote in to suggest improvements .
One that came up repeatedly was to whisk the egg into a little bit of coffee , then slowly add the rest , so it turns into a thick cream rather than a chunky mess .
Since whipped dressing has egg in it , I thought I ’d try this technique .
It seems to be working .
There are a few floaty bits , but mostly it looks like coffee with a nice amount of cream .
I slowly whisk in a full mug .
It ’s looking good .
Does n’t smell too bad .
Maybe this will be a surprise success .
Bottoms up .
Oh .
Oh my god .
The moment it enters my mouth , I know that something has gone wrong .
It ’s sour ; oh jesus , it ’s like acid burning my tongue .
In the name of science , I take another sip .
No yeah , this is the closest I ’ve come to chugging vomit .
Somehow it ’s even worse than blue cheese dip .
I should have gone with the Doritos .
In a just - published paper in the magazine Science , IBM researchers demonstrated a radio - frequency graphene transistor with the highest cut - off frequency achieved so far for any graphene device -- 100 billion cycles / second ( 100 GigaHertz ) .
This accomplishment is a key milestone for the Carbon Electronics for RF Applications ( CERA ) program funded by DARPA , in an effort to develop next - generation communication devices .
The high frequency record was achieved using wafer - scale , epitaxially grown graphene using processing technology compatible to that used in advanced silicon device fabrication .
" A key advantage of graphene lies in the very high speeds in which electrons propagate , which is essential for achieving high - speed , high - performance next generation transistors , " said Dr. T.C. Chen , vice president , Science and Technology , IBM Research .
" The breakthrough we are announcing demonstrates clearly that graphene can be utilized to produce high performance devices and integrated circuits . "
Graphene is a single atom - thick layer of carbon atoms bonded in a hexagonal honeycomb - like arrangement .
This two - dimensional form of carbon has unique electrical , optical , mechanical and thermal properties and its technological applications are being explored intensely .
Uniform and high - quality graphene wafers were synthesized by thermal decomposition of a silicon carbide ( SiC ) substrate .
The graphene transistor itself utilized a metal top - gate architecture and a novel gate insulator stack involving a polymer and a high dielectric constant oxide .
The gate length was modest , 240 nanometers , leaving plenty of space for further optimization of its performance by scaling down the gate length .
It is noteworthy that the frequency performance of the graphene device already exceeds the cut - off frequency of state - of - the - art silicon transistors of the same gate length ( ~ 40 GigaHertz ) .
Similar performance was obtained from devices based on graphene obtained from natural graphite , proving that high performance can be obtained from graphene of different origins .
Previously , the team had demonstrated graphene transistors with a cut - off frequency of 26 GigaHertz using graphene flakes extracted from natural graphite .
At the same time the California legislature is struggling with a nearly $ 20 billion budget deficit , it is also putting jobs creation at the top of its agenda .
In introducing a 27 - bill package the Senate Democratic Caucus says will create at least 140,000 jobs in the state , Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , stressed the link between the two issues .
“ I have been through enough budgets to know that the only way to increase and sustain the tax base is to create high wage jobs , ” Steinberg said Feb .
9 . “ Of course , the entire country is talking about job creation , but its importance ca n’t be overstated in California .
There is no more important barometer of economic struggle and family suffering than a 12.4 percent unemployment rate . ”
Among African Americans , officially counted joblessness is far higher , exceeding 16 percent in the state , and affecting nearly half of African American youth .
Unemployment among California Hispanics has passed 17 percent .
The Senate Democrats cited California Research Bureau figures showing that creating 100,000 jobs would generate $ 6.7 billion in economic activity annually , provide the General Fund with about $ 2.3 billion in increased revenue and avoided costs , and result in a net gain in employment of about 300,000 jobs .
They also said the new jobs would be created “ without raising taxes or waiving any environmental , consumer , or workplace protection laws ” and would need only a majority vote for approval .
In the past Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has sought to use budget deficits as a pretext to weaken such protections .
The Democratic majority in both legislative houses falls short of the two - thirds needed to pass budgets and taxes , and virtually all Republicans have signed a no - new - taxes pledge .
“ We need to make jobs priority number one in this state , ” California Labor Federation spokesman Steve Smith said in a telephone interview .
“ We ’re seeing soaring unemployment , we ’re seeing budget cuts that are making it nearly impossible for this economy to recover , and the only way we are going to get out of this mess is by creating good jobs . ”
Besides supporting the legislature ’s efforts to put people to work right away , Smith added , “ We still need to be doing much more in terms of job creation .
We need to continue to work for federal dollars for things like high speed rail , that wo n’t just create jobs – but jobs with benefits and good wages .
That ’s how we will get back to a place where the California economy is doing well again . ”
The 27 bills in the Democrats ’ “ Agenda 2010 ” legislative package fall into four categories .
Several measures – some dependent on passage of federal jobs legislation – would expedite the state ’s use of federal funds and unspent state bond funds for high speed rail , construction of schools and affordable housing , and improving highways , streets and public transit systems .
Other measures would promote renewable energy projects including some that can make use of federal stimulus funds and other moneys that are already available .
Among these : helping community colleges build or rebuild facilities to train students for clean technology and renewable energy occupations , creating jobs in environmental restoration and flood control , and helping clean up diesel pollution from trucks moving goods from ports and other goods movement hubs .
The Employee Development Department ’s work share program would be expanded so more workers can keep their jobs and get partial unemployment benefits , and companies would be rewarded for hiring California workers on contracts with the state .
A range of measures would promote job training , revise current state worker furlough provisions to exempt workers not paid through state general funds , aid distressed homeowners to stay in their homes , and rationalize student fee structures at public institutions of higher education .

Incident At Philadelphia Airport Highlights Misdirected Security Efforts , Says ACLU
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
PHILADELPHIA – The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Pennsylvania today filed a lawsuit on behalf of Pomona College student Nicholas George , who was abusively interrogated , handcuffed and detained for nearly five hours at the Philadelphia International Airport because of a set of English - Arabic flashcards he was carrying in connection with his college language studies .
" Arresting and restraining passengers who pose no threat to flight safety and are not breaking any law not only violates people 's rights , but it wo n't make us any safer .
It may actually make us less safe , by diverting vital resources and attention away from true security threats , " said Ben Wizner , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project .
" Nick George was handcuffed , locked in a cell for hours and questioned about 9/11 simply because he has chosen to study Arabic , a language that is spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world .
This sort of harassment of innocent travelers is a waste of time and a violation of the Constitution . "
George was on his way back to school in California in August 2009 when he was prompted by Transportation Security Authority ( TSA ) agents to empty his pockets at an airport security screening point .
After producing a set of English - Arabic flashcards , which each had an English word on one side and the corresponding Arabic word on the other , George was detained by the TSA agents in the screening area for 30 minutes .
A TSA supervisor then arrived and aggressively questioned George , asking him questions such as how he felt about 9/11 , whether he knew " who did 9/11 " and whether he knew what language Osama bin Laden spoke .
A Philadelphia police officer then arrived , handcuffed George and led him through a terminal to the airport police station where he was left in a locked cell for two hours in the handcuffs , and for two more hours with the handcuffs removed .
George was then interrogated for half an hour by two FBI agents .
He was never informed of why he was handcuffed , detained or arrested , and he was not informed of his rights .
By the time he was released , George had long since missed his flight and was told by airline officials that he would have to wait until the next day to travel .
" As someone who travels by plane , I want TSA agents to do their job to keep flights safe .
But I do n't understand how locking me up and harassing me just because I was carrying the flashcards made anybody safer , " said George .
" No one should be treated like a criminal for simply learning one of the most widely - spoken languages in the world . "
The lawsuit charges that the TSA officials , the Philadelphia police and the FBI violated George 's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure and his First Amendment right to free speech .
The ACLU filed the lawsuit on George 's behalf in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania , against the three TSA officers , two FBI agents and two members of the Philadelphia Police Department who were involved in his detainment and interrogation .
" It should not have taken four hours to determine that Nick George was not a security threat .
In fact , it should not have taken four minutes , " said Mary Catherine Roper , staff attorney with the ACLU of Pennsylvania .
" He was handcuffed and held behind bars for no reason .
These agents need to be held accountable for that . "
Lawyers on the case are Wizner and Jonathan Manes of the ACLU , Roper of the ACLU of Pennsylvania and David Rudovsky of the law firm Kairys , Rudovsky , Messing & Feinberg , LLP .

CASTAIC , Calif . --
A blustery winter storm peppered Southern California with heavy rain and hail Thursday , while layering a blanket of snow in local mountains and forcing hundreds of drivers to be stranded in a high pass north of Los Angeles .
The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning late Thursday for southwest Los Angeles County , including Malibu , Pacific Palisades and the Topanga area .
The weather service said a strong rotating thunderstorm was spotted over the eastern half of Malibu , moving north - northeast at 20 miles per hour .
No damage was immediately reported .
Many areas reported at least an inch of rain by nightfall .
In Ventura and Santa Barbara counties , some areas reported between two and three inches of rain .
Heavy rain was reported Thursday evening over the Los Angeles area .
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for the Santa Barbara County mountains through 10 p.m. Friday .
The snow level was expected to drop to between 2,000 and 3,000 feet Thursday night , and down to 1,500 feet during heavier showers or thunderstorms .
The storm forced the California Highway Patrol to shut down Interstate 5 late Wednesday on each side of the notorious Grapevine section of Tejon Pass , which rises to an elevation of more than 4,000 feet between the Los Angeles Basin and the San Joaquin Valley .
An estimated 300 to 500 trucks and cars were stuck overnight in a 40 - mile stretch of the major north - south artery but most had been guided out by morning , said CHP Officer Mark Ehly .
“ We were taking cars out pretty much one at a time ” through the night , he said .
A roughly 40 - mile stretch of the icy interstate remained closed Thursday evening .
There was no estimate as to when it would reopen , said CHP Officer Patrick Kimball .
About 70,000 vehicles normally use the Grapevine section of I - 5 each day , but its high elevation in the Tehachapi Mountains makes it susceptible to winter storms .
In Orange County , crews placed K-rails against several homes in fire - scarred Modjeska Canyon Thursday .
Up to 1 1/2 inches of rain fell Wednesday night in the area burned by October ’s Santiago fire , said Capt .
Mike Blawn of the Orange County Fire Authority .
“ The rain resulted in a few minor debris flows behind a few houses but as far as I know there was no structural damage , ” Blawn said .
Authorities are more concerned about a bigger storm forecast to hit the area over the weekend .
Forecasters are predicting 4 - 6 inches to hit south and southwest facing mountain slopes between Saturday night and Sunday morning .
Blawn said the county ’s emergency operations team is keeping a close look on the situation .
Heavy rain and overnight hail prompted the Santa Anita horse track in Arcadia to cancel races Thursday , the fourth time this month .
Its synthetic track has had drainage problems .
The storm was not expected to improve local water supplies .
One of the driest rain seasons on record left reservoirs so low last year that several cities called for voluntary water conservation .
“ It ’s a drop in the bucket compared to the levels that are really needed , ” said Ann Erdman , a spokeswoman for the city of Pasadena , which last month officially projected a water shortage .
Still , the storm and another on the way could prove beneficial , said Arthur Hinojosa , chief of the hydrology branch of the state Department of Water Resources .
“ Every drop helps , especially when you ’ve had a year like we did last year when we were shy and drew down a lot of reservoirs ... and groundwater , ” he said .
He noted that the West has been in a mild La Nina condition , referring to a change in ocean temperature that usually brings drier weather .
“ You get a couple more systems like this ... and things might look a lot better , ” he said .
The storm dumped several feet of snow in local mountains , to the delight of ski resorts .
However , its impact was less clear on the crucial Sierra Nevada snowpack that , when it melts , is a major water supplier for Southern California .
The first large - scale survey of the snowpack in the region is planned for next week , Hinojosa said .
By late Thursday , downtown Los Angeles had recorded 1.39 inches from the storm , raising its seasonal total above 7 inches , more than usually has accumulated to date .
But city has a long way to go in order to meet the average total of 15.14 inches for the whole season , which began on July 1 and runs through June 30 .
Birds largely rely on their sense of smell to navigate on their long migration routes .
Indeed , the “ third sense ” has been shown to be a more important for them than orientation based on the sun and the earth ’s magnetic field .
Exactly how birds navigate on their migration routes has not yet been fully clarified .
How does a bird develop an “ internal map ” ?
How does it find its way back to last year ’s nest ?
Adult migratory birds are clearly able to remember migration routes .
Even if they end up flying over unknown terrain , they still manage to find their way to the right place .
Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Radolfzell and their colleagues at the universities of Princeton , Pisa and Copenhagen have established in a field study that odours considerably facilitate bird migration and act as a more important navigational cue than the sun and the earth ’s magnetic field .
Researchers already know from the fledglings of many bird species that they use an inherited species - specific compass point to reach their wintering grounds on their first migratory journey .
If they are moved a significant distance away from their starting point , they fail to reach their destination .
As opposed to this , adult migratory birds are able to remember routes that they have flown just once , and to correct their flight direction following a change of location and find their way back to their wintering locations .
This is proof of real navigation performance and , based on this , scientists are trying to identify the factors and mechanisms that enable the animals to find their locations .
Researchers working with Richard Holland and Martin Wikelski from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Radolfzell and the University of Konstanz began by studying small songbirds in their natural environment .
To this end , they captured 24 adult and 24 juvenile catbirds ( Dumatella carolinensis ) in the field station of Princeton University ( New Jersey ) .
The researchers then manipulated the olfactory sense in eight birds from each group by applying a saline solution to the birds ' nasal mucous membranes .
As a result , the birds were no longer able to smell properly ; however , their olfactory cells were not permanently damaged .
The researchers also manipulated the magnetoreception capacity in another eight birds from each group by means of strong magnetic impulses .
The sensory perception of the birds in the control group remained unimpaired .
Simultaneous to this , 19 adult catbirds were captured in Illinois -- in the middle of the American continent -- transported overnight to New Jersey and divided there into the same three groups .
The scientists then fitted all of the birds with a radio transmitter weighing 0.9 grams and released them .
This enabled the ornithologists to observe the flight of the birds from the both the ground and the air .
In the course of their autumn migration , catbirds usually fly through New Jersey in a south - west direction along Delaware Bay .
If -- like their fellow species members in Illinois -- they flew a strict southern course , they would arrive in Cape May .
This would mean that they would cross Delaware Bay at its widest point or would have to fly northwards up the coast again until they reach a narrow point in the bay .
For this reason , adult birds usually avoid the direct southern route .
The non-smelling adult birds selected a different flight route than the experienced control group and the animals whose magnetoreception had been manipulated .
The birds , whose olfactory capacity had been impaired , were unable to find their bearings and flew south .
Like the juvenile birds , they had to fall back on their endogenous direction - finding skills because they could no longer rely on their sense of smell .
The animals from Illinois with impaired olfactory perception also flew in a southerly direction while the control group tried to compensate for the change in location by flying in a south - westerly or westerly direction .
In contrast to the olfactory manipulation , the magnetoreception manipulation did not affect the orientation in either the adult or juvenile birds .
" Other field studies have also failed to produce clear proof of any effect of the distortion of magnetoreception , " says Richard Holland .
Therefore , the question arises for the researchers as to how important the magnetic field actually is for avian navigation over large distances .
" Nevertheless , we do not assume that the failure of the magnetic pulse treatment to trigger any effect indicates that magnetoreception does not play any role in the migration of adult birds . "
The results of the study enabled the scientists to reach the initial conclusion that the olfactory sense is a significant component of the birds ' navigational chart .
In addition , the experiment also provides a reliable method for future field studies aiming to examine the role of environmental factors in bird migration .
At least a million people in Haiti are currently in need of aid The world 's leading industrialised nations have pledged to write off the debts that Haiti owes them , following a devastating earthquake last month .
Canada 's finance minister announced at a summit in Iqaluit , northern Canada , that Group of Seven countries planned to cancel Haiti 's bilateral debts .
Jim Flaherty said he would encourage international lenders to do the same .
Some $ 1.2bn ( £ 800 m ) of Haiti 's debts to countries and international lending bodies has already been cancelled .
" We are committed in the G7 to the forgiveness of debt , in fact all bilateral debt has been forgiven by G7 countries vis-a - vis Haiti , " Mr Flaherty said at the end of the two day gathering of finance ministers .
It must be right that a nation buried in rubble must not also be buried in debt
Gordon Brown
UK Prime Minister
Corruption fears stalk Haiti " The debt to multilateral institutions should be forgiven , and we will work with these institutions and other partners to make this happen as soon as possible , " he added .
At least one million people are in need of aid in Haiti after the magnitude 7.0 earthquake which struck in mid-January , killing more than 200,000 people .
The G7 group - which includes Canada , the US , UK , France , Germany , Italy and Japan - has been under pressure to help Haiti recover since the 12 January quake by cancelling the money owed by Haiti .
Haiti was rated as the poorest nation in the western hemisphere even before the earthquake struck .
Though exact figures are difficult to obtain , the exact amount owed bilaterally to G7 countries is believed to be quite small .
Brown 's pledge British Prime Minister Gordon Brown hailed the pledge , saying : " It must be right that a nation buried in rubble must not also be buried in debt " .
Debt relief is expected to free funds for the reconstruction effort " The UK has already cancelled all debts owed to it by Haiti and I strongly welcome today 's G7 commitment to forgive Haiti 's remaining multilateral debt , " he added .
" We will work with others to make sure this is delivered . "
On Friday , the US voiced support for the plan to extend international debt relief for Haiti .
" The earthquake in Haiti was a catastrophic setback to the Haitian people who are now facing tremendous emergency humanitarian and reconstruction needs , and meeting Haiti 's financing needs will require a massive multilateral effort , " said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner .
He said the US would seek to reach an agreement for the funds owed to the multilateral donors , which include the Inter - American Development Bank , the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the International Development Association .
Mr Geithner also echoed the call by the head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , to provide full relief of the country 's outstanding debt to the body , including a $ 102 m emergency loan approved in January .
Last June , the international community agreed to cancel some $ 1.2bn ( £ 800 m ) of the country 's total debt of $ 1.9bn owed to bi- and multilateral lenders including the IMF , World Bank and the US government , as part of a programme for heavily indebted poor countries .
UK - based charity Oxfam has urged the writing off of about an additional $ 900 m ( £ 557 m ) that Haiti still owes to donor countries and institutions .
Venezuela , one of Haiti 's biggest creditors , last month forgave the country 's $ 295 m oil - related debt .

In the latest update on the average paid attendance figures for the Nashville Predators , John Glennon reports that after 29 home games , the Preds now stand at 13,793 ( up from 13,511 about a month ago ) .
Somebody make sure these figures get to " Rusty " Lawrence ahead of tomorrow 's meeting of the Sports Authority , okay ?
The Preds are currently enjoying the typical post - football season boost to their ticket sales , and are making progress towards the critical 14,000 milestone which represents a pre-condition for receiving full NHL revenue sharing under the Collective Bargaining Agreement .
One thing to keep in mind , however , is that hitting the 14 K benchmark does n't necessarily mean the team will qualify for full NHL revenue sharing , and they 've still got plenty of work to do down the stretch ...
The Predators continue their home schedule after the Olympic break with 10 home games in the month of March .
For discount tickets to any Nashville Predators home game , follow this link and use the special offer code " PREDS " .
What 's At Stake
Nashville 's ability to meet these conditions is often seen as putting the team at risk of not receiving upwards of $ 10 million in NHL revenue sharing if they miss the target .
Since a total loss of $ 20 million , combined with paid attendance below 14,000 , can trigger an escape of the arena lease , this causes some observers to surmise that the Predators could move out of town as soon as this summer .
A critical point that is often misunderstood , however , is that under the CBA , a team that misses the performance targets would only lose 25 % of their share , so the stakes involved are more like $ 2 - 4 million .
Since the team has come close to breaking even the last two seasons , and has kept payroll low this year , it remains absurdly unlikely that the $ 20 million net loss figure is on the horizon .
So forget the relocation talk , and focus on what 's really on the line : somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 2 - 4 million in revenue sharing .
The Good News
As noted above , paid attendance is on the rise , and if they merely average 14,500 the rest of the way , the Preds will hit the 14 K mark .
Their last 5 home games have averaged 15,146 , and with a playoff drive coming up which includes a heavy dose of Thursday / Saturday games , all signs are positive that they 'll achieve that goal .
If the team averages 15,146 the rest of the way ( as they have over the last home stand ) , they 'll end up with the same overall total as last season ( 14,190 ) .
So there 's also a chance they could make year - over - year progress in terms of tickets sold .
The Bad News
There is another criterion that must be met for a team to receive a full portion of revenue sharing , however .
This comes from Article 49 of the CBA :
The Club is generating a year - to - year revenue growth rate in excess of the League average revenue growth rate ( i.e. , the Club 's revenue growth rate from the previous League Year to the current League Year is greater than the League average revenue growth rate from the previous League Year to the current League Year ) ;
In short , the team 's revenue growth rate has to exceed the league average , and this is where the Predators could run into trouble .
All indications so far is that the League 's average revenue growth will be pretty flat , balancing out the general economic situation against the runup in the Canadian dollar ( since all revenues are measured in USD , appreciation of the Loonie directly inflates the revenue of the Canadian teams as expressed in league figures , and thus the NHL as a whole ) .
Based on detailed information that I requested from the Metro Sports Authority that covers the first 23 home games , however , it appears that both gross and net sales ( before and after ticket - based taxes paid to the city of Nashville ) resulting from these paid attendance figures are running about 10 % lower than last season , which could , if continued , result in a drop of $ 2 - 3 million in ticket sales .
Whether this is the result of discounting , or a change in the mix of tickets being sold ( lower vs. upper bowl ) is impossible to say .
It should also be noted that there are other revenue streams that could theoretically make up for this gap ; corporate sponsorships , stronger ticket sales in the coming weeks , etc .
But the likelihood is that top - line revenue dollars during the regular season will decline from last season , putting the team at risk of missing the aforementioned 25 % of NHL revenue sharing .
The Road Ahead
So if the Predators are in danger of bringing in $ 2 - 3 million less at the gate , and could miss out on a further $ 2 - 4 million in revenue sharing , are they doomed financially ?
Hardly .
As mentioned previously , other revenue streams could help alleviate the ticket - selling shortfall , and the rumored upcoming partnership with Bridgestone could present a major step along that road .
A single playoff round ( 3 home games ) would also close most or all of that financial gap , and anything further would not just push this season 's figures into the black , but also build momentum for next year with both individual and corporate sales .
The playoffs are a major profit generator for NHL teams , because player salaries have already been paid out over the course of the regular season , while gate revenues are typically very high as teams sellout the games at what are often premium prices .
As always , it comes down to the Stanley Cup playoffs .
Making them , and making noise once they get there , is of critical importance to the Nashville Predators and their fans .
The Nashville Predators reviewed this article prior to publication and declined to confirm or deny the details presented above .
You'd think that somebody with a direct line to the Almighty , and tapped by Jesus to save mankind on Earth , would be able to come up with a better business plan for running a daily newspaper .
But , alas , after nearly three decades of unrelenting financial losses , the Rev. Sun Myung Moon , a federal tax cheat , accused cult leader , and founder of the Unification Church , has decided to pull out .
Actually , according to news reports , it 's more like Moon 's U.S. college - educated sons , as part of an internal family power struggle , have decided to finally cut off the endless stream of Asian church cash that 's kept the Times afloat .
With the announcement that 40 percent of the Times ' staff is getting pink - slipped , and that the daily 's no longer even going to bother with traditional who / what / where / when / why reporting , instead publishing an opinion - heavy publication that will be free of charge at a diminished number of local outlets , Times owners look like they 're angling to be a Weekly Standard wannabe , churning out lots of predictable GOP Noise Machine opinion prattle .
( Paging Andrew Breirtbart ! )
What is clear is that the daily 's days as a functioning newspaper are now over .
R.I.P. The Washington Times .
At this time of reflection , it 's worth pondering two rather astonishing facets about the Times and its bizarre life and looming death .
The first is the deep irony of how the Times , a clarion voice
of partisan right - wing values , was run as a charity for nearly three decades and whose business model made a mockery of the free - marketplace system supposedly cherished by conservatives .
The second is the even deeper irony of how the Times was owned by a delusional prophet whose apocalyptic visions made an even bigger mockery of the Christian values supposedly cherished by conservative activists .
Indeed , the woeful Times has for decades stood at the center of a Beltway marriage - of - convenience for the ages , as conservatives nearly developed cataracts turning a collective blind eye to the glaringly obvious contradictions that Moon 's worldview created with conservatives .
( FYI , Moon proclaims to be more powerful than God , that Jesus was a failure , and that dictatorial rule is best .
Hmm .....)
The failed Times venture was nonetheless a shining example of how conservative ideologues view journalism .
To them , it 's not a craft to be used for public good ( or even to make money , as it turns out ) , but a tool to be used for mainly propaganda purposes .
And specifically , in Moon 's case , it was used to impress his friends back in Seoul , South Korea , and to inflate the influence of his Unification Church .
The messianic Moon , who has referred to himself as " humanity 's Savior , " never cared about journalism in the traditional , American , free - marketplace sense of the word .
Yes , he launched a product that looked like a newspaper , but its central goal was never really to inform its readers .
Its goal seemed more often to misinform and to enhance Moon 's reputation outside the United States .
Moon and Unification Church leaders used the newspaper as a symbol , most often in Asia , to suggest that Moon moved freely among world leaders .
That the newspaper in 2009 had a modest circulation roughly matching that of the Chattanooga Times Free Press was irrelevant to the paper 's publishers , although the newspaper 's evaporating readership probably was not lost on the Times ' shrinking band of local advertisers .
Now , I 'm not a press hater .
And unlike conservative media critics , I do n't take pleasure in watching news orgs struggle financially .
I do n't relish a world with fewer hard - working journalists .
( I think democracies are best served with more journalists . )
But I am hard - pressed to think of one thing that will be missed about the Times .
Indeed , the problem most recently was n't that the Times was a Moonie newspaper , per se ; it was that the Times became a chronically dishonest , and often proudly hateful , one .
Indeed , the Moonie connection over time became largely irrelevant , in part because the Unification Church today barely even exists as a religious entity in America .
( Experts suggest the movement boasts less than 5,000 members nationwide . )
The real problem , and the real damage the daily was doing to public discourse , was that the Times , like the rest of the right - wing movement post - Obama Inauguration Day , ran off the rails in 2009 .
And much like Fox News , it cut whatever ceremonial newsroom ties it still had with actual journalism .
I 'm tempted to call the Times a failed news experiment .
But it seems obvious that Moon knew it was going to fail financially , so it was n't really an experiment .
In other words , Moon may be the only big -city publisher in American history who set out to launch a money - losing newspaper ; the only big -city American publisher who honestly did not care , nor did he ever expect , his newspaper to turn a profit -- or even come close .
Moon and the Times ' parent company never open their books , but it 's been estimated the self - proclaimed messiah has spent nearly $ 3 billion propping up the right - wing daily since its inception in 1982 .
As the paper now implodes , Moon is certainly the proud owner of the most expensive failed newspaper in the world , and it 's possible that the Times stands as the most expensive failed American news property .
Ever .
The irony , of course , is that the American conservative movement proudly -- and loudly -- worships at the altar of the marketplace .
( No handouts ! )
And specifically when it comes to the media marketplace , the movement insists newspapers can no longer sustain themselves , in part , because they 're so liberal that they 've lost touch with news consumers , and that 's why subscribers are abandoning the dailies .
And that 's why the dailies deserve to fail .
But oops , The Washington Times ( not to mention the right - wing New York Post ) has been losing subscribers by the tens - of - thousands in recent years , and if ever left strictly to the beloved marketplace , the Times would have been shuttered years ago for the simple reason that ( surprise ! ) there is no mass market demand for the often shoddy right - wing product .
As a for - profit business , The Washington Times could never sustain itself .
Period .
So instead , its right - wing ideologue owner supported the daily as a form of conservative welfare -- as a charity .
The Times was run for decades as sort of right - wing workfare project as Moon created hundreds of unneeded newsroom jobs , paid for in the name of giving its owner a ( money - losing ) media platform .
Of course the other glaring disconnect ( or blatant hypocrisy , if you prefer ) was the way the strongly Evangelical - flavored conservative movement embraced a free - spending media baron who , thanks to his own fantastic claims of divinity and looming world domination , made a mockery out of Christian traditions .
Behold :
I am God 's ambassador , sent to earth with his full authority .
I am sent to accomplish his command to save the world 's six billion people , restoring them to heaven with the original goodness in which they were created .
The five great saints and many other leaders in the spirit world , including even Communist leaders such as Marx and Lenin , who committed all manner of barbarity and murders on earth , and dictators such as Hitler and Stalin , have found strength in my teachings , mended their ways , and been reborn as new persons .
For those who might not know , the Korean - born Moon claims that at the age of 16 , Jesus appeared to him in the mountains , on an Easter Sunday , and told him he'd been selected by God to accomplish the mission Jesus himself was unable to complete before he was crucified .
Moon 's task as God 's new Messiah was to create " an " automatic theocracy to rule the world . " ( aka the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth . )
Yikes .
And as former Unification Church official Michael Warder once told The New Republic , " Within the Moon movement , there is no foundation for the ideas of freedom , the rule of law and the dignity of the individual as they are understood in the West . "
Double yikes .
Recall that a 1978 congressional investigation reported " reliable information " tying Moon 's church to the Korean Central Intelligence Agency .
Triple yikes .
And do n't forget that Moon was convicted of falsifying records in order to avoid paying income taxes .
Quadruple yikes .
And this :
Moon claims to have communicated with God , Jesus , Buddha , and Mohammed .
Moon also claims to have freed Adolf Hitler from hell , and that 36 former U.S. presidents have all endorsed him from beyond the grave .
What that kind of brazen nuttiness ever had to do with conservative values remains a mystery .
But the Moonie checks were cashed all over town as Beltway conservative activists embraced Moon and his largesse , which for decades poured into right - wing think tanks .
It paid for elaborate anti-communism conferences ; it lined the pockets of high - profile guest speakers ; and of course sustained a newspaper that could not otherwise sustain itself .
It kept alive a newspaper that utterly failed in the marketplace .
And no , I can't say I 'm going to miss The Washington Times .

The plane was met by police and FBI agents
A US Airways flight was diverted to Philadelphia after a young Jewish man 's prayer items triggered a bomb scare , Philadelphia police said .
The incident arose when the man used a phylactery , a small black box Orthodox Jews strap to their head as part of their prayer rituals , police said .
The man was not arrested and the plane landed without incident .
US airports are on high alert after a Nigerian man was held over an alleged bomb plot on a plane last month .
His device allegedly malfunctioned and he was quickly overpowered by passengers and crew on the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit .
The latest incident took place on a 50 - seat regional jet originally bound for Louisville , Kentucky from New York 's LaGuardia airport .
It landed in Philadelphia at about 0900 local time ( 1400 GMT ) .
Phylacteries - called tefillin in Hebrew - are two small boxes of black leather , with straps attached to them .
Observant Jewish men are required to place one box on their head and tie the other one on their arm as part of their morning prayers .

DETROIT — Automakers at the North American International
Show are wiping their brows with relief , calling 2009 the industry ’s worst year in memory .
They ’re eagerly anticipating a slight market recovery — 11.5 million units , by most estimates — in 2010 .
Some are even optimistic beyond the numbers .
Don Esmond , senior vice president of Toyota USA , compared 2009 to a " good Midwestern ice storm — it ’ll trim the trees and they ’ll come back stronger . "
And for the auto industry , a big measure of that strength — or at least show of strength — is the unveiling of new products .

What Your Car Says About You
We spent several hours on the floor of the auto show examining vehicles and interviewing automakers about what they have slated for 2010 and beyond to determine which vehicles are the hottest newcomers to Detroit this year .
Volkswagen AG will offer 60 new and refreshed models globally across its brands this year ; Nissan will bring eight new cars to market in the next 12 months , including the electric LEAF .
In the U.S. , Toyota has committed to bring a mass - marketed , plug - in Prius to showrooms in 2012 — which will compete with GM ’s plug - in Chevrolet Volt , slated to go on sale later this year .
Higher up in the price spectrum , Mercedes - Benz is debuting its E - Class convertible , BMW is unveiling its BMW Z4 sDrive35i , and Cadillac is showing the coupe version of the high - performance CTS - V this week .
What pricier models such as these tend to lack when it comes to bolstering global sales for the automakers , they make up for in fostering a strong brand .
" This is still an emotional business , " says Ernst Leib , CEO of Mercedes - Benz North America .
" When this show opens to the public , where will they stand ? "
Detroit Muscle
Needless to say , when the show opens to the public Saturday auto - show visitors will crowd around and photograph the hottest cars they can find , like Mercedes ’ new SLS AMG , complete with gull - wing doors , and Bentley ’s $ 285,000 Mulsanne .
The CTS - V coupe — the price is likely to be close to the sedan ’s $ 62,020 — is a key car for Cadillac , arguably the strongest of GM ’s four remaining brands ( 2009 saw the shelving or sale of Pontiac , Hummer , Saturn and Saab ) .
The CTS was a top - seller for GM last year , and all predictions are that the company ’s 556 - horsepower , two - door sidekick will hold its on own the showroom floor — as well as on the road .
To prove that point , GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz even challenged reporters to a time trial last fall , in which they could race any comparable vehicle against the CTS - V .
( Lutz did n’t record the fastest time of the day , but a professional driver handling a CTS - V did . )
The coupe is shorter and sits slightly lower than the sedan .
It comes with magnetic ride control suspension and Brembo brakes , not to mention a choice of two six - speed transmissions : a dual - disc clutch Tremec TR6060 manual and a Hydra - Matic 6L90 automatic with paddle shifters .
With a supercharged V8 engine , it ’ll leave quite an impression .
Another pair of muscle - bound machines will hit the ground in early 2010 as well : the Ford Mustang GT 5.0 - liter V8 and the Chevrolet Camaro convertible .
First , the Ford :
Its new engine may not sound like much , but it ’s actually a big step forward for the classic pony .
With 412 horsepower , Brembo disc brakes and optional six - speed manual transmission , it ’ll blow past the 305 - horsepower V6 version shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show last month .
The Camaro convertible , on the other hand , will likely match the specs of its hard - top counterpart : a V6 or V8 engine with 304 to 426 horsepower , 18 - inch heritage steel wheels , polished exhaust tips , leather seats and a rear spoiler — not to mention that unmistakable Camaro rumble .
It ’s slated as a 2012 model but will likely start production in early 2011 .
Honda ’s Hot Hybrid
Honda ’s new coupe is designed to break ground among that same enthusiastic driving set .
Rather than other hybrids ( the family sedan or soccer - mom SUV with a " hybrid " badge on it ) , the CR - Z Sport Hybrid is designed primarily for driving enjoyment , Honda says .
The car comes with a Civic - inspired 140 - horsepower , 1.8 - liter engine , three - mode drive system and optional manual gearbox .
While the motor , battery and electronics — not to mention the platform itself — will be the same as the Honda Insight hybrid , the new car will be smaller , making for a more fun , spirited ride .
Unsuspecting drivers likely wo n’t be able to tell they ’re in a hybrid when they slip into the front seat , either .
The aerodynamic shape , paddle - shifters , illuminated three - dimensional gauges and black and aluminum trim are all designed to appeal to those for whom green driving is n’t necessarily front - of - mind .
The CR - Z Sport would seem to fit into Honda ’s philosophy .
" Our ultimate goal is not to achieve No. 1 market share , " says CEO Takanubo Ito .
" Our goal is to manufacture products which make our customers happy . "
We ’ll know by next year ’s auto show whether such a strategy pays off .
We 've already given you the leaked specs for the unannounced updates to Sony 's VAIO Z series of laptops .
Now here 's what you have n't heard : that SSD on the feature list is rather special , a " Quad SSD " in Sony language .
To quote from the materials we 've peeped , the Quad SSD is delineated as " SSD RAID0:64GB/128 GB x 4 . "
What 's unclear is whether that means 4 x 128 GB or 64GB modules for either 512GB or 256GB of RAID 0 storage , or simply 4 x flash modules totaling 128 GB or 64GB of RAID 0 capacity .
Presumably , it 's similar to devices like the PhotoFast GMonster Quad Drive ( pictured , with four CF memory cards ) that we 've already seen .
What we do know for sure , however , is that Sony 's Quad SSD features incredible throughput compared to a traditional 5400rpm hard disk .
We 're talking about writing a 1GB file at about 4 seconds compared to 25 seconds on that same 5400rpm spinner .
We 're also told that the VAIO Z will be the first to feature a backlit keyboard , something we 've been missing from Sony 's previous generation of Zs .
It 's CES kids so the truth is only hours away .

There 's only one semi-sexy scene in James Cameron 's blockbuster " Avatar , " but what could n't be shown in theaters you 'll be able to watch in the privacy of your own home .
Cameron admitted in a recent group interview that " Avatar " did have a sex scene between Zoe Saldana 's Neytiri , a Na’vi , and the avatar of Sam Worthington 's character , Jake Sully , but he cut it out in favor of a PG - 13 rating .
" That [ scene ] will be something for the special edition DVD , if you want to see how they have sex , " Cameron said .
( If you have n't seen the movie and absolutely detest spoilers , stop reading now . )
Instead of doing more R- rated moves , the two blue aliens spend a few sultry minutes intensely staring and sharing a Hollywood kiss before the film jumps to the morning after .
The scene could leave some people scratching their heads , since it 's unclear how , exactly , the Na'vi mate .
The aliens wear clothing in the same areas humans do when hitting a public beach , but they could be as anatomically correct as Barbie and Ken dolls .
And where do those tails go ?
For the last question , at least , Saldana had a probable answer .
" If you sync to your banshee and you 're syncing to a tree , why not sync into a person ?
I almost feel like you 'll have the most amazing orgasm , I guess , " she said in the interview .
" It was a very funny scene to shoot because there were so many technical things that sometimes you have to keep in mind that paying attention to all those might disrupt the fluidity of how a scene is supposed to take place . "
She added that because Cameron wanted to keep a tween - friendly rating , they " could n't move in certain directions .
The motion would look a little too past the PG - 13 rating standards .
So it was really funny for Sam and me .
We had a lot of giggles there . "
Here 's hoping that extra DVD scene will be just as hilarious .
Anyone who ’s seen Mike Tyson fight is aware of the benefits a violent childhood can bring .
You don ” t have to condone kids getting beat up every day to enjoy seeing him in the ring .
You don ” t want your children to follow the same path , but as far as Tyson ’s shitty life goes , there ’s no better job .
Not just anybody can step in the ring .
Athletic commissions regulate boxing licenses and make sure things don” t get too gory .
Tyson himself had his license rescinded in 1997 after biting off his opponent ’s ear .
This is the way it should be .
Boxing is a violent sport that can do serious , permanent damage .
I have never been the same after challenging a professional MMA fighter to a fight .
I didn ” t have the experience to handle the guy and ended up in the hospital with cerebral contusions .
I ” ll never do that again .
Pornography is exactly the same .
I love watching porn stars like Ava Devine get violated , but I ” m well aware the odds of her having been sexual abused as a child are about 99.99 percent .
You don ” t have to condone sexual abuse to watch porn .
It ’s a great job for someone who is dumb , unambitious , and devoid of sexuality .
In fact , the only way you can do “ sex work ”  ( as naÃ¯ve feminists like to call it ) is to have no sex left in you .
Some perverted uncle or disgusting friend of the family robs a girl of her most intimate and valuable asset and it ’s like a light switch goes off .
Now they can have sex with anyone because they ’re numb .
I ” ve talked to a lot of strippers and prostitutes about this phenomenon and have yet to meet one who denied the vast majority of people who have sex for money are abuse victims .
An ex-prostitute I dated for a while made it all too clear .
“  Sex isn ” t the same thing to me as it is to you , ”  she said .
“  To me it ’s like playing soccer or swimming . ” 
I spent about half the relationship thinking of all the different ways I was going to kill her dad for what he did to her .
This obsession eventually ended the relationship .
There is no athletic commission to regulate who goes into porn and ensure no fragile eggs get trampled .
The very nature of the business has always kept the innocent away .
Until now .
Until hipster porn :
Also called alt porn , it ’s a genre of pornography that is mostly pictures on websites but also includes actual pornographic videos .
Hipster porn stars tend to be middle - class punk girls who come from pretty stable backgrounds and have been convinced what they ” re doing isn ” t porn at all and therefore doesn ” t deserve a lot of money .
These girls haven ” t been molested as kids and are in way over their heads .
This sexist plague began with Scene Queens : Young , punk girls on social networks who put up titillating pictures of themselves for free .
They get thousands of friends and often correspond with them online .
I ” d never allow my daughter to do this , but it ’s not the end of the world .
I don” t even think I ” d call it misogynist .
Unfortunately , once this became cool , a new wave of pornography took hold .
Websites like Suicide Girls ( the Playboy of the genre ) and Burning Angel ( the very NSFW version ) popped up and convinced even MORE girls it was hip to pose nude for next to nothing .
They weren ” t porn stars , they were “ pin - ups ”  , and the whole thing was lumped in with Roller Derby and Burlesque as a fun and empowering way to show your Girl Power .
Pornographic video jumped on the bandwagon and guys like Eon McKai ( named after the singer of a punk band from the 80s ) has convinced a whole new generation of girls porn isn ” t porn .
But it is porn .
And porn is supposed to pay .
Real porn stars hate hipster porn because they see it as rich kids devaluing the sex dollar for laughs .
You ” re not supposed to get $ 100 to have sex on camera .
You ” re supposed to get $ 1,500 .
These girls are stepping into the ring with Mike Tyson and getting knocked out for free again and again .
When the religious right rails against pornography and portrays it as male predators taking advantage of vulnerable women , I roll my eyes .
Porn is simply victims of abuse making the best of a terrible situation .
Porn producers aren ” t predators .
They ” re entrepreneurs .
However , Pat Robertson is correct when it comes to hipster porn .
The men who make money off this new breed of porn star are exactly the predator the religious right say he is .
In my twenties , I lived with two punk chicks who were lazy and wanted a job where they didn ” t have to leave the house .
They chose phone sex .
Neither of these girls were molested as kids and despite the tattoos and pink hair , ultimately just wanted a nice boyfriend whom they would eventually marry and make babies with .
Guess what happened .
The job rotted them .
I would come home after a hard day ’s work and feel glares burning through the back of my head .
I would turn around and find them staring at me like I habitually raped them both .
“  That job made me hate men , ”  one of them admitted to me years after quitting .
“  It messes with your head . ” 
Their boss eventually convinced one of them to go to hotels and urinate on perverts for money .
She recently described the experience as “ damaging ” — though she ” d never have admitted it back then .
I ” ve always said this kind of pornography is not cool , but it ’s hard to prove something is damaging in the long run when it ’s only been around for a few years .
A few months ago , I was interviewed at dinner along with some other media types including a blogger / hipster porn star who called herself Baby Sinead .
She told me her parents were totally cool with her doing pornography .
I did my best to explain to her that her sexuality is actually very sacred and not something to be tossed around willy nilly .
That ’s why people pay so much for it .
It has value .
Lawsuits that include “ violating a woman ’s chastity ”  are a very big deal because the courts understand a woman unanimously seen as a slut is in for a lonely life .
Now , if someone already took your chastity and threw it in the garbage , selling it isn ” t such a big deal .
She doesn ” t fall into that category but I couldn ” t convince her it mattered .
“  Take what ’s left of your innocence and get out while you can , ”  I pleaded with her .
“  This job will ruin your life . ” 
The eponymous Baby looked at me like I just told her Dick Cheney is sexy .
In about ten years , when she ’s a lonely cougar , she ” ll realize I was right but by then it will be too late .
Cougar isn” t a good thing by the way .
That ’s another lie women are told .
China on Monday dismissed accusations of any official involvement in hacking attacks on Google and other U.S. companies , adding to tension between the two countries over the issue .
A Chinese official also defended online censorship of political topics and said the country would not change how it regulates the Internet , according to the official Xinhua news agency .
Google has said it was hit by cyberattacks from China that caused the loss of intellectual property and were also aimed at accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists .
Google cited the attacks , which hit at least 20 other large U.S. companies , as one reason it plans to stop censoring its Chinese search engine , even if that means closing its China offices .
Google did not blame the Chinese government for the attacks , but U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called on China to investigate the claims .
" Whether through explicit or implicit means , criticizing ' Chinese government participation in hacking attacks ' is totally baseless , " China 's official Xinhua news agency cited a spokesperson for China 's IT ministry as saying .
" We resolutely oppose this . "
The Xinhua article quoting the ministry official was posted on the ministry 's Web site .
The official repeated previous government statements that Chinese law forbids hacking attacks and that the country is open to international cooperation to fight cybercrime .
A spokesperson for China 's State Council said the country 's laws protect freedom of speech online but also forbid use of the Internet for acts such as subverting the government , destroying national unity or spreading porn or violent content , according to a separate Xinhua report .
" China 's handling of this harmful information according to the law has a full legal basis , and without a doubt is a totally separate issue from so - called ' restrictions on Internet freedom , ' " the official was quoted as saying .
" We will steadfastly walk the path of Internet development and oversight with Chinese characteristics . "
China 's foreign ministry last week said Clinton had harmed U.S. - China relations by urging Internet freedom in countries including China .
China requires the local search engines of Google and other companies to remove certain sensitive items from search results , including porn and political content such as information about the 1989 democracy protests in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square .
Local authorities also patrol the Web for such content and sometimes punish Internet companies that allow it to appear on their sites , including on user - generated pages such as blogs .
Google is still censoring search results on its Chinese search engine , but company CEO Eric Schmidt last week said that could change soon .
So long as I ’m harping on desktops for Pentium - era machines running Debian , I might as well give a run-down on what I personally would ( and sometimes do ) use .
Provided you ’re not going to dedicate the machine to a singular task and imprison it in the closet , this might actually make a machine usable for you , all the way down to around 100 Mhz .
Which release you use is up to you , since it does n’t really affect anything except the version of the application … or whether an application is available at all .
In that sense , I make no endorsement except perhaps to say that working out of testing is not all it ’s cracked up to be .
Yes , it ’s as close to a rolling - release Debian as you ’ll get , but the things I use still seem a step behind Arch or for that matter Crux .
The same ground rule applies as ever :
If you want stable reliable software you follow Debian ’s style , and if you want something cutting edge you move out into the wilderness .
Do n’t be shy .
Jump in with both feet .
First on the list and probably the most important , is to pick out a console font that makes your eye happy and uses screen space efficiently .
Provided you have the framebuffer working on your computer ( and if Debian can handle the framebuffer on this ancient , eccentric machine , it can probably handle yours too ) , I recommend something like the Terminus font .
It ’s strictly a matter of preference though .
After that , I would recommend screen , except that the Debian version does two things I find less - than - enjoyable .
For one , it includes a single - character - width bar between vertical panels , which eats screen space and serves no purpose .
Second , it always redistributes the screen space evenly , which I do n’t want .
I want to be able to adjust individual frames to suit the application I ’m running .
For those reasons I recommend rebuilding screen from scratch and patching it manually .
The directions here are aimed at Ubuntu but will work with Debian too ; there may be minor differences in packaging versions but it worked fine for me and compiled in a reasonable amount of time at 120 Mhz .
On top of that , and this might sound somewhat unusual , but I recommend installing dvtm as well .
Why ?
Is n’t that hypocritical since you just knocked Debian ’s screen for including a vertical divider ?
Maybe yes , but I say that mostly because screen and dvtm complement each other quite nicely .
I would like to be able to group frames in screen and pop them in and out , but that ’s not really possible .
At the same time , once something is running in a dvtm window , it ’s a bit awkward to shuffle around .
By combining them both , you can do things like paste htop and iftop in a pair of horizontally arranged windows in dvtm in one screen frame , label them “ monitors ” and bounce in and out any time you need a system or network profile .
Purists will say that screen and dvtm are two sides of the same coin , but using them both in conjunction gives you a different and innovative way of managing parts of your workload .
It might be best to tackle the biggest issue up front :
So long as you have a working framebuffer you have the ability to use links2 as a browser , and get a satisfactory graphical experience from an otherwise console - based experience .
Test runs at 120 Mhz suggest this is a clean and brisk way to browse without overburdening the machine to a point of unusability .
Firefox with Flash it is not , but if you are an unbeliever and demand a graphical browser on a Pentium Pro , this will satisfy .
Furthermore , adding fbi to your system brings along fbgs , which allows you to display images and pdf files , respectively .
For the reverse , try fbgrab and share your desktops with the world .
Before this turns into a list of random framebuffer - based applications , I ’ll stop and say that my own personal preference is for the terminal - based applications listed here , supplemented with a few from here .
Not everything listed is included in the Debian repos , but what is n’t there is usually small enough to compile at a low clock speed without waiting a week .
The converse of that is true though too — there are quite a few applications in the repos that I do n’t even consider for my day to day patterns of use .
Look into fbset for unusual terminal dimensions or rotated displays , jfbterm or fbiterm for an international terminal emulator , or some others .
I have a feeling my Debian adventure is drawing to a close , but I have no doubts I ’ll be putting it back on this machine .
I have a few more stops before that though . 😉
In last week 's Film & Music , the Guardian heaped praise upon Spoon 's seventh album , saying that the Austin alt - rockers " reshuffle their pack so skilfully that the same cards – guitar , bass , drums and keyboards – produce an array of different hands " .
But why take our word for it ?
Well , because we 're trained critics with sharp musical brains , of course .
But just in case you want to test it for yourself , we 've teamed up with free music - streaming service We7.com
to provide this exclusive first listen to Spoon 's Transference .
Let us know what you think in the comments below .
I will limit my comments in this post since I am so thoroughly disgusted with Washington ’s giveaways to special interests .
But I have to bring up health care reform and its likely non-impact on improving American ’s economic situation in this time of economic insecurity .
I have argued in the past that it is a moral question for a 21st century developed country whether it wants to extend health care insurance to all of its citizens .
There are plenty of market - friendly options like Ross Douthat ’s that we could have chosen .
I am not pushing for so - called ‘ Obamacare ’ or the public option – though public healthcare insurance works fine in the countries in which I have lived .
What I want , at a minimum , is basic maintenance and emergency coverage because this reduces costs by encouraging people to visit a doctor and remain healthy .
It also lowers costs by preventing the costs of the uninsured from being borne by the insured as mandated auto insurance does .
In July , I said this is the true purpose of health care reform .
Now , in the 21st century , more than 230 years after our first Independence Day , is n’t it time that access to insured basic preventive and emergency health care get added to this list ?
I am not saying that all American residents must have comprehensive coverage .
What I am saying is this : it is utterly deplorable that the richest nation in the world could allow millions of its own citizens and residents not to have insurance against basic health care needs .
You must question the value system of a nation which allows many of its residents to be bankrupted in order to get healthy .
But , the Senate health care reform bill does not change this because , as usual , lobbyists have pressured congress to insert pro-special interest language into the bill .
The Washington Post ’s Michael Gerson says :
It is symbolic of the Senate ’s health - care bill that the section titled " No lifetime or annual limits " would allow insurance companies to impose annual dollar limits on medical care — meaning that patients in need of expensive cancer treatment , for example , could still be bankrupted .
Democratic health reform legislation promises everything to everyone while imposing a series of hidden burdens to make a massive new entitlement affordable , at least on paper .
So its authors are in a game of beat the clock :
Pass the legislation before those burdens are fully disclosed to the public .
The case of annual dollar limits — now being renegotiated after they were noticed — is instructive .
In the " reformed " insurance system , every plan would be a high - end plan , requiring insurance companies to cover people who are already sick and limiting the ability to charge higher premiums for those at higher risk .
To avoid going out of business or dramatically increasing premiums across the board , insurance companies want the ability to cap yearly benefits .
The Senate bill included this limit , because higher premiums would require greater government subsidies to help people afford them .
Cutting off cancer patients helps Congress meet its budget target .
Did you get that ?
You can still be bankrupted in America by medical costs even after this bill passes .
No other major developed country allows this .
( Update : I forgot ; it ’s because no other country believes in freedom and individual rights . )
It is a travesty and shows a let them eat cake wantonness at the core of America ’s ethos .
But this is where we are .
In an effort to pass anything to ‘ save Obama ’s Presidency ’ , the Senate Democrats are going to let this toothless bill pass , insurance giveaways and all .
Howard Dean had it right on ABC when he said the health care bill was a “ bigger bailout for the insurance industry than AIG ’ .
Watch that clip .
People can demagogue this issue all they want , but healthcare insurance insiders are bragging and claiming victory in e-mails .
This bill does not increase economic security for Americans and it does not cut health care costs .
It does gift insurance companies millions of new customers .
Pathetic .

I was wondering if there was a way for the Mac to automatically clear the desktop and put all the items into the documents folder when shutting down .
I 'm setting up a computer which has a lot of users and clutter on the desktop is an issue .
Thanks .
This is a great example of when AppleScript is really useful for automating simple tasks like moving files around .
In fact , you can do it with a script that is only three lines long .
Start by opening up AppleScript Editor , located in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder .
If you do n't have Snow Leopard , the latest version of Mac OS X , this might be called Script Editor and instead is located in the AppleScript folder in the Applications folder .
In the window that appears , paste the following three lines :
tell application " Finder " move items of ( path to desktop folder ) to folder ( path to documents folder ) end tell
If you click Run , you should see all the items on your desktop move into your Documents folder .
Choose Save
As from the File menu , give the script a name like cleardesktop and change the File Format to Application .
Save it somewhere safe where someone wo n't accidentally delete it .
I have a folder inside my Documents folder called Scripts where I keep all my AppleScripts .
Other people choose to store their scripts in the Scripts folder in the Library folder , because Apple has already put some ready made ones in there .
The next step is to make it run every time you shut down your Mac .
This is pretty tricky to do , and involves using a lot of Terminal commands .
Instead , a much easier way is to make the script run when you log in , which will essentially do the same thing .
Just go to System Preferences , and click on the Accounts section .
Choose your account from the list on the left , and then click on the Login Items tab .
You can now either click the plus (+ ) button and locate your script , or just drag the script from a Finder window into the list .
Now , whenever you turn on your computer , all the clutter left over from the previous user will be automatically moved into the Documents folder .
The above script is just about as basic as you can get .
Here ’s an idea for a more complicated version .
Instead of just dumping everything in your documents folder , it instead creates a folder in there with a name that includes todays date ( e.g. “ Desktop 13/01/2010 ” ) and puts the items in this folder instead .
set foldername to ( " Desktop " & short date string of ( current date ) ) set docsfolder to ( path to documents folder ) as string tell application " Finder " if not ( exists folder ( docsfolder & foldername ) ) then make new folder at docsfolder with properties { name : foldername } end if move items of ( path to desktop folder ) to folder ( docsfolder & foldername ) end tell
Alternatively , the following script checks the file extension of all the files on the desktop , and sorts them into the Movies , Pictures , Applications and Documents folders depending on what they are .
If you are feeling adventurous , you can modify the script to include your own folders and file extensions .
You ’re not fooling him , sister .
It ’s a pairing more common than takeout Caesar salad and two buck Chuck .
There ’s even a song about it : you ’re a vegetarian and your boyfriend is n’t about to part with bacon in this lifetime .
It ’s not that he hates the planet ; it ’s just that tofu deeply worries him .
The mere mention of a vegetarian dinner brings your old nickname ( Chick ’n ) back to life for at least a week , or on more exciting nights , a spirited debate about whether mock meat nuggets taste more like chicken nuggets than actual chicken nuggets .
I ’ll save you the suspense : nobody wins .
Help your manly meatatarian out with some veg recipes that he ’ll actually love .
That means filling , substantial , tasty and preferably hand - held .
These recipes are fast , cheap , and easy .
Something every man appreciates .
1. The Carl ’s Jr. Is Scared of This Sandwich , Sandwich
This is a sandwich everyone loves , and the ingredients are so filling no one notices the lack of meat .
The best part is that it only takes 10 minutes to make .
Note : this is not a sandwich for someone on a diet .
Ingredients : sourdough or rye bread , 1 large avocado , 4 slices sharp cheddar and 2 slices gruyere cheese , 1 tomato .
To make : this is just like a grilled cheese sandwich , except you ’re also adding in avocado slices ( half an avocado for each sandwich ) and tomato slices ( ditto ) .
Each sandwich gets 3 slices of cheese .
To make the sandwich really good and greasy – but somewhat healthy – skip butter and lightly coat both sides of each piece of bread in olive oil .
Give the oiled bread a tasty treatment of coarse salt and , if you have it , a tiny sprinkling of chopped rosemary .
Trust me , this is insanely filling – and good .
To rev it up a bit , shake a little Tabasco over the sandwiches while they ’re grilling .
2. The Chop
My grandmother learned this recipe while living in Guinea , Africa .
Over the years everyone in the family has adapted it in different ways .
She always called it Chop , and while her recipe used ground beef and beef broth , you do n’t need the meat and you can use vegetable stock .
Ingredients : 1/2 cup red wine ( cheap is fine ) , 1 cup tomato paste , 2 cups chopped tomatoes , 1 / 2 cup peanut butter , 2 tablespoons olive oil , a few pinches of salt , a handful of chopped oregano ( or marjoram ) , a few dashes of Tabasco , and 1 / 2 cup vegetable broth .
If desired , use 1/ 2 cup of peanuts or 1 can of chickpeas as a meat substitute .
To make : combine everything in a large sauce pot , stir , and simmer on medium - low for at least an hour ( it ’s best if you can let it simmer for 2 or 3 hours to help the flavors blend ) .
This is not unlike spaghetti sauce , but the peanut butter gives it more of an exotic flavor – and makes the sauce more substantial .
Serve over brown rice .
If you want this really chunky and thick , use more peanut butter .
You can also include a chopped white or yellow onion and a few fresh minced garlic cloves in the sauce .
3. King Burrito
Men like holding their food .
Ingredients : 2 very large soft flour tortillas , 1 can vegetarian refried beans , 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese , 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese , 1 small diced white onion , 2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce , 1 cup leftover brown rice , 1 diced tomato , 1 cup fresh chopped cilantro , 1 small jar verde sauce .
Salsa , guacamole and sour cream as garnish .
To make : this sounds like a lot of ingredients , but it all comes together fast .
Ready ?
Heat the refried beans .
Spread them on the tortillas .
Now sprinkle the cheddar cheese in equal portions .
Add all the vegetables , also in equal amounts .
Perform classic burrito roll ‘n fold .
Place two burritos in an oven - safe dish – choose a small size dish so they ’re snug .
Lightly coat in olive oil .
Cover burritos with the verde sauce , sprinkle with the Monterey Jack cheese .
Bake at 400 for about 10 minutes , or until cheese is bubbling and tortillas are beginning to look a little golden .
Serve hot with salsa , guac and sour cream on the side .
You can use mole sauce or any hot sauce if you do n’t like green .
Note : please do n’t put broccoli or carrots in your burrito .
That ’s just wrong .

4. Magic Pizza
Since we ’re being cheap and easy here , you do n’t have to make a pizza from scratch .
Just buy an organic ready - made cheese pizza .
Ingredients : one cheese pizza , 2 cups extra cheese ( any kinds , but go for something stinky if you ’re brave ) , 2 cups grilled mushrooms , fresh basil .
To make : chop and grill 2 cups wild mushrooms for 3 minutes on medium heat ( anything interesting and savory , like shiitakes or chanterelles ) in olive oil , a few dashes of Worcesteshire , and coarse salt .
Add some dried rosemary and sage for extra savoriness .
Top pizza with the grilled mushrooms and fresh basil .
Sprinkle cheese .
Bake as directed and enjoy !
You should probably avoid garlic on this one .
Note : this is one meal where mock meat wo n’t be a big deal – add in some sliced spicy faux sausage if you like .
5. “ Salad ”
There ’s no need to “ trick ” a guy into eating a salad , despite what sexist articles in lame women ’s magazines may tell you .
Most people enjoy a salad if it ’s loaded with good ingredients and has a decent dressing .
This salad focuses more on the goodies than the greens , so it ’s sure to please everyone .
Ingredients : 1 cup of cubes or crumbles of 2 of your favorite cheeses , 1 cup of candied , salted or raw nuts , 4 cups of your favorite greens , 1 / 4 cup salted pepitas or other seeds , 1 / 2 cup dried cranberries or raisins , 1 / 2 sliced red onion , 1 can well - drained artichoke hearts ( cut hearts in half or quarters to make them bite - sized ) , 1 chopped green apple or pear , and your favorite dressing .
If you want more substance and are n’t feeling lazy , hardboil a few eggs , chill , slice , and add them in to the mix .
To make : you know what to do .
There ’s really no rule ; use whatever you have on hand that you like , from olives to tomatoes to persimmons .
Enjoy !
P.S. A killer dressing : 1/2 cup minced red onion , 1 tablespoon spicy mustard , 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar , a splash of red or white , a dash of salt , 1 tablespoon of honey , and 1/4 cup of oil .
Orgasmic .
6. Overnight Omelet
Overnight as in , he wo n’t be hungry for breakfast if he has this for dinner .
Ingredients : 6 eggs , olive oil , 1 / 2 cup filtered water , 1/ 4 cup chopped bell peppers , 1 seeded and finely minced jalapeno , 1 cup chopped mushrooms , 1 minced white onion , 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese , 1 diced tomato .
To make : it ’s a myth that cream makes lighter eggs .
Water is far better for the fluff .
Prep the eggs for the pan .
Chop up all your veggies .
The trick to a good omelet is a properly heated pan and plenty of grease – but this will be provided by heart - healthy olive oil .
If you ’re lazy , add all the veggies – but not the cheese – into the egg and water mixture and fry up your omelet messy style if you ’re not good at flipping a loaded omelet .
This way you ’ll only have to deal with adding the cheese ; fold as usual once it starts to melt .
Serve sizzling and do n’t forget to give it some Tabasco or salsa love .
Note : this is n’t the actual omelet , but I ’ve included it so you can see that mixing the veggies right in with the eggs is fine .
Loaded Omelet
7. Chow Down Chowder
This is perfect on a cold night when you ’re watching the game .
Serve with a strong , local microbrew .
Ingredients : 1 cup cream cheese , 3 cups vegetable broth , 1 cup cream ( yes , this is a fattening soup ) , 1 tablespoon olive oil , “ Seafood blend ” fresh herb pack or , if not available , chopped fresh thyme , tarragon , basil , marjoram .
2 cloves fresh minced garlic , salt and pepper to taste ( lots of fresh black pepper is best ! ) .
You will also need 12 - 16 baby red or fingerling potatoes ( I prefer to cook these ahead of time ; if you cook them in the stew make sure you boil them for a while first and rinse the starch off before adding everything else , or you ’ll have a very foamy soup … yuck ) .
What else ?
1 whole diced white onion , 1 whole diced large carrot , 1 cup frozen sweet corn , and 1 whole thoroughly washed and sliced leek .
To make : wash and quarter potatoes and boil them in water , NOT your soup ingredients ( cream and stock ) .
Drain and rinse the potatoes – they should still be a little hard , because you do n’t want a mushy final product .
In a small pan , saute the herbs , garlic and onion in olive oil .
In your soup pot , melt the cream cheese into the cream and stock slowly – low heat .
( This soup does take patience but it really is n’t hard to make . )
You can be boiling the potatoes in another pot at the same time .
Once all your separate mixtures are ready to go , and the potatoes are rinsed , combine everything , add the leeks ( they soften fast ) and simmer over medium - low heat for 30 minutes .
Serve with crackers or hot sourdough rolls .
I like a dash of Tabasco and a squeeze of lime , but I ’m a rule breaker .
Make these recipes and he ’ll be licking more than his fingers ! 😉
Note : use organic ingredients whenever possible – it ’s better for you and the earth !
All recipes serve 2 ( and then some – this is n’t Stick to Your 2009 Resolution fare ) .

Chronic and severely stressful situations , like those connected to depression and posttraumatic stress disorder , have been associated with smaller volumes in " stress sensitive " brain regions , such as the cingulate region of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus , a brain region involved in memory formation .
A new study , published by Elsevier in Biological Psychiatry , suggests that chronic insomnia may be another condition associated with reduced cortical volume .
Using a specialized technique called voxel - based morphometry , Ellemarije Altena and Ysbrand van der Werf from the research group of Eus van Someren evaluated the brain volumes of persons with chronic insomnia who were otherwise psychiatrically healthy , and compared them to healthy persons without sleep problems .
They found that insomnia patients had a smaller volume of gray matter in the left orbitofrontal cortex , which was strongly correlated with their subjective severity of insomnia .
" We show , for the first time , that insomnia patients have lower grey matter density in brain regions involved in the evaluation of the pleasantness of stimuli , as well as in regions related to the brain 's ' resting state ' .
The more severe the sleeping problems of insomniacs , the less grey matter density they have in the region involved in pleasantness evaluation , which may also be important for the recognition of optimal comfort to fall asleep , " explained Altena .
She added , " Our group previously showed that insomniacs have difficulties with recognizing optimal comfort .
These findings urge further investigation into the definition of subtypes of insomnia and their causal factors , for which we have now initiated the Netherlands Sleep Registry . "
Dr. John Krystal , Editor of Biological Psychiatry , commented , that " insomnia is a common feature of nearly every psychiatric condition associated with reduced cortical volume ; in fact , it is a common symptom of psychiatric disorders or high levels of life stress , generally .
The study by Altena and colleagues suggests that there are additional risks of not treating insomnia , such as detrimental effects on the microstructure of the brain . "

( CNN ) --
If you 've just had your first heart attack , doctors may one day be able to reverse the damage done with stem cell therapy .
An intravenous method of injecting stem cells into patients who had experienced heart attacks within the previous 10 days suggested that this method works to repair -- not just manage -- heart damage , a recent study found .
The study is a step forward in a field in which a lot of approaches have been tried in animals and preliminary human trials , but none has been approved for widespread clinical use for heart patients .
The new results are a milestone in stem cell research , and for patients , said Jeffrey Karp , a researcher at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , Massachusetts , who runs a stem cell biology lab at Harvard University .
He was not involved in the study .
Most current clinical approaches are focused on managing problems , not addressing the root of the damage , he said .
" Many patients who have a heart attack will go on to suffer heart failure , " he said .
" It 's imperative to try and fix the root of the problem as quickly as possible . "
The research , published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology , were part of a phase I study that set out to show safety .
The trial has moved on to phase II , which is taking place in 50 hospitals in the United States , said Dr. Joshua Hare , director of the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and lead author of the study .
" We 're looking on the time frame here of five years , in the best - case scenario , to have approved cardiac stem cell therapies , " Hare said .
Coronary heart disease , which causes heart attacks and angina -- chest pain resulting from the heart not getting enough blood -- is the leading cause of death in the United States , with nearly 450,000 in 2005 , according to the American Heart Association .
About 1.1 million people have attacks occur in the United States each year , according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute .
The particular kind of cells used in this research are called mesenchymal stem cells , and come from adults , not embryos .
The researchers are using a mesenchymal stem cell therapy that is marketed by Osiris Therapeutics Inc. under the name Prochymal .
The drug , which consists of stem cells from donor bone marrow , gets injected into the vein .
The cells then travel through the bloodstream and take up residence in the heart .
Mesenchymal stem cells have some natural homing capability , and injury serves as a homing beacon for them , Karp said .
The stem cells reduce the amount of scar tissue and increase the pumping strength of the heart in heart attack patients , Hare said .
To a limited extent , they also grow new heart muscle .
The phase I results from 53 patients are not definitive proof that the treatment is effective , but do suggest so , Hare said .
In accordance with clinical trial regulations set by the Food and Drug Administration , phase I is meant to show safety , while phase II and phase III trials are done on a larger group of subjects and evaluate how well the drug works .
In this trial , patients ' doses ranged from 35 million cells to 350 million cells .
There was no change or increase in side effects in treatments getting higher doses of cells , but it seemed that the treatment was more effective -- at least in terms of reducing electrical problems -- in the high dose group , he said .
In separate trials , researchers are looking at how the technique works in patients who have had heart attacks many month or years in the past , Hare said .
The study shows the results of a six - month follow - up with patients in 2007 , and researchers are presently working with data from the two - year follow - up .
More broadly , besides bone marrow transplantations , there have not been any major successes in the stem cell field in terms of helping large numbers of patients , Karp said .
" Mesenchymal stem cells are poised to really be the next major success in cell therapy that could be used to treat tens of thousands of patients , " he said .
There are several advantages to using mesenchymal stem cells for heart therapy .
First , they are adult stem cells , so there are no ethical issues that surround research on embryonic stem cells .
Secondly , at least from a safety perspective , mesenchymal stem cells do not require matching -- any donor can give cells to any other donor , and no immunosuppresant drugs are necessary , he said .
Still , millions of cells are required in order for enough stem cells to reach the heart and have a therapeutic benefit , and it 's costly to get the required numbers of cells for each patient , Karp said .
An area of improvement would be making the stem cell treatment more efficient , he said .
" If we could increase the number of cells that could reach the heart , that would have significant advantages to this approach , " Karp said .
This method of intravenous injection means that the procedure theoretically could be performed in a doctor 's office or clinic , increasing the accesibility to patients , Karp said .
A more invasive stem cell delivery technique has been showing positive results in other clinical trials , involving injecting patients ' own stem cells directly into heart muscle .
The largest national stem cell study for heart disease , sponsored by Baxter Inc. , uses this surgical method , and recently announced success in a 12 - month phase II trial for patients with severe angina .
Researchers found that participants had less pain and an improved ability to walk .
Because stem cells are delivered through a catheter in this method , there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent , Dr. Douglas Losordo , cardiologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago , Illinois , told CNN earlier this year .
The drug , GCSF , which mobilizes stem cells , also carries a small risk of blood clotting .
For the Osiris trials , further research is ongoing determine whether patients would benefit more from more infusions of the stem cells , or if it 's better for the stem cells to come from their own bodies instead of from a donor , Hare said .
While there 's less chance of a person 's body rejecting his or her own stem cells than from a donor , there is a time delay , he said .
Taking bone marrow and amplifying the stem cells in it could take up to five weeks , whereas donor cells could be made readily available , he said .
On the other hand , it is unclear whether a donor could potentially transmit a disease to the recipient in the process .
If you are interested in enrolling in a clinical trial , you can find one at clinicaltrials .gov .
The Orisis trial is still recruiting participants .
While I was busy looking at increases and drops in fastball speeds , I also made note of the frequency with which fastballs were thrown by each pitcher .
As noted previously , changes in fastball speed appeared to have no overwhelming correlation with changes in how often pitchers used their fastball .
Which pitchers did deviate the most from their 2008 ratio then ?
Glad you asked .
Here are the top twenty greatest reductions in fastball usage , according to BIS pitch typing , with a minimum of 50 innings pitched in both 2008 and 2009 .
Brian Bannister , - 42.8 %
Scott Feldman , - 19.1 %
Sean Marshall , - 17.2 %
Pat Misch , - 15.5 %
Nick Masset , - 15.2 %
Dan Wheeler , - 14.8 %
Braden Looper , - 14.3 %
Daniel Cabrera , - 13.1 %
Brandon Lyon , - 12.9 %
Tony Pena , - 12.8 %
Juan Cruz , - 12.8 %
Scott Kazmir , - 11.2 %
Mariano Rivera , - 11.0 %
Ryan Franklin , - 10.5 %
Brad Ziegler , - 10.4 %
Tim Lincecum , - 10.3 %
Cla Meredith , - 10.2 %
Matt Capps , - 9.9 %
Lance Cormier , - 9.8 %
Chad Billingsley , - 9.5 %
Brian Bannister is obviously a special case as he all but abandoned his traditional fastball in favor for a cutter in 2009 .
Scott Feldman too went to more of a cut fastball in 2009 , explaining his drop .
There are legitimate departures on this list however .
Sean Marshall tossed a breaking ball about 14 % more often in 2009 .
Pat Misch fell in love with his slider and changeup .
Scott Kazmir returned to his pre-2008 fastball and slider levels .
The reverse list also has some interesting names on it .
The top twenty greatest increases in fastball usage .
Jamie Moyer , 18.4 %
Miguel Batista , 15.7 %
Joel Pineiro , 12.6 %
Guillermo Mota , 12.3 %
Francisco Cordero , 12.0 %
Nick Blackburn , 11.1 %
Aaron Laffey , 9.4 %
Jesse Carlson , 9.2 %
CC Sabathia , 7.8 %
Clay Buchholz , 7.4 %
John Lannan , 7.1 %
Brad Lidge , 6.9 %
Francisco Rodriguez , 6.8 %
Brian Bass , 6.5 %
Derek Lowe , 6.4 %
Hiroki Kuroda , 6.2 %
Justin Masterson , 6.1 %
Matt Thornton , 5.9 %
Russ Springer , 5.8 %
Jarrod Washburn , 5.8 %
Joel Pineiro developed his sinking fastball to great lengths this season .
Given that his fastball has never been a good pitch , one wonders why Jamie Moyer relied so much more on it in 2009 , to his detriment .
A lot of late inning relief aces appear on this list too , to mixed results .
Francisco Cordero ‘s fastball improved in efficacy a lot in 2009 .
Brad Lidge ‘s went into the toilet and Francisco Rodriguez ’s stayed just about the same , as did Mota’s .
Obviously there is not much of an overarching theme at play here .
Each pitcher has his own particular reasons for appearing in one of these two lists and many of those reasons are unique .
I present the information mostly for the sake of information ’s sake .
Make of it what you will ; I am going to go see if I can tease out any patterns based on disabled list appearances .
The history of old slot machines dates back from early in the 1891 , when the company Sittman and Pitt created the first ever slot machines .
This old game had 5 drums and a total of 50 playing cards , and it could be found in many bars and restaurants .
Similar to slot games now , this game was cheap and cost a nickel to play it , and players could ’ve win a lot of real money on it , just like now .
The method of playing was simple , even on this old machine – players insert their coins , and pull the lever to play .
Payouts were made for lining up poker hands on the reels .
However , unlike newer slots games , these old games usually did n’t had direct payout mechanism , and wins were paid at the bar in the form of non-monetary prizes , like free drinks or cigars .
The development of slots games turned a turn , when the first slot machine with automatic payout was invented – this was the Liberty Bell slot machine .
This one was created somewhere between 1887 and 1895 .
This old game had 5 drums and 3 reels , and only 5 symbols : spades , diamonds , hearts , horseshoes and a liberty bell .
This machine was n’t patented , and it eventually led to many other slot machines being invented .
For many more years , slot machines were purely mechanical .
Players pulled down a lever to play the game , and the manual approach gave out a feeling that players had control in the game – this is why the name “ one armed bandits ” came into existence .
However , the old game Money Honey from the Bally manufacturer was the first electromechanical slot , and it was created in 1964 .
It involved pulling the lever , but it was operated entirely electrically .
This took a turn in the development of slots , as the first video slot was created in 1976 , and this was a huge win for most casinos , and ultimately led to the online casinos slot games , that we know of today .
The modern slot games have in - game bonuses and incredible graphics , sound effects and features that suit the modern day we live in .
Jack Straw privately warned Tony Blair that an invasion of Iraq was legally dubious , questioned what such action would achieve , and challenged US claims about the threat from Saddam Hussein , it was revealed today .
Straw , foreign secretary at the time , gave what now seems prophetic advice in a letter marked " secret and personal " , 10 days before Blair met George Bush at the US president 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , in April 2002 .
That was nearly a year before the invasion .
In his letter , about which he is expected to be questioned when he testifies at the Chilcot inquiry this week , Straw warned Blair , then prime minister : " The rewards from your visit to Crawford will be few … there is at present no majority inside the PLP [ parliamentary Labour party ] for any military action against Iraq . "
Straw warned of two legal " elephant traps " .
He said , " regime change per se is no justification for military action " , and " the weight of legal advice here is that a fresh [ UN ] mandate may well be required " .
Despite the warnings , a previously leaked briefing paper for a meeting of the war cabinet in July 2002 states :
" When the prime minister discussed Iraq with President Bush at Crawford in April he said that the UK would support military action to bring about regime change . "
The Chilcot inquiry has heard that the Crawford meeting was crucial .
It was there that Blair assured Bush that Britain would join a US - led invasion of Iraq and topple Saddam despite legal advice which noted that regime change could not be justified , according to witnesses .
The inquiry has heard that Blair agreed it was preferable first to pursue UN backing for an invasion .
Straw also told Blair before the Crawford meeting that Iraq posed no greater threat to the UK than it had done previously and questioned whether it posed as great a threat as Iran or North Korea .
He added that there was " no credible evidence " linking Iraq al - Qaida and that the " threat from Iraq has not worsened as a result of 11 September " .
Straw continued : " If 11 September had not happened , it is doubtful that the US would now be considering military action against Iraq . "
As foreign secretary , with responsibility for MI6 , Straw would have given his warnings to Blair based on advice from the intelligence agencies .
His letter to Blair , leaked to the Sunday Times , questioned the purpose of an invasion .
He warned Blair : " We have also to answer the big question – what will this action achieve ?
There seems to be a larger hole in this than on anything . "
He added that there was " no certainty that the replacement regime will be better " .
The Chilcot inquiry has heard how ill - prepared the US and British governments were for the aftermath of the invasion and how ministers prevented military commanders from drawing up plans and ordering equipment so as to avoid alerting the public and parliament that military action was likely .
Geoff Hoon , then defence secretary , is likely to be pressed on this when he gives evidence to the Chilcot inquiry on Tuesday .
He is also likely to be asked about the attitude of the Treasury under Gordon Brown , who was then chancellor , towards requests for more money from the Ministry of Defence .
Hoon can expect to be questioned about why he did not explain that the notorious 45 - minute claim in the government 's now discredited Iraqi weapons dossier referred only to battlefield biological and chemical weapons and not to long - range missiles .
Hoon said he did not tell Blair and did not correct misleading reports in the media at the time because he found the task of correcting points made in the press to be time - consuming and frustrating .
Alastair Campbell , Blair 's communications chief who gave evidence to the Chilcot inquiry last week , has written to the inquiry saying he did not want to give the impression that Blair was entitled to say that claims about Saddam 's weapons programme were " beyond doubt " even if intelligence chiefs had disagreed .
Campbell insists
Blair was entitled to make the claim because he believed it was supported by the intelligence .
Senior officials responsible for assessing the intelligence , including Sir John Scarlett , then chairman of the joint intelligence committee , have questioned Blair 's claim in earlier evidence to the inquiry .
The inquiry has revealed that it took evidence from Lt Gen Sir John Reith , chief of joint operations at the time of the invasion , in secret last Friday .
A YouGov poll for the Sunday Times said 52 % of people believed Blair deliberately misled the country over the war .
and 23 % thought he should be tried as a war criminal .
According to the poll , 49 % of people believed Campbell did not tell the truth about the Iraq war at the time and was still not telling the truth , while 31 % thought he told the truth as he saw it at the time .
B2B Buzz Marketing with Paul Dunay

B2B buzz marketing with Paul Dunay .
I finally got my calendar sync ’d up with Paul for this podcast interview .
Paul is an award winning B2B marketing expert .
He is Global Managing Director of Services and Social Marketing for Avaya , a global leader in enterprise communications , and co-author of Facebook Marketing for Dummies ( Wiley 2009 ) .
A B2B Marketing Story
I asked Paul to describe Avaya ’s social media strategy .
His response is this story …
In 2009 budgets were tight across the board .
Many brands experimented with social media .
Actually , Avaya got the social media bug in 2009 .
They started diving into social media with many tactics but they were not well orchestrated under a cohesive strategy .
They had launched social profiles in Facebook , Twitter , a company blog , wikis and even launched internal social communication on Yammer .
Paul was asked by the global CMO to advise and recommend a global social media strategy for Avaya .
Even though Paul already had a full time job in a line of business role , he accepted the challenge of developing the social media strategy for Avaya .
Now , Paul is a very smart guy .
But , he knew he ’d need help .
So , he asked the early adopters of social media at Avaya to meet once a week to develop the strategy .
Mission Driven Social Media
Paul and his colleagues at Avaya defined the mission of all their social marketing to be : Powerful , Authentic , Personal Interaction .
They defined several business objectives including demonstrating thought leadership , building brand awareness , increasing demand , and producing sales leads .
Since Avaya had already started executing many tactics on the social web , they decided to consolidate their strategy across four platforms :
The Avaya corporate blog , a customer forum , a few Twitter profiles and the Avaya Facebook Fan page .
The Avaya blog is the corporate voice .
The forum is self help for customers .
Avaya
Twitter is short bursts of information as well as listening and monitoring what ’s being said about their brand and competitors .
In the Avaya Facebook fan page they cover events , company news , share photos , start discussions and enjoy interaction with their community .
Invite People to Your Facebook Fan Page
One objection I often hear from B2B marketers is they think their customers do n’t have time or interest in Facebook .
Paul asks “ have you invited them to join your Facebook fan page ? ”
He suggests you email people through Facebook to invite them to join your Facebook fan page .
Paul shares my enthusiasm for Facebook because it has every form of media including video , audio , blog , photos , polls and many add - on applications .
All of these functions are available from a Facebook fan page ( for free ) .
Paul suggests that the Facebook fan page is the communication innovation of the century .
In December 2007 during a keynote speech I gave , I predicted that Facebook was going to explode and become the most popular social network .
I was right .
BTW , I ’ve made many predictions in the past that did n’t pan out .
But , this one did .
Integrating Offline and Online
I asked Paul how Avaya integrates offline marketing with online marketing .
He gave me a recent example .
Avaya attended an industry conference where they organized an event around thought leadership .
Customers were invited to attend and express their view of the future of the industry and related communication technologies .
They asked customers for their thoughts about the future of communications technology , and how they see it evolving in the coming years .
Their responses were captured on video and still photos .
Immediately after the event the Avaya team wrote down four key take - aways from that event .
They wrote a white paper about the trends they heard and anointed that paper the premium content from the event .
They uploaded pictures , six videos , wrote four blog posts , and created content for the website , all stemming from this one customer event .
They also did a webinar as a follow up .
In the end , they leveraged a single event into more than one dozen pieces of content .
The content that was created at the event had been multi purposed and shared with people that participated in the event and anyone who otherwise had interest in the content .
Ultimately all the free content was used to drive people to download a premium content asset for a lead conversion .
The 4 Cs of B2B Marketing
Paul does n’t believe the 4 Ps apply to directly B2B .
So , he blogged about the four C’s of B2B marketing : Content creation to attract people .
Connect with people who consume your content .
Communicate on an ongoing basis .
Conversion – nurture the leads with many touches to create conversions .
Some people think that 4
Cs are a deep dive on the “ promotion ” P in the 4 Ps .
I suggest that we ’re all using the contemporary etiquette of the social web to create a conversion .
When our content is good , and we connect with people in authentic ways , we earn the right to create conversions .
Facebook Marketing for Dummies
Paul co-authored Facebook Marketing for Dummies with his college buddy , Richard Krueger .
When Paul was approached by Wiley to write Facebook Marketing for dummies he knew it would be a daunting task on top of his full time job at Avaya , so he asked Richard to help him write the book .
I ’ve read the book and enjoyed it very much .
It ’s filled with many useful tips for businesses who want to use Facebook to connect , engage and market their business using the wildly popular and free Facebook social network .
Their next book is Facebook Advertising for Dummies .
Paul shares my enthusiasm for the ability Facebook gives marketers to conduct highly targeted advertising based on many demographics attributes .
This podcast recording ran close to 30 minutes which is 10 minutes longer than most of my podcasts .
We had so much to cover .
I hope you ’ll listen to the podcast where you ’ll hear parts of the interview not summarized in this blog post .
I invite you to post your comments on your own B2B marketing stories in the comments below .
You can connect with Paul Dunay at his blog or on Facebook or on Twitter .
1. Alexander the Great
You hear a lot about ancient peoples and their feasts / orgies .
It seems it is all true and Alexander was a big fan .
After a full night of feasting , he was on his way to bed when he ran into a friend of his who invited him to another feast !
All in all , Alexander ate and drank for two days straight , barely sleeping , and only stopping because he fell ill .
That ’s right , if possible he would have kept eating .
And he was n’t poisoned .
Poisons at the time were slow - acting ; you needed access to someone ’s food for months in order to have a hope of killing them .
Alexander fell ill suddenly and died after only 10 days .
2. Zachary Taylor
One of the lesser - known American presidents , Taylor is perhaps most important for sharing his name with the original Black Power Ranger .
Seriously though , that is one of the most interesting things about this guy .
Anyway , 16 months after his election the 12th President of the United States was enjoying a 4th of July celebration in the capital where he ate copious amounts of iced milk and cherries .
It was a very hot summer ’s day and the huge amount of fresh dairy and fruit he consumed obviously did not agree with him .
He grew ill later that night and died five days later .
The official cause of death was gastroenteritis .
3. Mozart
Thanks to the movie Amadeus , most people are familiar with the story that Salieri , a composer rival of Mozart ’s , killed him out of jealousy of his talent .
While there is evidence they did n’t like each other much , nothing points to murder .
Instead , the great composer may have been killed by eating too many undercooked pork chops !
Dr. Jan. V. Hirschmann compared a letter Mozart wrote shortly before his death about eating lots of chops and his symptoms to that of trichinosis , a deadly disease caused by worms in undercooked pork .
While this is the latest in the over 150 theories on how he died , the world will never know .
Seven years after his death Mozart ’s grave was dug up for reuse and his bones scattered .
4. Adolf Fredrick
Adolf Frederick was the King of Sweden from 1751 - 1771 .
Twenty years after taking the throne he had an extravagant meal in which he ate numerous servings of lobster , caviar , sauerkraut , slippers , and champagne .
OK , it ’s a lot , but is it much more than what the average American eats at Thanksgiving ?
Well , Adolf Fredrick was just saving room for his favorite dessert , which he had fourteen servings of .
He died of digestive problems later that night and is still know to Swedish schoolchildren as “ the King who ate himself to death ” .
5. Henry I
Henry was King of England from 1100 - 1135 .
While it was possible he killed his brother in a hunting accident to become king , he was not known as an overeater .
However , one night for whatever reason he overdid it and famously ate “ a surfeit of lampreys ” , those weird sucking fish that attach to sharks .
He died in agony .
6. William Makepeace Thackeray
Thackeray , the author of Vanity Fair ( the book , not the magazine ) was a notorious glutton ; he regularly overate .
This regularly caused havoc with his gastrointestinal system .
He could not break his addiction to spicy peppers , further ruining his digestion .
After enjoying one last enormous meal he was found dead in his bed the next morning , felled at the relatively young age of 52 , entirely unexpectedly .
While the official cause of death was a stroke , it was most likely brought on by the stress his gluttony put on his body .
I have made my career in Champ Car .
I have been a supporter of Champ Car and I am looking forward to coming back next year and having the # 1 on the car , driving for Jerry Forsythe and he's one of the principle guys behind taking over this company and hopefully moving it into the next dimension .
I think him and Paul ( Gentilozzi ) and Kevin ( Kalkhoven ) , they have got a lot of big plans for the series .
They plan to keep their star drivers and keep their up - and - coming drivers like we have with Ryan and A.J. ( Allmendinger ) coming up and really make this into something that a lot of people can be proud of .

" Snap out of it ! "
" You have no reason to be depressed . "
" We do n't talk about those things to other people . "
Those were the mantras of my life before I finally chose to visit a psychiatrist on my own as an adult .
It 's still hard for the family to understand and accept , but now I have help .
I take medicine daily to fight depression ; and while I 'm not exactly " perky , " I do n't dwell on my despair daily any more .
But I still have those phrases rolling around in the back of my mind telling me it's my fault that I do n't feel good .
That I could just decide to feel different and I would .
That somehow it 's my own failure to be happy that 's the problem .
I just finished watching the PBS program " This Emotional Life " on Iowa Public Television .
The series is taking a look at our emotions and how they impact our lives .
Each episode deals with several emotions such as fear , anxiety , and depression .
One of the sections of this episode studied depression and brain traits of people who are depressed .
I have bi-polar disorder .
My disease moves my emotions from high to low .
Everyone who is diagnosed with bi-polar experiences the highs and lows in different degrees .
My degree of depression outweighs the highs many times over .
Even when I am " high " I feel depressed .
When I am low and depressed , I 'm almost immobile .
So the studies discussed in this episode are of particular interest to me .
Scientists have been studying the physiology of the brain to see if brains of depressed people show similarities .
The big thing they discovered is that the hippocampus in people who are depressed is smaller than that of people not depressed .
Also , the longer a person is depressed , the small the hippocampus gets .
The hippocampus is located in the prefrontal cortex , the part of the brain that forms memories .
And memories that we create when we are experiencing high levels of emotions -- any emotions -- are more distinct than those we experience during times of neutral emotional states .
When the hippocampus is smaller , it is harder to create new memories and our emotions are lower .
When depressed , I have no desire to create more experiences .
Now the good news !
Anti-depressants allow the hippocampus to re-enlarge .
Measuring the hippocampus in people who were depressed before and after using anti-depressants showed an enlargement of the hippocampus .
The people felt less depressed and the anatomy of their brains matched their moods .
So not only was I relieved to know that my depression is not my fault , but it is a real physical brain disease .
And I can be fixed .
Anti-depressants can make my brain anatomy return to a more normal state .
So : My Brain Needs Drugs !

Every six hours the sun bathes the lands of the earth in as much energy as the world consumes in a year .
If we could just find a way to collect and distribute that energy our energy problems would be solved .
Unfortunately , most of our energy consumption is in the places with the least sunshine ( see insolation map , below . )
Biomass captures and stores the suns energy for later use .
In tropical zones biomass grows year round and can be five times more productive than in the temperate zones .
Biomass can be converted to denser forms and shipped to where it is needed surprisingly economically .
For example , ocean shipping of coal priced at $ 73 / ton from Australia to China only adds about $ 12 / ton to the final cost .
Wood chips are bulkier , but they can be made as dense as coal by heating and compressing them into torrefied pellets .
Ocean shipping is amazingly efficient for long distances .
Australia has shipped an average of two million tons of coal per month to China so far this year .
Ordinary ( untorrefied ) wood pellets have less than half the energy density of coal , yet Plantation Energy just signed two contracts to ship $ 130 million worth of pellets to Europe over the next three years .
With torrefied pellets shipping costs could be halved so the economics would work out even better .
Torrefaction is like coffee roasting .
It requires no external energy but uses about 8 % of the biomass energy to drive the process .
Some of that energy is recovered because pelletizing energy is reduced because the heat - softened lignin in the biomass makes it easier to compress into pellets .
Another big biofuel order recently announced by Valero Energy could be worth up to $ 3.5 billion dollars .
Mission New Energy , an Australian company , will deliver 60 million gallons per year of biodiesel oil from Jatropha crops in Malaysia .
Jatropha is a drought - resistant bush with oily seeds that are easily converted to diesel fuel .
It is not edible and thrives in tropical climates but requires manual labor for picking the seeds .
The all - year growing season , tropical sun and availability of inexpensive labor provides a clean replacement for diesel fuel that can be shipped by the same tankers used for fossil fuel .
Valero ’s annual sales are $ 120 billion , so this is a serious order .
Mission New Energy works with small farmers to encourage them to plant the bushes on unused and marginal land .
They can press their own oil and sell it to the refinery .
Larger farmers can refine the oil themselves , as the refining process is very simple compared to petroleum refining .
Jatropha can also be planted on depleted , marginal forestland to restore the land .
Mission is careful to maintain a balance between food , fuel and forest so the development is a plus for the community .
Unlike factory development , biomass makes it possible for people to remain on their ancestral lands and make money doing clean , outdoor farm work .
With industrialization everybody moves to the city to work on dehumanizing production lines .
Growing biomass can become a major source of income for the poor and undeveloped tropical countries of the world .
Biomass feedstocks can be grown on soils that have no other uses .
For example , Florida has 100,000 acres of phosphate clays that are not stable enough to build on and useless for growing food crops .
Leucaena is a bushy legume that grows nicely on these lands .
It can be harvested three times per year using standard harvesting machinery to chop it into chips and put it into a truck that follows the harvest machinery .
Yields of up to 25 dry tons / acre per year have been obtained but 15 tons is a reasonable average .
Moringa is another legume that has achieved even higher productivity and is tolerant of sulfate acid soils .
Legumes need no nitrogen fertilizer because they can fix nitrogen from the air .
In semi -desert areas , specially adapted plants like Agave can be grown with no irrigation .
Agave stores water in its leaves and heart so that it can continue growing through the long dry seasons that are common in the tropics .
Bamboo has been known to grow as much as 48 inches in a 24 - hour period and has been observed growing 39 inches per hour for brief periods .
The plants can grow to full height in 3 - 4 months but die naturally on a six - year cycle .
Clenergen has been growing a variety called Beema Bamboo in India for four years achieving a yield of over 60 tons / acre after four years of cultivation .
The company has also been raising a tree called Paulownia for several years with a yield of 40 tons / acre .
The company uses a process in which it gasifies the biomass to generate local electrical power but it has announced plans to use gas - to - liquids technology to make liquid fuels out of the syngas .
Liquid fuels can be inexpensively shipped around the world by existing tankers .
In fact , biomass can be converted into a wide range of energy carriers for economic shipping .
Here are some possibilities and their volume energy density in Watt - hours per liter :
Crude oil , biodiesel 8800 watt - hr / liter LNG ( Biomethane ) 7216 ( must be stored at - 268 °F ) Torrefied Wood Pellets 6500 Ethanol 6100 Methanol 4600 Ammonia 3100 Wood Pellets 2777 Liquid Hydrogen 2600 ( must be stored at - 423 °F ) CNG 250 bar biomethane 2500 Wood chips 1388 Hydrogen , 150 bar 405 Lithium Ion Battery 300
The technology for converting biomass to gas and liquid fuels is well known .
Methanol , also known as “ wood alcohol , ” is readily produced from biomass through gasification and catalytic synthesis .
Methanol fuel cells can convert it to electricity for efficient hybrid electric cars .
Methanol has a big advantage because it can be reformed into hydrogen at 200 °C , about half the temperature of other fuels .
This makes fast warm up times practical , greatly reducing battery size .
During World War II methanol was used extensively in Europe to keep cars running in the face of gasoline shortages .
Methanol and other liquid fuels can be made efficiently on a small scale using microchannel technology , originally developed for the space program .
Velosys and Oxford Catalyst have developed a working prototype of a biomass - to - FT - liquids plant that is just being installed in Güssing , Austria .
The 5 ft diameter X 25 ft assembly of 10 microchannel reactors is connected to a biomass gasifier and will output 400 barrels per day of ultraclean synthetic crude oil .
This output can be shipped just like crude oil and burned or converted to a full range of clean , carbon - neutral fuels by conventional oil refineries .
The microchannel reactor is much more efficient than massive - scale gas - to - liquids plants .
The microchannel approach is much like a chemical microprocessor .
This kind of small - scale upgrading technology will soon make it possible for tropical areas to convert their plentiful sunshine into easily shipped liquid and solid fuels .
Another approach to exporting solar power involves using electricity as the carrier .
The Desertec scheme envisions building HVDC electrical transmission links under the Mediterranean Sea to connect the Sahara desert to the European grid .
Massive solar thermal plants in the desert would then supply electricity to all of Europe .
Similar concepts for Australia , India , and the USA have been worked out .
It still remains to be seen if solar thermal with overnight storage can really be economical .
Perhaps someday , but in the meantime , low - tech wood - pellet production is already working at prices almost competitive with coal .
Desertec is like the supercomputer approach while biomass is more like distributed microcomputers .
An informal network of low tech , minimal investment biomass operations spread over the world and using existing transportation infrastructure could make a nice living for millions of small low - tech biomass entrepreneurs .
Like the Internet , no central control is needed , just a free market that rewards innovation and efficiency .
Ocean shipping compares very favorably with HVDC electrical transmission for efficiency .
The energy wasted on a long ocean voyage is a tiny percent of the energy being transported .
Already , in 2008 the worldwide pellet market had reached 10 million tons .
About 25 % of it is already exported to other countries and the market is growing at 25 - 30 % per year .
As equipment for upgrading energy density improves , the economics of this market will also improve dramatically .
Some power plants in Europe are running entirely on wood pellets but the pellet ’s lower density means that extensive modification of the power plant are needed .
Torrefied pellets can be burned without modifying the power plant .
They can be stored , pulverized and burned just like coal .
With shipping costs halved , the economics are compelling .
The southern United States has lots of sunshine and rain so it is an excellent biomass growing area .
The most efficient model for biomass is to grow it locally in a small radius around a Combined Heat and Power ( CHP ) plant built where thermal heat is needed .
Efficiencies of 90 % are often attained because all heat that is normally wasted is used .
A recent study showed that the southeastern U.S. could easily be energy self - sufficient .
The U.S. government has done some detailed studies showing the dramatic environmental superiority of biomass power over fossil fuel plants .
Even conventional farming techniques using fertilizers , insecticides and mechanization turn out to have an excellent energy efficiency factor of 20.5 under a detailed analysis that includes all energy inputs including the energy to make the farm machinery .
With all of the energy inputs subtracted , the plantation analyzed yielded a net energy production of 125 MWh per acre per year .
You may have heard that biomass is much less efficient than photovoltaic cells .
Solar cells are typically rated around 10 % efficiency but this rating ignores the fact that the average energy from the sun is only about 20 % of peak .
The real average efficiency then is .1 X .2 = 2 % .
If we look at land use of some real projects now on the drawing boards we find that the latest photovoltaic , parabolic and tower projects all use about 5 - 6 acres per peak MW .
The Saguaro 1 - MW parabolic trough plant near Phoenix for example , generates 2000 MWh of electricity annually , using 15.8 acres .
That ’s 130 MWh per acre per year .
The 125 MWh figure for the biomass plantation that I mentioned above is for heating value .
Electricity generation can be 80 % efficient if it is done where wasted thermal energy can be used as in CHP plants .
So biomass is at least in the same ballpark as other solar technologies for land use but much cheaper to implement , store and transport than direct electrical generation .
Some terrible mistakes have been made in recent years when tropical rain forests and peat bogs were burned for agricultural development .
Big trees should not be replaced by a succession of little trees .
We must structure carbon trading so that such acts are taxed and only sound actions are rewarded .
Clearing land by open - air burning is common today .
If simple , inexpensive equipment was available for upgrading biomass to shippable products , logging waste could be put to good use replacing coal power .
Biomass can help keep the lights on while we build more renewable capacity .
If we do n’t use it , coal will certainly fill the gap .
Sweden , Norway and Finland have been making heavy use of biomass for power for decades .
They have structured their laws to encourage good stewardship of the land .
We can do the same thing internationally by defining good rules for carbon trading .

US to launch Fallujah - style attack in Afghanistan
6 February 2010
As US and British troops prepare to attack the town of Marjah in Afghanistan ’s Helmand Province , military commanders and the media are openly comparing the operation to the November 2004 siege of Fallujah , one of the bloodiest war crimes of the Iraq war .
The operation in central Helmand province , long an area of intense resistance to the US - led occupation , will constitute the largest military offensive since Washington invaded the country in October 2001 .
At least 15,000 troops are expected to lay siege to the Helmand river valley town , which has 80,000 inhabitants and is said by the US military to be a stronghold of the Taliban .
A total of 125,000 people live in the district around Marjah , which is an agricultural center 350 miles west of Kabul .
The population has been swelled by Afghans fleeing villages occupied by US Marines last summer , following President Barack Obama ’s order shortly after he took office to send 21,000 more troops into Afghanistan .
US Marines , frustrated and enraged over casualties suffered at the hands of an unseen enemy who is able to attack and then blend back into the local population , will be unleashed against the town in a violent military assault , with predictable results .
Brigadier General Larry Nicholson , commander of the US Marines in southern Afghanistan , spelled out the character of the upcoming offensive .
Those found in Marjah would have three options .
“ One is to stay and fight and probably die , ” he said .
“ The second one is to make peace with his government and reintegrate . ”
The third would be to attempt to escape , “ In which case we ’ll probably have some people out there waiting on them as well . ”
“ We 're going to go in big , ” said Nicholson , commander of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade .
“ I ’m not looking for a fair fight , ” he added .
In a highly unusual move , the US command has publicly announced plans for the offensive .
“ It ’s a little unconventional to do it this way , but it gives everybody a chance to think through what they ’re going to do before suddenly in the dark of night they ’re hit with an offensive , ” said General Stanley McChrystal , the senior US commander in Afghanistan .
The stated intention of revealing the target of the upcoming offensive is to allow civilians to flee before the Marines move in .
It also provides a pre-emptive alibi for the US offensive by painting those who fail to heed the warning as die - hard Taliban who deserve to be killed .
Stratfor , a military - intelligence web site with close ties to the US state apparatus , reported Thursday that “ the assault is likely to include the cordoning off of the area , so many of the fighters dedicated to its defense will probably be forced to fight to the death or surrender . ”
The article continued : “ With assaults on Fallujah and Ramadi in Iraq under their belts , the Marines are experienced with this sort of urban assault . ”
What is the record of urban assaults of “ this sort ” ?
The Marine assault on Fallujah in November 2004 reduced most of the city of 300,000 people to rubble , as warplanes dropped thousands of tons of explosives and helicopter gunships and battle tanks fired missiles into buildings and strafed the area with cannon fire .
The US military command claimed to have killed 2,000 “ insurgents , ” but the real death toll remains unknown .
Civilians who remained in the town were subjected to the same bombardment .
Some were shot to death during the door - to - door raids that followed , and others were killed while fleeing .
Wounded fighters were summarily executed , and medical facilities were targeted for military attack .
All those in the city were denied food , water and electricity for more than 10 days .
The operation was a vicious exercise in collective punishment against the population of Fallujah for the killing there of four Blackwater mercenaries and the city ’s protracted resistance to foreign occupation .
It embodied the criminality of the entire war and was characterized by multiple and gross violations of the laws of war .
If American military commanders are to be believed , a similar operation is being prepared in Afghanistan , and for similar reasons .
The town of Marjah is to be turned into a killing field .
As in Fallujah , vengeance plays a role .
US military forces have seen a steady escalation in casualties over the past year , while the CIA suffered a humiliating attack at the end of December that left seven of its operatives dead on the Afghan border .
In Afghanistan , as in Iraq , the US military command sees value in making an example of a population center known as a center of resistance to occupation , sending a message to the entire country that such resistance is futile and will be met with slaughter and destruction .
This bloodletting is officially justified in the name of a never - ending struggle against terrorism .
Behind the propaganda , the driving force of the war in Afghanistan , like the war in Iraq , is the attempt by America ’s ruling elite to counter the crisis of US capitalism through the use of force and the seizure of strategic positions in the Persian Gulf and Central Asia , both centers of vast energy reserves .
A year ago , when Barack Obama entered the White House , there existed hope among broad layers of the American people that his inauguration would turn such words as Fallujah , Abu Ghraib , Guantánamo , Blackwater , torture and rendition into the lexicon of a dark and shameful , but closed , chapter in US history .
The preparation of the Marjah offensive only underscores that , far from being ended , the crimes of the Bush administration are continuing and escalating under the Democratic president .
Today there are more US troops deployed abroad in colonial - style wars and occupations than under Bush , and the killing has spread from Iraq and Afghanistan to Pakistan and Yemen .
The Obama administration is seeking $ 322 billion for the two ongoing wars and occupations , a figure that will doubtless be swelled by further demands for “ supplemental ” funding .
The supposed candidate of “ hope ” and “ change ” has emerged ever more clearly as the hand - picked agent of sections of the political establishment and military - intelligence complex that wanted to effect certain tactical changes in policy , while continuing to employ militarism abroad and wage a relentless assault on the working class at home .
American working people cannot accept a new round of war crimes carried out in their name .
The demand for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all US and other foreign troops from Afghanistan must be joined with a political offensive against the Obama administration and the financial oligarchy that it defends .

Rachel Maddow whacks the McCain campaign for putting clueless Sarah Palin and recent Fox News hire one step away from being President of the United States when they already knew that she was n't qualified .
While I have no desire to push Heilemann and Halperin 's gossip rag of a book , the news that Steve Schmidt and other campaign staffers of McCain 's were n't happy with Palin is nothing new and probably credible .
And anyone with half a brain did n't need inside the beltway campaign gossip to see that their assertions were right and that Sister Sarah had no business being one bad heartbeat away from the Presidency and McCain should have known better than to select her .
As Rachel notes , no one gets to vote for the Vice Presidential candidate and it shows how much that person cares about the country with their selection , and McCain put his campaign before country as much as he might not like being called out for it now .
He got pretty nasty with Matt Lauer for daring to ask him about the book .
I 'd hate to see how would act if anyone actually really got confrontational with him about it .
The battery 's dead : Scientists invent wafer - thin plastic that can store electricity
The battery , which has powered our lives for generations , may soon be consigned to the dustbin of history .
British scientists say they have created a plastic that can store and release electricity , revolutionising the way we use phones , drive cars - and even wear clothes .
It means the cases of mobiles and iPods could soon double up as their power source - leading to gadgets as thin as credit cards .
Researcher Natasha Shirshova with her team 's invention
The technology could also lead to flexible computer screens that can be folded up and carried around like a piece of paper .
And it could even be used to create ' electric clothes ' that charge up as a person moves around and which slowly release heat when the weather gets cold .
Dr Emile Greenhalgh , from Imperial College London 's Department of Aeronautics , said the material is not really a battery , but a supercapacitor - similar to those found in typical electrical circuits .
His team 's prototype - which is around five inches square and wafer - thin - takes five seconds to charge from a normal power supply and can light an LED for 20 minutes .
Dr Greenhalgh , who is working with car company Volvo on a three - year , £ 3 million project to use the material in hybrid petrol - electric cars , said : ' We think the car of the future could be drawing power from its roof or even the door , thanks to our material .
' The applications for this material do n't stop there - you might have a mobile that is as thin as a credit card because it no longer needs a bulky battery , or a laptop that can draw energy from its casing so it can run for longer . '
The material charges and discharges electricity quicker than a conventional battery , and does not use chemical processes - giving it a longer lifespan , he added .
The scientists plan to use it to replace the metal floor of a Volvo car 's boot which holds the spare wheel .
This would mean Volvo could shrink the size of its hybrid battery - and cut down the weight of the car , making it more efficient .
Dr Greenhalgh said : ' No one has created a material like this - within ten years it could replace batteries . '
The new patented material from scientists at Imperial College could do away with the need for traditional batteries forever
Mass Effect made waves in the world of American - style RPGs , but the game had some major flaws that dulled the experience .
On the 360 , the vehicle sections where you drove your land - based transport were often frustrating due to unwieldy controls .
You spent way too much time in elevators as the game loaded the next section .
Dealing with your inventory could be a nightmare .
The PC version of the game addressed many of these issues , but Bioware certainly knew where it could go to make the game better for the much - anticipated sequel .
Our first playing session with Mass Effect 2 lasted four hours .
The next ?
Seven hours .
After finishing the first game literally 24 hours before playing the sequel , the differences between the two releases could not have been clearer .
Many of the RPG elements of the first game have been removed .
The inventory issue has been fixed the simplest way ; now , there is no inventory .
The game is even arranged in discrete missions , complete with screens that describe your performance before you move on to the next session .
You 'll be speaking much more than in most shooters , but you 'll be shooting much more than in most role - playing titles .
This is an action game , through and through .
The graphics are likewise improved , with more details and a steadier frame rate ; and the texture pop -in that was such a problem in the first game has been almost totally removed .
With such an emphasis on increasing the pace of the game , that 's a good thing .
This experience put into the shell of the first title would have been nearly unbearable , and the technical upgrades are obvious and appreciated .
Title Mass Effect 2 Developer Bioware Publisher EA Price $ 59.99 Shop.ars Platform Xbox 360 ( reviewed ) , PC
The decisions made with the game 's design were brave , and serve the story and thrust of this game much more than the stats - heavy presentation of the first title .
Those going into Mass Effect 2 expecting more of the same are going to be in for some violent whiplash , however .
You 'll have to let go of what you wanted out of a Mass Effect game , and begin to deal with what you 've been given .
The good news is that once you move past your expectations , you 're going to realize you 're playing something very special .
Getting your game put together
Inside your case you 'll find a code to unlock the Cerberus Network , the pipeline for DLC and new equipment inside the game .
If you buy the game used or do n't have a code , the network will cost you a stunning 1,200 Microsoft points , or $ 15 .
Still , right off the bat you can get some nice content .
The Blood Dragon Armor and two missions are there for free if you bought the game new .
For reviewers who had the game before launch , only one mission is available for download .
It 's a neat little feature , and when you activate the Cerberus Network a monitor pops up in the main menu and starts feeding you news and information .
When you start a new game , it gives you the option of beginning with a male or female character , or using the Mass Effect 1 import utility .
The utility brings up a logo , scans your hard drive for " Valid Mission Complete Files " and then allows you to load your character .
The utility saw my saved game , chewed on the file for a few moments , and then brought my character over .
Painless and easy .
Once your character has been brought over , the game gives you details about your saved game : your name , rank , specialization , and what decisions you made during some of the turning points of the first game .
Give it a quick read , and then begin the game with your hero all ready to go .
The face that the game begins by talking about your ultimate decisions and actions from the last game is a nice touch .
Those of you playing through the first game again ( or if you 're like me and have just beaten it for the first time ) are in for a treat ; the jump into the second game is seamless .
If you do n't have a saved game , do n't worry , the game will ask you questions about the first title and allow you to tell it what decisions you made .
The bonuses you gain from importing a character wo n't be given to you , however .
A mile wide , but how deep ?
OK , let 's get started .
Talking about the game will be difficult , since everything from the first scene on can be considered a spoiler .
For that reason , we 're going to try to avoid discussing the story at all .
We can say that game gives you a reason to basically re-roll your character in - game if you want .
If you were a soldier , you can now explore biotics .
If you were a social creature , you can now go all out with the combat .
This is all explained in - universe , and it actually makes sense .
There are fewer things for you to worry about when leveling , as well .
You wo n't have to worry about healing , as you now have shields that recharge , and when your shields are gone you see red veins appear along the sides of the screen showing how close to death you are .
Find cover , and you heal .
Yes , Mass Effect went Halo .
You have a few powers to level up , and some of those powers will be locked among your crew until you gain their trust through your in - game actions and conversations .
You will usually level up between missions , since earning experience from within the missions is rare .
You 'll also now be contending with ammunition , although " thermal clips " are smart and will work on everything except heavy weapons .
Heavy weapon ammo must be purchased or found by tracking down power cells .
Using your Unity skill will bring fallen teammates back into the fight , but now that uses a Medi-gel .
You do n't have to worry about the heat of your weapons , just the amount of ammo you 're packing , so you 'll now have to remember to continually grab ammo from the battlefield .
You are able to use shotguns , pistols , assault rifles , submachine guns ... all in equal measure .
Each class is given a selection of weapons , and you can be equally proficient with each one .
You will find better weapons every now and again , and you can choose your loadout by interacting with weapons lockers .
Again , you do n't have an inventory .
Healing is automatic , as in many current action games .
You only carry the weapons you 're using .
Armor , likewise , is n't stat - based , although as you explore the galaxy you can buy and find new sections to your existing armor that will give you certain buffs .
A mask may give you more health , or a holster may allow you to carry slightly more ammunition , for instance .
Google Launches New Open Source Programming Language
Search giant Google launched today a new programming language named GO .
It is an open source development tool geared in combining performance with speed .
Go is based from the C programming family , one of the world ’s widely used programming language family trees incorporated with elements from Python ( a Google - preferred language ) and the Pascal / Modula / Oberon family for faster and more dynamic programs .
Google was motivated to develop a new programming language because it feels that web and computing already change tremendously but the languages have not .
Computers are getting faster but software development is still slow .
People were already tired of the type systems of Java and C++ and are gearing towards dynaically typed languages such as Python and Javascript .
Fundamental concepts such as garbage collection and parallel computations and emergence of multicore computers are still not supported by the popular languages .
To learn more , check out Google ’s hour - long tech talk video below or if you are a developer and just want to get started then take a look at the Go Tutorial and start writing those programs .
Suggests More Crippling IMF loans for third world in the name of saving the planet
Steve Watson ,
Prisonplanet.com
Friday , Dec 11 , 2009
Billionaire George Soros has suggested that poorer nations be persuaded to take on what he describes as “ green loans ” in the name of combating climate change , a policy that would land the already cripplingly poor third world with even more debt , payable to globalist institutions such as the IMF .
Speaking yesterday at the climate summit in Copenhagen , the financier said that $ 100 billion should be provided in loans to poorer nations to help slow global warming .
The proposal would entail third world countries paying back interest to the governments of the richer nations to stem a perceived crisis that they have had little or no direct involvement in manufacturing .
Soros suggested that the loans could be backed with “ special drawing rights ” – a synthetic international paper currency issued by the International Monetary Fund .
SDRs have recently been touted as a new global reserve currency , outside the control of any sovereign body , with the IMF overseeing it in a “ bank of the world ” role .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Money must come from somewhere , not just from a printing machine , ” Artur Runge - Metzger , head of the European Commission delegation , said when asked about Soros ’ proposal .
Of course , it is no surprise that Soros would espouse such a proposal given that he has made billions speculating against currencies on the casino of the financial markets .
Real and tangible assets mean nothing to the man .
Soros added that other proposals for funding , including a suggested $ 10 bn emergency fund for developing nations , are insufficient .
“ The $ 10 bn fund is more than nothing but not much more because of the magnitude of the problem , ” Soros said .
“ It ’s already becoming apparent that there ’s a gap between the developed and developing worlds on this issue that could actually wreck the conference . ” he added .
The IMF and the World Bank are organizations that have made a habit out of looting poorer countries with crippling loans that cannot be paid back , forcing such countries to hand over their entire infrastructure to globalist loan sharks .
Two men who have exposed this monumental scam for what it is are former World Bank chief economists John Perkins and Joseph Stiglitz in their respective works Confessions of an Economic Hit Man and Globalization and Its Discontents .
In what amounts to little more than modern day colonialism , debt forgiveness requires countries to sell their health , education , electric , water and other public services to globalist corporations .
Such “ structural adjustment conditionalities ” have led to massive cuts to health and education budgets in the third world .
Poorer countries have also had to discontinue subsidies and trade restrictions that support local business and development .
The long and short of it is that poorer countries continue to be politically neutralized and socially and economically dismembered by such policies .
Soros ’ latest proposal ties the whole sorry state of affairs up with a large green ribbon .
As we reported earlier this week , the implementation of policies arising out of fraudulent fearmongering and biased studies on global warming is already devastating the third world .
In addition , the leaked Copenhagen text that emerged earlier this week highlighted the fact that developed nations are planning to take on less of a burden than anticipated and that more would be demanded of poorer countries despite the fact that any further cuts in CO2 emissions will further cripple their flimsy economies and poverty - stricken people .
The leaked paper revealed that funds from climate financing , originally allocated to go to the UN and then be doled out piecemeal to third world nations , would instead be paid directly into the coffers of the World Bank and IMF .
The draft agreement would allow people in developed countries to emit twice as much carbon per head than those in poorer countries , who have not caused the rise in emissions said to be threatening our existence on the planet .
The revelations have led third world leaders to accuse the developed world of “ climate colonialism ” .
Another revelation from the summit reveals that under a plan tabled by Britain , money earmarked for education or health in poorer countries would be diverted into projects such as solar panels and wind farms , again diverting much needed aid away from efforts to increase the standard of living .

SINGLE sisters are doing it for themselves .
Refusing to buy into a Bridget Jones - style desperation to settle for Mr Average , savvy single girls would rather live it up on their own .
Statistics show that Australian single women now outnumber their married sisters for the first time in 85 years .
And they even have their new buzzword - being dubbed " freemales " by demographers , who say single women often earn more than their partnered sisters .
Rather than sitting at home bemoaning their single status , these women are blending careers with satisfying social lives and strong friendships rather than spending their weekends manhunting .
A survey of 500 women found 51.4 per cent favoured being single or cohabitation instead of married life .
And those who tied the knot were doing so at an older age - an average of 28 years in 2005 , according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics , which estimates that up to a quarter of women will never have children .
But most are prepared to take on other sorts of commitment , such as buying real estate alone .
Melbourne single woman , Chloe Dennis , 40 , recently bought her first property ; an apartment in Caulfield but had thought she would be sharing a mortgage with a partner .
" You 're brought up in a society with the idea that one day you 'll get married , buy a house with your partner and have children , but it did n't happen that way for me , " said Ms Dennis , an accountant .
" It got to the point where I realised that if I did n't do this ( buy a home ) by myself , it might never happen .
My financial clock was ticking . "
Research shows that 18 per cent of women are investing in property either alone or with someone who is not a romantic partner .
Not long ago I spoke at the memorial service for my friend Herbert Crimes .
An ardent Afrocentrist , he went by the name of Sibanye , which means “ together as one ” in Swahili .
The many colors visible among the large audience at his secular service — held in a rented hall in the Adam Clayton Powell state office building in Harlem where Sibanye used to preside over a monthly humanist community group meeting — testified to the pluralism of his personal life in an America still segregated by race .
Still , the unusual breadth and depth of this man ’s pluralism was enough to make some of the assembled uncomfortable .
While the friends and associates who spoke included Christian , Jew , Muslim , and secularist , Sibanye ’s atheism was politely avoided by most of us .
While I am opposed on principle to appropriating the life of a deceased person for one ’s own ideological cause , I felt called to point out in my remarks that — according to Sibanye ’s own beliefs — he had not gone on to “ a better place ” in the next world .
The person I knew and admired , having had no hope for a life hereafter , devoted most of this life ’s energies to making this world that better place .
Although we sometimes speak of the dead living on through their legacies , this secular promise of immortality only goes so far .
Of course it is true that our lives are worth living in part because we participate in projects — like building a bridge or raising a child — that will outlast our lifespans .
Yet this presupposes that our lifespans are not co-terminal with those projects , or that their survival is not the same thing as our survival .
Woody Allen had it right : “ I do n’t want to achieve immortality through my work .
I want to achieve it through not dying . ”
There ’s the rub .
Believers in the beyond often ask unbelievers how they can accept the prospect that death is the end .
Some even confess they are motivated to believe by their wish to vanquish the grave .
It is true that the atheist has nowhere to go in death but to the “ mankind making / Bird beast and flower / Fathering and all humbling darkness , ” as Dylan Thomas puts it in his astonishing poem to end all eulogies , “ A Refusal to Mourn the Death , By Fire , Of a Child in London . ”
This non-destination makes every death an infinitely greater loss , and makes unmitigated grief the only appropriate response .
In this , only the secular way of death fully honors the dead , where “ better place ” platitudes betray him .
Thomas ’ paradoxically titled “ Refusal to Mourn ” is in fact the refusal to mitigate grief , to paper over the universe ’s forever - loss of singular person in guaze - promises of eternity : “ I shall not murder / The mankind of her going with a grave truth . ”
Yes , dying may be harder for the atheist .
But what I cannot understand , and reject totally , is the further claim that the life stopped short of eternity is thereby robbed of sense or worth :
If it all comes to an end , what ’s it all for ?
The first thing to observe about this existential anxiety is that we ca n’t resolve it just by postulating an eternal afterlife .
Consider the sorts of good things that might possibly await us in paradise : knowing and loving other persons ( including God ) , being known and loved , apprehending truth , experiencing beauty ( and , in the afterlife of some , fine food , drink , and other sensual delights ) .
These goods worth wanting in the next world are goods that we already have in this one — things like love , knowledge , beauty , and pleasure ( even praising an Almighty ! ) .
If a life there is worth having , then a life here is worth having .
Every treasure laid up in heaven has been stolen from Earth , and the joys of paradise are parasitic on the joys of the world .
Yes , having more joy is better than having less , all else being equal .
And that is why death is a loss .
It takes away the possibility of participating in any goods whatever .
But that is not the same as showing them to have never been goods at all .
When our participation in a good is cut short , we may wish it could go on , but the wishing is a sign that it was worth pursuing after all .
The recognition that we missed out on some of its value is evidence that the value did not lose all of its sense .
Heaven can’t help our existential anxiety because the anxiety is not amenable to a quantitative solution .
We ca n’t show that love or wisdom is worth having just by having more of them .
“ What does it all add up to ? ” is not answered by “ n+1 . ”
You can bet your bottom dollar that if there is a heaven , and if there are any thinking persons in it , then at least one of them is at this very instant thinking , “ Okay then , what ’s all this for ? ”
So long as we retain our personhood in the next world , such questions may be inescapable .
And insofar as we do not retain our personhood , we literally have nothing to look forward to .
Sibanye and I spent many hours in conversation about secularism , religion , and the black community .
He was a tireless activist on issues of public education , racial justice , and black male identity , and he believed that Enlightenment values of pluralism , toleration , critical reason , and secular government were essential to progress .
Almost every one of these conversations ended with Sibanye looking forward to some future activities , some next step , and parting with the words , “ We ’ll just take it from there . ”
And so I left the audience at Adam Clayton Powell with those words , for everyone still engaged in the endeavors that animated his life .
Sibanye , we ’ll just take it from there .
Thousands of US troops have now arrived in Haiti A senior Italian official has strongly criticised the Haiti earthquake relief operation , saying it could have been managed much better .
Guido Bertolaso , the head of Italy 's civil protection service , said there was a lack of leadership in the international aid operation .
He also criticised US forces in Haiti , saying troops had no training in running a civilian relief operation .
It is believed the quake on 12 January killed as many as 200,000 people .
An estimated 1.5 million people have been left homeless .
Mr Bertolaso , who arrived in Haiti on Friday , described it as " a terrible situation that could have been managed much better " .
" When there is an emergency , it triggers a vanity parade .
Lots of people go there anxious to show that their country is big and important , showing solidarity , " he said .
He told Italian TV channel RAI he hoped it was " the last time the world acts in this way " .
BBC HAITIAN CREOLE SERVICE Broadcasting on FM radio daily in Haitian Creole at 0910 local time ( 1410 GMT ) , for 20 minutes Giving up - to - date information about where to get basic services and aid Also available on satellite and online , and via social media
BBC Caribbean EU to send police to Haiti Mr Bertolaso , a government minister , said it was logical and " commendable " for the US to lead the relief efforts , but " too many officers " meant they had not been able to find a capable leader .
" We 're missing a leader , a co-ordination capacity that goes beyond military discipline , " he said .
" It 's a truly powerful show of force , but it 's completely out of touch with reality .
" They do n't have close rapport with the territory , they certainly do n't have a rapport with the international organisations and aid groups . "
The US effort in Haiti has also drawn criticism from some Latin American leaders .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez criticised the US for sending too many soldiers but not enough medical supplies .
John Caulfield , a US diplomat in Caracas , Venezuela , dismissed the allegations , saying Washington wanted to provide aid to the Haitian people " and not be distracted by those political criticisms " .
Meanwhile , Haiti's main creditors are due to meet on Monday in the Canadian city of Montreal to map out a plan for its reconstruction .
UK - based charity Oxfam has urged donor countries and institutions to cancel Haiti 's foreign debts , put at about $ 900 m ( £ 557 m ) .
As the relief operation continues , aid workers have criticised Haitian government plans to relocate hundreds of thousands of people from the capital , Port - au - Prince , to large camps outside the city .
HAITI 'S REMARKABLE SURVIVORS Wismond Exantus , 24 - pulled out alive after 11 days Emmannuel Buso , 21 - rescued after 10 days Marie Carida , 84 - saved after 10 days Mendji Bahina Sanon , 11 - trapped for eight days Lozama Hotteline , 25 - pulled out after seven days Elisabeth Joassaint , 15 days - buried for seven days , half her life Ena Zizi , 69 - rescued after seven days
Haiti quake : Survivors ' stories ' An extraordinary operation '
They will be moved while rebuilding work is carried out .
Caroline Gluck , from Oxfam , told the BBC the move could be dangerous for the survivors .
" In the past , experience has told us establishing some huge camps can cause all kinds of security problems , for example , robberies , rapes and kind of gang activities if the camps are kept too big , " she said .
Oxfam was pressing for the camps to be smaller , she added .
Earlier , Haitian communications minister Marie - Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue said authorities were still far from knowing the total number of those killed .
She said the confirmed death toll had risen above 150,000 in the Port - au - Prince area alone .
Haitian - born rapper Wyclef Jean , who set up the charity foundation Yele Haiti , arrived in the capital on Sunday .
He was among a number of high - profile artists to take part in a " Hope for Haiti Now " telethon in the US on Friday which raised more than $ 57 m ( £ 35 m ) for the aid effort .
The search for survivors officially ended on Saturday and the focus has shifted to aid .
But hours after officials declared a formal end to the search , a 24 - year - old man was pulled alive from the remains of a hotel after 11 days under the rubble .
Rescuers described his survival as " a miracle " .

A breakthrough in the research of the Hebrew scriptures has shed new light on the period in which the Bible was written .
Professor Gershon Galil of the Department of Biblical Studies at the University of Haifa has deciphered an inscription on a pottery shard discovered in the Elah valley dating from the 10th century BCE ( the period of King David 's reign ) , and has shown that this is a Hebrew inscription .
The discovery makes this the earliest known Hebrew writing .
The significance of this breakthrough relates to the fact that at least some of the biblical scriptures were composed hundreds of years before the dates presented today in research and that the Kingdom of Israel already existed at that time .
Prof. Gershon Galil of the University of Haifa who deciphered the inscription : " It indicates that the Kingdom of Israel already existed in the 10th century BCE and that at least some of the biblical texts were written hundreds of years before the dates presented in current research . "
A breakthrough in the research of the Hebrew scriptures has shed new light on the period in which the Bible was written .
Prof. Gershon Galil of the Department of Biblical Studies at the University of Haifa has deciphered an inscription dating from the 10th century BCE ( the period of King David 's reign ) , and has shown that this is a Hebrew inscription .
The discovery makes this the earliest known Hebrew writing .
The significance of this breakthrough relates to the fact that at least some of the biblical scriptures were composed hundreds of years before the dates presented today in research and that the Kingdom of Israel already existed at that time .
The inscription itself , which was written in ink on a 15 cm X 16.5 cm trapezoid pottery shard , was discovered a year and a half ago at excavations that were carried out by Prof.
Yosef Garfinkel at Khirbet Qeiyafa near the Elah valley .
The inscription was dated back to the 10th century BCE , which was the period of King David 's reign , but the question of the language used in this inscription remained unanswered , making it impossible to prove whether it was in fact Hebrew or another local language .
Prof .
Galil 's deciphering of the ancient writing testifies to its being Hebrew , based on the use of verbs particular to the Hebrew language , and content specific to Hebrew culture and not adopted by any other cultures in the region .
" This text is a social statement , relating to slaves , widows and orphans .
It uses verbs that were characteristic of Hebrew , such as asah ( " did " ) and avad ( " worked " ) , which were rarely used in other regional languages .
Particular words that appear in the text , such as almanah ( " widow " ) are specific to Hebrew and are written differently in other local languages .
The content itself was also unfamiliar to all the cultures in the region besides the Hebrew society :
The present inscription provides social elements similar to those found in the biblical prophecies and very different from prophecies written by other cultures postulating glorification of the gods and taking care of their physical needs , " Prof.
Galil explains .
He adds that once this deciphering is received , the inscription will become the earliest Hebrew inscription to be found , testifying to Hebrew writing abilities as early as the 10th century BCE .
This stands opposed to the dating of the composition of the Bible in current research , which would not have recognized the possibility that the Bible or parts of it could have been written during this ancient period .
Prof .
Galil also notes that the inscription was discovered in a provincial town in Judea .
He explains that if there were scribes in the periphery , it can be assumed that those inhabiting the central region and Jerusalem were even more proficient writers .
" It can now be maintained that it was highly reasonable that during the 10th century BCE , during the reign of King David , there were scribes in Israel who were able to write literary texts and complex historiographies such as the books of Judges and Samuel . "
He adds that the complexity of the text discovered in Khirbet Qeiyafa , along with the impressive fortifications revealed at the site , refute the claims denying the existence of the Kingdom of Israel at that time .
The contents of the text express social sensitivity to the fragile position of weaker members of society .
The inscription testifies to the presence of strangers within the Israeli society as far back as this ancient period , and calls to provide support for these strangers .
It appeals to care for the widows and orphans and that the king -- who at that time had the responsibility of curbing social inequality -- be involved .
This inscription is similar in its content to biblical scriptures ( Isaiah 1:17 , Psalms 72:3 , Exodus 23:3 , and others ) , but it is clear that it is not copied from any biblical text .
English translaton of the deciphered text :
1 ' you shall not do [ it ] , but worship the [ Lord ] .
2' Judge the sla[ve ] and the wid[ow ] / Judge the orph[ an ]
3 ' [ and ] the stranger .
[ Pl ] ead for the infant / plead for the po[or and ]
4 ' the widow .
Rehabilitate [ the poor ] at the hands of the king .
5 ' Protect the po[or and ] the slave / [ supp ] ort the stranger .
DENVER–
A controversial bill that sought to expand space for religion in Colorado ’s public schools failed to make it out of committee Monday .
Even before the hearing began , the bill ’s sponsor , Christian conservative state Sen .
Dave Schultheis , R- Colorado Springs , seemed to have accepted the fact that his “ Public School Religious Bill of Rights ” would very likely fail to pass and so offered amendments that significantly weakened its provisions .
In the end , so little was left of the bill that the majority Democratic committee members said it simply offered no new provisions on the matter .
In the end , the four Democrats voted against the bill and the three Republicans voted for it .
Schultheis ’s bill , SB 089 , in its original version would have allowed teachers to choose not to teach subjects such as evolution and sex education that might conflict with their religious beliefs .
It also would have allowed them to distribute religious material and display religious symbols in class , among other things .
With passionate opposition witnesses lined up to testify , however , Schultheis amended the bill to merely require that questions concerning religious rights in the schools be presented to the Colorado Attorney General for consideration .
The AG ’s answers to the questions would then be distributed to the schools where they would be publicly displayed .
“ I am not convinced that what we have in front of us today is necessary or in any way improves upon what we have today , ” said Sen .
Pat Steadman , D - Denver .
He agreed with others that laws already safeguard the right to take such questions to the authorities .
But Schultheis made it clear that he meant to address a larger struggle with the bill .
“ The purpose of this bill is to distribute awareness among the public school system of the religious liberties that are guaranteed to all citizens and , yes , even students , faculty and staff of public schools in accordance with the First Amendment of the Constitution , ” Schultheis said at the opening of the hearing .
He said the battle over religious freedom in the United States was being fought in the schools .
“ Public schools have become battle grounds in this fight to preserve religious liberty , fought in large part by threats of law suits by organizations such as the [ American Civil Liberties Union ] .
Many public school officials , rather than offering a challenge to these suits because of the cost to do so , simply acquiesce to the ACLU ’s demands . ”
Most of the testimony heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee reflected the same kind of opposition that greeted a version of the bill backed by Schultheis in 2007 .
That earlier version also died in committee .
State Sen. Evie Hudak , D - Westminster , said her perspective on the bill was shaped by her Jewish faith and by history .
“ I appreciate that [ public ] schools do not teach Christmas , ” she said .
She said the month of December breeds feeling of marginalization for non-Christians .
“ I feel like I am a second - class citizen or like I am not American . ”
“ It sounds like you believe that our school should be teaching the birth of Christ in December and you need to be aware that many children do not celebrate that holiday , ” Hudak said .
Schultheis said that his amended bill would only ask a neutral party to weigh in on controversial questions and that it was a provision that could be exercised by adherents to all religions .
“ I could not disagree with Sen. Schultheis more , ” said Steve Foster , senior rabbi at Denver ’s Temple Emanuel .
“ I ’m glad that the ACLU is on top of this because it guarantees your right to practice your religion as you choose but it does n’t give you the right to practice your religion to try to get me to change mine in order to make you whole . ”
Foster said that the original bill could lend support for what he called the “ tyranny of majoritarianism ” and weaken the U.S. commitment to secular society .
State Sen. Scott Renfroe , R - Greeley , responded to Foster ’s critique by saying that he did n’t believe America was a secular society .
“ You said we were a secular nation and I would disagree with you , sir . ”
Renfroe said he did n’t want to see any religion prohibited .
“ It is true that all religions are under attack in our public schools– except for the religion of global warming . ”
Sen. Keith King , R- Colorado
Springs , asked each speaker how they would feel if the bill was stripped down to only the section that required the AG be asked to develop answers on related religious questions that arise in the schools .
Detractors said school districts can consult the AG at will .
I am looking for straight neutrality in the decision making , Schultheis said .
In the end the committee the bill as simply redundant .
Northern Ireland 's first minister , Peter Robinson , was fighting for his politcal life tonight over claims that he failed to inform the authorities about a £ 50,000 loan his wife passed on to her then 19 - year - old boyfriend .
Robinson said he had agreed to an independent inquiry into his actions by a QC appointed by Stormont after calls from within the power sharing coalition for him to consider his position .
In a statement tonight he said he would fight " smears " against his personal integrity , adding that he had been " tried in the media and the press " .
Castlereagh borough council , which granted Iris Robinson 's lover permission to open a riverside cafe , confirmed yesterday that it was launching an inquiry into her role in enabling Kirk McCambley to open the Lock Keepers Inn on the southern edge of Belfast .
The main allegations against the Robinsons include :
• That Iris Robinson gained £ 50,000 for McCambley from two major property developers , Ken Campbell and Fred Fraser .
• That Iris Robinson lobbied on behalf of Campbell for a building scheme he was involved with in her Strangford constituency .
• That she took £ 5,000 of the money for herself .
• That when Peter Robinson found out about the loan and his wife 's affair he insisted she pay the money back , but did not inform the authorities about her conduct .
• That when her relationship with the young man broke down she demanded the loan back and wanted £ 25,0000 paid into the account of her church , the Light and Life Free Methodist church in east Belfast .
Inside Northern Ireland 's fragile power sharing coalition the nationalist SDLP became the first party to openly question if Peter Robinson could remain in his post .
Mark Durkan , the outgoing SDLP leader , described the first minister 's position as " questionable " after claims on BBC Northern Ireland 's Spotlight programme about the scandal .
Durkan also challenged Iris Robinson to immediately resign from her jobs as Castlereagh borough councillor , assembly member and MP for Strangford .
The Foyle MP said : " Following the broadcast of last night 's BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight programme , it is clear that Iris Robinson should stand down from her public roles forthwith .
" Serious questions must now be asked of Peter Robinson and it will be up to him to prove that the issues raised do not affect his ability or suitability to carry out his public office .
If Peter Robinson is to be brave it is imperative that he calls for proper investigations to take place .
Otherwise it would appear his position as First Minister is questionable . "
The political ceasefire over the personal and financial troubles of Northern Ireland 's " first family " first broke this morning with opponents initially calling for an inquiry into fresh allegations against the Robinsons .
Twenty - four hours after an outpouring of sympathy for Robinson over the revelation that his wife had an affair , he now faces demands to explain allegations that he did not inform the authorities about the £ 50,000 loan to her teenage lover .
The Ulster Unionist party and the centrist Alliance party said he had questions to answer over claims that he had insisted that his wife repay the money but had not informed the authorities about it .
Sir Reg Empey , the UUP leader , has called for a public investigation into his conduct .
" It is perfectly clear there are going to have be a number of investigations by different authorities into this , " Empey said today .
Junior minister and Sinn Féin assembly member Gerry Kelly said Peter Robinson should convene an emergency meeting with Martin McGuinness , his deputy at the head of Northern Ireland 's government , to discuss the latest allegations .
In his statement , Robinson revealed that the office of the first and deputy first minister would appoint an independent senior counsel to investigate if he had done anything wrong in failing to report his wife 's loan .
" I have indicated that I have done nothing wrong , " he said .
Asked if he would take legal action against the BBC programme that levelled the allegations against him and his wife , he said : " I ca n't wait for one or two years to clear my name . "
He said that was why he had agreed to an inquiry by a lawyer appointed by the government .
On allegations that he had not called an ambulance for his wife after her failed suicide attempt on 1 March last year , but had left her to go to the assembly , Robinson said he had acted on medical advice that she should sleep after her failed suicide attempt .
" If I find out on the basis of that [ legal ] advice that I should have [ reported the loan ] then clearly this has consequences , " he said .
" Everything I have done I have done in a proper way .
I am putting this to the test .
I am handing my future to someone to look over these matters in an independent matter . "
The good news is that , despite what 50 Cent may tell you , we generally do n't die if we lose .
The bad news is , evolution has n't exactly helped us adapt to this new lifestyle , and as a result your brain continually tells you to do some things that will keep you poor forever .

Today , the future is about as predictable as it's ever been .
If the government guarantees to pay you $ 200 when you turn 65 , there are laws in place that say they have to do it .
But our brains do n't know that .
So when a guy in a white lab coat walks up and offers to pay us $ 100 in a year , or $ 50 right now , our brains still tell us to go for the rat stew .

This is what 's called hyperbolic discounting , a scientific term that means your brain is about as far from rational as it can get before they 're legally required to keep you in a zoo enclosure .
We 're only half kidding .
Hyperbolic discounting puts us on the level of pigeons and rats in the realms of fiscal responsibility .
It 's not just a lab experiment .
There are entire industries that rely on your inability to think rationally about the future .
Our whole economic crisis was kicked off by borrowers taking on loans they could n't afford , after lenders offered them lower payments ( or no payments at all ) for the first year .

With an official response from the government of Singapore
FOND of having the last word , Singapore 's government can nevertheless be flexible .
Who would have thought it would be building casinos ?
But one policy that shows no sign of reversing is Singapore 's antipathy towards public welfare .
The state 's attitude can be simply put : being poor here is your own fault .
Citizens are obliged to save for the future , rely on their families and not expect any handouts from the government unless they hit rock bottom .
The emphasis on family extends into old age : retired parents can sue children who fail to support them .
In government circles “ welfare ” remains a dirty word , cousin to sloth and waste .
Singapore may be a nanny state , but it is by no means an indulgent nanny .
The aftershock of a deep recession , which pushed unemployment among citizens up to 4.1 % in September — high for Singapore — has not altered the popular belief that the dole is bad for society .
The casinos , which open on February 14th , have already helped reduce unemployment , which by December had fallen back to 3 % , seasonally adjusted .
The government does run a handful of schemes directed at some of the needy , from low - income students to the unassisted elderly .
But these benefits are rigorously means - tested and granted only sparingly .
The most destitute citizens ' families may apply for public assistance ; only 3,000 currently qualify .
Laid - off workers receive no automatic benefits .
Instead they are sorted into “ workfare ” and training schemes .

Could really use a hand
Applicants complain that the process of seeking help is made tiresome and humiliating .
Indeed that could be the point , supposing it deters free - riders .
Officials take a dim view of European - style welfare systems , which are said to beget laziness .
The Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports ( MCYS ) , which administers the various schemes , says theirs are designed as a “ springboard ” to self - reliance .
Getting people back to work takes priority over relieving any temporary drop in income .
In a fiscal stimulus unveiled a year ago in response to the financial crisis , S$ 5.1 billion ( $ 3.6 billion ) was allocated for employment measures , including grants to companies to retain staff .
Those who remain out of work can join a government training scheme ; by December , 169,000 unemployed workers had done so .
Many Singaporeans are wedded to their jobs and look askance at idleness of any kind .
The government is leery of generous handouts , fearing they might undercut the work ethic while burdening taxpayers .
But the thinness of the safety net also reflects a widespread article of faith , recited and reinforced over the years .
Even among the social workers who work in hard - hit communities there is surprisingly little frustration at the meagreness of the handouts on offer or at the lengthy application process .
One explains that Singapore needs to weed out undeserving claimants and shakes his head at the potential cost of a comprehensive welfare service .
Yet in his next breath he mentions a number of local families who have been forced to sleep rough since mortgage lenders foreclosed on their flats .
Nobody doubts that wealthy Singapore could be more generous .
In 2008 the World Bank rated it the third richest country in the world , in terms of GDP per head at purchasing - power parity .
And the idea that its Big - Brotherly government might be outfoxed by conniving welfare queens seems odd .
When a visiting news crew filmed an elderly woman scavenging in Chinatown and bemoaning her homelessness , the government promptly identified her as a miserly flat - owner who did not need to beg .
Indeed , acute poverty is hard to spot in Singapore .
Public housing is in good shape ; no slums are allowed to fester .
Soup kitchens do exist , but foreign labourers are often first in line .
But Singapore still faces the challenge of rising inequality in a society that is also rapidly ageing .
By 2030 , says MCYS , one in five Singaporeans will be over 65 ( UBS , whose largest shareholder is Singapore 's sovereign - wealth fund , has estimated the date at 2020 ) .
Incomes have stagnated or even fallen at the bottom of the spectrum , as the rich pull further ahead of the middle classes .
Long - term unemployment among middle - aged professionals , who do not qualify for workfare , is on the rise , says Leong Sze Hian , a financial expert and blogger .
Native resentment is also growing against the influx of migrant workers : 35 % of the workforce of 3 m is now foreign .
It is often cheaper for companies to import semi-skilled and unskilled workers — there were 680,000 at last count — than to hire locals , who require pension contributions .
Official reassurances that migrants create growth do not convince those competing for scarce jobs .
Lee Kuan Yew , Singapore 's founding father and still its " minister mentor " has maintained that ambitious migrants help to keep citizens on their toes .
In an interview given to National Geographic last July he said that if native Singaporeans lag behind “ hungry ” foreigners because “ the spurs are not stuck on [ their ] hinds ” , that is not the state 's problem to solve .
This nascent backlash may eventually soften the anti-welfare tone set by Mr Lee .
The Economic Society of Singapore ( ESS ) — not exactly a radical cell — recently proposed to a government committee that it should build a more robust safety net , starting with unemployment insurance .
This would promote social stability and help muster public support for Singapore 's open - door migration policies , it argues .
Properly designed , such measures would not create disincentives to work and thrift .
“ While self - reliance is a good principle in general , it may be neither efficient nor just if taken to extremes , ” noted the ESS .
As the US population becomes increasingly obese while smoking rates continue to decline , obesity has become an equal , if not greater , contributor to the burden of disease and shortening of healthy life in comparison to smoking .
In an article published in the February 2010 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine , researchers from Columbia University and The City College of New York calculate that the Quality - Adjusted Life Years ( QALYs ) lost due to obesity is now equal to , if not greater than , those lost due to smoking -- both modifiable risk factors .
QALYs use preference - based measurements of Health - Related Quality of Life ( HRQOL ) which allow a person to state a relative preference for a given health outcome .
Since one person may value a particular outcome differently than another person , these measures capture how each respondent views his or her own quality of life .
The 1993 -2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS ) , the largest ongoing state - based health survey of US adults , has conducted interviews of more than 3,500,000 individuals ; annual interviews started with 102,263 in 1993 and culminated with 406,749 in 2008 .
This survey includes a set of questions that measures HRQOL , asking about recent poor health days and tracking overall physical and mental health of the population .
The authors analyzed these data and converted the measures to QALYs lost due to smoking and obesity .
From 1993 to 2008 , when the proportion of smokers among US adults declined 18.5 % , smoking - related QALYs lost were relatively stable at 0.0438 QALYs lost per population .
During the same period , the proportion of obese people increased 85 % and this resulted in 0.0464 QALYs lost .
Smoking had a bigger impact on deaths while obesity had a bigger impact on illness .
Investigators Haomiao Jia , PhD and Erica I. Lubetkin , MD , MPH , state , " Although life expectancy and QALE have increased over time , the increase in the contribution of mortality to QALYs lost from obesity may result in a decline in future life expectancy .
Such data are essential in setting targets for reducing modifiable health risks and eliminating health disparities . "
The article is " Trends in Quality - Adjusted Life - Years Lost Contributed by Smoking and Obesity " by Haomiao Jia , PhD , and Erica I. Lubetkin , MD , MPH .

Many have noted that for all its dumbassery , Twitter is very useful for one thing : determining someone ’s intelligence .
The thinking behind this is that Twitter forces users to express thoughts in 140 characters or less .
Some do it exceptionally well , others do not , and some expose themselves to be intellectual lightweights time and time again .
Sarah Palin is one of those people .
For instance , here are two tweets she made on Saturday …
What the hell did she just say ?
Those tweets look as though they were written in freakin’ hieroglyphics !
You almost need a translator to read them .
The woman is completely incapable of communicating a coherent thought in this format .
AND A LARGE SWATH OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WANT HER TO BE PRESIDENT !
God help us .
Our energy - hungry brains operate reliably and efficiently while processing a flood of sensory information , thanks to a sort of neuronal thermostat that regulates activity in the visual cortex , Yale researchers have found .
The actions of inhibitory neurons allow the brain to save energy by suppressing non-essential visual stimuli and processing only key information , according to research published in the January 13 issue of the journal Neuron .
" It 's called the iceberg phenomenon , where only the tip is sharply defined yet we are aware that there is a much larger portion underwater that we can not see , " said David McCormick , the Dorys McConnell Duberg Professor of Neurobiology at Yale School of Medicine , researcher of the Kavli Institute of Neuroscience and co-senior author of the study .
" These inhibitory neurons set the water level and control how much of the iceberg we see .
We do n't need to see the entire iceberg to know that it is there . "
The brain uses the highest percentage of the body 's energy , so scientists have long wondered how it can operate both efficiently and reliably when processing a deluge of sensory information .
Most studies of vision have concentrated on activity of excitatory neurons that fire when presented with simple stimuli , such as bright or dark bars .
The Yale team wanted to measure what happens outside of the classical field of vision when the brain has to deal with more complex scenes in real life .
By studying brains of animals watching movies of natural scenes , the Yale team found that inhibitory cells in the visual cortex control how the excitatory cells interact with each other .
" We found that these inhibitory cells take a lead role in making the visual cortex operate in a sparse and reliable manner , " McCormick said .
James Mazer was co-senior author of the paper with McCormick .
Bilal Haider , a Yale graduate student , was lead author .
Other Yale authors of the paper were Matthew R. Krause , Alvaro Duque , Yuguo Yu and Jonathan Touryan .
The work was funded by the National Eye Institute and the Kavli Foundation .
' Nobel Peace Prize - winner Barack Obama ups spending on nuclear weapons to even more than George Bush '
President Obama is planning to increase spending on America 's nuclear weapons stockpile just days after pledging to try to rid the world of them .
In his budget to be announced on Monday , Mr Obama has allocated £ 4.3 billion to maintain the U.S. arsenal - £ 370 million more than George Bush spent on nuclear weapons in his final year .
The Obama administration also plans to spend a further £ 3.1 billion over the next five years on nuclear security .
Investment : President Barack Obama is to raise the budget to spend on maintaining U.S. nuclear weapons by £ 370 million - more than George Bush
The announcement comes despite the American President declaring nuclear weapons were the ‘ greatest danger ’ to U.S. people during in his State of the Union address on Wednesday .
And it flies in the face of Obama ’s Nobel Peace Prize , awarded to him in October for ‘ his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples ’ .
The Nobel committee was attacked at the time for bestowing the accolade on a new president whose initiatives are yet to bear fruit – which included reducing the world stock of nuclear arms .
Barack Obama 's State of the Union speech : Even as we prosecute two wars , we are also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people - the threat of nuclear weapons .
I have embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons , and seeks a world without them .
To reduce our stockpiles and launchers , while ensuring our deterrent , the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest - reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades .
And at April 's Nuclear Security Summit , we will bring forty - four nations together behind a clear goal : securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years , so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists .
These diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of these weapons .
That is why North Korea now faces increased isolation , and stronger sanctions sanctions that are being vigorously enforced .
That is why the international community is more united , and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated .
And as Iran 's leaders continue to ignore their obligations , there should be no doubt : they , too , will face growing consequences .
That is the leadership that we are providing -- engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people .
The budget is higher than that allocated by George Bush – who was seen by many as a warmongering president in the wake of the Iraq invasion in 2003 – during his premiership .
During his 70 - minute State of the UNion speech on Wednesday , which marked his first year in office , Obama said : ' I have embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons , and seeks a world without them . '
However , Vice President Joe Biden today supported the increase on nuclear weapons maintenance , saying : ‘ Even in a time of tough budget decisions , these are investments we must make for our security .
‘ We are committed to working with Congress to ensure these budget increases are approved . ’
Biden said the Obama administration had inherited a ‘ steady decline ’ in support for U.S. nuclear stockpiles and infrastructure .
‘ For almost a decade , our laboratories and facilities have been underfunded and undervalued , ’ he said .
‘ The consequences of this neglect - like the growing shortage of skilled nuclear scientists and engineers and the ageing of critical facilities - have largely escaped public notice .
‘ The budget we will submit to Congress on Monday both reverses this decline and enables us to implement the president 's nuclear - security agenda . ’
He added : ' This investment is long overdue .
It will strengthen our ability to recruit , train and retain the skilled people we need to maintain our nuclear capabilities .
' It will support the work of our nuclear labs , a national treasure that we must and will sustain . '
The Obama administration will publish its budget for fiscal year 2011 on Monday .
The proposal will include a budget increase for nuclear issues while paring back other areas in an effort to control record deficits .
Biden said those steps along with others to advance non-proliferation were essential to ‘ holding nations like North Korea and Iran accountable when they break the rules , and deterring others from trying to do so ’ .
“ Valhalla ” at work : FBI undercover asset Hal Turner , who was tasked to infiltrate and radicalize the “ far right , ” speaks at a rally sponsored by the FBI - controlled National Socialist Movement
We ’ll be fighting in the streets with our children at our feet and the morals that they worship will be gone .
And the men who spurred us on sit in judgment of all wrong they decide , and the shotgun sings the song .
~ Pete Townsend
It ’s difficult not to experience a faint pang of sympathy for Hal Turner , albeit an ephemeral one deeply buried beneath multiple layers of well - earned disgust .
For at least five years , and probably more , Turner was a paid informant and provocateur in the employ of the world ’s largest sponsor of terrorism , the Federal Government .
His assignment was to bait easily influenced people with incendiary rhetoric about race and other resentments , and reel in anyone who bit a little too lustily on the bait .
The Bureau credits Turner with personally bringing more than 100 “ extremists ” to their attention , many of whom ( the Bureau wo n’t specify how many ) were arrested .
There ’s every likelihood that at least some of Turner ’s victims were offered the same deal offered to Randy Weaver after he was set up on trivial and spurious firearms charges by an undercover snitch for the ATF : Become an informant / provocateur , and you ’ll stay out of jail .
Weaver rejected the deal , and the FBI eventually retaliated by attacking his home and murdering his wife and son .
Jos Padilla , a rougher customer than Weaver , rejected the same deal ; he was declared an “ enemy combatant , ” subjected to prolonged torture intended to destroy his mental equilibrium and break his will , and eventually convicted on exceptionally dubious terrorism - related charges .
Before he was outed as a stukach in early 2007 , Turner was the host of a web - based talk radio program and a freelance speaker who specialized in “ incitement - and - indictment ” entrapment of “ right - wing extremists . ”
Hackers discovered a cache of e-mail correspondence between Turner and William Haug , an agent working for a Joint Terrorism Task Force who acted as the informant ’s handler .
Turner closed down his radio program while emitting great gusts of affected outrage over what he insisted were spurious accusations that he had collaborated with the Feds .
One Nation , Under Surv ... Kenneth W. Royce Best Price : $ 3.80 Buy New null ( as of 06:20 EST - Details )
In a message posted to Pro Libertate after he was identified as an agent provocateur — along with federal assets tasked to carry out similar missions within Muslim sub-populations in the U.S. —
Turner insisted that only “ PARANOID FREAKS ( like this blog ) ” would suspect him of collaboration .
By way of establishing his neo -Nazi bona fides , Turner boasted that “ my [ white supremacist ] rallies in Kingston NY and Kalamazoo , MI cost those cities $ 60,000 and $ 120,000 respectively in police overtime and that there ’s no way the FBI would have approved anything like that by an informant because the cities would have demanded the money back ! ”
Actually , as we ’ll see anon , the FBI has no problem staging white supremacist rallies and protest marches that help “ local ” police departments rack up overtime .
Certainly , the police do n’t mind making a little extra money by swanning about in riot gear .
Events of the sort Turner organized are an intelligence bonanza for the Regime :
They give the FBI ( and , most likely , other Homeland Security assets ) an opportunity to harvest detailed information for federal databases about both “ right - wing extremists ” and their opposition .
We know this is the case through first - person testimony from an FBI undercover asset who spent nearly a decade worming his way through the “ radical right ” — including the National Socialist Movement ( NSM ) .
The NSM ’s adherents doubtless see themselves as the finely honed blade of a resurgent “ white power ” movement , a description promoted with similar zeal by professional hate - hucksters like Morris Dees ’ artfully misnamed Southern Poverty Law Center and the so - called Anti-Defamation League .
Actually , the NSM is “ all show , no go ” — it ’s more of a federally controlled traveling roadshow , sort of a Third Reich tribute band .
Its cadres exude all of the raw menace of the hapless Illinois Nazis from The Blues Brothers , and possess all of the street - fighting chops of the bumbling Black Widow biker gang from Clinton Eastwood ’s Philo Beddoe films .
But I digress .
We were discussing Hal Turner ’s career as an FBI informant / provocateur code - named “ Valhalla , ” details about which have been pried from the Bureau by reporters for the Bergen ( New Jersey ) Record .
Beginning in 2003 ( or , as Turner claims , 2002 ) , Turner was a paid informant “ who spied on his own controversial followers , ” reports the Record , citing “ government documents , e-mails , court records , and almost 20 hours of jailhouse interviews ” with the snitch .
Turner “ received thousands of dollars from the FBI to report on such groups as the Aryan Nations and the white supremacist National Alliance , and even a member of the Blue Eyed Devils skinhead punk band . ”
“ I was not some street snitch , ” insists Turner .
“ I was a deep undercover intelligence operative . ”
He demands recognition of that distinction with the same desperate desire for dignity displayed by any other whore who seeks to upgrade his or her job description with a more refined title .
The FBI budgeted at least $ 100,000 to pay for Turner ’s performances , both on his radio program and in public speeches .
He now insists that he was merely role - playing on behalf of his pimps — both the FBI ’s Special Agent Haug and New Jersey State Police Detective Leonard Nerbetski , who also served on the Newark Joint Terrorism Task Force .
As he tells the story , Turner was required to feign passion for various unsavory causes :
In interviews with the Record , Turner maintained that “ the FBI coached him to make racist , anti-Semitic and other threatening statements and he now feels double - crossed by the Bureau after his arrest . ”
“ The audience loves the rip- roaring radio psycho , ” Turner boasted in an e-mail to the FBI .
“ They literally throw money at it .
Just be confident that the personality you hear ( or hear about ) on radio is not real life .
I have zero intention of doing anything stupid . ”
In the guise of the “ radio psycho , ” Turner — with the FBI ’s help — was pulling down about $ 15,000 a month to express such edifying sentiments as the following : “ A full day of violence against blacks would be a really nice thing … .
[ L ] ynchings , church burnings , drive - by shootings and bombings [ would ] put these subhuman animals back in their place . ”
Turner materialized at various white power gatherings in several states .
He also traveled to Brazil on the FBI ’s dime to spy on suspected white supremacists in that country , as well as to investigate an alleged plot by white supremacists and Brazilian Arabs to send “ consumer goods ” to resistance fighters in Iraq .
It ’s difficult to believe that the CIA remained entirely aloof from that aspect of Turner ’s career .
While the FBI was willing to abet Turner ’s efforts to incite violence against innocent people , the Feds moved against him shortly after he published comments on his blog interpreted as death threats against three judges in Chicago .
He was arrested shortly before the 2008 election and is scheduled to stand trial this week .
As the song says , “ some men like the fishin ’ , some men like the fowlin’ , and some men like to hear the cannonball a - roarin . ”
Turner likes nothing more than hearing the sound of his own voice .
Yet “ here I am in prison , betrayed , ” he laments , arrested by the same FBI Special Agent who recruited him and — he plaintively maintains — fed him his lines .
“ I was given specific instructions , ” Turner declares , and he played the role of racist agitator out of his duty as “ a loyal , patriotic decent American citizen . ”
Undercover Nazi David Gletty Best Price : $ 4.40 Buy New null ( as of 10:35 EST - Details )
Turner may be telling the truth .
His experiences are eerily similar to those recounted by former FBI “ deep cover ” operative ( and one - time Roller Derby star — no , I ’m not kidding ) David Gletty in his ineptly written but highly useful memoir Undercover Nazi : The FBI Infiltration of Extremist Groups in America .
In what strikes me as a transparent effort to cultivate a marketable mystique , Gletty says that many details of his work as a paid FBI snitch remain “ classified . ”
He claims to have been recruited in 2000 when , as the leader of a constitutional militia , he came across a plot by an Appalachian white supremacist to set off a string of radiological bombs in collaboration with al - Qaeda .
Recruited as a “ deep cover ” operative , Gletty spent several years cultivating ties with “ extremist ” groups , including elements of the KKK , the Hammerskins , and eventually the National Socialist Movement .
He was careful to get his “ ticket punched ” by working with legitimate dissident groups such as the League of the South , and various immigration reform groups , such as at least one element of the Minuteman volunteer border watch movement .
Gletty ’s most notable achievement was to infiltrate and become leader of a National Socialist Movement chapter in Florida and organize a 2006 NSM march in Orlando that was intended to sow fear and anger in a predominantly black neighborhood .
To prepare for that role , Gletty behaved much as Hal Turner had , fulminating in public about the supposed inferiority of non-white people and befouling the air with exhortations to collectivist violence .
This not only legitimized Gletty in the eyes of his comrades in the NSM , it also helped to rile up the group ’s enemies , thereby ensuring a large turnout of counter - protesters for the February 2006 march in Orlando — which was exactly what the Bureau desired .
During his years as an informant / provocateur , Gletty was usually accompanied by a fellow asset he identifies only as “ Joe . ”
During the Orlando protest , Gletty recalls , Joe carried a concealed digital camera “ for taking all the photos he could of protesters and counter - protesters .
Then the images would be fed into the FBI face recognition computer .
At least 1000 faces for the computer to digest . ”
In addition to producing a bounty of biometric intelligence for the FBI , the Orlando rally offered a good dry run for a future Homeland Security crack - down .
Gletty points out that his FBI handler was “ actually pumped up ” about the Orlando march , “ because the protest would be a great training exercise for the Orlando Police Department , Orange County Sheriff ’s Department , the FBI , and MBI [ the Central Florida Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation ] as they would all be in attendance . ”
As a leader in the white supremacist underground , Gletty held many “ surveillance parties ” — not only public events , but private functions used to gather intelligence and , where possible , set up various low - level thugs to become informant / provocateurs themselves .
For three years , “ Joe and I … traveled from state to state , rally to rally , and party to party , infiltrating the White Power Movement in America , ” Gletty recalls .
“ Thousands of miles , hundreds of photographed faces , and a myriad of tape recordings were contributing to the eradication of racial and religious prejudice in America . ”
Really ?
To judge from recent attention earned by the NSM , Gletty ’s mission was not to help “ eradicate ” prejudice ( as if this could be accomplished through government intervention ) , but rather to bring the group more completely under the FBI ’s control .
The NSM is a remnant of George Lincoln Rockwell ’s American Nazi Party ( ANP ) .
According to Hate : George Lincoln Rockwell and the American Nazi Party , the ANP was thoroughly compromised through the FBI ’s notorious COINTELPRO operation ; by the time of his murder in 1967 , Rockwell was widely believed to be a “ patsy ” for the FBI or some other intelligence agency .
One objective of the anti-ANP COINTELPRO operation was to create a rift between Rockwell ’s Nazi outfit and the United Klans of America .
By the late 1970s , the Klan was thoroughly honeycombed with FBI assets .
In fact the Bureau boasted that it had enough Klansmen on its payroll in North Carolina to elect that state ’s Grand Dragon :
At one point , 7 of the 8 members of a Charlotte Klan chapter reportedly were FBI assets informing on the klavern ’s sole non-federal employee .
A sitcom - worthy simulacrum of street - fighting : NSM members square off against the equally ludicrous “ Brown Berets de Aztlan ” in Riverside , California .
Edward Dawson , an informant / provocateur on the payroll of the Greensboro police department and under the supervision of the FBI , helped orchestrate a November 3 , 1979 street clash between white supremacists and Communists that left five people dead .
The “ White Power ” contingent included elements of both the Klan and the American Nazi Party , whose FBI - engineered rift had apparently healed sufficiently to permit joint action .
The National Socialist Movement ’s current strategy is to provoke tumult and violence , rather than participating in it directly .
In recent weeks the group has achieved a relatively high profile by staging anti-immigration rallies in Riverside , California and Phoenix , Arizona .
In California , a small knot of NSM denizens faced off with members of “ Los Brown Berets de Aztlan , ” a foundation - funded militant Chicano group , with riot police clad in body armor on hand to maintain “ order . ”
A few weeks later the group inflicted itself on an immigration - reform protest in Arizona during which the group ’s most visible spokesperson , J.T. Ready , unfurled a portrait of Adolf Hitler .

Ready — a dishonorably discharged ex-Marine — is a pretty good candidate to be the next NSM figure outed as an asset of the Feds .
An ambulatory wad of cholesterol and bile , Ready looks like the unfortunate result of a genetic experiment combining the most unpleasant traits of Ernst Roehm and Chris Farley .
While certainly not telegenic , Ready has achieved a certain media prominence as a result of his candor in reciting the Nazi party line .
The sudden prominence of the NSM has been noted — with a detectable hint of gratitude — by left - collectivists eager to shoehorn resistance to the Obama Regime into a pre-determined narrative : Critics of the Blessed One and his administration are animated by concealed bigotry , according to this reading , whether they know it or not , and their rhetoric is creating an “ atmosphere ” of incipient violence that will engender domestic terrorism .
It should be remembered that the same tropes were put into play early in the last Democratic administration , just before the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing — a terrorist act for which disenchanted former federal employee Timothy McVeigh was executed , but was actually carried out with the help of “ others unknown , ” including several federal assets connected to a bizarre little white supremacist commune known as Elohim City .
The Regime has gone to a great deal of trouble to keep the otherwise moribund White Power movement on life support .
It ’s simply too useful as a political foil — and , occasionally , as an instrument of politically useful violence — for the Regime to let it die .

Figures released by the Home Office show that more than 1,600 council employees and other civilians , including dog wardens , park keepers and security guards , now have the power to police communities .
In the last 12 months , under the tenure of home secretaries of Jacqui Smith and Alan Johnson , there has been a 20 per cent increase in the number of people who have been given the responsibilities .
And the rapid growth in the army of civilians able to impose fines , confiscate property and demand names and addresses has been matched by an increasing use of private security companies to help police in their investigations .
Last night human rights groups attacked the " privatisation of policing " as a worrying erosion of civil liberties , and one senior police officer said he was unhappy about the role of private security companies in the policing of public demonstrations .

Peter Fahy , chief constable of Greater Manchester Police and the head of workforce development for the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) , said that he " did not believe there is a role for the private sector in the policing of public spaces " .
His comment follows reports that G4S , a private security company , has provided mobile custody cells and detention officers at two recent environmental demonstrations .
Shami Chakrabarti , the director of Liberty , said : " Sir Robert Peel would be spinning in his grave at the idea of replacing traditional , consent - based policing with Blackwater - style private security .
The British public trusts police constables to keep the peace and uphold the rule of law .
They do n't expect such a sacred trust to be sub-contracted to the lowest bidder . "
Sally Ireland , director of criminal justice policy at human rights group Justice , said : " This is clearly a worrying trend – coercive police powers should be confined to the police because they are properly trained and can be held accountable .
" People know that police officers , and to some degree community support officers , have these powers , but one need only consider the hostility directed to traffic wardens to appreciate the public 's unwillingness to accept the use of intrusive powers by council employees .
This could lead to dangerous situations of confrontation . "
Under the Community Safety Accreditation Scheme ( CSAS ) , the number of civilians wearing a special badge and a uniform approved by the local chief constable has risen by 267 to 1,667 in the last year .
One reason for the growth was the decision by the Metropolitan Police to join the scheme introduced by Labour under the Police Reform Act 2002 .
The 30 " accredited " powers include the issuing of a fixed penalty notice for riding a bicycle on a footpath , for littering and to parents of truants .
An accredited civilian also has powers to deal with anti-social behaviour , which include requiring a person to stop drinking in a designated public place and confiscate and dispose of alcohol .
They can also confiscate alcohol and tobacco from young people .
Yesterday the Government defended the policy .
Policing minister David Hanson MP said : " The Community Safety Accreditation Scheme is a key part of the strong action we are taking to crack down on anti-social behaviour and low - level offences .
This has the benefit of not only making our communities better places to live , but also of freeing up police time so officers can focus on the job they do best – tackling crime and protecting the public . "
He added : " [ Yesterday 's ] figures show that police forces are seeing the positive impact of a scheme that underlines our commitment to tackling the local crime and anti-social behaviour issues that matter the most . "
Scotland Yard police can be tested for substance misuse at any time Ten Metropolitan Police officers were caught using illegal drugs including cocaine , heroin and cannabis over the last year , Scotland Yard has said .
Officers employed by the force can be tested for substance and alcohol misuse at any time .
Three officers were found to have taken banned drugs through random tests .
A further seven tested positive after colleagues raised concerns about them .
Met Police released the details after a Freedom of Information Act request .
Three of the officers tested positive for banned drugs - either cocaine , heroin or cannabis - during random testing .
Two resigned and the third was sacked after a hearing .
The Met has a duty of care to its officers , its staff and the people of London
Met Police spokesman
Officials tested a further 11 officers after colleagues grew suspicious that they may be using drugs .
And , of these tests , four individuals tested positive for cannabis and three for cocaine .
Six of those officers resigned , while another is awaiting the outcome of a disciplinary hearing .
The positive results formed a tiny proportion of the 815 random substance misuse tests that took place in the 12 months up to November .
The figures released revealed that there had been 346 random breath tests in the last year - and no - one recorded a positive result .
And 231 pre-employment tests also proved negative .
Drug and alcohol testing was introduced in 2007 after a change in the law enabled random tests of officers in certain roles .
' Healthy workforce '
Applicants for work at the force , probationary officers and specialists with dangerous roles , such as carrying firearms or undercover work , undergo mandatory random tests .
And other officers can be tested when there is a " reasonable suspicion " of substance misuse .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said random drug testing was used to " help create and maintain a healthy workforce " , as well as uphold the force 's integrity .
He went on : " The Met has a duty of care to its officers , its staff and the people of London .
" The purpose of substance misuse testing is to ensure that members of the Met are deterred from engaging in substance misuse and , where individuals place themselves , others and the organisation at risk from such misuse , they are identified and dealt with appropriately . "

MIAMI GARDENS , Fla .  New Orleans Saints linebacker Scott Fujita addresses hot - button issues the way he might meet an opposing running back : directly .
So Fujita was not shy Tuesday about entering two Super Bowl debates that have little to do with his team ’s game Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts .
At issue are two Super Bowl television commercials , one about abortion , the other about gay rights .
The first ad  which will be shown on CBS  is an antiabortion message from Focus on the Family that includes Tim Tebow , the former Heisman Trophy winner from Florida .
The other ad  which was rejected by CBS  is for ManCrunch , a gay dating service .
Fujita has spoken out before in favor of abortion rights and gay rights .
Telco becomes the first ISP to launch a limitless ADSL2 + offering in Australia , but analyst warns of potential business turmoil
AAPT has become Australia ’s first ISP to launch an ADSL 2 + plan with limitless downloads , no capping and no throttling , but at least one expert doubts its veracity .
“ This is a milestone day for Australia as AAPT ’s benchmark decision will force our major competitors to do the same thing , ” AAPT chief executive , Paul Broad , said in a statement .
“ All Australians will benefit from AAPT leading the way with unlimited broadband . ”
Although many other ISPs offer unlimited downloads as part of their broadband Internet plans , most slow down the speeds of users that go over a set limit while others charge fees for extra downloads .
AAPT 's limitless downloads will be available with no service interruptions or peak / off - peak time constraints .
While telecommunications analyst , Paul Budde , said he had n’t completely analysed the terms and conditions of the plan , he doubted both the completeness of the ISP ’s claim and its sustainability as a business model .
“ I ’m a little bit reluctant to comment on this because I would n’t be surprised if there ’s something in the contract that indicates there is some sort of limitation , be it ‘ Fair Use ’ or something else , ” he said .
“ A lot of our content comes from the US and the UK .
These are far away and there are high international costs involved .
This makes it difficult for ISPs to just give uncapped price plans .
“ It ’s often said with high - volume ISPs that it ’s one or two per cent of the customers that account for 50 per cent of the traffic .
Now there ’s no business model that stacks up where you give this enormous amount of capacity away to these people . ”
Budde was happy to see it as a positive move for consumers that may drive other telcos to provide similar offerings , but warned that a lack of limits could lead to AAPT attracting a wave of illegal filesharers and mass - downloaders .
“ It ’s definitely a win for customers .
The more openness and the more freer services there are the better it is .
It stimulates innovation , ” he said .
“ If it ’s a totally unfettered system , what you potentially do is allow the two percent of people misusing it and you attract more of them to your network . ”
To coincide with the new ADSL2 + offering , telco has also formed a partnership with music label , EMI .
It will provide customers with streaming and downloadable songs .
According to Broad , this will help prevent illegal file sharing .
“ As consumers , we all have a moral responsibility to ensure recording artists receive the royalties they rightly deserve and by offering our Entertainment Bundle we ’re encouraging Australians to do the right thing , ” he said .
Users with access to the music subscription will have unlimited song streaming with $ 50 of music downloads per week .
The music comes as MP3 files that can be played in a variety of devices .
The 24/7 Unlimited Broadband plan costs $ 99.95 a month over 24 months with a minimum spend of $ 2398.80 .
The music pack costs an additional $ 17.99 a month over 12 months with a minimum cost of $ 215.88 .

Bill Bailey - echo and The Edge

Bill explores the world of echo , and wonders what the Edge has been playing all these years .
In the wake of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's major speech yesterday on Internet freedom , a speech in which she called out countries like Egypt , Uzbekistan , Vietnam , Iran , and China , most governments have yet to respond .
China , however , was quick to reply after dealing with the Google issue for a week already .
Here 's what has happened in 24 turbulent hours .
Wide open .
It did n't take China long to respond to Clinton 's call to tear down the Great Firewall .
China 's official news agency Xinhua summed up the government response in its headline : " China urges US to stop accusations on so - called Internet freedom . "
Why " so - called " ?
Because the Chinese Internet is open .
Wide open .
" China urged the United States to respect facts and stop unreasonable accusations on China in the name of so - called Internet freedom , " said the article .
It then quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesperson as saying , " The US side had criticized China 's policies on Internet administration , alluding that China restricts Internet freedom .
We firmly oppose such words and deeds , which were against the facts and would harm the China - US relations . "
It 's constitutional .
The Chinese constitution protects freedom of speech , he added — which it does , along with freedom of the press , of association , of religion , of demonstration , and freedom to criticize the government .
The constitution also notes that " work is the glorious duty of every able - bodied citizen . "
Those rights come with some terrific caveats , though .
Religion is fine unless it could " disrupt public order , impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state . "
Privacy is an absolute right except when it's not , such as when " public security or procuratorial organs are permitted to censor correspondence in accordance with procedures prescribed by law . "
Etc .
China insists that its restrictions are all written into law , however , and are therefore legal , which in turn means that they are a simple matter of cultural difference , and foreigners should just stop talking about them and start complying with them .
The reality , as most Internet companies have found , is that censorship can be random , and even major companies never know when Internet services will be blocked and when they wo n't .
Hillary Clinton making her speech at the Newseum
The company you keep .
Journalist James Fallows , just back from three years living in China , was in the audience for Clinton 's speech .
He notes : " Tunisia , Uzbekistan , Vietnam , Egypt — this is not the grouping of countries that the Chinese government , in its recent sense of rise to superpower status , is used to being lumped with .
" Compared to the US as a financial power , OK ; overtaking Japan in economic size , yes ; being a crucial player in environmental negotiations ... all that is one thing .
Bracketed in the same sentence with Tunisia and Uzbekistan is different .
Sentences like this do n't appear in formal , big - deal SecState addresses by accident . "
No exceptions for Google .
On Tuesday , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu discussed the related Google issue during a press conference ... and made it quite clear the government was not ready to open up further at the moment .
" I wish to stress that Internet in China is open and China supervises Internet according to law , " he said .
" The Chinese Government encourages the development and application of Internet .
China is the country with the largest number of Internet users .
Hacking activities in whatever form is strictly prohibited by China 's laws .
Foreign - invested enterprises in China should abide by China 's laws and regulations , respect the interests , culture and traditions of the general public , and assume the corresponding social responsibilities .
Google is no exception .
China firmly adheres to the policy of opening up and will continue its effort to create a sound environment for foreign enterprises in China including Internet corporations and ensure their legitimate rights and interests . "
We hate hacking , too .
Ma also stressed that China itself was a victim of hacking .
" It 's fair to say that China is the biggest victim of hacking , " he added .
" In China , eight out of ten computers connected with Internet are once hijacked by hackers . "
That number , if true , makes the mind boggle when it ponders the size of the botnets that must exist using those machines .
What no one seems to be saying officially is that , while China 's government may in fact be linked to the super - sophisticated attacks on Google and 30 other companies , it 's inconceivable that US spooks are n't engaged in a similar exercise — though the goal of such work may well be different .
Obama wants answers .
A day after Clinton 's speech , Obama made clear that his Secretary of State was n't " going rogue " by being too direct with countries like China .
Obama spokesperson Bill Burton said today that his boss is " troubled " by the cyberattacks on Google and wants " answers " from the Chinese government .
Remove the plank from thine own eye !
While most commentators seem to be praising Clinton 's vision , plenty ask if the US actually lives up to the ideals it is setting for others .
This mood is captured by bloggers like Chris Marsden , a University of Essex ( UK ) law professor , who writes :
So do we want the home of the NSA , the Patriot [ sic ]
Act and most of the surveillance - intelligence complex lecturing the rest of us on free speech while licensing the flogging of blade servers and other DPI kit to friends , Romans and Chinamen ?
It 's a point made robustly by Rebecca McKinnon and Ian Brown , who points out the nasties perpetrated by Yahoo ! and Microsoft back in the day .
Watching Clinton in Baku .
US embassies , like the one in Uzbekistan , are promoting Clinton 's speech on their websites .
In Azerbaijan , the embassy showed the speech and then hosted a discussion afterwards with Azerbaijani journalists .
Awkward questions .
In Lebanon , the speech is the main item on the US embassy 's website .
But when the embassy organized its own discussion of the speech with local journalists , it found itself on the receiving end of questions involving freedom of expression .
The local issue is al - Manar TV , a station run by Hizbullah in Lebanon .
The US considers Hizbullah a terrorist organization .
Journalists wanted to know about a new bill ( PDF ) that just passed the US House of Representatives and targets al - Manar ( along with al - Aqsa and al - Zawra , which are run by other groups such as Hamas ) as " Specially Designated Global Terrorists satellite providers . "
The local US public affairs officer stressed that the bill was not a law , that the Obama administration had no position on it yet , but that the US government does n't see a difference between a designated terrorist group and that group 's TV station .
As for al - Manar , last month the TV station railed against the bill .
" Democracy and Freedom of Expression are two ' slogans ' that have always been used by the United States in its " campaign " against the Arab world ...
Yet , democracy and freedom of expression seem to be just another American ' illusion ' and ' fantasy . ' "
In today ’s world of interactive web - based marketing , viral campaigns and high production television commercials , the print ad remains one very powerful and effective means for advertisers to reach their audience .
The printed format , whether it is for magazines , newspapers or billboards , sets specific challenges for ad designers .
An idea or message must be communicated simply and swiftly , it must be eye - catching enough to grab the viewer ’s attention and convey the important information in an instant .
When a print designer employs humour to carry this information , the result can be become a visual ‘ one - liner ’ , a joke that speaks the message the ad intends .

Secular campaigners publish series of anti-religious quotes and say they will challenge law if charged with blasphemy
Secular campaigners in the Irish Republic defied a strict new blasphemy law which came into force today by publishing a series of anti-religious quotations online and promising to fight the legislation in court .
The new law , which was passed in July , means that blasphemy in Ireland is now a crime punishable with a fine of up to € 25,000 ( £ 22,000 ) .
It defines blasphemy as " publishing or uttering matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters sacred by any religion , thereby intentionally causing outrage among a substantial number of adherents of that religion , with some defences permitted " .
The justice minister , Dermot Ahern , said that the law was necessary because while immigration had brought a growing diversity of religious faiths , the 1936 constitution extended the protection of belief only to Christians .
But Atheist Ireland , a group that claims to represent the rights of atheists , responded to the new law by publishing 25 anti-religious quotations on its website , from figures including Richard Dawkins , Björk , Frank Zappa and the former Observer editor and Irish ex-minister Conor Cruise O'Brien .
Michael Nugent , the group 's chair , said that it would challenge the law through the courts if it were charged with blasphemy .
Nugent said : " This new law is both silly and dangerous .
It is silly because medieval religious laws have no place in a modern secular republic , where the criminal law should protect people and not ideas .
And it is dangerous because it incentives religious outrage , and because Islamic states led by Pakistan are already using the wording of this Irish law to promote new blasphemy laws at UN level .
" We believe in the golden rule : that we have a right to be treated justly , and that we have a responsibility to treat other people justly .
Blasphemy laws are unjust : they silence people in order to protect ideas .
In a civilised society , people have a right to express and to hear ideas about religion even if other people find those ideas to be outrageous . "
He said that despite the published quotations being abusive and insulting in relation to matters held sacred by various religions , Atheist Ireland " unreservedly support the right of these people to have published or uttered them , and we unreservedly support the right of any Irish citizen to make comparable statements about matters held sacred by any religion without fear of being criminalised , and without having to prove to a court that a reasonable person would find any particular value in the statement " .
Nugent said that the group would be prepared to take on the state if anyone complained about the quotes and that the campaign to repeal the law was part of a wider battle to create a more secular republic .
" You would think that after all the scandals the Catholic church endured in 2009 the introduction of a blasphemy law would be the last thing that the Irish state would be considering in terms of defending religion and its place in society .
" We ask Fianna Fáil and the Green party to repeal their anachronistic blasphemy law , as part of the revision of the defamation act that is included within the act .
We ask them to hold a referendum to remove the reference to blasphemy from the Irish constitution . "
" We also ask all TDs and senators to support a referendum to remove references to God from the Irish constitution , including the clauses that prevent atheists from being appointed as president of Ireland or as a judge without swearing a religious oath asking God to direct them in their work . "
God noes
Richard Dawkins : " The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction : jealous and proud of it ; a petty , unjust , unforgiving control freak ; a vindictive , bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser ; a misogynistic , homophobic , racist , infanticidal , genocidal , filicidal , pestilential , megalomaniacal , sadomasochistic , capriciously malevolent bully . "
Björk : " The Buddhists say we come back as animals and they refer to them as lesser beings .
Well , animals are n't lesser beings , they 're just like us .
So I say fuck the Buddhists . "
Frank Zappa : " To hang all this desperate sociology on the idea of The Cloud Guy who has The Big Book , who knows if you 've been bad or good – and cares about any of it – is the chimpanzee part of the brain working . "
Mr King said surplus countries around the world are not stimulating enough to offset belt - tightening by deficit states such as the UK , US and Spain , citing the eurozone as a " microcosm " of the problem .
" I was struck by the mood at the G7 meeting in Canada , where several of the major economies around the world said quite openly that they were relying on external demand growth to generate growth in their economy .
That can't be true of everybody , " he said .
WARSAW ( Reuters ) - Poland ’s tax office has levied a fine of 2.3 million zlotys ( 507,000 pounds ) on an unemployed woman for failing to pay tax on income worth at least 13.7 million zlotys she said she had earned as a prostitute .
The woman told the tax office in the southern city of Katowice that she had very “ generous ” customers , the website gazeta.pl , which is linked to leading Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza , reported on Tuesday .
One of her clients paid the woman 5 million zlotys during the 1997 - 2002 period , she was quoted as saying .
The website gave no further details .
The UFC ’s first live event on Versus , Ultimate Fight Night 21 on March 21st looks like it ’s well on it ’s way to being a stacked card .
We already know that it will be headlined by Jon Jones Vs Brandon Vera , backed up by a co-main event featuring Junior Dos Santos and Gabe Gonzaga .
Now fightersonly have suggested that the latest winner of The Ultimate Fighter reality show , Roy Nelson ( 6ft / 265lbs ) , is set to be matched with up and coming heavyweight prospect Stefan Struve ( 6ft 11 ″ / 247lbs ) .
Nelson is of course a veteran of the sport with a record of 14 - 4 , his latest victory coming in his official octagon debut against Brendan Schaub to become the TUF 10 winner .
Struve failed to impress in his UFC debut against Junior Dos Santos , losing in under a minute , but the 21 year old has since shown himself to have promise thanks to three back - to - back wins , with the latest being a decision win over another veteran , Paul Buentello .
It ’s a step up in competition for Nelson compared to the fighters he fought on the reality show , but it ’s still a fight he will believe he can win .
Struve has found most success with his submissions so far in his career , but he ’ll find that tough to implement against Nelson , a BJJ black belt who has competed at the prestigious ADCC event .
Nelson ’s heavy hands will also be a concern for the Dutch fighter , who will look to use his superior reach to his advantage .
‘ The Skyscraper ’ is still a work in progress this early in his career though , learning and improving on his skill - set with every fight , and if he could defeat ‘ Big Country ’ it would be a major boost for his career .

In other UFN 21 news , a heavily rumored fight between Clay Guida and Sean Sherk has been scrapped according to the fiveouncesofpain site .
It ’s disappointing as it would have been an interesting encounter between two of the lightweight divisions most relentless competitors .
Instead mmajunkie are now reporting that Shannon Gugerty will now replace Sherk instead .
12 - 4 in his mixed martial arts career , Gugerty is currently 2 - 2 in the UFC and is coming off a loss to Terry Etim at UFC 105 .
Guida is also looking to get back to winning ways after losing to Kenny Florian in December at UFC 107 , leaving the fan favorite ’s UFC record at 5 - 5 .

Here 's more fodder for people that believe bankers control the world .
TheStreet.com has an email from June 2008 that raises anti-trust questions for regulators .
In the email , JPMorgan appears to collude with Santander not to compete with each other to purchase for troubled banks during the financial crisis in 2008 .
TheStreet.com :
Written by Jose Cerezo , an investment banker at JPMorgan , the e-mail describes the two bank bosses and a Santander executive board member , Juan Inciarte , talking about several possible acquisitions of interest to both banks at the time , including WaMu , Suntrust , PNC Financial , and Wachovia ( which was eventually acquired by Wells Fargo ) .
" It is important to have an open dialogue with them , as Santander would not pursue any of these opportunities if JPMorgan were to do the same ( ca n't compete on price with JPMorgan for an acquisition in the USA ) .
But Santander would probably hire JPMorgan as advisor if we are not going after them , " Cerezo writes .
Of course , this might not be a violation of antitrust laws if no actual agreement was reached .
But it certainly implies an anti-competitive spirit at work in the banking M&A market .
Representatives from JPMorgan , Santander , and the Department of Justice declined comment for the story , written by Dan Freed .

Ever wonder how , on the " nutritional label " on the bags , junk foods like Tostitos can somehow masquerade as diet friendly ?
That 's because the " serving size " the label describes would n't satisfy an infant .
Thankfully , in the latest bid to make our citizens less humongous , the FDA may finally address that ...
William Neuman , New York Times :
Seeking a new weapon in the fight against obesity , the Food and Drug Administration wants to encourage manufacturers to post vital nutritional information , including calorie counts , on the front of food packages .
The goal is to give people a jolt of reality before they reach for another handful of chips .
But the urgency of the message could be muted by a longstanding problem : official serving sizes for many packaged foods are just too small .
And that means the calorie counts that go with them are often misleading .

So topical , yet so sad .
Anyway , there are a number of space station concepts from the past century , and while none saw the light of day , some of their features did , and could even help astronauts on missions to the Moon and Mars , if they ever happen .
There 's artificial gravity , for instance , which many scientists agree will be important if we 're to travel to Mars and beyond .
It was first imagined as far back as 1929 .

George Lucas , you got some splaining to do !
[ Scienceray via Neatorama ]
A Chinese human rights activist , Feng Zhenghu , has been camping out , sleeping on a bench and surviving on handouts at the Narita International Airport in Japan since Nov. 4 , 2009 .
No , this is not a remake of the film “ The Terminal ” with Tom Hanks starring as a man with no country , it ’s a real - life situation .
What ’s at stake are individual rights to due process and the right of Chinese citizens not to be intimidated by their own government .
Mr. Feng ’s protest exposes the insecurity that is haunting the emerging superpower that is China – and is helping the international community see that this Communist government is trampling on its own laws and Constitution .
It ’s also helped inspire – and bring international attention – to the plight of hundreds of exiled Chinese in the United States , Japan , and Europe , including the author of this article , who has also been deprived of the right to go home .
Feng ’s story
After the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989 , Feng openly criticized the repression and was under investigation for more than a year .
He studied in Japan and returned to China but was detained and sentenced to three years in prison for what he has called “ trumped - up charges of illegal business activity . ”
Last year , Feng visited his sister in Japan , and when he was ready to go home to Shanghai , the Chinese government denied him entry .
After eight failed attempts to return , despite having a valid visa for Japan , he has decided to protest at the airport and wait for the Chinese government to change its mind .
Others in exile
I came to the US on a Niemann Fellowship at Harvard University in 1997 and stayed to pursue an advanced degree in law .
Before my Chinese passport expired in 2002 , I went to have it renewed but my request was rejected .
When I called to seek an explanation , an official left me a voice mail , saying that I “ should be able to figure out the reason for the rejection . ”
I had been imprisoned for two years in China before my arrival in the US .
Certainly my leadership role in the 1989 pro-democracy movement and my ensuing criticism of the Chinese government were key contributing factors .
Consequently , I , too , have become one of many Chinese banished unjustly .
In the past nine years , I have written to China ’s legislature and the Chinese government .
My many petitions have gone unanswered .
Without a passport , I have n’t been able to travel outside the US , let alone visit my family and relatives in China .
China has effectively kept political dissidents out of the country and discouraged antigovernment activities abroad by refusing to renew passports for Chinese citizens , rejecting visa applications from activists who are naturalized American citizens or granting residents such as Feng and myself the right to leave the country but then denying them reentry .
To fight for their right to return home , affected Chinese citizens in the West have tried almost everything .
They have launched petitions and staged hunger strikes and protests in front of Chinese embassies .
Some have even kept silent , hoping to quietly negotiate their way back home .
So far , that has n’t worked .
In 2002 , Yang Jianli , a Chinese scholar and human rights activist , used an altered passport to board a flight and managed to get back into China .
He was soon captured and thrown in a Chinese jail for five years .
Before his death in 2005 , exiled writer Liu Bingyan had contacted the Chinese authorities , begging to go home for cancer treatment .
The government turned him down and he died in a foreign land .
Consistently met with such failure , those in exile had all but given up the fight to return home .
But , through his heroic effort , Feng has energized a “ return home movement ” for Chinese exiles all over the world .
He has found a perfect international venue , free of the harassment from Chinese police and free from the threat of Chinese prisons .
He has attracted attention from inside as well as outside China .
At the airport , passing passengers hear about his story and give him water and food .
Chinese activists from Hong Kong and the US fly in to bring supplies and offer him encouragement .
Several technology experts inside China secretly helped him set up a Twitter account so he could broadcast his situation .
He has received thousands of Twitter and text messages from well - wishers throughout the world .
The Chinese government has not yet responded nor has it offered any concessions , but with the increasing media coverage the pressure is building .
Significantly , the issue was brought up by reporters at a recent Chinese Foreign Ministry press conference .
It would n’t be too difficult to lift the ban and allow Feng to go home .
What the Chinese leadership fear is that any concession regarding Feng will open a floodgate for hundreds of other Chinese like me who are stuck in a similar limbo .
Allowing activists to return home could mean more threats to a regime that has been built on suppression and persecution .
But since the issue has come to the forefront of human rights campaigns , inaction could pose problems for China on the international scene .
Feng ’s brave efforts have ignited hope among those in exile of a change in the Chinese government .
His high - profile protest will no doubt only increase .
China cannot emerge as a respected international voice if those who have unjustly been forced into exile or prison continue to be a thorn in its side .
Chinese in exile must fight until the day when we are allowed to go back to our home country and reunite with our families .

WHEN the 2010 Yellow Pages landed on John Cully 's Normanhurst doorstep last month , he knew exactly what to do with it .
" It went straight into the recycling bin , " Mr Cully said .
" Like the White Pages a few months before , it did n't make it indoors . "
Mr Cully 's experience is a common one .
Although the internet has rendered them obsolete to many , over 20 million of the white and yellow tomes are delivered to houses and businesses each year .
About 2 million go into recycling bins , said a study by CoreData last year .
The study also found that 58 per cent of people would stop having the Yellow Pages delivered if given the choice .
Sensis , the Telstra - owned entity that distributes the books , disputes these findings .
Their data , collected by Roy Morgan , suggests more than 8 million people use a White or Yellow Pages each week .
A poll finds that 49 percent of Americans trusted Fox News , 10 percentage points more than any other network .
Poll :
Fox most trusted name in news
Fox is the most trusted television news network in the country , according to a new poll out Tuesday .
A Public Policy Polling nationwide survey of 1,151 registered voters Jan. 18- 19 found that 49 percent of Americans trusted Fox News , 10 percentage points more than any other network .

Thirty - seven percent said they did n’t trust Fox , also the lowest level of distrust that any of the networks recorded .
There was a strong partisan split among those who said they trusted Fox — with 74 percent of Republicans saying they trusted the network , while only 30 percent of Democrats said they did .
CNN was the second - most - trusted network , getting the trust of 39 percent of those polled .
Forty - one percent said they did n’t trust CNN .
Each of the three major networks was trusted by less than 40 percent of those surveyed , with NBC ranking highest at 35 percent .
Forty - four percent said they did not trust NBC , which was combined with its sister cable station MSNBC .
Thirty - two percent of respondents said they trusted CBS , while 31 percent trusted ABC .
Both CBS and ABC were not trusted by 46 percent of those polled .
“ A generation ago you would have expected Americans to place their trust in the most neutral and unbiased conveyors of news , ” said PPP President Dean Debnam in his analysis of the poll .
“ But the media landscape has really changed , and now they ’re turning more toward the outlets that tell them what they want to hear . ”
The telephone poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points .

Early estimates for fourth - quarter PC sales are in , painting a much rosier picture than the past several quarters .
Even Dell , which had a significant drop in market share for 2009 , managed to turn in a slight increase in unit shipments for the fourth quarter .
Meanwhile , HP moves into the top spot in the US , while Apple , despite showing an increase in units shipped , moved down to number five .
Dell also took a hit worldwide , being bumped from the number two spot by Acer .
In the US , PC shipments were up 25 percent for the quarter , and about 6 percent overall for the entire year .
That contrasts sharply with the doom and gloom expected for the year as an effect of the recession , with huge holiday sales preventing the year from ending on a sour note .
HP has succeeded in solidifying its lead over previous sales king Dell .
The company had tremendous fourth quarter growth of 45.5 percent , earning the company nearly 30 percent of the US market .
HP 's 15 percent growth in unit shipments for the year puts it in the number one spot for all of 2009 , at 26.9 percent share .
Second - place
Dell continued to slide , meanwhile , even while recording a small positive growth in shipments for the fourth quarter .
It has dipped below a quarter of the US PC market for the first time in a very long time .
It finished the year down 11.3 percent in shipments , to hold 24.5 percent of the market for 2009 .
Acer and Toshiba both saw huge gains for the fourth quarter , recording unit shipments gains of 33.4 percent and a whopping 71.1 percent respectively .
Acer , most well known for its line of inexpensive netbook and " nettop " machines , solidified itself in the number three spot in the US .
Toshiba , meanwhile , pushed itself past Apple to grab the number four spot in the fourth quarter .
Both companies also had healthy double - digit growth in shipments for the year as well .
" Shipment growth was largely driven by low - priced consumer mobile PCs , both in regular notebooks and [ netbooks ] , " Mikako Kitagawa , principal analyst at Gartner , said in a statement .
" As economic weakness continued , buyers became extremely price sensitive .
Low - priced PCs were good enough for many average consumers . "
The result is that some manufacturers made what Gartner describes as " damaging price cuts " to lure consumers .
The story was quite different for Apple .
The preliminary results show that the company had healthy growth in the fourth quarter , with unit shipments up 27 percent .
But that barely made a difference against the huge gains of Toshiba ; despite edging its market share up ever so slightly to 7.4 percent , it fell to fifth place in the US .
However , Apple has still commanded premium pricing throughout the economic downturn , keeping its profits intact .
" Apple does not have much presence in the professional market where the growth was still slow , " Kitagawa told Ars .
" Therefore , Apple did not have a negative impact from the weak professional market . "
Most growth was fueled from the consumer market , where Apple already has a strong presence , she said .
" Apple 's profits from Mac sales are one of the best among all PC vendors , " Kitagawa continued .
" While enjoying good profits , there is no need for them to cut prices . "
On the global scene , shipments were up 18.6 percent for the fourth quarter , again fueled by aggressive price cuts aimed squarely at cash - strapped consumers .
Growth came mainly from the US and a recovering Asia .
Europe , Middle East , and Africa are trailing somewhat , due in part to a later onset of recession conditions .
Shipments were up just under 4 percent for the year ; again , a much better result than what was predicted from earlier this year .
For the fourth quarter , HP , Acer , Lenovo , and Toshiba all had impressive gains in unit shipments .
Dell again managed a small 5 percent bump in units , though its market share dropped slightly .
The rest of the top five worlwide PC vendors managed small gains in market share , though nothing significant enough to shake up the overall ranking .
For 2009 , HP , Lenovo , and Toshiba all had decent double - digit growth .
The big upset came from Acer , which managed to post a 26 percent growth for the year to jump ahead of Dell as the number - two worldwide PC vendor .
Dell turned in a lackluster 9.2 percent drop in shipments for 2009 , moving down to number three .
" The market has weathered a storm which looks to be behind us , " says Jay Chou , IDC research analyst .
" But salvaging decreasing margins will soon become even more pertinent as one considers the long - term effects of holding market share at the cost of profitability .
Without an effective strategy to convey a clear usage model and feature set tied to each segment , the market will inevitably continue down the slippery slope of ' good - enough ' computing sold to the lowest bidder . "
Note :
The data used for this report comes from preliminary figures supplied by both Gartner and IDC .
Figures for fourth quarter US , fourth quarter worldwide , and 2009 worldwide sales are averaged from Gartner and IDC data , though there were no major differences in those data sets .
Figures for 2009 US PC sales were only provided by IDC .
Introduction : General Idea of the Revolution in the 21st Century
“ But then came Proudhon : the son of a peasant , and , by his works and instinct , a hundred times more revolutionary than all the doctrinaire and bourgeois Socialists , he equipped himself with a critical point of view , as ruthless as it was profound and penetrating , in order to destroy all their systems .
Opposing liberty to authority , he boldly proclaimed himself an Anarchist by way of setting forth his ideas in contradistinction to those of the State Socialists . ” Michael Bakunin[ 1 ]
In 1840 , two short expressions , a mere seven words , transformed socialist politics forever .
One , only four words long , put a name to a tendency within the working class movement : “ I am an Anarchist . ”
The other , only three words long , presented a critique and a protest against inequality which still rings : “ Property is Theft ! ”
Their author , Pierre - Joseph Proudhon ( 1809 - 1865 ) , was a self - educated son of a peasant family and his work , What Is Property ? , ensured he became one of the leading socialist thinkers of the nineteenth century .
From his works and activity , the libertarian [ 2 ] movement was born : that form of socialism based on “ the denial of Government and of Property . ” [ 3 ]
It would be no exaggeration to state that if you do not consider property as “ theft ” and “ despotism ” and oppose it along with the state then you are not a libertarian .
As George Woodcock summarised :
“ What is Property ?
embraces the core of nineteenth century anarchism ... all the rest of later anarchism is there , spoken or implied : the conception of a free society united by association , of workers controlling the means of production .
Later Proudhon was to elaborate other aspects : the working class political struggle as a thing of its own , federalism and decentralism as a means of re-shaping society , the commune and the industrial association as the important units of human intercourse , the end of frontiers and nations .
But What is Property ?... remains the foundation on which the whole edifice of nineteenth century anarchist theory was to be constructed . ” [ 4 ]
Michael Bakunin , who considered the “ illustrious and heroic socialist ” [ 5 ] as a friend , proclaimed that “ Proudhon is the master of us all . ” [ 6 ]
For Peter Kropotkin , the leading theoretician of communist - anarchism of his day , Proudhon laid “ the foundations of Anarchism ” [ 7 ] and became a socialist after reading his work .
Benjamin Tucker , America ’s foremost individualist anarchist thinker , considered Proudhon as both “ the father of the Anarchistic school of socialism ” and “ the Anarchist par excellence . ” [ 8 ]
Alexander Herzen , leading populist thinker and father of Russian socialism , praised Proudhon ’s “ powerful and vigorous thought ” and stated his “ works constitute a revolution in the history not only of socialism but also French logic . ” [ 9 ]
Leo Tolstoy greatly admired and was heavily influenced by Proudhon , considering his “ property is theft ” as “ an absolute truth ” which would “ survive as long as humanity . ” [ 10 ]
For leading anarcho - syndicalist thinker Rudolf Rocker , Proudhon was “ one of the most intellectually gifted and certainly the most many - sided writer of whom modern socialism can boast . ” [ 11 ]
Historian Robert Tomes notes that Proudhon was “ the greatest intellectual influence on French socialism ” whose “ ideas had durable influence on the working - class elite ” [ 12 ] while Julian P. W. Archer considered him “ the pre-eminent socialist of mid-nineteenth century France . ” [ 13 ]
Sharif Gemie recounts that for many workers in France “ Proudhon was the living symbol of working class self - emancipation . ” [ 14 ]
His ideas “ anticipated all those later movements in France which , like the revolutionary syndicalists during the late nineteenth century and the students of 1968 , demanded l’autogestion ouvrière .
Their joint demand was that the economy be controlled neither by private enterprise nor by the state ( whether democratic or totalitarian ) , but by the producers . ” [ 15 ]
Even Friedrich Engels had to admit that Proudhon had “ a preponderating place among the French Socialists of his epoch . ” [ 16 ]
The aim of this anthology is to show why Proudhon influenced so many radicals and revolutionaries , why Proudhon should be read today .
His work marks the beginning of anarchism as a named socio-economic theory and the libertarian ideas Proudhon championed ( such as anti-statism , anti-capitalism , self - management , possession , socialisation , communal - economic federalism , decentralisation , and so forth ) are as important today as they were in the 19th century .
Anarchism did not spring ready - made from Proudhon ’s head in 1840 .
Nor , for that matter , did Proudhon ’s own ideas !
This is to be expected : he was breaking new ground in terms of theory , creating the foundations upon which other anarchists would build .
His ideas developed and evolved as he thought through the implications of his previous insights .
Certain ideas mentioned in passing in earlier works ( such as workers ’ self - management ) come to the fore later , while others ( such as federalism ) are discussed years after What Is Property ?.
His ideas also reflected , developed and changed with the social and political context ( most notably , the 1848 revolution and its aftermath ) .
However , “ contrary to persistent legend , Proudhon was not the egregious eccentric who continually contradicted himself ...
Proudhon had a consistent vision of society and its need ... which revolves around his desire to instil a federal arrangement of workers ’ associations and to instil a public regard for republican virtue . ” [ 17 ]
Regardless of the attempts by both the propertarian right and the authoritarian left to reduce it simply to opposition to the state , anarchism has always presented a critique of state and property as well as other forms of oppression . [ 18 ]
All are interrelated and cannot be separated without making a mockery of libertarian analysis and history :
“ Capital ... in the political field is analogous to government ...
The economic idea of capitalism , the politics of government or of authority , and the theological idea of the Church are three identical ideas , linked in various ways .
To attack one of them is equivalent to attacking all of them ...
What capital does to labour , and the State to liberty , the Church does to the spirit .
This trinity of absolutism is as baneful in practice as it is in philosophy .
The most effective means for oppressing the people would be simultaneously to enslave its body , its will and its reason . ” [ 19 ]
Proudhon ’s two key economic ideas are free credit and workers associations .
To quote economist John Kenneth Galbraith ’s excellent summary :
“ Scholars have regularly assigned Proudhon a position of importance in the history of socialism , syndicalism and anarchism but not in the history of economic theory .
It is a distinction without merit .
Two ideas of influence can be found in the modern residue of Proudhon ’s theories .
One is the belief , perhaps the instinct , that there is a certain moral superiority in the institution of the co-operative .
Or the worker - owned plant .
When farmers unite to supply themselves with fertilisers , oil or other farm supplies , and consumers to provide themselves with groceries , the ideas of Proudhon are heard in praise .
So also when steel workers come together to take over and run a senescent mill ...
And Proudhon is one among many parents of the continuing faith in monetary magic – of the belief that great reforms can be accomplished by hitherto undiscovered designs for financial or monetary innovation or manipulation . ” [ 20 ]
In terms of politics , his vision was one of federations of self - governing communities .
He repeatedly stressed the importance of decentralisation and autonomy to ensure effective liberty for the people .
“ Among these liberties , ” Proudhon argued , “ one of the most important is that of the commune . ”
A country “ by its federations , by municipal and provincial independence ... attested its local liberties , corollary and complement of the liberty of the citizen .
Without the liberty of the commune , the individual is only half free , the feudal yoke is only half broken , public right is equivocal , public integrity is comprised . ” [ 21 ]
This socio-economic vision he called “ mutualism , ” a term Proudhon did not invent . [ 22 ]
The workers organisations in Lyon , where Proudhon stayed in 1843 , were described as mutuel­lisme and mutuelliste in the 1830s .
There is “ close similarity between the associational ideal of Proudhon ... and the program of the Lyon Mutualists ” and it is “ likely that Proudhon was able to articulate his positive program more coherently because of the example of the silk workers of Lyon .
The socialist ideal that he championed was already being realised , to a certain extent , by such workers . ” [ 23 ]
In short , Proudhon “ was working actively to replace capitalist statism with an anti-state socialism in which workers manage their own affairs without exploitation or subordination by a ‘ revolution from below . ’ ” [ 24 ]
Proudhon ’s analysis of property was seminal .
The distinction he made between use rights and property rights , possession and property , laid the ground for both libertarian and Marxist communist perspectives .
It also underlay his analysis of exploitation and his vision of a libertarian society .
Even Marx admitted its power :
“ Proudhon makes a critical investigation – the first resolute , ruthless , and at the same time scientific investigation – of the basis of political economy , private property .
This is the great scientific advance he made , an advance which revolutionises political economy and for the first time makes a real science of political economy possible . ” [ 25 ]
Proudhon ’s critique rested on two key concepts .
Firstly , property allowed the owner to exploit its user ( “ property is theft ” [ 26 ] ) .
Secondly , that property created authoritarian and oppressive social relationships between the two ( “ property is despotism ” ) .
These are interrelated , as it is the relations of oppression that property creates which allows exploitation to happen and the appropriation of our common heritage by the few gives the rest little alternative but to agree to such domination and let the owner appropriate the fruits of their labour .
Proudhon ’s genius and the power of his critique was that he took all the defences of , and apologies for , property and showed that , logically , they could be used to attack that institution .
By treating them as absolute and universal as its apologists treated property itself , he showed that they undermined property rather than supported it . [ 27 ]
To claims that property was a natural right , he explained that the essence of such rights was their universality and that private property ensured that this right could not be extended to all .
To those who argued that property was required to secure liberty , Proudhon rightly objected that “ if the liberty of man is sacred , it is equally sacred in all individuals ; that , if it needs property for its objective action , that is , for its life , the appropriation of material is equally necessary for all . ” [ 28 ]
To claims that labour created property , he noted that most people have no property to labour on and the product of such labour was owned by capitalists and landlords rather than the workers who created it .
As for occupancy , he argued that most owners do not occupy all the property they own while those who do use and occupy it do not own it .
Proudhon showed that the defenders of property had to choose between self - interest and principle , between hypocrisy and logic .
If it is right for the initial appropriation of resources to be made ( by whatever preferred rationale ) then , by that very same reason , it is right for others in the same and subsequent generations to abolish private property in favour of a system which respects the liberty of all rather than a few ( “ If the right of life is equal , the right of labour is equal , and so is the right of occupancy . ” )
This means that “ those who do not possess today are proprietors by the same title as those who do possess ; but instead of inferring therefrom that property should be shared by all , I demand , in the name of general security , its entire abolition . ” [ 29 ]
For Proudhon , the notion that workers are free when capitalism forces them to seek employment was demonstrably false .
He was well aware that in such circumstances property “ violates equality by the rights of exclusion and increase , and freedom by despotism . ”
It has “ perfect identity with robbery ” and the worker “ has sold and surrendered his liberty ” to the proprietor .
Anarchy was “ the absence of a master , of a sovereign ” while proprietor was “ synonymous ” with “ sovereign ” for he “ imposes his will as law , and suffers neither contradiction nor control . ”
Thus “ property is despotism ” as “ each proprietor is sovereign lord within the sphere of his property ” [ 30 ] and so freedom and property were incompatible :
“ The civilised labourer who bakes a loaf that he may eat a slice of bread , who builds a palace that he may sleep in a stable , who weaves rich fabrics that he may dress in rags , who produces every thing that he may dispense with every thing , — is not free .
His employer , not becoming his associate in the exchange of salaries or services which takes place between them , is his enemy . ” [ 31 ]
Hence the pressing need , if we really seek liberty for all , to abolish property and the authoritarian social relationships it generates .
With wage - workers and tenants , property is “ the right to use [ something ] by his neighbour ’s labour ” and so resulted in “ the exploitation of man by man ” for to “ live as a proprietor , or to consume without producing , it is necessary , then , to live upon the labour of another . ” [ 32 ]
Proudhon ’s aim “ was to rescue the working masses from capitalist exploitation . ” [ 33 ]
However , his analysis of exploitation has been misunderstood and , in the case of Marxists , distorted .
J.E. King ’s summary is sadly typical :
“ Marx ’s main priority was to confront those ‘ utopian ’ socialists ( especially ... Proudhon in France ) who saw inequality of exchange as the only source of exploitation , and believed that the establishment of equal exchange in isolation from changes in production relations was sufficient in itself to eliminate all sources of income other than the performance of labour ...
[ Marx proved that ] exploitation in production was sufficient to explain the existence of non-wage incomes . ” [ 34 ]
Yet anyone familiar with Proudhon ’s ideas would know that he was well aware that exploitation occurred at the point of production .
Like Marx , but long before him , Proudhon argued that workers produced more value than they received in wages :
“ Whoever labours becomes a proprietor ...
And when I say proprietor , I do not mean simply ( as do our hypocritical economists ) proprietor of his allowance , his salary , his wages , – I mean proprietor of the value he creates , and by which the master alone profits ...
The labourer retains , even after he has received his wages , a natural right in the thing he has produced . ” [ 35 ]
Property meant “ another shall perform the labour while [ the proprietor ] receives the product . ”
Thus the “ free worker produces ten ; for me , thinks the proprietor , he will produce twelve ” and thus to “ satisfy property , the labourer must first produce beyond his needs . ” [ 36 ]
This is why “ property is theft ! ” [ 37 ]
Proudhon linked rising inequality to the hierarchical relationship of the capitalist workplace :
“ I have shown the contractor , at the birth of industry , negotiating on equal terms with his comrades , who have since become his workmen .
It is plain , in fact , that this original equality was bound to disappear through the advantageous position of the master and the dependence of the wage - workers . ” [ 38 ]
Thus unequal exchange did not explain exploitation , rather the hierarchical relationship produced by wage - labour does .
This can be seen from another key aspect of Proudhon ’s analysis , what he termed “ collective force . ”
This was “ [ o ] ne of the reasons Proudhon gave for rejecting ‘ property ’ [ and ] was to become an important motif of subsequent socialist thought ” , namely that “ collective endeavours produced an additional value ” which was “ unjustly appropriated by the proprietaire . ” [ 39 ]
To quote Proudhon :
“ It is an economic power of which I was , I believe , the first to accentuate the importance , in my first memoir upon Property [ in 1840 ] .
A hundred men , uniting or combining their forces , produce , in certain cases , not a hundred times , but two hundred , three hundred , a thousand times as much .
This is what I have called collective force .
I even drew from this an argument ... that it is not sufficient to pay merely the wages of a given number of workmen , in order to acquire their product legitimately ; that they must be paid twice , thrice or ten times their wages , or an equivalent service rendered to each one of them . ” [ 40 ]
Proudhon ’s “ position that property is theft locates a fundamental antagonism between producers and owners at the heart of modern society .
If the direct producers are the sole source of social value which the owners of capital are expropriating , then exploitation must be the root cause of ... inequality . ”
He “ located the ‘ power to produce without working ’ at the heart of the system ’s exploitation and difficulties very early , anticipating what Marx and Engels were later to call the appropriation of surplus value . ” [ 41 ]
So even a basic awareness of Proudhon ’s ideas would be sufficient to recognise as nonsense Marxist claims that he thought exploitation “ did not occur in the labour process ” and so “ must come from outside of the commercial or capitalist relations , through force and fraud ” or that Marx “ had a very different analysis which located exploitation at the very heart of the capitalist production process . ” [ 42 ]
Proudhon thought exploitation was inherent in wage - labour and occurred at the point of production . [ 43 ]
Unsurprisingly , he sought a solution there .
Given an analysis of property that showed that it produced exploitation ( “ theft ” ) and oppression ( “ despotism ” ) , the question of how to end it arises .
There are two options :
Either abolish collective labour and return to small - scale production or find a new form of economic organisation which ensures that collective labour is neither exploited nor oppressed .
The notion that Proudhon advocated the first solution , a return to pre-capitalist forms of economy , is sadly all too common .
Beginning with Marx , this notion has been vigorously propagated by Marxists with Engels in 1891 proclaiming Proudhon “ the socialist of the small peasant or master craftsman . ” [ 44 ]
The reality is different :
“ On this issue , it is necessary to emphasise that , contrary to the general image given in the secondary literature , Proudhon was not hostile to large industry .
Clearly , he objected to many aspects of what these large enterprises had introduced into society ...
But he was not opposed in principle to large - scale production .
What he desired was to humanise such production , to socialise it so that the worker would not be the mere appendage to a machine .
Such a humanisation of large industries would result , according to Proudhon , from the introduction of strong workers ’ associations .
These associations would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day - to - day basis . ” [ 45 ]
To quote Proudhon : “ Large industry and high culture come to us by big monopoly and big property : it is necessary in the future to make them rise from the association . ” [ 46 ]
He did not ignore the economic conditions around him , including industrialisation , and noted in 1851 , of a population of 36 million , 24 million were peasants and 6 million were artisans .
The remaining 6 million included wage - workers for whom “ workmen ’s associations ” would be essential as “ a protest against the wage system , ” the “ denial of the rule of capitalists ” and for “ the management of large instruments of labour . ” [ 47 ]
Rather than seeking to turn back the clock , Proudhon was simply reflecting and incorporating the aspirations of all workers in his society – an extremely sensible position to take . [ 48 ]
This support for workers ’ self - management of production was raised in 1840 at the same time Proudhon proclaimed himself an anarchist .
As “ every industry needs ... leaders , instructors , superintendents ” they “ must be chosen from the labourers by the labourers themselves , and must fulfil the conditions of eligibility ” for “ all accumulated capital being social property , no one can be its exclusive proprietor . ” [ 49 ]
In subsequent works Proudhon expanded upon this core libertarian position of “ the complete emancipation of the workers ... the abolition of the wage worker ” [ 50 ] by self - management ( “ In democratising us , ” he argued , “ revolution has launched us on the path of industrial democracy ” [ 51 ] ) .
Co-operatives [ 52 ] ended the exploitation and oppression of wage - labour as “ every individual employed in the association ” has “ an undivided share in the property of the company , ” “ all positions are elective , and the by - laws subject to the approval of the members ” and “ the collective force , which is a product of the community , ceases to be a source of profit to a small number of managers and speculators :
It becomes the property of all the workers . ” [ 53 ]
“ Mutuality , reciprocity exists , ” Proudhon stressed , “ when all the workers in an industry , instead of working for an entrepreneur who pays them and keeps their products , work for one another and thus collaborate in the making of a common product whose profits they share amongst themselves .
Extend the principle of reciprocity as uniting the work of every group , to the Workers ’ Societies as units , and you have created a form of civilisation which from all points of view – political , economic and aesthetic – is radically different from all earlier civilisations . ”
In short : “ All associated and all free ” [ 54 ]
Thus “ the means of production should be publicly owned , production itself should be organised by workers companies . ” [ 55 ]
As Daniel Guérin summarised :
“ Proudhon and Bakunin were ‘ collectivists , ’ which is to say they declared themselves without equivocation in favour of the common exploitation , not by the State but by associated workers of the large - scale means of production and of the public services .
Proudhon has been quite wrongly presented as an exclusive enthusiast of private property . ” [ 56 ]
It is important to stress that Proudhon ’s ideas on association as part of the solution of the social question were not invented by him .
Rather , he generalised and developed what working class people were already doing . [ 57 ]
As Proudhon put it in 1848 , “ the proof ” of his mutualist ideas lay in the “ current practice , revolutionary practice ” of “ those labour associations ... which have spontaneously ... been formed in Paris and Lyon . ” [ 58 ]
These hopes were well justified as the “ evidence is strong that both worker participation in management and profit sharing tend to enhance productivity and that worker - run enterprises often are more productive than their capitalist counterparts . ” [ 59 ]
Finally , a few words on why this fundamental position of Proudhon is not better known , indeed ( at best ) ignored or ( at worse ) denied by some commentators on his ideas .
This is because state socialists like Louis Blanc advocated forms of association which Proudhon rejected as just as oppressive and exploitative as capitalism : what Proudhon termed “ the principle of Association . ”
Blanc came “ under attack by Proudhon for eliminating all competition , and for fostering state centralisation of initiative and direction at the expense of local and corporative powers and intermediate associations .
But the term association could also refer to the mutualist associations that Proudhon favoured , that is , those initiated and controlled from below . ” [ 60 ]
If Blanc advocated Association , Proudhon supported associations .
This is an important distinction lost on some .
While Proudhon ’s views of workers associations are often overlooked , the same cannot be said of his views on credit .
For some reform of credit was all he advocated !
However , for Proudhon , the socialisation and democratisation of credit was seen as one of the key means of reforming capitalism out of existence and of producing a self - employed society of artisans , farmers and co-operatives .
The People ’s Bank “ embodies the financial and economic aspects of modern democracy , that is , the sovereignty of the People , and of the republican motto , Liberty , Equality , Fraternity . ”
Like the desired workplace associations , it also had a democratic nature with a “ committee of thirty representatives ” seeing “ to the management of the Bank ” and “ chosen by the General Meeting ” made up of “ nominees of the general body of associates ” ( “ elected according to industrial categories and in proportion to the number ... there are in each category . ” ) [ 61 ]
Proudhon rightly mocked the notion that interest was a payment for abstinence [ 62 ] noting , in his exchange with the laissez - faire economist Frédéric Bastiat , that the capitalist lends “ because he has no use for it himself , being sufficiently provided with capital without it . ”
There is no sacrifice and so “ it is society 's duty to procure Gratuitous Credit for all ; that , failing to do this , it will not be a society , but a conspiracy of Capitalists against Workers , a compact for purposes of robbery and murder . ” [ 63 ]
The obvious correctness of this analysis is reflected in Keynes ’ admission that interest “ rewards no genuine sacrifice , any more than does the rent of land .
The owner of capital can obtain interest because capital is scarce , just as the owner of land can obtain rent because land is scarce .
But whilst there may be intrinsic reasons for the scarcity of land , there are no intrinsic reasons for the scarcity of capital . ” [ 64 ]
As is clear from his exchange with Bastiat , Proudhon took care to base his arguments not on abstract ideology but on the actual practices he saw around him .
He was well aware that banks issued credit and so increased the money supply in response to market demand .
As such , he was an early exponent of the endogenous theory of the money supply . [ 65 ]
His argument against metallic money was rooted in the fact that this legacy of the past ensured that interest remained as the supply of money , while dynamic due to credit creation , was ultimately limited by the available gold and silver deposits monopolised by capitalist banks .
In other words , Proudhon was pointing out that a money economy , one with an extensive banking and credit system , operates in a fundamentally different way than the barter economy assumed by most economics ( then and now ) .
He recognised that income from property violated the axiom that products exchanged for products .
As interest rates within capitalism did not reflect any real cost and credit creation by banks violated any notion that they reflected savings , these facts suggested that interest could be eliminated as it was already an arbitrary value .
The availability of cheap credit would , Proudhon hoped , lead to the end of landlordism and capitalism .
Artisans would not be crushed by interest payments and so be able to survive on the market , proletarians would be able to buy their own workplaces and peasants would be able buy their land .
To aid this process he also recommended that the state decree that all rent should be turned into part - payment for the property used and workers ’ associations run public works .
While these notions are generally dismissed as utopian , the reality is somewhat different .
As Proudhon ’s ideas were shaped by the society he lived in , one where the bulk of the working class were artisans and peasants , the notion of free credit provided by mutual banks as the means of securing working class people access to the means of production was perfectly feasible .
Today , economies world - wide manage to work without having money tied to specie .
Proudhon ’s desire “ to abolish the royalty of gold ” [ 66 ] was no mere utopian dream – capitalism itself has done so .
Perhaps this correspondence between Proudhon ’s ideas on money and modern practice is not so surprising .
Keynes ’ desire for “ the euthanasia of the rentier , and , consequently , the euthanasia of the cumulative oppressive power of the capitalist to exploit the scarcity - value of capital ” [ 67 ] has distinctly Proudhonian elements to it while he praised Proudhon ’s follower Silvio Gesell . [ 68 ]
Sadly , only the economist Dudley Dillard ’s essay “ Keynes and Proudhon ” [ 69 ] addresses any overlap between the two thinkers and even this is incomplete ( it fails to discuss Proudhon ’s ideas on co-operatives and falsely suggests that his critique of capitalism was limited to finance capital [ 70 ] ) .
Another area of overlap was their shared concern over reducing uncertainty in the market and stabilising the economy ( by the state , in the case of Keynes , by mutualist associations for Proudhon ) .
Both , needless to say , under - estimated the power of rentier interests as well as their willingness to wither away …
This abolition of gold - backed money has not lead to the other reforms Proudhon had hoped for .
This is unsurprising , as this policy has been implemented to keep capitalism going and not as a wider reform strategy as expounded by the Frenchman . [ 71 ]
So while the banks may issue credit and central banks accommodate it with non-specie money , they are still capitalist enterprises working within a capitalist environment – they have not been turned into a People ’s Bank .
Interest was not abolished nor was there a social movement , as in the 19th century , aiming to create workers ’ associations .
Nationalisation , not socialisation , was the preferred social reform of the post - World War II years .
The notion that a mutual bank should fund investment is also hardly utopian .
The stock market is not the means by which capital is actually raised within capitalism and is largely of symbolic value ( the overwhelming bulk of transactions are in shares of existing firms ) .
Small and medium sized firms are hardly inefficient because they lack equity shares .
Moreover , there is good reason to think that the stock market hinders economic efficiency by generating a perverse set of incentives and “ the signals emitted by the stock market are either irrelevant or harmful to real economic activity . ”
As “ the stock market itself counts little or nothing as a source of finance , ” shareholders “ have no useful role . ”
Moreover , if the experience of capitalism is anything to go by , mutual banks will also reduce the business cycle for those countries in which banks provide more outside finance than markets have “ greater growth in and stability of investment over time than the market - centred ones . ” [ 72 ]
All of which confirms Proudhon ’s arguments for mutual credit and attacks on rentiers .
There is no need for capital markets in a system based on mutual banks and networks of co-operatives .
New investments would be financed partly from internal funds ( i.e. , retained income ) and partly from external loans from mutual banks .
The standard argument against mutual credit is that it would simply generate inflation .
This misunderstands the nature of money and inflation in a capitalist economy .
The notion that inflation is caused simply by there being too much money chasing too few goods and that the state simply needs to stop printing money to control it was proven completely false by the Monetarist experiments of Thatcher and Reagan .
Not only could the state not control the money supply , changes in it were not reflected in subsequent changes in inflation . [ 73 ]
In a real capitalist economy credit is offered based on an analysis of whether the bank thinks it will get it back . [ 74 ]
In a mutualist economy , credit will likewise be extended to those whom the bank thinks will increase the amount of goods and services available . [ 75 ]
The People ’s Bank would not just print money and hand it out in the streets , [ 76 ] it would ration credit and aim to fund investment in the real economy .
This would create money and lead to debt but it adds to the goods and services in the economy as well as the capacity to service that debt .
Moreover , the reduction of interest to zero would ensure more people repaid their loans as servicing debt would be easier . [ 77 ]
Finally , John Ehrenberg ’s assertion that 1848 saw a “ subtle and important shift ” in Proudhon ’s ideas is simply untenable .
He asserts that whereas Proudhon “ formerly placed primary importance on the organisation of work , he was now thinking of the organisation of credit and exchange ; where he had previously made an attempt to articulate the needs of the proletariat , he was now demanding help for the petty bourgeois . ” [ 78 ]
Yet “ the organisation of credit ” in Proudhon ’s eyes did not exclude “ the organisation of labour . ”
If anything , Proudhon ’s arguments for workers associations and against wage - labour became more , not less , pronounced !
Proudhon started to discuss “ the organisation of credit ” more because it reflected a shift from goals to means , from critique to practical attempts to solve the social question in the revolution of 1848 .
Proudhon ’s letter to Louis Blanc in April 1848 suggested that “ the Exchange Bank is the organisation of labour ’s greatest asset ” and allowed “ the new form of society to be defined and created among the workers . ” [ 79 ]
Another , written two days later , reiterated this point : “ To organise credit and circulation is to increase production , to determine the new shapes of industrial society . ” [ 80 ]
His second election manifesto of 1848 argued that workers “ have organised credit among themselves ” and “ labour associations ” have grasped “ spontaneously ” that the “ organisation of credit and organisation of labour amount to one and the same . ”
By organising both , the workers “ would soon have wrested alienated capital back again , through their organisation and competition . ” [ 81 ]
This was reiterated in a letter to socialist Pierre Leroux in December 1849 , with credit being seen as the means to form workers ’ associations . [ 82 ]
Moreover , the necessity to differentiate his ideas from other socialists who advocated “ the organisation of labour ” ( such as Louis Blanc ) must also have played its part in Proudhon ’s use of “ the organisation of credit . ”
Given his opposition to centralised state - based systems of labour organisation it made little sense to use the same expression to describe his vision of a self - managed and decentralised socialism .
Proudhon subjected the state to withering criticism .
For some , this has become the defining aspect of his theories ( not to mention anarchism in general ) .
This false .
This opposition to the state flowed naturally from the critique of property and so anarchist anti-statism cannot be abstracted from its anti-capitalism .
While recognising that the state and its bureaucracy had exploitative and oppressive interests of its own , he analysed its role as an instrument of class rule :
“ In a society based on the principle of inequality of conditions , government , whatever it is , feudal , theocratic , bourgeois , imperial , is reduced , in last analysis , to a system of insurance for the class which exploits and owns against that which is exploited and owns nothing . ” [ 83 ]
He repeatedly pointed to its function of “ protecting the nobility and upper class against the lower classes . ” [ 84 ]
This analysis was consistent throughout his political career .
In 1846 he had argued that the state “ finds itself inevitably enchained to capital and directed against the proletariat . ” [ 85 ]
So what was the state ?
For Proudhon , the state was a body above society , it was “ the EXTERNAL constitution of the social power ” by which the people delegate “ its power and sovereignty ” and so “ does not govern itself ; now one individual , now several , by a title either elective or hereditary , are charged with governing it , with managing its affairs , with negotiating and compromising in its name . ”
Anarchists “ deny government and the State , because we affirm that which the founders of States have never believed in , the personality and autonomy of the masses . ”
Ultimately , “ the only way to organise democratic government is to abolish government . ” [ 86 ]
His attacks on “ Direct Legislation ” and “ Direct Government ” in General Idea of the Revolution refer to using elections and referenda in a centralised state on a national scale rather than decentralised communal self - government .
For Proudhon democracy could not be limited to a nation as one unit periodically picking its rulers ( “ nothing resembles a monarchy more than a république unitaire ” [ 87 ] ) .
Its real meaning was much deeper : “ politicians , whatever their colours , are insurmountably repelled by anarchy which they construe as disorder : as if democracy could be achieved other than by distribution of authority and as if the true meaning of the word ‘ democracy ’ was not dismissal of government . ” [ 88 ]
Given this analysis , it becomes unsurprising that Proudhon did not seek political power to reform society .
This was confirmed when , for a period , he was elected to the National Assembly in 1848 : “ As soon as I set foot in the parliamentary Sinai , I ceased to be in touch with the masses ; because I was absorbed by my legislative work , I entirely lost sight of the current events ...
One must have lived in that isolator which is called a National Assembly to realise how the men who are most completely ignorant of the state of the country are almost always those who represent it . ”
There was “ ignorance of daily facts ” and “ fear of the people ” ( “ the sickness of all those who belong to authority ” ) for “ the people , for those in power , are the enemy . ” [ 89 ]
Real change must come from “ outside the sphere of parliamentarism , as sterile as it is absorbing . ” [ 90 ]
Unsurprisingly , then , the “ social revolution is seriously compromised if it comes through a political revolution ” [ 91 ] and “ to be in politics was to wash one ’s hands in shit . ” [ 92 ]
Thus , rather than having some idealistic opposition to the state , [ 93 ]
Proudhon viewed it as an instrument of class rule which could not be captured for social reform .
As David Berry suggests , “ repeated evidence of the willingness of supposedly progressive republican bourgeoisie to resort to violent repression of the working classes had led Proudhon , like many of his class and generation , to lose faith in politics and the state and to put the emphasis on working - class autonomy and on the question of socio-economic organisation .
For Proudhon and the mutualists , the lessons of the workers ’ uprising of 1830 and 1848 were that the powers of the state were merely another aspect of the powers of capital , and both were to be resisted equally strongly . ” [ 94 ]
Like other libertarians , Proudhon was extremely critical of state socialist schemes which he opposed just as much as he did capitalism :
“ The entire animus of his opposition to what he termed ‘ community ’ was to avoid the central ownership of property and the central control of economic and social decision - making . ” [ 95 ]
He particularly attacked the ideas of Jacobin socialist Louis Blanc whose Organisation of Work argued that social ills resulted from competition and they could be solved by eliminating it .
“ The Government ” , argued Blanc , “ should be regarded as the supreme director of production , and invested with great strength to accomplish its task . ”
The government would “ raise a loan ” to create social workplaces , “ provide ” them “ with Statues ” which “ would have the force and form of laws ” and “ regulate the hierarchy of workers ” ( after the first year “ the hierarchy would be appointed on the elective principle ” by the workers in the associations ) .
Capitalists would “ receive interest for their capital ” while workers would keep the remaining income .
They would “ destroy competition ” by “ availing itself of competition ” as their higher efficiency would force capitalist firms to become social workplaces . [ 96 ]
Proudhon objected to this scheme on many levels .
Blanc appealed “ to the state for its silent partnership ; that is , he gets down on his knees before the capitalists and recognises the sovereignty of monopoly . ”
As it was run by the state , the system of workshops would hardly be libertarian as “ hierarchy would result from the elective principle ... as in constitutional politics ...
Who will make the law ?
The government . ” [ 97 ]
This was because of the perspective of state socialists :
“ As you cannot conceive of society without hierarchy , you have made yourselves the apostles of authority ; worshippers of power , you think only of strengthening it and muzzling liberty ; your favourite maxim is that the welfare of the people must be achieved in spite of the people ; instead of proceeding to social reform by the extermination of power and politics , you insist on a reconstruction of power and politics . ” [ 98 ]
Proudhon questioned whether any regime based on “ from each according to their abilities , to each according to their needs ” could avoid conflict due to individuals and society disagreeing over what these were .
This would result in either oppression ( “ What difference is there then between fraternity and the wage system ? ” ) or the society ’s “ end from lack of associates . ” [ 99 ]
He was also doubtful that state monopolies could efficiently allocate resources .
[ 100 ]
Ultimately , the problem was that reform by means of the state violated basic socialist principles :
“ M. Blanc is never tired of appealing to authority , and socialism loudly declares itself anarchistic ; M. Blanc places power above society , and socialism tends to subordinate it to society ; M. Blanc makes social life descend from above , and socialism maintains that it springs up and grows from below ; M. Blanc runs after politics , and socialism is in quest of science .
No more hypocrisy , let me say to M. Blanc : you desire neither Catholicism nor monarchy nor nobility , but you must have a God , a religion , a dictatorship , a censorship , a hierarchy , distinctions , and ranks .
For my part , I deny your God , your authority , your sovereignty , your judicial State , and all your representative mystifications . ” [ 101 ]
Proudhon continually stressed that state control of the means of production was a danger to the liberty of the worker and simply the continuation of capitalism with the state as the new boss .
He rejected the call of “ certain utopians ” that “ the Government seize trade , industry and agriculture , to add them to its attributes and to make the French nation a nation of wage - workers . ” [ 102 ]
Nationalisation would simply be “ more wage slavery . ” [ 103 ]
The net result of state socialism would be “ a compact democracy , seemingly rooted in dictatorship of the masses , but wherein the masses merely have the opportunity to consolidate universal slavery in accordance with formulas and guide - lines borrowed from the former absolutism ” : “ Indivisibility of power ” ; “ Voracious centralisation ” ; “ Systematic demolition of all individual , corporative and local thought , these being deemed sources of discord ” ; and “ Inquisitorial policing . ” [ 104 ]
Proudhon ’s fears on the inefficiency of state socialism and that it would be little more than state capitalist tyranny became all too real under Leninism .
His prediction that reformist socialism would simply postpone the abolition of exploitation indefinitely while paying capitalists interest and dividends was also proven all too correct ( as can be seen with the British Labour Party ’s post - war nationalisations ) .
Proudhon ’s polemics against state socialists have often been taken to suggest that he considered his mutualism as non-socialist ( this is often generalised into anarchism as well , with a contrast often being made between it and the wider socialist movement ) .
Occasionally ( most notably in System of Economic Contradictions )
Proudhon used the term “ socialism ” to solely describe the state socialist schemes he opposed .
[ 105 ]
Usually , however , he described himself as a socialist [ 106 ] and publicly embraced the Red Flag at the start of the 1848 revolution , [ 107 ] considering it “ the federal standard of humanity , the symbol of universal fraternity ” signifying the “ Abolition of the proletariat and of servitude ” and “ Equality of political rights : universal suffrage . ” [ 108 ]
Socialism , for Proudhon , was “ the final term , the complete expression of the Republic . ” [ 109 ]
So although he criticised both centralised democracy and state socialism , he still considered himself a democrat and socialist : “ We are also democracy and socialism ; we may at times laugh at both the names and the personnel , but what those words cover and what those people stand for belong to us also ; we must be careful of them ! ” [ 110 ]
Proudhon stated the obvious : “ Modern Socialism was not founded as a sect or church ; it has seen a number of different schools . ” [ 111 ]
Like Bakunin and Kropotkin , he argued against state socialism and called for a decentralised , self - managed , federal , bottom - up socialism : anarchism .
While Proudhon repeatedly called himself a revolutionary and urged a “ revolution from below ” , he also rejected violence and insurrection .
While later anarchists like Bakunin and Kropotkin embraced the class struggle , including strikes , unions and revolts , Proudhon opposed such means and preferred peaceful reform : “ through Political Economy we must turn the theory of Property against Property in such a way as to create ... liberty . ” [ 112 ]
Unsurprisingly , as he considered the state as being dominated by capital , the “ problem before the labouring classes ... consists not in capturing , but in subduing both power and monopoly , – that is , in generating from the bowels of the people , from the depths of labour , a greater authority , a more potent fact , which shall envelop capital and the state and subjugate them . ”
For , “ to combat and reduce power , to put it in its proper place in society , it is of no use to change the holders of power or introduce some variation into its workings : an agricultural and industrial combination must be found by means of which power , today the ruler of society , shall become its slave . ” [ 113 ]
The 1848 revolution gave Proudhon the chance to implement this strategy .
On May 4th he “ propose [d ] that a provisional committee be set up to orchestrate exchange , credit and commerce amongst the workers ” and this would “ liaise with similar committees ” elsewhere in France .
This would be “ a body representative of the proletariat ... , a state within the state , in opposition to the bourgeois representatives . ”
He urged that “ a new society be founded in the centre of the old society ” by the working class for “ the government can do nothing for you .
But you can do everything for yourselves ” [ 114 ]
Proudhon also pointed to the clubs , directly democratic neighbourhood associations grouped around political tendencies , seeing them “ as the beginning for a true popular democracy , sensitive to the needs of the people . ” [ 115 ]
As Peter Henry Aman describes it , a “ newspaper close to the club movement , Proudhon ’s Le Représentant du Peuple , suggested a division of labour between clubs and National Assembly ...
By shedding light on social questions , the daily club discussions would prepare the National Assembly ’s legislative debates as ‘ the indispensable corollary . ’
This flattering vision of a dual power , with clubs representing ‘ the poorest and most numerous parts of the population , ’ apparently proved seductive . ” [ 116 ]
In 1849 Proudhon argued that clubs “ had to be organised .
The organisation of popular societies was the fulcrum of democracy , the corner - stone of the republican order . ”
These were “ the one institution that democratic authorities should have respected , and not just respected but also fostered and organised . ” [ 117 ]
As Daniel Guérin summarised , “ in the midst of the 1848 Revolution ” , Proudhon “ sketched out a minimum libertarian program : progressive reduction in the power of the State , parallel development of the power of the people from below , through what he called clubs ” which today we “ would call councils . ” [ 118 ]
These organisations would be the means of exercising popular pressure and influence onto the state to force it into implementing appropriate reforms for government “ can only turn into something and do the work of the revolution insofar as it will be so invited , provoked or compelled by some power outside of itself that seizes the initiative and sets things rolling . ” [ 119 ]
This would be combined with the creation of organisations for mutual credit and production in order to create the framework by which capitalism and the state would disappear .
Proudhon “ believed fervently ... in the salvation of working men , by their own efforts , through economic and social action alone ” and “ advocated , and to a considerable extent inspired , the undercutting of this terrain [ of the state ] from without by means of autonomous working - class associations . ” [ 120 ]
He hoped that the “ proletariat , gradually dejacobinised ” would seek “ its share not only of direct suffrage in the affairs of society but of direct action . ” [ 121 ]
Over a decade later Proudhon noted that in 1848 he had “ called upon the state to intervene in establishing ” various “ major public utilities ” but “ once the state had completed its task of creation ” then these should not be left in its hands . [ 122 ]
Rather than “ fatten certain contractors , ” the state should create “ a new kind of property ” by “ granting the privilege of running ” public utilities “ to responsible companies , not of capitalists , but of workmen . ”
Municipalities and their federations would take the initiative in setting up public works but actual control would rest with workers ’ co-operatives for “ it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies , with equal conditions for all members , on pain of a relapse into feudalism . ” [ 123 ]
As he summarised in his notebooks :
“ the abolition of the State is the last term of a series , which consists of an incessant diminution , by political and administrative simplification the number of public functionaries and to put into the care of responsible workers societies the works and services confided to the state . ” [ 124 ]
Thus “ the most decisive result of the Revolution is , after having organised labour and property , to do away with political centralisation , in a word , with the State . ” [ 125 ]
This may , for some , appear as a contradiction in Proudhon ’s ideas for , as an anarchist , he was against the state .
This would be a superficial analysis as it confuses short - term reforms and long - term social transformation .
Moreover , anarchism is not purely anti-state .
It is also anti-capitalist and so advocating capitalist banking or the privatisation of utilities and industries would be anti-anarchist .
Proudhon was not advocating nationalisation ( or state socialism ) .
He simply considered limited state action to create the correct environment to allow co-operatives to flourish and to run public services and utilities as being more consistent with libertarian goals than supporting wage - labour by turning more parts of the economy over to the capitalist class .
In the grim days of the Second Empire , when the hopes and self - activity of 1848 appeared to be crushed , Proudhon suggested encouraging investors to fund co-operatives rather than capitalist companies , seeking to encourage the industrial democracy he wished to replace the industrial feudalism of capitalism by means of the institutions of capitalism itself .
In return for funds , the capitalists would receive dividends until such time as the initial loan was repaid and then the company would revert into a proper co-operative ( i.e. , one owned as well as operated by its workers ) .
[ 126 ]
So the optimism produced by February revolution that drove his more obviously anarchist works that climaxed in 1851 ’s General Idea of the Revolution gave way more cautious reforms .
Significantly , in the 1860s , “ Proudhon ’s renewed interest in socialism was precipitated ... by the renewed activity of workers themselves . ” [ 127 ]
So , in general , Proudhon placed his hopes for introducing socialism in alternative institutions created by working class people themselves and “ insisted that the revolution could only come from below , through the action of the workers themselves . ” [ 128 ]
Joining the government to achieve that goal was , for Proudhon , contradictory and unlikely to work .
The state was a centralised , top - down structure and so unable to take into account the real needs of society :
“ experience testifies and philosophy demonstrates ... that any revolution , to be effective , must be spontaneous and emanate , not from the heads of the authorities but from the bowels of the people : that government is reactionary rather than revolutionary : that it could not have any expertise in revolutions , given that society , to which that secret is alone revealed , does not show itself through legislative decree but rather through the spontaneity of its manifestations : that , ultimately , the only connection between government and labour is that labour , in organising itself , has the abrogation of government as its mission . ” [ 129 ]
This suggested a bottom - up approach , socialism from below rather than a socialism imposed by the state :
“ The Revolution from above is the intervention of power in everything ; it is the absolutist initiative of the State , the pure governmentalism of ...
Louis Blanc .
The Revolution from above is the negation of collective activity , of popular spontaneity ...
What serious and lasting Revolution was not made from below , by the people ?
How did the Revolution of 1789 come about ?
How was that of February made ?
The Revolution from above has never been other than the oppression of the wills of those below . ” [ 130 ]
Ultimately : “ No authority is compatible with the principle of mutuality , but no authority can help bring about reform .
For all authority is antithetical to equality and justice . ” [ 131 ]
Proudhon ’s overarching perspective was to avoid violence and so as well as encouraging working class self - activity he also sought to persuade the capitalist class that social reform , as well as benefiting the working class , would also benefit them in terms of a general improved standard of living and freedom and so they had no reason to oppose it . [ 132 ]
The bourgeoisie were not convinced and after the experience of the Second Republic his calls upon them ceased .
Instead , he completely directed his hopes for reform towards the activities of working class people themselves , in their ability to act for themselves and build just and free associations and federations .
This perspective was hardly new , though .
As he put it in 1842 ’s Warning to Proprietors :
“ Workers , labourers , men of the people , whoever you may be , the initiative of reform is yours .
It is you who will accomplish that synthesis of social composition which will be the masterpiece of creation , and you alone can accomplish it . ” [ 133 ]
For “ revolutionary power ... is no longer in the government or the National Assembly , it is in you .
Only the people , acting directly , without intermediaries , can bring about the economic revolution . ” [ 134 ]
It was Proudhon “ who first drew to the attention of the wider public of Europe the fact that socialism would henceforward become identified , not with the plans of utopian dreamers , but with the concrete and daily struggles of the working class . ” [ 135 ]
It is this vision which was taken up and expanded upon by subsequent generations of libertarians .
As he refused to suggest that socialists should take state power themselves but , instead , organise outside political structures to create a socialist society Proudhon ’s various schemes of social change , while reformist , were ultimately anarchistic in nature .
This became clear in his final work , The Political Capacity of the Working Classes , where he advocated a radical separation of the working class from bourgeois institutions , urging that they should organise themselves autonomously and reject all participation in bourgeois politics . [ 136 ]
Such an alliance between the proletariat , artisans and peasantry ( the plural working classes of the title [ 137 ] ) would replace the bourgeois regime with a mutualist one as the workers became increasingly conscious of themselves as a class and of their growing political capacity .
This perspective “ is nothing less than the dispute which would later split Marxists from anarchists , and ... socialists from syndicalists . ” [ 138 ]
In place of capitalism and the state , Proudhon suggested a socio- economic federal system , a decentralised federation of self - managed associations . [ 139 ]
This federation ’s delegates would be mandated and subject to recall by their electors : “ we can follow [ our deputies ] step by step in their legislative acts and their votes ; we shall make them transmit our arguments and our documents ; we shall indicate our will to them , and when we are discontented , we will revoke them ... the mandatory instruction [ mandat imperatif ] , permanent revocability , are the most immediate , undeniable , consequences of the electoral principle .
It is the inevitable program of all democracy . ” [ 140 ]
Moreover , the “ legislative power is not distinguished from the executive power . ” [ 141 ]
This system would be based on free association and would reject the “ unity that tends to absorb the sovereignty of the villages , cantons , and provinces , into a central authority .
Leave to each its sentiments , its affections , its beliefs , its languages and its customs ”
“ The first effect of centralisation , ” Proudhon stressed , “ is to bring about the disappearance , in the diverse localities of the country , of all types of indigenous character ; while one imagines that by this means to exalt the political life among the masses , one in fact destroys it ...
The fusion that is to say the annihilation , of particular nationalities where citizens live and distinguish themselves , into an abstract nationality where one can neither breathe nor recognise oneself : there is unity . ” [ 142 ]
He based his federalism on functional groups , in both society and economy .
As his discussion of “ collective force ” in “ Petit Catéchisme Politique ” shows , [ 143 ]
Proudhon was no individualist .
He was well aware that groups were greater than the sum of their parts and viewed federalism as the best means of allowing this potential to be generated and expressed .
Only that could ensure a meaningful democracy ( what anarchists call self - management ) rather than the current system of centralised , statist , democracy in which people elect their rulers every 4 years .
Thus “ universal suffrage provides us , … in an embryonic state , with the complete system of future society .
If it is reduced to the people nominating a few hundred deputies who have no initiative ... social sovereignty becomes a mere fiction and the Revolution is strangled at birth . ” [ 144 ]
By contrast , his mutualist society was fundamentally democratic :
“ We have , then , not an abstract sovereignty of the people , as in the Constitution of 1793 and subsequent constitutions , or as in Rousseau ’s Social Contract , but an effective sovereignty of the working , reigning , governing masses ... how could it be otherwise if they are in charge of the whole economic system including labour , capital , credit , property and wealth ? ” [ 145 ]
Initially , Proudhon focused on economic federalism .
In his Programme révolutionnaire of early 1848 he “ had spoken of organising society into democratically controlled groups of workers and professionals .
These would form a congress which would determine how to deal with those issues of a national scope beyond the competency of any one category . ” [ 146 ]
However , three years later , in General Idea of the Revolution , he placed communes at the heart of his agricultural reforms as well as for public works .
After 1852 he became more explicit , adding a geographical federalism to economic federalism .
The two cannot be considered in isolation :
“ Proudhon placed socioeconomic relations on as high a level ( or higher ) than political ones .
Proudhon ’s ... federalism ... was to apply to all public dimensions of society .
A just society required the autonomy of workshops and of communes : advancement on one level alone had little chance of success .
Without political federalism , he warned , economic federalism would be politically impotent ...
Workers ’ associations would be ineffective in a political environment which encouraged meddling by the central administration .
Conversely , without economic mutualism , political federalism would remain impotent and precarious ... and would degenerate back into centralism .
In short , it was necessary that federalism be both professional and regional , both social and political . ” [ 147 ]
There were three alternatives : capitalism ( “ monopoly and what follows ” ) , state socialism ( “ exploitation by the State ” ) or “ a solution based on equality , – in other words , the organisation of labour , which involves the negation of political economy and the end of property . ” [ 148 ]
Rejecting the first two , Proudhon favoured socialisation , [ 149 ] genuine common - ownership and free access of the means of production and land .
[ 150 ]
The “ land is indispensable to our existence , consequently a common thing , consequently insusceptible of appropriation ” and “ all capital , whether material or mental , being the result of collective labour , is , in consequence , collective property ” [ 151 ]
Self - managed workers ’ associations would run industry .
In short :
“ Under the law of association , transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour , so cannot become a cause of inequality ...
We are socialists ... under universal association , ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour is social ownership ...
We want the mines , canals , railways handed over to democratically organised workers ’ associations ...
We want these associations to be models for agriculture , industry and trade , the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies , joined together in the common bond of the democratic and social Republic . ” [ 152 ]
Against property , Proudhon argued for possession .
This meant free access to the resources required to live and the inability to bar access to resources you claimed to own but did not use .
Those who used a resource ( land , tools , dwelling , workplace ) should control both it and the product of their labour .
Such possession allowed people to live and prosper and was the cornerstone of liberty .
Whether on the land or in industry , Proudhon ’s aim was to create a society of “ possessors without masters . ” [ 153 ]
Only self - governing producers associations could be the basis for a society in which concentration of political , economic and social power can be avoided and individual freedom protected : “ Because the right to live and to develop oneself fully is equal for all , inequality of conditions is an obstacle to the exercise of this right . ” [ 154 ]
So “ political right had to be buttressed by economic right ” for if society became “ divided into two classes , one of landlords , capitalists , and entrepreneurs , the other of wage - earning proletarians ” then “ the political order will still be unstable . ”
To avoid this outcome an “ agro- industrial federation ” was required which would “ provide reciprocal security in commerce and industry ” and “ protect the citizens ... from capitalist and financial exploitation . ”
In this way , the agro- industrial federation “ will tend to foster increasing equality ... through mutualism in credit and insurance ... guaranteeing the right to work and to education , and an organisation of work which allows each labourer to become a skilled worker and an artist , each wage - earner to become his own master . ”
Mutualism recognises that “ industries are sisters ” and so “ should therefore federate , not in order to be absorbed and confused together , but in order to guarantee mutually the conditions of common prosperity , upon which no one has exclusive claim . ” [ 155 ]
The empirical evidence for economic federalism is supportive of it .
In negative terms , it is clear that isolated co-operatives dependent on funding from capitalist banks find it hard to survive and grow .
In positive terms , it is no co-incidence that the Mondragon co-operative complex in the Basque region of Spain has a credit union and mutual support networks between its co-operatives and is by far the most successful co-operative system in the world .
Other successful clusters of co-operation within capitalism also have support networks . [ 156 ]
Clear evidence for Proudhon ’s argument that all industries are related and need to support each other .
Proudhon was an early advocate of what is now termed market socialism – an economy of competing co-operatives and self - employed workers .
Some incorrectly argue that market socialism is not socialist . [ 157 ]
Donny Gluckstein , for instance , suggests with casual abandon that Proudhon ’s ideas are “ easily recognisable as the precursor of neo- liberal economics today ” but “ were located in a different context and so took a far more radical form when adopted by the male artisan class . ” [ 158 ]
Such claims are premised on a basic misunderstanding , namely that markets equate to capitalism .
Yet this hides the key defining feature of capitalism : wage - labour . [ 159 ]
Thus capitalism is uniquely marked by wage - labour , not markets ( which pre-date it by centuries ) and so it is possible to support markets while being a socialist .
In a mutualist society , based on workers ’ self - management and socialisation , wage - labour would not exist .
Rather workers would be seeking out democratic associations to join and , once a member , have the same rights and duties as others within it . [ 160 ]
In short , as K. Steven Vincent argues , “ Proudhon consistently advanced a program of industrial democracy which would return control and direction of the economy to the workers .
And he envisaged such a socialist program to be possible only within the framework of a society which encouraged just social relationships and which structured itself on federal lines . ” [ 161 ]
It is also fair to ponder when has an advocate of neo-liberal economics ever argued that the idol of laissez - faire capitalism , the law of supply and demand , was a “ deceitful law ... suitable only for assuring the victory of the strong over the weak , of those who own property over those who own nothing ” ? [ 162 ]
Or denounced capitalist firms because they result in the worker being “ subordinated , exploited : his permanent condition is one of obedience ” and so people are related as “ subordinates and superiors ” with “ two ... castes of masters and wage - workers , which is repugnant to a free and democratic society ” and urged co-operatives to replace them ? [ 163 ]
Or suggested that we “ shall never have real workingmen ’s associations until the government learns that public services should neither be operated by itself or handed over to private stock companies ; but should be leased on contract to organised and responsible companies of workers ” ? [ 164 ]
Nor would an ideologue of laissez - faire capitalism be happy with an agro-industrial federation nor would they advocate regulation of markets :
“ The advocates of mutualism are as familiar as anyone with the laws of supply and demand and they will be careful not to infringe them .
Detailed and frequently reviewed statistics , precise information about needs and living standards , an honest breakdown of cost prices ... the fixing after amicable discussion of a maximum and minimum profit margin , taking into account the risks involved , the organising of regulating societies ; these things , roughly speaking , constitute all the measures by which they hope to regulate the market . ” [ 165 ]
Finally , what neo-liberal would proclaim : “ What is the capitalist ?
Everything !
What should he be ?
Nothing ! ” ?[ 166 ]
Or that “ I belong to the Party of Work against the party of Capital ” ? [ 167 ]
In fact , Proudhon had nothing but contempt for the neo-liberals of his time and they for him . [ 168 ]
He recognised the class basis of mainstream economic ideology : “ Political economy , as taught by MM .
Say , Rossi , Blanqui , Wolovski , Chevalier , etc. , is only the economy of the property - owners , and its application to society inevitably and organically gives birth to misery . ” [ 169 ]
In short : “ The enemies of society are Economists . ” [ 170 ]
Claims that Proudhon was a propertarian or a supporter of neo-liberalism simply misunderstand both capitalism and Proudhon ’s ideas .
Unsurprisingly , then , Bakunin wrote of Proudhon ’s “ socialism , based on individual and collective liberty and upon the spontaneous action of free associations . ” [ 171 ]
Proudhon is placed firmly into the socialist tradition due to his support for workers associations and his belief that “ socialism is ... the elimination of misery , the abolition of capitalism and of wage - labour , the transformation of property , the decentralisation of government , the organisation of universal suffrage , the effective and direct sovereignty of the workers , the equilibrium of economic forces , the substitution of the contractual regime for the legal regime , etc . ” [ 172 ]
In opposition to various schemes of state socialism and communism , Proudhon argued for a decentralised and federal market socialism based on workers ’ self - management of production and community self - government .
As would be expected of the leading French socialist of his time , Proudhon ’s impact continued long after his death in 1865 .
Most immediately was the growth of the International Working Men ’s Association founded by his followers and the application of many of his ideas by the Paris Commune . [ 173 ]
His most important contribution to politics was laying the foundations for all the subsequent schools of anarchism .
Another key legacy is his consistent vision of socialism as being rooted in workers ’ self - management .
Dorothy W. Douglas correctly notes that “ the co-operative movement ... syndicalism ... guild socialism ... all bear traces of the kind of self - governing industrial life to which Proudhon looked forward . ” [ 174 ]
This vision was expressed within the First International by both the mutualists and the collectivists around Bakunin .
While later eclipsed by schemes of nationalisation , the bankruptcy of such “ state capitalism ” ( to use Kropotkin ’s term ) has re-enforced the validity of Proudhon ’s arguments .
Indeed , as Daniel Guérin suggested , when Marxists advocate self - management they “ have been reverting ... unwittingly and in an unspoken way to the Proudhon school ” for “ anarchism , ever since Proudhon , has acted as the advocate of ... self - management . ” [ 175 ]
No other socialist thinker of his time so consistently advocated workers ’ self - management of production or placed it at the core of his socialism .
This is not to say that Proudhon was without flaws , for he had many .
He was not consistently libertarian in his ideas , tactics and language .
His personal bigotries are disgusting and few modern anarchists would tolerate them . [ 176 ]
He made some bad decisions and occasionally ranted in his private notebooks ( where the worst of his anti-Semitism was expressed ) .
We could go on but to concentrate on these aspects of Proudhon ’s thought would be to paint a selective , and so false , picture of his ideas and influence .
Anarchists seek Proudhon ’s legacy in those aspects of his ideas that are consistent with the goal of human liberation , not those when he did not rise to the ideals he so eloquently advocated .
This is what we discuss here , the positive impact of a lifetime fighting for justice , equality and liberty .
The International Workingmen ’s Association ( IWMA ) is usually associated with Marx .
In fact , it was created by British trade unionists and “ French mutualist workingmen , who in turn were direct followers of Pierre - Joseph Proudhon ” ( “ Contrary to stubborn legend , Karl Marx was not one of its actual founders ” ) .
[ 177 ]
The negotiations that lead to its founding began in 1862 when the mutualists ( including Henri- Louis Tolain and Eugene Varlin [ 178 ] ) visited the London International Exhibition . [ 179 ]
Like Proudhon , his followers in the IWMA thought workers “ should be striving for the abolition of salaried labour and capitalist enterprise ” by means of co-operatives for the “ manager / employer ( patron ) was a superfluous element in the production process who was able to deny the worker just compensation for his labour merely by possessing the capital that paid for the workshop , tools , and materials . ” [ 180 ]
The French Internationalists were “ strongly hostile to centralisation .
They were federalists , intent on building up working - class organisations on a local basis and then federating the local federations .
The free France they looked forward to was to be a country made up of locally autonomous communes , freely federated for common purposes which required action over larger areas ...
In this sense they were Anarchists . ” [ 181 ]
Thus in 1866 the International officially adopted the Red Flag as its symbol , confirming Proudhon ’s declaration that “ the red flag represents the final revolution ...
The red flag is the federal standard of humanity ! ” [ 182 ]
Given their role in setting up the International , the mutualists dominated the agenda in its first years .
According to the standard , usually Marxist or Marxist - influenced , accounts of the International this initial domination by the mutualists was eclipsed by the rise of a collectivist current ( usually identified with Marxism ) .
This is not entirely true .
Yes , the Basel Congress of 1869 saw the success of a collectivist motion which was opposed by Tolain and some of his fellow French Internationalists , but this was a debate on the specific issue of agricultural collectivisation rather than a rejection of mutualism as such :
“ The endorsement of collectivism by the International at the Basel Congress might appear to be a rejection of the French position on co-operatives .
Actually , it was not , for collectivism as it was defined by its proponents meant simply the end of private ownership of agricultural land .
Lumped together with this was usually the demand for common ownership of mines and railways . ” [ 183 ]
Thus it was “ not a debate over co-operative production in favour of some other model ” but rather concerned its extension to agriculture .
At the Geneva Congress of 1866 the French mutualists “ persuaded the Congress to agree by unanimous vote that there was a higher goal – the suppression of ‘ salaried status ’ – which ... could be done only through co-operatives . ”
At the Lausanne Congress of 1867 , the mutualists around Tolain “ acknowledged the necessity of public ownership of canals , roads , and mines ” and there was “ unanimous accord ” on public ownership of “ the means of transportation and exchange of goods . ”
This was Proudhon ’s position as well .
The proponents of collectivisation at the Lausanne Congress wanted to “ extend Tolain ’s ideas to all property . ” [ 184 ]
While the resolution on collectivisation “ represents the final decisive defeat of the strict Proudhonist element which , centred in Paris , had dominated in France and had drawn the parameters of the debates at the International ’s congresses in the beginning , ” [ 185 ] this did not automatically mean the end of Proudhonian influences in the International .
After all , the main leader of the “ collectivist ” position was César De Paepe , a self - proclaimed Mutualist and follower of Proudhon .
As such , the debate was fundamentally one between followers of Proudhon , not between mutualists and Marxists , and the 1869 resolution was consistent with Proudhon ’s ideas .
This can be seen from the fact that resolution itself was remarkably Proudhonian in nature , with it urging the collectivisation of roads , canals , railways , mines , quarries , collieries and forests , and these to be “ ceded to ‘ workers ’ companies ’ which would guarantee the ‘ mutual rights ’ of workers and would sell their goods or services at cost .
”
The land would “ be turned over to ‘ agricultural companies ’ ( i.e. , agricultural workers ) with the same guarantees as those required of the ‘ workers ’ companies ’ ” [ 186 ]
De Paepe himself clarified the issue : “ Collective property would belong to society as a whole , but would be conceded to associations of workers .
The State would be no more than a federation of various groups of workers . ” [ 187 ]
Given that Proudhon had advocated workers ’ companies to run publically owned industries as well as arguing the land was common property and be transferred to communes , the resolution was not the rejection of Proudhon ’s ideas that many assume .
In fact , it can be considered a logical fusion of his arguments on land ownership and workers ’ associations .
As Daniel Guérin notes , “ in the congresses of the First International the libertarian idea of self - management prevailed over the statist concept . ” [ 188 ]
Moreover , at Basel Congress of 1869 “ Bakunin emerged as the main champion of collectivism . ” [ 189 ]
As Kropotkin suggested :
“ As to his economical conceptions , Bakunin described himself , in common with his Federalist comrades of the International ( César De Paepe , James Guillaume , Schwitzguébel ) , a ‘ collectivist anarchist ’... a state of things in which all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communes , while the ways of retribution of labour , communist or otherwise , would be settled by each group for itself . ” [ 190 ]
So the rise of the collectivists in the IWMA does not represent a defeat for Proudhon ’s ideas .
Rather , it reflected their development by debates between socialists heavily influenced by the anarchist .
This is obscured by the fact that Proudhon ’s ideas on workers ’ associations are not well known today .
Once this is understood , it is easy to see that it was in the IWMA that Proudhon ’s mutualist ideas evolved into collectivist and then communist anarchism .
The main areas of change centred on means ( reform versus revolution ) and the need for strikes , unions and other forms of collective working class direct action and organisation rather than the goal of a federated , associated , self - managed socialist society .
As G.D.H.
Cole perceptively writes , Varlin “ had at bottom a great deal more in common with Proudhon than with Marx ” and had a “ Syndicalist outlook . ” [ 191 ]
Like Bakunin , Varlin argued that unions have “ the enormous advantage of making people accustomed to group life and thus preparing them for a more extended social organisation .
They accustom people not only to get along with one another and to understand one another , but also to organise themselves , to discuss , and to reason from a collective perspective . ”
Again , like Bakunin , Varlin argued that unions also “ form the natural elements of the social edifice of the future ; it is they who can be easily transformed into producers associations ; it is they who can make the social ingredients and the organisation of production work . ” [ 192 ]
Thus , by 1868 “ a transition from mutualism to ‘ antistatist ’ or ‘ antiauthoritarian collectivism ’ had began . ” [ 193 ]
This is to be expected .
Just as Proudhon developed his ideas in the face of changing circumstances and working class self - activity , so working class people influenced by his ideas developed and changed what they took from Proudhon in light of their own circumstances .
However , the core ideas of anti-statism and anti-capitalism remained and so these changes must be viewed as a development of Proudhon ’s ideas rather than something completely new or alien to them .
Thus the revolutionary anarchism which grew within the IWMA had distinct similarities to that of Proudhon ’s reformist kind , even if it diverges on some issues .
By 1871 , the transition from reformist mutualism to revolutionary collectivism as the predominant tendency within anarchism was near complete .
Then came the Paris Commune .
With its ideas on decentralised federations of communes and workers ’ associations , the Commune applied Proudhon ’s ideas on a grand scale and , in the process , inspired generations of socialists .
Sadly , this revolt , Proudhon ’s greatest legacy , has been appropriated by Marxism thanks to Marx ’s passionate defence of the revolt and his and Engels systematic downplaying of its obvious Proudhonian themes .
In reality , while many perspectives were raised in the revolt , what positive themes it expressed were taken from Proudhon as many Communards “ were influenced by Proudhon ’s advocacy of autonomous economic organisation and decentralised self - government . ”
Thus the Commune reflected “ a distinctly French variant of socialism , strongly influenced by Proudhon and to a lesser extent by the Russian anarchist Bakunin , which advocated destroying oppressive state structures by devolving power to local democratic communities ( federalism ) and abolishing exploitation by decentralising economic control to workers ’ co-operative associations – ‘ Its apostles are workers , its Christ was Proudhon , ’ proclaimed Courbet . ” [ 194 ]
So it is that we find the Paris section of the IWMA in 1870 arguing along very Proudhonian lines that “ we must accomplish the Democratic and Social Revolution . ”
The aim was “ the establishment of a new social order ; the elimination of classes , the abolition of employers and of the proletariat , the establishment of universal co-operation based upon equality and justice . ”
Thus “ it is necessary , citizens , to eliminate wage labour , the last form of servitude , ” “ implement the principles of justice in social relationships ” and ensure the “ distribution of what is produced by labour , based upon the principles of the value of the work and a mutualist organisation of services . ”
“ Has it not always been evident ” , they asked , “ that the art of governing peoples has been the art of exploiting them ? ” [ 195 ]
As Paul Avrich suggested , the “ influence of Proudhon – unquestionably greater than that of Marx – was reflected in the title of ‘ Federals ’ by which the Communards were known . ”
The Commune ’s “ social composition ... was a mixture of workers and professionals , of tradesmen and artisans ... its thrust was overwhelmingly decentralist and libertarian , ” its ideal society was “ a direct democracy of councils , clubs , and communes , an anti-authoritarian commonwealth in which workers , artisans , and peasants might live in peace and contentment , with full economic and political liberty organised from below . ” [ 196 ] “ [ I ] n reality , ” Thomas concedes , “ the Commune owed precious little to Marxism and a great deal more , ironically enough , to the Proudhonists , who had proved themselves thorns in Marx ’s side during the first four years of the International ’s existence . ” [ 197 ]
This Proudhonian influence on the Paris Commune was expressed in two main ways : politically in the vision of a France of federated communes ; economically in the vision of a socialist society based on workers ’ associations .
Politically , Proudhon “ had stressed the commune as the fundamental unit of democratic sovereignty ” [ 198 ] as well as their federation .
All this was reflected in the Commune .
Indeed , the “ rough sketch of national organisation which the Commune had no time to develop ” [ 199 ] which Marx praised but did not quote was written by a follower of Proudhon and was “ strongly federalist in tone , and it has a marked proudhonian flavour . ” [ 200 ]
Marx also praised the Communal Council being composed of delegates who would be “ at any time revocable and bound by the mandat imperatif ( formal instructions ) of his constituents ” and the fact that it was a “ working , not a parliamentary , body , executive and legislative at the same time ”
This , he averred , was “ the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economical emancipation of labour . ” [ 201 ]
Yet this was not a novel “ discovery ” as Proudhon had consistently raised these ideas since the 1848 revolution :
“ It is up to the National Assembly , through organisation of its committees , to exercise executive power , just the way it exercises legislative power ...
Besides universal suffrage and as a consequence of universal suffrage , we want implementation of the binding mandate .
Politicians balk at it !
Which means that in their eyes , the people , in electing representatives , do not appoint mandatories but rather abjure their sovereignty !
That is assuredly not socialism : it is not even democracy . ” [ 202 ]
During the Commune anarchist James Guillaume pointed out the obvious : “ the Paris Revolution is federalist ... in the sense given it years ago by the great socialist , Proudhon . ”
It is “ above all the negation of the nation and the State . ” [ 203 ]
It is hard not to concur with K.J. Kenafick :
“ the programme [ the Commune ] set out is ... the system of Federalism , which Bakunin had been advocating for years , and which had first been enunciated by Proudhon .
The Proudhonists ... exercised considerable influence in the Commune .
This ‘ political form ’ was therefore not ‘ at last ’ discovered ; it had been discovered years ago ; and now it was proven to be correct by the very fact that in the crisis the Paris workers adopted it ... as being the form most suitable to express working class aspirations . ” [ 204 ]
Economically , the same can be said .
Echoing Proudhon ’s calls for workers ’ companies , the Communards considered that “ the worker - directed workshop ... very soon would become the universal mode of production . ” [ 205 ]
A meeting of the Mechanics Union and the Association of Metal Workers argued that “ our economic emancipation ... can only be obtained through the formation of workers ’ associations , which alone can transform our position from that of wage earners to that of associates . ”
They instructed their delegates to the Commune ’s Commission on Labour Organisation to aim for the “ abolition of the exploitation of man by man , the last vestige of slavery ” by means of the “ organisation of labour in mutual associations with collective and inalienable capital . ”
A group of foundry workers wrote that it was “ exploitation that we seek to abolish through the right of workers to their work and to form federated producer co-operatives .
Their formation would be a great step forward ... towards ... the federation of peoples . ” [ 206 ]
Marx praised the efforts made within the Paris Commune to create co-operatives , so “ transforming the means of production , land and capital ... into mere instruments of free and associated labour . ”
He argued “ what else ... would it be but ... Communism ? ” [ 207 ]
Well , it could be mutualism and Proudhon ’s vision of an agro-industrial federation .
Had not Varlin , in March 1870 , argued that co-operatives were “ actively preparing the bases for the future society ” ?
Had he not , like Proudhon , warned that “ placing everything in the hands of a highly centralised , authoritarian state ... would set up a hierarchic structure from top to bottom of the labour process ” ?
Had he not , like Proudhon , suggested that “ the only alternative is for workers themselves to have the free disposition and possession of the tools of production ... through co-operative association ” ? [ 208 ]
Engels in 1891 painted a picture of Proudhon being opposed to association ( except for large - scale industry ) and stated that “ to combine all these associations in one great union ” was “ the direct opposite of the Proudhon doctrine ” and so the Commune was its “ grave ” .
[ 209 ]
Yet , as he most certainly was aware , Proudhon had publicly called for economic federation .
In 1863 , he termed it the “ agro- industrial federation ” and fifteen years earlier he had demanded an economy based on a “ vast federation ” of “ democratically organised workers ’ associations ” [ 210 ] so making true his 1846 statement that “ to unfold the system of economical contradictions is to lay the foundations of universal association . ” [ 211 ]
Elsewhere , Engels argued that the “ economic measures ” of the Commune were driven not by “ principles ” but by “ simple , practical needs . ”
This meant that “ the confiscation of shut - down factories and workshops and handing them over to workers ’ associations ” had been “ not at all in accordance with the spirit of Proudhonism but certainly in accordance with the spirit of German scientific socialism . ” [ 212 ]
This seems unlikely , given Proudhon ’s well known and long - standing advocacy of co-operatives as well as Marx ’s comment in 1866 that in France the workers ( “ especially those in Paris ” ) “ are , without realising it [! ] , strongly implicated in the garbage of the past ” and that the “ Parisian gentlemen had their heads stuffed full of the most vacuous Proudhonist clichés . ” [ 213 ]
Given that the Communist Manifesto stressed state ownership and failed to mention co-operatives , the claim that the Commune had acted in its spirit seems a tad optimistic particularly as this decision “ bore the mark of the French socialist tradition , which envisaged workers ’ co-operative association , not state ownership , as the solution to ‘ the social question . ’ ” [ 214 ]
The obvious influence of Proudhon in the Commune ’s socio-economic vision has been obscured by Marxist revisionism .
These links with Proudhon are hardly surprising as “ men sympathetic to Proudhon ’s ideas were conspicuously present ” in the revolt .
[ 215 ]
This is not to suggest that the Paris Commune unfolded precisely as Proudhon would have wished ( Bakunin and Kropotkin analysed it and drew conclusions from its failings [ 216 ] ) .
However , it is clear that the Commune ’s vision of a federated self - managed society and economy owes much to Proudhon ’s tireless advocacy of such ideas .
As Bakunin suggested , Marx and Engels “ proclaim[ing ] that [ the Commune ’s ] programme and purpose were their own ” flew “ in face of the simplest logic ” and was “ a truly farcical change of costume . ” [ 217 ]
Proudhon ’s lasting legacy is his contribution to anarchism .
It is little wonder that he has been termed “ the father of anarchism ” for while anarchism has evolved since Proudhon ’s time it still bases itself on the themes first expounded in a systematic way by the Frenchman .
Indeed , it is hard to imagine anarchism without Proudhon .
While Proudhon may not have been the first thinker to suggest a stateless and classless society , he was the first to call himself an anarchist and to influence a movement of that name .
This is not to suggest that libertarian ideas and movements had not existed before Proudhon [ 218 ] nor that anarchistic ideas did not develop spontaneously after 1840 but these were not a coherent , named , articulate theory .
While anarchism does not have to be identical to Proudhon ’s specific ideas and proposals , it does have to be consistent with the main thrust of his ideas – in other words , anti-state and anti-capitalism .
Thus collectivist anarchism built on Proudhon , as did communist - anarchism , anarcho - syndicalism and individualist anarchism .
While none of these later developments were identical to Proudhon ’s mutualism – each stressed different aspects of his ideas , developing some , changing others – the links and evolution remain clear .
Proudhon straddles both wings of the anarchist movement , social and individualist although the former took more of his vision of libertarian socialism . [ 219 ]
Perhaps this division was inevitable considering Proudhon ’s ideas .
He was , after all , an advocate of both competition and association , against both capitalism and communism , a reformist who talked constantly of revolution .
Suffice to say , though , both wings considered themselves , as did Proudhon , part of the wider socialist movement and hoped to see the end of capitalism while disagreeing on how to do so and the exact nature of a free society .
Whether Proudhon would have agreed with Tucker or Kropotkin is a moot point ( probably not ! ) but he would have recognised elements of his ideas in both .
Proudhon ’s ideas found a welcome home in North America where “ his impact was greater than has been commonly supposed ” , with his “ views given wide publicity ” in “ the years preceding the Civil War . ” [ 220 ]
This makes sense , given that ( like France ) the USA was going through the process of industrialisation and proletarianisation with the state intervening in the economy ( as it always has ) to foster capitalist property rights and social relationships .
Radicals in America , facing the same transformation as Proudhon ’s France , took up his ideas and propagated them .
While Josiah Warren had independently advocated certain ideas usually associated with Proudhon , the first study of Proudhon ’s work was Charles A. Dana ’s Proudhon and His “ Bank of the People ” in 1849 followed by William B. Greene ’s translations from Proudhon ’s Organisation du Crédit et de la Circulation et Solution du Problème Social his 1850 Mutual Banking .
Greene was president of the Massachusetts Labour Union and was active in the French - speaking section of the IWMA in Boston although , unlike Proudhon , he “ championed the cause of women ’s rights . ” [ 221 ]
For Greene there was “ no device of the political economists so infernal as the one which ranks labour as a commodity , varying in value according to supply and demand ...
To speak of labour as merchandise is treason ; for such speech denies the true dignity of man ...
Where labour is merchandise in fact ... there man is merchandise also , whether in England or South Carolina . ”
The alternative was the “ triple formula of practical mutualism ” : “ the associated workshop ” for production , the “ protective union store ” for consumption and “ the Mutual Bank ” for exchange .
All three were required , for “ the Associated Workshop cannot exist for a single day without the Mutual Bank and the Protective Union Store . ”
The “ Associated Workshop ought to be an organisation of personal credit .
For what is its aim and purpose ?
Is it not the emancipation of the labourer from all dependence upon capital and capitalists ? ” [ 222 ]
Benjamin Tucker took up Greene ’s work and translated substantial material by Proudhon into English including numerous articles , What is Property ? and volume one of System of Economic Contradictions .
In 1881 , he proclaimed that his new journal , Liberty , was “ brought into existence as a direct consequence of the teachings of Proudhon ” and “ lives principally to emphasise and spread them . ” [ 223 ]
Proudhon ’s maxim from the 1848 revolution that “ Liberty , Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order ” adorned its masthead .
Like Proudhon , his aim was the “ emancipation of the workingman from his present slavery to capital . ” [ 224 ]
To achieve this , Tucker looked to Proudhon as well as the radical ideas and movements of his own country .
He took Proudhon ’s reformism , his “ occupancy and use ” critique of land - ownership , elimination of interest by mutual banking , opposition to the state and defence of competition and markets .
Somewhat ironically , while Tucker is often portrayed as being Proudhon ’s disciple he ignored many of the French anarchist ’s key ideas .
Workers ’ associations and co-operative production , the agro- industrial federation , communes and their federation find no echo in Tucker , nor did Proudhon ’s opposition to wage - labour .
Somewhat ironically it was Tucker ’s arch - foe in the movement , the communist - anarchist Johann Most , who echoed the French anarchist on most issues .
Other individualist anarchists were closer to Proudhon ’s concerns .
Dyer Lum “ drew from the French anarchist Proudhon ... a radical critique of classical political economy and ... a set of positive reforms in land tenure and banking ...
Proudhon paralleled the native labour reform tradition in several ways .
Besides suggesting reforms in land and money , Proudhon urged producer cooperation . ”
As with Proudhon ’s , a key element of “ Lum ’s anarchism was his mutualist economics , an analysis of ‘ wage slavery ’ and a set of reforms that would ‘ abolish the wage system . ’ ” [ 225 ]
Other individualist anarchists joined Lum in opposing wage - labour . [ 226 ]
While individualist anarchism dominated the movement in America before and immediately after the Civil War , by the 1880s the displacement of reformist by revolutionary forms of anarchism which had occurred in Europe was repeated in America .
While the repression after the Haymarket police riot in 1886 hindered this , “ [ b ] y the turn of the century , the anarchist movement in America had become predominantly communist in orientation . ” [ 227 ]
While individualist anarchism never totally disappeared , to this day it remains very much the minority trend in American anarchism .
Even a cursory glance at revolutionary anarchism shows the debt it has to Proudhon .
Bakunin , unsurprisingly , considered his own ideas as “ Proudhonism widely developed and pushed right to these , its final consequences . ” [ 228 ]
Proudhon ’s critique of property , state and capitalism , his analysis of exploitation being rooted in wage - labour , his advocacy of a decentralised and federal system of communes and workers ’ associations , his support for workers ’ self - management of production , his call for working class autonomy and self - activity as the means of transforming society from below , all these ( and more ) were taken up and developed by collectivist , communist and syndicalist anarchists .
Just as Proudhon had pointed to the directly democratic clubs of the 1848 Revolution and co-operatives as key institutions of a free society , so Bakunin viewed communes and unions in the same light while , in addition to these , Kropotkin pointed to the directly democratic “ sections ” of the Great French Revolution .
As with Proudhon , the revolutionary anarchists argued that political and social change must occur at the same time .
Like Proudhon , they saw the future free society as a dual federation of social and economic organisations .
For Kropotkin “ the form that the Social Revolution must take ” was “ the independent Commune ” and their federations along with “ a parallel triumph of the people in the economic field ” based on “ associations of men and women who would work on the land , in the factories , in the mines , and so on ” and so become “ themselves the managers of production . ” [ 229 ]
For Bakunin , “ socialism is federalist ” and “ true federalism , the political organisation of socialism , will be attained only ” when “ popular grass - roots institutions ” like “ communes , industrial and agricultural associations ” are “ organised in progressive stages from the bottom up . ” [ 230 ]
The links with Proudhon ’s ideas , particularly the agro- industrial federation , are all too clear .
Revolutionary anarchism bases itself on Proudhon ’s distinction between property and possession . [ 231 ]
It shares his vision of an economy based on socialisation of the means of production , use rights and workers ’ association .
Kropotkin ’s co-founder of the newspaper Freedom , Charlotte M. Wilson , made the link clear :
“ Proudhon ’s famous dictum , ‘ Property is theft ’ , is the key to the equally famous enigma ...
‘ From each according to his capacities , to each according to his needs ’... as long as land and capital are un-appropriated , the workers are free , and that , when these have a master , the workers also are slaves ...
Anarchism proposes , therefore , – 1 .
That usufruct of instruments of production – land included – should be free to all workers , or groups of workers .
2 . That the workers should group themselves , and arrange their work as their reason and inclination prompt ...
3 . That the necessary connections between the various industries and branches of trade should be managed on the same voluntary principle . ” [ 232 ]
Revolutionary anarchism nevertheless differed from that of Proudhon in three areas .
First , its proponents rejected Proudhon ’s support for patriarchy in the family as being inconsistent with the libertarian principles he advocated against capitalism and the state . [ 233 ]
This was an obvious self - contradiction , which anarchists have critiqued by means of the very principles Proudhon himself used to criticise the state and capitalism .
Joseph Déjacque , for example , wrote a critique of Proudhon ’s sexist views in 1857 , urging him to renounce “ this gender aristocracy that would bind us to the old regime . ” [ 234 ]
André Léo , a feminist libertarian and future Communard , pointed out the obvious contradiction in 1869 : “ These so - called lovers of liberty , if they are unable to take part in the direction of the state , at least they will be able to have a little monarchy for their personal

For years , the all - consuming international struggle against the scourge of terrorism has been hampered at times by the fact that no one has been able to provide us with a rock - solid , comprehensive definition of the term .
What , exactly , is " terrorism ? "
Great minds have grappled with this question in learned journals , academic symposia , think - tank fora , government entmoots , and across the commanding heights of the media .
The matter is of some moment , as any person or organization to whom this ill - defined label is applied automatically becomes a target for " the path of action , " to borrow the stirring phraseology of former U.S. president George W. Bush .
Indeed , some cynics have advanced the notion that the definition of terrorism has been left vague deliberately , in order to retain the degree of elasticity necessary for the term 's application where and when as needed to advance one 's particular political or ideological agenda .
Of course , those who lack the phrenological bump of cynicism would ascribe this confusion to the artless , inherent difficulties of semantic expression all too common to our human kind .
In any case , there has been , as the saying goes , much throwing about of brains on the subject , and to little effect .
But now this intractable problem has been resolved at last .
And as you might expect , the man who cut this Gordian knot is one of the towering and tireless intellects of our age : Bill Clinton .
To my shame , I have only recently become acquainted with his breakthrough , which was published in the December 2009 issue of Foreign Policy magazine .
The chagrin I feel at my ignorance is mitigated somewhat by the fact that Mr. Clinton 's brilliant formulation seems to have been largely ignored .
This is no doubt because it was embedded in the vast sea of verbal gems and dazzling aperçus that the former president poured forth in his charmingly voluble fashion .
( For instance , who could fail to be dazzled by this Clintonian insight : " Tom Friedman is our most gifted journalist at actually looking at what is happening in the world and figuring out its relevance to tomorrow and figuring out a clever way to say it that sticks in your mind -- like " real men raise the gas tax . "
You know what I mean ? "
For more on this gifted journalist and his remarkable turns of phrase , see here .
Mr. Clinton also lauded " big thinkers on the question of identity " like " Samuel Huntingdon , who wrote the famous book , The Clash of Civilizations . "
Huntingdon 's book has indeed been influential , perhaps decisive , in shaping the worldview of our leading statesmen and opinion - shapers – despite the petty quibbling from second - raters , like Nobelist Amartya Sen ( author of Identity and Violence ) , who claim that Huntingdon 's magisterial wisdom is in reality somewhat lacking in intellectual heft and moral substance ; some go so far as to claim his work is actually shallow , reductive , highly toxic racist tripe .
But of course Mr. Clinton and our great and good know better . )
Thus primed with these sprays and sprigs of genius from the emeritus statesman , it is no surprise when we stumble onto his definitive definition of terrorism , tossed off almost casually in the midst of a disquisition on just how long the clash of civilizations known as the War on Terror might last .
Cutting to the chase , as is ever his wont , Clinton nails the truth about terrorism :
Terror mean [s ] killing and robbery and coercion by people who do not have state authority and go beyond national borders .
Like a bolt of sunlight breaking through a lowering cloud , Clinton 's formulation floods one 's brain with sudden illumination .
" Killing and robbery and coercion by people who do not have state authority " – that 's terrorism .
Killing and robbery and coercion by people who do have state authority is , obviously , something else altogether : humanitarian intervention , perhaps , or liberation , or preservation of national security , or maintaining great - power credibility , or restoring hope , or a pre-dawn vertical insertion .
In this Feb. 11 , 2010 photo provided by NASA , astronaut Nicholas Patrick participates in the first session of extravehicular activity as construction and maintenance continue on the International Space Station .
( AP Photo / NASA )
( AP ) -- Astronauts ran into trouble Saturday while setting up the International Space Station 's newest room , Tranquility : A critical insulating cover does not fit .
The fabric , multilayered cover is supposed to go between Tranquility and its observation deck , but the metal bars are not locking down properly because of interference from a hand rail or some other structure at the hatch .
Flight director Bob Dempsey said engineers are trying to figure out how to proceed .
Until this snag , everything had been going smoothly in NASA 's final major construction job at the space station .
Shuttle Endeavour delivered Tranquility and the attached lookout - an enormous bay window - earlier this week .
The cover is needed to protect Tranquility 's seals and docking mechanisms from the cold .
This port will be exposed , temporarily , when the domed lookout is moved to its permanent location on the other side of Tranquility .
That relocation is supposed to happen Sunday , but may be delayed .
Dempsey said the astronauts may be asked to remove the interfering pieces or , possibly , do away with the cover entirely and proceed with the original relocation plan .
Once the lookout is moved , a docking adapter will take its place so the port would not be exposed for too long , provided nothing else went wrong .
Another option , Dempsey said , may be to hold off on moving the observation deck until a properly fitting cover can be flown on another shuttle flight .
Only four more shuttle missions remain .
The next visit is scheduled for mid to late March .
The $ 27 million , Italian - built observation deck sports the biggest window ever flown in space .
In all , there are seven windows that will offer 360 - degree views .
The 11 astronauts aboard the shuttle - station complex opened the door Friday to the $ 380 million Tranquility , also made in Italy for the European Space Agency .
The door leading from Tranquility into the observation deck was opened soon afterward , and that 's when shuttle pilot Terry Virts and Kay Hire encountered the cover problem .
That did n't stop the astronauts from routing cables and water lines into Tranquility , and hauling in an exercise machine and other equipment .
" I will tell you , we 're filling it up very quickly , " Hire said in an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday morning .
" We 're loading all kinds of equipment in there and starting to bring it to life . "
Virts said Tranquility had that " new spaceship smell " when the hatch swung open .
He described the odor as unique , " almost a space smell to it . "
Tranquility was installed on the space station early Friday during the first spacewalk of the mission .
Two spacewalkers will venture back out Saturday night to set up plumbing needed for Tranquility 's cooling system .
Virts said this week 's events remind him of the completion of America 's transcontinental railroad .
" When it was done , it opened up the West , let our country become the nation that we are today , " he told the AP .
With the addition of Tranquility and the lookout , this " is the beginning of a future of space exploration that a long time from now , we 'll look back on and see in a similar vein . "

From construction laborers and secretaries to physicians and lawyers , people experience better moods , greater vitality , and fewer aches and pains from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon , concludes the first study of daily mood variation in employed adults to be published in the January 2010 issue of the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology .
And that ' weekend effect ' is largely associated with the freedom to choose one 's activities and the opportunity to spend time with loved ones , the research found .
" Workers , even those with interesting , high status jobs , really are happier on the weekend , " says author Richard Ryan , a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester .
" Our findings highlight just how important free time is to an individual 's well - being , " Ryan adds .
" Far from frivolous , the relatively unfettered time on weekends provides critical opportunities for bonding with others , exploring interests and relaxing -- basic psychological needs that people should be careful not to crowd out with overwork , " Ryan cautions .
The study tracked the moods of 74 adults , aged 18 to 62 , who worked at least 30 hours per week .
For three weeks , participants were paged randomly at three times during the day , once in the morning , the afternoon and the evening .
At each page , participants completed a brief questionnaire describing the activity in which they were engaged and , using a seven - point scale , they rated their positive feelings like happiness , joy , and pleasure as well as negative feelings of anxiety , anger , and depression .
Physical symptoms of stress , such as headaches , digestive problems , respiratory ills , or low energy , also were noted .
The results demonstrated that men and women alike consistently feel better mentally and physically on the weekend .
They feel better regardless of how much money they make , how many hours they work , how educated they happen to be , or whether they work in the trades , the service industry , or in a professional capacity .
They feel better whether they are single , married , living together , divorced , or widowed .
And , they feel better regardless of age .
To tease out exactly why weekend hours are so magical , the researchers asked participants to indicate whether they felt controlled versus autonomous in the task they were engaged in at the time of the pager signal .
Participants also indicated how close they felt to others present and how competent they perceived themselves to be at their activity .
The findings indicated that relative to workdays , weekends were associated with higher levels of freedom and closeness : people reported more often that they were involved in activities of their own choosing and spending time with more intimate friends and family members .
Surprisingly , the analysis also found that people feel more competent during the weekend than they do at their day - to - day jobs .
The results support self - determination theory , which holds that well - being depends in large part on meeting one 's basic psychological needs for autonomy , competence , and relatedness .
This study , conclude the authors , " offers one of the first substantive and theory - based explanations for why wellbeing tends to be more favorable on the weekends :
People experience greater autonomy and relatedness , which are , in turn , related to higher wellness . "
By contrast , write the authors , the work week " is replete with activities involving external controls , time pressures , and demands on behavior related to work , child care and other constraints . "
Workers also may spend time among colleagues with whom they share limited emotional connections .
The study also raises questions about how work environments can be structured to be more supportive of wellness .
" To the extent that daily life , including work , affords a sense of autonomy , relatedness , and competence , well - being may be higher and more stable , rather than regularly rising and falling , " the researchers conclude .
The weekend effect study was coauthored by Jessey Bernstein , professor of psychology from McGill University , and Kirk Warren Brown , professor of psychology from Virginia Commonwealth University .
SeattleCrime.com is reporting a strange incident last month , just released in an SPD report .
Apparently a woman told police she was attacked by a man inside his Interbay apartment , in the 3800 block of 14th Ave W , on January 27 after she refused to sleep with him .
According to SeattleCrime.com , the police report noted that the woman had been recently arrested for prostitution and is currently homeless .
The records state that the woman went with the man to a party at his apartment that evening , later sleeping on his couch .
She told police that the man , described as a white male wearing an eye patch , woke her in the during the night and put “ his thing in [ her ] face ” , kicking and punching her when she “ would n’t put out . ”
Police took the woman ’s report and attempted to contact the man at his apartment , but were unable to find him .
Following World War II , many of the nations of the world came together to form the United Nations to serve as a forum for international relations .
Indian nations as colonial entities were not viewed as sovereign nations as thus were not a part of the United Nations when it was formed .
In 1948 the United Nations classified genocide as a crime against humanity .
Genocide is identified as an activity against a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group which includes one or more of the following : ( 1 ) killing members of the group , ( 2 ) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group , ( 3 ) inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction , ( 4 ) imposing measures to prevent births within the group , and ( 5 ) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group .
Many Indian people realized that the actions of the United States during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can be viewed as genocide under this definition .
In 1977 the United Nations gave the International Indian Treaty Council status as a Non-Governmental Organization .
Several Indian leaders addressed a United Nations conference in Geneva .
However , the demands of Indian leaders for international recognition of their sovereign nationhood were unheeded .
The conference had no effect on the legal status of Indian tribes in the United States or on their treaties .
The United Nations adopted " Convention On the Rights of the Child " in 1989 .
This act states that indigenous children " have the right to enjoy their own culture and to practice their own religion and language . "
Two nations – the United States and Somalia – did not sign the covenant .
On Human Rights Day in 1992 , several indigenous leaders , including Native American leaders , addressed the United Nations as a part of the opening ceremonies of the International Year of the World ’s Indigenous People .
Onondaga chief Oren Lyons reminded the United Nations : " Our lands were declared vacant by papal bulls .
You created laws to justify the pillaging of our lands .
We were systematically stripped of our resources , religions , and dignity . "
He goes on to say : " Yet we survive .
I stand before you as a manifestation of the spirit of our people and our will to survive .
The wolf , our spiritual brother , stands beside us , and we are alike in the Western mind : hated , admired , and still a mystery to you .
And still undefeated . "
Thomas Banyacya , a Hopi elder from Arizona , told the United Nations that " we still have our ancient sacred stone tablets and spiritual religious societies which are the foundations of the Hopi way of life , " and " if we humans do not wake up to the warnings , the great purification will come to destroy this world just as the previous worlds were destroyed . "
In 2006 the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues called upon the Catholic Pope to revoke and renounce the fifteenth century papal bulls which are the foundation for the Discovery Doctrine .
According to Oren Lyons , Faithkeeper of the Onondaga Nation : " These bulls provide the foundation for the theft of indigenous lands throughout the world that continues up to this day .
These bulls subjugated innocent and unsuspecting Native peoples and subjected them to more than 500 years of slavery , genocide , and a less than human identity . "
Steven Newcomb ( Shawnee / Lenape ) , the Indigenous Law Coordinator at Kumeyaay Community College , writes : " American Indian nations never freely consented to be bound by or to abide by the ideas historically known as the international law of Christendom . "
He goes on to say " The principle of Christian discovery and its accompanying principle of Christian dominion are the illegitimate foundation concepts of U.S. federal Indian law and policy . "
A 2005 report to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights found that Indian prisoners in the United States were facing restrictions on their spiritual practices .
These restrictions included English - only mandates on ceremonies , such as the sweatlodge , and unrealistic time limits on ceremonies which did not allow them to be concluded in native fashion .
According to the report , prison chaplains , who are usually trained as Christian ministers , were required to oversee traditional Native American ceremonies .
In 2005 the United Nations committee on racial discrimination asked the United States to respond to the Western Shoshone appeal for intervention regarding the attack on their spiritual and cultural areas by the United States and mining corporations .
The United Nations asked the United States why Western Shoshone sacred land and treaty rights were not being honored .
The U.S. failed to respond to a list of 10 questions from the United Nations regarding this matter .
In 2005 a formal human rights complaint against the United States was submitted to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights .
The complaint stemmed from methyl - mercury contamination of subsistence fish caused by gold mines which were abandoned following the mid-nineteenth century gold rush in California and by the dumping of contaminates by the U.S. military in Alaska .
These actions , according to the complaint , have impacted the Pit River tribe in California and the Yupik in Alaska .
In California , hundreds of tons of mercury from the abandoned gold mines have resulted in toxic levels of mercury in fish .
For California Indians , these fish have both a food value and a spiritual value .
In Alaska , the occurrence of cancer among Alaska Natives has been rising since 1990 at a rate 30 % higher than for the general population .
Evidence was also included in the complaint that the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Energy , and other federal and state agencies , frequently dismiss links with contaminants as ‘ anecdotal ’ or blame the life - styles of those who are suffering from health problems .
The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2006 discussed a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples .
Article 3 states : " All indigenous peoples have the right of self - determination .
By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic , social , and cultural development . "
Three nations — the United States , Canada , and Australia — argued that this statement was in violation of international human rights law .
In 2007 , the United Nations General Assembly voted to adopt the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples .
The Declaration is a nonbinding agreement that formally established the individual and collective rights of indigenous people .
The United States and Canada were among the four nations that vote against the Declaration .
Some observers of indigenous rights feel that this was most significant development in international human rights law in decades .
As Indian nations become more frustrated with their ability to obtain fairness and understanding in the political process — Congress and the state legislatures — and in the legal process — the courts — they are turning more to international organizations , such as the United Nations and the Organization of American States , to help bring pressure to resolve issues of concern to them .
Vicki Kennedy , widow of the late Sen .
Ted Kennedy , greets Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid following a 60 - 40 cloture vote which is the first step in passing the health care bill .
Senate advances landmark health bill
The Democratic Party ’s decades - long push to remake the U.S. health care system cleared a major hurdle early Monday morning , with the Senate voting to advance a massive $ 871 billion bill to extend coverage to nearly all Americans and tighten regulations on private insurers .
Less than two days after releasing a bill with 383 pages of changes , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) corralled his politically diverse caucus and delivered the 60 votes necessary for the most crucial test vote in the legislative process so far — effectively ensuring the reform package will clear the Senate later this week .

The final tally was a straight party - line vote , 60 - 40 .
All Democrats and two independents voted yes and all Republicans voted no — and each side bitterly accused the other of trying to thwart true reform through petty gamesmanship .
The senators voted just after 1 a.m. while seated at their desks , a rarely used practice implemented only for historic votes .
Adding to the sense of history :
The late Sen .
Ted Kennedy ’s widow , Victoria Kennedy , watched the vote from the Senate gallery , then accepted hugs from a parade of Democratic senators who had just cast votes to move the nation toward Kennedy ’s dream of universal health care .
" I feel fantastic , " Kennedy told a small group of reporters .
" This is an enormous victory . "
Alongside Kennedy , White House health reform czar Nancy - Ann DeParle and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius also watched the Senate vote , a victory for President Barack Obama on his top legislative priority .
" We 're excited and moving on to the next vote , " DeParle told POLITICO .
If the Senate passes the bill as expected — after two more procedural votes this week and a final vote set for 7 p.m. Christmas Eve — House and Senate negotiators will begin the arduous process of melding two substantially different bills .
Democrats are optimistic they can reach a final compromise , but that is by no means ensured .
And within minutes of the vote , two of the final holdouts , Sens. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) and Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) were already threatening to withhold their votes if the bill drifts closer to the House bill , which includes a public health insurance option and different ways to pay for reform .
“ Conferences with the House often split the difference .
This is a very fragile balance that brought 60 together .
So I think it 's critically important if we 're going to adopt health care reform legislation that the bill that comes back from conference is essentially what passed the Senate , ” Lieberman said .
“ I know that 's asking a lot of our colleagues in the House , but that 's the practicality of where we are . ”
Those are fighting words to House members — who bristle at being dictated to by the upper chamber — but some House Democrats have acknowledged they may have little choice but to stick with the bulk of the Senate bill , if they hope to preserve health reform .
Monday ’s vote to continue with debate presented the clearest threat yet to the bill .
Most senators viewed the vote — even though it was a procedural motion — as a vote on the bill itself .
This left Reid with no margin for error , forcing him to strike a compromise that would appeal to a self - described socialist from Vermont ( Sen. Bernie Sanders ) , an increasingly conservative independent from Connecticut ( Lieberman ) and every Democrat in between .
Until Reid secured Nelson ’s support late Friday night , the bill was in doubt .
But after nearly a year of discussion and debate on health reform , there was little suspense about the final outcome of the early - morning vote .
One by one , wavering Democrats announced their intentions to vote yes — just as every single Republican announced plans to vote no .
Just moments before the vote , Reid said , “ We have before us the ability to provide quality health care to every American , and we have the ability to treat our unhealthy health care system .
That ’s what this historic bill does . ”
But Democrats also made clear that they felt Republicans were n’t playing fair by taking up every hour of debate available to them — which would lead to the vote on the night before Christmas .
" It 's up to [ Senate Republican leader ]
Mitch McConnell if we stay here through Christmas .
If he thinks it 's good theater , I guess we 'll stay , ” said Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - N.Y . ) .
“ But the die is cast .
This bill is now going to pass the Senate . "
Republicans shot back that it was the Democrats who were ramming through a massive piece of legislation on a hurried wee - hours roll call .
McConnell ( R - Ky . ) said it amounted to " a couple of cheap deals and a rushed vote at 1 o'clock in the morning .
And Americans are wondering tonight , how did this happen ? "
“ It is one of the most consequential votes any of us will take , but make no mistake , if the people who wrote this bill were proud of it , they would n’t be forcing this vote in the dead of night , ” he said .
As of Monday morning , Republicans still sounded ready to dig in , with Sen. John McCain saying they ’d fight until the final vote .
The only Republican who even considered backing the plan , Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , was still being courted by the White House even at midnight , with legislative liaison Phil Schiliro approaching Snowe as she got off an elevator in the Capitol .
Snowe met Obama again Saturday , a continuation of the intense personal appeal by the president .
Snowe voted no Monday morning , but left open her final vote .
“ It depends on what it is and the direction it moves in .
I will continue to work with them , " she told reporters .
The bill would extend coverage to 31 million uninsured Americans by expanding Medicaid , creating new insurance subsidies , setting up a national insurance marketplace and offering private plans nationwide administered by the same federal agency that oversees federal employee benefits .
No longer could firms deny insurance over pre-existing conditions or set a lifetime limit on benefits .
But the plan falls far short of Obama ’s initial vision for reform in one key regard —
Democrats stripped out a government - run insurance option after several moderate Democrats said they ’d block the bill if it remained .
That decision has drawn sharp fire from the party ’s liberals , who have said the Senate plan is n’t true reform and would merely enrich private insurers — setting up a showdown with moderates , who have threatened to walk if liberals try to force it back in .
Obama has had increasing trouble from his left flank , which has questioned why he did n’t fight harder for some of their core principles , like a government - run plan .
One of the leading critics of the Democrats ’ approach , former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean , on Sunday toned down his criticism of the Senate bill but made clear he did n’t consider this the final word .
“ This ca n’t be the final version of the bill , ” Dean said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
“ It simply sets us on a track in this country which is expensive and where we ’re going to have lots more political fights . ”
Abortion also roiled the health debate in its closing hours ahead of the Senate vote , as Nelson fought for new restrictions on federal funding of abortion that angered both sides — abortion opponents and those those who favor abortion rights .
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) helped broker the compromise with Nelson and told reporters that she had discussed the language afterward with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who the senator described as supportive .
The partisan tensions , which have grown increasingly toxic , came into sharp relief on the Senate floor ahead of the vote .
McConnell described the bill as a “ mess ” that Americans overwhelmingly opposed .
Highlighting the power of a single senator , McConnell pleaded for one member of the Democratic Caucus to break ranks .
“ Americans are asking Democrats to put party loyalty aside tonight — to put the interests of small - business owners , taxpayers and seniors first , ” he continued .
“ And here ’s the good news — it ’s not too late .
All it takes is one .
One can stop it — or everyone will own it . ”
None answered his call .
Reid was able to hold his caucus together , in part , by writing state - specific provisions that won over senators , one vote at a time .
Nebraska , Vermont and Massachusetts scored $ 1.2 billion in special Medicaid assistance .
Nelson got something for Nebraska the other states did n’t — a permanent exemption from increased state costs for new patients that come into Medicaid through the plan .
Montana , North Dakota , South Dakota , Utah and Wyoming secured higher federal reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals that serve Medicare patients .
Senior citizens in Florida , Pennsylvania and New York will see their Medicare Advantage benefits protected at a time when the program will be trimmed nationwide .
Jim Manley , Reid ’s spokesman , defended the special provisions as “ a normal part of the legislative process . ”
But Republicans , despite their use of similar tools while in the majority , spent Sunday blasting Democrats .
" This process is not legislation .
This process is corruption , ” Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) said .
“ And it 's corruption that 's obvious to the average American in this country , " Coburn said .
" And it 's a shame that that 's the only way we can come to consensus in this country is to buy votes . "
Coburn also blasted a mystery provision tucked into the bill , $ 100 million for a university hospital .
Reid ’s office could not say what senator asked for it , but late Sunday night , Sen .
Chris Dodd fessed up , saying he ’s hoping the money will come to the University of Connecticut .
Dodd is facing a difficult reelection battle .
Coburn also said he hoped one of his fellow senators did n’t show up for the pivotal 1 a.m. vote — an admission that Republicans were powerless to stop the procession of votes toward passage .
“ What the American people ought to pray [ for ] is that somebody can’t make the vote tonight .
That ’s what they ought to pray , ” he said .
Democrats interpreted the comments as a veiled wish that one of them would suffer some misfortune .
Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) challenged Coburn three times to come to the floor to explain what he meant .
Durbin said he tried to contact Coburn through his office and the Senate GOP cloakroom but got no response .
“ I do n’t think it ’s appropriate to be invoking prayer to wish misfortune on a colleague .
And I want him to clarify that , ” Durbin said .
“ He is my friend and I have worked with him .
But this statement goes too far . ”

America ’s IED Nightmare
On one side , the U.S. Department of Defense , armed with billion - dollar budgets , state - of - the - art technological savvy , and the world ’s most formidable military machine .
On the other , tiny groups of fly - by - night guerillas hunkered down in hideouts scattered around the world , scavenging remote - control toys or old artillery shells , soldering wires in ruined buildings or sneaking out to plant fertilizer bombs on moonlit desert roads .
You ’d think that the second bunch would n’t stand a chance .
In fact , though , the makers of improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) are more than holding their own — still — at the cost of thousands of lives among the Americans and their allies around the world .
Though the story did n’t get much attention from the media at large , last month U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates effectively acknowledged that the Pentagon has yet to gain the upper hand in the battle against makeshift bombs .
Some 80 percent of the casualties suffered by U.S troops and their allies in Afghanistan are now attributable to IEDs .
By now , that once - obscure military term has presumably become a commonplace to anyone who ’s been following the news .
Ever since the U.S. and its friends invaded Iraq in the spring of 2003 the homemade bomb has become the weapon of choice for insurgents around the world : not just in Iraq and Afghanistan , but also on battlefields from the Horn of Africa to Southeast Asia .
Two Navy SeaBees ( military engineers ) were killed by an IED in the Philippines at the end of September .
They were the first U.S. casualties in that country since 2002 .
( U.S. defense officials say that some 300 IED incidents are now occurring each month outside of Iraq and Afghanistan . )
The Pentagon certainly has n’t been sleeping .
The U.S. military has repeatedly declared neutralizing the IED threat to be a top priority .
Since 2003 the Department of Defense ( DOD ) has thrown some $ 20 billion at the problem , setting off a gusher of gadgets , training programs , and acronym - studded bureaucratic bailiwicks .
Now Gates has pressed the restart button .
Last month , he announced that he was creating a new military task force , to be headed by two Pentagon heavyweights , " to break down the stovepipes " that have kept the various anti-IED efforts across the national - security bureaucracy from cooperating more effectively .
His decision came soon after the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) issued a scathing report on the Pentagon ’s inefficient and ineffective efforts through a bureaucratic jungle of agencies , working groups , and initiatives .
Among other things , the report criticized the lead DOD agency on the problem , the Joint IED Defeat Organization ( JIEDDO ) , for failing to maintain a database keeping track of the many efforts now tackling the problem throughout the vast American military bureaucracy — which would presumably help reduce unnecessary overlap and waste .
That ’s not to say that JIEDDO and its various affiliates have n’t already accomplished a lot .
Since JIEDDO was founded back in 2006 , it has devised a wide variety of special jammers to block the remote - control signals used by insurgents to set off buried bombs .
It has come up with advanced ground - penetrating radars that can tell operators if there ’s anything suspicious under an unpaved road .
It has promoted the development of sophisticated bomb - disposal and detection robots .
And — even more usefully — JIEDDO has also developed new intelligence - gathering systems for thwarting bomb - making networks and retraining troops on how to deal with the threat in the field .
Ex -JIEDDO chief General Montgomery Meigs , now a professor at Georgetown University ’s Center for Security Studies , boasts that the U.S. military succeeded in reducing the casualty - to - blast ratio of IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan during his tenure .
In 2002 , he says , each bomb explosion caused , on average , six casualties ( wounded and killed ) .
By the end of 2007 , when he left the position , that figure was down to one .
And yet troops continue to die from bomb attacks in Afghanistan at a fearsome rate .
Though the Taliban and their allies were comparatively slow to discover the advantages of using IEDs , over the past two years they ’ve turned roadside bombs into their primary weapon .
Countering that threat in Afghanistan is proving even more of a challenge than it was in Iraq .
Dakota Wood and Andrew Krepinevich of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington points out the makeshift bombs being used against U.S. troops in Afghanistan pose a whole new set of challenges .
Iraq , they note , is a " relatively modernized 20th - century country " with paved roads , a fact that often makes it easier to figure out where bombs might be planted .
Iraqi bomb - makers made ample use of explosives looted from countless Saddam - era munitions dumps scattered around the country — which tended to translate into myriad but comparatively small - scale attacks .
( A Congressional Research Service report on the IED problem a few years ago noted that 40 percent of Saddam - era munitions still were n’t being properly guarded a full year after the invasion . )
By contrast , Afghanistan has almost no modern infrastructure ; the relatively small number of troops there is n’t enough to cover its much larger territory .
And paved roads are virtually nonexistent , making it easier for Afghan insurgents to hide their explosive packages .
In Iraq , the insurgents proved adept at crafting found munitions — everything from hand grenades to 155 - mm howitzer shells — into explosive booby traps .
In Afghanistan , the preferred IED has been the fertilizer bomb .
Even thought the number of " IED incidents " has been lower in Afghanistan , the Taliban have kept casualties high by making their bombs much bigger .
The U.S. and NATO forces have responded with everything from high - tech electronic countermeasures ( to block command signals ) to intense drone surveillance of spots where IED activity tends to be highest .
In some parts of the country American troops have even taken to seizing or buying up fertilizer from farmers — the same farmers who , presumably , have been lectured on the need to replace low - maintenance opium poppies with proper , fertilizer - intensive crops .
The biggest problem for IED - fighters , though , is simply that the target is constantly on the move .
The bomb - makers have proven remarkably deft at upping the explosive ante .
" There ’s one thing the more candid generals will tell you , " says John Bennett , a reporter with U.S. defense weekly Defense News .
" I think they ’ve been caught off guard a bit by how smart the enemy is , how inventive they are . "
" The enemy is n’t very helpful , " admits Meigs .
" He keeps adapting every six months . "
The first Iraqi IEDs were primitive affairs that did n’t always explode like they were supposed to .
But by October 2003 the insurgents had gained enough know - how to blow up an M1A2 Abrams tank , killing two of its crewmen .
U.S. military planners are clearly worried that worse may be in store for their troops in Afghanistan as the Taliban hone their engineering skills .
That speed of adaptation makes it even harder for cumbersome bureaucracies to cope .
The GAO report listed a bewildering mélange of competing or overlapping agencies assigned to deal with the IED threat .
That proliferation is , in part , the somewhat understandable consequence of the way U.S. military planners reacted to the IED problem .
As the casualty figures rose , both defense bureaucrats and congressional policymakers began urging immediate attention to the problem — and providing corresponding amounts of money to get it fixed .
According to Bennett , the Defense News journalist , " Gates is big on reducing redundancy , and he knows that , if you have a Marine program and an Army program that are doing the same things , it makes sense to free up smart people to do other counter - IED systems . "
In retrospect , Bennett says , it looks as though JIEDDO was n’t provided with the " proper bureaucratic muscle " to accomplish its mission .
The two men appointed by Gates to head the new task force are Marine Corps Lt. General John Paxton , the Joint Staff ’s director for operations , as well as Pentagon acquisition chief Ashton Carter — both figures of the required institutional heft .
" What Gates is doing here shows why he ’s a master bureaucrat , " says Bennett .
" If these guys tell you to merge your efforts , chances are you ’re gonna do it . "
Gates has shown similar determination in his high - pressure initiative to design , build , and field a new generation of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected ( MRAP ) vehicles .
By essentially bypassing normal bureaucratic channels , the multibillion - dollar program has succeeded in getting 15,000 of the new vehicles to troops on the battlefield in just two years — lightning speed by Pentagon standards .
Still , no one believes that Gates or his colleagues will be able to solve the problem for good .
It ’s important to remember that the idea of " waging war on the IED " is a metaphor .
Ultimately , notes ex-Marine Wood , you ca n’t hope to eradicate the threat from IEDs any more than you can the threat from bullets .
He warns that the effort to protect soldiers and prevent casualties , while urgently needed , can sometimes lose sight of other vital criteria .
" We place a tremendous value on human life and the prevention casualties , " he says .
" But there are costs to that , too .
You can take a $ 500 artillery round and our response has been a million - dollar MRAP . "
While the " MRAP surge " has succeeded in equipping troops with the much - needed vehicles , the sheer speed of the effort inevitably has brought problems of its own , such as lack of spare parts or adequate maintenance programs .
The services now find themselves saddled with a hodge - podge of vehicles from different manufacturers .
And then there ’s the longer - term issue of what to do with the new MRAP fleet once U.S. troops withdraw from the places they ’re fighting in now .
What ’s more , experts say , keeping troops penned up in ponderous , heavily armored vehicles may keep them safe even while undermining the mission they ’re trying to achieve .
Current U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine demands that troops spend as much time as possible outside of their vehicles , mingling with the local population to build trust and gain information , rather than patrolling the countryside encased in armor .
The weighty MRAPs also guzzle far more fuel than previous vehicles , Wood points out , which in turn entails ever - larger supply convoys to serve them — convoys that then make wonderful targets for the bombers .
But then , of course , tech is n’t the answer to everything .
As all those involved in the counter - IED effort readily acknowledge , beating the bombs is n’t just a matter of coming up with clever gadgets .
It ’s also about developing slippery human skills of perception and intuition .
One recent JIEDDO study tried to figure out which troops were best at detecting concealed IEDs in test landscapes .
Two groups scored especially well : those who had grown up hunting , and those who had grown up in crime - ridden inner cities .
The reason is that the members of both groups have a knack for paying close attention to their surroundings .
The test subjects who had spent their formative years glued to video screens could n’t compete .
Food for thought ?
Playboy has a fascinating article on Dennis Montgomery , the man who conned the CIA , the Department of Homeland Security , the Navy , the Air Force , the Senate Intelligence Committee and even Dick Cheney 's office into his phony anti-terrorist decryption technology .
Montgomery — then co-owner and Chief Technology Officer of Vegas - based " eTreppid Technologies " and a notorious gambler with $ 12 million in debt — staged false demonstrations on his laptop , using his " top secret software " to convince the previous administration about an absolutely stupid idea : Arabic TV station Al Jazeera was transmitting encrypted instructions which included " target coordinates " and flight numbers to sleeping Al Qaeda operatives around the world , using clues in their programming .
How serious was the government about this ?
On December 21 , 2003 , Montgomery fake information fired up all alerts , getting the country into a mass panic attack after Department of Homeland Security 's secretary Tom Ridge announced a risk of an attack " that could either rival or exceed what we experienced on September 11 " based on " credible sources . "
The credible sources was Montgomery .
Nothing ever happened then , but that was the beginning of the scam .
Later , Montgomery declared that the Department of Defense paid his company " $ 30 million in contracts and and appropriated another $ 100 million in their black budget . "

After reading the article , I still can't understand how the hell a crook like this was able to con an entire administration , the largest intelligence agency in the world — who at the end discredited Montgomery 's fake montage — and the most powerful military force , with such a preposterous idea .
Was he really that smart ?
Maybe the key was his relation with Nevada Then - Congressman Jim Gibbons — later accused of using his influence to get this contracts to eTreppid ?
Was it the incompetence of the people in charge at the time ?
Was it their desperation to find any threads that could be used on their own benefit ?
I 'm leaning to a combination of all this possibilities .
Go read the reportage .
It is great Christmas weekend reading .
As a bonus , you would be able to claim that you actually ogled over Playboy for a real article .

DOCTOR STRIVES TO END HER CAREER
By Dr. Renee Tocco
February 4 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
Several years ago , the autism epidemic became so real to me that to this day , people mistake me for the parent of a child on the spectrum .
Until the reality of autism came knocking on my door , I was like most Americans - oblivious to the silent epidemic that is stealing a substantial part of a generation of children .
In retrospect , I suppose I was always destined to dedicate my life to this field .
In the late 1970s my parents began to research childhood vaccines and made the informed choice to not vaccinate .
Even then , they predicted our society would witness first - hand the consequences of a theory implemented without the science to validate its safety and efficacy .
But never did they imagine the illness of autism spectrum disorders , which now shadow the lives of millions of American families .
Today autism , a once rare disorder , affects an alarming number of children .
In the past two decades the prevalence of autism has reached epidemic proportions in our country .
A study released in December 2009 by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) reported that autism prevalence has increased from the 1994 rate of 1 in 150 to 1 in 110 for children born in 1998 .
This is a staggering 57 % increase in just four years .
More children are diagnosed with autism than cancer , diabetes and AIDS combined .
It is indeed the greatest pediatric healthcare concern of the times .
While those on the autism spectrum suffer with sometimes debilitating deficiencies , such as nutritional and immune , the whole country seems to suffer with an equally worrisome deficiency - of education , resources and hope .
It is this deficiency that causes parents to not know about , or be reluctant to try the therapies and treatments that have been reported by thousands of other parents to have improved or even recovered their child from autism .
I once heard of a doctor in my hometown telling parents to be aware of healthcare professionals that did things like recommend the GFCF diet - “ Doctors like that are probably just trying to take your money . ”
I guess I ’m still waiting on the commission checks to come in from those I ’ve shared that concept with .

It is a crime that parents are deterred from some of the most effective treatments and deprived of all hope .
All for the sake of protecting the claim that autism is genetic and not physiologically based .
There is an obvious plot to deter all attention from the environmental causes ; might these causes be incriminating ?
Instead medicine as a whole makes blanket statements and repeats the same rhetoric time and again .
If you tell a lie enough times , even you believe it is real and American seems to be under this dangerous spell .
Yes , I am afraid we have an epidemic of ignorance and denial and the victims are the innocent children of our country .
After extensive training and the honor of working with incredible mentors , I founded the American Chiropractic Autism Board .
We have an ever - growing panel of advisers who oversee Hope For Autism , a BioNutritional Care Training Conference .
It has become my passionate mission to educate my profession about prevention and responsible care for autism .
I truly believe that chiropractors , as primary health care physicians , are destined to change the world of autism .
Chiropractors receive a doctorate degree after an approximate eight years of school and an internship .
However , the profession has one unique characteristic : it is the largest non -drug healing profession in the world .
Pharmaceutical companies , driven by profit , do n’t have the ability to slip their greedy fingers into our scope of practice to affect treatment .
Chiropractic education focuses heavily on normal body function , nutrition , detoxification , healing and restoration ... and this is the prescription children on the spectrum need !
Hope For Autism offers BioNutritional Care training for both chiropractic physicians and the general public .
Bionutritional Care utilizes diagnostic tools and methods of testing to determine the underlying physiological causes of symptoms particular to an individual suffering with a disease or condition .
These underlying physiological conditions include , but are not limited to , chronic fungal , bacterial , viral or parasitic infection , nutritional deficiency , food and inhalant allergies , heavy metal toxicity , systemic inflammation , and immune system deficiencies .
Then , with a focus on natural and non-invasive treatments and modalities , an individual 's fundamental diagnoses are addressed with methods that have been shown to be effective .
I hope that in the next generation autism is no longer increasing at record rates .
I hope that doctors of all kinds will embrace BioNutritional Care and treatments that have been shown to help children heal .
I hope to see the elimination of environmental culprits that are responsible for predestining children to ASD .
And I hope that humanity can learn the important lessons that autism teaches .

I hope that someday soon our current traditional view of autism will be a distant memory - like lobotomies and thalidomide .
I know that right now I am living my purpose .
But more than anything , I hope for a day when there is no longer a need for doctors to provide autism care .
Hope For Autism was created with its end in mind .
The next Hope For Autism Conference , designed for doctors and families , is April 23 – 25 , 2010 in Atlanta , GA .

According to his blog , Kevin visited the Bridges Shopping Centre in Sunderland with his son to spend the £ 10 his father gave the boy on a family visit .
While there , he seated his son on a coin - operated train ride and snapped a photo of him with his cameraphone .
At this point , a Bridges security guard came by and ordered him to stop taking pictures .
He said that it was mall policy , and implied that Kevin was taking pictures because he was a paedophile .
Kevin told him that this was ridiculous and took his son to find his wife and get out of the mall away .
He also took a picture of the security guard " so that if I later wanted to make a complaint to the centre I would be able to identify him . "
Outside of
In a different part of the mall , Kevin was stopped by a police constable who had received a complaint from mall security that a suspicious potential paedophile had been taking pictures on its premises .
The PC threatened to arrest Kevin " for creating a public disturbance " and told him she could order him to delete the photo of his son .
The PC also averred that the Bridges Shopping Centre is a hotbed of paedophile assaults .
For the record :
It 's not clear to me how a fully clothed child on a mall coin - op ride is harmed by having his likeness captured by a camera , even if that camera is in the possession of a paedophile .
And I 'm pretty sure that taking pictures of your kids having fun on rides is n't a warning sign of paedophilia ( I 'm in big trouble if it is ! ) .

h/t Daily Kos : Evangelist Pat Robertson manages to blame Haitians for the earthquake , instead of a shift in tectonic plates :
And you know Christy , something happened a long time ago in Haiti and people might not want to talk about it .
They were under the heel of the French , uh you know Napoleon the third and whatever .
And they got together and swore a pact to the devil .
They said we will serve you if you ’ll get us free from the French .
True Story , and so the Devil said OK it ’s a deal .
And they kicked the French out .
You know , the Haitians revolted and got themselves free .
But ever since they ’ve been cursed by one thing after the other desperately poor .
That island is Hispaniola is one island .
It ’s cut down the middle .
On one side is Haiti on the other side is the Dominican republic .
Dominican Republic is prosperous , healthy , full of resorts , etc..
Haiti is in desperate poverty .
Same island .
The video is here
It is of course morally despicable for Robertson to blame a horrific earthquake on the supposed misdeeds of the distant ancestors of the current victims !
But then , he blamed the September 11 atrocity on the United States , as well .
I have nothing against evangelicals in general , and I know that televangelists are peculiar in typically not being under any church authority and so they can hold very strange views .
But the Robertson type of evangelicalism strikes me as a social pathology that is actively evil and damaging to rational ethical thinking in our republic .
So what in the world is Pat Robertson talking about ?
Presumably he is referring to the Haitian Revolution of the 1790s through independence in 1804 .
The latter part of the revolution was against Napoleon Bonaparte , not against his nephew Napoleon III ( r. as emperor 1852 - 1870 ) .
So Robertson was off by a mere 50 or 60 years .
As Charles Tilly pointed out , all revolutions are multiple revolutions .
The Rights of Man were declared by the French Convention in 1789 .
Thomas Jefferson and other US Founding Fathers were delighted about this , by the way .
Initially it was the mixed - race free mulattoes who agitated to have the Rights of Man applied to them in Haiti .
But then slave revolts broke out and by 1794 the French legislature had abolished slavery in French overseas territories .
So you had urbane , French - speaking free persons of color demanding inclusion in the new liberties proclaimed by the French Republic .
But you also had slave revolts , in which newly - arrived slaves from West Africa ( places such as what is now Benin ) participated –though the organization was probably supplied by longer - established slaves .
The newly - arrived slaves had after all been free Africans not so long ago .
Despite the efforts of French orders such as the Dominicans and Capuchins , many slaves had still not become Christians or wore their Christianity very lightly .
Some proportion of the slaves was Muslim , and some historians have suggested that previous slave revolts were led by Muslims .
Over time , Muslim Africans were forcibly converted to Catholicism .
So some of the slave revolts invoked African religion against white French colonial power .
What many now call voodoo or voudoun is a Haitian version of religious traditions roughly from what is now Benin , Togo , Nigeria and the Congo .
The word just means spirit .
The African slave religious traditions were expressed in Creole or Kreyole , based on Kwa dialects but incorporating elements of French .
One of the [ pdf , p. 223 ] first major events of the Haitian revolution unfolded thusly : “ In 1791 Boukman Dutty , a Vodou priest and one of the leaders of the first wave of slave uprisings in the North of Haiti , led a ceremony in the now - famous Bois - Caïman that launched the revolution and inspired slave revolutionaries to begin destroying plantations . ”
The ceremony allegedly involved the sacrifice of a pig and use of pig blood and a sermon that invoked the good God of African religion to give the slaves liberty and condemned the evil God of the white slave - owners .
It has been argued that this event has been mythologized in subsequent Haitian history - writing .
The traditional account is here .
The slave revolts informed by voudoun , however , were only one of a number of rebellions in the 1790s .
An influence was felt among intellectuals of French Deism and anticlericalism and the privileges of the Catholic Church were abolished .
In the north of the country , mass stopped being said .
But revolutionary leader Toussaint L’Ouverture restored the privileges of the Church in in 1800 .
Subsequent cultural and political struggles after independence in 1804 ( which was accompanied by a massacre or expulsion of French whites after Napoleon ’s invasion force was defeated , causing an exodus of Catholic priests ) again constrained the Church , though a concordat was reached in 1860 .
So Robertson ’s account sees the assertion of African religion in 1791 against slaving Christianity as a ‘ pact with the devil ’ that then led Haiti to be cursed ever after .
But even in his own terms , how does he account for the multiple steps by subsequent Haitian states reinstating privileges for Christianity ?
Even if he does not count Catholicism as Christianity , what about the fact that about a quarter of Haitians are now evangelical Protestants ?
Did n’t the earthquake hit them ?
And , why is West Africa where the initial African version of voudoun originated and is still practiced by a minority , among the least earthquake - prone regions in the world ?
Ultimately , Robertson ’s version of Haitian history as cursed replicates the old racist anti-Black ‘ curse of Ham ’ theme in White American popular religion .
Is he saying that Haitians had less right to revolt against European colonialism than did white Americans ?
( Only about 16 % of colonial - era Americans belonged to a church , so it is n’t as if they were more pious ) .
And , ultimately , his account fails to deal with the sins of slavery and racism in which Southern US Christian traditions –
Baptism , evangelicalism , etc. , were deeply implicated .
There is a Southern Baptist church to this day , almost all - white , precisely because it split from the national organization to protect the enslavement of African - Americans .
Evil and the devil are tricky .
Robertson projected them on a revolt of African slaves asserting their African traditions against oppressive white colonial society .
But they lurk in the traditions of his 700 Club , in the exaltation of irrationality , in blaming the victim , in a subtext of racism , and in a failure to repent for White Christian enslavement of Africans for centuries .

Congressman : “ I am concerned what they are going to do to the American people ”
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , December 29 , 2009
Congressman Ron Paul fears that the agenda behind the Flight 253 bombing incident is to expand the war on terror into Yemen while stripping Americans of more liberties , warning that it ’s time people woke up and realized that the government cannot guarantee their safety .
The Congressman highlighted how the bombing attempt followed geopolitical turmoil in Yemen in the form of attacks in the country launched by the Saudis with the endorsement of the U.S. – and how sectors of the media and politicians were now calling for Yemen to be a new front in the war on terror as a consequence of the Christmas Day incident .
“ It seems ironic that there is so much excitement about this and now talk about attacking Yemen , ” said Paul , adding that it was the United States ’ presence in Yemen that represented a threat to America , not the purported presence of Al - Qaeda members in Yemen .
Two days after the incident , influential neo-lib Joe Lieberman cited the attempted plane bombing in calling for Yemen to be the next target of the military - industrial complex after Afghanistan , claiming the plot had links back to the Middle Eastern nation .
Paul raised the question of how a $ 75 billion dollar a year intelligence gathering structure failed to stop a dangerous man who had no passport and was on a terror watch list from boarding a plane .

( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
“ It really scares me because we do so much already – we spend $ 75 billion dollars on intelligence gathering in this country in order to protect us and make us safe , so with $ 75 billion dollars we were n’t able to detect this individual where there ’s a glaring warning sign , ” said Paul , citing the fact that the bomber ’s father tried to warn the U.S. that his son was a threat a month ago .
Paul labeled the nature of the incident , “ Either awful stupidity or there must be an agenda … .
I am concerned what they are going to do to the American people , ” citing how the 9/11 hijackers were also known to the authorities , who were warned that they were only training to learn how to fly a plane and not how to land , but that nothing was ever done about it .
Paul said the people punished for the incident would not be those who failed to stop the terrorist , but the American people .
“ They ’ll add some more security on to us – first they make us take off our shoes and then our belts and then small bottles of water and put our computers in a tray and on and on so something else is going to happen , they wo n’t let us get out of our seats or look at our bags …. thinking that ’s going to make us a lot safer , ” said Paul , adding that security should be managed by airline companies and not the government .
“ The bigger the problem and the more the fear is built up , the more they take away our personal liberties and turn us all into zombies and the American people go along with it and say as long as it makes us safer I guess it ’s OK to go along but it ’s time the American people woke up and started realizing that there ’s a bit of propaganda going on and quite possibly this incident will not only undermine our personal liberties but will also accelerate our intervention and the violence occurring in the Middle East , ” concluded the Congressman .

Comment on this article
A few media outlets are reporting on Irish rocker Bono 's latest rantings .
( See : CBC , New York Times , SlashDot ) .
My SlashDot comment summarises my thinking on his views .
" Give a man a fish and he eats for a day .
Teach him to fish and he eats for a lifetime . "
You forgot the real issue here , which is that Bono , Gates and similar pseudo - philanthropists are actively involved with making a variety of " teaching " ( sharing of knowledge ) expensive and / or illegal .
This is the core of what Bono is ranting about this time , suggesting the world 's governments should go as far as the human rights violations in China to ( theoretically -- no proof of " benefit " ) grant him more money .
There are those who think that making knowledge scarce , including criminalising private citizens owning and controlling their own communications technology , is the only way to make it possible to pay authors / inventors for their important contributions to society .
This ignores all the experience and research to the contrary .
Whether you believe this or not , you must admit that deliberately making knowledge scarce and thus more expensive greatly harms the interests of the worlds poor .
Sharing : the way to Make Poverty History .
The repercussions of deliberately making knowledge scarce will be an underlying issue that will show up in many global conflicts in the next decade , whether talking about poverty , western economic recovery or global climate change .

PROMISES , PROMISES : Pounding the Glass Platform
by LeanneB
If you 've never read through the platform of the Democratic Party , well ... you 're probably not alone .
The thing weighs in at a whopping 59 pages of long , dense paragraphs .
However , I highly recommend that you download it and spend some time poring over it .
Chances are , you 'll be surprised at just how explicitly it outlines its promises to Americans - particularly its promises to women .
Case in point , from page 50 :
Choice The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman ’s right to choose a safe and legal abortion , regardless of ability to pay , and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right .
That would seem to be pretty unequivocal , would n’t it ?
Given that this is the official position of the Democratic Party , would n’t you think that anyone running or serving as a Democrat would either be personally aligned with the pro-choice agenda or , if not , would agree to keep his or her personal reservations out of policymaking and not be an obstacle to the party ’s fulfillment of this promise to women ?
And yet , a Democratic congressman from Michigan , Bart Stupak , saw fit to introduce an amendment to the House health care bill that did n’t just reinforce the Hyde Amendment ( which restricts public funds from being used to pay for abortion services , thereby ensuring that poor women ’s access to abortion is curtailed ) ;
Stupak ’s amendment actually would have extended Hyde ’s reach beyond the lowest economic strata of women by effectively keeping insurance plans that cover abortion off the exchange created by the bill .
Yes .
A Democrat deliberately worked against the explicit promise of his party platform that states that women have a right to abortion regardless of ability to pay .
It 's bad enough - DEPLORABLE enough - that congressional Dems commit this specific betrayal each and every year with the annual renewal of Hyde .
But what Stupak did was to quite deliberately and brazenly take that betrayal to a new height , stunning in its utter disregard for his obligations as a Democrat - and for no other reason than the fact that he is personally against abortion .
He therefore elevated his personal beliefs above the promise the Democratic Party has made to women – a promise he tacitly agreed to uphold by calling himself a Democrat .
He was n’t alone , by any means .
Sixty - four other House Dems voted to add the Stupak Amendment to the bill .
And in the Senate , Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska fought to include Stupakesque language in his house ’s version of the health care bill .
In the end , Harry Reid negotiated to get Nelson to accept a version that left the question of abortion coverage up to the states .
What is clearly , desperately needed at this moment is a revitalization of women ’s advocacy , as noted by the recent front page storyby my colleague Angry Mouse .
Women are justifiably angry about these amendments , but the situation calls for something other than furious rants , declarations of not voting in November , or promoting a third party .
It calls for a strategy for organizing and applying pressure , both to Democrats already in office and to those who will run on the party ’s platform in the future .
Whether this challenge will be taken up by any existing or new advocates remains to be seen .

OUT OF THE SILENCE : On Violence Against Women
by rb137
Humans have lived in violent societies perhaps since their time began , and there is no question that a discussion of violence is not a trivial matter .
That complexity ultimately means that some forms of violence get marginalized over others .
Women are disproportionately affected by two of these minimized crimes : sexual assault and domestic violence .
We do not talk about these subjects openly or comfortably -- there is a deeply personal element .
Having sex is part of most everyone ’s personal life .
Getting mugged is not .
When we read about the latest corner hit , we imagine ourselves in the victim 's shoes and feel terror for him .
And when we hear about acquaintance rape , most of us have an uncomfortable yes / no experience that comes to mind .
An experience that biases our ability to stand in a victim 's shoes .
People judge , and those who suffer remain silent -- for many reasons .
While better laws and more awareness help , some of the most unfortunate trends are maintained by silence .
These things are expected to be unspoken -- and those people who try to tell their stories often suffer real consequences .
But it is only when people speak up that victims are not alone .
Survivors will know then , too .
We can raise awareness and take back the night .
We can make the world safer .
This will allow those who suffer to find a healing path .
We are in a position to improve the odds for women in this regard -- at home and all over the world .
But we first have to learn about violence against women , and how it persists from culture to culture .
A list of links compiled by Nicholas Kristoff et al. at Half The Sky Movement is a great place to start .
While we discuss how domestic violence and sexual assault affect women today , we recognize that men sometimes fall victim to these crimes .
Some of these men get marginalized in an extreme way .
Children are profoundly affected , as well .
Some children suffer most of all -- from direct violence or its secondary effects .
While we use language that speaks to violence against women , we hope to help all of those who suffer from these unfortunate events .

THIS WEEK IN WOMEN'S HISTORY : Happy Birthday , Alice Paul
by joedemocrat
Alice Paul was born on January 11 , 1885 , to Quaker parents William and Tacie Paul in New Jersey .
She attended Quaker schools , which taught and practiced gender equality .
Her mother often took her to suffrage meetings .
In 1907 , she traveled to England and met some of the country 's most militant suffragists , whose forms of protest -- heckling , window smashing , and rock throwing -- were more direct and controversial than the " prayer , petitions , and patience " Alice was used to in America .
She returned to the U.S in 1910 , encouraging her fellow suffragists to follow the English model :
The militant policy is bringing success ... the agitation has brought England out of her lethargy , and women of England are now talking of the time when they will vote , instead of the time when their children would vote , as was the custom a year or two back . "
Alice and Lucy Burns formed the National Woman 's Party .
During one demonstration , she and other suffragists were arrested for " obstructing traffic . "
They were sent to the Occoquan Workhouse , where they went on a hunger strike .
This led to brutal treatment : they were beaten , chained , and put into rat infested cells .
When news of their treatment spread , the public demanded that the suffragists be released , and public sympathy and support for suffrage grew .
In response , President Woodrow Wilson changed his position and announced his support for women 's suffrage .
In 1919 , Congress passed the 19th Amendment and sent it to the states for ratification .
In the summer of 1920 , the deciding vote was cast in Tennessee by Harry Burns who was a " no " vote until receiving a letter from his mother .
In 1923 , Alice Paul wrote the Equal Rights Amendment .
It still has not passed .

WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE
by pat of butter in a sea of grits
On Sunday , Virginia Heffernan discussed telecommuting in the New York Times .
Working from home offers the flexibility to care for children or run needed errands as well as the ability never to have any time that you can't be feeling guilty for not be busy working .
Win-win !
Women , of course , have the same complaints about wired culture that men do : anxiety , insomnia , no escape .
But working from home does mean avoiding the " second shift , " that ’90s horror , in which the workday was said to be followed by a day of housework and child care , somehow all in 24 hours .
With the Internet , work and life have become one long shift .
But is n’t that what middle - class life is meant to be ?
Last week , Arianna Huffington wrote about sleep as a feminist issue , particularly for working women .
She says ( with , admittedly , very little data cited to back it up ) :
The problem is that women often feel that they still do n't " belong " in the boys - club atmosphere that still dominates many workplaces .
So they often attempt to compensate by working harder and longer than the next guy .
Hard work helps women fit in and gain a measure of security .
And because it works , they begin to do more and more and more of it until they can't stop .
But it 's a Pyrrhic victory :
The workaholism leads to lack of sleep , which in turn leads to never being able to do your best .
You can join her sleep challenge and see whether that helps you in your job .

RECOMMENDED READING
by dirkster42
To start off the reading list feature of SheKos , I thought Personal Politics : The Roots of Women 's Liberation in Civil Rights and the New Left by Sara Evans would be a great start .
It 's a very readable narrative of how women developed into feminist activists after bumping up against the limits of sexism in other movements for justice .
It 's always great to have a sense of where you 've come from , and to see which battles have been won , and which one 's we 're still fighting .
Despite the fact that I strongly recommend this book as a starting point , its chief limitation is that it is a narrative that starts of talking about women of all races , but by the end of the narrative it is pretty much the liberation of white women that 's at stake .
To get a more rounded picture of the timeframe and struggles in question , I would say that Personal Politics MUST be read together with at least one of the following books :
Meridian , a novelistic treatment of the time frame of Personal Politics by the African - American novelist Alice Walker .
The inaugural anthology of Black Women 's Studies All the Women are White , All the Blacks are Men , BUT SOME OF US ARE BRAVE , edited by Gloria T. Hull , Patricia Bell Scott , and Barbara Smith .
The overview of Black Women 's religious motivations for Civil Rights work by Rosetta E. Ross , Witnessing and Testifying : Black Women , Religion , and Civil Rights .

GLBT NEWS THE KAT DRAGGED IN : The Parade of Horribles
by KentuckyKat
As I am sure you already know the federal lawsuit challenging Proposition 8 started this week .
Much has been written about the trial and whether it is a wise strategy given the current make - up of the Supreme Court .
I wo n't belabor the point .
I will say , however , that this trial is revolutionary .
It is forcing those who believe that Love and I are less worthy of marriage than opposite - gender couples of legal protections and societal approval to put on evidence in support of that proposition .
Our foes must bring out the parade of horribles that will be caused by same - sex marriage ... but that is not the only or the most important parade of horribles to be shown in this case .
The plaintiffs will get to present the horribles that go along with being a second class citizen .
They can explain the pain of being told that their relationships are not as deserving of marriage as Britney Spears ... or convicted serial killers .
I do n't care about this merely for the ability to vent or for the emotional benefit of telling our truth .
I care because of the correlations that I think will emerge between bans on same sex marriage and the ban on interracial marriages struck down in Loving v. Virginia and Brown v. Board of Education .
Testimony presented Monday dealt with the the emotional toll of separate status .
One plaintiff testified that he and his partner :
" would love to have a family " but have intentionally postponed fatherhood until they can legally wed because they want their children to have the stability and sense of belonging that comes with being raised by married parents .
linky
If you have not followed the case , please check out some of the live blogs of the testimony .
My current favorite is http://prop8trialtracker.com/.
If you would like a more in depth discussion of the case and its progress , please join us at WGLB tomorrow at 11:30 eastern .

EAR ON CULTURE : Sarah Vowell
by earicicle
When I decided to take on the " culture " beat for SheKos , it was a way for me to multitask with my Real Life work as a writer covering the arts .
I research and report on so many fascinating women -- from the past and today -- who have pioneered their fields : literature , music , theater , film and more .
I look forward to sharing their stories with you , and seeking out other tales to tell of amazing women we should all know .
This week , I want to feature the ZOMG - she 's - so - funny - you 're - in - constant - danger - of - peeing - your - pants writer Sarah Vowell .
She 's long been on my " to - read " list .
Maybe you 've also seen her on Letterman or Jon Stewart , or heard her on This American Life , but have n't yet had time to page through one of her books ?
Over the holidays , I finally got to tear into 2008 's The Wordy Shipmates , about the Puritans who founded Boston and Rhode Island .
Vowell is a hilarious comic writer AND an insightful historian .
Her finely - calibrated hypocrisy meter and acerbic modern eye yield many an LOL moment from the misadventures of the super - sober , self - important white men on a mission from God .
But she also has great compassion for their sincerity , and gives them credit when it is due .
For example , Roger Williams -- the fiery religious zealot -- fiercely supported the complete separation of church and state .
In the 1630s !
Women , however , definitely played second fiddle to the men running the 17th century show .
One thing that leapt off the page was Williams ' letter to his wife when she became gravely ill .
Instead of a peppy " get well " card or a tearful missive of concern , Williams penned a preachy , condescending text essentially telling his wife how to get ready to die .
Which he later republished as a pamphlet , Experiments in Spiritual Life and Health ( 1652 ) .
Nice !
But this passage in the book reminded me that I 've come across many more texts over the years specifying how women should behave than I have manuals telling men how to live .
Many more .
Could all the proscriptions and prohibitions imposed on women 's lives have made prescriptive texts a " necessary " cottage industry ?
" Culture " has a much broader definition than the pursuit of the fine arts .
Culture encompasses patterns of belief and behavior : how societies define values and practice them .
And it seems that Keeping a Good Woman Down -- channeling her beliefs , behaviors , values and practices -- has generated a high word count over the years .
I 'd like to look at some of these issues with you here , too .

Computer games have a broad appeal that transcends gender , culture , age and socio-economic status .
Now , computer scientists in the US think that creating computer games , rather than just playing them could boost students ' critical and creative thinking skills as well as broaden their participation in computing .
They discuss details in the current issue of the International Journal of Social and Humanistic Computing .
Nikunj Dalal , Parth Dalal , Subhash Kak , Pavlo Antonenko , and Susan Stansberry of Oklahoma State University , Stillwater , outline a case for using rapid computer game creation as an innovative teaching method that could ultimately help bridge the digital divide between those people lacking computer skills and access and those with them .
" Worldwide , there is increasing recognition of a digital divide , a troubling gap between groups that use information and communication technologies widely and those that do not , " the team explains .
" The digital divide refers not only to unequal access to computing resources between groups of people but also to inequalities in their ability to use information technology fully . "
There are many causes and proposed solutions to bridging this divide , but applying them at the educational and computer literacy level in an entertaining and productive way might be one of the more successful .
The team adds that teaching people how to use off - the - shelf tools to quickly build a computer game might allow anyone to learn new thinking and computing skills .
After all , they explain , the process involves storytelling , developing characters , evaluating plots , and working with digital images and music .
Indeed , their preliminary survey of this approach shows largely positive effects .
Rapid computer game creation ( RCGC ) sidesteps the need for the students , whether schoolchildren or adult learners , to have any prior knowledge of computer programming .
Traditionally , various groups have stereotypically been excluded from computing to some degree , including women , seniors and people who do n't consider themselves as mathematically minded .
Dalal and colleagues suggest that their approach circumvents most of the issues and provides a lead into computing that would otherwise not be apparent .
With RCGC becoming increasingly popular in schools and universities , the team suggests that the next step will be to develop yet more effective teaching models using RCGC and to investigate the conditions under which it works best in improving critical and creative thinking and developing positive attitudes to computing among different groups by gender , age , nationality , culture , ethnic group , and academic background .
A tarot , clairvoyant , or psychic is a person who claims to have a supernormal ability to see events beyond the future or your imagination .
They will do this by reading your palm or looking at a specific crystal ball .
This is usually common with those who are uncertain about their future .
The good thing is that you can now access such online .
I ’ve managed to access psychic reading near me from various online platforms .
What Benefits Do the Services of a Tarot Reader or Clairvoyant Offer ?
There are many reasons why you should get in touch with a professional psychic or tarot reader .
The best services are always praised by those who have counted on them , but the truth is that there is much more than the satisfaction of having answers .
Going to these experts is something that enriches people much more than it seems at first glance .
Here are some of the benefits you are likely to enjoy when you visit a psychic or tarot reader .
Best advice
If a good seer or expert tarot reader has something favorable , she can see what others could never .
This , mainly due to her gift and her ability to channel energies , allows her to predict what is about to happen or to come .
Something for which , precisely , they go to them .
What does this imply ?
Well , it is evident .
There is no better advice than that which can be received from an expert of this type .
And the reason is simple .
Since they can predict events , they can help you face them in the best possible way , or use them to your advantage .
Your message serves as both guidance and advice .
Personal and Spiritual Internalization
When that more than necessary connection between client and tarot reader is established , it is not only when the best communication is achieved , nor is it when everything begins to work as it should .
This special moment is something that drastically reinforces the internalization of the person .
The services of these professionals always lead to meditation , and their advice can sometimes help us pause for a moment and think .
In this way , we can be much more self - critical and reflective , even more capable when handling complicated situations .
Both personal and spiritual internalization is one of the best positive effects that this type of service achieves .
Problem - solving
Of course , the main reason why you go to an expert tarot reader or a great professional clairvoyant is because you are looking for answers .
Answers that are generally linked to problems that require a solution .
Even in that , their services have great benefits .…
Augmented Reality on Gadgets are in Vogue .
They are trendy , is fun to use and give good utility .
After all , it takes virtual life into Real life .
Starting from iPhone 3.1 , lots of Augmented Reality apps have come to iPhone .
So to help you out choosing the right one for you ( most work only on iPhone 3GS ) , we have collected all the best ones here :
1. Layar
Layar is the first AR app to arrive on iPhone and Android platform .
Layar is not a single purpose app — it ’s fed by a growing library of “ layers , ” which range from Wikipedia to Flickr to apartment listings in your local town .
So this multipurpose app does more than any other app does .
The best thing , it ’s free , so it ’s a great way to get things started in AR world .
2. Yelp
Yelp originally intended to be a local recommendations app .
When AR was added , local food search became more intuitive things like “ Where to find Sushi ” , “ Nearest Indian spicy food ” becomes piece of cake .
This one ’s secret — you ’ve got to shake your phone to activate it .
The App is free and awaits your download .
3. UrbanSpoon
UrbanSpoon is a broader version of UrbanSpoon .
The Augmented reality implementation is slick :
With a of your iPhone , you get 2D map mode , and tilt it back up to switch to THE FUTURE .
The App is again , free .
Good things in life come for free . 🙂
4. Wikitude
As the name suggests , the app is based on WikiPedia locations .
The App overlays reality .
It shows text bubbles over the locations of geotagged Wikipedia articles .
What differentiates this from something like Layar is that through the app ’s website , Wikitude .me , you can add your own points of interest .
Most of the data sets used by AR apps are broad and not that useful outside of large cities , so this is a good way to build your own hyperlocal augmented reality .
5. Nearest Subway
Point your camera and it Overlays your camera ’s view with floating , labeled avatars of your nearest subway stations .
This one ’s is right now local to NY , For other cities similar apps are Nearest Tube for London , Bionic Eye for Tokyo , etc .
But it does n’t matter , because the experience of actually using this thing borders on sexual , especially if you ’re used to compass - less Google Maps .
This ai n’t free , though , comes for $ 2 .
6. RobotVision
Like Layar or Wikitude , RobotVision is also a location based point - of - interest app , on the contrary it uses Bing to yield results .
I do n’t know if that is a wise deal .
It ’s a change of pace if you ’re getting tired of browsing through local historical sites with Wikipedia , or watching local Twitterfiends broadcast their locations every eight minutes .
Good for Bing Lovers .
Though company is supposed to add Google too .
7. Assasin FPS :
This is app intended just - for - fun , not much utility here .
It ’s a FPS HUD , gun included , superimposed onto real life .
So , finally , you can shoot your enemies and bosses in the face , or rocket - blast the person standing in front of you .
Shooting them will cost you a Dollar in App Store .
8 . NearesWiki
App that shows you Wikipedia articles about your surroundings .
Made by the same company that made Nearest Places , acrossair , it uses a similar layout and offers the same quality experience .
Comes at $ 2
UPDATE : Thanks Chris , we are adding more to the list :
9. Bionic Eye
Bionic
Eye has grabbed huge attention due to the fact that it works across the US .
It lets you visualize locations such as restaurants , coffee shops , Apple stores , and various tourist locations .
When vertical , it gives you a 360 - degree view of all POI near your location , updated in real time ; when you flip it to horizontal position , you ’ll see a list of all the nearest POI .
The App is barely a dollar , worth every single penny .
10 . WorldSurfer
WorldSurfer app lets you use your iPhone as a compass on steroids while you are out in public .
Just open up the World Surfer app is a compass on Steriods , it finds information about the places you see around you , while you are walking .
e.g. you can point your phone down a street to see if there is anything good to eat in that direction , or point your phone at a building to learn its history , see Flickr pictures or YouTube movies .
Bookmark your car or any favorite place and be guided right back to it .
Look for special offers only when you want them .
This app collaborates most of the tasks done by other apps individually .
As far as pricing is concerned , it wo n’t drill a hole in pocket at $ 2.99
11 . Lodestone AR Campus
Lodestone puts a detailed compass over your view of the world to help you navigate and includes detailed Google Maps to assist in your travels .
Lodestone finds Wikipedia articles from your location and displays them in your camera view at their proper compass direction and elevation .
If you love trekking , you will love this app even more .
Want to know the elevation of that mountain you ’re about to climb ?
Simply tilt your iPhone down to reveal a map , tap to drop a pin and raise the iPhone back up .
You ’ll see the elevation of the pin relative to your current elevation .
( This uses iPhone 3GS Magnetometer ) .
Costs $ 1.99
12 . Pocket Universe
Pocket Universe is out of this planet .
Point your iPhone towards the Stellar sky to display a labelled map of the cosmos matched to wherever it ’s pointed .
It ’s a heavy - duty astronomy news and reference app in addition to the AR feature .
As you are not looking through the camera the data is not viewed as a layer , but at night that would be pretty hard to see anyway .
Like other AR apps , on launch , user ’s location is queried , and then the compass guides your view of the sky ( now this is awesome ) to reveal exactly what can be found at a given time and place .
I guess at price of $ 4 , it ’s justified .
Yes , there are loads of others , but the list is limited to what looks like ‘ good apps ’ today .

' Working twice as hard for half the money '
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Being out of work is taking a toll on job seekers .
But even those with a job are getting fed up .
Layoffs , diminished benefits , pay cuts and extra workload burdens are finally pushing many disgruntled workers right out the door .
In a study by CareerBuilder , 24 % of workers say they no longer feel loyal to their current employer and 19 % plan to move to a new job this year .
Almost one - quarter of respondents surveyed by the Conference Board in a separate study said they did n't expect to be at their current jobs within a year .

Will you be looking for a new job this year ?
Yes , I do n't love my current job .
Yes , I 'm unemployed .
No , I 'm happy where I am . or View results
Since the recession took hold two years ago , only the threat of the unemployment line was keeping workers on the job .
But as the economy shows signs of improvement , " people will start taking off in droves , " said Rusty Rueff , a career and workplace expert at Glassdoor.com .
A flight attendant named Brent hopes to be one of them .
Now 36 , he has seen his pay cut 33 % since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
At the same time , his hours have increased .
" We 're working twice as much than we 're supposed to be working for half the money , " he said of himself and his coworkers .
He has since gone back to school and graduated with an MBA , hoping to find work in arts administration and leave the airlines behind .
Despite his discontent , Brent says he will continue working at the airline until he receives a job offer .
" I really can't afford to quit , it 's a matter of grinning and bearing it until things turn around . "
" Workers feel like they took the brunt of the recession because companies had to do whatever they could to cut costs , and what they cut were programs that directly impacted employees , " explained Michael Erwin , a senior career adviser at CareerBuilder .
Now , with signs of improvement in the economy , employers should start thinking about worker retention , rather than cost cutting .
" Morale is in the toilet , " said Glassdoor 's Rueff .
" Morale issues lead to productivity issues which lead to results issues . "
If employers do not communicate what employees can expect going forward in terms of reinstating salaries and benefits , then that 's going to cause a lot of friction , Rueff explained .
Take this job and shove it ?
Joan Marie Verba , 56 , could n't take another day with her former employer .
" I worked for a nationally advertised weight loss company .
Our pay was basically minimum wage , with commissions for each client , " she said .
" However , ever since the recession started , the number of clients diminished , which meant that the pay essentially was reduced to minimum wage . "
Plus , " they were cutting hours and the opportunities were just shrinking , " she said .
" I was just so frustrated , I had to make a change , " Verba said of her decision to quit in December .
She has since been looking for another job while taking additional classes in health coaching and working as an independent weight loss consultant .
But experts say employees need to keep their emotions in check and think twice about whether to jump ship without a back - up plan .
" It 's going to be even more competitive than it was last year , " Erwin said .
Workers should start thinking about their next move , update their resumes and build up networks .
But quitting on the spot as a form of protest is not advisable considering the alternative of getting lost in a sea of job seekers competing for few openings .
" People who are in jobs need to think long and hard before they jump up and say that the grass is greener on the other side , " Rueff cautioned .
" I do n't think they want to be out there on the street right now . "
Honduran , Member of National Resistance Front , Found Decapitated
The article mentions that when Corrales Garcia was taken into custody on December 5 , the men were wearing the uniform of the DNIC ( National Criminal Investigation Department ) and carrying “ Galil ” rifles — made in Israel .
Honduran Opposition Member Found Decapitated
TEGUCIGALPA .—
The body of Santos Corrales Garcia , a member of the National Resistance Front against the coup d’état in Honduras , was found this weekend decapitated at the hands of the police under the Roberto Micheletti de facto regime ’s command , reported YVKE Mundial news agency .
According to the president of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights , Andres Pavon “ Santos Corrales ’ dead body was found near Talanga , but the head is still missing . ”
The activist underscored that Corrales had been arrested back on December 5 in the Nueva Capital area , in the south of Tegucigalpa , by five people wearing uniforms of the National Criminal Investigation Department , who carried Galil rifles and 9 mm pistols and drove a Tacoma vehicle .
Corrales ’ body showed signs of torture , most likely to make him inform on a supplier who provided opposition members with provisions .
Pavon said Corrales ’ death is another regrettable consequence of the cycle of lethal violence created by the de facto regime with the goal of dismantling the National Resistance Front .
The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien
Conan O'Brien wants to return to the air with another show " as soon as he possibly can " after his non-compete clause with NBC expires in September , his manager told TVGuide.com .
" He 'd like to do another show not dissimilar to what he did , " Gavin Polone said .
" And he'd like to work with the people he 's been working with . "
NBC dumps Conan for $ 45 million payoff ; reinstates Jay as Tonight Show host
O'Brien's $ 45 million exit deal with NBC , which includes a $ 12 million severance for his loyal staff members who moved out with him to Los Angeles last year for The Tonight Show , stipulates that he cannot work elsewhere until Sept.
1 . Fox has already expressed interest in O'Brien , and others networks are putting feelers out as well .
Polone declined to comment on any offers .
Fox network president : " I love Conan "
O'Brien 's last Tonight Show airs Friday .
He will welcome guests Will Ferrell Tom Hanks and musical guest Neil Young .
Ferrell and Hanks were among his first guests in his debut week last June .
A MILITANT Hindu group in Mumbai with a history of political violence says it will not allow Australian cricketers to play in parts of the country until there is an end to attacks on Indians in Australia .
The threat , made by the powerful Shiv Sena political party , casts a shadow over the participation of Australian stars in the rich Indian Premier League , starting in early March .
Bal Thackeray , the firebrand leader of the Shiv Sena ( Army of Lord Shiva ) , made the threat on the front page of the party 's mouthpiece publication , Saamna , yesterday .
'' We will not allow kangaroo cricketers to play in Mumbai … till the attacks are stopped on Indians , '' he wrote .
In colonial America , suspected witches were dumped in vats of water until they drowned or confessed , in which case they were hanged .
Today , we have congressional hearings .
On Wednesday , the accused witch was Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , formerly president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
He survived , but may yet face the political equivalent of a hanging .

A Westminster fortuneteller and her daughter were stabbed to death because a spell did not work , the prosecutor in the case said Thursday .
Suspect Tanya Nelson blamed the fortuneteller , Ha " Jade " Smith , for a love fortune gone bad and was so angered she decided to kill her , said Sonia Balleste of the Orange County district attorney 's office .
A letter found in Nelson 's North Carolina home indicated that Nelson wanted Smith to change the fortune , Balleste said .
Smith wrote in the letter that she could not do that , Balleste added .
Balleste said Nelson was angered by Smith and decided to travel to Orange County to kill her .
Nelson is accused of persuading an accomplice , Phillipe Zamora , to take part in the April 21 , 2005 , killing .
Most of the world 's seven thousand languages will no longer be spoken by the end of this century .
So what ?
Should we moan , resist , or say " Good riddance ! " ?
This post was stimulated by a story in the news magazine The Economist on the extinction of languages .
It notes that 200 African languages have recently died and another 300 are endangered .
In Southeast Asia , another 145 are on the verge of disappearing .
And so forth .
Any loss can seem threatening , and so the knee - jerk reaction to warnings about languages is an urge to conserve them .
The Economist article editorialized liberally , such as by saying the acceleration in the rate of language extinction is " alarming . "
But what 's to be alarmed about ?
The disappearance of a language is not like , say , a local crop failure that augurs starvation .
In other words , if some obscure language ceases to be spoken , it is not as if millions or even dozens of people will be unable to talk .
All it means is that the people who would have spoken that language will speak a different language .
I can readily understand alarm about overfishing and the extinction of various fish species .
The disappearance of varieties of fish is linked to a disappearance of fish , period .
It bespeaks a genuine danger that future generations will not be able to find , see , enjoy , or eat fish .
But there is no danger that we will end up with zero languages .
Let me play devil 's advocate for a moment here .
Maybe we should celebrate the disappearance of obscure languages .
Would n't there be considerable positive value if everyone in the world spoke the same language ?
Imagine how easy it would be to communicate with everyone else .
I am not the only one to see linguistic diversity as more trouble than it 's worth .
As one distinguished precedent for this point of view , the Bible depicts the emergence of multiple languages as a God inflicted on people .
In that story , life was better for all when everyone spoke the same language .
The creation of linguistic diversity was a curse and punishment visited upon us , so that we could not understand each other as well .
Let me comment further on the Economist article , not because it was unusual , but rather because I think it is fairly typical of how the media and the scholarly world have treated the topic .
It seems to assume that the disappearance of languages is a bad thing , though it fails to present much in the way of actual harm that has come .
Indeed , and to the magazine 's credit , the article does acknowledge that " plenty of languages - among them Akkadian , Etruscan , Tangut , and Chibcha - have gone the way of the dodo , without causing much trouble over posterity . "
But then it goes on with the handwringing , alarmist tone .
Toward the end , the article says there are ostensibly " strong arguments " in favor of linguistic diversity .
As examples , there are three .
If these are strong arguments , I do n't know what lame ones would be .
First argument : a claim that multilingual children do better than monolingual ones .
Is this worth spending billions of dollars in a futile effort to keep various obscure tongues alive ?
Even if the data on children are correct - and I can imagine they are confounded by having smarter children or more sophisticated parents - the world only needs 2 or 3 languages , not seven thousand .
In fact , the future I foresee is that there would be two or three world languages , such as English and Chinese ( Mandarin ) , and every child would learn both .
Hence everyone would be multilingual .
Getting rid of the other languages would just facilitate this process .
Second argument : rejects the argument that a common tongue helps to avoid war , citing examples of Rwanda , Bosnia , and Vietnam .
Citing counterexamples is no substitute for statistics .
Have more wars been fought between groups that share a language than between different language groups ?
Besides , even if language is irrelevant to war , so what ?
That 's not the argument for having a common language .
The third argument is even more absurd .
The article notes that an Australian turtle was recently found to have two varieties , and a local language had two different words for the two types .
I do n't see how that is relevant to anything .
It is easy enough to make a new word for the new type of turtle ; one hardly needs a separate language .
The argument that this links preserving languages to " protection of endangered species " is utterly illogical .
There are those who care about language , and I am one of them .
Putting this into practice by preserving near - dead languages on some kind of technologically boosted life support is of dubious value .
Instead , we should work to conserve the effectiveness of language to communicate .
This means respecting grammar , syntax , writing style , and other hallmarks of a strong , useful language , because they contribute to clarity and precision of communication .
It looks like Facebook has finally gotten fed up with all the viruses and spam that is plaguing the social network and ensnaring and embarrassing its 350 million members .
Late Tuesday , the company announced a deal with McAfee , a leading maker of antivirus software , to give Facebook users a complimentary six - month subscription to McAfee ’s Internet Security Suite .
After that , Facebook users will be entitled to discounts on the software .
Under the terms of the partnership , McAfee will become Facebook ’s exclusive provider of consumer security software for one year .
Facebook will also begin using a McAfee tool to scan the computer of any user whose account gets compromised by malware .
( There have been some high - profile examples recently . )
Facebook users whose accounts get hijacked have to go through a remediation process .
As part of that , they will now have to subject their computers to this scan to regain control over their Facebook account .
“ We have seen an absolute huge rise in malware worldwide over the past 12 months , probably more than the previous five years combined , ” said David DeWalt , McAfee ’s chief executive .
“ We are seeing a lot more malware specifically designed and targeted at large social networking applications .
These are just the trends in the industry . ”
Mr. DeWalt said more than half of all Internet users still had no anti-virus software protecting their computers .
Elliot Schrage , Facebook ’s vice president of communications and public policy , said that Facebook has its own technology that aims to keep malware off the site .
But , he said , “ as security continues to be an issue for Facebook and across the Web , we realized that if we really wanted to build a leadership position that defines best practices for helping users have a safe experience , we needed to partner with other industry leaders . ”
Binary blobs in Linux kernel
Introduction
Some Linux kernel drivers include binary blobs , i.e. software that is included without source code , with obfuscated or obscured source code , under non-Free Software licenses , that do not permit you to change the software so that it does what you wish .
Some applications and drivers require firmware to function , and sometimes that firmware is distributed only in object code form , under a nonfree license .
Blobs can take many forms .
Sometimes , they will be provided in separate files .
Other times , they may be incorporated into the source of the driver itself ( for example , it could be encoded as a large array of numbers ) .
Binary blobs can be classified as the following three types , currently found in the Linux kernel :
Sourceless binary blobs with no license , no explicit permission to redistribute , or an explicit prohibition to redistribute .
This category currently includes the emi26 , emi62 , keyspan , smctr , cops , and 3c359 drivers .
Sourceless binary blobs distributed under GPL .
This situation has been interpreted as a violation of the terms of GPL , which requires the distribution to be accompanied by the source code .
Binary blobs violating DFSG for other reasons .
This category includes firmware which contains obfuscated source , or is not allowed to be modified .

In 1932 , progressive Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis penned one of the most famous passages in American jurisprudence .
" It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system , " Brandeis wrote in his dissent in New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann , " that a single courageous State may , if its citizens choose , serve as a laboratory , and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country . "
Since then , Brandeis ' famous words have been quoted or referenced countless times , appearing everywhere from legal ...
A mighty earthquake rocked the small , impoverished island nation of Haiti on Tuesday , collapsing a hospital , the presidential palace and other buildings , triggering massive panic and claiming an as - yet uncounted number of lives -- perhaps thousands .
Screams for help emanated from felled buildings , and chaos reigned .
One diplomat called the quake a “ catastrophe ” in one of the countries least equipped to handle it .
More than 30 aftershocks have been recorded .
The devastating earthquake has left an estimated 3 million people in need of emergency aid , a Red Cross official said today .
The aid organization said Haiti ’s disaster relief teams were “ completely overwhelmed . ”
France ’s foreign minister says the head of the U.N. mission in Haiti appears to have died in the earthquake .
Bernard Kouchner said the French ambassador had visited the devastated U.N. headquarters building in Port - au - Prince and said “ everyone who was in the building is apparently dead ” including Tunisian diplomat Hedi Annabi Annabi .
The U.N. has maintained a peacekeeping force in Haiti since 2004 .
As night fell on the Haitian capital of Port - au - Prince , a city of 2 million , reports emerged of extensive destruction ; homes and buildings a shambles ; trapped , seriously injured victims ; and residents sleeping in streets .
Tsunami alerts were issued for Cuba , the Bahamas and much of the Caribbean , and numerous aftershocks were reported .
The quake , one of the most powerful ever in the region , measured a preliminary magnitude of 7.0 .
It was centered about 10 miles west of Port - au - Prince and was shallow , just five miles deep .
It struck about 4:53 p.m. , hitting one of the city ’s most densely populated areas .
All of that augured vast damage and overwhelming casualties .
Electricity in the capital was out Tuesday night , telephone communications were down , and the airport was closed .
“ We are hearing of sheer devastation , ” said Caryl Stern , president of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF , which has 100 workers in Haiti .
UNICEF employees in Port - au - Prince reported seeing a school collapse with children inside .
“ It ’s horrible , ” Stern said .
“ The worst earthquake in such a poor region .
You are starting from behind the eight ball . ”
Photos emerging from Haiti showed buildings in rubble and houses tumbled down ravines .
Thousands of people gathered in public squares late into the night , singing hymns , the Associated Press reported .
The poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere , Haiti , with a population of about 9 million , shares a border with the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola .
Some residents reportedly felt some shaking in Santo Domingo , the Dominican capital , but no serious damage was reported .
Already battered in recent years by storms , military coups and gang violence , much of Haiti is a hodgepodge of slums , shoddy construction and people living on the edge .
“ I can hear very distressed people . . . a lot of distress , people wailing , trying to find loved ones trapped under the rubble , ” Ian Rodgers , with Save the Children in Port - au - Prince , told CNN by telephone Tuesday evening .
A spokeswoman for Catholic Relief Services said the group ’s representative in Haiti , Karel Zelenka , described “ total disaster and chaos ” before the telephone line went dead .
Zelenka told colleagues that the Haitian capital was covered with dust .
“ He estimates there must be thousands of people dead , ” the spokeswoman , Sara Fajardo , said in an interview from the group ’s office in Maryland .
Fajardo said the group has stockpiles of food and other goods to serve 5,000 families , but aid workers worry that relief efforts could be hampered by poor road conditions and lack of security .
Haiti’s ambassador to the U.S. , Raymond Joseph , said in Washington that he spoke to officials in Port - au - Prince and that President Rene Preval was safe but his regal headquarters was badly damaged .
He quoted a senior Haitian official as saying that “ buildings were crumbling right and left ” near the presidential palace .
“ I think it is really a catastrophe of major proportions , ” Joseph said .
In Washington , President Obama pledged to help the crippled country .
Other countries also announced plans to send assistance .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton described the disaster as catastrophic .
“ The United States is offering our full assistance to Haiti and to others in the region , ” Clinton said from Honolulu .
“ We will be providing both civilian and military disaster relief and humanitarian assistance .
And our prayers are with the people who have suffered , their families , and their loved ones . ”
Philip J. Crowley , the State Department ’s senior spokesman , said U.S. Embassy personnel have reported widespread damage , including collapsed buildings and walls , and bodies in the streets .
The presidential palace , a graceful white French colonial structure visited by President Clinton in 1995 , has sustained heavy damage , Crowley said .
U.S. officials plan to send teams to assess Haiti ’s needs , but they first need to determine whether airport runways are able to receive cargo planes carrying aid , Crowley said .
A spokesman for U.S. Southern Command , which oversees American military operations in the Caribbean and South America , said officials were assessing what assistance or aid might be needed .
“ We are monitoring the situation and staying in close contact with the State Department , ” said Jose Ruiz , a spokesman for the command .
The Associated Press said its reporters saw a hospital collapse in the wealthy suburb of Petionville , which overlooks the capital .
“ Within a minute of the quake . . . soil , dust and smoke rose up over the city , a blanket that completely covered the city and obscured it for about 12 minutes until the atmospheric conditions dissipated the dust , ” Mike Godfrey , who works as a contractor for USAID , told CNN from Port - au - Prince .
People communicating by social media such as Twitter said they felt the quake in Cap - Haitien , in the north , but there was little damage .
Former President Clinton , the U.N. 's special envoy for Haiti , issued a statement saying his office would do whatever it could to help .
Sources said he was likely to be dispatched to the island as one of the Obama administration ’s first gestures .
Nan Buzard of the American Red Cross , who is mobilizing teams to travel to Haiti , said , “ It is very grim . ”

Five Years : James Urbaniak Interview
As the voice of Dr. Thaddeus S. ' Rusty ' Venture , James Urbaniak brings a lot to the table .
Angry , cynical , sarcastic and bitter , it 's a role that is hard to picture any other actor voicing .
That 's not just because you 're used to him either ; James was the first and only choice for the role .
Aside from portraying a jaded super scientist on and off for the last six years ( among other parts on the show ) , James has taken on many roles on both stage and screen ( big and small ) .
He 's had parts in films such as American Splendor and Sweet and Lowdown and had guest roles on shows such as Weeds and The Office and he 's even been on two of the three Law & Orders .
Aside from all that he has been posting his thoughts on his Live Journal for the last four years and has recently gained quite the following on Twitter where he very often responds to and jokes around with fans .
So when I recently asked James if he would n't mind giving a quick interview in support of my Five Years of Mantis - Eye thing , he was gracious enough to say yes .
James Urbaniak ; great guy or greatest guy ?
You be the judge .
Mantis - Eye :
You were Jackson Publick 's first choice for the voice of Dr. Venture , correct ?
Did that still involve an audition of some kind or was it just " okay you 've got the job , you start Wednesday ? "
James Urbaniak :
He offered it to me point blank one night at a bar in New York City .
I wish all jobs came about that way .
Mantis - Eye :
Had you guys worked together on anything before Venture Bros .?
James Urbaniak :
I had n't worked with Jackson or Doc before but a few years earlier I was in a live action sitcom pilot with Patrick Warburton .
It never aired .
Mantis - Eye :
Has anything about how the character has changed over time affected how you play him ?
He seems to be falling into more of a father role this season , at least with Dean .
James Urbaniak :
There are little flashes of emotional nuance and fatherly sensitivity in some later scripts .
You try to honor those .
Mantis - Eye :
What are your favorite things about playing Dr. Venture , and your favorite things about the character in general ?
James Urbaniak :
It 's fun and possibly therapeutic to rant like a lunatic for two hours in the booth .
Mantis - Eye :
The other major character you play is Phantom Limb whose voice is obviously further from your own than Dr. Venture's .
Was there a specific kind of voice requested , or did you come up with the voice ?
James Urbaniak :
Just came up with it based on seeing a drawing and hearing a description of the character .
I was influenced by Ian McKellen 's vocal quality on a video of a production of Macbeth he did in the '70s .
He taffypulls his vowels very luxuriously .
Mantis - Eye :
Is it more difficult to play Phantom Limb or Dr. Venture ?
James Urbaniak :
They both take energy .
Dr. Venture screams in panic more , which is more stressful on the throat .
Mantis - Eye :
You also play David Bowie !
Is that a tough impersonation to do ?
Do you think they 'll ever make you sing ?
James Urbaniak :
I listen to Bowie interviews before we do it .
I do n't know that it 's really a great Bowie impression ; it 's more an essence of Bowie .
One of my characters does sing a little in one of the back eight episodes of Seasons Four .
No spoilers !
Mantis - Eye :
What about the smaller more one - off characters , like that melted scientist guy .
How do those types of parts work ?
Do they just tell you to make a funny voice or is there more specific direction ?
James Urbaniak :
The usual give and take .
I 'll try something but they might have specific area they want me to push it towards .
I do think doing Paul Lynde for a one - off character in the Tag Sale episode was my idea .
Mantis - Eye :
Do you think the show has gotten you more exposure as an actor ?
James Urbaniak :
It 's raised my profile a notch or two but I 'm not aware it 's led directly to other jobs .
But I must say whenever I work on a TV show or film , there 's always someone working on it who 's a huge fan of the show .
I did an episode of The Office and John Krasinski asked me to leave a voicemail as Dr. Venture for a friend of his .
I did and later Krasinski showed me a text he got from the guy that said " NO FUCKING WAY !!! "
Mantis - Eye :
So you 've had your livejournal for like four years now , how has that been going ?
Has it ever affected your work in any way ?
James Urbaniak :
The LJ fell off for a while but I 've tried to keep up with it recently .
I 've sort of switched operations to Twitter .
Some LJ posts have been linked at some mainstreamy outlets so I guess that reinforced my presence here and there .
Mantis - Eye :
Yeah your Twitter is really enjoyable .
Have you considered starting a fan club ?
You 've got what I guess would be considered a cult following , do you enjoy having that kind of status ?
James Urbaniak :
I have not considered starting a fan club but I do appreciate the appreciation .
I always enjoy meeting anyone who 's a fan of the show .
Once a clerk at a drugstore asked me where I got my Venture Brothers hoodie .
Mantis - Eye :
You also seem to be pretty friendly with fans of the show , which is awesome .
It 's great to think you can stop by the web site of one of the major voice actors on the show and post comments and he 'll actually respond to them .
Or , for example , you could ask him to do an interview .
That 's probably had a pretty positive effect on the show and how fans see you guys , do you think ?
James Urbaniak :
I think .
[ed : Sorry for asking a question without an answer there , not sure what I was thinking ]
Mantis - Eye :
Ever get recognized on the street by Venture Bros. fans ?
Do they request that you ' do Dr. Venture ' or anything ?
James Urbaniak :
I was at the zoo once talking to my young son in front of the gorillas .
A guy came up to me and said , " Excuse me , are you James Urbaniak ?
I 'm a huge fan of the Venture Brothers ! "
And I thought , my God , do I sound like Dr. Venture when I'm TALKING TO MY OWN SON ?
A handful of times I have left voicemails for people in character like I did for John Krasinki 's friend .
Mantis - Eye :
I 'm not famous at all so I have no idea how this works , but is it hard to come up with a voice mail message on demand ?
Do you mind that sort of minor loss of privacy when you 're out in public ?
James Urbaniak :
I usually just blurt out " Have a scientastic day ! "
It 's not a big deal .
Mantis - Eye :
Has anyone famous ever asked you about the show ?
I know you worked with Al Pacino recently , he 's a big fan , right ?
James Urbaniak :
You should hear Pacino 's Monarch .
Actually , the makeup woman on that movie was a MAJOR fan of the show .
She told me she was more starstruck meeting me than Al Pacino .
I enjoyed hearing that .
Mantis - Eye :
Outside of the Venture Bros ( which I can only assume is the best ever ) , what 's been your favorite role or favorite project ?
James Urbaniak :
My work with the indie director Hal Hartley is way up there .
I recommend his movie " Henry Fool " for those who may not have seen it .
I play a weird , repressed garbageman poet .
[ ed : check out Henry Fool on IMDB ]
Mantis - Eye :
Have you ever been involved with a project where you just kind of know it 's not well written ?
You do n't have to name anything specific , but what do you do in those cases ?
James Urbaniak :
You try to act as best you can .
That becomes its own challenge and can be weirdly rewarding .
Mantis - Eye :
Did you get to meet David Caruso when you were on CSI : Miami ( I confess I have n't seen that episode ) ?
I do n't have any reason for asking really , I just wanted to know .
James Urbaniak :
Meet him ?
My scenes were WITH HIM .
He was great .
My only regret is he did n't do the sunglasses rip .
Mantis - Eye :
Anything you 've got coming out soon ( or that you 're working on ) to look forward to ?
James Urbaniak :
I 'm in a movie called " Drones " that 's premiering in the main competition at Slamdance next month .
It 's a sort of sci - fi office comedy directed by a couple of actors who were on Buffy and featuring some people from Freaks and Geeks among other things .
And I 'm in an HBO biopic about Jack Kevorkian starring Al Pacino that comes out in the spring .
Yes , Rusty and Scarface have scenes together .
[ed : here 's Drones on IMDB and you can find more info about Slamdance at their website ]
Many , many thanks to James for putting up with me badgering him about this .
He was super receptive and did n't complain about my terrible questions even once .
The reasons for the lower rates of civic involvement , Professor McAdam said , include not only exhaustion and burnout , but also disillusionment with Teach for America ’s approach to the issue of educational inequity , among other factors .

The study , “ Assessing the Long - Term Effects of Youth Service : The Puzzling Case of Teach for America , ” is the first of its kind to explore what happens to participants after they leave the program .
It was done at the suggestion of Wendy Kopp , Teach for America ’s founder and president , who disagrees with the findings .
Ms. Kopp had read an earlier study by Professor McAdam that found that participants in Freedom Summer  the 10 weeks in 1964 when civil rights advocates , many of them college students , went to Mississippi to register black voters  had become more politically active .
“ There ’s been a very clear and somewhat naïve consensus among educators , policy folks and scholars that youth activism invariably has these kinds of effects , ” Professor McAdam said .
“ But we ’ve got to be much more attentive to differences across these experiences , and not simply assume that if you give a kid some youth service experience it will change them . ”
Teach for America is nearing its 20th anniversary .
Of its 17,000 alumni , 63 percent remain in the field of education and 31 percent remain in the classroom .
( This reporter took part in the program from 2003 to 2005 . )
Financed by the William T. Grant Foundation , the study surveyed every person who was accepted by Teach for America from 1993 to 1998 .
It is being published this month in Social Forces , a journal published by the University of North Carolina .
Watch more of Nic Robertson 's interview with Defne Bayrak on CNNI 's " Amanpour . "
Istanbul , Turkey ( CNN ) --
When Defne Bayrak arrives there is no mistaking she is the woman we have come to meet .
Despite the cold she is composed and ready for the interview we agreed .
She is ready to talk about the suicide bombing carried out by her double - agent husband just days earlier , an attack that left seven CIA operatives dead in Afghanistan .
She still wears their wedding ring , a wide band of sparkling engraved gold .
Her face is framed in a tightly - wrapped black scarf , she is slightly taller than average , thin but not painfully so and looks younger than her 31 years .
Her older sister is at her side to watch over her .
As we sit together on a park bench next to the Ula mosque pigeons flutter low over our heads , disturbed from the scattered grain on the cobbled yard as the faithful braved the chill hurrying to and from prayer .
Nearby there is an outdoor market , traders hawking woolens and warm jackets stamp to keep warm at the roadside .
She wants to meet here close to her home in this comfortable suburb on the west of Istanbul .
We 'd tried to persuade her she'd be more comfortable indoors , out of the cold , away from inquisitive crowds but she 'd told her family it must be outside .
To meet an unknown man indoors would be inappropriate .
Her sister worries Defne will say something provocative and get herself in to trouble .
Like most
Turks they are not a radical Islamist family .
Defne was the exception .
Early photographs suggest an easygoing young woman , her hair uncovered , a ready smile on her face .
This was not the woman I was meeting now .
A devout Muslim dressed from head to foot in black , she looked every inch the widow .
Her fine , pale features had turned even paler in the biting cold .
She told me how she and Humam al Balawi met at university in Istanbul , how he won her over in four short months of courtship .
" Was it love at first sight ? " I asked .
Her quiet reply : " We should skip these subjects . "
She was establishing ground - rules .
There were to be no intimate insights , whatever anguish she felt would be well - guarded .
She explained that when they met she was just beginning to follow a stricter interpretation of Islam ; she had begun wearing a headscarf and was drawn to the young medical student 's strong religious views .
He guided her zeal for a more fundamentalist form of her faith .
Moving to Jordan as he completed his medical studies they were happiest when he went to work in a Palestinian refugee camp on the outskirts of the capital , Amman .
His hours were short .
" He would go at 7 a.m. and come home at 2 p.m .
He was comfortable .
His salary was also good .
He was happy . "
But there was a growing conflict within her husband .
The blogs he was writing were some of the best respected among jihadists .
He wanted to join the fight but instead wrote of his anger .
Read CNN 's Afghanistan blog
Soon their first child was born .
They were in tune with one another , she was writing books in praise of Osama bin Laden .
" We were sharing our views with each other , " she explains .
Both were angered by the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
He had even volunteered to go fight in Iraq with jihadist groups but was turned down .
" He met them privately himself and did n't tell me names but these people he met only asked him to collect money and he felt sad . "
Their happy co-existence ended when he stopped hiding his online address .
Arrested by Jordanian intelligence he was questioned for three days .
It changed him .
" He became more religious , " she told me .
" He started memorizing the Quran again . "
She is reliving his life , reaching the moment he left her for Pakistan never to return -- but I see no emotion in her face .
I sense she wants to defend him .
Defne Bayrak denies knowing what her husband was doing but admits she covered his tracks by telling his family he was in Turkey when in truth she knew he was in Pakistan .
" So you helped trick the family ? " I ask .
" Yes , certainly , " came her straightforward answer .
Even when we talk about her two young children she shows little emotion .
She admits though her new burden is hard .
" We as a family ; I am , as a mother and a wife , of course I am sad .
I would have definitely wanted my husband to be with us . "
There are occasional smiles , glimpses of the woman that might have been .
Her sister frets close by , they are bonded by a family 's unquestioning love .
A crowd has gathered , including several plainclothes policeman -- one even openly videoing our interview .
But Bayrak seems unperturbed as she praises her husband 's suicide bombing .
" I was really proud of my husband because we were both truly against the American invasion .
I believe that he realized a very important operation in this way .
And , God willing , I say he is a martyr . "
And the question I most want to ask .
What of the mother - of - three CIA operative who was killed in her husband 's attack , what of her children ?
I thought perhaps one mother might feel for another 's family .
Not so .
She told me : " For what purpose is CIA in the Afghan territories ?
Why did they invade our lands ?
I believe she should n't have gone there .
It 's her fault . "
" Do you have any remorse ? " I asked .
" I do n't feel any remorse .
I do n't see any situation to feel remorse about .
They came to invade our countries , to kill our brothers who are fighting against them , " she replied .
It seemed our discussion had gone about as far as it could .
She 'd braved the cold to defend her husband .
Even if she had not known his intentions when he went to Pakistan , she was probably in a better position than anyone else to predict its outcome .

10 . Saudi Arabia opened its first coeducational college campus , the King Abdullah Science and Technology University .
In a country where the sexes have been so separated in public that some have spoken of ‘ gender Apartheid , ’ this move , which came from King Abdullah , provoked raging controversy .
When a prominent cleric criticized having male and female students on the same campus and the teaching of modern scientific theories like Darwinism , the king summarily fired his ass .
It may seem a small thing , but many big social processes start small .
Most Americans forget that Princeton U. did not become coed until 1969 .
9. Qatar is on track to average 7.5 percent per annum growth for the next few years .
The natural gas giant is a cauldron of development activity .
It permits Aljazeera satellite news to remain the most open and controversial media outlet in the Arab world .
It is expanding the ‘ Education City ’ complex , in which many American universities maintain campuses , and which serves as a key educational hub for the Gulf and its region .
( This robust expansion contrasts with the difficult times higher education is facing in Dubai ) .
8. A Pew Forum on Religion and Life poll finds that American Muslims are unusual in the degree to which they are integrated into mainstream American society and demonstrate moderate attitudes , condemning religious extremism and violence .
They differ siegnificantly from the profile of Muslims in the UK and Germany , e.g , in these regards .
( Muslims in the US are generally from higher class origins and are better educated and wealthier than is typically the case with European Muslims ) .
7 . The information revolution is making strides in the Arab world .
A University of Maryland Poll finds that “ the use of the internet continued to grow , with 36 % stating that they use the internet at least several times a week and only 38 % stating that they never use the internet ( compared with 52 % in 2008 ) .
6. Albania has averaged 10 percent a year growth for each of the last four years , and was the fastest - growing economy in Europe in 2009 .
It held elections in 2009 , and although they were imperfect , an EU report described them [ pdf ] “ as meeting most OSCE commitments , ” despite flaws .
The European Union seems to be giving the country a nod in its application to join the EU .
Albania has an especially aggressive government policy toward implementing alternative energy and wants to be the first green country in Europe .
It depends heavily on thermal and hydroelectric plants ( perhaps too heavily ) .
Brussels concluded this year , “ The government took measures towards the development of the sector by issuing licences for the construction of seven wind farms with a total installed capacity of about 1360 MW and one 140 MW biomass thermal power station . ”
Albania , a country of 3.2 million , is 70 - 80 % of Muslim heritage , but a majority of the country is non-religious .
That is , these European Muslims are more secular than German , Spanish , Italian , Greek and Polish Christians .
5 . The small Gulf oil monarchy of Kuwait took steps toward greater democracy and rule of law .
Women were given the vote in 2005 , and in the May parliamentary elections , 4 women were for the first time elected to the 50 - seat parliament , and fundamentalists only gained 16 seats , down from 24 previously .
As Greg Gause points out , in December parliament was allowed to go forward with a vote of no -confidence in the prime minister , which he survived .
What is significant is that he is from the ruling Al - Sabah family and it had previously not been considered dignified to subject a high official from the family to such a vote .
4. Indonesia , the most populous Muslim country in the world at about 230 mn. , had successful parliamentary elections in 2009 , further consolidating the country ’s decade - old democracy .
Secular parties did better this year , and support for Muslim fundamentalism dropped , both in the voting both and in opinion polls .
President Barack Obama ’s enormous popularity in the country is credited by some observers for a sharp decline in approval of Muslim militancy .
Indonesia has become the world ’s 19th largest economy , and it , Saudi Arabia and Turkey are the three Muslim - majority states in the G20 .
3 . Turkey , which averaged 5.8 percent a year economic growth between 2002 and 2008 , was slowed but not devastated by the world ’s financial crisis .
In these 6 years it has moved from being the world ’s 26th largest economy to being the 17th largest .
It is on track to be the second fastest - growing economy in 2010 , after South Korea , according to OECD projections .
The democratically elected Justice and Development Party government continued to govern with considerable popularity .
Despite severe tensions between Ankara and the Kurdish minority in the southeast , the ruling party took the bold step of pushing for more Kurdish rights .
2. Stability returned to Lebanon .
Successful parliamentary elections , untainted by Syrian interference , were held in June , and a national unity government was formed in November after a lengthy negotiating process .
The Lebanese army intervened forcefully and in a timely fashion to nip potential sectarian flare - ups in the bud .
The 13,000 UN troops patrolling the south helped back the Lebanese army , and despite tensions with Israel on the part both of Palestinian militants and the Shiite Hizbullah militia , there was no significant clash on the southern border .
Prime Minister Saad Hariri recently visited Damascus , building on earlier diplomacy by Maronite Catholic president Michel Suleiman , a former general , and reducing regional tensions .
Lebanon is probably now about 70 % Muslim if the children are counted .
The year 2009 saw the return of musical and cultural festivals and the country of 4 million attracted 2 million tourists , the best year ever .
Lebanon ’s banking and real estate sectors were slowed but by no means devastated by the global financial crisis , since they had adopted conservative investment policies as a result of bad experiences during the years of instability in the last quarter of the twentieth century .
The country was on track to grow 6 percent in 2009 , down from 8.5 percent in 2008 .
The brutal Israeli assault on Lebanon ’s economic infrastructure of summer , 2006 , set the country back three decades , and it will take time fully to recover .
But despite fragility and a few clashes and small bombings , it is fair to say that at the moment , your biggest problem in Beirut is that you ca n’t get a timely reservation at the better restaurants .
1 . A considerable proportion of the Iranian public resorted to concerted street and cultural protests against the stealing of the June presidential election by incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Crowds demanded popular sovereignty and democracy and condemned dictatorship .
Among the largest demonstrations were held just last Sunday .
It is the greatest political awakening in Iran for 30 years .
( Well , OK , you heard about this one , but not as much last weekend as it deserved ; the corporate media go on vacation from news at awkward times . )

Christmas is over and I feel several vent ’s coming on again .
After climategate , it ’s impossible to read some of the junk being done by these fake scientists and not want to punch someone .
I ’m completely uninterested in taxation and ignorant socialist government .
The health care lies going on in congress still have a 40 % support level .
There are still people who want cap and trade , and ca n’t take time to understand what ’s going on .
Why are people so head in the sand ignorant ?
Anyway , instead of subjecting you poor victims to a proper vent , these links were sent to me by email from L. Gardy LaRoche on a presentation by Burt Rutan .
It ’s a good presentation for those who are concerned about global warming by an individual who knows how to read data .
Mr. Rutan shows he ’s done his homework and basically rails against the manipulation of data , false conclusions and takes several shots against consensus argument ( one of my favorites 😉 )
If you have n’t seen the climate data yourself , it ’s not the overwhelmingly convincing data you would expect .
SAN FRANCISCO — Molten lava has been observed creating new seafloor for the first time by a robotic rover exploring the deepest erupting volcano yet discovered .
In high - definition video released Thursday here at the American Geophysical Union meeting , lava bubbles explode as the eruption ’s deep rumble fills the bass end of the spectrum .
“ We thought we could just show the video over and over and not say anything , ” joked oceanographer John Resing of the University of Washington , who led the expedition .
But the new video is more than just spectacular to look at , it also provides scientists with their first look at the geological process that creates the seafloor .
“ On our very own home planet , we have n’t seen lava flowing on the seafloor , ” said Resing .
“ We have n’t seen new ocean crust being made . ”
And now they have .
The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency had been sponsoring submarine volcano research for more than two decades without ever observing lava on the seafloor .
“ This is historic , ” Resing said .
The new footage was captured in May about 4,000 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean near Samoa , at an underwater volcano called West Mata .
Scientists on a University of Washington research vessel gathered around monitors to watch the Jason remotely operated submarine as it approached the volcano .
As the sub neared the summit , warm water , which shimmers like a highway on a hot day , began to stream out of the rocks .
“ We turned and saw this willowy , wispy white smoke - like fluid coming up off the side of the steep volcano .
We knew we were at the right site , ” said Bob Embley , a marine geologist with NOAA who co-led the expedition .
“ Then it was up to the pilot to very skillfully maneuver down to the site then turn to look at it .
When we turned around , we started to see the red flashes of light , and we knew we were seeing the primordial eruption on the sea floor that we ’d never seen before . ”
They named the spot Hades .
And now , you can see what they saw in the videos posted here .
( Editor ’s tip : put on your headphones and turn up the bass . )
The discovery came in part because of NOAA ’s effort to do more ocean exploration to simply find out more about the vast , largely mysterious oceans that cover 70 percent of the Earth .
“ When we go exploring , we make discoveries , ” said Steve Hammond , chief scientist at NOAA ’s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research .
In fact , West Mata is the second underwater volcano discovered by NOAA , in conjunction with the National Science Foundation .
The previous one was discovered in much shallower water in the Mariana Arc .

Thom Hartmann debates Dinesh D'Souza about whether we had followed Jimmy Carter 's proposed energy policy to get us off of foreign oil in 1977 we'd be in the mess we 're in now almost 33 years later .
He does actually get D'Souza to admit that we would not be in the Middle East were it not for our dependence on that oil
Thom wrote about this back in 2005 .
Carter Tried To Stop Bush 's Energy Disasters - 28 Years Ago :
In his recent news conference , George Bush Jr. suggested that our nation 's " problem " with high gasoline prices was caused by the lack of a national energy policy , and tried to blame it all on Bill Clinton .
First , Junior said , " This is a problem that 's been a long time in coming .
We have n't had an energy policy in this country . "
This was followed by , " That 's exactly what I 've been saying to the American people -- 10 years ago if we'd had an energy strategy , we would be able to diversify away from foreign dependence .
And -- but we have n't done that .
And now we find ourselves in the fix we 're in . "
As is so often the case , Bush was lying .
Consider President Jimmy Carter 's April 18 , 1977 speech .
Since it was given nearly three decades ago , when many of the reporters in Bush 's White House were children , it 's understandable that they do n't remember it .
But it 's inexcusable that Bush and the mainstream media ( which , after all , has the ability to do research ) would completely ignore it .
It was the speech that established the strategic petroleum reserve , birthed the modern solar power industry , led to the insulation of millions of American homes , and established America 's first national energy policy .
" With the exception of preventing war , " said Jimmy Carter , a man of peace , " this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes . "
He added : " It is a problem we will not solve in the next few years , and it is likely to get progressively worse through the rest of this century .
" We must not be selfish or timid if we hope to have a decent world for our children and grandchildren .
Continue reading ...
I love that Hartmann makes these debates with conservatives a daily feature on his radio show .
If they 'd let Thom anywhere near our television screen and the cable news shows , they would have their collective IQ raised quite a few points immediately , but that 's not going to happen any time soon .
Here 's a tidbit on Dinesh D'Souza I 'd never read before if his Wiki page is accurate :

Golf putting is both an ART and a SCIENCE .
The ART of golf putting requires a visualization or proper “ read ’ of the slope and grain of the green and a feel for the distance of the putt .
The type of golf putter you choose depends on which type works best for you and which fits your physical framework .
There are many important things to consider when you are choosing a golf putter .
One of the things to consider is face balancing .
You can choose between two types of putters , either those that are face balanced or those that are toe balanced .
The face balanced putters are those that have their face pointed upwards when you balance the shaft .
Toe - balanced putters are those that have a toe pointed toward the ground when it is balanced on the shaft using your finger .
Main points to approach to buying a new golf putter :
• Decide on price / quality
• Pick a putter type
• Choose loft – an iron or a wood
• Select an alignment system –
• Choose a putter head style
• Decide on face inserts
• Decide on shaft offset
• Decide on grip and weight
About Golf Balls :
The three different types of golf balls are there .
Two – piece ball , three – piece ball and high performance balls .
For beginners , two - piece golf balls are more advisable as they are cheaper to comparison of other golf balls .
If someone wants to improve the distance shots he or she needs to two – piece balls .
They more effective and cheaper for long distance shots .
If some one thinks about accuracy in the game then he or she has to select three – piece golf balls or high performance golf balls .
They are more accurate than other golf balls .

" Security here is in a fluid situation , " he said .
" If the Haitian government asked us to provide security downtown , we would do that . "
He played down the threat of violence , saying : " What we 're seeing is that there are isolated incidents of violence and some pockets where it 's been more restive , but overall it 's calm . "
VIDEO : Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger hits out at Ryan Shawcross ' horror tackle '
Furious Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger went on the warpath against England new boy Ryan Shawcross after his ' horrendous ' tackle ended the season of Gunners ' teenage midfielder Aaron Ramsey .
Centre - half Shawcross was sent off in tears during Stoke City ’s 3 - 1 defeat after he left Ramsey with a bad compound fracture which left his leg dangling at a sickening angle reminiscent of Eduardo ’s infamous double leg break at Birmingham City two years ago .
Horror : Arsenal 's Aaron Ramsey ( C ) reacts after breaking his leg during their English Premier League soccer match against Stoke City in Stoke
As Ramsey was being rushed to a London hospital last night to see if he needed emergency surgery , Shawcross was being called up by England manager Fabio Capello for the first time ahead of Wednesday ’s friendly against Egypt , although the Italian had to check he was in the right frame of mind after the incident .
An incensed and upset Wenger confirmed : ‘ Ramsey has a bad fracture .
He will be out for a long time . ’
He accused Arsenal ’s opponents of trying to kick his team out of matches and called on the Football Association and referees to provide more protection .
VIDEO : WENGER'S FURY OVER RAMSEY INJURY
Wenger said : ‘ The tackle from Shawcross was horrendous .
Spare me how nice he is .
Did you see where the injury is ?
It is not acceptable that we lost three players to bad tackles – Abou Diaby , Eduardo and now Ramsey .
To lose a player of quality at 19 like Ramsey is hard to accept .
That is not football for me and I refuse to live with it .
The FA have to act . ’
Concern : Stoke City 's Glenn Whelan ( centre ) waves for urgent medical attention as Arsenal 's Aaron Ramsey lies injured
Shawcross , 22 , appeared to catch Ramsey just above the right ankle and players close by reacted with horror as the bone pushed out of the skin .
Live television refused to show replays of the incident because of the after - effect .
Wenger called on the authorities to hit Shawcross with a long ban , arguing : ‘ It was not a tackle you could call committed .
A three - match ban is ridiculous .
‘ We play football and for someone of Ramsey ’s talent to be kicked out the game is beyond words . ’
Distraught : Arsenal players show their concern as Aaron Ramsey lies seriously injured
Stoke manager Tony Pulis defended the former Manchester United reserve ’s character and said : ‘ It was a bad challenge in respect of the way Ryan caught him .
' But I know Shawcross , he has no bad blood in him whatsoever .
It is a desperately sad day for football , for Aaron and for Arsenal .
I accept that .’

Music therapy can assist in the speech acquisition process in toddlers who have undergone cochlear implantation , as revealed in a new study by Dr. Dikla Kerem of the University of Haifa .
The study was carried out in Israel as a doctoral thesis for Aalborg University in Denmark ( supervised by Prof. Tony Wigram ) and presented at a " Brain , Therapy and Crafts " conference at the University of Haifa .
Some infants who are born with impaired hearing and who cannot benefit from hearing aids are likely to gain 90 % normal hearing ability by undergoing a cochlear implantation procedure .
Following the operation , however , the child -- who never heard before -- undergoes a long rehabilitation process before he or she can begin to speak .
In the present study , Dr. Kerem examined the particular effects that music therapy has on the potential development of toddlers ( aged 2 - 3 years ) who have undergone cochlear implantation , specifically in terms of improving spontaneous communication .
" Music comprises various elements that are also components of language and therefore as a non-verbal form of communication is suitable for communication with these children , when they are still unable to use language .
Communicative interactions , especially those initiated by the toddlers , are critical in the development of normal communication , as they are prerequisites for developing and acquiring language , " explains Dr. Kerem .
She adds that the toddlers undergoing rehabilitation are under much pressure from their surroundings -- especially the parents -- to begin talking , and sometimes this pressure makes them become introverted .
As such , music therapy lends itself to strengthening these children 's nonverbal communication and thereby lessens the pressure on them for verbal exchange and response .
The study provided sixteen sessions for children after cochlear implantation .
Eight of the sessions included music - related activities ( such as games with percussion instruments , vocal games and listening to simple songs ) and the rest involved playing with toys / games without musical sounds .
Each of the sessions was videotaped and then analyzed .
The results showed that during those sessions when music therapy was implemented , spontaneous communication was markedly more frequent and prolonged in the children .
Derived from the results is the fact that the exposure to music needs to be gradual , through the use of music experiences that involve basic musical parameters ( such as intensity and rhythm ) .
" Music can constitute the bridge between the quiet world that the child knew and the new world of sounds that has been unfolded following the operation .
It is also important that the parents and staff learn the best way to expose these children to music , the use of music for communication and the importance of the therapist 's undirected approach ( which enhanced the children 's communication in music therapy and in play to a greater degree than in the directed one ) .
Music therapy is gradually penetrating the field of rehabilitation , but there is still a lot of work to be done in improving awareness of this important area , " Dr. Kerem explains .
Three members of a civilian patrol that enforces Islam ’s strict Sharia law in Indonesia ’s Aceh province have been accused of gang - raping a 20 - year - old university student , authorities there said .
The attack allegedly occurred this month at a small - town police station after the patrol members , known here as the Sharia police , took the woman into custody .
Two men , ages 27 and 29 , were arrested and one is still being sought , authorities said .
Activists say the accusation seriously undermines the credibility of the controversial Sharia police patrols .
“ They do n’t have the authority to detain people -- their role is to give moral advice , that ’s it , ” said Norma Manalu , director of Aceh ’s human rights coalition .
“ They misused their power . ”
Aceh ’s “ vice and virtue patrol ” enforces religious codes across the only province in the nation to employ Sharia , or Islamic law , for its criminal code .
Indonesia is the world ’s most populous Muslim country .
Sharia was introduced in 2002 after the region was granted autonomy as part of efforts to end a decades - long guerrilla war .
Supervisors say the Sharia police , formed three years later , consider themselves the community ’s public conscience .
In September , Aceh ’s provincial parliament passed a law saying that people who commit adultery can be sentenced to death by stoning .
The measure , which still must be approved by the governor , has outraged human rights groups here , which say it will be used to unfairly target women .
The Sharia policemen allegedly stopped a couple by the road near a plantation .
In an interview , the victim ’s father said his daughter ’s friend was beaten by the group and the couple was then brought to a nearby Sharia police station .
The men later returned while off duty and raped the woman , investigators say .
“ She was treated like an animal .
They suffocated and raped her -- it was inhumane , ” the victim ’s father said .
“ She ’s in deep trauma . ”
Marzuki Abdullah , head of the 1,500 - member Sharia police force , said the case was not linked to the patrols because any crime the officers might have committed was done while they were off duty .
Activists say the case should bring a review of the patrols .
“ It ’s time for the Sharia police to introspect their institution , role and officers , ” said Manalu .
“ Are they really needed to judge our morality ?
We do n’t have any guarantees that they have a higher moral standard than us . ”

Anjani is a special correspondent .
The cool , cerebral White House might logically conclude that Wednesday ’s decidedly uncool , uncerebral “ tea bag ” protests were intellectually and politically incoherent , and therefore not worth a second thought .
That would be a dangerous mistake .
The made - for - television demonstrations in cities across the country were generally small , and the only thing they proved conclusively is that — you might want to sit down to hear this — some Americans do n’t much enjoy paying taxes .
What the rallies suggested , however , is that opposition to the Obama administration is coalescing into what I would call a Howard Beale Faction , in honor of the choleric anchorman in the movie “ Network ” whose signature line now seems to have been elevated into philosophy : “ I ’m as mad as hell , and I ’m not going to take this anymore ! ”
Not going to take what anymore ?
Well , whatever .
The occasion was Tax Day , April 15 , and clearly there was a lot of anger about taxes .
That ca n’t have been the only source of ire , however , since President Obama ’s policies mean that the vast majority of Americans will be paying less in income taxes , not more .
In terms of logical self - interest , only the wealthy should have come out to dump their tea bags and wave their pitchforks .
There was anger at hemorrhagic government spending , and this plotline in the mad - as - hell narrative at least made sense .
A neutral observer might point out that the president who should have to answer for this year ’s astronomical $ 1.7 trillion deficit is George W. Bush , since this is his budget — and since he ’s the one who hid the costs of our two faraway wars and demanded a king ’s ransom to bail out the banks .
But it ’s not as if Barack Obama is some kind of tightwad , given his decision — which I support — to push ahead with new spending on health care , education and energy .
And anyway , in the worldview of the Howard Beale Faction , the important distinction is n’t between one president and the next .
It ’s between “ us ” and “ them . ”
Some protesters were mad about measures they feared Obama and the Democratic majorities in Congress might take to strengthen gun control laws .
Some were mad about illegal immigration , some about abortion , some about gay marriage .
At times , the protests ventured into fantasyland .
Texas Gov. Rick Perry , caught up in the excitement of the day , prattled nonsensically about Texas ’ one - time status as an independent country and how , purportedly , the state had reserved the right to secede .
The protests were all over the map , and thus hard to take seriously .
A reality check would show that Obama ’s approval rating is running higher than 60 percent in most recent polls .
Surveys indicate that Americans blame Wall Street and the Bush administration for the woeful state of the economy .
Generally speaking , the polls show , most Americans are willing to go along with the president ’s agenda , at least for now , and realize it will take time to begin seeing results .
But the polls also point to what looks like a reservoir of simmering discontent .
For example , according to a CBS - New York Times survey released last week , 47 percent of respondents were willing to believe that the Obama administration ’s bailout assistance to the banks would ultimately benefit all Americans , as opposed to 40 percent who believed the money would just benefit the banks .
But in that same poll , 58 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the administration ’s plans to provide financial aid to the banks .
In other words : Maybe this is necessary , but we do n’t like it .
Among self - described independent voters , 68 percent disapproved of how the administration was bailing out the banks .
I dwell on this one question buried deep inside one poll because I think it contains a quiet warning — the same message that could be discerned amid the random noise of the Howard Beale shoutfests .
When the economy begins to rebound , Wall Street will come back first — already , we ’re seeing some big banks , still bloated with taxpayer funds , reporting healthy profits .
After recovery begins , unemployment will almost certainly continue to rise for months until it hits its peak .
The mad - as - hell faction may thrive and multiply .
A growing sense of us versus them , of the little guy versus the big guy , is out there waiting to be exploited by anyone clever enough to fashion a sophisticated populist critique of the Obama administration ’s policies .
I know it seems crazy to use words like clever and sophisticated in connection with today ’s Republican Party , but stranger things have happened .
Eugene Robinson ’s e-mail address is eugenerobinson ( at) washpost.com .
Credit where credit is due :
Cindy McCain , the wife of 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain , has posed for an ad endorsing pro-gay marriage forces in California .
Her husband responded by having his staff issue a statement .
Senator McCain respects the views of members of his family .
The Senator chaired the effort to successfully pass Arizona Proposition 102 , the Marriage Protection Amendment , and his opposition to gay marriage remains the same .
Senator McCain believes the sanctity of marriage is only defined as between one man and one woman .
The first Mrs. McCain was unavailable for comment .

The medical establishment is about to get a dose of web 2.0 - style medicine in the form of a crowdsourced , socially networked contest that opens the fight against Type 1 diabetes to the public at large – and to Harvard 's medical research departments – using InnoCentive 's online challenge platform for competition and collaboration .
The stakes are high , not only for the sufferers of Type 1 diabetes who stand to benefit from the leaps in research Harvard hopes the program will generate , but also for InnoCentive and Harvard researchers , who will likely see government funding extended if their findings prove helpful to diabetes sufferers , medical research in general , and our shared knowledge of how to share knowledge .
" Open innovation is an effective way to solve scientific problems in the business world , " said Harvard Business School assistant professor and co-leader on the project Karim R. Lakhani , Ph.D. " According to my research , innovation contests can help reveal and foster unexpected and novel solutions to vexing scientific problems . "
The Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center 's first InnoCentive program divorces questions from answers , awarding prizes ranging from $ 2,500 to $ 10,000 to not only to experts who contribute the best answers but also to informed people outside the diabetes field or Harvard community who ask the best questions ( submit ideas by March 1 ; subsequent contests will address other issues ) .
" There are all these people out there – they may teach 19th century English literature – but they 're smart and motivated and their kid has diabetes , " said Dr. Eva Guinan of the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , director of Harvard Catalyst Linkages and co-leader of the project .
" For years , they 've watched their child do something , and they 've had no place to ask the question , ' Why is n't somebody looking into this ? '
" We want questions as well as answers , and we need to get them from a broader community because the same old people asking the same old questions in the same old way with slightly newer technology is not moving things fast enough or broadly enough for us to cope with these incredibly complicated diseases . "
To coin a medical analogy , if Harvard 's research community is a brain , it needs to form new neural connections between areas that had previously never been connected .
Complicated problems can only be tackled by a complicated organizational brain .
To date , most organizational brains are rudimentary and top - down rather constructed as a neural network , the way our more evolved brains are .
" That 's exactly right , " agreed Dr. Guinan .
" People talk about the really distal nodes , which is just what you just described .
It 's reaching into the formerly unconnected , or poorly connected , pockets of information and knowledge that are out there , that are otherwise not wired in … .
The experimental question is :
How do we do that in this environment , where knowledge is the coin of the realm . "
Dr. Guinan dreams that the contest will produce creative solutions , like one that kept her awake on Monday night :
How about an iPhone app with a wireless connection to heat and pressure sensors in shoes that compensate for the loss of sensation in diabetics ' feet ?
When diabetic patients develop unfelt sores it can lead to amputation .
Need a new nerve pathway from the foot to the brain ?
There will be an app for that , if Harvard 's challenge realizes Guinan 's hopes for this crowdsourcing experiment .
Dwayne Spradlin , InnoCentive president and CEO , says the medical establishment has a lot to learn from the crowd and crowdsourcing – but perhaps even more from itself .
" Research today is often about publishing , " he said .
" You might wait a year and a half for peer review , and that information is not yet being shared with other groups that would otherwise be doing derivative works .
Tearing down those boundaries can do nothing but compress the rates at which we drive innovation through these systems , and it is desperately needed . "
Most of the funding for this effort comes from taxpayers , in the form of a National Institute of Health grant , with additional funding from the Harvard Catalyst Program , a Harvard - lead consortium of medical organization whose goal is to " remove the barriers and obstacles to cross-institutional collaboration . "
When the United States government funds a crowdsourced social network at the oldest university in the country to make medical research more effective , it 's hard to deny that the Obama administration is making good on at least part of its pledge to bring the government and the institutions in line with the latest technology .
One reason the NIH is funding this crowdsourcing experiment is the hope that its findings will stretch subsequent research dollars further .
" Focusing across teams on solving very specific , well - defined problems could crack the code on collaboration and improve the yield of all of this medical research , " said Spradlin .
But in order for this government - funded crowdsourcing experiment to work , it will have to balance seemingly oppositional forces of competition and collaboration , especially because researchers tend to work in secret in order to edge out fierce competition for corporate funding and professorships .
But medical researchers , especially young ones , have ample incentive to participate despite research 's tradition of information control .
The contest offers them a chance for them to earn their stripes on the fast track .
Rather than filtering their ideas through the normal chain of command , or keeping their head down focused on a few specific micro-problems for their lab , they gain access to the big questions – and full credit for answering them .
And not only are younger researchers more comfortable with online tools like InnoCentive , says Dr. Guinan , but they have a different take on the line between public and private personae that makes them liable to share and exhibit a herd mentality that makes them more likely collaborators .
" I think that younger generations will embrace these things more , " said Dr. Guinan .
" The walls about what they do and do n't share is very low , and the degree to which they move as a herd is unbelievable … and they 're used to information spreading much more rapidly .
It 's much harder to hang onto information and have it be private . "
Apparently , what goes for teenagers socializing on Facebook and software engineers collaborating on a movie recommendation algorithm also goes for professional medical researchers .
Social networks are often thought of as a frivolous waste of time , but they may not be so frivolous after all , should they lead to more efficient medical research that saves lives .

For decades she has been seen as a decorative companion to Adolf Hitler , an apolitical " dumb blonde " whose attentions served as an occasional diversion for the Führer .
But the first academic biography of Eva Braun draws a different picture of the dictator 's long - standing girlfriend , claiming historians have hugely underestimated the role she played in his life .
Berlin historian Heike Görtemaker reveals her as a politically committed woman who won ­Hitler 's affections , enjoyed a healthy sex life with him , sympathised with Nazi politics and gave him psychological support .
Görtemaker spent three years researching her book , Eva Braun : Life With Hitler , due out this month from the prestigious CH Beck publishing house .
She was able to draw on previously unseen or little - known documents , letters , diary entries and photographs .
" Eva Braun features in films , plays , novels and historical memoirs , " Görtemaker told the Observer , " but is always portrayed as the dumb blonde who had the misfortune to fall in love with a devil , and this is an image that needs to be ­corrected .
She was capricious , an uncompromising advocate of unconditional loyalty towards the dictator who went so far as to die with him , and he adored her . "
According to Görtemaker 's account , Braun was fully aware of the twists and turns of Nazi policy - making and made no attempt to speak out against the Holocaust .
" She was in the loop and knew what was going on .
She was no mere bystander , " said the historian .
Hitler 's propaganda minister , Joseph Goebbels , noted in his diary that Braun was a " bright girl who meant a great deal to the Führer " .
Görtemaker has evidence that she was present at meetings between Hitler and high - ranking Nazis .
The relationship also had an every­day quality rarely explored by historians , such as rows with Hitler over domestic details and refusing to share his vegetarian diet .
" I ca n't eat that stuff , " she said .
Görtemaker blames British historians for shaping the image of Braun , claiming that writers such as Ian Kershaw and Hugh Trevor - Roper , and German historians such as Sebastian Haffner , judged her insignificant and her relationship with Hitler to be banal .
She claims that the late Lord Dacre ( Trevor - Roper ) did most to influence the traditional perception .
A wartime intelligence officer who carried out an official investigation into Hitler 's final days and conducted numerous interviews with his entourage after the war , he dismissed Braun in a single word as " uninteresting " .
" Trevor - Roper took his cue from Albert Speer [ Hitler 's armaments minister ] , whom he interviewed at length , " said Görtemaker .
" Speer said , ' for all writers of history , Eva Braun is going to be a disappointment ' , and claimed that women had no significant role to play in the Nazi party .
It was said of all the women , from the wives to the secretaries .
Speer was trying to protect his wife .
There was a strong movement to protect women in general , and so it became to be generally accepted that women had little role to play in the politics of the Third Reich . "
Hitler first came across Braun in 1929 , when he was 40 and she was 17 .
She worked in a Munich camera shop run by his official photographer , Heinrich Hoffmann .
According to Hoffmann 's daughter , Hitler 's opening line was : " May I invite you to the opera with me , Fräulein Eva ?
You see , I 'm surrounded by men and I know what a pleasure it is to enjoy female company . "
Dates at the cinema and restaurants followed .
Braun was with him in his Berlin bunker as the city fell to the Russian forces in 1945 and shared his suicide on the afternoon of 30 April .
Görtemaker said recognising that Hitler had a " normal relationship " was a vital part of the process of seeing him as a recognisable product of German society in the first half of the 20th century .
" He is mostly portrayed as incapable of having a private life , " she said .
" He said he could n't marry because he was married to Germany . "
The German public was never meant to know of Braun 's existence and marriage was out of the question until the very end .
He told Speer : " It 's just like an actor when he marries .
For the women who have worshipped him , he is no longer their idol in the same way . "
Braun had her own private quarters at his Berghof mountain retreat , where she whiled away the time between his visits with reading , enjoying the outdoors and partying .
" When he was there they led what can be called a bohemian existence , " said Görtemaker .
She is also " totally convinced " that , ­contrary to popular belief , they had a normal sex life .
Braun 's friends and relatives say she giggled on seeing a photograph of the British prime minister Neville Chamberlain sitting on a sofa in Hitler 's Munich flat in 1938 , and remarked : " If only he knew what goings - on that sofa has seen . "
" It just did n't fit into the picture people had of him .
Many women in particular did n't like it , asking how could anyone be good enough for Hitler , " said Görtemaker .
Well , this is definitely one of those T - shirt you want your girlfriend , love one , or maybe that hot neighbor to wear .
Ok , maybe not the hot neighbor since it ’s kind of creepy giving her this shirt as a gift .
As long as you follow the direction of the pad , everything will be allll right ( that is until you get a slap in your face ) .

This morning ’s guest post by Zarathustra , of the excellent Mental Nurse blog , flagged up the existence of a right - wing campaign group calling itself ‘ Nurses for Reform ’ , and as Lib Con ’s resident data hound that naturally prompted me to ask a very pertinant question :
Just exactly how many of the people behind ‘ Nurses for Reform ’ are actually nurses ?
Is this actually a genuine organisation that can point to a significant level of support within the nursing profession or it is , like the Taxpayers ’
Alliance , just another small , well funded , right - wing front organisation with a name carefully chosen to mislead the naive and unwary into taking it for something it almost certainly is n’t ?
So who , exactly , are ‘ Nurses for Reform ’ ?
Well , their director and primary mouthpiece is Dr Helen Evans RGN and she is , indeed , a nurse with 20 years experience in the NHS under her belt and a PhD in health management from Brunel University .
So she ’s a doctor , but not in the medical sense of the term .
As for her organisation , it claims to be a ‘ growing pan-European network of nurses dedicated to consumer - oriented reform of European healthcare systems ’ , although evidence of any links to like - minded nurses organisations or campaign groups are a bit thin on the ground .
The other noticeable feature of the NFR website is , with the exception of a page listing members of advisory board , the marked lack of reference to anyone other than Dr Helen Evans , who appears to be the site ’s sole contributor , contact point and , for all anyone knows , chief cook and bottle - washer .
Not exactly a flying start then , but there is an advisory board , so maybe we ’ll find a few more nurses there …
… or maybe not .
Let ’s run down the list , starting with :
Stuart Browning
Browning runs a website called Free Market Cure , which is actively involved in the campaign against Obama ’s healthcare reforms and ‘ socalised ’ medicine and is supported by the Moving Picture Institute .
Browning is a film director and entrepreneur with an established reputation for knocking out free - market propaganda films .
Dr Eamonn Butler
Butler is the current director of the Adam Smith Institute and has degrees in Philosophy , Economics and Psychology , although I doubt very much that the latter indicates that he has any background on the clinical side .
Dr Tim Evans
Evans is perhaps best known to bloggers as one of the two big wheels in the Libertarian Alliance , along with Sean Gabb .
He ’s also , just for the record , the Chief Executive of the Cobden Centre , a former President and Director General of the Centre for the New Europe and former Executive Director of Public Affairs at the Independent Healthcare Association .
Prior to that , in 1991 - 1992 , he was the Chief Economic and Political Adviser to the Slovak Prime Minister – Dr. Jan Carnogursky – and was Head of the Prime Minister ’s Policy Unit .
In the late 1980s he was the Assistant Director of the Foundation for Defence Studies and subsequently became a Senior Policy Consultant at the Adam Smith Institute .
When he ’s not working with the Cobden Centre , he ’s the Chairman of the Economic Policy Centre , Chairman of Global Health Futures Ltd , a Consultant Director and a Senior Fellow with the Adam Smith Institute .
Coincidentally , of course , his wife ’s name is Helen … Helen Evans …
Mmm , I ’ve heard that name before somewhere ?
Shane Frith
Frith is the director of right - wing think - tank Progressive Vision , which recently launched a group called ‘ Progressive Conservatives ’ , chaired by Tory MEP Syed Kamall , as a new group for ‘ classical liberals in the Conservative Party ’ .
If anything it looks to be ‘ brains ’ behind the Hannanite wing of the Tory Party , particularly when pitching for a Singapore - style healthcare system and the break - up of the BBC .
According to Conservative Home , Frith has worked for both Tory MP ’s in the UK and National Party MPs in native New Zealand and is a former chair of the International Young Democrat Union .
His immediate predecessor in that role was Tory MP Andrew Rosindell .
Ruth Lea
Yes this is the Ruth Lea , economist and former head of policy at the Institute of Directors .
You ’ve seen her on the TV enough to know her shtick .
So far , we ’re running a bit short of actual nurses but at least everyone on the advisory board , so far , has the kind of public profile that would make NFR look a bit ridiculous were it to try to conceal information about them .
That ’s all about to change .
Robert LeFever
LeFever is billed simply as a ‘ blogger ’ , although I ca n’t link to his blog at the moment because Google is putting up one of its ‘ this site may be harmful to your computer ’ messages against its search engire reference .
That said , modesty appears not to LeFever ’s strong suit as Google does provide this quotation from his blog :
“ Dr Robert Lefever is a Darwin of our times , speaking a truth regardless of who it may upset ; his insights and ideas will prove him to be a man way ahead of … ”
Apparently , the missing words at the end of the quotation are “ …his time in years to come .
Anyone seeking The [ sic ] real promise of addiction recovery should work only with Dr Robert Lefever . ” , which is just as well as no one could accuse him of being a man ahead of his own ego or promotional bullshit .
What NFR do n’t see fit to mention is LeFever ’s personal interest in a family - run private rehab clinic ( PROMIS ) .
Until fairly recently , Robert LeFever was usually described in the media as the clinic ’s director , although he ’s no longer listed in the staff page , unlike his son , Robin LeFever , the clinic ’s managing director .
Dr Robert LeFever was a GP before getting into the rehab business and while his son , Robin , lays claim to a BSc in Psychology on the clinic ’s website , he ’s not listed on either of the British Psychological Society ’s professional registers – which cover chartered psychologists and a very limited number of psychotherapists – so one would hope that he sticks firmly to management and leave the treatment side of things to others .
In 1998 , Robin told the BBC that he he ’d been addicted to cannabis in an article that describes him as ‘ running a marijuana rehabilitation centre ’ .
Three years later he was billed , by Glasgow ’s Sunday Mail , as a ‘ Scots - born financial whizz - kid ’ who ’d led a ‘ seedy double life ’ as a drug addict in a feature article published under the headline , ‘ Robin thought he was OK ..
“ heroin addicts did n’t wear suits and work in the city ; THE INCREDIBLE RICHES TO RAGS STORY OF A PROFESSIONAL JUNKIE ” [ their capitals , not mine ] .
More recently Robert has cropped up in a few places with the claim that he too was once an addict – gambling , shopping and work , apparently – but he ’s over all that now , save for his sole remaining addiction to maudlin political reminiscences , such as this lengthy article , which appeared in a Libertarian Alliance publication , under their copyright , in 2003 .
According to Robert , life was just peachy as an NHS GP until the introduction of Harold Wilson ’s ‘ social contract ’ in 1974 , although the reference at the end to “ my friend Tim Bell , Lady Thatcher ’s PR guru ” and the name check for Ayn Rand suggest that he ’s not the most unbiased observer of those times .
Moving on , we have …
Robert McIndoe
According to NFR , McIndoe is a ‘ British Nurse ’ [ Hooray !
A nurse at Last ! ]
According to Spinprofiles , McIndoe ’s real background is …
‘ founder and Managing Director ’ of a marketing agency called The Marketing House and an advisor for Nurse for Reform , a free market lobby group .
According to his ‘ LinkedIn ’ profile , McIndoe is ‘ Senior Business Consultant ’ at Logica ( December 2007 — Present ) ; Owner , The Marketing House ( February 2001 — Present ) ; ‘ Principal Consultant ’ Capita Advisory Services ( March 2006 — October 2007 ) ; ‘ Communications Consultant ’ NHS Connecting for Health ( 2005 — 2006 ) ; ‘ Stakeholder Management & Communications Team Leader ’ CSC ( 2004 — 2005 ) .
According to the Marketing House his past appointments have included ‘ senior public relations , communications and marketing roles for The Nuffield Trust , Surrey Oaklands NHS Trust , University College London Hospitals , The Royal Hospitals Trust and Hays DX .
… although he does have a nursing qualification ( RNM ) , which makes him a registered mental nurse , even if his academic background is that of an MA in Fine Arts from the University of St Andrews , which he followed up with an MBA in Creativity , Marketing and Finance via that fine socialist invention , the Open University and an MA in Theatre & Performance Studies at Rose Bruford College .
As is apparent from his profile , his ideological views on the NHS have n’t stopped him screwing money out of it as marketing consultant but , looking on the bright side , at least Nurses for Reform has managed to justify the use of a plural despite having previously given the impression that we might be looking here at something that was actually ‘ Nurse for Reform ’ .
That brings to the final name on the list :
Mr. John Wilden MRCP , FRCS
Wilden is a ‘ leading neurosurgeon with a practice in Harley Street ’ according to his profile at the Adam Smith Institute .
According to Grant Thornton , the London - based global network of independent accounting and consulting firms .
“ Global Healthcare Futures ( GHF ) is a UK company that is the brain child of John Wilden , a former specialist and consultant neurosurgeon .
GHF is developing and promoting software products for “ Time to Cure ” and “ Cost to Cure ” Common Diseases based on the advances of molecular biology and other technologies which will underpin the fast looming world of curative global healthcare , thereby ushering in a new age of diminishing healthcare costs across the developed and developing world ” .
Mmm… Global Healthcare Futures …
I ’ve heard that name before , somewhere ?
Silly me , I forgot to include the citation …
Dr Tim Evans , Chairman of Global Health Futures
Is it just me , or is anyone else getting deja vu ?
The CIA sat by as the Peruvian air force shot down a plane carrying a family of American missionaries , according to dramatic surveillance footage obtained by ABC News .
The incident took place above Peru ’s jungle canopy in 2001 .
Two people — Veronica Bowers and her infant daughter , Charity — were killed when the plane crash - landed into a muddy river .
The video contains chatter between a CIA spotter plane and Peruvian military as they try to figure out if the single - engine float plane spotted below them is being piloted by drug smugglers .
In fact , the plane contained American missionaries Jim and Veronica Bowers , their two children , along with a pilot , Kevin Donaldson .
The Bowers were flying back from a trip to Brazil when they attracted the attention of the military operation .
From the outset , the CIA operatives have their doubts .
“ I do n’t know if this is bandito or amigo , ” one CIA pilot says .
Throughout the video , the CIA officers and their Peruvian counterparts struggle to communicate , since neither speaks the other ’s language .
Before the Peruvians attack , they order the plane to land .
Donaldson did n’t hear the warning because he was tuned to another radio frequency .
As the Peruvians close in , the CIA pilots voice their concerns for the recording .
“ This guy does n’t fit the profile , ” one CIA operative says .
“ Okay , I understand that this is not our call .
But this guy is at 4,500 feet .
He is not taking any evasive action .
I recommend we follow him .
I do not recommend phase 3 ( shooting the plane down ) at this time , ” says another .
“ Is phase 3 authorize , okay , ” a Peruvian fighter jet says .
“ Okay , ” the American responds dubiously .
“ You sure it ’s bandito ? ”
“ Yes , ” the Peruvian replies .
“ I think we ’re making a mistake , ” the CIA pilot mutters .
“ I agree with you , ” says another .
The Peruvians close in .
The Bowers ’ pilot nervously radios a control tower nearby and wonders why the fighter jet is following him .
The CIA pilots , listening in , try to stop the attack .
But the Peruvians have already begun strafing the float plane .
“ They ’re killing me ! ” Donaldson screams in Spanish .
The CIA pilots jump in .
“ Tell him to terminate ! ” one shouts .
“ Do n’t shoot ! ” the other screams .
But the Bowers plane is already hit and begins to plunge to the ground .
Veronica Bowers and her 7 - month - old daughter , Charity , were already dead , struck by high - caliber bullets .
Despite being shot in the legs , Donaldson managed to steer the plane into a river .
Donaldson , Jim Bowers and the Bowers ’ six - year - old son , Cory , survived .
The issue of the downing of the Bowers plane has festered in the nearly 9 years since it happened .
The family ’s cause has been taken up Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan .
He has previously accused the CIA of covering up their involvement in the attack .
In 2008 , CIA inspector general John Helgerson accused his own outfit of covering up details of the incident .
The CIA ’s own investigation , concluded in 2005 , wrapped up without charges against anyone involved .
According to the New York Times , Helgerson ’s report accused the CIA drug interception operation in Peru of regularly confronting suspected drug traffickers “ without adequate safeguards to protect against the loss of innocent life . ”
On Wednesday , the CIA announced that it had disciplined 16 officers in connection with the case , including the officer in charge of counter - narcotics operations in Peru .
Then they deflected the blame onto the Peruvians .
“ CIA personnel had no authority either to direct or prohibit actions by that government , ” the agency wrote in a statement given to ABC .
“ CIA officers did not shoot down any airplane .
In the case of the tragic downing of April 21st , 2001 , CIA personnel protested the identification of the missionary plane as a suspect drug trafficker . ”

Birther Speaker Takes Heat at Tea Party Convention
Created : February 06 , 2010 11:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
NASHVILLE — During WorldNetDaily Editor - in - Chief Joseph Farah ’s Friday night dinner speech , which spent around 10 of its forty minutes on questions about Barack Obama ’s citizenship , Andrew Brietbart was among the conservatives in back of the room grumbling audibly about what he was hearing .
After he introduced the evening ’s closing entertainment — a film titled “ Generation Zero ” — Breitbart walked outside to the convention hall .
There , I heard Breitbart criticizing Farah , and briefly talked to him about it before I noticed that WorldNetDaily ’s Chelsea Schilling was already talking to him , holding up a voice recorder .
I backed up to allow her to continue her interview , which consisted of questions on why Breitbart did n’t think Obama ’s citizenship was a legitimate issue .
“ It ’s self - indulgent , it ’s narcissistic , it ’s a losing issue , ” Breitbart told Schilling .
“ It ’s a losing situation .
If you do n’t have the frigging evidence — raising the question ?
You can do that to Republicans all day long .
You have to disprove that you ’re a racist !
Forcing them to disprove something is a nightmare . ”
“ Would n’t you say , ” asked Schilling , “ in this case , that Farah is asking Obama to prove something rather than his disprove it ? ”
Breitbart rejected the premise .
“ When has a president ever been asked to prove his citizenship ? ”
After a few minutes Breitbart ended the conversation and Schilling started interviewing Tea Partiers about the speech , finding a little less skepticism .
( I found some Tea Partiers , like Rita Grace of Virginia , who said they did n’t appreciate Farah ’s speech . )
I spotted Farah and asked him if his speech had been approved by Tea Party Nation .
“ They asked me to speak , ” said Farah .
“ They did n’t ask me , ‘ What do you want to speak about ? ’
No , this operates like a free and open society , not like the kind of Marxist society you would apparently like to be a journalist for . ”
I told Farah that his speech was getting negative attention already , and that Breitbart , who ’d taken the stage after him , had criticized the “ birther ” parts of the speech .
Farah shook his head and walked over to Breitbart in what seemed like an attempt to debunk my question .
“ Andrew is my friend , ” said Farah .
“ He has the right to disagree , and he has the right to say anything to a socialist newspaper that he wants .
And if he wants to criticize his friend to you , and he ’s dumb enough to do that … ”
Breitbart raised his eyebrows .
“ I ’m dumb to do what ? ”
“ Criticize your friend to this socialist newspaper . ”
“ I was talking to her , ” said Breitbart , pointing to Schilling .
“ I was talking to you .
And I was saying that I disagreed on the birther stuff . ”
“ OK , well , did you know that Dave Weigel from The Washington Independent was ” –
“ I was talking to her , ” said Breitbart .
“ She was asking me if I thought it was wise to bring it up , and I said , no .
We have a lot of strong arguments to be making , and that is a primary argument .
That is an argument for the primaries that did not take hold .
The arguments that these people right here are making are substantive arguments .
The elections in Virginia , New Jersey and Massachusetts were all won not on birther , but on substance .
And to apply to this group of people the concept that they ’re all obsessed with the birth certificate , when it ’s not a winning issue – ”
“ It is a winning issue ! ”
“ It ’s not a winning issue . ”
“ It is !
It becomes even more of a winning issue when the press abrogates its responsibility – ”
“ You do n’t recognize it as a fundamentally controversial issue that forces a unified group of people to have to break into different parts ?
It is a schism of the highest order . ”
“ Nothing exposes the president ’s – ”
“ Then prove it ! ”
“ The press is n’t asking the question – ”
“ Prove it ! ”
“ Prove what ? ”
“ Prove your case . ”
“ I should prove , what , a birth certificate that may or may not exist ? ”
Farah had gotten irritated .
“ That ’s ridiculous .
You do n’t even understand the fundamental tenets of what journalism is about , Andrew .
It ’s not about proving things .
It ’s about asking questions and seeking truth . ”
Breitbart tensed up after that insult .
“ Right . ”
“ I know you ’re not a journalist , so that ’s fine .
But do n’t diminish people who ’ve been doing this for 35 years . ”
“ So you ’re going to go on record saying that I ’m not a journalist ? ”
“ Are you ?
I ’ve never heard you claim to be .
Are you ? ”
“ I ’ll let it be answered by you . ”
“ Well , I knew Drudge did n’t consider himself a journalist , so I assumed that you were . …
I do n’t know , I ’m not trying to insult you . ”
“ You did . ”
At that point , Judson Phillips — who had spotted a very small crowd around us — walked into the fray and tried to simmer everyone down with a joke .
“ I can give you absolutely conclusive and definitive proof that Obama ’s birth certificate does not exist .
How else do you explain why Joe Biden is vice president ? ”
That more or less ended the conversation — Farah moved on , and agreed to talk more about why he and WorldNetDaily continued to pursue stories on Obama ’s citizenship .
The citizenship issue had stuck around and taken off , he said , “ because of us . ”
He ran stories asking questions about the issue — including stories that were quickly debunked — because the rest of the media was n’t asking the questions .
“ Do you think this has made my life easier , doing this ? ” asked Farah .
“ I used to be on TV all the time .
I have n’t been on Fox News once since I started talking about this . ”
Asked whether he thought his speech created any problems for Sarah Palin — prompting reporters to ask why she patronized a convention with rhetoric like this —
Farah rejected the premise .
“ Sarah Palin is a big girl , ” he said .
“ She can take care of herself .
I have a lot of confidence that she ’ll take care of herself well .
…
My objective is not to get Sarah Palin elected or something .
My job as a journalist is to seek the truth . ”

The PLO official was going to dinner with a friend , who was waiting by the front desk .
As they pushed out the Meridien 's front door , they both noticed a man on a divan looking intently at them .
It was odd enough that at dinner they called a contact in the French police .
The policeman advised the PLO official to go directly back to the hotel after dinner and stay put .
The police would look ...

SPIM A MIPS32 Simulator
James Larus
spim@larusstone.org Microsoft Research
Formerly : Professor , Computer Sciences Department , University of Wisconsin- Madison
spim has moved to SourceForge.org .
New versions of spim are at that site .
This site only contains old versions of the simulator .
Why move ?
SourceForge offers a number of services , such as a source code repository and collaborative tools , that make it easier to share code with other developers .
Now that spim has an open source license , the time has come to move off a 20 - year old web site and join the 21st century .
What 's New ?
QtSpim is a new user interface for spim built on the Qt UI framework .
Qt is cross-platform , so the same user iterface and same code will run on Windows , Linux , and Mac OS X ( yeah ! ) .
Moreover , the interface is clean and up - to - date ( unlike the archaic X windows interface ) .
Spim has moved to SourceForge !
The source code for all version of spim are in an SVN repository and compiled version are available for download .
There is also a bug tracker and discussion forum .
spim is a self - contained simulator that runs MIPS32 programs .
It reads and executes assembly language programs written for this processor .
spim also provides a simple debugger and minimal set of operating system services .
spim does not execute binary ( compiled ) programs .
spim implements almost the entire MIPS32 assembler - extended instruction set .
( It omits most floating point comparisons and rounding modes and the memory system page tables . )
The MIPS architecture has several variants that differ in various ways ( e.g. , the MIPS64 architecture supports 64 - bit integers and addresses ) , which means that spim will not run programs compiled for all MIPS processors .
MIPS compilers also generate a number of assembler directives that spim cannot process .
These directives usually can be safely ignored .
Earlier versions of spim ( before 7.0 ) implemented the MIPS - I instruction set used on the MIPS R2000 / R3000 computers .
This architecture is obsolete ( though , never surpassed for its simplicity and elegance ) .
spim now supports the more modern MIPS32 architecture , which is the MIPS - I instruction set augmented with a large number of occasionally useful instructions .
MIPS code from earlier versions of SPIM should run without changes , except code that handles exceptions and interrupts .
This part of the architecture changed over time ( and was poorly implemented in earlier versions of spim ) .
This type of code will need to be updated .
Examples of new exception handling are in the files : exceptions.s and Tests / tt.io.s .
spim comes with complete source code and documentation .
It also include a torture test to verify a port to a new machine .
spim implements both a terminal and a window interface .
On Microsoft Windows , Linux , and Mac OS X , the spim program provides the simple terminal interface and the QtSpim program provides the windowing interface .
spim turned 20 years old January 2010 .
I wrote the original version of spim as the target machine for my first compiler class at University of Wisconsin , Madison in the spring semester 1990 .
spim is likely older than most of the students currently using it !
As a birthday present , the 8.0 version of spim has a simpler , less restrictive license , namely the standard BSD license .
The newest version of spim is called QtSpim , and unlike all of the other version , it runs on Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux — the same source code and the same user interface on all three platforms !
QtSpim is the version of spim that currently being actively maintaned .
The other versions are still available , but please stop using them and move to QtSpim .
It has a modern user interface , extensive help , and is consistent across all three platforms .
QtSpim makes my life far easier , and will likely improve yours and your students ' experience as well .
A compiled , immediately installable version of QtSpim is available for Microsoft Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux can be downloaded from : https://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/.
Full source code is also available ( to compile QtSpim , you need Nokia 's Qt framework , a very nice cross- platform UI framework that can be downloaded from here ) .
Older Versions of SPIM
The information in this shaded box describes the older versions of SPIM .
Please use QtSpim instead .
Most Recent Versions of SPIM Platform Program Form File Unix or Linux system
Mac OS X spim
xspim Source code http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/
Microsoft Windows ( spim 7.0 and later versions no longer run on Windows 95/98 .
Use version 6.5 or earlier . )
PCSpim Executable http://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/PCSpim_9.0.zip/download
Source code http://spimsimulator.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/spimsimulator/
To run spim or xspim on a Unix , Linux , or Mac OS X system , get the source code from the SourceForge repository and compile it for your system .
To run PCspim under Microsoft Windows , download the file http://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/PCSpim_9.0.zip/download , unzip it , and click on setup.exe .
Source for the Microsoft Windows version ( PCspim ) is available SourceForge repository .
There is no native Macintosh version of spim ( but there is a QtSpim version ) .
However , xspim compiles and runs on Mac OS X , if you can find a way to install the Xaw library .
Installing Older Versions of SPIM Microsoft Windows
To run PCspim under Microsoft Windows , download the file http://sourceforge.net/projects/spimsimulator/files/PCSpim_9.0.zip/download.
Unzip the file .
Click on the setup.exe program .
Unix , Linux , or Mac OS X ( Note : the directions changed slightly for version 7.2 , to reflect a new directory structure .
Please read carefully . )
Installation is a bit more complex for a Unix or Linux system , as you need to compile the program for your particular computer and operating system .
Download the files from the SourceForge repository .
You do n't need the Boneyard directory , which contains old versions , but the other directories are useful .
The simple terminal interface is contained in the spim - 8.0 / spim directory and the X - windows interfaces is in the spim - 8.0 / xspim directory .
The other directories are described in the README file .
Next , you must set the directories in which spim will be installed by editing the Makefile ( the file that contains instructions on building spim ) .
In general , if you are installing spim and want the windowing version ( xspim ) , edit the file xspim / Imakefile .
If you do n't want xspim or are running on a system without X - windows installed , you use the file spim / Makefile .
The programs are installed in standard locations , but you can change the pathnames to other locations : EXCEPTION_DIR --
The full pathname of the directory in which to install the spim exception handler ( exceptions .s ) .
BIN_DIR --
The full pathname of the directory in which spim and xspim should be installed .
MAN_DIR --
The full pathname of the directory in which the manual pages for spim and xspim should be installed .
In general , the remaining parameters in a Makefile need not be changed .
Then , if you are building xspim , change to the spim - 8.0 / xspim directory and type :
% xmkmf
% make
If you do not have a copy of xmkmf , you can use the Makefile in the xspim directory , but beware that it may not work on your system because the paths to the X windows libraries could be different .
If you do not have X - windows , change to thespim - 8.0 / spim directory , edit Makefile , and type :
% make
To run spim or xspim , the exception handler must be installed in the directory specified by the variable EXCEPTION_DIR in the Makefile .
If the file exception .s is not installed , spim and xspim fail before they start running .
You can either install this file by hand or by typing :
% make install
which also installs spim or xspim , and the manual pages in the directories that you set ( above ) .
You may need root permission to install these files , in which case type :
% sudo make install
To test that spim is correctly built , change to the spim - 8.0 / spim directory and type :
% make test
and examine the output of the test .
( Note : the exception handler must be installed before running the test . )
The current version of spim is 9.0 ( January 2011 ) , which is a major release that introduces QtSpim and fixes some bugs in all versions :
Add Debian package and Linux desktop metadata .
Moved SVN repository to SourceForge .
Fit and finish bugs in PCSpim and error parsing quoted command line arguments .
QtSpim !!!

Ported PCSpim to VisualStudio 2010 .
Fixed type errors so code compiles under Linux and on x64 systems .
Moved version information into CPU / version.h and eliminated old , ad - hoc Configure file for spim and xpsim .
The current version of spim is 8.0 ( January 2010 ) , which is a minor release that cleans up bugs in 7.5 and moves to a BSD license :
Changed install path from / usr to /usr / local and removed - D option to install command ( which does n't exists on Mac OS X ) .
Change license to a BSD license , update copyright notices , and eliminated references to my old email address .
Simplify alignment of data on stack to ensure enough room is left for environment and args at top of stack .
Initialize stack with arguments when running program from run dialog .
read_input filled buffer with last character of file not terminated by newline .
Links to MIPS documentation were broken .
Did not return value from exit syscall .
The current version of spim is 7.5 ( August 2009 ) , which is a minor release that cleans up bugs in 7.4 :
Correct problem with installer script that did not install appropriate versions of msvcrt and mfc dlls for Visual Studio 9.0 .
Fix install scripts to put exceptions.s at /usr / lib / spim on Linux .
Fixed major memory leak caused by overwritten instructions not being freed .
Force redisplay of data segment in situations when register values ( such as $ sp ) have changed .
Properly initialize PC at first invocation of step operation on PCSPim .
Fixed bug in Xxpim that caused the step commend to reinitialize the stack .
The current version of spim is 7.4 ( January 2009 ) , which is a minor release that cleans up bugs in 7.3 :
1/14/09 : Released new version of pcspim.zip to correct problem with installer script that did not install appropriate versions of msvcrt and mfc dlls .
1/21/09 : Released new version of spim.tar .Z and spim.tar.gz to correct problem with install command for spim program ( but not xspim ) .
Fixed install directories for Linux systems .
Retained command line arguments in second and subsequent runs .
Bug in overflow from low - order word in MADD , MSUB .
Bug in decoding SPECIAL2 instructions ( e.g. madd ) .
The previous version of spim is 7.3 ( August 2006 ) , which is a minor release that cleans up a number of bugs in 7.2 :
Fix for flex 2.5.33 ( internal change broke spim's scanner ) .
Exception handler can be a semicolon - separated list of files that will be loaded in order .
On Unix , SPIM_EXCEPTION_HANDLER
environment variable is consulted before command line arguments .
Memory corruption caused spim to crash when label was defined twice in succession .
PCSpim updates register and memory display after a parse error while reading a file .
Eliminated unnecessary null char between strings in list of strings produced by .asciiz .
Makefiles ( in spim / and xspim / ) now contain clearly defined paths for installing executables , exception handler , and man pages .
The man pages are no longer installed by the " make install " command .
Change psfig to epsfig in spim.tex ( does anyone still use this obsolete documentation ? ) .
The previous version of spim is 7.2.1 ( August 2005 ) , which is a minor release that cleans up a number of bugs in 7.1 :
Fixed multiple problems in memory mapped IO in xspim and spim .
( Note : to make programming uniform across all three platforms , memory mapped IO now follows " Unix " handling of carriage return ( CR ) and new line ( NL ) characters .
On input , a CR is translated to a NL , and on output , a CR is printed after a NL .
This was previously true for PCSpim and xspim , but not spim . )
Fixed bug in indexed address computation in LW and SW instructions .
Eliminated non-POSIX flags IUCLC and IXANY to facilitate port to Mac OS X .
Use termios ( 3 ) library calls instead of IOCTLs to fix bug introduced in port from termio to termios struct .
Test default case for jalr , without default $rd ( =31 ) .
Trap handler in test extracted wrong bits from ExcCode field of Cause register .
Pervasive restructuring of files to put 3 UIs ( spim , xspim , PCSpim ) in separate directories and cleanup organization and Makefiles .
Use correct help file in install process .
Added work - around for bug in flex 2.5.31 that left yytext_ptr undefined .
Epilogue code restored $ at register , then used a pseduo instructions that smashed it .
Cleared filename when reinitializing PCSpim , which broke next reload command .
The previous version of spim is 7.1 ( January 2005 ) , which is a minor release that cleans up a number of bugs in 7.0 :
Minor cleanup .
Switched Windows installer to Microsoft .msi installer , from InstallShield .
exceptions.s used wrong mask for exception cause field .
Clearing the transmitter or receiver interrupt enable bits also clear interrupt pending bits in Cause register .
Code to poll for a console input character in X windows blocked and prevented any output until input occured .
Type of " mul " instruction was wrong , which lead to it being printed without destination register .
Print underlying instruction , not breakpoint .
Unparing error that unparsed beq as beql .
Eliminated dependence on obsolete termio.h in favor of POSIX termios.h since Mac OS X does n't have termio.h any more .
Fix null pointer problem if no entries in registry .
Turn off EXL bit after break instruction , since break is handled by spim , not MIPS , code and the bit was never cleared .
Set default path for exceptions.s to C : \Program Files \PCSpim , the default installation directory .
Test for SQRT.S used double constant , which failed on SPARC ( but not x86 ) .
The previous version of spim is 7.0 ( August 2004 ) , which is a major release that contains a significant number of changes from version 6.5 :
Upgraded simulator to MIPS32 , Version 1 architecture ( except details of FPU and memory ) .
Exceptions and interrupts reimplemented , to make them closer to the actual hardware .
Memory mapped IO console reimplemented to make it work properly .
Implemented timer in CPU .
Renamed " trap " to " exception " to correspond to MIPS terminology .
Introduced short forms of command line arguments and dropped need for " - file " argument .
Major internal cleanup and reorganization of code to eliminate unused code and simplify implementation .
PCSpim prompts about reinitialization when file reloaded .
PCSpim lets user set font .
Word align all segment boundaries and ensure sbrk returns word - aligned addresses .
Added new syscall ( EXIT2_SYSCALL ) that returns value from SPIM .
Improved implementation of delayed load instructions .
Refactored the test cases , so that endian - independent code is in tt.core.s
Many small bug fixes .
Outstanding bugs in 7.0 :
The trap handler ( exceptions .s ) fails when the trapping instruction is in the delay slot of a branch or jump .
The trap handler returns by simplemindedly adding 4 to the EPC ( which is the branch 's address in this case ) , so it does not return to the instruction executed after the trapping instruction .
Handling of newlines and carriage returns is inconsistent between platforms .
When a program prints a newline , PCSpim also prints a carriage return , spim and xspim do n't .
Or , is this consistent with the underlying platform ?
The previous version of spim is 6.5 ( January 2003 ) , which contains the following changes from version 6.4 :
If started program is started with only one argument , assume it is a file name .
Added Alt - F4 shortcut to PCSpim .
Fixed trap .handler to return to instruction at EPC on interrupt .
Fixed ( real ! ) hardware exception on integer overflow in division .
- trap_file did not properly parse argument in xspim .
Fixed printing of error on last line without a carriage return .
Print proper registers when printing hex FP numbers .
Properly zero newly allocated memory .
Added nops ( addu $ 0 , $ 0 , 0 ) to trap handler , so that it works properly in bare mode !
PCSPIM.HLP file was corrupted .
The previous version of spim is 6.4 ( January 2002 ) , which contains the following changes from version 6.3 :
PCSpim no longer shifts the focus of the register and data segments when values change .
Fixed bug in the expansion of USH pseudo - op .
Add system calls for open , close , read , and write .
Fixed the Configure file to work with Mac OSX .
Made the REM pseudo - op require 3 arguments .
Fixed PCSpim dumping code to dump contents of console window .
Treat LUI 's immediate value as unsigned , as it is not sign extended .
More error checking for malformed programs .
Make symbol " main " as global .
Avoid clearing last few bytes of data segments when they expand .
Check that high - order 4 bits in jump instruction 's PC match bits in target PC .
The previous version of spim is 6.3 ( January 2001 ) , which contains the following changes from version 6.2 :
PCSpim interface simplified to 4 fixed panes , similar to xspim , which permit cut and paste .
PCSpim console stays on the screen after assembly program terminates .
Comments in assembly source displayed in text segment .
NOP is standardized to sll $ 0 $ 0 0 ( = 0x00000000 )
Fixed several bugs and missed optimization in computing immediate values in lw / sw instruction sequences .
High 2 bits in negative branch offsets were incorrect .
Display floating point registers with up to 18 digits of precision .
New spim command ( print_all_regs ) prints all registers .
Minor changes to compile spim under cygwin for Windows .
Validate the range of immediate values in MIPS ( but not pseudo ) instructions .
Fixed display of stack with non-word aligned $ sp .
New flags : - delayed - branches Simulate MIPS delayed control transfers for branches , jumps , and calls - delayed - loads Simulate MIPS non-interlocked loads .

A scientist with the World Health Organisation has testified , during ongoing hearings in Strasbourg , France , that the swine flu pandemic was part of an overblown “ angst campaign ” , devised in conjunction with major drug companies to boost profits for vaccine manufacturers .
Professor Ulrich Keil , director of the WHO ’s Collaborating Centre for Epidemiology , slammed the organization and its flu chief , Dr Keiji Fukuda while giving evidence before The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe ( PACE ) .
“ With SARS , with avian flu , always the predictions are wrong …
Why do n’t we learn from history ? ”
Keil said .
“ It [ swine flu ] produced a lot of turmoil in the pubic and was completely exaggerated in contrast with all the really important matters we have to deal with in public health . ”
The WHO adviser on heart disease , added that the decision had led to a “ gigantic misallocation ” of health budgets .
“ We know the great killers are hypertension , smoking , high cholesterol , high body mass index , physical inactivity and low fruit and vegetable intake , ” he said .
“ In spite of all these facts , governments instead wasted huge amounts of money by investing in pandemic scenarios whose evidence base is weak . ”
PACE , a 47 nation body encompassing democratically elected members of parliament , will determine whether a “ falsified pandemic ” was declared by WHO in June 2009 on the advice of medical advisors , many of whom have close financial ties to the very pharmaceutical giants – GlaxoSmithKline , Roche , Novartis , – that produced the H1N1 vaccines .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
It will also look into the controversy surrounding the fact that two shots were initially advised when it was later revealed that one dose was entirely suitable , as well as investigating concerns over hastily developed vaccines containing adjuvants .
Pharmaceutical companies are thought to have made a profit of somewhere in the region of $ 7.5 - $ 10 billion on H1N1 vaccines , recouping the billions they had invested in researching and developing pandemic vaccines after the bird flu scares in 2006 and 2007 .
The worldwide death toll from H1N1 is thought to be around 13,500 , just over a third of the number who die from regular flu every year in the U.S. alone .
Heading the hearings is the former chairman of the Health Committee of PACE , Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg .
A former German lawmaker , a medical doctor and epidemiologist .
Wodarg has referred to the swine flu pandemic as “ one of the greatest medical scandals of the century . ”
Wodarg has pointed out that the WHO softened the definition of a pandemic from an outbreak in several continents at once with an above - average death rate , to one where the spread of the disease is constant .
Just one month after changing the definition , and with just 144 people having died from H1N1 , the flu was given the highest threat classification possible , a “ stage - six pandemic alert ” .
By comparison , the mildest 20th Century pandemic killed a million people .
“ I have never heard such a worldwide echo to a health political action , ” Wodarg , an epidemiologist who formerly led the health committee for the Council of Europe , said at Tuesday ’s hearing .
“ It was stated in panic - stricken terms that this was a flu that could threaten humanity and a great number of humans could fall ill .
This is why billions of dollars of medications were bought . ”
Wodarg said .
He added that the the change in definition “ made it possible for the pharmaceutical industry to transform this opportunity into cash , under contracts which were mainly secret . ”
“ In my view , the WHO undertook an incomprehensible action , which cannot be justified by scientific evidence .
The Council of Europe should investigate this to see how WHO can undertake this kind of dangerous nonsense , ” said Dr Wodarg .
WHO ’s flu chief , Dr Fukuda , insisted that its swine flu scientists do not have conflicts of interest owing to close links with pharmaceutical companies .
“ Let me state clearly for the record – the influenza pandemic policies and responses recommended and taken by WHO were not improperly influenced by the pharmaceutical industry . ”
Fukuda told the inquiry .
He said those calling the epidemic fake were wrong and irresponsible .
PACE ’s findings are expected to be announced January 29 and will likely be followed by an in - depth study and recommendations to European governments .

Today I found out Twilight was rejected by fourteen publishers before finally getting published .
In other news , fourteen out of fifteen publishing houses have quality standards on works they accept .
Though of course , in this case at least , having no literary standards seems to have paid off for lucky number fifteen .
So good on ya to them .
Boggles the mind that a poorly written story about a young girl who ’s trying to choose between necrophilia and bestiality could do so well ; especially considering one of the main characters is a 108 year old pedophile who spends his years hanging out around high school aged girls .
But apparently over 17 million young girls and a disturbing number of grown women , seem not to care .
Stay classy ladies .
Stay classy .

Surges of large - scale retail bankruptcies such as Circuit City electronics and Mervyns department stores altered the shopping landscape in 2009 -- and experts say 2010 is likely to bring even more changes .
Amid a still - tepid economic recovery , big retail chains are expected to continue closing their less productive stores and retrenching on expansion plans .
But at the same time , others will be hurtling into the breach to take advantage of falling rents and vacancies in neighborhoods they could n’t get into a few years ago .
“ The prediction for next year is more re-sizing and relocating of retailers , ” said real estate broker Richard Rizika of CB Richard Ellis .
There are almost 100 empty big - box retail stores in Los Angeles County , according to a study by Rizika .
They have a combined total of 4.5 million square feet , or about 78 football fields ’ worth of vacant space for rent or sale .
Most of that came from liquidated businesses Circuit City Inc. , Mervyns and home furnishings chain Linens ‘n Things Inc .
Neighborhood and community shopping centers in Los Angeles experienced falling rents and rising vacancies in the third quarter , according to real estate data provider Reis Inc .
About 5.7 % of the space is empty , a slight increase from a year earlier .
Taking advantage of bargain rents , big - box retailers PetSmart Inc. and Staples Inc. are introducing smaller stores that will enable them to fit into more expensive or more urban locations where space is at a premium , Rizika said .
Bargain - chic women ’s clothier Forever 21 Inc. , once a chain of small boutiques , is upping the ante by moving into full - size department stores abandoned by Mervyns .
Nordstrom Rack , the lower - priced cousin of Nordstrom , snagged some of the empty spots too , but company spokesman Colin Johnson said the expansion did n’t reflect a companywide shift into selling lower - priced goods .
“ This was a strategy we put in place before the downturn began , ” he said , and the recession has given Seattle - based Nordstrom Inc. the chance to get into new locations at bargain rates .
Also moving aggressively into big spaces vacated by failed retailers is Wisconsin - based Kohl ’s Corp. , which added seven new stores in Los Angeles County in 2009 .
The mid-tier department store has assumed leases and bought empty buildings throughout California as part of a growth strategy .
Popular upscale stores such as Nordstrom are still highly sought after by mall owners , but the less - pricey Kohl ’s , Target and even so - called dollar stores such as 99 Cents Only have lately earned respect from landlords , said retail property expert Michael Wiener .
“ Deep discounters have proliferated and will move into more attractive locations , ” Wiener said .
“ All of a sudden they are the darlings and can have the pick of the litter . ”
Wiener is chief executive of Excess Space Retail Services Inc. , a New York company that helps retailers figure out what to do with store space they ca n’t use anymore .
With unemployment still high , more tough times are ahead for stores and retail landlords , he predicted .
As many as 8,000 stores will close nationwide in the first half of 2010 , Wiener said , and more grief will follow for landlords who have bank loans coming due while facing declining occupancy and rents .
“ We think the industry will suffer well into 2011 . ”
Contributing to the heartache , at least for landlords , Wiener said , will be a source most casual observers assumed retailers had made peace with : the Internet .
Most stores have mastered the process of selling online and will find less need for bricks - and - mortar stores in the years ahead , he said .
The prediction that online shopping would be the undoing of malls was first made during the Internet gold rush of the 1990s , but instead malls thrived and expanded .
“ People did n’t quite trust the Internet , ” Wiener said .
Now they ’re more technically savvy and the percentage of shopping they do online is probably going to get bigger .
Online shopping accounted for less than 1 % of all retail sales at the end of 1999 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .
Ten years later , Internet sales were almost 4 % of the total .
“ There ’s still a lot of upside for the Internet , ” Wiener said .
Also worrisome for retailers and their landlords are consumer spending patterns , a recent report by investment bank Hovde Capital Advisors said .
Rocked by recession and a shaky job market , people are saving more and spending less .
They also have less access to credit through credit cards and home equity loans .
“ These trends do not bode well for mall fundamentals , ” the Hovde report said .
Mall landlord Sandy Sigal acknowledges that 2009 was tough on the retail industry , but he holds a more optimistic view of the future .
“ Last year was panic and desperation ” for tenants , some of whom begged his Woodland Hills company , NewMark Merrill Cos. , to let them stop paying rent , Sigal said .
Now , “ they are more realistic .
Tenants are getting better at learning how to survive in this market . ”
NewMark has helped them learn by subsidizing business consultants to advise tenants and by pitching in to fund direct mail campaigns , social marketing and other advertising programs .
“ The idea is to teach tenants to fish , ” he said .
Undercover “ secret shopper ” surveys show service at stores is improving , he said .
“ In the long run , you are going to have survivors who get darn good at what they do .
What ’s left is the best of class . ”
Running hot these days , he said , are drugstores , such as CVS , that offer a wide range of merchandise and keep long hours .
“ People use them as minimarkets now , ” Sigal said .
Discount stores , including grocers such as Food 4 Less , also are doing well , he said .
Others are still in pain , he said .
“ I would n’t want to be in high - end clothing or jewelry right now . ”

Observing History - Heathrow Robbery Trial Starts Without Jury [...]
This morning I went to the Royal Courts of Justice to personally witness the start of the first modern criminal trial in the UK where the defendants have been denied a jury .
That should probably say " England & Wales " rather than " the UK " , given the Diplock courts in Northern Ireland .
My views on this are : * It a terrible indictment on our police that they are unable to protect jurors and have n't been able to bring those disrupting the judicial process to justice themselves .
* By removing the right to a jury trial a key safeguard against state abuse of power has been eroded .
* I am concerned that this trial may be the first of many .
If the police can't deal with jury intimidation connected with a robbery ; how would they cope if problems occurred in a terrorist trial , there the consequences of a justice not being done , and not being seen to be done , could itself incite more anger and further terrorist acts .
I am concerned that what has started today may ultimately make the UK less safe .
Agreed !
The usual security theatre ( metal detectors , X - ray machines ) etc. greets those entering the Royal Courts of Justice court complex .
Staff were fairly relaxed though ; the man who entered in front of me said he was carrying a hard disk containing CCTV footage for use in a trial and asked if the X - Ray machine would damage it .
Security officers waved the man straight through without looking in his rucksack .
that is a Security FAILURE , which makes a mockery of the public money spent on the X - Ray machine and the " trained " staff !
[...]
.
The judge said that there had been plans , if the press presence had been larger , to allow the press to sit in the jury seats ; the journalists responded with a half - gasp , half - laugh . [..]
So this " trial without a jury " , very nearly started of as " trial by the press and media " !
The judge then asked the prosecution barrister if there were to be any reporting restrictions .
In response the prosecutor referred to restrictions imposed by the court of appeal .
The press ( and I - though the speech was addressed only to the official press ) are forbidden from reporting the names of other defendants who are not being tried in the current trial but are alleged to have been involved in the robbery .
One effect of this is to make it harder for people identify any further trial from the court lists if / when it takes place .
The former home address of a witness - which is to be mentioned at some point in the trial - can also not be reported .
How exactly is a third party blogger or media organisation not physically present in Court , actually meant to know about these reporting restrictions ?
Prosecutor Simon Russell Flint QC then began ; passing what he had trouble not calling the " Jury bundle " to the judge .
Aided by illustrations , maps , etc. in the bundle Mr Flint outlined the case ; starting with the fact that the events occurred six years ago and described them as a " professionally planned , professionally executed robbery " .
He listed precise amounts in various currencies which were stolen and then , using a 2004 exchange rate to convert to sterling rather pompously announced the full amount down to the penny .
Will the same misleading claims be made by the prosecution and the media about this being " the biggest " attempted armed robbery in the UK ?
We wrote about this aspect of the reporting of this case , on May 18 , 2004 :
Heathrow robbery attempt is NOT the biggest in Britain
The infamous Brinks Mat gold bullion robbery in November 1983 netted the criminals £ 26 million pounds worth of gold bullion - 6800 bars - about 3 tons of gold .
This would have been worth over £ 55 million at today 's prices , c.f the Office of National Statistics regarding inflation in the UK since 1750 ( .pdf )
The BBC also fails to remind its audience of the largest attempted armed robbery in the UK - the Millennium Dome Diamonds heist - Operation Magician , which attempted to steal over £ 200 million pounds worth of diamonds .( worth over £ 213 million at today 's prices ) .
Subsequently , in 2006 , the Securitas depot robbery involved over £ 53 million in banknotes .
The " story " of the robbery was then outlined in a painfully slow and repetitive manner , adding little to what has been written about in the press .
Interesting elements include : * Heavy reliance by the police on evidence of phone usage ( who called who , when and for how long ) .
* Evidence from " Cell Site " records ; was being used to infer " opportunities for meetings " when two phones were near .
* The defendants were alleged to have taken on a plan devised by others .
One thing which struck me was that the police were very closely following this group ; they had been recording their conversations and knew their target yet they did n't act to prevent the robbery taking place - a robbery in which a gun was fired multiple times and someone could have been seriously injured or killed .
" Evidence from " Cell Site " records ; was being used to infer " opportunities for meetings " when two phones were near . "
When used as part of a targeted criminal investigation , where the investigators are fully aware of the background details , then this is a useful investigatory technique .
Whether it provides proper evidence , rather than mere suspicion , of a physical meeting
is not all clear , especially if there is no direct voice phone / SMS text or data call record evidence between the alleged participants .
This technique must not be used to speculatively trawl through the billions of retained Communications Traffic Data records of hundreds of millions of innocent European Union citizens , thereby tarring them with " guilt by association " simply for having been in unwitting close proximity with suspected criminals .
The fact that the alleged armed robbers were already under such intensive surveillance by the Police , means that they were collecting and analysing current and perhaps even near real timeCommunications Traffic Data .
This provides no justification whatsoever for mandatory Communications Data Retention of innocent people 's data for at least a year .
While in the UK the doors of courts are almost always open there is n't much transparency in the justice system as :
It is hard to find out when cases of interest are scheduled .
I found out the date and location of this one via a FOI request .
As I knew the defendants names I could have watched the official court lists daily and got a few hours notice , but that is n't possible with local magistrates courts .
Court papers are not published online .
Had today 's " jury bundle " ; been published everyone in court ( and outside ) could have followed along .
As the request from the member of the press highlights the full list of charges was neither read out or made available on paper .
The Stockwell Inquest and Diana Inquest show how transcripts , evidence and court papers can be effectively published online making the process accessible .
As I understand it - while the taxpayer pays for the recording and transcription of court cases the results are not automatically released to the public ;
We agree that Justice is not being seen to be done fairly , because of the secrecy and the internet incompetence of the UK Courts system .

He chose some of the best known and most recognizable monuments of culture , natural beauty and famous world events because their images are shown so many times and they are carved in our memory exactly as they are .
Because they are often found as a motif on tourist postcards , Georg has reached the same manner for his presentation .

Furthur :: 12.31 :: Bill Graham Civic Auditorium :: San Francisco , CA
Furthur :: 12.31 :: San Francisco
If you have not yet seen , this is what you need to know :
This is a living , breathing band capable of rocking , spacing , and generating some serious psychedelic boogie .
I think it ’s safe to say that everyone inside the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium on New Year ’s
Eve felt blessed to once again be able to celebrate this high holiday of improvisational rock & roll with color , class , and amidst musical performances that seriously did right by the Grateful Dead ’s legacy .
Setlists aside , the story of this band is certainly John Kadlecik ( pronounced Kad ’ luh sik ) , clearly the most unapologetic Jerry - influenced member of any of the official post - Garcia projects .
But Kadlecik just might be the best thing to happen to “ The Dead ” in years .
I will admit to some serious ambivalence about the idea of inviting a sort of “ mimic ” into what I always assumed would be a relentlessly forward looking endeavor – the continued reinterpretation of the Garcia / Hunter catalog – until I realized that what JK ’s presence does is continue a tradition of musical searching with sincerity and intensity while also scratching the itch of having someone in there who really knows the internal architecture of Jerry ’s playing .
Perhaps what JK enables Phil and Bobby to do is to play like themselves again , to truly shine while utilizing the unique skills they built over 30 years – skills that were primarily used for the purpose of artfully darting around Jerry ’s world - class improvisational flights .
That ’s not to say I have not enjoyed , to degrees , the contributions of all the post - Jerry lead guitarists that have been brought into the fold .
I will say I was partial to the nimble , sunny , Strat - toned grace of Jimmy Herring , which seemed to me to best embody both the gravity and light - footedness of Garcia .
But unlike even Herring , I would say JK knows these songs as well as anyone , including Phil and Bobby – minus , of course , the experience of their composition , recording , and the accompanying memories of years of performance .
Weir & Kadlecik :: 12.31 :: San Francisco
And that leads me to what might be the strangest part of watching Weir take cues from JK ( yes , he did LEAD the band at times ) .
I wondered if the so - close - it ’s - scary Garcia guitar tone and vocal affectations might send the old - timers into some serious déjà vu , or if the simpatico might also encourage a kind of complacency from Weir and Lesh , as it subconsciously reminded them of shows , tours or years that were not particularly inspired .
Luckily JK lent a genuine enthusiasm to the proceedings , and a knowledge so deep and reverent that I think his contribution is resoundingly positive .
It took me a while to come to this resolve ( really over the course of both NYE shows , 12/30 and 12/31 ) , as I am still most drawn to , and intrigued by , the “ authentic gestures ” of Dead music ; meaning the two guys in this band who have become , in my estimation , much more than footnotes in history as individual musicians , but more like historically significant improvisational voices : Weir and Lesh .
I believe this is true not only for their association with the Grateful Dead , but because of their wholly unique approaches to guitar and electric bass , respectively .
On that note , rest assured that Phil was as clear - headed and powerful as ever on that strange Ritter bass of his , and Bobby remains one of the coolest “ rhythm ” guitar player , not just in rock & Roll , but maybe ever , switching between his pink Strat , ( that some older heads will remember from 88 - 89 , I believe it was his first MIDI - equipped axe ) , his Gibson hollow body ( circa 1974 ) and the blue Modulus with the lightning bolt sound holes .
The addition of Joe Russo on drums also cannot be underestimated , as his most direct , powerful playing retained a certain swing and finesse , and his interaction with longtime RatDog drummer Jay Lane frequently upped the energy level significantly .
This drum duo does not have the volcanic power of The Rhythm Devils , but lends the band a certain flexibility that comes with having just one full drum kit and one percussionist .
Jeff Chimenti , by now a very familiar face in this scene , remained his ever reliable self , playing all the right things almost always , and taking a few piano solos that brought the house down .
The other new faces onstage were two female singers who lent pretty harmony and background vocals to many songs on both nights .
This being a fairly dense band , however , their contributions were frequently overshadowed or undermixed .
Phil Lesh :: 12.31 :: San Francisco
The first half of the first set on New Year ’s Eve felt like an old school Dead show , when songs were not all necessarily connected by long segues .
We were able to ease into what was going to be a long evening with combustible versions of “ Shakedown Street ” and “ Jack Straw . ”
The mid-set “ Candyman ” was a full - room sing - along , with Kadlecik referencing the shimmering rotary - speaker sound that Jerry almost always used on that tune .
“ Viola Lee Blues ” cracked wide open into a far ranging jam , and was the evening ’s first nod to what must seem to many like the ancient history of The Dead .
The “ Truckin ' ” that followed and closed the set was perfectly mid-tempo , allowing the climactic jam at the end to truly build , accented by the evening ’s first real Phil thunder .
A fantastic beginning .
It was also really fascinating to listen to JK utilize different Jerry tones that we associate with disparate eras in the course of one tune , from slinky Europe ’ 72 Fender to the mid rangey MIDI - distortion of a ’ 93 “ Slipknot ! ”
Speaking of , the next set slammed wide open with a precise , sharp “ Help ” > “ Slip ” > “ Franklin ’s ” that joyously brought the room together , and what followed was , with just a few exceptions , a gorgeously drippy psychedelic excursion through “ Cassidy , ” “ The Wheel , ” “ Dark Star ” and perhaps most notably , Pink Floyd ’s “ Time ” from Dark Side of the Moon .
Unfortunately , this bold and inspired choice also contained the night ’s first major misstep , namely , Phil ’s vocal take , which was marred by pitch problems and that oddly square sense of rhythm he often applies to his vocal phrasing .
But the love in the room was so palpable at this point that no one seemed hung up on nitpicking , and we just continued flowing through a lovely “ Uncle John ’s ” and another surprise , “ After Midnight , ” delivered by JK with the fervor of an early 80s JGB version .
What a nice relief to have him lead the band through an exploratory set with truly narrative guitar playing , not separate , unrelated paragraphs of notes , but entire jams that felt as if they were one gesture , or breath .
Furthur :: 12.31 :: San Francisco
The entire New Year ’s moment ( or minutes ) seemed as delightfully disjointed and weirdly paced as any of the old BGP celebrations , with multiple layers of events going on simultaneously , including the New Year ’s baby rising out of a red fog - drenched cave , and then riding a very glam - inspired silver skull with red sequined eyes over the floor , while Father Time , children holding large DayGlo flowers , and ( if I remember correctly ) a collection of wood - nymph like creatures spread around the stage – all to the tune of The Beatle ’s “ All You Need is Love . ”
The countdown to 2010 sped by , balloons dropped , and everyone hugged and just hung out for a few minutes taking in the roar of the crowd and the crazy scene around us .
The next segment of music got underway not with the expected “ Sugar Magnolia ” but a perfect “ Golden Road to Unlimited Devotion ” that has been modernized and given some extra muscle , with an added rave - up at the end that seemed to take the place quite nicely of a “ Sugar Mag ” jam .
The entire third set was a marvel not just for the incredible energy expended , but for the inspired song choices , especially “ Let it Grow , ” which was as stately and majestic as it ’s ever been , particularly recontextualized as a New Year ’s letter between band and audience .
The “ Cryptical ” > “ Other One ” > “ Cryptical ” suite was pulled off with a panache that always seemed to elude The Dead .
The ballad slot was occupied by a gorgeous “ So Many Roads , ” and the whole thing was brought to an enormous conclusion with what was probably a half hour ’s worth of “ St. Stephen , ” “ The Eleven ” and “ Not Fade Away . ”
Lesh , Weir , Russo :: 12.31 :: San Francisco
After a few minutes of explosive appreciation from the packed house , Phil returned to the stage alone and said , “ Well , Happy New Year to you , too ! , ” which elicited another whole resounding level of heartfelt cheers .
Bobby then led the band into a charged “ Sugar Magnolia ” encore ( for the setlist geeks out there , a very unusual placement , but I think the band knew they could n’t get outta there without playing that ! ) and the evening came home perfectly and gracefully .
There has been a not oft - recognized bit of anxiety running through The Dead scene in recent years about whether the band is losing relevance – as evidenced by the many conversations I overheard about whether the Bill Graham Civic was sold out or not .
For years , even when The Dead and the scene were routinely disparaged in the mainstream press , heads could at least lean on the fact that “ their ” band sold out every show in every venue they played , and was continually the top - grossing live act in the country .
I can tell you this :
On the 30th , all but a VERY few upper tier seats were taken , and on New Year ’s , the place was packed to the gills .
More importantly , on both nights , NO ONE left these shows until the last note !
I get a little misty reflecting on years of New Year ’s throwdowns , a tradition virtually invented by Bill Graham and The Dead .
Watching the younger kids file stonily out of the venue with glazed , satiated looks , I was reassured that this music still communicates something essential , still allows the channeling of some energy that flows through the roots of the Haight - Ashbury and into deep space , and still needs to be performed in large darkened halls of dancing fools – sober , tripping , young , old , graceful , rude , beatific and impatient .
And I was reminded , proudly , that this band and this scene , albeit in a calmer , more diffuse stage , still gives any other contemporary act a run for its money .
This was not just another jam band New Year ’s show , this was one more deep reminder of the cultural importance of the Bay Area , and how lucky we are to celebrate it together once again .

He showed up for jail and left just as quickly .
The Maricopa County Sheriff ’s
Office says it is unable to book one of its own , detention officer Adam Stoddard , into jail tonight because of a supposed clerical error .
Stoddard apparently surrendered to the custody of his own agency in the past hour , but according to his attorney , the sheriff ’s office told him it could not book him because of some sort of error with the paperwork from the judge who sent him there .
“ The judge screwed up the order of confinement , ” said deputy county attorney Tom Liddy .
Liddy said the error was no fault of Stoddard or the sheriff ’s office .
“ He did self surrender , ” the attorney said .
“ He is in compliance with the order . ”
Stoddard was directed to jail after Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Gary Donahoe found him in contempt of court for a bizarre October incident in which he was caught on a courthouse security video slipping a confidential document from the file of a defense attorney .
Donahoe gave Stoddard the chance to avoid going to jail by apologizing to the defense attorney , but Stoddard has defied the judge and refused to say he ’s sorry .
Liddy said he was unclear what exactly the problem was tonight with the booking process , but he said it had something to do with the booking number .
Stoddard ’s attorney said he would go to the judge “ as soon as the court opens its doors ” in the morning to get the problem worked out so he can report for jail tomorow .

Canadians have been donating money to help the earthquake - ravaged country by the thousands .
From school bake sales to " text donations " to loonies and toonies dropped in corner store collection boxes , Canadians are donating by the thousands to help Haitians struggling in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake .
That flood of donations is setting Canadians apart , leading the world in providing aid to Haiti , giving almost $ 2 per person .
And today , Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to announce the federal government is upping its cap on matching contributions .
Ottawa had promised to match donations to the Haitian relief effort to a maximum of $ 50 million , effectively doubling individual donations to charities .
But with donations rapidly approaching that total , the federal government is poised to commit even more funding to earthquake relief efforts .
Harper praised Canadians Friday for their " compassion and generosity , " and implored everyone to give more .
" So widespread is the damage , so severe the destruction that much is needed , much more , " Harper said in a message that aired on a nationwide telethon .
" Our government is committed to matching every donation that Canadians make to relief organizations dollar for dollar , " he said .
U.S. President Barack Obama telephoned Harper on Friday and the two leaders agreed their countries would work closely on the immediate relief effort and longer - term help for Haiti , the Prime Minister 's Office said in a press release .
Earlier in the day , Harper sketched out the challenge facing Canada and other nations , calling the rebuilding of Haiti nothing less than the " rescue of a shattered society . "
Even before the quake , Haiti was the largest recipient of Canadian aid assistance in the Americas , with $ 555 million pledged for the period 2006 - 11 .
Michael Messenger , vice - president of public affairs for World Vision Canada , said Canadian donations to his organization are running ahead of those in other countries when measured per capita .
" We certainly have seen a very , very strong response this time .
It has really resonated with Canadians , " Messenger said .
" In World Vision offices around the world , we are certainly the highest per capita response to Haiti , " said Messenger , whose agency had raised $ 9.6 million in private donations by Friday morning .
The Canadian Red Cross says it 's collected $ 61 million for Haiti , $ 45 million of that from individual Canadians .
The rest comes from the federal government and corporations .
" Canadians have been incredibly generous , " said Heather Badenoch , an agency spokesperson .
Canadians are giving on a scale not seen since a tsunami in 2004 swept across Southeast Asia , killing 270,000 .

Donations will only grow in the days ahead as benefit concerts and other high - profile events encourage Canadians to open their wallets even more .
Charity organizers attribute the largesse to Canada 's long ties to the Caribbean nation – and technology .
Thanks to the Internet , people everywhere quickly understand the scale of the disaster , unlike the tsunami where the true impact was n't known for several days .
" Here , within hours , you had Twitter posts , with the photos people had snapped on cellphone cameras .
The average person had a pretty good idea just how massive this disaster was , " said Kieran Green , of CARE Canada .
And charities soon saw the impact .
" The very first week ... we were quite literally overwhelmed .
Our donation servers were crashing , our call centres were overloaded , " Green said .
Technology is also making it easier for Canadians to donate online ; 80 per cent of donations to the Red Cross are done online , or even by texting from a cellphone .
World Vision launched a challenge on Facebook encouraging people to give $ 10 and quickly saw their cyber - plea spread , Messenger said , adding " we just saw it showing up all over the place . "
That technology has put cash in the hands of aid agencies faster , which has helped speed their response .
Alexandra Lopoukhine , of Oxfam Canada , said the scale of the disaster has also made a difference in donations .

There were plenty of disappointed people when Hurricanes defenseman Tim Gleason was n't named to Team USA 's Olympic roster Jan. 1 following the Winter Classic in Boston .
Those in the Carolina organization were pulling for No. 6 .
The fans were hoping one of the RBC Center 's favorites would pull on the red , white and blue sweater in Vancouver .
Alas , Gleason was not selected .
To twist the knife , underperforming Kings blueliner Jack Johnson — the player Gleason was traded for at the start of the 2006 - 07 season — did make the grade and earned a spot on the American team .
Disappointing ?
For sure — but not shocking .
While it 's easy to make a case for Gleason over Johnson or others on the roster , there are also solid arguments for all the players who made the cut .
Even Brian Burke , the GM of the Toronto of Maple Leafs and the architect of the Team USA roster who left Gleason off the team , said in an interview with Chuck Kaiton that Gleason is " very much alive " if injuries should open up a spot on defense .
So the people who know hockey — including at least two GMs who have won Stanley Cups in recent years — know what Gleason brings to the table .
But that does n't mean everyone does .
Take The Hockey News ' Edward Fraser , for example .
This is n't meant to be an attack of Fraser 's article on the magazine 's site , which lists a B - Team for the United States — a complete second roster that somehow , someway omitted Gleason .
It 's more about the general lack of appreciation there is for Gleason around the league .
Zach Bogosian , Matt Carle , Andy Greene , Ron Hainsey , Rob Scuderi , Ryan Whitney and Keith Yandle are all decent choices for this second squad .
But right here , right now , none are better than Gleason .
Gleason does n't have the offensive skill of Whitney and Yandle , the size of Hainsey , or the rags - to - riches story of Scuderi or Greene .
He was n't part of the perhaps the best defenseman draft class ever like Bogosian , or have a Hall of Fame partner like Carle does .
Instead , most of what he does will not show up in score sheets and headlines — heart , determination , toughness , loyalty .
Sure , sometimes they do .
Look no further than the five penalty minutes he took fighting Daniel Carcillo early in the season following a dirty hit by the Flyers winger on Ray Whitney , or the shorthanded goal he registered after returning from some serious needlework to force overtime against division foe Washington .
But for the most part , Gleason 's contributions do n't find their way onto his profile page .
And because of that , he 's often under appreciated — hell , flat - out forgotten — when people outside of Raleigh talk about the up - and - coming blueliners in the game .
Such is the life of a heart - and - soul player , a guy who always puts the " we " ahead of the " me . "
Like Glen Wesley — the longtime Hurricanes defenseman who served as a mentor to Gleason when he arrived from Los Angeles — Carolina 's No. 6 is relegated to success in the shadows instead of the spotlight .
And he seems fine with that .
But I 'm not .
Gleason deserves the recognition .
As far as I 'm concerned , he 's setting himself up to be this generation 's Jason Smith .
Maybe he 'll get a shot to represent the United States next month in Vancouver , and perhaps then he 'll get more credit for all he brings to the Hurricanes .
But for now , let 's at least get him on the B - Team , OK Edward ?
Now , leaving Matt Cullen off the team in favor of Blake Wheeler ?
That makes me wonder if Fraser watches hockey or looks at stats .
For God ’s sake , blog !
Pope Benedict has told priests , saying they must learn to use new forms of communication to spread the gospel message .
In his message for the Roman Catholic Church ’s World Day of Communications on Saturday , the pope , who is 82 and known not to love computers or the internet , acknowledged priests must make the most of the “ rich menu of options ” offered by new technology .
“ Priests are thus challenged to proclaim the Gospel by employing the latest generation of audiovisual resources — images , videos , animated features , blogs , websites — which , alongside traditional means , can open up broad new vistas for dialogue , evangelization and catechesis , ” he said .

Stories of poor TSA security screenings are not new – several days ago we wrote about a man who passed through a Milwaukee checkpoint with shotgun shells .
In this “ TSA screw - up of the day ” , we head to Gallatin Field , serving Bozeman , Montana .
This may be a fairly small airport , but that should not be an excuse for the TSA to miss a firearm in a carry - on bag .
The gun belonged to an “ unidentified man ” , who was honest enough to notify the cabin crew when he noticed his error .
As is normally the case , the plane returned to the gate , and was delayed for over an hour while the TSA did their job ( again ) .
Now , I understand how our constant “ TSA bashing ” be be getting a little boring , but this story suddenly gets really interesting .
Airport director Brian Sprenger is so fed up with the government screeners , that he is seriously considering replacing them with an outside security firm .
Of course , a local union leader is “ strongly opposed ” , claiming for - profit security firms are a bad idea , because they ’ll need to make a profit , while working with the same budget offered to the TSA .
But to be honest , I do n’t see how a private firm could be any worse than the government workers in place right now .
Failing to detect a gun is the kind of mistake that could cost the lives of everyone on the plane .
Too much emphasis is placed on items like water bottles and false no - fly list passengers , that you sometimes get the feeling they forget to keep a close eye on the most obvious issues .
There are no immediate plans to replace the TSA at Bozeman just yet – but the airport is in the exploratory phase , which on its own should set off some alarm bells within government .
Check out these other stories from the airport checkpoint !

There is an irony in Sen.
Joseph Lieberman 's stalwart opposition to any form of a healthcare public option :
The state he represents , Connecticut , approved a statewide public health insurance system with a public option this year .
Anger at Senator Lieberman 's stance in some quarters of the state is such that state Rep. Rosa DeLauro declared that he “ ought to be recalled . ”
In fact , Connecticut has no mechanism for recalling senators – and would be unlikely to recall Lieberman even if it did , says Douglas Schwartz , a pollster who has conducted surveys in Connecticut about Lieberman .
Residents know that he “ has already moved toward the right on a number of high profile issues , " Dr. Schwartz says .
But there is little question that Lieberman is out of step with this state .
Though Connecticut is not a liberal bastion like Washington , D.C. , or Hawaii , it is a blue state that trends Democratic .
“ I would expect that in 2012 , a Democratic senatorial candidate running against Lieberman is going to make this a primary aspect of his or her campaign , and Democratic voters are going to be receptive to that sort of criticism , " says Doug Foyle , a political scientist at Wesleyan University in Middletown , Conn. , who puts the left - right split in Connecticut at 55 percent to 45 percent .
Lieberman 's stand
In recent days , Lieberman has said he would refuse to vote for a government run healthcare public option or for a Medicare buy - in program that would act like a public option .
Though Lieberman is an independent , he is a part of the Democratic caucus , and the Democrats need his vote – or the vote of one Republican – to avoid a filibuster on healthcare reform .
The result has been the apparent end of the public option .
Connecticut , however , has displayed strong support for universal healthcare .
The Legislature passed a bill calling for the creation of a statewide public health insurance system this year .
When Republican Gov. Jodi Rell vetoed the bill , the Connecticut House and Senate had enough votes to override the veto .
The plan , called SustiNet , includes a public option .
" People happy with their private health insurance plans are free to keep them , " wrote Juan Figueroa , president of the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut , in the Hartford Courant in July , using words reminiscent of the national debate .
" But the new public option will offer a more affordable choice to many people , such as those with preexisting conditions , who are currently locked out of the private market . "
No surprises
Yet polling data suggest that Connecticut voters are unlikely to be too angry with Lieberman .
After Lieberman first announced his opposition to the pubic option this fall , a study by Quinnipiac University Poll found that Connecticut voters approved of how Lieberman was handling his job , 49 to 44 percent .
More specifically , 64 percent said that even if Lieberman was involved in a filibuster of the Democratic healthcare plan , he ought to keep his chairmanship of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee .
“ The public option is popular in Connecticut , but people did n’t care enough about it to affect their opinion of Lieberman , ” says Schwartz , director of Quinnipiac University Poll .
In short , the people of Connecticut are already well acquainted with Lieberman 's ways .
“ I would n’t expect his numbers to move that much , ” says Professor Foyle .
“ His opposition to [ the public option ] is n’t telling anyone anything new about Joe Lieberman . "
Mr. Figueroa of the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut disagrees .
“ People are really , really outraged that he is playing the worst kind of politics , ” said Figueroa , who worked as an assistant district attorney when Lieberman ’s was attorney general of Connecticut .
“ It is one more indication of how Lieberman is so out of tune with the people in this state . ”
Or , perhaps , with Democrats .
In an interview with CNN Tuesday , Lieberman raised new questions about his political future if he chooses to run in 2012 .
“ It ’s unlikely that I would run as a Republican , but I would n’t foreclose any possibility , ” he said .
Israel –
The brazen assassination of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh has thrown the spotlight on one of Israel ’s most powerful but shadowy figures , Meir Dagan , the current Mossad chief , who yesterday faced calls for his resignation .
There is a piece of folklore often repeated about him : when he was appointed in 2002 , Ariel Sharon , then the Prime Minister , ordered him to run the Israeli spy agency “ with a knife between its teeth ” .
Eight years on , Mr Dagan appears to have followed his orders to the letter .
The killing in Dubai of one of the top men in Hamas is only the most recent in a string of assassinations that have been traced to Mr Dagan .
His popular support in Israel has never been higher , as most Israelis approach the allegations that Mossad is behind the Dubai death with a wink and a smile .
While senior officials in the Israeli Foreign Ministry fume over the diplomatic mess , caused by the implications of the Dubai assassinations , those who know Mr Dagan say that he is nonplussed by the row .
“ He is a determined street fighter , ” said Amir Oren , a military correspondent for the Israeli daily Haaretz .
The thickset , soft - spoken Mr Dagan was twice wounded in more than 30 years of service in the Israel Defence Forces , but he avoids walking with a cane .
He has served as head of Israel ’s Counter - Terrorism Bureau , and became a close confident of Mr Sharon during their years together in the IDF .
Mr Dagan ’s predecessor , British - born Ephraim Halevy , was known for a more conservative approach to the Mossad , Mr Oren said .
Mr Halevy focused instead on strengthening Mossad ’s relationship with similar agencies in other countries .
“ When Dagan took over he said the Mossad had become too risk - averse , and took its sweet time organizing itself for operations , ” said Mr Oren .
“ Dagan , meanwhile , is not trying to come across as diplomatically elegant . ”
Maintaining good relations with other nations was dropped to the bottom of the list , said “ B ” a former Mossad agent who worked under Mr Dagan .
“ Mossad is facing a lot of anger right now over the use of British and European passports .
I do n’t know if Mossad was actually involved or how they got those passports though I can say that Dagan is n’t the kind of man to care about angering a few people to get the job done . ”
“ B ” said that Mr Dagan had a no - nonsense approach and did not like to be questioned or second - guessed .
“ He is what you would call a one - man show , ” he said .
Talk of Dagan ’s unwillingness to share power with others surfaced early in his tenure , when the Jerusalem Post reported that more than 200 Mossad agents had quit their posts over Mr Dagan ’s style .
In June 2009 , when his term as Mossad chief was extended by one year by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , one of his seconds in command promptly quit .
While some Israelis , including Mr Oren , have argued that Mr Dagan should resign his position over the loud public furore surrounding the Dubai assassinations – though Israel has not admitted its involvement in this , or any other mission – most are pleased with Mr Dagan ’s tenure .
“ Mossad have renewed the aura that the name Mossad used to generate in the region , ” Alon Ben David , an Israeli intelligence analyst , told Israeli radio , a statement that was promptly echoed by the presenter .
Mr Dagan ’s popularity was first strengthened by the Mossad ’s rumoured involvement in the assassination of Hezbollah security chief Imad Mughniyah in February 2008 .
Talk of other killings of senior Hezbollah and Hamas officials began to spread .
An alleged strike by Israeli planes on Syrian targets in September 2007 was also credited to him , part of his focus on nuclear weapons programmes in the Middle East .
Mr Netanyahu ’s insistence that Mr Dagan stay on for an additional year was said to stem from his unparalleled knowledge of Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
While Israel ’s military leaders traditionally serve for four years , with a one - year extension , Mr Dagan ’s tenure has been extended twice .
His budgetary allowance is also one of the largest , said a member of the Knesset ’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee – leading to a near doubling of the Mossad ’s Tel Aviv offices since 2002 .
Google Books has provided me endless hours of enjoyment .
Sure , the collection seems to consist mainly of old , out of copyright books , but that makes it even more enticing .
It is like a fine used - book store , without the musty smell .
Imagine .
It is late at night , and the library is closed and Amazon cannot deliver fast enough .
But you absolutely must have immediate access to Kramer and Sprenger ’s witch - hunting manual , the Malleus Maleficarum , specifically the 1669 Lyon edition .
What do you do ?
A quick search of Google Books , and there you have it , in full text , with the ability to download it in PDF if you want .
What you do with the “ Hammer of Witches ” is your own business .
But who would n’t have a little extra bounce in their step knowing they have a copy tucked away on their USB memory stick , “ just in case ” ?
And so , I was browsing through “ many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore ” when I came across a book with the imposing title The Moral Aspects of Medical Life , Consisting of the ‘ Akesios ’ of K.F.H. Marx , translated from the German with Biographical Notes and Illustrative Remarks by James Mackness , M.D. , published in London in 1846 .
Note that this is by Karl Friedrich Heinrich Marx ( 1796 - 1877 ) , the German physician , not to be confused with the founder of modern communism Karl Heinrich Marx ( 1818 - 1893 ) .
Within this text is printed a most remarkable diagram , “ A Moral and Physical Thermometer ” .
A footnote ascribes it to another work , ’Public Characters ’ , London , 1801 , pg 499 .
In any case here it is , a marvelous example of data presentation and visualization from 200 years ago .
It shows , in parallel scales , the strength of various drinks as well as their effects .
Now , mind you that this diagram is coming from an advocate of water drinking , but it is an interesting view of the state of drink in 1801 London .
A few things stand out :
Cider ( to American readers ) is non-alcoholic .
Here it apparently refers to hard cider .
Perry is like hard cider , only made from pears .
Do n’t see much of that around here .
Why is wine listed as weaker than porter and great beer ?
Today porter is 5 % ABV or so , while wine is 12 % or so .
And even strong beers today are 6 - 7 % ABV .
So were things so much different back in 1801 ?
Or is the chart correlated with the social stigma attached to the drink , and not necessarily the potency of the drink ?
Some of the drinks are obscure today , in particular toddy ( any hot , spiced drink , like mulled cider ) , crank ( unknown — not listed in the OED ) , flip ( eggnog - like drinks ) and shrub ( lemon juice and rum )
Hysteric Water — we may forget that the root word here is from the Greek “ hystera ” , meaning uterus .
It was thought that hysteria was predominately a disorder of women , and was treated by various means , including “ Hysteric Water ” , which according to one period recipe was brandy infused with medicinal herbs : valerian , pennyroyal , rue , mugwort , savin , orange peel , and lovage .
It was taken in small doses : 1 ounce .
So why is Hysteric Water listed as the worst of the lot , the one where drinking it leads one to risk whipping or exile to the Australian penal colony of Botany Bay ?
Perhaps there was some additional social stigma attached .
One period commenter described the state of affairs like this :
Many a good woman , who would start at the very mention of strong waters , cannot conceive there can be any harm in a cordial .
And as the fair sex are more particularly subject to a depression of spirits , it is no wonder that they should convert their apothecaries ’ shops into rich cordial warehouses , and take drams by way of physic ; as the common people make gin serve for meat , drink , and clothes .
The ladies perhaps may not be aware , that every time they have recourse to their Hartshorn or Lavender Drops , to drive away the vapours , they in effect take a dram ; and they may be assured , that their Colic , Surfeit , and plague Waters , are to be ranked among spirituous liquors , as well as the common stuff at the gin-shop .
The college of Physicians , in their last review of the London Dispensatory , for this very reason expelled the Strong Water , generally known by the soothing name of Hysteric Water ; because it was a lure to the female sex to dram it by authority , and to get tipsy secundum artem .
If any of my fair readers have at all given into this pernicious practice of dram - drinking , I must intreat them to leave it off betimes , before it has taken such hold of them , as they can never shake off .
For the desire of drams steals upon them , and grows to be habitual , by imperceptible degrees : as those who are accustomed to take opiates , are obliged to encrease the dose gradually , and at last cannot sleep without it .
But it is comforting to know that then , as today , a moderate beer is still good for “ reputation , long life and happiness ” .
During his eight years in office , President Bush oversaw a large increase in government spending .
In fact , President Bush increased government spending more than any of the six presidents preceding him , including LBJ .
In his last term in office , President Bush increased discretionary outlays by an estimated 48.6 percent .
During his eight years in office , President Bush spent almost twice as much as his predecessor , President Clinton .
Adjusted for inflation , in eight years , President Clinton increased the federal budget by 12.5 percent .
In eight years , President Bush increased it by a whopping 53 percent .
One reason offered for these large budget increases is that entitlement programs are growing rapidly .
Although Social Security and Medicare spending growth outpaced most other programs in the mid-1990s , spending growth in discretionary programs has accelerated in the last 15 years , especially during Bush ’s two terms .
Between FY2002 and FY2009 , discretionary spending rose 96 percent .
Some argue that federal spending during the Bush years was so high because security needs drove up the budget .
It is true that defense spending increased dramatically since the late - 1990s , particularly since 9/11 and the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
However , nondefense spending increased too .
Some also argue that much of the increase in nondefense spending stemmed from increases in homeland security spending .
Whether this is true , the overall rapid rise of discretionary spending indicates that , here too , the administration and Congress made no trade - offs in the budget .
If the administration and Congress wanted more security spending and wanted to be fiscally responsible , they should have found savings elsewhere in the budget .
President Bush added thousands of new federal subsidy programs during his eight years in office .
In 2008 , there were 1,816 subsidy programs in the federal budget that spread hundreds of billions of dollars annually to special interest groups such as state governments , businesses , nonprofit groups , and individuals .
The number of subsidy programs has grown by 30 percent since 2000 and by 54 percent since 1990 .

Syria ’s economics , history , politics , diplomacy , and culture have often been defined in a large part by water .
This has been the case since this area was part of the Eblan civilization , or about 2500 BC , onward .
But let ’s look at some more recent facts and events .
About 30 percent of Syria ’s labor force works in agriculture .
About one - third of its land is cultivatable .
Only one - fourth of that land is irrigated .
Much of the irrigation is done in somewhat wasteful ways that has much of the precious water pouring past the crops .
Farmers have subsidized energy and also have a yearly flat rate payment for irrigation water .
This rate does not even get near to true costs of the water they use .
Hence , water is overused , much more land is becoming saline , and water tables are being drawn down in some places at a fast rate .
Wells by law need to be licensed , but the rule of law in Syria is sometimes not the letter of the law .
Some of the fields are irrigated with wastewater , but not in a way one would hope .
Some of this wastewater is untreated .
Some of the farmers and others say this reduces the need for fertilizers .
By law this wastewater cannot be used for irrigating vegetables that will not be cooked , but it surely must be adding to the health problems in the country in some way .
The government has been putting a lot of effort and money into improving wastewater treatment in general , but it does not seem to be keeping up with the growing problems .
Wastewater infrastructure development seems lacking .
Even so , Syrian cities reuse a lot of the treated wastewater .
Syria seems to understand the water problems it faces , but it also seems to be slowly getting up to speed to solve them .
The government has been putting some efforts into diffusing new irrigation technologies and starting a group of water management departments and organizations .
It is also putting pressure on the farmer ’s unions , which in Syria are government organizations to get people to handle the water better .
However , very little progress is really being made compared to the problems the country faces .
Syria ’s agricultural policy aims to achieve self - sufficiency in food and agricultural inputs to industry , such as textiles and food processing .
The government often buys agricultural products from the farmers at higher than international prices and it subsidizes many inputs for farmers , including water .
This prompts many farmers to grow even more , stressing out land and water systems even more so .
Syria ’s main export crop is cotton , which is a water - intensive crop .
Others of its main crops include wheat and barley , also water intensive crops .
Syria has a significant trade in fruits and vegetables .
This may help the bottom line for Syrian food “ self - sufficiency ” , but these are far from long term rational decisions .
It might make a lot more sense to focus on virtual water imports for the water - intensive crops and for the farmers and others to switch their economic decisions toward less water - using crops .
But this will not happen until the mostly still socialist , centrally - planned economic and political system of Syria either changes its incentives or starts to open up to the actual resource costs of water .
Syria ’s population growth rate is close to 3 percent .
Its population has doubled since the mid-1980s .
Syria ’s population growth rate is close to 3 percent .
Its population has doubled since the mid-1980s .
Its agricultural needs for water have greatly increased , which has been exacerbated by the import - substitution polices of the country .
Water needs for industry , commerce and households have also increased , but close to 85 percent of Syria ’s water use is for agriculture .
Syria ’s rapid population growth rate also generates greater electrical needs .
Hydropower used to be the dominant source of electricity in the country in the early 1980s .
Given the limitations of water resources for energy in the country , mostly from the Euphrates , more thermal power stations , also heavy water “ drinkers ” , have been and are being built .
Many stations have been and are being converted toward using natural gas more than oil , given the declining oil fortunes of the country .
However , the thermal power station building has not been keeping up with the declining fortunes of hydropower in the country .
One of the more delicate reasons for this decline in hydropower has been the change in the flows of the most important external water source for Syria : the great Euphrates River .
The Euphrates gets its water initially in the Taurus Mountain in Turkey , and then flows through the massive GAP project in Turkey .
The GAP project has been using more and more of the water of the Euphrates to irrigate crops and for the production of electricity to produce jobs and prosperity in the southeastern part of Turkey .
This part of Turkey , which has mostly Kurdish population , has been one of the poorest and most restive parts of the country .
The Kurdish populations of Turkey , Iraq and Syria live within a certain proximity to each other .
There may be issues here in the future , particularly when one considers the Iraqi Kurds ’ desires to have even greater autonomy .
Another difficulty are the lives of the Syrian Kurds , who reside in a state that some in their community say does not given them their due nationality , economic or cultural rights .
The Kurds of northeastern Syria could be an increasing source of instability if certain changes are not made to their economy and more .
The Turks see part of the solution to their Kurdish problem to involve developing a mostly Kurdish region in the southeastern part of the country .
The Turks are also the largest investors in the Kurdish regions of Iraq for similar reasons .
They want a more prosperous Kurdish part of Iraq , given that prosperity might reduce the chances of these Kurds pushing separatism more and also dragging the Turkish Kurds into their separatist efforts .
All three of these Kurdish areas will need more water to produce this increased prosperity and peace .
But the Euphrates only has so much water and Turkey seems to be holding all of the most important cards on the table at the moment .
Turkey also has very different definitions and claims to the water of the Euphrates than the Iraqis and the Syrians are willing to fully accept .
The water flows from Turkey through Syria and then on to Iraq .
Some long term wise agreements on economic , energy and irrigation development and on water sharing and water trade will be needed , but these may not happen any time soon .
These are very sensitive issues across these countries and have been for decades .
As things stand now , it is not possible , given the water flows of the river , to have all parties satisfied and tensions are building .
The improving relations between Syria and Turkey may alleviate these tensions at the national and higher levels , but at the farmer and village levels they are growing in Syria and in Iraq .
The Tigris River also defines the northeastern tip of the border between Syria and Turkey .
The Tigris runs along this border and then flows immediately into Iraq .
The Tigris River Basin waters in these border areas are used by Syria , Turkey and Iraq .
Underground aquifers are “ shared ” by these three important countries .
No real agreements have been signed regarding these underground waters .
There is a Joint Trilateral Committee that is supposed to be looking into better ways of sharing the water .
The vicious droughts that have ravaged Iraq and Syria in recent years , especially the ones in 2008 and 2009 , have further brought to light the importance of water for this region .
Hundreds of thousands of people in Syria and Iraq had to leave their lands because there was not enough rain and other sources of water to make living on them even subsistence any more .
Indeed , Syria has been hit very hard by droughts .
These droughts are a devastating issue for many of the farmers and other rural people in the country .
The drought and the decreased flows of the Euphrates and other rivers in Syria have also led to severe water shortages in some urban and semi-urban areas .
Aleppo , a city in northern Syria , has been facing severe water shortages , for example .
There is a project to send the waters from the Euphrates to Aleppo , but , again , there is only so much water in the Euphrates to use and share .
About 75 percent of the people in Syria are urban or semi-urban dwellers .
Out of the 20 million who live in this drying country , eight million can be found in Damascus and Aleppo .
These cities may be facing some very serious sustainability issues due to water in the not too distant futures .
The Barada River , the main river of Damascus , is hardly what it used to be due to droughts , pollution , and overuse .
When the Israelis captured the Golan Heights and the Mount Hermon area , they also gained control over the banks and access to the Sea of Galilee as well as much of the headwaters of the Jordan River .
The Yarmouk River , which acts as a border with Syria and Jordan in places is also a border of the Golan , hence making this important tributary to the Jordan River a vital source of dispute for Syria and Israel .
The Hasbani River flows in from Lebanon to Israel , but also along the edges of the Golan .
The Banias River originates at Mount Hermon .
The Dan River originates at Mount Hermon .
By controlling the Golan Israel controls the tributaries and sources of water for the Jordan River and the Jordan River Basin watershed .
Water issues also involve the ownership and resolution of the dispute over Shebaa Farms , which is just opposite to the Golan , and has water underground and flowing over it .
Negotiations and disputes between Syria and Israel have often been about water .
The wars and other conflicts between these two nations has often revolved around water , both above and below ground .
Syria ’s and Israel ’s interests in Lebanon also include interests in Lebanese water and this is much more than just the Shebaa Farms .
The water flows from Syria and Lebanon south to Israel and the Occupied Territories .
However , as is well known , much of that water flow is diverted for Israeli use .
Some of the water in Lebanon that flows from the Orontes River travels through Syria to Turkey .
The place where it flows out into the Mediterranean is called Samandag , which is in the Hatay Province of Turkey .
This province has been a source of dispute between Turkey and Syria .
Part of the dispute has been over water , not just land .
This dispute seems to have taken a back seat to the gradually improving relations between the two countries and the greater source of water - induced political stress , the Euphrates .
However , as water tensions mount , especially in the northwestern part of Syria , where this river is important , then these international tensions might come back .
One of Israel ’s main goals is to have hydrological security .
The same could be said of Syria as well as Jordan , Lebanon , and Iraq , which also share some of their water sources with Syria .
And , of course , we cannot forget the Israeli - Palestinian issues that revolve around water .
Much of that water also comes originally from the Golan and from the tributaries and other sources of water for the Jordan River Basin .
The water flows from Syria and Lebanon south to Israel and the Occupied Territories .
However , as is well known , much of that water flow is diverted for Israeli use .
This is a huge source of tension in a water - stressed area .
The Israeli -Palestinian water disputes are for a later article , but it is important to note here that they are intimately connected to the Syrian - Israeli , Lebanese - Israeli and Jordanian - Israeli water disputes .
So , as usual in this critical , but brittle region , many issues are interconnected in many complex and sometimes unpredictable ways .
As the populations and water needs of these countries grow , tensions will likely rise .
Some of the fault lines , which also often can be seen as rivers and aquifers , will become either more of a battle zone of more of negotiation space .
Which way these go will determine war and peace , prosperity and poverty , and life and death for many .
So we have seen waters , wars , wheat , watts , waste part of this story .
What about the wasta ?
Wasta is the Arabic term for connections and clout .
The story of water within Syria and between Syria and its neighbors has been about clout .
Israel has the clout with its powerful military and intelligence services , and , of course , the support of the U.S. Turkey has the clout with its economic , military and other power .
Syria , however , has much less clout than the Israelis and the Turks on water issues .
It has more wasta than the Lebanese , but even this seems to be changing .
The Palestinians are left in the dry not only because they lack relative wasta , but also because of the upstream disputes , which are also about relative wasta .
Where will this all lead us ?
Without more efficient use of water , increased desalinization , better cropping patterns , and better incentives for water use within Syria and within the entire region , we are going to face more wars , more destruction , and more deaths .
We could also face more insurgencies and asymmetric violence in Syria and across the Eastern Mediterranean .
Water is a key to peace .
It is also a weapon and purpose of war .
These issues , most particularly those between the Syrians and the Israelis , need to be resolved in a much wiser and quicker way than they have been so far .
Otherwise , the region might be boiling once again .
This time around the region is much more brittle and this time non-state actors could be a much bigger part of things and things really could spin out of control in many ways .
Water is a key to peace and prosperity .
It is also a key to war and conflict .
The Syrians and their neighbors surely understand this better than most .

An artist 's impression of the new Madrid Street development in east Belfast where central heating systems will be " redundant "
Dozens of new homes will be so energy efficient that they are to be built without central heating systems , those behind a new venture have announced .
More than 50 social housing properties will be constructed over the next three years in the scheme which is led by Habitat for Humanity Northern Ireland .
They said each house will be 75 % more energy efficient than average as it will be built using advanced technology from local firm Tyrone Timberframes .
The first phase begins in east Belfast .
' Future proof '
The £ 5 m project was said to mark the first time across the UK and Ireland that houses in the social housing sector have been built without the requirement of a central heating system .
We have created a technology which produces significant energy savings and slashes running costs for the homeowner
David Maxwell , Tyrone Timberframes
The partnership claimed that when completed , the housing development would " future proof " new homes against adverse energy costs and address the impact of fuel poverty .
Construction is set to begin shortly at Madrid Street and the first completed houses will cost in the region of £ 100,000 .
People who want to live in the properties will have to get their hands dirty though .
Habitat for Humanity is a Christian organisation which helps families to build their own homes , with the help of volunteers .
The entire project will require 84,000 hours of volunteer time .
Heat recovery
The properties will be made air - tight and will be fitted with triple - glazed windows .
They will also contain a " whole house ventilation " system which will recover at least 80 % of the heat from stale air in the home and redistribute it into a supply of fresh filtered air .
David Maxwell and Peter Farquharson launched the £ 5 m housing investment The executive director of Habitat for Humanity in Northern Ireland , Peter Farquharson , said the ambitious plan would " fundamentally change how people view new homes " and have a " far - reaching impact for the community and the sector " .
Tyrone Timberframes has produced energy efficient timber frame houses for the the self build market over the past number of years but this is the first time their products have been used in the construction of social housing .
The company 's managing director , David Maxwell , said the firm was excited about the " enormous potential " of the scheme .
" We envisaged some time ago that the house of the future will be environmentally friendly and highly energy efficient , " he added .
" As a result of investing in research and development we have created a technology which produces significant energy savings and slashes running costs for the homeowner . "

In the latest round of non-news for the upcoming Star Trek sequel , Nestor Carbonell ( who we loving refer to as Batmanuel ) says that he would " be thrilled " to play Khan in the next movie .
" Well , it would be tremendous , it would be amazing , " Says Carbonell .
" I know that [ ' Lost ' ] has already opened many doors for me , and that 's the great thing about this business , that you never know which job you do will help you out with other jobs .
This show has given me and my family so much , so if that were to happen , it would be tremendous . "
Nestor has been in previous J.J. Projects , like Lost and apparently has lots of support from fans concerning Khan .
He even talks about how his pecs could live up to Ricardo Montalban's .
Ha , I say !
Those would be some big space vests to fill .
" Listen , all modesty aside , I 'm pretty shredded right now , " Laughs Carbonell .
" Richard may not get to flex his muscles , but he 's not averse to taking off his shirt .
Should it happen , the fans will know . "
Speaking of his role on Lost .
We may be in the minority here , but we 're not 100 % sold on the Khan idea .
Let 's wait and see what Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have to offer .
Who knows , maybe the new film will be based around the TOS episode " Miri " .
If that 's the case , we'd be cool with Carbonell playing a grup .

Twitter is calling in the help of BitTorrent to deploy files across its many servers in a more efficient way .
The project dubbed ' Murder ' is based on the Open Source BitTornado BitTorrent client .
Aside from assisting Twitter it is available to other developers at no cost .
Large scale web - services such as Twitter need thousands of servers to manage the flow of updates that are sent out by their millions of users .
As a result , keeping all these servers updated with the latest data can be time and resource intensive .
To improve the deployment of files across their servers , Twitter is calling in the help of BitTorrent .
With BitTorrent , Twitter is planning to distribute files faster and more efficiently , saving time and precious resources and improving the scalability of Twitter ’s operation .
Twitter ’s new project , codenamed ‘ Murder ’ , will not use the bandwidth of Twitter users .
Instead , it will transform the site ’s servers into a large BitTorrent swarm that will distribute file updates using BitTorrent technology .
The setup is pretty straightforward .
Murder uses a ‘ seeder ’ server where the new files will be distributed to thousands of ‘ peer ’ servers .
Because all servers assist in the deployment of the files , it will only take a fraction of the time it would otherwise take when files are distributed from a central server .
This server - to - server BitTorrent technology also explains the name ‘ Murder ’ which is used to describe a flock of crows .
The Murder project is developed by Twitter ’s Larry Gadea and built based on the BitTornado BitTorrent client , which was the first client to implement web - seeding .
The code is open to the public and licensed under the free software Apache License .
Eric Klinker , CEO of BitTorrent Inc. is excited about Twitter ’s adoption of BitTorrent .
“ We are thrilled to collaborate with them on this and hope that more Web Monsters out there look to this and other applications of BitTorrent in solving some of the hard problems of the Internet , ” he said .
“ The distributed nature of BitTorrent means an operation that once took many dozens of minutes , now happens in less than a dozen seconds .
These efficiencies will reduce maintenance windows , site downtime and exposure to security vulnerabilities , ” Klinker added .
Although Klinker speaks about “ collaboration ” with Twitter it is not clear what role BitTorrent Inc. will play in the Murder project .
At this point it is still unclear when Murder will be implemented or released to the public but Twitter is expected to release more details on the upcoming project in the weeks to come .
X -ray machines are used at UK airports
Enlarge Image
Leaked documents said to have been drawn up by the Home Office and seen by the Sun newspaper say cameras which can see through clothes could be built into lamp posts to " trap terror suspects " .
While Home Secretary John Reid has denied knowledge of the plans , the technology is not dissimilar to that already found in some UK airports .
Currently , air security officials pick out individuals to stand in a booth while three pictures are taken of the person in slightly different positions .
Within seconds , an X - ray scanner produces an image of the body , minus the clothes .
What shows up is the naked human form and anything that may be concealed on the person , such as coins , a gun or drugs .
The real question is not whether the technology can see something under the clothing , it 's how you respond to it
Bob Ayers
Security expert
There are other variations on the X - ray technology .
Millimetre wave machines give more of a three - dimensional image , while terahertz radiation also penetrates clothing .
A one - month trial at London 's Paddington rail station involved a millimetre wave scanner .
A portable version - an " electronic wand " - was trialled last year at London 's Canary Wharf and Greenford Underground stations .
No decision has been made about wider implementation , according to a Department of Transport spokesman , who says the challenges are being evaluated .
But security expert Bob Ayers , of Chatham House , believes putting an X - ray lens on a lamppost poses all sorts of resource questions .
X -rays have been used on people traffickers
" Some guy walks past and his picture is beamed back to a control room to say that something is under his jacket .
What do you do ?
Despatch a police car to hunt him down and frisk him ?
" The real question is not whether the technology can see something under the clothing .
It 's how you respond to it when the technology says there 's something unusual .
" Do you have police strolling down each street , ready to ask people what they have under their jacket ? "
Privacy
The manpower cost would be " astronomical " , he says , and CCTV would be required to match a description to the suspicious image .
" If you do n't pick them up in minute or two , he 's gone .
What good does it do for you to know that at 11 am this morning a guy walked down Victoria Street with a gun in his jacket ? "
Besides , there could be problems distinguishing a money bag from a bomb strapped at the waist .
But privacy should not be a concern because there is only a shadowy outline of the body , says Mr Ayers .
Fears have been raised about intrusive pictures
Professor Paul Wilkinson , a terrorism expert , is also doubtful .
There would be a huge installation and maintenance cost , he says , plus the risk of antagonising ordinary citizens .
" The practicalities of these things working , if sufficient light , is in no doubt .
The questions are when is this a useful addition to security and when does it become unduly intrusive and worrying to the public ? "
What works for airline security , where passengers expect thorough checks , would not necessarily be tolerated when walking down the street , he adds .
Mr Ayers believes the best use of this technology is in a captured space , like at airport security or in a bus depot .
A spokesman for Qinetiq , one of the first firms to develop millimetre wave machines , says there have been successful uses for them .
" The Immigration Service has about eight or nine deployed around Europe , to see lorries crossing the Channel or at sea crossings into the UK .
" Using this technology alongside complementary technology such as CO2 monitors , they have detected thousands of people stashed away on lorries . "
He adds that the US military are trialling millimetre wave machines at military checkpoints to combat the threat of suicide bombers .
The use of cables mean they can be operated from any distance .
Given the abuse of CCTV images , how can one be sure that scans will not be misused ?
At minimum there has to be clear notification whenever such a scanner is in use : scanning without consent is an invasion of privacy .
Megan , Cheshire UK
No doubt there will be people who will claim this is an invasion of civil liberties , I wonder how they would feel the same way if their plane was hi-jacked ?
James Sergeant , Lancing , UK
This is an excellent product and as a member of the British army would like to see it put in its proper place :
Out on the front line with the soldiers that are on the ground .
As for the privacy issue , if you have nothing to hide what is the problem ?

As a boy I remember every shoe shop had free X - ray machines to show your feet in your selected shoes .
These were withdrawn when medical science belatedly became aware of the dangers of receiving to many X - rays .
KR , Bangkok , Thailand
I went through one of these scanners at the airport when they were trialling them at Heathrow .
I obviously did n't know what it was and had nothing to hide so I agreed .
Tempted by the fast track they promised through security .
They asked me if I wanted to see the image afterwards , which I agreed as I was intrigued .
What I saw horrified me , it was literally a stripped bare me on the screen !
I 'm all for safety and measures against tourism but regularly being " strip searched " in effect walking down the street is another thing .

Race advisers and equality campaigners have called on the government to make " anonymous " CVs and job applications compulsory to overcome discrimination against women and people with African or Asian surnames .
Some British companies have already begun stripping out personal details so those deciding who to invite for interview are only told about their qualifications and experience , and not their ethnicity , gender or age .
The government 's ethnic minority taskforce is due to report in the new year on the findings of research commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions which uncovered widespread racial discrimination against workers with African and Asian names .
In France , a group of 50 firms and local governments is beginning a government - led test of recruitment via anonymous CVs , under which information such as names , age , sex , date and place of birth , nationality and marital status will be banned .
Jeremy Crook , the vice chair of the Ethnic Minority Advisory Group and the Black Training and Enterprise Group , said such a move would be a step forward in the UK .
" We know from the recent research evidence that there is discrimination in applications , and in particular CVs and where names are prevalant , " he said .
" A lot of people are n't even getting to the door . "
Ashok Viswanathan , the deputy co-ordinator of Operation Black Vote , said : " Anything that makes selection proportionate to people 's skills rather than their ethnicity would be a move forward . "
Tom Hadley , of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation , said he had seen a growing trend towards anonymity .
" A lot of companies are doing it to cover themselves in case candidates claim there 's been discrimination , " he said .
" We 've seen it particular with agencies who work with public sector organisations or with blue chip companies who are quite ahead of the game in terms of diversity and equality . "
For the last two years , BP has been removing all the personal background detail from the applications for the 160 graduate positions it awards each year .
" We do it to make it as much a meritocracy as possible , " a spokesman said .
Researchers commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions sent nearly 3,000 applications for 987 vacancies under false identities , using the names Nazia Mahmood , Mariam Namagembe and Alison Taylor .
Each had similar experience and qualifications , and had British education and work histories .
But the results , published earlier this year , showed that applicants who appeared to be white had to send nine applications before receiving an invitation to interview or an encouraging telephone call while candidates with the " foreign " sounding names had to send 16 applications before receiving a similar response .
The vacancies the researchers from the National Centre for Social Research applied for were in nine occupations , ranging from accountants and IT technicians to care workers and sales assistants , and based in Birmingham , Bradford , Bristol , Glasgow , Leeds , London and Manchester .
A spokeswoman for the government 's equalities office said : " The taskforce will be meeting in January and we are waiting to hear the taskforce 's recommendations about the findings in their report before any further decisions are made . "

Formula 1 has edged closer to a further overhaul of its points structure for the 2010 season after teams approved a new system that will offer greater rewards for winning , AUTOSPORT can reveal .
Just more than one month after the old 10 - 8- 6-5-4-3- 2- 1 system was replaced with a MotoGP - type format ( 25-20-15-10-8-6-5-3 - 2 - 1 ) , sources have revealed a meeting of F1 think tank the Sporting Working Group in London on Friday approved a further overhaul to reward more for race wins .
Rather than there being a five points different between first and second , teams agreed to expand that difference to seven points - with further tweaks to the points taking place lower down the order .
The new points structure approved by the SWG is : 25-18-15-12-10-8-6-4-2-1 .
The matter still needs to be approved by next month 's meeting of the Formula 1 Commission before the FIA World Motor Sport Council can put it into the 2010 regulations , but this is likely to be a formality with teams already having voted in favour of the changes .
Although yet another change to the regulations is not ideal for F1 , especially after such fanfare in December at the first amendment , Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner is adamant that the sport should always be ready to put its hands up if it thinks things are wrong .
He also believed a greater points gap between first and second would provide greater motivation for drivers to fight harder for the win .
" I think you should never be afraid of change so long as it is a change for the better , " he told AUTOSPORT ahead of the SWG meeting .
" And I think that what the points are trying to be designed to do are first of all - to generate a pecking order perhaps lower down in the top ten - so that with the points going down to 10th place there is reward for a top ten finish .
" But I think also one of the factors that Bernie is keen to look at is perhaps having a heavier weight between first , second and third , so there is more emphasis that rather than drivers cruising and collecting points , that they have to go for it .
" It is not because drivers do n't want to take the risk , but if the points difference between a win and second is two points it is not the end of the world , whereas if it is a significant number then it adds motivation for the drivers to push each other very hard . "
AUTOSPORT understands that the SWG also discussed the idea of awarding points for pole position or fastest lap , but neither of these concepts were agreed .
The SWG also talked at length about the possibility of introducing a rule that would force drivers to make two mandatory pit stops during a race , but this was not approved either .
F1 drivers will therefore only need to make a single pit-stop in 2010 so as to ensure that they run on both types of tyres made available .
Antarctica is warming , but not melting anything like as much as expected .
In fact , during the continent ’s summer this time last year , there was less melting than at any time in the 30 years that we have had reliable satellite measurements of the region .
The apparent contradiction is explained by the seasonal pattern of warming , say two glaciologists writing in Eos , the weekly newspaper of the American Geophysical Union .
The continent ’s winters and springs have warmed most , but it is still too cold in these seasons for anything to melt .
Melting in Antarctica happens almost entirely in the summers , which have warmed very little , say Andrew Monaghan of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado , and Marco Tedesco of the City College of New York .
John King of the British Antarctic Survey , based in Cambridge , warned against misinterpreting the lack of summer warming .
“ Climate change denialists will use this work as evidence that Antarctica is not warming , despite the authors saying their works show no such thing , ” he said .
Summer meltdown
Every year is different , says Tedesco .
“ In 2005 , we had summer melting occurring inland as well as over the coastal ice shelves , and over areas up to 2500 metres above sea level . ”
And even during the exceptionally low melt of last summer , ice on the Antarctic peninsula , which stretches out towards South America , continued to melt .
The Wilkins ice shelf , which is attached to the peninsula , has been collapsing rapidly since February 2008 .

The continent ’s huge ice sheets contain enough frozen water to raise sea levels globally by around 60 metres .
Tedesco and Monaghan say the main factor in how much they warm each summer is the strength of the winds that circle the continent .
Circumpolar winds act as a barrier to warm air .
They have become stronger over the past four decades , effectively sealing off most of the continent each summer from the effects of global warming .
The circumpolar winds appear to have strengthened because the ozone layer in the stratosphere has thinned .
This has made the lower stratosphere cooler and generated stronger winds beneath .
But Tedesco warns that as the ozone hole heals in the coming decades , the winds will weaken , the continent will become much warmer in summer – and melting will increase .
Savage Love Assholes and Gasholes
Set me straight .
I married my wife several months ago after dating three years .
Things are generally excellent , except for one problem :
When my wife gets drunk , she gets crazy flirtatious .
She 'll dance close to people , touch them , hold hands .
A couple of times , I thought it went too far and I told her so .
She claims it is just harmless and she would never let anything happen .
Well , as it turns out , something did happen .
After getting kissed on the cheek by a woman I think was a lesbian at a recent party , it came out during the subsequent argument that in year two of our relationship , she was high and dancing at a club with several gay men and she French - kissed one of the friends .
While she acknowledges that a line was crossed ( which is why she did n't tell me when it happened ) , she says it was just a very intense but regrettable " friendship moment " and nothing more .
She says this gay man is not bi .
I 'm grappling with three issues : ( 1 ) Did she cheat ?
Although we 've never talked about the rules concerning kissing gay friends , we both know she crossed a line ( there was tongue ) .
( 2 ) How much did she betray me by not telling me until after we were married ?
( 3 ) Am I being a selfish prude by caring about either her aggressive flirting or this kiss ?
She is very contrite and swears she will calm down the flirtation .
Should I forgive her and move on ?
Or should I run the hell away before it 's too late ?
Seriously Troubled Here
1. No .
2 . Your wife 's failure to disclose a single drugged - up , blissed - out , pre-exchange - of - vows kiss shared with a gay dude on a dance floor — even with tongue — does not constitute a " betrayal . "
It constitutes an omission .
3 . Yes , STH , you are being a selfish prude , and yes , you should forgive her .
The aggressive flirting could be a problem — if your wife is flirting at all aggressively .
I 'm wary of accepting your characterization of her behavior at face value , STH , as your overreaction to the kiss leads me to believe that you might not be rational about your wife 's behavior generally .
Where you see getting too near , dancing too close , and being too friendly , a slightly less paranoid / controlling spouse might see innocent flirtatiousness .
But if she agrees that her flirting is indeed a problem — if for no other reason than it bothers her husband — and she 's willing to tamp it down for your sake , you should " forgive her and move on , " by which I mean " YOU SHOULD CEASE BEING SUCH A FUCKING ASSHOLE about ( 1 ) the kiss and ( 2 ) the flirting and ( 3 ) the fucking kiss already . "
That said , STH , I would n't want to be married to a man who claimed to love me but could n't forgive me for something so trifling as a meaningless kiss .
So I 'm not sure I 'm doing your wife any favors by talking you off the ledge .
Honestly , STH , someone who is hesitant to forgive is hardly husband material .
A successful marriage is basically an endless cycle of wrongs committed , apologies offered , and forgiveness granted , STH , all leavened by the occasional orgasm .
If you 're having such a hard time forgiving her for this piddling " betrayal , " STH , you 're not cut out for marriage and your wife may want to run away before it 's too late .
My husband and I have a " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy when we 're apart .
A few months ago , I hooked up with a guy on a business trip who said he and his wife have the same arrangement .
He was lying .
His wife found out and started harassing me on Facebook .
I truly feel horrible .
How can I know if someone is really in an open relationship when they say they are ?
I am so done .
Fucking Asshole Idiot Losers
The only way to verify that someone is in an open relationship is to speak to that person 's partner — and as that would constitute " telling , " FAIL , it would be a violation of a " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
But even a couple with a " please ask , do tell " policy probably has a rule against 2:00 a.m. calls from drunken hotel - bar pickups .
So you 'll have to trust your gut , FAIL , which failed you here .
Just remember this on your next business trip :
The further a married person is from home and the drunker that married person is , the likelier it is that that married person is lying to you .
I 'm a 17 - year - old gay male .
I 'm into farts .
I attend a high school where there are very few out gay guys , so I 'm looking forward to meeting new people in college .
The thing is , it was hard enough accepting that I 'm gay and harder still to accept that I have a fart fetish .
Do I now have to accept that I will never be able to go through the cycle of human sexual bonding in a normal way , since you suggest that fetishists like me should stick to sex workers and online hookups with fellow fetishists ?
I do n't mean to be combative .
I 'm just wondering what lies in store for me and whether there 's any hope .
I 'm not a sick bastard in any way but this , and it would be devastating for me to hear that I should skip dating altogether and head to the chat rooms .
I would be really grateful if you could offer me some candid — but sensitive — insight on this .
Help Out Pubescent Eproctophiliac
Here 's what lies in store for you , HOPE :
You 're going to meet guys online who share your fetish .
There are n't tons of you out there , I 'm sorry - ish to say , so that means the odds are slim that you 'll meet a fellow eproctophiliac living on your campus .
And if you do find someone online who lives on campus who shares your kink , the odds that you 'll be both physically and romantically attracted to him — the odds that he 'll be boyfriend material — are slimmer still .
But rest assured : People meet online every day — straight people , queer people , vanillas , kinksters — and fall in love .
So if you do find someone online who shares your kink and whom you click with , HOPE , do n't make the mistake of ruling him out as a boyfriend just because you met him in a kinky chat room .
You were in that chat room and you 're boyfriend material , right ?
And if you meet a fellow fetishist whom you 're really into who lives on the other side of the country , well , that totally blows .
But the rarer a fetish , the greater the lengths a fetishist sometimes has to go to find a partner .
If you 're into him and he's into you and he 's boyfriend material , get your ass on an airplane and go see the boy .
( Take all the usual precautions — get his real name and real phone number , have your first meeting in a public place , make sure someone knows where you 're going , have someplace to stay , etc. )
You 'll also be able to meet guys the normal way , HOPE — in your classes , in bars , at parties , and via non -kink hookup websites popular with gay college boys .
You may wind up partnered with a guy who finds you so attractive that he 's willing to indulge you .
Or , like a lot of people with unique and / or challenging fetishes , you may wind up in a long - term relationship with a loving partner with whom you enjoy vanilla sex while indulging your fetish via online porn , chats , webcam sessions , and , yes , the odd session with an understanding sex worker whom you treat with respect and overtip .

CITE SOLEIL , Haiti ( Reuters ) - Heavily armed gang members who once ran Haiti ’s largest slum like warlords have returned with a vengeance since Tuesday ’s earthquake damaged the National Penitentiary allowing 3,000 inmates to break out .

The pacification of Cite Soleil had been one of President Rene Prevail ’s few undisputed achievements since taking office in 2006 , until the quake devastated Port - au - Prince .
“ It ’s only natural that they would come back here .
This has always been their stronghold , ” said a Haitian police officer in the teeming warren of shacks , alleys and open sewers that is home to more than 300,000 people .
He and other policemen , who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the volatile situation in Cite Soleil , said notorious armed gangs had been making their presence felt here since the quake .
If large - scale violence erupts here amid the chaos and looting that has grown by the hour in Port - au - Prince since the temblor , it could pose a major challenge to efforts to reestablish law and order throughout the Haitian capital .
Cite Sole ’s gang leaders are larger - than - life criminals .
The stuff of urban legend and popular Haitian rap songs , they are now seen as a breed apart from other Haitians in that they alone benefited from the Tuesday ’s disaster .
Mounted on motorcycles , and brandishing assault rifles and guns thought to have been stripped from prison guards during the quake , the gang members include one stone - cold killer known only by the street name “ Blade . ”
Word on the street is that they swept down on the rubble of Haiti ’s collapsed Justice Ministry on Saturday morning and set it ablaze to destroy any records of their incarceration or criminal history .
When Reuters reporters clambered through broken bars to tour the cavernous National Penitentiary on Friday , there were few if any remaining records of inmates housed there .
Many may have been burned in a small and windowless cell .
It was still brick - oven hot days after the temblor .
ROBBING AND SHOOTING
Whatever actually happened inside the prison , it did not appear to have been seriously damaged by the quake .
There were no bodies inside and the only sign of life came from two lame dogs holed up in a cell packed with old mattresses .
Of the 3,000 inmates who escaped on Tuesday , overpowering an unknown number of guards , many were violent criminals with past links to Cite Soleil , a seaside slum that has long been a potent social symbol of the poorest country in the Americas .
“ They got out of prison and now they ’re going around trying to rob people , ” said Cite Soleil resident Elgin St. Louis , 34 .
“ Last night they spent the whole night shooting , ” she added .
“ We dread their return , ” said another resident , a younger man who gave his name as Forrestal Champlain .
“ They ’re armed , they have no morals and they could do anything . ”
Despite such vocal opposition to the gangs , resentment against the government still runs high in Cite Soleil , which was a bastion of support for former president Jean - Bertrand Aristide , a populist champion of the poor .
The mostly cinder - block homes are still pockmarked from pitched battles between gangs and U.N. peacekeepers , who have been in Haiti since June 2004 and were used by Preval to establish control over Cite Soleil after he took office .
But as one resident put it on Saturday : “ Preval ’s not in charge here .
No one ’s in charge except the ( gang ) bosses . ”
Haiti’s National Police Chief Mario Andresol had a different opinion , even as he acknowledged the escaped gang members posed a serious security risk .
“ My message to all those armed bandits that are trying to take advantage of this situation is that we will arrest them just as we did in the past , ” Andresol told Reuters .
“ We are in the process of taking appropriate measures to hunt down these criminals , ” he said .
