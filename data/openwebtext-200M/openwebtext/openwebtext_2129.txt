The FDA has announced an immediate change to the labeling of drugs in a family that includes popular impotence drugs , warning that they may lead to sudden , severe and potentially permanent hearing loss .
The erectile dysfunction drugs in the phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE5 ) class include Pfizer 's Viagra , Eli Lilly 's Cialis and GlaxoSmithKline 's Levitra .
Also receiving a label change will be blood pressure drug Revatio .
The FDA reviewed side effect reports on the drugs after a case study was published in thein 2007 , reporting that a 44 - year - old man had suffered sudden hearing loss after only 15 days on Viagra .
Upon review , the FDA uncovered 29 post - approval reports of patients undergoing sudden hearing loss from PDE5 drugs .
In two - thirds of cases , the hearing loss appeared to be permanent .
Hearing loss was sometimes , but not always , accompanied by dizziness or ringing in the ears .
The majority of cases involved only one ear .
" Because some level of hearing loss is usually associated with the aging process , patients on these drugs may not think to talk to their doctor about it , " said Janet Woodcock , the FDA 's chief medical officer .
The FDA advises all patients on PDE5 erectile dysfunction drugs to stop taking the medication immediately upon the first sign of sudden hearing loss , and to seek immediate medical care .
" Because Revatio is used to treat a potentially life - threatening condition , the FDA does not recommend [ that ] patients abruptly stop taking this medication , " the agency said .
Such patients " should consult their physician if they experience sudden problems with their hearing .
"
" The fact that the FDA is just now finding out about the risk of sudden hearing loss from impotence drugs demonstrates the failure of its drug approval process to identify serious health risks before drugs are approved , " said consumer health advocate Mike Adams .
" The truth is that most newly - approved prescription drugs are unleashed upon the population as large - scale experiments , and neither the drug 's manufacturer nor the FDA really has any idea of the true dangers of the drug . "
EA : Take - Two deal now " 50/50 at best "
An EA VP says that Take - Two is not a strategic priority , claiming that the publisher is not desperate

With the latest deadline on its USD 2 billion bid due to expire on May 16 , Electronic Arts has piled more pressure on acquisition target Take - Two - with VP of corporate communications Jeff Brown issuing the stark warning : " We 're not desperate and there 's a clock ticking . "
Speaking exclusively to GamesIndustry.biz at EA 's Vancouver headquarters , Brown hit back at Take - Two chairman Strauss Zelnick 's claim that the massive success of Grand Theft Auto IV vindicates the publisher 's decision to put off consideration of the deal in expectation of a higher bid .
" It 's always been mystifying as to why they thought it was important to wait , " Brown said .
" Everybody knew [ GTA IV ] was going to be fantastic ; everybody knew it was going to sell like crazy .
So to suggest anyone was surprised by the success of the game , commercial or critical , is nonsense . "
Since the initial approach was made on February 24 , EA management has been aggressive in its pursuit of Take - Two but has refused to increase the size of its original bid .
Brown rubbished suggestions that EA was undervaluing its target , whose GTA IV title has smashed sales records around the world , insisting : " The longer it takes to do [ the deal ] , the less valuable it is to EA . "
" EA 's not desperate , " he explained .
" Part of our model for making this thing work at USD 2 billion is the assumption that if we can get this done in time to publish their games going into the Christmas holiday in '08 - because EA has an unchallenged publishing capability around the world - we could without question sell more units of those games than they could if they were on their own .
" The passage of time serves to weaken the value and the certainty of this deal . "
Pressed on whether he still expected the acquisition to go through , Brown stated : " I think at best it 's a 50/50 proposition . "
However , he dismissed comparisons that have been drawn with Microsoft 's aborted pursuit of Yahoo ! , arguing : " The big difference here was that a good search engine is a strategic priority for Microsoft .
Take - Two is just not a strategic priority for EA . "
" EA is now developing more games , more brand new IP than ever before in its 25 year history .
We 've got a three - year plan with explosive growth all the way to our fiscal 2011 .
" We think [ Take Two 's studios are ] really great teams , that they 're creative people , and we would very much like to give them a home and access to our publishing capability , but we just do n't need it . "

Despite objections from consumer advocates , in the last two weeks California judge Jed Clampbet has sent 142 delinquent homeowners to state prison for up to three years each , for failing to honor their home mortgage obligations .
Most of the former homeowners were shocked to find they could be suddenly locked up for employing the common “ walkaway ” strategy , where homedebtors whose no -money - down adjustable - rate teaser mortgages are about to reset to full actual interest rates simply stop making payments but continue living in their homes rent - free for up to eight months before being evicted , then try to skip town leaving the bank holding the bag .
Under the anti-fraud provisions of the 1969 California Real Estate Loan Statute , section 7 , chapter 13 , such behavior is indeed criminal and can be prosecuted .
Until recently the law had not been actively enforced , but due to the tidal wave of foreclosures the district attorney is now cracking down hard on mortgage scofflaws .
Banks generally applaud the stepped - up enforcement .
“ These folks thought they could just scam the system and get away with it , ” admonished mortgage industry spokesman Snidely Wachovia .
“ Now they ’re finally getting what they deserve . ”
Consumer rights groups are organizing protests across the state , trying to stop or at least slow down the impending prosecution of an estimated 20,000 additional delinquent homeowners .
“ These people are completely unaware of what is about to happen to them , ” claimed Shirley Yewghest of the California Delinquent Homeowners Protection Association .
“ Yes , they did receive foreclosure warning letters in the mail , but very few actually read the fine print .
They hear people telling stories of walking away without getting caught , and they think they can get away with it too .
By the time they realize that they are in fact criminals , it ’s too late , and they find themselves behind bars . ”
All the news is not negative , however .
Apparently spring is in the air in the California state prison system , bringing along with it dozens of whirlwind romances between newly - jailed former homeowners and long - time inmates .
And thanks to the new ruling legalizing same - sex marriages in California , wedding bells have been ringing non-stop .
Lifetime inmate Bubba “ Whoppa ” Johnson found new love with Cornwell Sooie , a San Diego real estate investor caught up in the recent sting operation targeting delinquent homeowners .
Back in 2006 Mr. Sooie was sitting atop a mini real estate empire worth nearly $ 8 million on paper .
When the housing bubble collapsed , he lost it all .
Those fast - paced days of real estate deal - making are butt a distant memory now , as Mr. Sooie settles in to his new married life in prison .
While nuptial bliss is no substitute for the thrill of easy real - estate riches , at least it will keep him busy for the next three years .

Here 's the perfect Mother 's Day gift for your favorite surgically - enhanced breeder : My Beautiful Mommy , a picture book explaining plastic surgery to the under - 8 set .
Mommy is by Dr. Michael Salzhauer , a Florida plastic surgeon who tells Newsweek he was inspired to write the book when he saw parents coming into his office with their kids , who would become confused and upset when they saw their mothers in bandages .
" Parents generally tend to go into this denial thing .
They just try to ignore the kids ' questions completely ... With the tummy tucks , [ the mothers ] can't lift anything .
They 're in bed .
The kids have questions . "
The hero of the book is named " Dr. Michael " and he looks like the dad in the Incredibles , all solid muscle and square jaw .
Advertisement
My Beautiful Mommy tells the story of a little girl whose mother gets a tummy tuck and breast implants ( did you guys know that this combo is referred to as a " mommy makeover " ? ) along with a nose job for good measure .
Before the woman goes into surgery , she explains to her daughter , " You see , as I got older , my body stretched and I could n't fit into my clothes anymore .
Dr. Michael is going to help fix that and make me feel better . "
It 's unclear why the mother also chooses rhinoplasty , but she does tell her daughter that the nose will appear " different , my dear — prettier ! "
( Because that 's an excellent message to send to your daughter : is n't she going to think that her nose is inadequate , too ? )
Newsweek quotes one mother , Gabriela Acosta , who got a tummy tuck .
She read the book to her son , Junior , and at a party shortly after Acosta 's recovery , Junior went around asking people , " Did you see her new belly button ?
It 's so pretty ! "
The article gives stats about plastic surgery , including the fact that , last year , 348,000 women had boob jobs and 148,000 had tummy tucks , but what I 'm wondering is who are these people ?
Advertisement
There are so many articles about plastic surgery — women dying from Botox , women getting boob jobs for their weddings — but I barely know anyone who 's had surgery at all .
Sure , a smattering of post - grad nose jobs have occurred , but it does n't seem to be this all - out country - wide body reconstruction / self - loathing that the sheer amount of press makes it seem like .
Is it because celebrities get so much surgery that it makes it seem like the norm ?
Or do I live in a fantasy land where women spend their money on new books , not new breasts ?
16 people died from having botulism injected into their faces ?
You do n't say !

Texas professors give to Democrats over GOP 3 - to - 1 Texas professors donate more to Dems than to GOP
Clinton leads pack in campaign dollars , a study by the Chronicle finds
WASHINGTON — Texas university professors overwhelmingly favor Democratic candidates in their campaign contributions , a Houston Chronicle study of Federal Election Commission records has found .
Faculty members have contributed $ 406,384 to Democratic candidates or committees in the 2008 campaign season — 71 percent of their political donations .
Republicans have received $ 135,216 , or 24 percent , of donations through the end of March .
University personnel gave $ 27,915 to nonpartisan political action committees or third party candidates .
The professors ' top pick was Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton .
She received $ 129,721 in contributions , ahead of fellow Democrat Barack Obama with $ 104,911 .
Republican nominee - presumptive John McCain lagged far behind , in third place with $ 25,130 in college contributions .
The professors favored Democratic organizations , such as the Democratic National Committee , over Republican groups by more than a 3 - to - 1 margin .
University of Texas faculty sent the most money to candidates and political committees .
UT personnel donated $ 227,645 — 74 percent to Democrats , 19 percent to Republicans and 7 percent to nonpartisan causes .
Every one of the 10 most politically active colleges leans Democratic , even traditionally conservative campuses such as Texas A&M University .
The most heavily Democratic schools were Houston 's Rice University and Fort Worth 's Texas Christian University .
Ninety - seven percent of the professors ' contributions at both schools went to the Democrats .
The most Republican - leaning schools in the top 10 were Southern Methodist University ( 40 percent ) and the University of North Texas ( 39 percent ) .
SMU will host the George W. Bush Presidential Library .
And North Texas was the longtime employer of conservative economics professor and former House Majority Leader Dick Armey .
Among other Houston schools , donations at the University of Houston were 81 percent Democratic .
Two Houston schools gave a majority of campaign dollars to Republicans — Texas Southern and South Texas College of Law — but in each case it was because of the donations of a single professor that were larger than the total given by other faculty members .
The university donors include some prominent Lone Star academics , including University of Texas marketing professor William H. Cunningham , a former UT president who gave to Clinton ; UT law professor Lino Graglia , who favors McCain ; and Texas A&M neuroscience professor William R. Klemm , who donated to Republican Mitt Romney .
But most of the college donors are little known beyond their campuses .
Reaction varies
Conservative activists said the Chronicle 's findings only reinforced their views that college campuses are out of touch with mainstream values .
" These people are as far away from middle America and its values as Amarillo is from Islamabad , " said conservative strategist Keith Appell .
" In many cases , today 's professors were yesteryear 's anti-American protesters — some of them violent , as in the case of Senator Obama 's association with ( former Weather Underground bomber ) Bill Ayers , who is a college professor in Illinois . "
But professors contacted by the Chronicle said they are doing nothing more than exercising their right to free speech , whether they support Democrats or Republicans .
" You 've got to put your money where your conviction is , now and then , " said Harry L. Reed , a professor at South Texas College of Law , who gave $ 680 to McCain and $ 550 to the Republican National Committee .
Since 1990 , education interests , mostly college professors , have donated $ 133.7 million to federal candidates and committees , according to statistics compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
Democrats have received 70 percent of those contributions .
Shift to Democrats
Professors have become even bigger givers — and bigger supporters of the Democratic Party — since George W. Bush became president .
In the 2008 campaign cycle , Democrats have received 75 percent of donations by educators nationwide .
Educators point out that their political involvement is a personal matter and should not reflect on their universities .
Louise Fincher , associate department chair for kinesiology at the University of Texas at Arlington , stressed that her $ 200 contribution to the National Athletic Trainers ' Association Political Action Committee is given " as an individual , not in my role as a university professor . "
But many professors are quick to admit that their profession leans to the left politically .
" Like most law professors , I call myself a Yellow Dog Democrat , " said Mark Gergen of the University of Texas at Austin .
" I think I voted for two Republicans in my life , and that 's talking about every possible ( office ) . "
This year , Gergen is backing Obama , whom he calls " that rare combination of someone who is very smart and has extraordinary character . "
Jorge Ramirez , a Texas Tech University law professor , served on the Harvard Law Review with Obama and has donated to him this year .
" When he announced for president , I just thought , ' Here is an individual who is cut from a different mold , ' " said Ramirez , who served as executive director of the Texas Democratic Party from 1996 to 1998 .
Ramirez said he was " a big supporter " of Bill Clinton and " I like Hillary a lot . "
But his personal relationship with Obama , " as well as the vision he is presenting , made me want to support him more . "

Costa Rica is a country rich with renewable energy .
In fact , it gets about 99 % of all its electrical energy from clean sources , and it ’s aiming to be the first country to become carbon neutral ( more about that below ) .
Some of Costa Rica ’s energy sources include geothermal energy , the burning of sugarcane waste and other biomass , solar and wind energy .
However , the largest source of energy is hydroelectricity — its hydroelectric dams provide more than 82 % of the country ’s electricity .
But the electric needs of Costa Rica are increasing , and the government now wants to build new dams that would displace indigenous villages and flood valuable habitats .
Local environmental groups are opposing the construction of new hydroelectric dams .
Also , Costa Rica ’s efforts to minimize its own contributions to global warming have made it especially vulnerable to climate changes caused by other countries .
The reason is rain .
Even a tiny shift in rainfall patterns could leave the country without enough water to meet its growing demand for electricity .
And scientists say climate change is likely to have a significant effect on rainfall .
But Costa Rica is working to become the world ’s first carbon - neutral country ( other countries vying to be first are Monaco , Norway , New Zealand and Iceland ) .
Costa Rica wants to become carbon neutral in time to celebrate 200 years of independence in 2021 , says environment and energy minister Roberto Dobles .
Wind power might come to forefront in Costa Rica — a large wind farm with 22 turbines has been working in Tilarán , Guanacaste since 2002 and more are scheduled to be installed in the mountains of Escazú and Santa Ana .
A new geothermal plant , using naturally - existing superheated water to power steam turbines , is also scheduled to be producing electricity in 2010 near Rincón de la Vieja Volcano , in the province of Guanacaste .

CPS takes children from polygamists '
Texas compound
AUSTIN — Nearly 50 children were removed from a polygamist sect 's compound in West Texas after a teenage girl reported being raped at the remote ranch , state officials said today .
Eighteen were officially removed by court order because they either had been abused or neglected or were at risk , child protective officials said .
CPS spokesman Darrell Azar said about 30 other children and youths were placed in a bus and taken from the compound founded by Warren Jeffs , who was convicted last year in Utah of being an accomplice to the rape of a 14 - year - old girl .
" The actions we 've taken today have nothing to do with religion or lifestyle , " said Azar .
" The pure interest is in protecting children from abuse and neglect .
That 's what we have done . "
The 18 who were removed by court order were transported about 45 miles to San Angelo .
CPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins said the agency was trying to place them in foster homes or other temporary settings .
" We 're obviously trying to take care of them and assess their needs and trying to find placements for them , " said Crimmins .
Officials also were executing arrest and search warrants at the Yearn for Zion Ranch but no arrests had been made by late this afternoon .
Gov. Rick Perry 's spokesman Robert Black said the governor 's office was informed by CPS Tuesday that there would be a raid at the compound by the end of the week .
" There was reason to believe a girl had called in and said she was being raped , " Black said .
" There also was reason to believe they were heavily armed out there . "
Department of Public Safety officers and social workers first went to the secretive group 's home Thursday .
They spent the night and this morning checking on the children 's welfare and questioning people living in the compound .
Members of the sect were " very cooperative , " said Tom Vinger , a DPS spokesman .
Officials would not say how many arrest warrants there are or what the possible charges are against those named .
Members of the polygamist sect from Utah known as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints arrived in Texas in late 2003 .
They purchased land four miles outside of Eldorado , a town of 2,000 located about 45 miles south of San Angelo , and built a large temple and dormitory .
Randy Mankin , owner of the local newspaper , the Eldorado Success , said law enforcement has blocked roads leading to the compound .
Jeffs ' conviction appeared to have little impact on the sect , which continues to add buildings , Mankin said .
" It has not stopped one bit .
In fact , it 's accelerated , " said Mankin .
" In four years they 've built another town outside my town . "
A few men from the sect show up in Eldorado to shop , but women and children are rarely seen , Mankin said .
Jeffs was convicted last September in Utah of being an accomplice to the rape of a 14 - year - old girl who testified she was forced to wed her cousin .
He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of five years to life .
Jeffs is in the Mohave County Jail in Kingman , Ariz. , awaiting trial on charges of sexual conduct with a minor , incest and conspiracy to commit sexual conduct with a minor

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States tortures prisoners in violation of international law , former President Carter said Wednesday .
Former President Carter says the U.S. " has abandoned the basic principle of human rights . "
" I do n't think it .
I know it , " Carter told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer .
" Our country for the first time in my life time has abandoned the basic principle of human rights , " Carter said .
" We 've said that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to those people in Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo , and we 've said we can torture prisoners and deprive them of an accusation of a crime to which they are accused . "
Carter also said President Bush creates his own definition of human rights .
Carter 's comments come on the heels of an October 4 article in The New York Times disclosing the existence of secret Justice Department memorandums supporting the use of " harsh interrogation techniques . "
These include " head - slapping , simulated drowning and frigid temperatures , " according to the Times .
The White House last week confirmed the existence of the documents but would not make them public .
Responding to the newspaper report Friday , Bush defended the techniques used , saying , " This government does not torture people . "
Asked about Bush 's comments , Carter said , " That 's not an accurate statement if you use the international norms of torture as has always been honored -- certainly in the last 60 years since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was promulgated .
" But you can make your own definition of human rights and say we do n't violate them , and you can make your own definition of torture and say we do n't violate them . "
Watch Blitzer 's interview with the former president »
After reading a transcript of Carter 's remarks , a senior White House official said , " Our position is clear .
We do n't torture . "
The official said , " It 's just sad to hear a former president speak like that . "
Carter also criticized some of the 2008 Republican presidential candidates , calling former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani " foolish " for his contention the United States should be open to use force on Iran .
" I hope that he does n't become president and try to impose his conviction that we need to go to war with Iran , " Carter said .
The Giuliani campaign declined to comment on Carter 's criticism .
The former president did n't spare the rest of the GOP field either .
" They all seem to be outdoing each other in who wants to go to war first with Iran , who wants to keep Guantanamo open longer and expand its capacity -- things of that kind , " Carter said .
" They 're competing with each other to appeal to the ultra - right - wing , war - mongering element in our country , which I think is the minority of our total population . "
Carter declined to say which Republican candidate he feared the most .
" If I condemn one of them , it might escalate him to the top position in the Republican ranks , " he said .
Democratic Sens. Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois also drew Carter 's criticism for refusing recently to pledge to withdraw all troops from Iraq by the end of their first terms if they win the presidency in 2008 .
" I disagree with their basic premise that we 'll still be there ; I think the American people want out , " Carter said .
" If there is an unforeseen development where Iraqi people request American presence over a period of time I think that would possibly be acceptable , but that 's not my personal preference . "

I guess I could make my friend Denny the journalist happy and begin this way – with a lede :
Neil Aspinall , friend of Paul , then George , then John , then Ringo , then The Beatles ’ road manager and personal assistant , then chief executive for Apple Corps for more than 4 decades has died .
He was 66 .
But since I ’m a storyteller , let me begin somewhere else :
My first encounter with George was behind the schoolâ€™s air - raid shelters .
This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out - of - breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine .
It was one of the first cigarettes either of us had smoked .
We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully .
After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together ( Aspinall , McCartney and Harrison ) .
By the time we were ready to take the GCE exams weâ€™d added John Lennon to our ‘ Mad Lad ’ gang .
He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime ….
– Neil Aspinall in The Beatles ’ Anthology DVD
I ’ve long held a hypothesis that my musician and music writer friends argue with me about from time to time .
I believe that the best bands form from childhood or school friends who discover in each other a deep love and understanding of music and who somehow galvanize around that love .
That ’s certainly true about The Beatles – and Steely Dan – and U2 – and Nirvana .
You are brothers in music .
This gives you some sort of synergistic power that you might never have had …and sometimes , as in the above cited cases , it makes you rich and famous … .
( Neil Aspinall , Mal Evans )
There ’s a corollary to my hypothesis .
In the old days , when you formed a band , you had your brothers in music who were your fellow musicians , but you also had your friends outside the band .
If or when the band got more serious , those in the latter group either became friends with your band mates and then took on roles as the band needed them to ( roles ranging from roadie to business manager to understudy ) or gradually drifted out of your orbit .
The relationships you had with these friends who followed you into the music were trust relationships based on loyalty and friendship built from childhood and only strengthened by what you and they did together .
These were the guys who helped you carry your equipment – the guys who traveled and ate and drank with you .
You loved the music – and they loved you and you loved them – because you made the music and they helped you to make it .
And if you were smart and / or lucky , you remembered to tell them .
That ’s a far cry from most of the relationships musicians have with record company executives , booking agents , and other figures in the “ music business ” as lovingly described by Hunter Thompson :
The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench , a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free , and good men die like dogs .
There ’s also a negative side .
Only yesterday Paul McCartney was at Aspinall ’s bedside .
Trust me when I say that most musicians think about their business managers ’ health rather differently than Paul ’s demonstration of care suggests ….
Neil Aspinall worked with his fellow “ mad lads ” who became music legends as only their friend could do .
That ’s why Paul and Ringo grieve today .
So maybe Denny will allow me to revise my lede to reflect what musicians everywhere would want written about their own “ Neils ” :
Neil Aspinall , friend of Paul , George , John , and Ringo for more than 4 decades , has died .
He was 66 .

Is airframe production the mark of a successful country ?
The US has Boeing , Europe has Airbus , Canada has Bombardier , Brazil has Embraer .
Even China ’s trying to get in on the business with the China Comercial Aircraft Company , even though that ’s going to take a couple ten years to get rolling .
Russia ’s flagship producer , Tupolev , not unlike their progress as a democratic nation , has been pretty lethargic .
Much of their production has been in the commercial sector while very few new aircraft designs have surfaced .
Under a new commercial wing of The United Aircraft Building Corporation ( UABC ) , however , things are starting to turn around .
UABC , Russia ’s new manufacturing congolmerate ( which will soon run Tupolev as well ) is now employing Sukhoi Corporation to start production of a new series of medium range jets .
The first , dubbed the Sukhoi Superjet 100’s , are already well underway .
First test flights were just complete this week and the company has an aggressive production schedule that includes initial deliveries later this year .
Their plan is to directly compete with medium range aircraft — those like Bombardier ’s CRJ ’s or Embraer ’s E - Jets — but mostly in the Russian market .
Reducing dependence on foreign airframe manufacturers ( not unlike China ’s plans ) , will therefore make their economy stronger .
Do n’t expect to be flying on any Superjets in the near future though .
Most of the initial orders have gone to Russian carriers and even then it ’s going to be a few years until all of those orders are fulfilled .
Until that point , I ’m still happy flying on Tupolev 154 .

The Democratic contest has been a 50 - 50 proposition for months now–more precisely , a 51 - 49 percent endeavor or maybe a 52 - 48 - percent face - off in Barack Obama ’s favor , according to the pledged delegate count and the popular vote .
Hillary Clinton ’s 9 - point win in the Keystone State ( which apparently did not net her a significant pickup in pledged delegates ) does not change this .
In fact , her Pennsylvania triumph does not change the fundamentals of the race .
Obama is still on track to end the primaries with a slight edge in pledged delegates .
And Clinton is still in the race , clinging tightly to her candidacy and reiterating rationales to stay in the hunt : I have more experience ; I ’m better prepared to be commander - in - chief ; I ’ve withstood the worst of the GOP attack machine ; I ’ve won the big states .
Bottom line :
It ’s not over , and the contest is not likely to end anytime soon .
At HRC HQ in Philadelphia on Tuesday night , Terry McAuliffe , Clinton ’s campaign manager , ebulliently declared , “ She is taking this all the way to Denver . ”
But many Democratic superdelegates and insiders are hardly enthusiastic about a bitterly fought campaign that trudges through the next nine primaries ( which conclude in early June ) and then continues , as a media - driven contest of Democrat - on - Democrat sniping , for three months until the convention in Denver at the end of August .
The question is , will these Democrats be able to do anything about it ?
If Clinton is committed to going the distance , she can not be stopped .
No one – not even those mighty superdelegates–can literally force her out .
She cannot win the final primaries by margins large enough to erase Obama ’s lead in voter - determined delegates .
Everyone knows that .
But she can keep on challenging Obama , doing well enough–winning some contests or placing a strong second–to justify , at least to herself and her supporters , her continued presence in the race .
During that time , she can hope something happens that does alter the landscape ( look , evidence that Obama is indeed a secret Muslim ! ) , and she can also lay the groundwork for a post - primaries effort to persuade superdelegates to overturn Obama ’s narrow victory among pledged delegates .
Yet that project can only succeed with successful assaults on Obama .
Her path to the nomination depends on one fuel : fierce attacks .
She can win the nomination only by tearing down Obama after the voting is done and by threatening party unity .
Clinton is obviously fine with that –at this stage .
But how far is she willing to go ?
Her shots at Obama may have helped her win in Pennsylvania .
But they were not cost - free .
According to the exit polls , 42 percent of the Pennsylvania Democratic voters consider Clinton untrustworthy .
( Thirty percent said the same about Obama . )
Sixty - seven percent said they believed she had attacked Obama unfairly .
Only 49 percent said Obama had thrown low - blows .
And Clinton did not redefine her standing among Democrats .
Two - thirds of Pennsylvania ’s Democratic voters said Clinton was “ in touch with people ” like them .
Yet two - thirds had the same assessment of Obama .
Despite all the fuss about Obama ’s “ bitter ” remark , Clinton had no edge in the candidate - of - the - people category .
And 51 percent of the voters said the candidate quality they consider most important was the ability to implement change .
Among these voters , Obama attracted 70 percent .
With her Pennsylvania win , Clinton can raise funds–her campaign claimed millions of dollars poured in on Tuesday night–and she can proceed to Indiana and North Carolina ( which hold primaries on May 6 ) , staying alive because she insists she is alive .
Remember the Monty Python “ dead parrot ” bit ?
As long as Clinton refuses to concede she cannot win , she remains a contender–or at least a force Obama and the Democratic Party must contend with .
After all , the party has no official coroner who can pronounce her gone .
And –no small matter –Democratic voters do keep turning out for her .
In her victory speech in Philadelphia , she depicted herself as a politician who fights damn hard on the campaign trail for you and who will fight damn hard in the White House for you .
Clearly , she was trying to turn what some superdelegates might perceive as an irritant or problem–her stubborn determination –into a reason why superdelegates ought to dump Obama for her .
During the Monica Lewinsky scandal–when many pundits and Clinton foes predicted Bill Clinton ’s demise –the Clintons learned a valuable lesson : sometimes you just have to put one foot in front of the other and keep moving ahead , paying no heed to those who say you have no choice but to quit .
They had their party –most of it–behind them during those days .
And now Hillary Clinton , with significant voter support , is plodding ahead , stuck with a strategy that at this point leaves her only the nuclear option of nullifying Obama ’s primary and caucus victories .
But , she can reason , if I am not dead , then I ’m still alive–and still have a chance .
Politically speaking , she is somewhere between dead and alive .
The undead ?
The next primaries may nudge her closer to one of those poles .
And , once again , they may not be decisive .
But as of now , amid the glow of her Pennsylvania victory , it ’s up to Hillary Clinton to decide at what point might rest the bitter end .

Floridiot # 4 ( we remember ) Liebermann is out stumping for water torture .
Ex-federal prosecutor Sen .
Whitehouse points out that is a crime :
A sheriff in a Texas county waterboarded prisoners in order to extract confessions .
Count one of the indictment asserted that the defendants conspired to -- and this is a quote from the Department 's own indictment – “ subject prisoners to a suffocating ‘ water torture ’ ordeal in order to coerce confessions .
This generally included the placement of a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of water in the towel until the prisoner began to move , jerk , or otherwise indicate he was suffocating and / or drowning . ”
The sheriff and his deputies were all convicted by a jury under count one .
It did n't end there .
The case then went up on appeal , and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered a decision .
I have in my hands United States of America v. Lee , 744 F.2d 1124 , decided in 1984 , in which they gave appellate review of these convictions .
Finally , at sentencing , U.S. District Judge James DeAnda 's comments , according to the article , were “ He told the former Sheriff that he had allowed law enforcement to fall into ‘ the hands of a bunch of thugs .
The operation down there would embarrass the dictator of a country . ’”
That is the opinion of a U.S. district court judge at a sentencing on waterboarding .
( Senator Whitehouse , emphasis added ) .
Yes , Keith is correct , the preznit blush is a lying , fascist , wannabe dictator .
Liebermann is a clone and saying this in the shadow of Rep.
Lantos 's death , who was in the holocaust NAZI camps , is a shame that will follow him into infamy .

Holy Sh**!
I thought Keith 's head was gonna explode .
And now I wonder how this is going to play out .
Because I know many of us use the word fascism to describe what is happening , but I 'm not sure how it is going to go down when Keith does it on MSNBC .
By the way , has Keith had anything about Sibel Edmunds ?
That is the safer way to expose " fascism . "
Just have the whistleblowers exposing it on your show .

The People United Will Never Be Defeated Common sense says there is no explanation other than election fraud for how GW was " elected . "
Think back to 2000 .
There were all those new voters .
There was already all that dirt on GW ripping off the Texas people when he owned the Rangers .
He was Mr. Death Penalty , even going so far as to make fun of Karla Tucker .
He was already an El Busto from Arbusto .
It was already apparent that he was a C- student .
I saw Olbermann last night .
The GOP is sticking to their script of the war on terror .
My humble prediction is the proverbial they want Hillary or McCain as President .
I realise Obama has flaws .
He leans a bit too right for myself .
But he definitely appears as the best choice at this point , imho .
So I could see McCain being elected through fraud .
The explanations will be the same .
That we are a bitterly divided country , that we are at war against terrorists , that exit polls do n't mean squat except for in the Ukraine , yadda , yadda , yadda .
If they can't pull off the McCain thing , then I think the next choice will be Hillary .
Maybe she is on the up and up , that myself and others are wrong about her .
If McCain becomes President , to me , that means that this country is completely rigged .
We nobodies are making a difference , however .
Just keep crossing those t's and dotting those I's , and no DailyCIAKos or Mike Rivero will be able to spin reality successfully .
Short term , people like Mr. BradBlog might seem to be obfuscated and whatnot , but long term this place is turning into a monumental exposure of the " free world " being bought and sold through election fraud .
Maybe BradBlog does n't like to come out and say there is all this election fraud going on .
But it is fairly obvious .
And all this documentation is making a profund difference .

Wow , I really thought we would never see the day when the " F " Word has been said out loud on the tv news .
Considering that this is the same cable network that fired Phil Donahue after he had the temerity to question the invasion of Iraq , the same network that reportedly required him to book two conservative guests for every liberal , it would seem that maybe MNSBC has grown up .
Maybe now the suits at MSNBC see that chasing the increasingly marginalized , decaying audience of Faux News and trying to emulate Faux 's blustering , fact - free programming is NOT the way to go --- and instead decided there was money to be made serving the huge audience out there looking for facts , truth , and blunt logic .

That is 100 % not in support of extending it while preznit blush lies that it was the democrats who endangered America .

Yep , we westerners tend to look to the old Germany for the prime example of propaganda .
A little history from an x-bushie might be instructive :
I remember that my first response to the reports of abuse and torture at Guantanamo Bay was to accuse the accusers of exaggeration or deliberate deception .
I did n’t believe America would ever do those things .
I ’d also supported George W Bush in 2000 , believed it necessary to give the president the benefit of the doubt in wartime , and knew Donald Rumsfeld as a friend .
It struck me as a no - brainer that this stuff was being invented by the far left or was part of Al - Qaeda propaganda .
After all , they train captives to lie about this stuff , do n’t they ?
Bottom line : I trusted the president in a time of war to obey the rule of law that we were and are defending .
And then I was forced to confront the evidence .
( Andrew Sullivan ) .
It is a travesty when the " free press " is forced to look at the evidence .
Pray tell , what are they looking at if not at evidence before they publish " news " ?
Anyway , he went on to say :
So is “ enhanced interrogation ” torture ?
One way to answer this question is to examine history .
The phrase has a lineage .
Verschärfte Verneh - mung , enhanced or intensified interrogation , was the exact term innovated by the Gestapo to describe what became known as the “ third degree ” .
It left no marks .
It included hypothermia , stress positions and long - time sleep deprivation .
( ibid . ) .
Eat your heart out NAZI 's , because from henceforth the preznit blush and his loyal bushies ( both of them ) will be the standard .

A Secret Cave Inside the Rock of Gibralter
Source : http://www.discovergibralter.com
Author : Not Listed
Further Information : EyeSpy Magazine Vol. 6 , # 47 , 2007 ( Current Issue ) http://www.eyespymag.com
Exciting new information has come to light regarding Gibraltar 's infamous “ Stay Behind Cave ” or Operation Tracer to give it its proper name .
This was one of the best kept secrets of WW2 .
In the event of Gibraltar being captured by German forces , six men would have been sealed into a secret chamber in which they would have been expected to survive and observe the activities of the Germans for a period of one year or more .
In 1997 “ Stay Behind Cave ” was discovered in Gibraltar but unfortunately no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission .
These individuals have remained as elusive as the chamber itself .
Thankfully this situation has now changed .
In November 2006 Jim Crone from discovergibraltar.com and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson MBE , senior tunnel guide with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , had the immense privilege of meeting possibly the only member of Operation Tracer still alive today .
Jim and Pete travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England .
Dr Cooper ( 92 years ) provided a fabulous opportunity to shed light on Tracer with his direct involvement in the mission as a Surgeon - Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve ( RNVR ) .
Despite fading memories , both Pete , Jim and others present at the meeting helped Dr Cooper recall stories about his colleagues , his training , and his feelings about such an incredible task .
His exceptional career in the RNVR was discussed including his voluntary service on board hospital ship SS Uganda during the Falklands War at the age of 67 .
Rumours about a secret chamber in Gibraltar have persisted since the war and many people devoted considerable amounts of their time to exploring Gibraltar 's existing tunnels , caves and sheer cliffs in the hope of finding it .
In 1997 the Gibraltar Caving Group discovered a sophisticated secret complex hidden close to Lord Airey 's Battery at the top of the southern end of the Rock .
The discovery happened when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel .
Further searching led them to carefully break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over fifty years .
The rooms were without doubt intended for use in Operation Tracer , and became affectionately known as " Stay Behind Cave " .
Dr Cooper 's description of the secret chamber that he was taken to in 1942 differs considerably to the layout of " Stay Behind Cave " .
This has fuelled existing rumours that a second secret chamber is yet to be discovered .
There is a sketch of such a chamber in our research files , it originated from an MI6 source .
Further information has come from a former GCHQ telegraphist which suggests that tandem Operation Tracer units operated during the Suez crisis , so this may also have been the case in Gibraltar .
Although it is very possible that Dr Coopers memory is playing tricks with him , it has nevertheless been prudent to conduct a series of searches of the Upper Rock during January 2007 .
A number of key areas have been identified within MOD property .
As yet nothing has been discovered .
When Dr Cooper was shown photographs and diagrams of the OP ( Observation Post ) found in 1997 , he felt very strongly that it was not what he experienced in 1942 .
Further questioning with the aid of aerial photographs and views of Gibraltar only reinforced his opinion that he was not involved with anything at the southern area of the Rock which is the location of the OP discovered in 1997 .
He also described his OP as having no stairways leading to the lookout holes .
His firm opinion , despite faded memories was of lookout holes being at opposite ends of the same room .
This is not the case with the 1997 discovery .
Discussions are currently taking place in the hope of bringing Dr Cooper to Gibraltar to reunite him with " Stay Behind " Cave or to possibly identify the whereabouts of a second secret chamber .
When Are Two Algorithms the Same ?
Andreas Blass , Nachum Dershowitz , Yuri Gurevich .
February 2008
People usually regard algorithms as more abstract than the programs that implement them .
The natural way to formalize this idea is that algorithms are equivalence classes of programs with respect to a suitable equivalence relation .
We argue that no such equivalence relation exists .
A bit more philosophical than usual , but the issue is quite relevant to discussions in the field .
It is possible to stipulate any equivalence relation that is considered useful ( e.g. , equivalence up to local transformations ) but the notion of a universally applicable relation is indeed problematic .
A spokeswoman for Money Management International says it seeks payments from lenders because government grants do not cover costs .
The group ’s counselors educate clients only about how loans work and do not recommend whether to proceed , she said , adding that the average time a counselor spends with a client is 58 minutes .
“ There is no quid pro quo relationship with lenders , ” a Money Management International spokeswoman , Catherine Williams , said in an e-mail message , adding that clients receive the same advice whether a lender pays for the session or not .
“ Funding is not tied to the outcome of any case . ”
Even when lenders do not pay for counseling , it can still prove unhelpful .
Ms. Baker ’s counseling session , which was provided by an agency that does not accept money from lenders , lasted only about a half hour , and she walked away from the conversation still confused , she said .
Then the saleswoman persuaded her to sign the loan forms .
After the reverse mortgage closed , Ms. Baker used the proceeds to pay off a $ 68,000 traditional mortgage on her home , and she put about $ 33,000 into various savings accounts .
The remaining $ 100,000 was used to purchase , at the saleswoman ’s urging , two deferred annuities  complex contracts that offer monthly income in exchange for a large lump - sum payment .
Those annuities prohibited Ms. Baker from gaining access to most of her funds for seven years unless she paid a stiff penalty .
Moreover , the annuities were likely to cost her money rather than pay her .
Annuities are so complex that it is impossible to forecast precisely how much Ms. Baker will receive from them .
However , based on recent payout data for similar products , she will probably earn about $ 520 a month from her annuities for the rest of her life .
Ms. Baker ’s mortgage debt is increasing by about $ 600 a month as the interest compounds on the money she used to purchase those annuities .

The cholesterol drug did absolutely everything it was supposed to do -- except for demonstrably improving the health of the people who took it .
That was the conclusion reached about the popular drug Vytorin in a study published online last week in the New England Journal of Medicine .
The results were a disappointment to the millions of patients who take Vytorin and the thousands of doctors who prescribe it ; a blow to its manufacturers , Merck & Co. and Schering - Plough Corp. , both of New Jersey ; and a surprise to many researchers -- though not all .
The study has raised questions , not only about this particular drug , but about the broader issue of how to treat and prevent heart disease .
Here are the answers to some of them .
Advertisement
What is Vytorin ?
Vytorin is a combination of two other cholesterol drugs : Zocor , a statin , and Zetia , a non-statin .
Statins work by limiting the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver .
They are the only drugs that have been proven to reduce the risk of bad coronary outcomes ( heart attacks , strokes and death ) .
Zetia works by blocking the absorption of cholesterol from food .
Advertisement
“ Vytorin creates a one - two punch , ” says Dr. Robert Bonow , chief of the cardiology division at Northwestern University and a past president of the American Heart Assn .
“ It blocks production and absorption . ”
Why mess with success ?
Are n’t statins good enough ?
Statins can have unpleasant , even dangerous side effects , including muscle pain and liver problems .
Not everyone can take them .
Besides , statins do n’t always succeed in getting cholesterol levels down to desired levels .
What are the desired cholesterol levels ?
Advertisement
They vary from patient to patient .
Guidelines issued by the National Cholesterol Education Program are endorsed by the American College of Cardiology , the American Heart Assn. and the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute and are widely followed by doctors .
But an editorial in the American Family Physician last year argued that these guidelines are “ expensive but not necessarily effective . ”
The editorial cites a 2006 study in the journal BMJ that compared guidelines in six countries .
The cholesterol education program ’s guidelines lead to treating twice as many patients as New Zealand ’s guidelines ( which were deemed most efficient ) without improving mortality rates .
“ They have us all on statins , ” says one of its authors , Dr. Jerome Hoffman , professor of medicine and emergency medicine at UCLA .
Advertisement
What exactly happened in the new study ?
The study -- called the Enhance trial -- compared Vytorin to Zocor alone .
Vytorin did better at lowering the levels of three undesirables : LDL cholesterol ( the so - called “ bad cholesterol ” ) , triglycerides and C - reactive proteins .
But researchers found no evidence that it did any better at lowering the big kahuna of undesirables : the risk of bad coronary outcomes .
Enhance did n’t actually measure the risk of bad outcomes though .
It measured a “ surrogate marker ” for bad outcomes -- the thickening of artery walls in the neck and leg .
Such thickening is caused by atherosclerosis , a disease that can lead to heart attacks , strokes and death .
Advertisement
Researchers expected that patients on Vytorin would have thinner artery walls than patients on Zocor alone .
That would have been evidence ( though not proof ) that Vytorin is better at preventing bad outcomes than Zocor alone .
But artery walls were equally thick for patients on both drugs .
Does that necessarily prove that Vytorin is not better at preventing bad outcomes than Zocor alone ?
No .
The Enhance study authors , among others , have suggested possible reasons why the trial was not definitive .
Here are two :
Advertisement
1 . The patients in the study all had extremely high levels of LDL cholesterol due to a genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia .
It ’s possible that Vytorin acts differently in patients who have this condition than in patients who do n’t .
Most patients with cholesterol problems do not have this condition .
2 . It ’s possible that thickening of artery walls is not a good surrogate marker for bad outcomes , at least not in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia .
( Most of the patients in this study had taken statins previously , and their artery walls were already quite thin .
Treating them with Vytorin may have been “ like using antibiotics on someone who does n’t have an infection , ” says Lee Davies , director of global product communications for Schering - Plough . )
“ I ’m not so strongly on the bandwagon to abandon this drug , ” says Dr. Stanley Rockson , professor of medicine and chief of consultative cardiology at Stanford University .
“ There ’s no evidence yet to say it does n’t work .
What we have is no evidence either way . ”
Should patients who take Vytorin stop taking it ?
Advertisement
No .
Enhance did not find any safety concerns associated with Vytorin , and experts agree it could be dangerous to suddenly stop taking the drug .
Patients who decide to stop taking Vytorin should do so only under their doctor ’s supervision .
Are there any general rules of thumb for patients to know until they can see their doctors ?
Here are a couple from Dr. Ravi Dave , a cardiologist and professor of medicine at UCLA :
1 . If you ’ve already tried taking statins , without success , “ Do n’t panic .
There ’s a reason why you ’re taking Vytorin . ”
Advertisement
2 . “ If you took Vytorin from Day 1 " -- i.e. , if you have never tried any other cholesterol drug -- maybe you should be taking a plain statin instead .
What about patients who take Zetia ?
If you ’ve never taken anything else , Dave says , it ’s possible you should be taking a statin .
If you ’re taking Zetia because you could n’t tolerate statins , it ’s possible you should be taking a different alternative .
Should doctors continue to prescribe Vytorin ?
Advertisement
Here is a general approach advocated by many doctors : Determine the cholesterol level a patient should reach .
Try to get there through diet , exercise and statins ( if necessary , in combination with other drugs known to be effective when added to statins ) .
Add Zetia only if , after all that , the patient still can’t reach the desired cholesterol level .
Is this a change from how doctors prescribed Vytorin before the Enhance results were reported ?
“ If physicians used Vytorin in the right way to begin with , there should be no change they have to make , ” Dave says .
Still , judging by Vytorin ’s popularity , many believe that for some patients , some doctors have been using it as a drug of first choice .
Advertisement
But many experts familiar with this study say doctors should n’t do that anymore .
How could Vytorin possibly fail to reduce bad outcomes more than Zocor alone when it reduces cholesterol more than Zocor alone ?
After all , reducing cholesterol reduces the risk of bad outcomes , right ?
“ There ’s something called the ‘ cholesterol hypothesis , ’ ” Hoffman says .
“ That ’s the idea that heart disease is caused by cholesterol .
But it ’s not called a hypothesis by everyone .
In most of society it ’s accepted as truth . ”
In fact , he says : “ There ’s no evidence anywhere that fixing your cholesterol helps you as a human being . ”
But do n’t statins reduce bad outcomes by fixing your cholesterol ?
Advertisement
“ Statins do make your cholesterol look ‘ better , ’ “ Hoffman says .
“ And in addition , in the right person , they do provide some meaningful benefit in terms of decreasing , by a very little , the chance of a truly bad outcome , such as a heart attack .
But these are almost certainly a case of ‘ true , true and unrelated . ’ ”
Not everyone agrees that improved outcomes are unconnected to improved cholesterol .
“ To say they ’re completely unrelated is far - fetched , ” Rockson says .
But he and many others believe statins affect many things , not just cholesterol levels .
Dr. James Liao , director of vascular medicine research at Brigham & Women ’s Hospital in Boston , has spent the last 12 years studying the non-cholesterol effects of statins , which he called “ pleiotropic effects . ”
One early indication that such effects exist came from stroke studies .
All statins reduce the risk of strokes , Liao says .
But they do n’t accomplish that by reducing cholesterol , because cholesterol is not related to strokes .
Advertisement
Some people may be unhappy these days that they ’ve been taking Vytorin .
Will there be other studies in which its value might be vindicated ?
Another larger study -- called Improve - It -- is underway .
The patients in this study are more representative of the general population , Schering - Plough ’s Davies says .
Also , it ’s a genuine “ outcome study ” -- i.e. , researchers will track actual bad outcomes , not just a surrogate marker for them .
When will this study be completed ?
It was originally scheduled to be completed in 2011 , but the enrollment of subjects was just recently expanded , and that is expected to delay completion for about a year .
Advertisement
What are the odds that Improve - It will improve on the results of Enhance ?
It depends on whom you ask .
Schering - Plough ’s Davies is very optimistic .
Liao of Brigham & Women ’s Hospital is less so .

In the article How to Build a Recession Proof Online Business , I suggested that a website could get 1,000 visitors in its first month after launch .
A number of readers contacted me to ask how they could achieve this .
So here is my answer with real data to illustrate each activity .
Like all marketing activities you first need to set goals and break the target into bite size chunks .
As the old saying goes :
“ The only way to eat an elephant is one mouthful at a time ”
So if we want to achieve 1,000 visitors , we need to get 34 people a day coming to your website ( 1,000 /30days ) .
Step # 1 – Create Some Fantastic Content
The first thing you MUST do is create and publish some excellent content .
Without this there is absolutely no point in driving traffic to your website .
Step # 2 – Open a Google Reader Account
Google Reader allows you to get all of the latest posts from all the best websites and blogs in your niche .
If you actively monitor what these sites are publishing you can jump in with comments quickly .
Have a look at this article to learn about setting up a free Google Reader account - http://www.subhub.com/articles/google-reader-how-to-use
Step # 3 – Create some Squidoo and Hubpages
Squidoo ( www.squidoo.com) and HubPages ( www.hubpages.com) are sites where you can create pages about your area of expertise .
Then link from these pages back to your website
Squidoo Example
Today ’s traffic ( according to Google Analytics ) from one Squidoo page was 30 visitors
And the traffic since the start of April from Squidoo is 380 visitors .
These visitors looked at an average of 3.13 pages on SubHub.com and stayed on the site for 4 minutes 47 seconds .
These figures suggest that these visitors were interested in the SubHub content and therefore are potential customers
Hubpages Example
Today ’s traffic from Hubpages is quite low at 6 visitors , but they looked at 4.5 pages each and stayed on the SubHub site for 3 minutes and 31 seconds which shows they are well targeted :
The Hubpages figures for all of April show 58 visitors .
Not a high number , but the quality of these visitors , indicated by the number of pages each one looked at ( 6.72 pages ) and the length of time they spend on the site ( 7 mins 12 secs ) , is very high .
Step # 4 - Comment on Relevant Blogs
Most blogs allow you to add comments to posts and include a link back to your website .
If you write carefully thought through comments which help the community , readers will click on links to articles on your site .
Here are a couple of examples of how well targeted comments on good quality blogs can generate good quality visitors .
I made this comment on ReadWriteWeb.com .
The link I included was relevant to the article content :
This comment generated 76 unique visitors to the SubHub site :
I also made this comment yesterday on the excellent Problogger blog ….
… and it generated 26 good quality visitors
If you make one good comment on an active blog every day you could generate between 600 and 1,000 visitors to your site in a month .
But it is not always possible to find 30 blog posts to comment on , so you should also participate in forums that are relevant to your niche subject .
Step # 5 – Add Posts to Forums
Generally comments on blogs generate more traffic than forum posts because they remain in place and are relevant for much longer .
A post on a very active forum may only stay on page one for a couple of hours .
However using forums you can generate traffic very quickly without much effort .
This is a post that was published by someone on the WarriorForum.com which includes a link to a SubHub article :

A recent audit of computer systems belonging to the South Australia Police has found that hundreds are being used to " share " films .
In a move smacking of hypocrisy though , officers involved will not be charged .
According to The Australian , during an audit of computer systems by the South Australian police force ’s IT branch , police computers belonging to hundreds of police officers were found to contain movies .
The origin of these movies is not clear , but it is probable that they ’ve been downloaded via p2p at some point , either on these systems , or on the personal systems of officers and transferred over .
Senior officials of the SA police force have been made aware of the findings , including its commissioner Mel Hyde .
However , police sources have told press that there will not be any investigation into this , citing the large numbers of police officers involved .
The Australian Federation against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) has said it will write to the commissioner to seek an explanation , presumably as to why the police officers are being let off with what it considers a heinous crime .
Quite ironically , AFACT boasts of “ working closely with police ” – perhaps this closeness has shown the police officers involved just how unimportant and meaningless this so - called ‘ crime ’ is in the grand scheme of things .
If the officers do go unpunished , it could create a favorable precedent for filesharers in South Australia .
If police officers , who are expected to be held to a greater level of accountability regarding the law , show this level of contempt for the current copyright laws , are unpunished , it will make it harder to convince a court that regular citizen should be punished for similar acts .
On the other hand , if the officers are punished under the law , which allows for upto AUS $ 60,500 ( About US $ 55,700 or 35,500 Euro ) per infringement and up to 5 years imprisonment , the ability to effectively police the state will be severely diminished .
Either way , this case will bring to a head the vastly disproportionate penalties for an act that , as yet , has never been proven to be even financially damaging .
One thing is certain , when even the police officers join large numbers of citizens in flouting such laws , the law ’s place in society should be called into serious question .
The South Australian police force had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication .

Venice is a top tourist destination
A man who allegedly photographed more than 3,000 women 's bottoms as they toured Venice has been arrested .
The man was stopped after police became suspicious of a large bag he was carrying as he followed women through St Mark 's Square .
He has been charged with infringement of privacy .
It is a crime which could earn this 38 - year - old Italian from six months to four years in jail .
A police video shows a man in jeans and hooded top walking behind women .
He is trying to position his black holdall close to their legs .
Police said he was filming through a small hole in the side of the bag .
The officers had become suspicious when they realised he was only following women with short skirts .
When they stopped or bent down to pick something up , he was clearly trying to angle the bag behind them .
When the voyeur was finally caught police recovered several DVDs which held more than 3,000 images of women 's bottoms .
He confessed to police he had been filming in and around St Mark 's Square for nearly two years .
Police have refused to name him but Mario Marina of Venice police said he is married with two young children and has a professional job in the nearby town of Padua .
He might have some explaining to do when he finally gets home .

自分の経験の枠組みは自分で変えられるか？というのは言いかえれば、「ユーザが自分の環境の構築に主体的に参加する」ということになると思うけど、この考え方の源流の一つとして次の話がある。
これは、今、流行ってるソフトウエア開発の方法論の源流にクリストファー・アレグザンダーという建築家の「パターンランゲージ」という概念がどのように影響を与えたかについて解説している講演だ。
何で建築家がソフトに関係してくるかと言うと、このアレグザンダーという人は、人が集まり都市が自然に生まれてくるようなプロセスでビルを建てることができないかということについて考えた人で、そのテーマがソフトウエアと本質的に関わってくるからだ。
つまり、設計者(開発者)がユーザの上に立って、上から目線で「おまえたちの欲しいものはこれだろう」と考えて作るのでは、ユーザにとって使いやすい都市(ソフト)はできないということ。
ビルもソフトも、使いやすいものを作るには、使う人が設計に関与することが絶対に必要であるというのが、「パターンランゲージ」の思想。
それを何 で 「パターンランゲージ」と呼ぶかと言えば、ユーザが設計に参加することをサポートするのが建築家(設計者)の役割でその道具が「パターンランゲージ」だから。そこをサポートする為には、
パターン=形を生み出すルール
ランゲージ=意図的に曖昧さを導入した記述
が必要であるということ。
Wikiを発明したウォード・カニンガムという人と、XPを提唱したケント・ベックという人は、二人とも、このアレグザンダーの「パターンランゲージ」に強い影響を受けている。
つまり 、WikiもXPも、設計者と利用者の関係を見直す為の方法論という性質がその中核にあるわけだ。Wikiは自分たちが使う文書を自分たちが作っていくということだし、XPの方も「エクストリームプログラミング入門」という最初の教科書的な本に「XPの目的は利用者と開発者の関係を見直し新たな社会構造を作ることである」と書いてある。
ソフト開発の本なのに、ちゃんと「社会構造」って書いてあるそうです*1。
このXPの思想のエッセンスを抜き出したのが「アジャイル」であり、その「アジャイル」の為の道具として使い勝手がいいというのが、Rubyが広まった一つの大きな要因なので、この考え方とRubyとも密接なつながりがあると見ていいと思う。
Rubyの場合は、プログラミング言語のユーザとしてのプログラマが、プログラミング言語(を中心としたソフトウエア開発全般の環境)の構築に参加するという意味で、利用者=設計者という側面を強く持っている。
そして 、Rubyもアジャイルも、効率の良さは評価されているものの、評判ほどにはビジネスの現場には導入されてない。
その理由は、どちらも歴史が浅く裾野に広がってないということもあるけど、何より「利用者=設計者」という前提が、確かに社会構造にとってラディカルな変革を要求するからだろう。企業というのは、システムを提供する側かそれを使う側かどちらか一方の役割に自分を限定したがるものだが、それだとRubyもアジャイルもうまく使えない。マニュアルが整備されてないとか資格試験がないとか解決が可能である問題もたくさんあるが、根本の思想レベルにおける葛藤という、簡単にはカタがつかない問題もそこにはある。
関係者一同が一つのプロセスに参加するという意識が必要なのだ。
と言っても、意識だけでは単なる精神論になってしまう。
江渡さんの講演で一番印象に残ったのは、「意図的な曖昧さの導入」という所。アレグザンダーは最初、デザインを数学的に記述するという試みをしていて、それから「パターンランゲージ」に方向転換したそうだ。
つまり、デザインと一意の価値観は両立しないということだと思う。ビルの設計にユーザが参加すると言っても、その設計要素一つ一つについて、ユーザ各人が与える意味は一致しない。同じものに違う意味を見ながら合意していく為の道具がパターンランゲージであり、「意図的な曖昧さの導入」なのだろう。
I have been privileged enough to carry the Olympic torch before , four years ago , but for me Sunday 's relay is a more important event as it signals the start of the run-up to our games in 2012 .
At the end of the games in Beijing , the Olympic flag will be passed to London .
For most of my life I have been involved in the Olympics .
I 've been lucky , I 've competed at five , been a journalist at one and spectator at two others .
Since the age of 13 it has been my driving ambition to win an Olympic medal .
So now , having achieved that ambition , I spend my time ensuring that young athletes get the chance to compete and win an Olympic medal .
The torch for me is not , therefore , simply about a relay around London , it is a moment where the Olympics comes to the front of everyone 's mind and we celebrate the dedication of the young athletes who train day in , day out to get to the games .
The torch relay gives the opportunity for people from all walks of life to touch the Olympics , to feel the dream .
The games are an experience like no other , but only a few people get to go and experience their magic .
That is why on Sunday I am so pleased that one quarter of the torchbearers will be from London schools .
They will get a once in a lifetime opportunity to carry the Olympic torch .
Every Olympic games I 've been involved in has had political issues .
In 1980 I could n't compete at the Moscow Olympics because of the US boycott over Afghanistan .
I think people have realised athletes are a cheap hit , a way to get publicity for whatever cause they 're trying to fight for .
People should n't use athletes who have trained hard to make political points .
The sports boycott did not end apartheid in South Africa .
That came through financial sanctions .
As a sportsman I am happy to stand side by side with my government if there are sanctions .
But there are no sanctions restricting our financial dealings with China .
If the issues are strong enough that the nation and government want to take a stand together against another country , sportspeople should stand with that , but they should not be misused to make a point .
Athletes are trying to come away an Olympic champion .
To win a medal at Beijing will not make you a Beijing Olympic champion .
It will make you an Olympic champion and we should encourage athletes to strive for that .
The Olympics is a unique event and we should celebrate that fact as the torch which marks the start of that Olympic event comes to the streets of London this weekend .

Home of the Mean Green Screen : Yahoo !
March 3rd , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
What does it take to encourage , empower , or help an office go green ?
How about a touch - screen kiosk with real - time energy usage and tools to see your individual impact ?
Yahoo ! has unveiled the Green Screen where employees can play with data to see how much energy they could save with simple changes around the office .
If successful , Yahoo! hopes to spread this power ( ful ) tool from the cafeteria of their Sunnyvale headquarters to their other campuses so employees can discover how easy habits , like turning off that monitor , can make a big difference .
The Green Screen is the latest initiative by Yahoo ! ’s volunteer Green Team that illustrates the corporation ’s dedication to positive environmental change .
The Internet giant has already pledged to go carbon neutral and spawned a number of green projects ( complete with celebrity support ) , initiatives , and even a philanthropic search engine .
Yahoo !
Green has been the hub of their eco-friendly services since its launch in May 2007 .
As a computer - based Internet business , issues of energy efficiency and e-waste are their central environmental concerns .
Yahoo !
is well known for its philosophy that we can make a difference through corporate , employee , and consumer action .
Co-founder David Filo explained the company ’s commitment to walking the walk and talking the talk .
He once told Collin Dunn of TreeHugger.com :
We ’ve been focusing on things like energy efficiency throughout the company , whether that ’s in our offices and reducing air conditioning in the summer months , or in the data centers , making our servers more energy efficient and making our cooling more energy efficient … but we ’re always looking for other ideas from outside people , or inside people , on ways that as a corporation , we can reduce our footprint .
Internal efforts are compounded with efforts to get everyday people involved .
Yahoo ! has sponsored a number of contests for users to create icons and commercials for the company ’s green services .
David Filo believes that as individuals we can make a difference because even our small personal efforts add up to a big change .
“ We want to convince people that either do n’t know about global warming , have n’t thought about it , or are n’t convinced they can make a difference , that you can take a lot of these changes , and although it may seem insignificant at the individual level , they will add up , and we ’ll see significant change from it . ”
The Green Screen reflects that sentiment and the ideal that we , as individuals , can be major agents of change .
Even if you ca n’t go carbon neutral , you can still join millions of people around the world in saving the planet .
If an international corporation can do it , how hard can it be ?
For tips on how to take small ( or large ) steps towards greening your lifestyle , take a few tips from Yahoo !.

Slate 's John Dickerson asks an obvious question on a conference call with Hillary Clinton 's campaign : " What foreign policy moment would you point to in Hillary 's career where she 's been tested by crisis ? "
After an uncomfortably long moment during which neither Mark Penn , Howard Wolfson and Lee Feinstein have anything to say , and then Lee Feinstein tries to step in with a save and starts talking about Clinton 's endorsement by high - level military officials .
Give it a listen :
That 's a hat tip to Jennifer Skalka .
Feinstein , the campaign 's foreign policy guy , is making the best of a bad situation here .
But the more strictly political people walked into a debacle .
How could they go forward with that ad without having a good answer to the question on hand ?

How soon we forget the blockbuster ABC News scoop that was - and then was n't - much bigger and more explosive than Governor Spitzer 's , because it alleged Dick Cheney was a client .
In fact , when the news broke , Bush 's " AIDS Czar " Randall Tobias , a former Eli Lilly top exec , resigned in shame .
He should have stalled a bit like Louisiana Senator David Vitter did - the story was going to be killed , according to Wayne Madsen who named the ABC employee that pulled the plug after White House pressure .
Madsen expanded on the story after ABC dropped it , to allege that convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff was a client , as well as a lawyer in Rudy Giuliani 's firm .
Senator Vitter has admitted and apologized for his part in he scandal , but is still in office , likely to be subpoenaed in the Spring 2008 trial of Madam Deborah Jeane Palfrey .

The attached shareholder proposal for ConocoPhillips demonstrates a methodology that other people should consider to expose corrupt politicians and the corporate executives who support them .
Following the collapse of the USSR , the US Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) groped for justification of its bloated budget .
The CIA found that elected officials were willing to continue the flow of money to the obsolete �intelligence � organ ( for �work � that was largely unsupervised by the US Congress ) if the CIA cooperated with the politicians largest campaign contributors -- large multinational corporations .
The most cooperative candidates were the large multinational petroleum companies and telecommunications corporations because many of the executives with these corporations had access to high - level government officials in states where the academics and / or former military hired - killers that populated the CIA could not operate � such as Iran , Libya , Somalia , Nigeria , Angola , etc .
Subsequently , the perverse situation developed where in public politicians would articulate US foreign policy that demand no US corporations should engage in business in a state like Libya or Iran , however in secret , these same politicians would direct �rogue� elements ( one always needs to have a �plausible denial� defense to fall back upon ) within the CIA and the CIA subsidiary , the Department of State , to turn a blind - eye to the activities of certain preferred US corporations , like ConocoPhillips .
The CIA bureaucrats got their blotted budgets and the intelligence that tax payers paid to get was obtained at the expense of the shareholders ( pension funds , etc. ) of the �chosen� corporations .
As quid pro quo , the chosen corporations � executives gained immunity from prosecution for their illegal business dealings with high - level government officials of the putative rogue state who , starved for business relations with the rest of the world by the US imposed sanctions , are forced to take whatever deal the chosen corporation offers .
Sadly , the average citizen of the putative rogue state making the deals with the chosen corporation have a better understanding of the politics of the scam than do most so - called �journalist� in the US .
Recently , the illegal recording of conversations and email correspondence between US citizens within the United States by telecommunications corporations has been in the news .
The Bush - Cheney Administration has attempted to quickly push through legislation that will retroactively grant immunity from civil law suits against the telecommunications corporations who were complicit in these privacy violations against persons known only to the telecommunications corporations ( defendants ) and the US government bureaucrats who directed the illegal eavesdropping operation .
The attached shareholder proposal shows another avenue of attack against rogue corporations like these telecommunications corporations and ConocoPhillips .
Both the eavesdropping telecommunications corporations and ConocoPhillips have engaged in activities that waste shareholder resources in carrying out activities that are outside of the corporations � charters as public companies and that also expose the corporations to enormous civil liabilities .
When these activities are discovered by investors at large the companies � share price decreases , sometimes dramatically as in the case of Enron .
Shareholders have a right to information regarding material changes in the business dealings of their corporation � it is fraud for a public corporation�s board of directors to secretly change the corporation�s charter and not tell shareholder .
As demonstrated by the ConocoPhillips response to the attached shareholder proposal uncovering this kind of fraud faces a great deal or resistance by the antibodies ( lawyers ) of the corporate immune system who have spent a lot of ( shareholder ) money on outside lawyers to suppress the proposal from shareholder consideration .
The corporation�s in - house and out - house lawyers will undoubtedly use their substantial influence with the lawyers at the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) ( many of whom do the SEC work to build credentials for very lucrative lawyer - jobs in the private sector ) to quash publication in the ConocoPhillips proxy material on or about March 31 , 2008 .
However , if enough shareholders find out about the issue and call or write to the SEC , the issue has a chance of getting on the agenda for Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 14 , 2008 .
The New York Times is laying off 15 journalists after the company acknowledged it fell short of its goal of getting 100 people to take voluntary buyout packages .
The axing is the first - ever mass firing of journalists in the paper ’s 157 - year history .
The company would not confirm the precise number of layoffs , but in a memo Executive Editor Bill Keller said the ax would fall on “ relatively small numbers ” of staffers .
“ While the overwhelming majority of our reductions did indeed come from volunteers , we have been forced to resort to a relatively small number of layoffs to meet our assigned goal , ” Keller said in the memo .
He said he hopes this will be the end of the newsroom cuts .
“ There are , of course , no guarantees , but so far , nothing in the company ’s performance or in the forecasts for the economy at large suggest we will be going through this again anytime soon , ” he wrote .
Insiders said the business and national desks were spared , while the metro desk , particularly its suburban bureaus , were hit .
As of the April 22 deadline to accept the voluntary buyout package , insiders estimated that only about 70 people had stepped forward .
The cutbacks could have been worse .
In December , about 13 editorial support staffers and clerks were let go .
Those cuts were counted toward the company ’s goal of slashing 100 jobs .
It ’s nearing that time of year : the official season of standing on the shoreline while the waves nibble away the sand from between your bare toes .
But while you ’re there , kneel down – because sand is beautiful .
What you ’re looking at is the same dull beige grains you see at the beach , in your car and clinging to your towel , in that order .
From where you stand up there , sand grains blend together into the colour of …. well , sand .
But lay your hands on a 3D microscope as Gary Greenberg has , and sand becomes a series of richly coloured microcosms .
It ’s a jumbled record of thousands of years of our sedimentary and volcanic environment ( look at the amazing photos here , over at Discover ) .
Greenberg has assembled all his work into A Grain Of Sand : Nature ’s Secret Wonder ( Amazon listing here ) .
But we humans have our ways too .
Take the Buddhist tradition of making sand mandalas .
The Tibetan monks in the above picture are using the traditional metal funnel known as the chak - pur .
It ’s filled with colored sand , and when a metal rod is scraped along one ridged side , the vibration makes the sand run out like a tiny stream of water …
The results can be astonishing .

About 50 injured survivors of the explosion were rushed to two hospitals
At least 24 people have been killed and about 50 wounded by a bombing on a bus in the outskirts of the Sri Lankan capital , Colombo , officials have said .
The blast happened during rush hour while the bus stopped to pick up passengers in the city 's southern suburb of Piliyandala , they added .
A government spokesman blamed the Tamil Tiger rebel group .
Violence in Sri Lanka has intensified since January , when the government pulled out of a ceasefire agreement .
Earlier , the military said its troops had taken control of a church containing the country 's most important Roman Catholic shrine .
The shrine lies on the front line in the town of Madhu in the northern Mannar region .
Both sides in the conflict have recently accused each other of shelling the revered complex , and photographs have shown considerable damage .
' Cowardly act '
The government spokesman , Lakshman Hulugalle , told the BBC that a parcel bomb was left inside the vehicle packed with people returning home from work .
It is horrible , I saw many people laying on the ground
RB Dharmasiry

The bomb exploded as the bus pulled away from a stop , blowing off the roof and shattering windows on the bus and those of nearby buildings , reports said .
" There was a massive explosion , I could n't open my eyes .
There was black smoke everywhere , there was blood pouring from my head , " Ananda Ratnasiri , the bus driver , told AFP news agency .
Mr Hulugalle blamed the Tamil Tigers for what he called a " cowardly attack on civilians " .
A police spokesman said 10 people died on the spot and another 14 died while being taken to hospital .
A child and a Buddhist monk were among the dead .
Fifty - two wounded people were being treated at two hospitals , the spokesman added .
Witnesses described a large fireball coming out of the bus .
" It is horrible , I saw many people laying on the ground , " RB Dharmasiry told the Associated Press news agency .

The rebels , who are fighting for an independent state for the Tamil minority , have not commented on the blast .
This is the first attack where there has been major loss of life since 6 April , when a suicide bomber killed 14 people , including a government minister , in the western district of Grampaha .
In February , two separate attacks on buses killed at least 20 in northern Sri Lanka and injured 18 people in a Colombo suburb .
The attack comes as government forces continue a campaign against the Tigers in territory they control in the north of the island .
On Wednesday , the two sides fought a fierce battle in the Jaffna peninsula .
The military said it left more than 80 soldiers dead or missing but insisted the rebels had lost even more fighters , as well as their first line of defences .
The rebels said they had repulsed the military 's advance and inflicted a defeat on the government forces .
At least 70,000 people have died since the civil war began in 1983 .

What are these ?
Over the last five weeks , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York has featured in her campaign stump speeches the story of a health care horror : an uninsured pregnant woman who lost her baby and died herself after being denied care by an Ohio hospital because she could not come up with a $ 100 fee .
The woman , Trina Bachtel , did die last August , two weeks after her baby boy was stillborn at O’Bleness Memorial Hospital in Athens , Ohio .
But hospital administrators said Friday that Ms. Bachtel was under the care of an obstetrics practice affiliated with the hospital , that she was never refused treatment and that she was , in fact , insured .
“ We implore the Clinton campaign to immediately desist from repeating this story , ” said Rick Castrop , chief executive officer of the O’Bleness Health System .
Linda M. Weiss , a spokeswoman for the not - for - profit hospital , said the Clinton campaign had never contacted the hospital to check the accuracy of the story , which Mrs. Clinton had first heard from a Meigs County , Ohio , sheriff ’s deputy in late February .
A friend of mine is 45 years old , has no gray hair , and very good skin for her age .
I wanted to find out if there was anything in her routine that could have been a reason for such youthful looks for her age ( all without any surgery by the way ! ) .
Leaving genetics out of the equation for a moment , the one interesting thing that popped up was the fact that she takes a cold shower every morning .
So I did a little research about the subject and found 4 main benefits that you gain by taking cold showers .
Now when I say cold shower , I want to clarify exactly what I mean by that .
Taking a full cold shower , meaning no hot or warm or lukewarm water at all , is borderline torture !
Especially in the cold winter months ( I am from Montreal , and it is VERY cold here ! ) .
Besides , there are many benefits to taking a warm shower , the primary one being that it feels really good !
But seriously , what I mean in this context , is the practice of starting with a warm shower , and ending the last few minutes with cool to cold water .
Here are the benefits that you gain by incorporating a cold shower into your shower routine :
1- Better Circulation
Warm water makes the blood rush to your skin , and cool water makes the blood rush to your organs .
This switching between hot and cold triggers better circulation in your blood by forcing the blood to move .
The ideal practice would be to switch numerous times between hot and cold water , but merely ending the shower with cold water does help with circulation .
Why should you worry about having good circulation ?
Well , it prevents such problems as hypertension , hardening of the arteries , and the appearance of varicose veins .
Good circulation improves the performance of your system and thus help looking and feeling better .
2- Better looking skin
When you shower with warm water , it opens up your pores .
Then you wash and this cleans up your pores .
That ’s all good .
When you end , it would be best to close your pores and cold water does just that .
It ’s good to close your pores after you are all cleaned up because it will prevent the pores from being easily clogged by dirt and oil , which causes skin imperfections such as acne for example .
Another benefit is that cold water makes your blood vessels constrict which reduces swelling and the appearance of dark circles under your eyes ( where skin is at its thinnest ) .
This provides you with a young , healthy glow .
3- Healthier hair
Cold water makes your hair look healthier and shinier .
As a matter of fact , cool air makes your hair shinier too ( that ’s why there is a cool air button on your hair dryer ) .
What the cold water does is that it closes the cuticle which makes the hair stronger and prevents dirt from easily accumulating within your scalp .
Basically , the same principle with how it closes the pores of your skin as mentioned above .
Stronger hair , of course , prevents hair from being easily pulled out when you are combing , and it helps in slowing down overall hair loss .
4- Mental benefits
There are plenty of mental benefits to ending your shower with cold water .
The ancient samurai warriors used to pour buckets of cold river water on their heads every morning in a Shinto practice called Misogi .
This was a purification ritual on a spiritual level .
They believe that it cleansed their spirit and helped start a new day & new adventure fresh .
Cold water obviously helps waking you up , which is what you want in the morning .
Also , it energizes you and invigorates your entire being with the essence of life .
Give it a try , you will definitely feel more alive !
It can also lift you up if you are feeling a little down or unmotivated .
Ending your shower with cold water clearly has its advantages .
Many benefits to cold showers , as you can see .
I know this is something that can be very difficult for many people to do .
The key is to not torture yourself .
Go about it gradually .
Start with a level of cold you can deal with , and slowly make it colder after each shower .
As long as you get your feet wet ( no pun intended ! ) , and begin adding this routine at the end of your showers , you will be on your way to making a habit out of it and enjoy the benefits that this practice can bring you .
Who knows , maybe you can avoid gray hair altogether like my friend !
Maybe the fountain of youth is made up of very cold water ?! 😉

What if a single nation on this planet were to pour more resources into its military than the rest of the nations combined , set up military bases in 80 percent of the other nations , stockpile more nuclear weapons than all other nations combined , develop new nuclear weapons intended for aggressive first - strike use , completely dominate the militarization of space , erase any policy lines between space and ground warfare and between nuclear and conventional weapons , and establish the goal of being able to quickly destroy any target anywhere on earth in order to protect its military and corporate investments ?
I know what you 're thinking : " Those Iranians may be evil , but I did n't know they 'd advanced as far as all that .
Do they still wear turbans ? "
I do n't know how to break this to you , so I 'm just going to say it :
The nation that has done everything I mentioned is the United States of America .
Now , here 's a second riddle for you :
What if the United States of America were to establish a command center outside of the Pentagon from which to run Bush and Cheney 's illegal spying programs , the targeting of targets around the globe via satellite , and the full range of aggressive nuclear and conventional warfare , a command center that will control the next war against Iran or whatever other nation is chosen ?
Where would that Strategic Command center be located ?

Mr. Obama ’s campaign says it has taken pains to discourage these efforts on its behalf , and in fact the campaign has no recourse in controlling them .
“ We do not think people should be donating to 527s , ” said Bill Burton , a campaign spokesman .
“ We would rather have them involved in our campaign .
It is our hope that anyone who supports Obama does so directly through his campaign and not through these outside groups . ”
The Clinton campaign , which has not made an issue of outside help , has been a much greater beneficiary of these groups .
Mrs. Clinton has large unions representing government employees and teachers on her side , as well as the politically savvy feminist organization Emily ’s List .
The two unions plan to spend millions of dollars on her behalf through direct mail , phone banks and get - out - the - vote efforts in Super Tuesday states .
The teachers ’ union , which has 1.4 million members , has budgeted $ 3 million for the effort , while the government employees ’ union has earmarked $ 5 million .
Meanwhile , Emily ’s List has an effort directed at women just outside the New York City media market .
Mr. Obama has lined up support from unions representing plumbers and pipefitters , as well as hospitality and garment workers .
One union , Unite Here , plans to mobilize its 450,000 members through direct mail advertisements , phone banks and door - to - door visits in Super Tuesday states .
It will also continue efforts , begun in Nevada , to run pro-Obama television and radio spots , many in Spanish and aimed at voters in California .
The plumbers ’ and pipefitters ’ union , which has 340,000 members , said it was working with the Obama campaign to get out its membership and was encouraging members to donate time as Obama campaign volunteers .
Unlike 527s , unions can coordinate some activities with campaigns , and spending by their political action committees must be reported to federal regulators .
“ A lot of girls do it , ” said an 18 - year - old named Sara al - Tukhaifi who explained that a girl and her friends might cross - dress , sneaking thobes out of a brother ’s closet , then challenge each other to enter the Saudi male sphere in various ways , by walking nonchalantly up to the men-only counter in a McDonalds , say , or even by driving .
“ It ’s just a game , ” Ms. Tukhaifi said , although detention by the religious police is always a possibility .
“ I have n’t done it myself , but those two are really good at it .
They went into a store and pretended to be looking at another girl  they even got her to turn her face away . ”
Grinning , Ms. Tukhaifi mimicked the gesture , pressing her face into the corner of her hijab with exaggerated pretend modesty while her classmate Shaden giggled .
Saudi newspapers often lament the rise of rebellious behavior among young Saudis .
There are reports of a recent spate of ugly confrontations between youths and the religious police , and of a supposed increase in same - sex love affairs among young people frustrated at the strict division between the genders .
And certainly , practices like “ numbering ”  where a group of young men in a car chase another car they believe to contain young women , and try to give the women their phone number via Bluetooth , or by holding a written number up to the window  have become a very visible part of Saudi urban life .
Flirting by Phone
A woman ca n’t switch her phone ’s Bluetooth feature on in a public place without receiving a barrage of the love poems and photos of flowers and small children which many Saudi men keep stored on their phones for purposes of flirtation .
And last year , Al Arabiya television reported that some young Saudis have started buying special “ electronic belts , ” which use Bluetooth technology to discreetly beam the wearer ’s cellphone number and e-mail address at passing members of the opposite sex .

Ms. Tukhaifi and Shaden know of girls in their college who have passionate friendships , possibly even love affairs , with other girls but they say that this , like the cross - dressing , is just a “ game ” born of frustration , something that will inevitably end when the girls in question become engaged .
And they and their friends say that they find the experience of being chased by boys in cars to be frightening , and insist that they do not know any girl who has actually spoken to a boy who contacted her via Bluetooth .

What will a Hillary Clinton presidency look like ?
The answer by now seems obvious :
It will look like her presidential campaign , which in turn looks increasingly like the first Clinton presidency .
Which is to say , high - minded ideals , lowered execution , half truths , outright lies ( and imaginary flights ) , take - no prisoners politics , some very good policy ideas , a presidential spouse given to wallowing in anger and self - pity , and a succession of aides and surrogates pushed under the bus when things do n’t go right .
Which is to say , often .
And endless psychodrama : the essential Clintonian experience that mesmerizes the press , confuses the citizenry , confounds members of both parties in Congress ( not to mention the Clintons themselves , at times ) and pretty much keeps the rest of the world constantly amused and fixated .
Such a picture of Clinton Redux is , by definition , speculation .
But it is speculation based on the best evidence at hand : the demonstrable and familiar record of Hillary and Bill Clinton coupled together in Permanent Campaign - mode for a generation , waging a continuous fight on the national political stage since 1992 , an unceasing campaign for the White House , for redemption , for their ideas ( sometimes ) and for themselves ( almost always ) , especially in 2008 .
The basic dynamics of the campaign , except for the Clintons ’ vast new - found personal wealth and its challenges , have been near - constant since they arrived in Washington : through Whitewater , health care , the battle of the budget , the culture wars , the tax returns released only under duress , the travel office , Monica , impeachment , the pardons and through Hillary Clinton ’s often repugnant presidential campaign .
In many ways , the characteristic tone , secrecy , and resilience of the Clinton political march have been determined more by Hillary Clinton than by her husband , reflecting her deepest attributes and attitudes , fermented in recognition of the antipathy held against both of them , and often , the foul tactics of their enemies .
As an aide put it ( quoted in my book , A Woman In Charge : the Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton ) :
“ She does n’t look at her life as a series of crises but rather a series of
battles .
I think of her viewing herself in more heroic terms , an epic
character like in The Iliad , fighting battle after battle .
Yes , she succumbs
to victimization sometimes , in that when the truth becomes
too painful , when she is faced with the repercussions of her own
mistakes or flaws , she falls into victimhood .
But that ’s a last resort
and when she does allow the wallowing it ’s only in the warm glow
of martyrdom — as a laudable victim — a martyr in the tradition of
Joan of Arc , a martyr in the religious sense .
She would much
rather play the woman warrior — whether it ’s against the bimbos ,
the press , the other party , the other candidate , the right - wing .
She ’s happiest when she ’s fighting , when she has identified the
enemy and goes into attack mode .
. . .
That ’s what she thrives on
more than anything — the battle . ”
The latest transmutation of leadership in the campaign of Hillary Clinton for president –- Mark Penn ’s departure or non-departure , be it window dressing or window cleaning –- is perhaps the best index we have of the more absurd aspects of her candidacy and evidence of its increasing bankruptcy .
The Clinton folks asserted to donors and reporters alike that this second “ shake - up ” in eight weeks at the very top of the campaign apparat represents some kind of great electoral moment , an opportunity for Hillary to state her case “ more positively , ” as if the negative approach had been forced on her ; the beginning of yet another “ turnaround ” as if Penn , rather than Hillary ( and Bill ) , has been the big problem .
As if Penn were not an appendage of his two patrons , as if he were some kind of independent contractor twisting the candidate ’s arm to do what comes unnaturally to her .
The willingness of so much of the press , sensitized to the Clintons ’ off - center complaints about one - sided coverage , to buy into this line is stunning .
In fact , the demotion of Penn –- like the departure of Hillary ’s acolyte Patty Solis Doyle as campaign manager –- is a confession that , for all her claims of “ experience ” and leadership abilities , Hillary Clinton has now presided over two disastrous national enterprises , the most important professional undertakings of her adult life , both of which she began with ample wind at her back : the healthcare reform of her husband ’s presidency , and now her own campaign for the White House .
These two failures -– and the demonizing of her opponents in both instances –- may be the best indication of the kind of President she would be , especially when confronted ( inevitably ) by unanticipated difficulty and / or entrenched opposition to her ideas and programs .
It is exactly under such circumstances that she usually resorts to the worst excesses that mark her in full warrior - mode - and all its scorched - earth , truth - be - damned manifestations .
Bosnia , anyone ?
Smearing the women involved ( or even thought to be involved ) sexually with her husband .
Responding to Barack Obama with the same mindset , disdain , and arsenal as she did Karl Rove and Lee Atwater , as if Obama ’s politics and methodologies were as mendacious and vicious as theirs–and her own .
Tax information kept secret ( in 1992 to hide her profits from trading in cattle futures ; in 2008 to shield the identities of Bill ’s foreign clients . )
A campaign that openly boasts of throwing “ the kitchen sink ” at her opponent .
What you see is what you get : Hillary ’s cynical view of the larger interests of the Democratic Party , exhibited in her 3 a. m. red telephone ad .
And her simultaneous , incongruous suggestion that Barack Obama –- notwithstanding his supposed lack of national security qualifications to be commander - in - chief - – would make a good vice president on her ticket .
And , yes , a sense of entitlement that veritably shouts , “ Look , because I believe in good things , and because of all I ’ve been through , I deserve to win this . ”
And yet , there is no denying that , compared to the Bush years , the accomplishments of the Clinton presidency , in which she was an elemental force ( and generalissimo in the often successful fight against the forces of “ the vast right - wing conspiracy ” ) are prodigious , marked by peace and prosperity , whatever the price of the Clintons ’ methodologies and personal failings .
In projecting what a Hillary Clinton presidency would look like , there is the conundrum of her senatorial tenure and what had appeared to be a surcease in her Pavlovian resort to trench warfare : a period in which -– until the day drew near for her to announce her presidential candidacy –- she seemed ( to her oldest friends , certainly ) happier and more at ease , and straightforward in her public dealings , and less guarded , than at any point in her life since she followed Bill Clinton to Arkansas .
Hillary Clinton ’s unique star power , her performance as a senator and fundraiser on behalf of her party are what gave legitimacy to the idea that she might be a credible presidential candidate : all premised on her changed demeanor in the Senate years , compared to her embattled tenure as first lady .
As a steward of her state ’s interest , and a patient student of senatorial compromise and collegiality , she was widely commended by former skeptics in Congress and the press .
True , her most revealing moment as a senator of national consequence was the vote she cast to authorize George W. Bush to go to war , which she ’s been trying to explain since with dubious credibility .
( “ If I knew now what I knew then , ” etc . )
Twenty - one of her fellow Democratic senators had no doubts about what Bush intended , and voted against the authorization .
The second most revealing moment was her endorsement of legislation to make flag - burning illegal , the kind of pandering she once attacked right - wing Republicans of practicing .
Meanwhile , she and her husband have regularly misrepresented their own postures and statements in the run-up to the war , as well as Obama ’s record , with Bill Clinton claiming to have been against the war from the start , and Hillary saying she has consistently been more adamant in her opposition than Obama -– except for the matter of his single “ speech ” against the war before it started .
The assumption of many senatorial colleagues , former Clinton aides , and reporters ( including this one ) was that her presidential campaign would be much different from the one she and Bill Clinton waged through the White House years .
In A Woman in Charge , I wrote about her ability to evolve , observable especially in the years before she met Bill Clinton and in the Senate : to learn from her mistakes .
Events have proven me wrong on that count .
The 2008 Clinton campaign , in fact , has been an exercise in devolution , back to the angry , demonizing , accusatory Hillary Clinton of the worst days of the Clinton presidency , flailing , and furtive , and disingenuous ; and , as in the White House years , putting forth programs and ideas worthy of respect and deserving of the kind of substantive debate she claims she wants her race against Barrack Obama to be based upon .
Bill , meanwhile , has taken up Hillary ’s old role as defender and apologist , with disinformation and misinformation , but ( far less effectively than she defended him ) .
Also with near - apoplectic tirades that have left their friends worried and wondering .
In the process of their search - and - destroy mission against Barack Obama , the Clintons have pursued a strategy that at times seems deliberately aimed at undermining Obama ’s credibility if he becomes John McCain ’s opponent — heresy in the view of an increasing number of the Clintons ’ former suppporters and aides , a suprising number of whom now back Obama .
The choice ahead -– in Pennsylvania , and the remaining primary states , and for the super delegates , and perhaps even the arbiters of a deadlocked convention -– is clear enough at this point , at least in terms of what the 2008 Clinton campaign is about : the Clintons - plural .
Theirs is a campaign for Restoration to the White House , not simply the election of Hillary Clinton .
Theirs is , has always been , a joint enterprise , a see - saw routine in which the psyches and actions of each balances the board according to the personal dynamics of the moment .
A long - time associate of the Clintons , with whom Hillary has consulted in their quest to return to the White House , said early in her campaign : “ She has a very plausible case for president .
She had an eight - year super - graduate course in the presidency , a progressive platform … ”
He paused , and added : “ [ But ] I ’m not sure I want the circus back in town . ”
That is what the Hillary for President campaign has become : the whole Clinton three - ring circus , with little evidence that moving back to the White House will alter that most basic fact .

In 1993 , when Travis Hofmann was a freshman of 15 , he had traveled little beyond the sand hills that surrounded his hometown , Alliance , Neb .
He was the son of a railroad engineer , a trumpeter in the high school band , with a part - time job changing the marquee and running the projector at the local movie theater .
In Travis ’s class in global geography at Alliance High School , however , the teacher introduced the outside world with the word and concept of genocide .
The teacher , Tim Walz , was determined that even in this isolated place , perhaps especially in this isolated place , this county seat of 9,000 that was hours away from any city in any direction , the students should learn how and why a society can descend into mass murder .
Mr. Walz had already taught for a year in China , and he brought the world into his classroom in the form of African thumb pianos and Tibetan singing bowls .
For the global geography class , he devised something far more ambitious than what the curriculum easily could have been  the identification and memorization of capitals , mountain ranges and major rivers .
It was more ambitious , too , than a unit solely on the Holocaust of the sort many states have required .
“ The Holocaust is taught too often purely as a historical event , an anomaly , a moment in time , ” Mr. Walz said in a recent interview , recalling his approach .
“ Students understood what had happened and that it was terrible and that the people who did this were monsters .
CHARLOTTE , N.C. –
The pilot of a US Airways plane may have mishandled a firearm that went off in flight , piercing a hole in the cockpit wall , a federal air marshal said Tuesday .
" This is an extremely safe and reliable weapon , " said Greg Alter of the Federal Air Marshal Service .
" It 's not going to discharge on its own , is the bottom line . "
The pistol – a .40 - calibre semiautomatic H&K USP – discharged Saturday aboard Flight 1536 from Denver to Charlotte , as the plane was approaching to land .
Photos obtained by The Associated Press show a small entry hole in the lower side of the cockpit wall and a small exit hole on the exterior below the cockpit window .
The AP described the photos and the bullet hole to US Airways spokesman Phil Gee , who said " they sound authentic . "
Airline officials have said the accidental discharge Saturday did not endanger the 124 passengers and five crew members on board , although air safety experts said Tuesday the shot could have caused the plane to rapidly depressurize had it hit a window at a higher altitude .
" There are two issues : would they ( the crew ) have enough oxygen to remain alert , " said Earl Dowell , an aeronautical engineering professor at Duke University .
" If the crew could no longer control the airplane , that would be a big deal .
And the rapid loss of pressure might damage the structure itself . "
But both Dowell and Fu-Kuo Chang , a professor of aeronautical engineering at Stanford University , said that airplane design emphasizes safety and that such a blast – even if it knocked out a window in mid-flight , is n't likely to cause the kind of damage that would lead immediately to a crash .
" If not repaired , it may cause a problem .
It could get bigger .
For a single bullet , it would not be a factor for the safety of the airplane , " Chang said .
" If it hit the window , it may be a problem for depressurization .
I still do n't think it would cause a crash . "
Dowell pointed to a 1988 Aloha Airlines flight in Hawaii in which the roof of the jet ripped off after an explosive decompression at 7,300 metres .
A flight attendant was blown out of the plane , but the passengers – many of whom were injured – remained strapped in their seats , and the pilot safely landed the aircraft .
" If they lost a window , the people near that window would have been substantially uncomfortable , " Dowell said .
" You probably would n't have crashed the airplane .
But there could have been some frightened people . "
The gunshot marked the first time a pilot 's weapon has been fired on a plane since the flight deck officer program was created following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , Alter said .
The Transportation Security Administration is investigating how the gun discharged , and Gee says the unidentified pilot has been taken off duty during the investigation .
Pilots in the program undergo 50 hours of training at the federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Artesia , N.M.
Alter said it appears the pilot of the US Airways flight was n't following " proper procedures .
...
We just do n't know exactly what procedure was n't being followed . "
Since April 2003 , about 5,000 flight deck officers – captains or first officers – have gone through the training program and received permission to carry weapons in the cockpit , said Capt .
Bob Hesselbein , chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association 's National Security Committee .
The union represents more than 61,000 pilots at 43 airlines .
Gee declined to say how many US Airways pilots have graduated from the program and carry guns while on duty , citing security concerns .
But they all carry the same gun , the high - priced and high - quality H&K USP , which Alter said was specially selected for the program .
Gun safety expert Ronald Scott , a ballistics expert who served for 25 years with the Massachusetts State Police , said the gun would n't discharge accidentally if dropped or jarred in some way .
" It 's a top - of - the - line model , " Scott said .
" They 're accurate and highly reliable .
This is not something that you would just walk into a gun store and buy .
And it 's also not something that goes off by itself .
... Someone would have to squeeze the trigger . "
The Airbus 319 will be grounded at Charlotte - Douglas International Airport for several more days as repairs are made .
The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday it wo n't be involved in looking at why the gun went off but will investigate to make sure the plane is safe before it returns to service .

" We want to make sure there was no structural damage and no systems on board were damaged by the bullet , " said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said .
" We want to take a look at the aircraft to make sure it 's in an air - worthy condition . "
Welcome back to the Webcomic Overlook !
After a longer - than - expected hiatus — where I traveled across the country , went to the final Sonics game , injured my foot , and wined and dined like there was no tomorrow — it ’s time I plunge myself into the weird , wonderful world of digital comics .
But first , let ’s talk about anime .
In today ’s Saturday Adult Swim world — where blonde haired ninjas dress up in orange jumpsuits , squiggly - shaped characters do battle at the bidding of their trainers , and guys with spiky hair scream real loud and spend some ninety episodes beating the crap out of each other — it ’s easy to forget that there was a much smaller but very devoted anime fanbase in the 1980’s .
Now , I personally was n’t part of this fanbase .
I cut my teeth a decade later when I watched a little series about where a boy turns into a girl with a splash of cold water .
I also made the mistake telling a girl in college all about it with naive , unbridled enthusiasm .
( Her piercing accusing eyes … they still penetrate my soul . )
There was a time , though , when anime was filled with space - faring adventures , huge plasma rifles , men who piloted transforming robots , ominous spaceships , and women whose hair looked impossibly shellacked .
In short , a time when all anime was pretty much influenced by Star Wars .
Robotech is the most famous of these cartoons .
There were many , many more , though .
Which brings me to the subject of today ’s Webcomic Overlook : Alpha Shade , which looks and feels inspired by those 1980 ’s sci-fi anime .
Alpha Shade is written and illustrated by brothers Chris and Joe Brudlos .
In an interview on Comics Bulletin , the Alpha males , in fact , cite anime as a strong influence .
No surprise there .
As their artwork bears all the touch tones , from the impossibly large doe - like eyes to the youthful proportions to the use of coloring .
They claim that their strongest influence is the anime Wings of Honneamise .
I ’ve only heard of that movie , but I ’ve never seen it .
From my experience , though , Alpha Shade stylistically shares many similarities of Leiji Matsumoto ’s world ( Galaxy Express 999 , Space Battleship Yamato ) of space - faring locomotives and submarine - like spaceships piloted by a cool , one - eyed pirate .
( Incidentally , I totally agree with their assessment that Evangelion was a good series that screwed up at the end … but , really , who does n’t share that exact same sentiment nowadays ? )
Alpha Shade exists — or at least during the first chapter — in a vast , scenic world that seems cobbled together from bits and pieces of human history and from Anne McCaffrey novels .
Humans pilot WWI biplanes and flying airships that look like steamliners from the early 20th century .
An epic war rages .
The mechanized forces engage in balletic dogfights and exchange volleys against other fighters who ride majestic , birdlike creatures that resemble the wyverns from Lord of the Rings and the noble chocobo .
Oh , and apparently our soldiers are taking marching orders from house cats .
Small .
God. Damn .
House cats .
To make it worse , everything is played absolutely straight .
There is no indication that this is the set up for a huge joke .
The story goes on to explain that the cats are really just one form for a creature that is really a large , hulking panther .
There are also attempts to imbue them with mystical powers , which I assume make them more eerie and frightening .
To me sounds like some major heavy lifting to sell this absolutely ridiculous concept .
Nothing the Brundlos brothers do changes the fact that soldiers and assassins are kow - towing to tiny , mewling house cats .
( You know what ’s even more silly ?
That those sweet biplanes are ruined because those goddamn cats painted on them as decals .
Sigh . )
And if that were n’t annoying enough , there are the character designs of our “ battle hardened ” soldiers .
Everybody seems to be either a teenage girl ( and some who look disturbingly younger than that ) or boys who have the build of a teenage girl .
Granted , Alpha Shade is anime - influenced , and the Japanese art form has an awfully high proportion of men with luxuriously long hair , lilting eyelashes , and sensuously pouty lips .
Still , most of these feminine men — from Final Fantasy ‘s Sepiroth to Escaflowne ‘s Allen Schezar to Berzerk ‘s Griffiths — at least have broad shoulders and sturdy builds that are passably male .
( OK , maybe not Griffiths . )
Maybe I ’m a chauvinist , but there ’s something a little disturbing about the barely legal curviness of Alpha Shade ‘s he -hoochies .
That ’s only a few of the detriments with doing an anime style comic .
Here ’s another one : in Alpha Shade , all of the characters look the same .
The story makes an abrupt and confusing transition from Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 .
The first chapter draws the reader in with a brutal , otherworldly war .
The second chapter , on the other hand , goes back in time and retells main character Laura Stone ’s college experiences .
This is set in the real world .
Laura is no longer a soldier and is , instead , the school ’s star gymnast .
( A side note : ever since Jurassic Park II , gymnastics is easily the lamest attribute to ever give a hero . )
Why do the Brundlos ’ brothers make such a staggering narrative shift ?
Hey , your guess is as good as mine .
Anyway , I ’d incorrectly assumed that Laura Stone ’s college friends were members of the squadron we saw earlier .
After re-reading the first chapter and the character summaries ( which , oddly , only have profiles of Laura and her high school pals ) , it turns out I was wrong : Laura was hanging out with a completely new set of characters .
For the love of God , why ?
Keeping track of the first crew was challenge in itself ; now there ’s a whole new set of names and slightly differentiated faces to keep track of ?
Not that the character designs are endearing at all .
See this collection of smug , sneering teenagers ?
These are your heroes , ladies and gentlemen .
Of course , when your protagonists are unpleansant , how are you going to tell them apart from the bad guys ?
By making the bad guys laughably villainous .
I could talk about one character who utterly fails to be a cool badass , or the team of thieves who are supposed to be veterans , yet look like a high school theater club putting on a production of Guys and Dolls .
However , I ’d like to focus attention on a villain who made me guffaw the minute he made his appearance : a large , older gentlemen sitting in the shadows and touching his fingers together in the shape of a peak while glaring ominously .
It ’s as if he were a not - so - subtle bad guy from a Captain Planet cartoon .
He even gets hammy dialogue like “ I tire of your excuses ” and “ When the fool arrives , we ’ll eliminate him . ”
I gotta admit , the minute “ villainous old guy ” showed up on the scene , I laughed ( which , I assume , was not the Brundlos brothers ’ original intent ) .
Ca n’t you see this guy being played , or at least voiced , by John Saxon ?
Son of a gun , I ’m starting to think the Brundlos boys might be doing this on purpose .
I wish I could comment on the story , but it ’s so confusing that I could n’t make head nor tails of it .
Alpha Shade starts simple enough .
Planes dueling giants birds in an epic war .
Cats are apparently field generals .
Gotcha .
But things get out of control , fast .
There ’s some sort of mystical connection from an artifact in Peru .
Thieves trying to steal a gem are gunned down by an outside assailant .
There ’s … some sort of talk about royal houses .
Brundlos & Brundlos introduce what seems like fifty characters , and no one person really standing out from the other .
In fact , outside of Laura Stone , I struggle to remember the names of any of the other characters .
Alpha Shade is a serious chore to follow , and my brain , in protest , refused to absorb any of it .
According to Wikipedia , Alpha Shade has won a total of four Web Cartoonists ’
Choice Awards : Outstanding Long Form Comic , Outstanding Environment Design , and twice for Outstanding Use of Flash .
I can almost guarantee you that these awards were based solely on the scenes featuring the avian creatures .
I ’ll admit , any scene featuring these creatures is utterly stunning .
I especially love their rather simple designs — as if these creatures were a collection of thin blue feathers — and the different angles and perspectives Mssr. Brundlos draws them at .
The illustrations impart a tangible sense of soaring , gliding , diving , and high speed flight .
Joe Brudlos struggles with illustrating humans , though .
He ’s improved his style a lot since the series started five years ago .
Yet Joe still struggles with human poses .
His characters look positively uncomfortable sometimes , especially in scenes where he depicts them reaching out .
Overall , I ca n’t really recommend Alpha Shade .
The series gets an extra star for on the strength of its bird art .
However , the confusing story and the blandness of the characters make the series a less than ideal reading experience .
Rating : 2 stars ( out of 5 )
EDIT : By the way , I was recently reminded of that ridiculous Korean movie , Dragon Wars .
And the it hit me : Alpha Shade is basically Dragon Wars in comic form .
Both are approached with ridiculous wide - eyed optimism and adorned with attractive CGI / illustrations , yet the oppressing crush of so many “ cool , ” incongruous ideas and poor characterizations just sinks the entire project in a sea of headache inducing confusion and blandness .
Maybe this is good news for the Brundlos brothers : Dragon Wars was slammed by critics , yet made a bunch of money in Korea .
Perhaps the Brundloses are just one overseas distribution agreement away from making a bunch of money on Alpha Shade .
Hey , dream the dream , eh ?
“ Well , honey , I guess we can go out to the movies now that we do n’t have to wash the dishes after dinner .
That sure is a load off my mind . ”
“ Yes , but Herb — are you going to actually wash the dirty dishes , for once ?
Or just leave the clean set , in the dishwasher , as if we always array them so nicely ? ”

So after my last post on water , which was a happily received awakening about how much water I used — nearly 200 liters a day ! —
I wanted to see what I could do to decrease water usage with a few level - headed changes in my life .
The point here , again , was just to inform my awareness of the water I use .
The goal here was n’t to push my comfort zone much or conduct a survival study in bare minimum requirements for public health .
No it was just to illustrate that I think it ’s typical human behavior , when we ’re uninformed , to do things that waste materials or can have negative affects on other things around us .
( And I think my colleagues at work can appreciate that I did n’t try a more extreme water restriction experiment ) .
The question of course , is , “ how do I decrease volume used ? ” , when Total volume = Total flow rate ( liters / minute ) * Time used ( minutes ) .
So in order to use less water , you either slow down how fast you pump the water , and / or use it for less time .
Here ’s what I tried :
Shower : turned the flow down , to a measured rate of 4.1 liters / minute ( decrease of 55 % from last post ) .
Kept shower duration constant at 10 minutes .
[ Update : ]
I also tried a “ stop and lather ” shower approach ( thanks for the suggestion , Michael ! ) , where you get wet , then stop the water while lathering .
This cut the duration of water use to ~3 minutes , but alas , unless I need to for drought purposes , during the winter I enjoy a warm shower !
So I went back to 10 minute shower , with a slower flow rate .
Kitchen sink : stopped pre-rinsing all my dishes , after I learned what a waste pre-rinsing is .
Turned the flow down to a measured average of 1.8 liters / minute ( down 64 % from before ) .
Started a “ stop and wash ” policy , for the things I use and wash every day ( eg , blender pitcher ) .
That means , get things wet and soapy , then cut off the water , do the scrubbing , then do a quick rinse .
Often even the rinsing could be done in a few batches of water use , using a swish - and - dump method , rather than having it running continuously .
Bathroom sink – by similar methods , reduced the flow by 55 % and duration of use by approx 50 % .
Toiled , laundry , and dishwasher ???
Ah … I did n’t change anything in these categories .
Much smaller anyway , so not worth focusing on them .
Here ’s the difference , graphically .
I was able to go from 189 liters to 89 liters ( drop of 53 % ! ) .
Overall I thought this experiment was easy , quick , and enlightening in several ways :
Learned how much water I use on a daily and yearly basis
Got familiar with the numbers for individual water use
Comfortably made changes that dramatically reduced water use .
Note I deliberately did n’t do anything that changed my standard of living , and yet saved over 50 % of the water I used !
Wakeup call to me , for those surviving on much less water daily , and how grateful I am , to have access to sanitation and a water supply .
Vitamin supplements taken by millions of people do not increase life expectancy and may raise the risk of a premature death , according to a review of 67 studies with more than 230,000 subjects .
The review , by the Cochrane Collaboration which regularly pools data from trials to evaluate drugs and treatments , found supplements vitamin A , vitamin E and beta - carotene are detrimental to health .
In 47 trials with 180,938 people and a low risk of bias , the " antioxidant supplements significantly increased mortality " , the authors wrote .
When the antioxidants were assessed separately and low risk of bias trials were included and selenium excluded , vitamin A was linked to a 16 % increased risk of dying , beta - carotene to a 7 % increased risk and vitamin E to a 4 % increased risk .
Evidence for vitamin C and selenium was more equivocal , suggesting there was no benefit to taking these pills compared with a placebo .
" The bottom line is current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant supplements in the general healthy population or in patients with certain diseases , " said Goran Bjelakovic , who performed the review at Copenhagen Universityhospital in Denmark .
" There was no indication that vitamin C and selenium may have positive or negative effects .
So regarding these we need more data from randomised trials . "
All the supplements are categorised as antioxidants ; research has suggested these chemicals underlie some of the beneficial effects of eating fruit and vegetables because they soak up harmful byproducts of metabolism which can damage cells and cause aging .
While the evidence of a beneficial effect of a diet rich in fruit and veg is solid , the Cochrane data suggest antioxidant supplements are either useless or detrimental .
Bjelakovic 's team evaluated 67 randomised clinical trials with 232,550 subjects ; 21 of the trials were on healthy subjects , while the rest tested patients with a range of diseases .
The evidence suggests it would be safer to obtain the chemicals not as supplements but by eating plenty of fruit and vegetables .

When he finally does the world a favour and shuffles off to the rest home , Scott Weiland is going to get priority entry into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ’s Flaming Douchebag wing .
In an industry filled with obnoxious asswipes , few are more self - deluded than the man who ’s just announced he ’s had enough of singing for Velvet Revolver .
Just how oblivious to his own worthlessness is Weiland ?
Well , somehow he got it in his head that the world has a boner for the reunion of the pitiful Stone Temple Pilots , who were to grunge what the Knack was to punk rock .
Yes , STP is back together and ready to remind you why the ’90s sucked more than you might remember .
For the moment , though , the headlines are all about Weiland having a queen - sized hissy fit last week while on - stage with VR in Glasgow , Scotland .
In a performance that would have embarrassed Naomi Campbell , the rehab frequent flier told a sold - out crowd that they were witnessing “ something special . ” ¦the last tour by Velvet Revolver ” .
That , of course , was n’t entirely accurate .
What they were really witnessing was various members of Guns N’ Roses saddled with the biggest poseur in rock .
Let ’s face it — no one goes to see Velvet Revolver because they loved Weiland ’s B - grade work with the Stone Temple Toilets .
They go to get an in - the - flesh look at Slash and Duff McKagan , who , just like Keith Richards , prove they do n’t make rock stars like they used to .
In fairness , it ’s not like Weiland has no idea how to keep the unwashed masses entertained .
As spectacles go , they do n’t get much better than his 2007 Burbank , California , run - in with his long - suffering wife .
Mrs. Stone Temple Toilet finished off a protracted domestic dispute by gathering up her husband ’s clothes and starting an impromptu bonfire on the couple ’s front lawn .
This proved the Weilands are , despite their millions , white trash at heart .
That at least gives them something in common with Velvet Revolver ’s fans .
As detestable as Weiland is , you ca n’t blame him for wanting out of VR , a so - called supergroup so lacking in chemistry it makes Audioslave seem like a good idea .
It ’s well documented that the band is divided into two camps .
In one dressing room , you find Slash , McKagan , drummer Matt Sorum , and guitarist Dave Kushner ; in the other , there ’s no one but Weiland , which is understandable : unless you make your living dealing outside the Carnegie Centre , you would n’t want to be around him either .
After throwing down the mike mid-performance in Glasgow and stomping off - stage , Weiland reportedly returned for a petulant performance of “ It ’s So Easy ” .
His next move was a blog attack on Sorum , suggesting that the drummer is too immature to have a real relationship or kids ( the implication being he ’ll never know the joy of roasting marshmallows over burning clothes with them ) .
Continuing on the low road , he then dredged up Sorum ’s latest rehab stint , and added a swipe about how he was a career hired gun until Velvet Revolver .
The latter might be true , but at least he never fronted a faux - grunge band so atrocious that it was publicly mocked by Pavement .
The one good thing that ’s come out of all of this — besides the promise of never having to suffer through another Velvet Revolver record — is that Slash and McKagan look like free agents again .
Hopefully , somewhere in Los Angeles , a bloated Axl Rose is thinking it ’s time to stop dicking around with Chinese Democracy .
After all , he ’s got a score to settle with Weiland , who last year took a shot at him as a “ fat , Botox - faced , wig - wearin ’ fuck ” .
Surely Rose is aware that revenge is a dish best served cold .
What better way to prove that Weiland is a fraud than reuniting with G N’ R and showing him what a real on - stage hissy fit looks like .
May we suggest that the tour kick off in St. Louis , where concert organizers could give Mr. Stone Temple Toilet a video camera and a seat in the front row .
If he asks extra-nicely , he can even bring his bullhorn .

Vote Totals from Memory Cards in Butler County Not Tallied by Central Tabulator , Despite System Reporting Otherwise
Letter to Company from County Officials Also Reveals New Admission Concerning Another Potential Serious Problem for November ...
Brad Friedman Byon 4/8/2008 , 3:00 pm PT
A failure in Diebold touch - screen voting systems in Butler County , OH resulted in votes not being included properly in Election Night results , even though the system had reported that all votes were uploaded and recorded correctly .
Once the error was discovered , a subsequent upload of all of the county 's 1599 touch - screen memory cards to the Diebold central election tabulator after the election , also resulted in the failure to record the results of one of the memory cards , despite the system having reported that all results were " uploaded properly . "
The failure of Diebold 's widely - used AccuVote TSx machines during the state 's March 4th primary election resulted in the initial loss of at least 150 votes , and has prompted a letter of concern to the company ( posted in full at the end of this article ) from Butler County 's Election Director , Betty L. McGary and Deputy Director , Lynn Edward Kinkaid .
In the letter to David Byrd , President of Diebold 's recently - renamed election division , " Premier Election Solutions , " the officials point out that two different memory cards failed to upload vote tallies to the central tabulator .
" It may appear that every vote has been counted when cards indicate they are being properly uploaded , when in fact votes cast on a memory card (s ) are not tabulated in the results , " the officials wrote after having discovered the matter .
" It is unimaginable how serious this situation could have been should the problem be undetected , or ignored , " they concluded .
The letter also details yet another previously - unknown problem with Diebold 's central tabulator --- one that could well - effect this November 's general election --- as revealed to the officials by a company employee during the initial trouble - shooting of the problem .
Despite recent urgings from the Ohio Secretary of State , Diebold AccuVote TSx voting machines are still used as the primary voting system in 44 of Ohio's 88 counties , and are also widely in states across the rest of the country .
The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that officials " do n’t yet know whether the same glitch may have affected results from previous elections in Butler County or elsewhere . " ...
" If we cannot produce accurate and reliable numbers , then it throws the entire process in question , " McGary told the paper , which ads that it 's " It ’s unknown how widespread the problem could be . "
A recount this afternoon , in a close race in the 53rd Ohio House district --- with just 54 votes separating the two candidates --- is said not to have been affected by the problems discovered so far .
Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , who completed a massive study last year of Ohio 's e-voting systems , finding numerous programming errors and " critical security concerns , " has recommended that the state permanently ban the use of all touch - screen systems .
Following the findings of her landmark EVEREST tests , last December she urged counties in the Buckeye State to move from touch - screen voting to paper - based systems .
Almost all of the state 's Election Directors have ignored her recommendations .
Diebold 's voting systems have become legion for their persistent failures during elections , and the ease in which study after study across the country has found that they can be hacked in a moment 's time by insiders who gain access to either a single voting machine or their central tabulation computer .
Vote - flipping viruses can be added via their memory cards , the machines are all opened with a single matching key , and the database which stores vote totals on Microsoft Access easily corrupted to change vote totals without detection .
One other rather notable revelation is also made in the letter sent to Diebold / Premier by Butler 's officials :
[ Diebold / Premier 's Keir ]
Holeman speculated that the problem could stem from the size of a database being larger than 2 gigs .
Mr. Holeman explained that the central count server used for scanning and uploading Absentee and Optical Scan Ballots was taking up too much space in the database and outlined a procedure for backing up , deleting and compressing data before continuing with the uploading of memory cards .
He went on to say that Premier was aware of this problem and that they would be issuing a product advisory .
To date , we have not received such notification .
Mr. Bunch then reviewed the size of our database and found it to be an acceptable size ( 245 mb ) , causing our office to question Mr. Holemans conclusion of too large of a database causing the problem .
So with just a few months left before what is likely to be the largest election in the history of the United States , in addition to the possibility of memory card totals showing as having been uploaded --- when they have n't been --- we learn that there is also a size limit that could effect the proper tabulation of election results on Diebold 's widely used GEMS central tabulator .
Not good .
The two - page letter from Butler County to Diebold / Premier , as originally posted as a two separate graphic files by the Middletown Journal has been retyped and posted below for easier reading ...
April 4 , 2008 Mr. Dave Byrd , President
Premier Election Solutions
3570 Forest Lake Drive
Uniontown , OH 44685 Dear Mr. Byrd ,
We are writing this letter to you by direction of our Board with a copy to Jennifer Brunner , Ohio Secretary of State .
The Butler County Board of Elections has discovered a serious problem in the GEMS program provided by Premier Elections Solutions .
On election night , March 4 , 2008 , during our Unofficial Run , all 1599 memory cards were uploaded properly in out TSX units and tabulated without incident into the GEMS server .
We had received Premiers Product Advisory # PAN2008-003 of February 12 , 2008 , and were in full compliance with the recommended resolutions to the notice regarding GEMS Intermittently Terminating During Results Uploads .
We used twenty Accu Vote - TSXs as recommended , and no more .
All of the cards appeared to have uploaded properly , according to Keir Holeman of Premier Election Systems .
Mr. Holeman was responsible for verifying the number of uploaded cards vs. the number downloaded and was physically present during the entire uploading procedure .
On Thursday , March 6 , while collecting information for the Secretary of State regarding optical scan polling , it was discovered that Memory Card 8 from Lakota Freshman School , was not showing as uploaded , even though nothing seemed out of the ordinary on election night .
We attributed the missing card to human error and made note to be certain to include that card in the Official Run .
Mr. Holeman was immediately notified that a card was overlooked and it appeared that a card had not been uploaded on election night .
Our Official Run took place on April 1 , 2008 .
Again , all 1599 memory cards were uploaded without incident and the number of uploads were verified by two members of our I.T. staff , as well as by Mr. Phil Schmidt from Premier .
The data of Memory Card 8 from Lakota Freshman , previously missing from the Unofficial Run , was now in the report .
On the evening of April 2 , 2008 , we discovered the omission of Memory Card 6 when we printed a report to provide data for a certification document required by the Ohio Secretary of State document .
Once in the database gathering information for the report , we noticed that the votes cast from Memory Card 6 of Adena Elementary were now missing .
The Board of Elections Systems Manager , Jason Bunch , notified Mr. Holeman of this discovery .
Mr. Holeman speculated that the problem could stem from the size of a database being larger than 2 gigs .
Mr. Holeman explained that the central count server used for scanning and uploading Absentee and Optical Scan Ballots was taking up too much space in the database and outlined a procedure for backing up , deleting and compressing data before continuing with the uploading of memory cards .
He went on to say that Premier was aware of this problem and that they would be issuing a product advisory .
To date , we have not received such notification .
Mr. Bunch then reviewed the size of our database and found it to be an acceptable size ( 245 mb ) , causing our office to question Mr. Holemans conclusion of too large of a database causing the problem .
Mr. Bunch and his colleague , Mary Kay Kowalski , our Database Manager , viewed the posting log of our database .
Searching through the file , they located the entry for the missing card , and an error message was found that stated , a sharing violation has occurred .
Simply stated , the card count on election night was 1599 , but when the database was reopened , the count was 1598 .
All of this information was shared with our Board yesterday during the Certification of Election Results Meeting .
The Board reacted strongly to such distressing news , and requested that we write to you immediately demanding immediate attention to this issue .
It is simply unacceptable for errors of this kind to be occurring .
A situation of this nature could impact any election .
It may appear that every vote has been counted when cards indicate they are being properly uploaded , when in fact votes cast on a memory card (s ) are not tabulated in the results .
We wish to commend our excellent staff for detecting this problem and bringing it to the attention of us all .
It is unimaginable how serious this situation could have been should the problem be undetected , or ignored .
Please issue an immediate reply as to how Premier Election Solutions intends on remedying this situation .
Sincerely , Betty L. McGary

The organization responsible for privacy protection in Italy has declared that Logistep has been operating illegally .
The Garante della Privacy says that the anti-piracy company breached the privacy of thousands of P2P users when it tracked and reported them to media companies .
It has 14 days to cease and desist .
Right across Europe , Swiss anti-piracy tracking outfit Logistep has been gathering information about alleged file - sharers and selling it to copyright holders .
They then use the information to make a business out of threatening legal action against file - sharers in order to get cash ‘ compensation ’ .
Currently there are hundreds ( maybe thousands ) of people in the UK being threatened due to the data Logistep gathered for the Two Worlds , Dream Pinball 3D and Colin McRae cases .
Across Europe , Logistep has tracked tens of thousands of P2P users , hammering Germany and Italy in particular .
In January 2008 , on the back of a European Union statement that IP addresses should be regarded as personal data , it was declared that Logistep breached Swiss privacy laws when it spied on P2P users .
It was ordered to stop collecting data about them .
Now , in what could be the beginning of the end for Logistep , the ‘ Garante della Privacy ’ – the Italian organization for data protection and privacy – has declared that Logistep has been acting illegally by spying on P2P users without their permission .
In summary , the decision is based on the following points , all related to privacy breaches :
1 . It is illegal for a private company such as Logistep to monitor the activities of P2P users on the Internet .
2 . The use of P2P software is limited to communication with other P2P clients for the purposes of sharing files .
Such software cannot be used for monitoring P2P users .
3 . It is illegal to monitor users without their permission .
None was requested , nor granted .
In conclusion , the Garante della Privacy has ordered Logistep to delete the data they collected about Italian P2P users by 31st March 2008 , as it was gathered illegally .
This news will come as a huge relief for Italian P2P users as they have been aggressively targeted by Logistep .
Many thousands of users received threatening letters demanding payments for up to 400 Euros , some of them for sharing a single song .
Now that it ’s been decided that Logistep itself was committing the offenses ( in many locales , data protection offenses are criminal in nature ) , it will remain to be seen if people have any chance of getting their payments back , or intend to take legal action themselves against Logistep for a breach of their privacy .
Those affected by this on - going saga in Germany and the UK will take encouragement from this decision .
One guy involved in the UK Dream Pinball 3D case told TorrentFreak : “ There is no way I ’m paying now , 100 % .
Two countries have said that Logistep are breaching privacy laws so i’m going to take my chances .
See you in court boys ! ”
If you ’re a true fan of the Alien series , you ’ll probably want one of these .
I am a fan of science - fiction movies but I ca n’t say I ’m a die - hard fan of Alien .
To tell you the truth , those aliens scare the hell out of me , always have and I ’m pretty sure they always will .
I ca n’t imagine waking up in the middle of the night , for a glass of water , and accidentally bumping into a seven - foot alien , my heart would explode for sure .
But hey , if your strong of heart and love the series , you ’ll want to check the link at the bottom and order one .

President George W. Bush ’s critics are charging that he is attempting to use a “ backdoor signing statement ” to thwart Congress ’ desire to lift the veil of secrecy that has shrouded the U.S. government for the past seven years .
In August 2007 , Congress passed the Open Government Act .
The measure established a new Office of Government Information within the National Archives and Records Administration ( NARA ) , an independent federal agency charged with preserving and documenting government and historical records and increasing public access to those documents .
The new office was to be headed by an ombudsman to oversee disputes over the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) , avoid unnecessary litigation , and monitor the way the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) implements that law .
President Bush signed the measure in December 2007 .
But when he submitted his $ 3.1 trillion budget proposal to Congress , no funds were included for the new program .
Instead , the funding was hidden deep within the budget appendix under the Department of Commerce  on page 239 of the 1,314 - page document  and shifted the new office to Department of Justice ( DOJ ) jurisdiction .
“ Such a move is not only contrary to the express intent of the Congress , but it is also contrary to the very purpose of this legislation  to ensure the timely and fair resolution of Americans ’
FOIA requests , ” said Vermont Democratic Sen.
Patrick Leahy , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and one of the original cosponsors of the Open Government Act .
The reason :
The DOJ is the department charged with defending government agencies accused of inappropriately withholding documents requested under the FOIA .
This gives it a bias in favor of federal agencies , making it both judge and jury .
“ The president is definitely using his budget proposal to try and relocate the FOIA Ombudsman office [ OGIS ] to the DOJ .
It is similar to signing statements in that it is the president ’s attempt to alter implementation of a law as it was laid out by Congress , ” according to Sean Moulton , Director of Federal Information Policy for OMB ( Office of Management and Budget ) Watch , a not - for - profit government watchdog group .
Leahy noted DOJ ’s “ abysmal record on FOIA compliance ” over the past seven years as another reason the agency makes a poor choice for the location of OGIS .
The FOIA was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966 to allow for the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the U.S. government .
In 2001 , Attorney General John Ashcroft issued a memo stating that the DOJ would defend in court any federal agency that withheld information on justifiable grounds .
Previously , the standard was that the presumption was for disclosure .
The new law was aimed at restoring that presumption .
Throughout his administration , Bush has used so - called “ signing statements , ” rather than the budget , to modify acts of Congress he finds objectionable .
Perhaps the best known of these was issued after he signed the so - called McCain Amendment to the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 .
The act was intended to prohibit inhumane treatment of prisoners , including prisoners at Guantanamo Bay ; and required military interrogations to be performed according to the Code of Military Justice .
After signing the law , Bush issued a signing statement saying he would interpret it “ in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the president to supervise the unitary executive branch . ”
Such statements have become a hallmark of the Bush administration .
From the inception of the republic until 2000 , presidents produced fewer than 600 signing statements .
Since 2001 , Bush has objected on constitutional grounds to sections of more than 750 laws .
Critics of the Bush administration say they are not surprised at the president ’s use of the budget to thwart the will of Congress .
They see the tactic as part of a pattern of restricting access to information .
They cite the growth of public requests for information under the FOIA over the last six years .
The total number of FOIA requests received in 2006 was 21,412,736 , substantially more than in 2005 .
Backlogs in processing requests remain significant , according to an audit conducted in January 2007 by the National Security Archive ( NSA ) , an independent non-governmental research institute and library located at George Washington University which collects and publishes declassified documents obtained through FOIA .
One FOIA request has now been pending for more than 20 years , according to the NSA .
The statutory response time is 20 business days .
The Bush administration has refused to release information on a wide range of subjects , including the secret meetings of Vice President Dick Cheney ’s energy policy task force .
It has ordered federal Web sites to remove information that the administration believed could be sensitive .
It issued a controversial memo limiting access to records under the Presidential Records Act in November 2001 , which allowed former presidents and vice presidents to prevent access to records .
It also refused to disclose the names of those arrested after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Many of those denied access to information have sued the government .
Among the most widely publicized was the suit brought by a group of advocacy organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , the Center for Constitutional Rights ( CCR ) , and others , to force the Department of Defense ( DOD ) to turn over documents relating to the harsh interrogation methods used against detainees in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The suit yielded hundreds of thousands of documents , including reports by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) confirming such treatment .
Advocates of transparent governance express varying levels of confidence in the proposed new ombudsman ’s importance .
Steven Aftergood , head of the Government Secrecy Project for the Federation of American Scientists , told IPS he does n’t have “ high expectations of the ombudsman ’s office , regardless of where it is located . ”
He asked , “ Is an official from the National Archives really going to intervene on my behalf when the CIA stubbornly refuses to process one of my requests ?
Would it make a difference if he or she did ?
I tend to doubt it . ”
OMB Watch ’s Moulton takes a different view .
He told IPS , “ I firmly believe Congress got it right when they assigned the job to the National Archives , which has better objectivity on FOIA disputes and greater experience in managing the disclosure of documents .
Justice ’s traditional position of defending agencies against FOIA lawsuits , means a bias to side with agencies in disputes likely exists . ”
“ The office ’s direct clout with agencies will derive from the level of support the administration provides .
This will be tied directly to how high a priority the next administration places on disclosure and transparency , ” he added .
But , both agree , “ it is important that the law be implemented as written .
Any effort by the administration to deviate from the terms of a statute should be opposed , no matter how trivial it might be , because the law is the law . ”
Both also point out that the president ’s budget action “ is not a done deal . ”
“ Congress can appropriate funds for the ombudsman to be expended solely at the Archives , and can prohibit their use by Justice , ” Aftergood says .
Moulton agrees .
“ Congress can , and in many ways always does , deviate from the president ’s proposed budget .
The question is whether Congress will allocate money to the National Archives for the office even though the president did n’t request it , ” he told IPS .
Understanding IP Addresses – What is an IP Address ?
By Olusola Kolebaje
NETWORKING BASICS
A network can be defined as the interconnection of autonomous computers linked together to facilitate communication while networking is the simple concept of connected computers .
Networks and networking have grown exponentially over the last 15 years ; they have evolved at light speed just to keep up with huge increases in basic critical user needs such as sharing data and printers ,
as well as more advanced demands such as video conferencing .
TYPES OF NETWORKS
LOCAL AREA NETWORK ( LAN )
A LAN ( Local Area Network ) is a group of computers and network devices connected together , usually within the same building .
A Local Area Network ( LAN ) is a high - speed communication system designed to link computers and
other data processing devices together within a small geographical area , such as a workgroup , department , or building .
Local Area Networks implement shared access technology .
This means that all the devices attached to the
LAN share a single communications medium , usually a coaxial , twisted pair or fibre optic cable .
METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK ( MAN )
Metropolitan area networks or MANs are large computer networks usually spanning a city or a town .
They typically use wireless infrastructure or optical fibre connections to link their sites .
The IEEE 802-2001 standard describes a MAN as being : “ A MAN is optimized for a larger geographical area than is a LAN , ranging fr-om several blocks of buildings to entire cities .
MANs can also depend on communications channels of moderate to high data rates .
A MAN might be owned and operated by a single organization , but it usually will be used by many individuals and organizations .
MANs might also be owned and operated as public utilities .
They will often provide means for internetworking of local networks .
Metropolitan area networks can span up to 50km . ”
WIDE AREA NETWORK ( WAN )
Wide Area Network ( WAN ) is a computer network that covers a broad area .
A WAN in compares to a MAN , is not restricted to a geographical location , although it might be restricted to a geographical locations , it might also be confined within the bounds of a state or country .
A WAN connects several LANs , and may be limited to an enterprise ( a corporation or organization ) or accessible to the public .
The technology is high speed and relatively expensive .
The INTERNET is an example of a worldwide public WAN .
NETWORKING DEVICES
ROUTERS
Routers are used to connect networks together and route packets of data fr-om one network to another .
Routers , by default break up a broadcast domain , which is the set of all devices on a network segment that hear all broadcasts sent on that segment .
Routers also break up collision domains .
This is an Ethernet term used to describe a network scenario where one particular device sends a packet on a network segment , forcing every other device on that segment to pay attention to it .
At the same time , a different device tries to transmit , leading to a collision , after which both devices must retransmit one at a time .
Routers run on the layer 3 of the OSI ( Open System Interconnection ) reference model .
SWITCHES
Switches are used for network segmentation based on the MAC addresses .
Switches look at the incoming frame ’s hardware addresses before deciding to either forward the frame or drop it .
Switches break up collision domains but the hosts on the switch are still members of one big broadcast domain .
HUB
A hub is really a multiple port repeater .
A repeater receives a digital signal and re-amplifies or regenerates that signal , and then forwards the digital signal out all active ports without looking at any data .
An active hub does the same thing .
This means all devices plugged into a hub are in the same collision domain as well as in the same broadcast domain , which means that devices share the same bandwidth .
Hubs operate at the physical layer of the OSI model .
IP ADDRESSING
An IP address is a numeric identifier assigned to each machine on an IP network .
It designates the specific location of a device on the network .
An IP address is a software address and designed to allow host on one network to communicate with a host on a different network regardless of the type of LANs the hosts are participating in .
IP TERMINOLOGIES
Bit : A bit is one digit , either a 1 or a 0 .
Byte : A byte is 7 or 8 bits , depending on whether parity is used .
Octet :
An octet , made up of 8 bits is just an ordinary 8 bit binary number .
In most cases byte and octet are completely interchangeable .
Network address :
This is the designation used in routing to send packets to a remote network .
For example 10.0.0.0 , 172.16.0.0 , and 192.168.10.0 are network addresses .
Broadcast address :
The address used by applications and hosts to send information to all nodes on a network is called the broadcast address .
Examples include 255.255.255.255 which is all networks , all nodes ; 172.16.255.255 , which is all subnets and hosts on network 172.16.0.0 .
HEIRARCHICAL IP ADDRESSING SCHEME
An IP address consists of 32 bits of information ( IPV4 ) .
IPV6 , a new version of IP consists of 128 bits of information .
The 32 bits IP is divided into four sections referred to as octet or bytes each containing 1 byte ( 8 bits ) .
An IP address is depicted using any of these 3 methods .
Dotted decimal , as in 172.16.30.56
Binary , as in 10101100.00010000.00011110.00111000
Hexadecimal , as in AC.10.1E.38
All this examples represent the same IP address .
But the most commonly used is the dotted decimal .
The Windows Registry stores a machine ’s IP address in hex .
The 32 bit IP address is a structured or hierarchical address , as opposed to a flat non hierarchical address .
Although either type of addressing scheme could have been used , hierarchical addressing was chosen for a good reason .
The advantage of this scheme is that it can handle a large number of addresses , namely 4.3 billion ( a 32 bit address space with two possible values for each position that is either 1 or 0 gives 237 , or 4,294,967,296 ) .
The disadvantage of the flat addressing scheme relates to routing .
If every address were unique , all routers on the internet would need to store the address of each and every machine on the internet .
This would make efficient routing impossible .
NETWORK ADDRESS RANGE
The network address uniquely identifies each network .
Every machine on the same network shares that network address as part of its IP address .
In the IP address of 172.16.30.56 , 172.16 is the network address .
The node address is assigned to and uniquely identifies each machine on a network .
This number can also be referred to as host address .
In 172.16.30.56 , 30.56 is the node address .
Class
A network is used when a small number of networks possessing a very large number of nodes are needed .
Class C network is used when numerous networks with a small number of node is needed .
CLASS A ADDRESSES
The first bit of the first byte in a class A network address must always be off or 0 .
This means a class A address must be between 0 and 127 , inclusive .
0xxxxxxx .
hhhhhhhh .
hhhhhhhh .
hhhhhhhh
If we turn the other 7 bits all off and then turn them all on , we ’ll find the class A range of network addresses .
00000000 = 0
01111111 = 127
Class A format is network.node.node.node , so for example in the IP address 49.22.102.70 , the 49 is the network address and 22.102.70 is the node address .
Every machine on this particular network would have the distinctive network address of 49 .
CLASS B ADDRESSES
The first bit of the first byte must always be turned on , but the second bit must always be turned off .
01xxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.hhhhhhhh.hhhhhhhh
If we can turn the first bit on and the second bit off and if the other 6 bits all off and then all on , we ’ll find the class B range of network addresses .
10000000 = 128
10111111 = 191
Class B format is network.network.node.node , so far in the IP address 132.163.40.57 , the 132.163 is the network address and 40.57 is the node address .
CLASS C ADDRESSES
The first and second bit of the first byte must always be turned on , but the third bit can never be on .
110xxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.hhhhhhhh
If we turn the first and second bit on and the third bit off and then all other 5 bits all off and all on , we ’ll find the class C range of network address .
11000000 = 192
11011111 = 223
Class C format is network.network.network.node , for example in the IP address 195.166.231.75 , the 195.166.231 is the network address and 75 is the node address .
CLASS D AND CLASS E ADDRESSES
The address between 224 and 255 are reserved for class D and E networks .
Class D ( 224-239 ) is used for multicast addresses and class E ( 240 - 255 ) for scientific purposes .
PRIVATE IP ADDRESSES
Private IP addresses are those that can be used on a private network , but they ’re not routable through the internet .
This is designed for the purpose of creating a measure of well - needed security , but it also conveniently saves valuable IP address space .
If every host on every network had to have real routable IP addresses , we would have run out of IP addresses to hand out years ago .
Class A 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255
Class B 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.255.255
Class C 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255
TROUBLESHOOTING IP ADDRESSING
Here are the troubleshooting steps in resolving a problem on an IP network .
1. Open a DOS window and ping 127.0.0.1 .
This is the diagnostic or loopback address , and if you get a successful ping , your IP stack is considered to be initialized .
If it fails , then you have an IP stack failure and need to reinstall TCP / IP on the host .
2. Fr-om the DOS window , ping the IP addresses of the local host .
If that ’s successful , then your Network Interface Card ( NIC ) card is functioning .
If it fails , then there is a problem with the NIC card .
This does n’t mean that a cable is plugged into the NIC , only that the IP protocol stack on the host can communicate to the NIC .
3 . Fr-om the DOS window , ping the default gateway .
If the ping works , it means that the NIC is plugged into the network and can communicate on the local network .
If it fails , then you have a local physical network problem that could be happening anywhere fr-om the NIC to the gateway .
4 . If steps 1 through 3 were successful , try to ping the remote server .
If that works then you have IP communication between then local host and the remote server , you also know that the remote physical network is working .
5 . If the user still ca n’t communicate with the server after steps 1 through 4 were successful , then there ’s probably a resolution problem and there is need to check the Domain Name Server ( DNS ) settings .
NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION
Network Address Translation ( NAT ) is used mainly to translate private inside addresses on a network to a global outside address .
The main idea is to conserve internet global address space , but it also increases network security by hiding internal IP addresses fr-om external networks .
TABLE 3 : NAT ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
ADVANTAGES
Conserves legally registered addresses .
Reduces address overlap occurrence .
Increases flexibility when connecting to internet .
Eliminates address renumbering as network changes .
Translation introduces switching path delays
DISADVANTAGES
Loss of end - to - end traceability
Certain applications will not function with NAT enabled .
TYPES OF NAT
Static NAT :
This type of NAT is designed to allow one - to - one mapping between local and global addresses .
Static NAT requires that there is one real internet IP address for every host on your network .
Dynamic NAT :
This version gives one the ability to map an unregistered IP address to a registered IP address fr-om out of a pool of registered IP addresses .
Overloading :
This is also known as Port Address Translation ( PAT ) .
It is the most popular type of NAT configuration .
Overloading is a form of dynamic NAT that maps multiple unregistered IP address to a single registered IP address by using different ports .
With overloading thousands of users can connect to the internet using only one real global IP address .
NAT TERMINOLOGIES
Local addresses : Name of local hosts before translation .
Global addresses : Name of addresses after translation .
Inside local : Name of inside source address before translation .
Outside local : Name of destination host before translation .
Inside global : Name of inside hosts after translation
Outside global : Name of outside destination host after translation .
LAYER2 SWITCHING
Layer2 switching is the process of using the hardware address of devices on a LAN to segment a network .
The term layer2 switching is used because switches operate on the data - link layer which is the second layer of the OSI reference model .
Layer2 switching is considered hardware - based bridging because it uses specialized hardware called an application - specific integrated circuit ( ASIC ) .
ASICs can run up to gigabit speeds with very low latency rates .
Switches read each frame as it passes through the network , the layer2 device then puts the source hardware address in a filter table and keeps track of which port the frame was received on .
The information ( logged in the switch ’s filter table ) is what helps the machine determine the location of a specific sending device .
After a filter table is built on the layer2 device , it will only forward frames to the segment where the destination hardware is located .
If the destination device is on the same segment as the frame , the layer2 device will block the frame fr-om going to any other segments .
If the destination is on a different segment , the frame can only be transmitted to that segment .
This is called TRANSPARENT BRIDGING .
When a switch interface receives a frame with a destination hardware address that is n’t found in the device filter table , it will forward the frame to all connected segments .
If the unknown device that was sent the frame replies to this forwarding action , the switch up - dates its filter table regarding that device ’s location .
ADVANTAGES OF LAYER2 SWITCHING
The biggest benefit of LAN switching over hub - centred implementations is that each device on every segment plugged into a switch can transmit silmatenously whereas hubs only allow one device per network segment to communicate at a time .
Switches are faster than routers because they do n’t take time looking at the Network layer header information .
Instead , they look at the frame ’s hardware address before deciding to either forward the frame or drop it .
Switches create private dedicated collision domains and provide independent bandwidth on each port unlike hubs .
The figure below shows five hosts connected to a switch , all running 10 M bps half - duplex to the server .
Unlike the hub , each host has 10 M bps dedicated communication to the server .
LIMITATIONS OF LAYER2 SWITCHING
Switched networks break up collision domains but the network is still one large broadcast domain .
This does not only limits your network ’s size and growth potential , but can also reduce its overall performance .
FUNCTIONS OF LAYER2 SWITCHING
There are three distinct functions of layer2 switching , these are
Address learning .
Forward / filter decision
Loop avoidance .
ADDRESS LEARNING
When a switch is first powered on , the MAC forward / filter table is empty .
When a device transmits and an interface receives the frame , the switch places the frame source address in the MAC forward / filter table , allowing it to remember which interface the sending device is located on .
The switch then has no choice but to flood the network with this frame out of every port except the source port because it has no idea where the destination device is actually located .
If a device answers the flooded frame and sends a frame back , then the switch will take source address fr-om that frame and place that MAC address in its database as well , associating this address with the interface that received the frame .
Since the switch now has both of the relevant MAC addresses in its filtering table , the two devices can now make a point to point connection .
The switch does n’t need to flood the frame as it did the first time .
If there is no communication to a particular address within a certain amount of time , the switch will flush the entry fr-om the database to keep it as current as possible .
FORWARD / FILTER DECISIONS
When a frame arrives at a switch interface , the destination hardware address is compared to the forward / filter MAC database .
If the destination hardware address is known and listed in the database , the frame is sent out only the correct exit interface .
The switch does n’t transmit the frame out any interface except for the destination interface .
This preserves bandwidth on the other network segments and is called FRAME FILTERING .
LOOP AVOIDANCE
When two switches are connected together , redundant links between the switches are a good idea because they help prevent complete network failures in the event one link stops working .
Redundant links are extremely helpful but they often cause more problems than they solve , this is because frames can be flooded down all redundant links silmatenously creating network loops .
Switches use a protocol called STP ( Spanning Tree Protocol ) created by Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) now Compaq to avoid network loops by shutting down redundant links .
With STP running , frames will be forwarded only on the premium STP - picked link .
CONFIGURING THE CISCO 2950 CATALYST SWITCH FAMILY .
The 2950 switch is one of the Cisco Catalyst switch family ’s high - end model .
The 2950 comes in many flavours and run 10 M bps all the way up to 1 G bps switched ports with either twisted - pair or fibre .
They can provide basic data , video and voice services .
2950 SWITCH STARTUP
When the 2950 switch is first powered on , it runs through a Power - on - Self - test ( POST ) .
At first all port LEDs are green , and if upon completion the post determines that all ports are in good shape , all the LEDs blink and then turn off .
But if the POST finds a port that has failed both the system ’s LED and the port ’s LEDs turn amber .
However , unlike a router , the switch is actually usable in Fresh - out - of - the - box condition .
You can just plug the switch into your network and connect network segment together without any configuration .
To connect to the Cisco switch , use a rolled Ethernet cable to connect a host to a switch console serial communication port .
Once you have the correct cable connected fr-om your PC to the Cisco switch , you can start HyperTerminal to create a console connection and configure the device as follows :
1. Open HyperTerminal by clicking on start button and then All programs , then Accessories , then Communication , then click on HyperTerminal .
Enter a name for the connection .
It is irrelevant what you name it .
Then click OK .
2. Choose the communication port either COM1 or COM2 , whichever is open on your PC .
3 . Now at the port settings .
The default values ( 2400 bps and no flow control hardware ) will not work , you must set the port settings as shown in the figure below .
Notice that the bit rate is set to 9600 and the flow control is set to none .
At this point click OK and press the Enter key , and you should be connected to your Cisco switch console port .
Here ’s the 2950 switch ’s initial output :
— System Configuration Dialog —
Would you like to enter the initial configuration dialog ?
[ Yes / no ] : no
Press RETURN to get started !
00:04:53 : %LINK -5-CHANGED : Interface Vlan1 , changed state to administratively down
00:04:54 : %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN : Line protocol on Interface Vlan1 , changed state to down
Switch >
THE CONFIGURATION
The switch > prompt is called the user exec mode and it ’s mostly used to view statistics .
You can only view and change configuration of a Cisco switch in privileged exec mode which you get into with the enable command .
Switch >
Switch > enable
Switch #
Switch # disable
Switch >
The global configuration mode can be entered fr-om the privileged mode by using the configure terminal command or config t for short .
Switch # config t
Enter the configuration commands , one per line , End with CNTL /Z .
Switch ( config ) # hostname zenith
Zenith ( config ) #
The hostname command is used in naming the switch .
The hostname of a switch is only locally significant but it ’s still helpful to set a hostname on a switch so that you can identify the switch when connecting to it .
SETTING THE ENABLE MODE PASSWORDS AND LINE PASSWORD .
Zenith > enable
Zenith # config t
Enter the configuration commands , one per line , End with CNTL /Z .
Zenith ( config ) # enable password bank
Zenith ( config ) # enable secret middle
The enable password bank command sets the enable password as bank and the enable secret middle command sets the enable secret password as middle .
The enable secret password is more secure and it supersedes the enable password if it is set .
The enable secret password and the enable password cannot be the same on the 2950 switch .
Zenith ( config ) # line ?
First line number
console Primary terminal line
vty Virtual terminal
Zenith ( config ) # line vty ?
First line number
Zenith ( config ) # line vty 0 15
Zenith ( config - line ) # login
Zenith ( config - line ) # password alex
Zenith ( config - line ) # line con 0
Zenith ( config - line ) # login
Zenith ( config - line ) # password malouda
Zenith ( config - line ) # exit
Zenith ( config ) # exit
Zenith #
The line vty 0 15 , login and password alex commands set the telnet password to alex and the line con 0 , login , and password malouda commands sets the console password to malouda .
SETTING IP INFORMATION
You do n’t have to set any IP configuration on the switch to make it work .
You can just plug it in .
But there are two reasons we set IP address information on the switch .
To manage the switch via Telnet or other management software .
To configure the switch with different VLANs and other network functions .
Zenith ( config ) # int vlan 1
Zenith ( config - if ) # ip address 172.16.10.17 255.255.255.0
Zenith ( config - if ) # no shutdown
Zenith ( config - if ) # exit
Zenith ( config ) # ip default - gateway 172.16.10.1
Zenith ( config ) #
The IP address is set to 172.16.10.17 and the no shutdown command must be applied to enable the interface .
CONFIGURING INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS
You can administratively set a name for each interface on the switches with the description command .
Zenith ( config ) # int fastethernet 0 / ?
FastEthernet Interface number .
Zenith ( config ) # int fastethernet 0/
1
Zenith ( config - if ) # description Sales LAN
Zenith ( config - if ) # int f0/12
Zenith ( config - if ) # description Connection to Mail server
Zenith ( config - if ) # CNTL /
Z
Zenith #
You can look at the descriptions at any time with either the show interface command or the show running - config command fr-om the global configuration mode .
ERASING AND SAVING THE SWITCH CONFIGURATION
Zenith # copy running - config startup - config
Zenith # erase startup - config
The first command copies the configuration into the NVRAM ( Non-volatile RAM ) while the erase startup - config command erases the switch configuration .
Zenith # erase startup - config
Erasing the nvram filesystem will remove all files !
Continue ? [ confirm ] [ Enter ]
[ OK ]
Erase of nvram : complete
Zenith #
VIRTUAL LAN ( VLAN )
A Virtual LAN ( VLAN ) is a logical grouping of network users and resources connected to administratively defined ports on a switch .
When one create VLANs , one creates smaller broadcast domains within a switched internetwork by assigning different ports on the switch to different subnetworks .
A VLAN is treated like its own subnet or broadcast domain , which means that frames broadcast onto the network are only switched between ports logically grouped within the same VLAN .
By default , no hosts in a specific VLAN can communicate with any other hosts that are members of another VLAN .
5.1 ADVANTAGES OF VLAN
A group of users needing security can be put into a VLAN so that no user outside the VLAN can communicate with them .
As a logical grouping of users by function , VLANs can be considered independent fr-om their physical or geographical locations .
VLANs can enhance network security .
It can block broadcast storms caused by a faulty NIC ( Network Interface Card ) card .
VLANs increase the number of broadcast domains while decreasing their sizes .
VLAN MEMBERSHIP
VLANs are usually created by the administrator , who then assigns switch ports to each VLAN .
Such a VLAN is called a static VLAN .
If the administrator wants to do a little more work up front and assign all the host devices hardware addresses into a database , then the switch can be configured to assign VLANs dynamically whenever a host is plugged into a switch .
This is called dynamic VLAN .
STATIC VLANs
Static VLANs are the usual way of creating VLANs , and they ’re also the most secure .
The switch port that you assign a VLAN association to always maintain that association until an administrator manually changes that port assignment .
DYNAMIC VLANs
A dynamic VLAN determines a node ’s VLAN assignment automatically .
Using intelligent management software , you can base assignment on hardware addresses , protocols , or even applications to create dynamic VLANs .
An example is the VLAN Management Policy Server ( VMPS ) service used to set up a database of MAC addresses that can be used for dynamic addressing of VLANs .
A VMPS database maps MAC addresses to VLANs .
FRAME TAGGING
As frames are switched through the network , switches must be able to keep track of all the frames .
Frames are handled differently according to the type of link they are traversing .
The frame identification method uniquely assigns user defined ID to each frame .
This is sometimes referred to as the “ VLAN ID ” .
Each switch that the frame reaches must first identify the VLAN ID fr-om the frame tag , and then it finds out what to do with the frame by looking at the information in the filter table .
If the frame reaches a switch that has another trunked link , the frame will be forwarded out the trunk - link port .
Once the frame reaches an exit to an access link matching the frame ’s VLAN ID , the switch removes the VLAN identifier .
This is so the destination device can receive the frame without having to understand their VLAN identification .
There are two different types of links in a switched environment , they are :
Access links :
This type of link is only part of one VLAN .
Any device attached to an access link is unaware of a VLAN membership ; the device just assumes its part of a broadcast domain .
Access link devices cannot communicate with devices outside their VLAN unless the packet is routed .
Trunk links :
Trunk links can carry multiple VLANs .
A trunk link is a 100 or 1000 Mbps point to point link between two switches , between a switch and server .
These carry the traffic of multiple VLANs fr-om 1 to 1005 at a time .
Trunking allows you to make a single port part of multiple VLANS at the same time .
It also allows VLANs to span across multiple switches .
VLAN IDENTIFICATION METHODS
There are basically two ways of frame tagging .
Inter - Switch Link ( ISL )
IEEE 802.1Q
The main purpose of ISL and 802.1Q frame tagging methods is to provide interswitch VLAN communication .
Inter - switch Link ( ISL ) Protocol :
This is proprietary to Cisco switches , and it is used for fast Ethernet and gigabit Ethernet links only .
ISL routing can be used on a switch port , router interfaces and server interface cards to trunk a server .
IEEE 802.1Q : Created by the IEEE as a standard method of frame tagging , it is n’t Cisco proprietary so if you ’re trunking between a Cisco switched link and a different brand of switch ; you have to use 802.1Q for the trunk link to work .
VLAN TRUNKING PROTOCOL ( VTP )
This protocol was created by Cisco but it is not proprietary .
The basic goals of VLAN Trunking protocol ( VTP ) are to manage all configured VLANs across a switched internetwork and to maintain consistency through the network .
VTP allows an administrator to add , delete and rename VLANs on a switch , information that is then propagated to all other switches in the VTP domain .
Before one can get VTP to manage VLANs across the network , one has to create a VTP server .
All switches sharing the same VLAN information must be in the same VTP domain .
One can use a VTP domain if there is more than one switch connected in a network , but if all the switches are in only one VLAN , there is no need to use VTP .
VTP information is set between switches via trunk port .
This report exposes one to various aspects of computer networking , IP routing and IP switching and how to manage a network fr-om an office network to larger networks .
Areas covered in this report includes IP addressing , Network Address Translation ( NAT ) , IP switching and Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) .

JACKSONVILLE , Florida ( CNN ) -- Eduardo Gonzalez , a petty officer second class with the U.S. Navy , is about to be deployed overseas for a third time .
Making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back .
Mildred and Eduardo Gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported .
His wife faces deportation to Guatemala -- her home country that she has n't seen since 1989 .
He also does n't know what would happen to his young son , Eduardo Jr. , if that happens .
" I like being in uniform and serving my country , but if she goes back I 'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job , " he said .
" Defending the country that 's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind . "
Gonzalez , who works on helicopters that bring cargo , supplies and military personnel in and out of Iraq , testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel last month , detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his , where military members ' families could be deported while they 're defending their country overseas .
Watch " they 're tearing families apart " »
" I want to serve my country 100 percent .
But with this issue in the back of my mind , I feel I can't do that , " he testified on September 6 .
The U.S. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases .
Each is handled case - by - case , not by the military , but by immigration authorities .
The government does n't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar to Gonzalez's .
Immigration officials also said marrying a U.S. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to U.S. citizenship or permanent legal status .
Lt. Col. Margaret Stock , a member of the U.S. Army Reserves who teaches immigration law at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , New York , said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members .
" You got to understand .
When you 're in a combat zone , you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy .
You can't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you 're never going to see them again , " she said .
Stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases .
On the one hand , the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance , housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas .
On the other hand , the same government is trying to deport the very same people .
" What 's happening right now is , because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws , we 've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home , " she said .
In Gonzalez 's case , his wife , Mildred , came to the United States with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old .
They were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from Guatemala .
In September 2000 , Mildred 's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application .
Her mother was granted legal status in July 2004 , according to Gonzalez .
However , six weeks earlier , Gonzalez and Mildred got married , canceling Mildred 's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21 .
As a result , her legal status still remains in jeopardy .
A judge in June granted her a one - year extension to remain in the United States .
If her legal status does not change by June 8 , 2008 , she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation .
That 's just fine , according to Mark Krikorian , the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration .
" What you 're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces , and that 's just outrageous , " he said .
" What we 're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military .
...
There 's no justification for that kind of policy . "
Gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified .
" I 'm trying to make his country better -- my country better -- and it should be her country too . "
Gonzalez himself entered the country legally , crossing the Mexican border with his family when he was about 10 .
He joined the Navy as a so - called " green - card sailor " and became a U.S. citizen in July 2005 .
The military does accept some immigrants who are n't U.S. citizens .
" I understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained , but on the other token , there are times when the situation is just out of their reach , " Gonzalez said .
His wife , Mildred , added , " We did n't come here to break the law .
We just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else . "
U.S. Army Sgt. Emmanuel Woko , a member of the Army 's 2nd Brigade , 1st Infantry Division who faces his third tour in Iraq , understands just how Gonzalez and his family feel .
His wife and children could be sent back to Nigeria .
" My heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to Nigeria while I am deployed in Iraq , " he said .
" I am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought . "
That 's a sentiment echoed by Gonzalez : " We are not asking for anything .
We are just asking for our families to stay with us . "

Various types of clowns can still be found all over Mexico , from the elegant carablancas ( “ white faces ” ) with elaborate sequined costumes ; to the Great Depression - inspired trampas , or vagabundos .
wearing tattered rags and frowns .
There are also the payasos callejeros — the street clowns .
The callejeros wear homespun costumes and mime and dance at busy traffic lights or tell jokes on crowded buses .
Many paint black teardrops on their faces to represent their marginalized existence .
They perform for adult audiences , indulging in bawdy humor and bad language .
For some , being a street clown is a passion .
For others , it ’s a result of poverty , unemployment and desperation ..
The callejeros are urban heroes and cultural warriors .
Many perceive the street clowns as artistic revolutionaries who bring heart and sweat and spirit to every performance , who fight daily for sustenance and the space to express their art .

14th April 2008
Most commentators we now read are taking the potential I.M.F. gold sales as a foregone conclusion .
With the unknown quantity of the U.S. Congress [ who are fully aware of just how good an investment gold has been and will likely be ] , who blocked the sales last time it was proposed , the sale is by no means a foregone conclusion .
But of far greater importance is the question of how these sales could affect the gold price .
The answer is exceptionally positive , after we consider the views of the I.M.F. itself on just how the sales will be orchestrated .
Only one obstacle remains
The focus on whether the sales will take place has been on the U.S. Congress who , if they approve will give the nod to 16.83 % of the votes of the I.M.F .
With the Executive of the I.M.F. having approved the sale already , once the Congress has said yes , the deal is struck .
Let �s move onto the likelihood that the sales will be finally approved , what then ?
Just how will the sales move forward in the light of the intriguing statements coming from the I.M.F. executives ?
What are these statements ?
The key statements have recently come from IMF Finance Department Director Michael Kuhn who said : q
The gold sales will take some time .
First , the Executive Board has just endorsed the proposal to amend the Articles of Agreement to expand the IMF 's investment authority .
This amendment needs to be approved by the Board of Governors , and then make its way through national legislatures .
It looks as though a year is the shortest time for entry into force of an amendment of our Articles .
q
The gold sales will be phased to avoid the risk of disrupting markets .
So we wo n't see the full effect immediately , but we estimate that 3 or 4 years from now , we should be back in the black .
q
As for the modalities of the gold sales , we will either sell to a central bank that is willing to buy gold , or sell in conjunction with the already established official gold sales program �the Central Bank Gold Agreement .
q
We will coordinate with other official holders of gold to sell in such a way that we do not increase the overall amount of official gold sales into the market .
q
Naturally , the sales will be conducted within a strong framework for governance and controls , and with a high level of transparency .
We are the world 's third largest holder of gold , and we are keenly aware of our responsibility not to disrupt the gold market .
Which Central Banks could be interested ?
Russia ?
The implications of these statements are riveting !
We know , for instance that Russia has the intention of increasing gold reserves to 10 % of its reserves , so for them to buy would barely dent this number .
A direct deal between the I.M.F and them would be at a market related price and not be seen by the market at all .
The only impact such a deal would have would be the reaction by the market to the subsequent announcement of the sale .
China
We know that China too has a ridiculously low level of gold reserves and is highly suspicious of going into the open market because once there were even suspicions that that was happening , gold prices would rocket .
[ This has limited them to buying their own local production or none at all ] .
But with 400 tonnes on offer at one price [ and no gold price impact ] , perhaps they would jump at the opportunity ?
Other U.S. $ surplus nations ? �
There are several other Asian nations who might well be interested in buying a large tonnage of gold at a price that is in line with market prices , at one go .
With the U.S. $ in such a decline and with no change in sight , what better way to protect the naton�s saving than to change a chunk of these into gold .
�
The oil producers of the world , from the Middle East to Venezuela might also find the offer extreemely tempting too ?
The very sight of such a large amount of gold on offer handled in such a way as to not disruot the gold market changes the propsect of buying gold fundamentally .
So we do believe , that should the I.M.F. choose that route , when they are ready to sell , they will do so quickly and painlessly and at market .
The market reaction to a Central Bank buying gold would be positive in the extreme !
It would confirm gold�s value as a reserve asset in difficult days .
Institutional Investors as well as individuals of high worth would follow such a lead .
This would attract a far greater volume as well number of gold investors to the market and change the tempo of gold investing considerably .
.. not increase the overall amount of official gold sales �
Many believe that the I.M.F. is referring to the �ceiling� of 500 tonnes a year , but that is a limitation , not the expected �overall official gold sales into the market� .
It would take more clarification from the I.M.F. for us to accept that they were referring to the �ceiling� .
So , just what does this mean , we ask again ?
If the signatories have announced a total gold sales level of 1730 tonnes at the beginning of the Central Gold Bank Agreement and have only say 400 tonnes [ which may well be close to the amount remaining at the end of September this year [ the end of the fourth of five years of the agreement ] , then that is the extent of the planned �official gold sales into the market� , so their sales would have to replace this amount .
However , this reasoning may be at fault , if there is still a year to go before these sales can take place ?
It would require a new Central Bank Gold Agreement for the I.M.F. to work �in conjunction with the already established sales program� to begin in September of 2009 for this to happen .
No such word is out there as far as we know ?
This leaves us still in the dark as to precisely what is to happen once these sales are finalized .
This week saw NO GOLD SALES from the E.C.B .
They did revalue their holdings at the end of the quarter and reported this this week , but sold no gold .
It is the first time in the entire histories of both the " Washington Agreement " and the " Central Bank Gold Agreement " that we have seen no sales in a particular week !
It is difficult to draw any solid conclusions from this but we remain riveted to the weekly E.C.B. reports from now on , and perhaps link the IMF activities to this ?
Conclusions to be drawn on the effect on the gold prices : � The I.M.F. gold sales can only be positive for the gold price ?

EASTPOINTE , Michigan ( Reuters ) - Among the byproducts of the U.S. housing crisis is a surge in scams that cheat people out of their money , their homes , or both , under the guise of offering to rescue them from foreclosure .
“ There is a lot of money to be made if you are good at committing fraud , ” said Debra Zimmerman , an attorney at Los Angeles - based Bet Tzedek Legal Services , which provides free legal assistance to stricken home owners .
“ Foreclosure rescue scams are big business right now . ”
Groups like Zimmerman ’s say that as soon as borrowers end up in foreclosure -- a matter of public record in the United States - they are bombarded with calls , leaflets and knocks on the door from people armed with fraudulent offers of help .
Huston Julian , 54 , of Eastpointe , Michigan , nearly fell for such a scam .
Julian bought a home in this working class suburb of Detroit in October 2006 , but fell behind with his $ 1,084 monthly payment when his disability benefits were cut off .
He ended up in foreclosure in December .
“ I got calls all day from people saying they could save my home , ” said Julian , 54 , seated at a small table in his kitchen .
One group promised help if he gave them $ 3,800 .
He borrowed money from family and was all ready to pay , until his suspicions were aroused by the frequency of their calls .
“ I said to myself ‘ something just ai n’t right here , ” Julian remembered .
On the advice of his younger sister , he got in touch with local non-profit counseling agency the Michigan Neighborhood Partnership ( MNP ) .
“ I was able to convince Huston not to send the money and explained to him this was a rescue scam , ” said Juanita Bryant , a loss mitigation specialist at MNP who is negotiating with Julian ’s lender on a mortgage repayment schedule based on his restored disability benefits .
While such scams are on the rise , law enforcement agencies are overwhelmed .
“ Almost every foreclosure rescue program you see out there is fraud , ” said Todd Lackner , a San Diego - based mortgage fraud investigator .
“ Sadly , the law enforcement community lacks the funds to investigate or prosecute all the cases . ”
Nonprofit groups say they , too , are vastly outgunned .
Huston Julian speaks to Reuters in his kitchen in Eastpointe , Michigan , March 18 , 2008 .
When Huston Julian ended up in foreclosure a group approached him seeking $ 3,800 to save his home , but was warned at the last minute that this was a foreclosure rescue scam .
Such scams have proliferated as the housing crisis has spread and counseling groups worry that U.S. law enforcement agencies lack resources to stem the tide .

“ The challenge we face is we lack the resources to compete with groups going door - to - door targeting home owners , ” said Josh Zinner , co-director of New York - based nonprofit NEDAP .
SMOOTH OPERATORS
As well as extorting money with promises of help that never materialize , other rescue scams include tricking borrowers into signing over part or all of their property .
Often , the owners think they are signing a refinancing when they are actually signing a deed of transfer .
“ In many cases people sign blank documents that are then doctored by adding text and a notary stamp to make them look like genuine contracts , ” said Pegah Kamrava of Bet Tzedek .
Kamrava is representing Teresa Martinez , 60 , who said she was tricked out of her home by four men when she fell behind on her mortgage .
“ They seemed like such decent young men so I trusted them , ” she said .
“ Now I feel stupid because they stole my home . ”
Martinez said she did not knowingly sign a transfer document , and paid $ 2,000 a month to the men , thinking she was still making her mortgage payments .
Randy Cornejo , listed as the owner of the home in court papers , said he bought the home from Martinez a year ago and rented it back to her .
“ I am the owner , and because she stopped paying rent we want to evict her , ” he told Reuters by telephone .
Bet Tzedek ’s Zimmerman said rescue scams prey on borrowers ’ fear and desperation when they end up in foreclosure .
“ Property ownership is an integral part of the American dream , ” she said .
“ When home owners face losing that dream and someone says they can help , they jump at the chance . ”
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) has a list of certified counseling groups on its Web site ( www.hud.gov) and experts say homeowners should accept help only from certified groups .
“ If a group is not HUD certified , home owners should avoid it , ” said Ozell Brooklin of Acorn Housing in Atlanta .
“ The cash people hand over to crooks is money that could help them get a loan modification from their lender and save their home . ”
Rescue scam statistics are scarce .
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation includes rescue scams in overall fraud data .
This year , the FBI says it expects 60,000 Suspicious Activity Reports related to mortgage fraud , up from 47,000 in 2007 and just 7,000 in 2003 .
The agency periodically announces it has filed charges in high - profile rescue fraud cases involving millions of dollars and hundreds of homes .
“ We ’ve had reports of rescue scams from almost every field office , ” said FBI spokesman Stephen Kodak .
“ This shows the ingenuity of criminals who can adapt to any economic environment . ”
The FBI has 150 agents devoted to mortgage fraud and has formed task forces with local law enforcement agencies in 32 U.S. states to help track rescue scams , he said .
But some officials argue more funding and public support are needed .
“ Law enforcement agencies were already overworked and overwhelmed before this problem arose , ” said David Fleck , deputy district attorney for Los Angeles county .
“ The public at large sees violent crime as a greater threat than white collar crime , so rescue scams receive less attention . ”
“ But fraud is just theft , ” Fleck said , “ only instead of a gun you use a lie . ”

In February a Danish court forced ISP Tele2 to block its subscribers from accessing The Pirate Bay , following a similar order late last year to block allofm p3.com .
A new proposal before the Danish government would mean that such actions would be quick and easy to do , without the need for a single court hearing .
Back in February we reported on the IFPI forcing , via the Danish courts , an ISP to block its subscribers from accessing The Pirate Bay .
This case was the third occasion where an industry lobby group had flexed its muscles to block a website , a similar measure was used to block allofmp3.com and mp3sparks.com .
However , the legality of these actions under European law , specifically the Infosoc directive , is dubious at best .
Nevertheless , two of the largest opposition parties in Danish parliament think it is a good idea , despite the ineffectiveness of the block , to streamline the process , making it quicker and easier to do .
A proposal ( Danish ) before the government seems to create a tribunal to handle these cases .
Whereas in the past cases have involved a rights holder suing an ISP and forcing a block through the courts , this proposal creates a tribunal to do it instead .
This tribunal will apparently consist of members appointed by government ministers , who will then rule on blocks with no judicial oversight .
Any sites blocked would have to go through the courts to appeal and the site would remain blocked unless and until successful .
If that was not bad enough , there is also talk of a secretariat that would handle ‘ simple ’ cases , so the appointed tribunal would not even have to hear the majority of cases .
Cases would be put to the tribunal by copyright holders that feel they have had their rights infringed by the target site .
As with the court cases , though , it ’s extremely unlikely that the accused site will be invited or even made aware of any such proceedings , and allowed to state their case .
“ This is a wet dream for organizations like IFPI , ” is the view of Ole Husgaard , chairman of the Danish Pirate Party .
“ This is n’t even a law proposal , so there is not all the work usually done in our parliament when passing laws ; this can be passed in a month or two .
If it is , I would guess that we will have at least 2000 sites on the blocking list within 12 months – without a single court case having been decided , if any get started at all . ”
He ’s not alone in his pessimism .
“ It ’s blatant censorship of course . ” is the opinion of The Pirate Bay ’s brokep .
“ It ’s not in the interest of the citizens , so I hope the government understands that if they go against the people like that , they should be replaced .
It is also not a huge step before they start censoring other stuff – let ’s say political parties that have thoughts about changing the current government . ”
As analysis of the Pirate Bay block has found it contrary to EU laws , it ’s curious as to the motivation behind this proposal .
The only rational one would be bribery , either legal or not , and so the question we are forced to ask is , are Danish politicians cheaper to buy than those in New York ?
1 ) Your unit is patrolling in a heavily populated Iraqi city .
As you move toward a mosque , a crowd of about 300 people approaches , blocking the road .
They come within 100 meters , shouting insults and anti-coalition statements in Arabic and broken English .
What do the ROE allow you to do ?
A . Be alert , maintain a defensive posture and detain anyone purposefully interfering with your mission .
B. Engage in deadly force if you can understand their insults .
C. Run away .
D. Engage with deadly force .
By blocking the road , they are interfering with your mission , so you can use deadly force .
2 ) Same crowd as in Situation 1 , only now some of the people have sticks , hammers , clubs , and glass soda bottles that appear to have kerosene in them , but you see no firearms .
Now what ?
A. Shoot the Iraqis carrying the Evian bottles because carrying kerosene shows hostile intent .
B. Shoot the Iraqis carrying Evian bottles because [ Evian ] is manufactured in France .
C. Throw CS [ gas ] grenades .
D. Use the minimum force necessary , but understand that you may use deadly force immediately against any individual in the crowd who demonstrates hostile intent or commit a hostile act .
3 ) Same crowd as in Situation 1 , except that now you see that the crowd has surrounded a single civilian .

He 's a Ba'ath Party member .
D. Run away .
4 ) Your squad has been assigned the mission of patrolling a 10 - block section of downtown Iraqiville .
As your column of HMMWVs [ High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle or Humvee ] turns down a narrow street , a crowd forms and begins to press in around you .
Your squad leader exits his vehicle in an attempt to calm the crowd and clear a path for the column .
Suddenly , an Iraqi male in civilian attire approaches your squad leader from a side alley , pulls out a pistol and shoots him in the neck .
Just as quickly , the perpetrator runs into the crowd and can no longer be seen .
What do you do ?
A . If you regain PID [ Positive Identification ] of the shooter , you may kill or capture him because he CONTINUES to remain a threat .
B. Spray the crowd with automatic fire in the hopes of killing the shooter .
C. Arrest as many of the Iraqis as possible because they witnessed the shooting and did nothing to stop it .
D. Kill or capture the shooter in order to revenge the death of your squad leader .
5 ) You are part of a patrol in the outskirts of a large Iraqi town .

What do you do ?
A. Immediately bomb the mosque .
B. Wait until evening prayers , then bomb the mosque .
C. You may pursue the attackers into the mosque using deadly force , if necessary .
D. Nothing .

C. Remain vigilant , prepare to engage the source of the hostile fire , whether it's the Iraqi police or others .
7 ) You are on patrol crossing a road when two vehicles speed past your unit 's position toward a coalition checkpoint .
The vehicles stop short of the checkpoint , quickly make U - turns and begin speeding back towards your unit 's position .
When they turned , you noticed reflective tape on the doors of each vehicle .
You can also see 2 - 3 individuals in each vehicle , and some of them have AK - 47s pointed outboard .
What is your response ?
A. Stop the vehicle so you can search it and ascertain the occupants ' intent .
B. Stay alert , but do n't immediately engage the vehicle or personnel inside unless they commit a hostile act or show hostile intent .
C. Immediately engage the vehicle with deadly force because they are racing toward you and might have hostile intent .
D. Do nothing .
The reflective tape indicates that the vehicle is an Iraqi police vehicle , so they pose no threat .
8 ) While in a convoy , you notice an individual crouched behind a tree next to the road you are traveling .
In front of the individual and closer to the road , you see something like a trash bag , animal carcass or other object .

A. Nothing .
He 's running away and no longer poses a threat so we can't engage him .
B . You may engage with deadly force .
C. You can engage , but you have to escalate the force you use in self - defense by first shouting a warning , then shooting a warning shot , then engaging ONLY if the lesser forms of force do n't work .
D. Nothing , unless you can tell that the weapon is functional .
10 ) Same object in the road as in the previous scenario , only now there are children on the opposite side of the road watching your convoy , pointing at you , and talking to someone you cannot see .
It is possible they are acting as " spotters . "
Can you use force against the children ?
A. No .
No amount of force is authorized in this situation because you 're not sure what the children were doing .
B . You should stop the children and question them .
If they are aiding the enemy , you may detain them .
C. Engage them with deadly force .
It 's possible that they were helping the enemy target Americans .
D. Do not engage .
Deadly force is NEVER authorized against children .
11 ) You are in a three - vehicle convoy moving toward your FOB [ Forward Operating Base ] .
It 's dark but the road is clear and there are no other vehicles in the area .
Suddenly , a sedan rapidly approaches the convoy from the rear , pulling up to a few feet from the rear vehicle in the convoy .
You train your .50 cal[iber ] on the car , 50 feet away , and notice that the passenger in the vehicle appears to be reaching for something on the floor of his vehicle .
What do you do ?
A. Immediately engage the vehicle and the occupants with the .50 cal .
B. Immediately engage the vehicle with the .50 cal , but not the people because using a .50 cal on people is a violation of the law of war .
C. Stay ready , prepare to fire if you observe hostile intent or hostile act .
D. Do nothing and do n't aim your .50 cal at the vehicle because it might upset them and cause them to dislike Americans .
We need to do everything possible to win their hearts and minds .
12 ) You are in a five - vehicle convoy moving out of Iraqiville , mid-afternoon , at 60 mph .
As you pass under an overpass you observe an adult male , with a grenade - sized object in his hand , looking over the pedestrian railing above your lane .
You can not tell what 's in the man 's hand .
What do you do ?
A. Kill the adult man on the bridge .
No innocent man would be looking over the railing .
B. Kill the adult man on the bridge .
The object is either a grenade or a can of beer .
Either way , he 's committing a crime so you can engage with deadly force .
C. Stay ready , observe the man on the bridge and prepare to fire if you observe hostile intent or hostile act .
13 ) You are in the lead armored HMMWV escorting a four - vehicle convoy along HWY 1 .
There is a flash behind you followed by a loud explosion as one of the NTVs [ Non-Tactical Vehicle ] in the convoy disappears in a cloud of dust and smoke .
You see two males 200 meters away from you mount a motorcycle and speed away .
You also see an orange sedan back out of a driveway 150 meters south of your position and speed away .
Three males in a roadside stand 100 meters up the road run into a nearby house , but you start taking small - arms fire from a different house 150 meters west of your position .
What do you do ?
A . You should respond with deadly force to the hostile fire coming from the house , remaining vigilant to the other possible threats in the area .
B . You should engage the fleeing men on the motorcycle first because they 'll be beyond effective range if you wait .
C. Engage everywhere you see movement because there 's no telling who detonated the IED [ Improvised Explosive Device ] .
14 ) The convoy you are in suffers an IED attack on the unpopulated outskirts of Baghdad .
As you focus your attention on the location of the IED , you notice two individuals in civilian clothes and no weapons jump up out of [ a ] fighting hole about 40 meters away from where the IED exploded and run away from you .
You quickly ascertain the individuals were within command - detonation range of the IED .
What can you do ?
A. Nothing because you do n't have enough information to know for certain that the fleeing men detonated the IED .
B . You can engage with deadly force , ONLY after you fire a warning shot first .
C. You may engage the individuals with the necessary force , including deadly force , to prevent their escape .
D. Detain , but do not kill the fleeing men .
Running away is just like surrender and prevents us from killing him .
15 ) You are manning a nighttime OP [ Observation Post ] .
Through your NVGs [ Night Vision Goggles ] , you spot two Iraqi men stealing TVs and other electronics from a mom & pop store .
What can you do ?
A. Nothing because you can NEVER shoot looters .
B . Do not use deadly force , because you can't shoot looters of NON - essential equipment .
You may detain , arrest and turn the looters over to the Iraqi police if time and situation permit .
C. Nothing , the electronics store probably belonged to a Ba'ath Party member .
D. Nothing because we can't get involved in " Iraqi crimes . "
We 're only worried about combatants .
16 ) You are manning a nighttime OP .
Through your NVGs , you spot an Iraqi stealing AK - 47s from an Iraqi armory 500 meters away .
What do you do ?
A. Nothing .
Using deadly force to stop a person stealing a few AK - 47s is disproportionate use of force and therefore a war crime .
B. Sight alignment , trigger control .
You should engage with deadly force .
C. You should call the Iraqi police and let them detain the thieves .
D. Nothing .
Weapons are n't considered mission - essential , unless they are U.S. weapons .
17 ) Your six - vehicle convoy has halted on the outskirts of Iraqiville due to a vehicle breakdown .
The convoy commander has assessed that the area is secure enough to stop to attempt repairs .
He has also briefed certain equipment as being mission essential , including NVGs .
A crowd of locals gathers around your vehicles .
In spite of your warnings , some teenagers move closer to your vehicle .
Before you can react , the group scatters .
One of the fleeing locals has what appears to be your NVGs .
What do you do ?
A . You should engage using graduated force , up to and including deadly force , to detain the youth , but can immediately engage using deadly force if required .
A. Nothing , NVGs should n't be declared mission - essential equipment .
A. Ignore the convoy commander and let the youth take the NVGs , it is one less thing you have to be responsible for .
18 ) Would it make any difference if items were being looted from a U.S. Army vehicle that had been disabled by an IED ?
A. Yes .
B. No .
19 ) During a nighttime Cordon and Knock on the residence of an influential Sunni businessman suspected of funding anti-coalition activities , you notice two individuals fleeing the scene on rooftops .
Without further details , what do you do ?
A. Engage with deadly force .
Fleeing is an indicator of hostile intent .
Why would they run if they were innocent ?
B. Engage with CS grenade .
I know we can't use deadly force but the CS wo n't kill them .
Perfect solution .
C. You should not engage the individuals .
You may detain the fleeing individuals in order to gain intelligence .
Clinton has repeatedly called for the panel to seat the delegations at this summer ’s Democratic National Convention .
Clinton launches new Fla. , Mich .
offensives
BOCA RATON , Fla . –
With a bit of momentum from her landslide Kentucky victory and less lopsided Oregon loss , Hillary Clinton is turning her attention to two states that have already voted , Florida and Michigan , over two states and a territory that have yet to , South Dakota , Montana and Puerto Rico .
It ’s part of a last - gasp strategy aimed at prolonging her campaign by convincing the party to alter the nomination math .
By seating the penalized Florida and Michigan delegations , she would not only gain a significant number of delegates but also bolster her popular vote argument with the superdelegates .
Advertisement
The new Florida and Michigan offensive will kick off in earnest today with three campaign events in South Florida – though she ’ll have to share the state with Obama , who begins a three - day campaign swing there – and will likely also include campaigning in Michigan .
That ’s in addition to an already circulating online petition and escalating campaign rhetoric casting Clinton as best - positioned to carry the two important big states in the fall against presumptive Republican nominee John McCain – partly because of her fight against disenfranchising Democrats there .
In an intentional bit of symbolism , Clinton ’s three campaign stops will be in Palm Beach , Broward , and Dade counties – the three jurisdictions where Democrats allege voters were disenfranchised during the 2000 presidential election .
Clinton campaign officials acknowledge the target audience for the offensive is not only voters but the superdelegates who will ultimately decide the nomination as voters and the party officials who will meet May 31 to effectively rule on the fate of the Florida and Michigan delegations .
“ What ’s driving this effort is primarily the belief that every voice and every vote should count , something that Sen.
Clinton believes very strongly , ” said campaign spokesman Mo Elleithee .
“ And we hope that everyone shares that same value , including superdelegates , DNC members and all Democrats . ”
He said more than 360,000 people had added their names to an online petition supporting the seating of the states ’ delegates .
And he said the campaign has been asking supporters to take that message to members of the Democratic National Committee and its Rules and Bylaws Committee .
The previously little - known committee will meet before the next primary in Puerto Rico June 1 to decide whether , or how , to allocate delegate votes from the two states .
The DNC stripped the states of their delegate votes for holding their primaries earlier than the party wanted .
Clinton , who won both states ’ primaries ( Obama was n’t on the ballot in Michigan ) , has repeatedly called for the panel to seat the delegations at this summer ’s Democratic National Convention , an outcome that would cut into Obama ’s lead in pledged delegates .
David McDonald , an uncommitted Washington state superdelegate who sits on the rules committee , said he would n’t be swayed by “ mere publicity and a claim to be able to win the states . ”
Still , Obama does n’t appear inclined to let Clinton have the Florida and Michigan stages to herself .
He also arrived today in Florida and will be spending three days campaigning here , seeking to win over voters who sided with Clinton by a margin of 50 percent to 33 percent in the unsanctioned Jan. 29 primary .
Last week , he paid his first visit this year to Michigan , touring a Chrysler plant , holding a town hall in Macomb County and a rally in Grand Rapids .
It ’s unlikely that the rules committee will back a solution that significantly boosts Clinton ’s pledged delegate tally .
But she has portrayed her effort to seat the delegations as a fight to protect voters ’ franchise in the two states .
“ I ’m going on now to campaign in Montana , South Dakota and Puerto Rico – and I ’m going to be standing up for the voters of Florida and Michigan , ” she told supporters during her Kentucky victory speech Tuesday .
“ Democrats in those two states cast 2.3 million votes and they deserve to have those votes counted .
That ’s why I ’m going to keep making our case until we have a nominee whoever she may be . ”
Expect to hear more Florida and Michigan talk in the coming days , said Clinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe , who said the campaign will “ probably ” travel to Michigan soon .
“ The reason you probably hear more frequency is we have a lot fewer contests coming up , ” he said Tuesday night .
“ They ’re two of the five remaining events that are going to be very important to determine who the nominee of the Democratic Party is .
So before , you heard a lot of talk about Pennsylvania and Indiana and North Carolina .
Now , we have obviously Puerto Rico , South Dakota , Montana – and to resolve these two important states . ”
Thunderous applause filled the Louisville hotel ballroom where Clinton held her Kentucky victory party when she delivered the Florida - and - Michigan line , but McAuliffe admitted superdelegates are the main audience for the appeal .
The goal seems to be implanting the idea that Clinton would fare better than Obama against McCain in Florida and Michigan in November partly because of her support for seating the two delegations .
It ’s a theory that has become increasingly prominent in the campaign ’s message over the last few days .
McAuliffe asserted Tuesday “ it makes it a lot easier for our Electoral College map if Florida and Michigan are excited about the upcoming elections and do n’t feel they were disenfranchised in the nominating process .
So our argument ’s always been – and all the different maps and the recent polling data show it – Hillary Clinton beats John McCain … in Ohio .
She beats him in Florida .
She wins Pennsylvania .
She wins states we ’ve got to win . ”
A late April poll by Quinnipiac University found Clinton leading McCain 49 percent to 41 percent among Florida voters , while Obama and McCain were tied .
And Bill Clinton Tuesday morning told reporters that not seating the states ’ delegations “ violates our values and is dumb politics . ”
It would alienate those states ’ voters in the general election , he asserted , adding “ we ’re going to decapitate them , smush them , step on them , act like they never existed , act like they never voted . ”

South African troops serve as peacekeepers in several countries
A trade union representing South Africa 's soldiers is taking the defence ministry to court , accusing it of discriminating against people with HIV .
The South African Security Forces Union ( Sasfu ) says people with the Aids virus are not recruited , or if they become soldiers , are refused promotion .
The defence minister has been quoted as saying that people with HIV could not " withstand difficult missions " .
An estimated 11 % of the population and 35 % of the army is HIV - positive .
Sasfu deputy president Charles Jacobs said there was a policy of mandatory testing .
" Being HIV - negative is a pre-requisite to gain employment in SANDF [ South African National Defence Force ] , " he said .
He also said that any HIV - positive soldiers were denied the chance to be deployed abroad and argued these policies were unconstitutional .
South Africa has peacekeepers in several countries but some , like Sudan , insist that potential peacekeepers take an Aids test before being deployed there .
The Aids Law Project , which is representing Sasfu , says employers have long tried to argue that people with HIV could not do strenuous jobs but said this was a " lame excuse " .
Despite the hard line attributed to the defence minister , Deputy - President Phumzile Mlambo - Ngcuka last year gave a different message :
" HIV - positive individuals in the military should be given every opportunity to do the tasks for which they have been trained and which they are still fit to perform , " she said .
[ Update 11.9.2008 :
Over the last several days , thousands of environmental activists in Germany have blocked and delayed a train carrying nuclear waste from France into the country to be stored in an old salt mine .
The story reminded me that there is still substantial opposition to nuclear power , despite the fact that it has been touted by many as an essential component of our energy mix because nuclear power generates little in the way of greenhouse gas emissions .
The story also reminded me of the following post . ]
This past spring we conducted a reader poll that concluded with some rather unexpected results .
Nearly 75 percent of the respondents believe that nuclear power is good because it is a source of “ abundant carbon free energy . ”
Granted , this simple reader ’s poll with an admittedly minute n of 133 is not a statistical representation of the public attitude of any particular group of people .
But attitudes towards nuclear power have undergone a palpable shift amongst self - identified environmentalists in recent years .
The change is especially striking considering that the anti-nuclear cause had been one of the core issues for the environmental movement for almost four decades .
But as consumed as I am with energy issues and the politics that surround them , I remain somewhat agnostic about nuclear power .
Why is that ?
There ’s no simple answer .
Part of it is not wanting to reconcile the tensions between nuclear power as a low - carbon alternative with the ecological dangers of mining uranium and the big issue of transporting and storing nuclear waste .
I would also argue that the reason I ( and many other greens my age ) are not particularly averse to nuclear power is because the pressing environmental issues that were building blocks to my own environmentalism were generally not related to nukes .
I vaguely remember the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island .
And I was in high school when the more serious accident at Chernobyl happened .
But that ’s it .
There has not been a new nuclear power plant built in this country in 30 years , and for that reason nukes have faded away as one of the critical rallying issues of the modern environmental movement .
One of my biggest concerns is the issue of water .
Extracting uranium from the ground using in situ mining methods requires massive amounts of water , as do the reactors themselves .
Judith Lewis , who also holds that concern .
She wrote in Mother Jones ,
“ Light water ” reactors , used at the majority of the world ’s nuclear plants , use water both to moderate the chain reaction and produce steam to spin turbines — 2 billion gallons per day on average .
Most of it returns to the adjoining river , lake , or ocean up to 25 degrees warmer , an ecological impact that could significantly interfere with nuclear power ’s chances as a climate - change solution .
Already , wherever a light - water reactor sits near a sensitive body of water , its intake pipes kill fish and its outflow distorts ecosystems to favor warm - water species . ”
That said , I recognize that nuclear power must be part of “ the discussion . ”
I just want to be sure that the discussion happens , and that it is thorough , and geographically specific .
In other words , nuclear power will not be the answer everywhere .
Last year I wrote an article about how Swedish society is disintegrating and is in danger of collapsing , at least in certain areas and regions .
The country that gave us Bergman , ABBA and Volvo could become known as the Bosnia of northern Europe .
The “ Swedish model ” would no longer refer to a stable and peaceful state with an advanced economy , but to a Eurabian horror story of utopian multiculturalism , socialist mismanagement and runaway immigration .
Some thought I was exaggerating , and that talk of the possibility of a future civil war in Sweden was pure paranoia .
Was it ?
In a new sociological survey ( pdf in Swedish , with brief English introduction ) entitled “ Vi krigar mot svenskarna ” ( “ We ’re waging a war against the Swedes ” ) , young immigrants in the troubled city of Malmö have been interviewed about why they are involved in crime .
Although it is not stated , most of the immigrant perpetrators are Muslims .
In one of the rare instances where the Swedish media actually revealed the truth , the newspaper Aftonbladet reported several years ago that 9 out of 10 of the most criminal ethnic groups in Sweden came from Muslim countries .
This must be borne in mind whilst reading the following newspaper article :
Immigrants are “ waging war ” against Swedes through robbery
The wave of robberies the city of Malmö has witnessed during this past year is part of a “ war against the Swedes . ”
This is the explanation given by young robbers from immigrant backgrounds when questioned about why they only rob native Swedes , in interviews with Petra Åkesson for her thesis in sociology .
“ I read a report about young robbers in Stockholm and Malmö and wanted to know why they rob other youths .
It usually does not involve a lot of money , ” she says .
She interviewed boys between 15 and 17 years old , both individually and in groups .
Almost 90 % of all robberies reported to the police were committed by gangs , not individuals .
“ When we are in the city and robbing we are waging a war , waging a war against the Swedes . ”
This argument was repeated several times .
“ Power for me means that the Swedes shall look at me , lie down on the ground and kiss my feet . ”
The boys explain , laughingly , that “ there is a thrilling sensation in your body when you ’re robbing , you feel satisfied and happy , it feels as if you ’ve succeeded , it simply feels good . ”
“ It ’s so easy to rob Swedes , so easy . ”
“ We rob every single day , as often as we want to , whenever we want to . ”
The immigrant youth regard the Swedes as stupid and cowardly : “ The Swedes do n’t do anything , they just give us the stuff .
They ’re so wimpy . ”
The young robbers do not plan their crimes : “ No , we just see some Swedes that look rich or have nice mobile phones and then we rob them . ”
Why do they hate the Swedes so much ?
“ Well , they hate us , ” Petra Åkesson reports them as answering .
“ When a Swede goes shopping , the lady behind the counter gives him the money back into his hand , looks into his eyes and laughs .
When we go shopping , she puts the money on the counter and looks the other way . ”
Åkesson , who is adopted from Sri Lanka and hence does not look like a native Swede , says it was not difficult to get the boys to talk about their crimes .
Rather they were bragging about who had committed the most robberies .
Malin Åkerström , a professor in sociology , sees only one solution to the problem : “ Jobs for everybody .
If this entails a deregulation of the labor market to create more jobs , then we should do so . ”
It is interesting to note that these Muslim immigrants state quite openly that they are involved in a “ war , ” and see participation in crime and harassment of the native population as such .
This is completely in line with what I have posited before .
The number of rape charges in Sweden has quadrupled in just above twenty years .
Rape cases involving children under the age of 15 are six times as common today as they were a generation ago .
Most other kinds of violent crime have rapidly increased , too .
Instability is spreading to most urban and suburban areas .
Resident aliens from Algeria , Libya , Morocco and Tunisia dominate the group of rape suspects .
Lawyer Ann Christine Hjelm found that 85 per cent of the convicted rapists were born on foreign soil or from foreign parents .
The phenomenon is not restricted to Sweden .
The number of rapes committed by Muslim immigrants in Western nations is so extremely high that it is difficult to view these rapes as merely random acts of individuals .
It resembles warfare .
This is happening in most Western European countries , as well as in other non muslim countries such as India .
European jails are filling up with Muslims imprisoned for robberies and all kinds of violent crimes , and Muslims bomb European civilians .
One can see the mainstream media are struggling to make sense of all of this .
That is because they cannot , or do not want to , see the obvious : this is exactly how an invading army would behave : rape , pillage and bombing .
If many of the Muslim immigrants see themselves as conquerors in a war , it all makes perfect sense .
Malmö in Sweden , set to become the first Scandinavian city with a Muslim majority within a decade or two , has nine times as many reported robberies per capita as Copenhagen , Denmark .
Yet the number one priority for the political class in Sweden during this year ’s national election campaign seems to be demonizing neighboring Denmark for “ xenophobia ” and a “ brutal ” debate about Muslim immigration .
During last years Jihad riots in France , Sweden ’s Social Democratic Prime Minister Göran Persson criticised the way the French government handled the unrest in the country .
“ It feels like a very hard and confrontational approach . ”
Persson also rejected the idea of more local police as a “ first step ” in Sweden .
“ I do n’t believe that ’s the way we would choose in Sweden .
To start sending out signals about strengthening the police is to break with the political line we have chosen to follow , ” he said .
Meanwhile , as their authorities have largely abandoned their third largest city to creeping anarchy , there is open talk among the native Swedes still remaining in Malmö of forming vigilante groups armed with baseball bats out of concern for their children ’s safety .
As I argued in another essay : If Arnold Schwarzenegger fails to get re-elected as Governor of California he may like to do a sequel to “ Conan the Barbarian . ”
He could shoot it in Malmö .
He will get the extras for free .
What happened to the famous Swedish nanny state , you say ?
Do n’t Swedes pay the highest tax rates in the world ?
Yes , they do .
But tens of billions of kroner , some say several hundred billions , are being spent every year on propping up rapidly growing communities of Muslim immigrants .
Sweden has become the entire world ’s welfare office , because the political elites have decided that massive Muslim immigration is “ good for the economy . ”
Soon Sweden ’s “ army ” may comprise no more than 5,000 men , five thousand troops to defend a nation more than three times the area of England .
Moreover , it may take up to a year to assemble all of them , provided they are not on peacekeeping missions abroad .
That Sweden might soon need a little peacekeeping at home seems to escape the establishment .
In 2006 the celebrated Swedish welfare state has become the world ’s largest pyramid scheme , an Enron with a national flag .
Although Sweden is an extreme example , similar stories could be told about much of Western Europe .
As Mark Steyn points out , the Jihad in the streets of France looked like the early skirmishes of an impending Eurabian civil war , brought on by massive Muslim immigration and Multicultural stupidity .
Law and order is slowly breaking down in major and even minor cities across the European continent , and the streets are ruled by aggressive gangs of Muslim youngsters .
At the same time , Europeans are paying some of the highest taxes in the world .
We should remind our authorities that the most important task of the state – some would even claim it should be the only task of the state – is to uphold the rule of law in exchange for taxation .
Since it is becoming pretty obvious that this is no longer the case in Eurabia , we should question whether these taxes are still legitimate , or whether they are simply disguised Jizya paid in the form of welfare to Muslims and our new Eurocrat aristocracy .
Although not exactly the Boston Tea Party , perhaps the time has now come for a pan-European tax rebellion :
We will no longer pay taxes until our authorities restore law and order and close the borders to Muslim immigration .
This is urgent .
When enough people feel that the system is no longer working and that the social contract has been breached , the entire fabric of democratic society could unravel .
What happens when the welfare state system breaks down , and there is no longer enough money to “ grease ” the increasing tensions between immigrants and native Europeans ?
And what happens when people discover that their own leaders , through the EU networks and the Euro - Arab Dialogue described by Bat Ye’or in her book “ Eurabia , ” have been encouraging all these Muslims to settle here in the first place ?
There will be massive unemployment , and tens of millions of people will feel angry , scared and humiliated , betrayed by the system , by society and by their own democratic leaders .
This is a situation in some ways similar to the Great Depression that led to the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s .
Is this where we are heading once again , with fear , rising Fascism and political assassinations ?
The difference is that the “ Jewish threat ” in the 1930s was entirely fictional , whereas the “ Islamic threat ” now is very real .
However , it is precisely the trauma caused by the events of 70 years ago that is clouding our judgement this time , since any talk at all about the threat posed by Muslim immigration or about preserving our own culture is being dismissed as “ the same rhetoric as the Nazis used against the Jews . ”
Europeans have been taught to be so scared of our own shadows that we are incapable of seeing that darkness can come from the outside , too .
Maybe Europe will burn again , in part as a belated reaction to the horrors of Auschwitz .
Twenty Proofs of Euler 's Formula : V-E+F=2
Many theorems in mathematics are important enough that they have been proved repeatedly in surprisingly many different ways .
Examples of this include the existence of infinitely many prime numbers , the evaluation of zeta ( 2 ) , the fundamental theorem of algebra ( polynomials have roots ) , quadratic reciprocity ( a formula for testing whether an arithmetic progression contains a square ) and the Pythagorean theorem ( which according to Wells has at least 367 proofs ) .
This also sometimes happens for unimportant theorems , such as the fact that in any rectangle dissected into smaller rectangles , if each smaller rectangle has integer width or height , so does the large one .
This page lists proofs of the Euler formula : for any convex polyhedron , the number of vertices and faces together is exactly two more than the number of edges .
Symbolically V−E+F=2 .
For instance , a tetrahedron has four vertices , four faces , and six edges ; 4-6+4=2 .
A version of the formula dates over 100 years earlier than Euler , to Descartes in 1630 .
Descartes gives a discrete form of the Gauss - Bonnet theorem , stating that the sum of the face angles of a polyhedron is 2 π ( V − 2 ) , from which he infers that the number of plane angles is 2 F + 2 V - 4 .
The number of plane angles is always twice the number of edges , so this is equivalent to Euler 's formula , but later authors such as Lakatos , Malkevitch , and Polya disagree , feeling that the distinction between face angles and edges is too large for this to be viewed as the same formula .
The formula V−E+F=2 was ( re ) discovered by Euler ; he wrote about it twice in 1750 , and in 1752 published the result , with a faulty proof by induction for triangulated polyhedra based on removing a vertex and retriangulating the hole formed by its removal .
The retriangulation step does not necessarily preserve the convexity or planarity of the resulting shape , so the induction does not go through .
Another early attempt at a proof , by Meister in 1784 , is essentially the triangle removal proof given here , but without justifying the existence of a triangle to remove .
In 1794 , Legendre provided a complete proof , using spherical angles .
Cauchy got into the act in 1811 , citing Legendre and adding incomplete proofs based on triangle removal , ear decomposition , and tetrahedron removal from a tetrahedralization of a partition of the polyhedron into smaller polyhedra .
Hilton and Pederson provide more references as well as entertaining speculation on Euler 's discovery of the formula .
Confusingly , other equations such as ei pi = - 1 and aphi(n ) = 1 ( mod n ) also go by the name of " Euler 's formula " ; Euler was a busy man .
The polyhedron formula , of course , can be generalized in many important ways , some using methods described below .
One important generalization is to planar graphs .
To form a planar graph from a polyhedron , place a light source near one face of the polyhedron , and a plane on the other side .
The shadows of the polyhedron edges form a planar graph , embedded in such a way that the edges are straight line segments .
The faces of the polyhedron correspond to convex polygons that are faces of the embedding .
The face nearest the light source corresponds to the outside face of the embedding , which is also convex .
Conversely , any planar graph with certain connectivity properties comes from a polyhedron in this way .
Some of the proofs below use only the topology of the planar graph , some use the geometry of its embedding , and some use the three - dimensional geometry of the original polyhedron .
Graphs in these proofs will not necessarily be simple : edges may connect a vertex to itself , and two vertices may be connected by multiple edges .
Several of the proofs rely on the Jordan curve theorem , which itself has multiple proofs ; however these are not generally based on Euler 's formula so one can use Jordan curves without fear of circular reasoning .
I imagine it would be possible to construct inductions based on the representation of convex polyhedra as intersections of halfspaces or convex hulls of points , but the need to handle inputs in non-general position would make the resulting proofs quite messy .
There also seems to be a potential connection to binomials : if one defines a polynomial p(t ) = 1+Vt +Et2 +Ft3+t4 , the Euler formula can be interpreted as saying that p(t ) is divisible by 1+t .
But for simplices of any dimension , p(t ) =( 1+t ) d+1 by the binomial formula .
Perhaps there is a proof of Euler 's formula that uses these polynomials directly rather than merely translating one of the inductions into polynomial form .
Jim Propp asks similar questions for infinite - dimensional polytopes , interpreting p(t ) as a power series ( see also his recent expansion of these ideas ) .

Highlights from Anonymous ’ protest against the Church of Scientology , March 15th 2008 .
I was shooting in B &W with my film camera which explains the silly mix of B&W and colour images .
Forgive me .
Following on from the festivities at the February 10th protest , Anonymous are back to ‘ celebrate ’ L. Ron.
Hubbard ’s birthday , which was Thursday March 13th .
Queen Victoria Street
Two Anonymous have arrived 90 minutes early ; this appears to be the physical equivalent of “ First comment ! ”
While waiting for arrivals by Blackfriars Station I noticed these .
Cropped version
Anonymous arrive .
Nice City Policeman greets Anonymous outside Blackfriars Station to explain what the City Police are here to do and what they are not here to do .
Anonymous responds with an offering of Fox ’s .
City Policeman is hypnotised by the gift and accepts .
How could he refuse ?
Cake for everyone .
Mr Doublecakeanonymous here has a weighted companion cube cake .
THE CAKE IS REAL !
Miss Anonymous notices a strange reflection .
Today ’s turnout walked all over previous figures .
I could n’t fit everyone in one shot .
This is the first floor of the Church of Scientology ’s building .
Anonymous gave them a wave and a cheer .
Anonymous placards
Tottenham Court Road
Tottenham Court Road is where things got really interesting .
The road is a lot narrower than Queen Victoria Street , there is a huge amount of footfall ( public passers - by ) and Anonymous are concentrated into a much smaller area .
More Anonymous placards .
The memes were out in full force .
Two doors to the right of Scientology ’s branch is a branch of KFC .
One of the most amusing chants had everyone pointing and went : “ THAT IS A CHICKEN !
THAT IS A CULT !
THAT IS A CHICKEN !
THAT IS A CULT ! ”
Quite fond of stickers is this one .
Cake had successfully made it to Tottenham Court Road .
“ It ’s so moist and delicious ” , said one Anonymous while offering cake to me .
Anonymous came , Anonymous protested , Anonymous remained anonymous .
Response
In order to provide a more balanced report on the day ’s events this time round , I asked a Policeman if I could enter the building to ask the staff if the organisation had an official response to Anonymous ’ protests .
The policeman rejected my request however he did go in on my behalf .
A Scientology volunteer came out ( to boos ) and provided me with an email contact whom I could pose my questions to .
Scientology ’s statement follows .
Dear James , Following is our response .
I also recommend you go to www.anonymous-exposed.org for more specifics .
ANONYMOUS – HATE CRIMES AND
TERRORISM DIRECTED AT SCIENTOLOGY
Since January 17 , 2008 , “ Anonymous ” , a group of cyber - terrorists hiding
their identities behind masks and computer anonymity , has targeted the
Scientology religion , its Churches , leaders and parishioners with hate
speech and hate crimes .
To inform “ Anonymous ” members who may be unaware of the criminal acts
committed by their leaders , and to prevent others from being misled by
“ Anonymous ' ” propaganda , a video has been produced to provide the facts .
The video reveals “ Anonymous ' ” repeated incitements to hate and violence .
The Church has not interacted with these “ Anonymous ” individuals nor does
it desire to .
However , death threats and threats to plant nitroglycerin
bombs in Churches have made it necessary to take security precautions and
identify members of this group responsible for these crimes .
A copy of our documentary can be seen at www.anonymous-exposed.org.
If you have any further questions , please let me know .
Aftermath
Another peaceful protest from Anonymous .
I ’m glad I asked for and received a response from Scientology this time round so both sides were able to voice their opinion .
Anonymous distributed cake and leaflets to the general public .
They made themselves heard .
As I approached Tottenham Court Road I saw the general public walking away from the protest clutching Anonymous leaflets , reading them out loud and discussing Anonymous ’ beef with Scientology .
Anonymous ’ message is certainly getting out there .
Looking at Scientology ’s response and their claims of threats against them including Nitroglycerin bombs – if you consider their history then I think it is fair to say they suffer from ‘ boy who cried wolf ’ syndrome .
Because of past failures , what they say must be taken with a pinch of salt .
It ’s hard to trust the words of an organisation that has previously conducted such exercises as ‘ Operation Snow White ‘ and ‘ Operation Freakout ‘ .
Is Anonymous a collective of Nitroglycerin bomb - threatening eTerrorists ?

If that ’s the case , you probably missed me and Jon Stewart playing Rock ‘ Em Sock ‘ Em Robots last week .
It started civilly enough , discussing my new book , “ Liberal Fascism . ”
But things got sufficiently testy that we spent nearly 20 minutes swearing and sparring , and only six minutes aired .
The result was “ choppy as hell , ” Stewart had to concede .
Largely left on the cutting - room floor were some important points that might have made my book seem a bit more nuanced .
When he railed about conservatives and gay marriage , I pointed out that in my book , I ’m sympathetic to it .
When he took shots at Republicans , I noted that I criticize the likes of President Bush and Pat Buchanan for being “ right - wing progressives . ”
Viewers in search of more than disjointed , stuttering cross talk would be disappointed if they caught the whole exchange -- it was all like that .
Stewart , try as he might , could not understand where I ’m coming from .
Advertisement
His stated problem , in a nutshell , was that he did n’t like the book ’s title or its cover ( bright red with a smiley face -- oh , and the smiley face has a little Hitler mustache on it ) .
Stewart ’s complaint , echoed all over the Web , radio and TV by other critics , is that books can indeed be judged by the cover .
And because the title and cover amount to a giant insult to liberals ( only Stewart did n’t use the word “ insult ” ) , it can be dismissed out of hand .
I tried to explain , for those whose feelings were so hurt they did n’t even crack the spine , that the title “ Liberal Fascism ” comes from a speech delivered by H.G. Wells , one of the most important and influential progressive and socialist intellectuals of the 20th century .
He wanted to re-brand liberalism as “ liberal fascism ” and even “ enlightened Nazism . ”
He believed these terms best described his own political views -- views that deeply informed American progressivism and New Deal liberalism .
As for the smiley face , that ’s a reference to the comedian and social commentator George Carlin , who explained on HBO ’s “ Real Time with Bill Maher ” that “ when fascism comes to America , it will not be in brown and black shirts .
It will not be with jack - boots .
It will be Nike sneakers and smiley shirts .
Smiley - smiley . ”
I ’m persuaded that Carlin was right -- to the extent that fascism of any kind will come to America , it will do so in the guise of something “ progressive . ”
Indeed , American progressives , particularly before Hitler arrived on the scene in the 1930s , were openly sympathetic to Italian fascism .
This is n’t to say they copied it ( or the fascism of Soviet Russia ) , as many claim .
But rather that the ideas that gave birth to and fueled American progressivism -- philosophical pragmatism , Bismarckian “ top - down socialism , ” Marxism , eugenics and more -- share common intellectual sources and impulses with those that gave us both socialism and fascism .

We ’ve allowed the staggering moral horror of the Holocaust to color our conception of what fascism was .
But Wells , the editors of the New Republic and such muckrakers as Lincoln Steffens and Ida Tarbell did n’t have any idea the Holocaust would happen when they endorsed Benito Mussolini ’s efforts .
Meanwhile , liberals routinely and cavalierly call conservatives Nazis and fascists -- with the Holocaust fully in mind -- without inviting an ounce of opprobrium from the same folks screeching about me .
Naomi Wolf argues in “ The End of America ” that the United States today is in every important way identical to early 1930s Nazi Germany .
Christopher Hedges ( a former New York Times reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner ) penned a book called , subtly enough , “ American Fascists . ”
Guess who he was talking about ?
Jesse Jackson , Paul Krugman and Bill Clinton , among other prominent liberals , have insinuated or declared that conservatives are the spiritual or intellectual heirs of Nazism .
Such charges are simply false .
We ’ve come to use the word “ fascist ” as a substitute for “ evil ” or “ bad . ”
The left in particular has institutionalized argumentum ad hitlerum as a means of delegitimizing viewpoints they find objectionable .
That ’s why Al Gore calls his online critics “ digital brownshirts ” and suggests anyone who ignores his warnings are akin to those who willingly ignored the Holocaust .
As much as it may shock some , I ’m not the first person to set the record straight .
Maybe those authors did n’t penetrate the public debate because they tend to write books titled “ Illiberal Policymaking and Culture Formation , the Anglo - American Experience , 1912 - 2007 . ”
If I ’d followed their example , no one would be buying my book , reading it or discussing it .
And , you can be sure , I would n’t have been invited on to “ The Daily Show ” to get smacked around for 20 minutes .

Today we ’re releasing an update to our “ Peggy ” open - source LED Pegboard project .
Peggy version 2 has been redesigned from the ground up .
And it looks … almost exactly the same .
The changes under the hood are substantial , though , and we think that it ’s a big improvement in many ways .
First and foremost , Peggy 2.0 still does the same darn thing : it provides efficient power to a 25 x 25 array of LED locations .
Peggy is designed to take some of the sting , complexity , and mess out of playing with LEDs .
It ’s a versatile and powerful light - emitting pegboard that lets you efficiently drive hundreds of LEDs in whatever configuration you like , without so much as calculating a single load resistor .
You can install anywhere from one to 625 LEDs , and Peggy will light them up for you .
Peggy can optionally be reprogrammed to do much more , of course .
The biggest change is that the Peggy 2.0 hardware now supports simple animation capability with individually addressable LED locations .
Besides the microcontroller , there are now four support chips that help to drive the rows and columns of the display .
Now , we ’re not talking live video feeds or long movies here ( speed and memory considerations will spoil that party ) , but you might be surprised how much you can do with a little AVR microcontroller .
The second improvement has to do with the programming interfaces .
As before , Peggy supports programming through a regular AVR ISP ( in - system programming ) connection , such as the USBtinyISP .
However Peggy 2.0 is now also Arduino compatible : it supports programming through a USB - TTL cable , using the popular Arduino software environment .
( This is the same programming arrangement that you ’ll find on some of the popular Arduino - compatible boards such as the Boarduino and Bare Bones Boards . )
Other improvements and new features :
The size of the circuit board has been slightly tweaked to 11.320 X 14.87 ″ .
The new narrower width allows multiple Peggy 2.0 boards that are lined up side by side to form an uninterrupted LED field .
A small breadboard - style prototyping area
16 MHz crystal oscillator for improved timing and communications
Extra space to add up to five optional tactile buttons including four “ arrow ” keys .
Could come in handy if you are using Peggy as a game platform .
Peggy 2.0 now uses the popular ATmega168 - 20 PU microcontroller .
An awful lot of existing Arduino code can run on it without modification .
Full - size power slider switch now standard equipment .
Still fully open source and designed to be hacked .
Schematics , code , and extra access points are provided .
Here are some project ideas that might be fun to try with Peggy 2.0 :
Boring old static LED sign .
LED clock with digits .
BIG digits .
Scrolling readerboard .
Low - speed oscilloscope .
FFT sound grapher .
Mega MiniPOV !
Add a temperature sensor in the prototyping area and make a giant display thermometer .
Add a EEPROM in the prototyping area to store data for a long animation .
Variable color LED panel , fading between different color LEDs in different areas .
14×14 RGB display , clumping three LED locations to form an RGB pixel .
RSS reader ?
Mega -emoticon display for use in car
Simulated animated neon sign .
Open / closed sign that states your hours , too .
True sprite animation
Simple video games !
LED status board .
Blinkylight array for your sci - fi movie computer set .
Since the full display is addressable , there ’s really a wide - open set of potential applications .
As a first demonstration I wrote a version of Conway ’s game of Life .
It ’s not written from scratch ; it ’s adapted from this project by David Gustafik , and the code is available under the GPL .
We ’re embedding a little YouTube video here ; if you ca n’t see it , you can click through to YouTube .
How do you make it ?
This project is fully documented , open source , hacker friendly , and you can approach it from any direction you want .
Start with the schematics and code , or start with a circuit board and a soldering iron .
It ’s all yours :
Get a kit here .
Build instructions , schematics , and bill of materials are all wrapped up in one big PDF here ( 10 MB PDF File )
Learn about programming Peggy 2.0 in a separate article here .
The circuit board was designed in gEDA PCB , and you can download the original PCB file here ;
Fundamentally , it ’s also source code ; we are releasing it under the GPL .
Want to talk about it ?
That ’s what the forums are for .
FAQ :
1 . What ’s this all about ?
This is an easy way to drive a lot of LEDs– up to 625 – in a big matrix .
You can make an LED sign for your window , a geeky valentine for your sweetie , one bad - ass birthday card , or freak the holy bejesus out of Boston .
Your call .
It ’s a versatile , high - brightness display .
The display can run off an AC adapter or batteries ( 3 ‘ D’ cells ) , and is designed to run as LEDs as you care to solder into the holes , all with excellent brightness .
The board can accommodate LEDs in several common sizes : 3 mm , 5 mm ( standard T - 1 3/4 size ) , and 10 mm .
2 . Do I have to put the LEDs on the grid , or can I position them exactly where I want to ?
You do not have to place every LED on a regular grid .
See the instructions for some tips on how to position the LEDs more arbitrarily .
3 . Do the LEDs get soldered in the holes ?
Yup .
If you do want to add sockets , go right ahead .
( Peggy is designed to be hacked . )
However , keep in mind that you ’ll probably end up doing more soldering in total , and those sockets cost more than you might think .
4 . Does the Arduino Bootloader come preinstalled on chips in the kits ?
Does it work ?
Is this the world ’s biggest Arduino ?
Yes , yes , and no .
Use a USB - TTL cable and tell the Arduino software that you have a Diecimila .
It works well .
While the board is big , it is technically not “ an Arduino ” , as per
guidelines issued by the Arduino team .
( Arduino is the proper name of a hardware + software platform , so the term “ an Arduino ” is a bit misleading in any case . )
Peggy 2.0 is merely open - source hardware that happens to be compatible with the Arduino software development environment .
( And no , we wo n’t rename it Pegguino . )
5 . What is the default program installed on the chips in the kits ?
First , we load the Arduino bootloader onto the chips , and then we load up the default program , which lights up every LED location on the board .
That way the board will work correctly if you just start using it , but it will also accept reprogramming through the Arduino environment , or ( as always ) accept programming with an AVR - ISP programmer .
6 . Is “ Peggy ” named after someone ?
Nope .
It just comes from the term “ pegboard . ”
7 . What does Peggy 1.0 have that Peggy 2.0 does n’t ?
10 Conspiracy Theories

Conspiracy .
Just saying the word in conversation can make people politely edge away , looking for someone who wo n’t corner them with wild theories about how Elvis , John F. Kennedy , and Bigfoot are cryogenically frozen in an underground bunker .
Yet conspiracies do exist .
In the corporate world , major companies we buy products from everyday have been found guilty of conspiring to fix prices and reduce competition .
Just about any planned criminal act committed by more than one person could be considered a conspiracy , from simple murder - for - hire to the Watergate break - in .
Many conspiracy theorists go much further , though , and see a hidden hand behind the world ’s major events .
While some of the theories have a grain of truth to them , conspiracy theories are impossible to disprove , because the hardcore believers will find some way to rationalize away evidence that contradicts their beliefs .
Eyewitnesses who dispute their conclusions are mistaken — or part of the conspiracy .
At least that 's what they want you to think ...
The 9/11 Conspiracies
( Image credit : Public domain image )
The evidence is overwhelming that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , were indeed the result of a conspiracy .
There 's no doubt about it : A close ( or even cursory ) look at the evidence makes it clear that it was carefully planned and executed by conspirators .
The question , of course , is who those conspirators were .
Osama bin Laden and the crew of ( mostly Saudi ) hijackers were part of the conspiracy , but what about President Bush and Vice - President Dick Cheney ?
Did top Bush advisors , including Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld , either collaborate with bin Laden , or intentionally allow the attacks to happen ?
Put another way , was it an inside job ?
Conspiracy theorists believe so , and point to a catalog of supposed inconsistencies in the " official version " of the attacks .
Many of the technical conspiracy claims were debunked by Popular Mechanics magazine in March 2005 , while other claims are refuted by simple logic :
If a hijacked airplane did not crash into the Pentagon , as is often claimed , then where is Flight 77 and its passengers ?
Are they with the Roswell aliens at Hangar 18 ?
In many conspiracy theories , bureaucratic incompetence is often mistaken for conspiracy .
Our government is so efficient , knowledgeable , and capable — so the reasoning goes — that it could not possibly have botched the job so badly in detecting the plot ahead of time or responding to the attacks .
I find that hard to believe .
Princess Diana's Murder
( Image credit : Pubic Domain , Paddy Briggs )
Within hours of Princess Diana 's death on Aug. 31 , 1997 , in a Paris highway tunnel , conspiracy theories swirled .
As was the case with the death of John F. Kennedy , the idea that such a beloved and high - profile figure could be killed so suddenly was a shock .
This was especially true of Princess Diana ; royalty die of old age , political intrigue , or eating too much rich food ; they do n't get killed by a common drunk driver .
Unlike many conspiracy theories , though , this one had a billionaire promoting it : Mohamed Al - Fayed , the father of Dodi Al - Fayed , who was killed along with Diana .
Al - Fayed claims that the accident was in fact an assassination by British intelligence agencies , at the request of the Royal Family .
Al - Fayed 's claims were examined and dismissed as baseless by a 2006 inquiry ; the following year , at Diana 's inquest , the coroner stated that " The conspiracy theory advanced by Mohamed Al Fayed has been minutely examined and shown to be without any substance . "
On April 7 of this year , the coroner 's jury concluded that Diana and Al - Fayed were unlawfully killed due to negligence by their drunken chauffer and pursuing paparazzi .
Subliminal Advertising
Ever been watching a movie and suddenly get the munchies ?
Or sitting on your sofa watching TV and suddenly get the irresistible urge to buy a new car ?
If so , you may be the victim of a subliminal advertising conspiracy !
Proponents include Wilson Bryan Key ( author of " Subliminal Seduction " ) and Vance Packard ( author of " The Hidden Persuaders " ) , both of whom claimed that subliminal ( subconscious ) messages in advertising were rampant and damaging .
Though the books caused a public outcry and led to FCC hearings , much of both books have since been discredited , and several key " studies " of the effects of subliminal advertising were revealed to have been faked .
In the 1980s , concern over subliminal messages spread to bands such as Styx and Judas Priest , with the latter band even being sued in 1990 for allegedly causing a teen 's suicide with subliminal messages ( the case was dismissed ) .
Subliminal mental processing does exist , and can be tested .
But just because a person perceives something ( a message or advertisement , for example ) subconsciously means very little by itself .
There is no inherent benefit of subliminal advertising over regular advertising , any more than there would be in seeing a flash of a commercial instead of the full twenty seconds .
Getting a person to see something for a split - second is easy ; filmmakers do it all the time ( watch the last few frames in Hitchcock 's classic " Psycho " ) .
Getting a person to buy or do something based on that split - second is another matter entirely .
( The conspiracy was parodied in the 1980s television show Max Headroom , in which viewers were exploding after seeing subliminal messages called " blipverts . " )
The Moon Landing Hoax
( Image credit : NASA . )
In the 1978 film Capricorn One , American astronauts and NASA faked a Mars landing .
Though a mediocre film , it was an interesting idea , and one that would endure for decades .
In 2001 , Fox television aired the program " Conspiracy Theory : Did We Land on the Moon ? , " which rehashed many discredited " discrepancies " between the official version of the moon landing and photographs of the landing .
( Curiously , they never explain why NASA would distribute photographs that would " prove " that they had faked the moon landing . )
Websites such as BadAstronomy.com have pages and pages of point - by - point , detailed refutations of the Fox claims .
Of course , even if there was some credible evidence showing that the 1969 Apollo moon landing was a hoax , conspiracy theorists must also account for later moon missions , involving a dozen astronauts .
And there 's the issue of the hundreds of pounds of moon rocks that have been studied around the world and verified as of extraterrestrial origin… how did NASA get the rocks if not during a moon landing ?
Many astronauts have been offended by the implication that they faked their accomplishments .
In fact in 2002 , when conspiracy theorist Bart Sibrel confronted Buzz Aldrin and called him a " coward and a liar " for faking the moon landings , the 72 - year - old punched Sibrel in the jaw .
Paul McCartney 's Death
( Image credit : Public Domain )
According to many stories and conspiracy theories that circulated in the late 1960s , Beatles guitarist Paul McCartney died in 1966 .
The remaining members of the Beatles — along with their manager and others — conspired to keep McCartney 's death a secret , going so far as to hire a look - alike and sound - alike to take his place in the band .
Well , kind of :
In a case of seriously twisted logic ( even by conspiracy theory standards ) the conspirators in this case took great pains to keep the press and public from finding out about McCartney 's demise — yet they also wanted fans to know about it , and placed clever clues in album covers and music giving details about McCartney 's death .
For example , on the cover of the Abbey Road album , all four Beatles are photographed striding across a zebra crossing , but only McCartney is barefoot , and out of step with the other three .
This must mean something , right ?
Despite public denials by the band , fans could n't just let it be , and came together to look for more clues .
John F. Kennedy ’s Assassination
( Image credit : Library of Congress )
John F. Kennedy was killed in 1963 in a Dallas motorcade .
Who killed Kennedy ?
Most ( though not all ) conspiracy theorists acknowledge that Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy from a book depository .
Beyond this fact lies a vast area of conspiracy theory that has spawned endless speculation and hundreds of books , articles , and films .
Was there a second assassin , perhaps one at a nearby " grassy knoll " ?
And if Oswald did act alone , who gave him the orders ?
Activists against Fidel Castro ?
Organized crime bosses ?
A jealous husband upset with Kennedy 's philandering ?
Though the Warren Commission report concluded that Oswald acted alone , a 1979 report by The House Select Committee on Assassinations suggested that there was in fact a conspiracy , and likely more than one shooter .
In such a complex and sensational case , the conspiracy theories will live on .
.
The Roswell Crash Cover-Up
( Image credit : Dreamstime.com )
There is one fact that almost all skeptics and believers agree on : Something crashed on a remote ranch outside of Roswell , New Mexico in 1947 .
The government at first claimed it was some sort of saucer , then retracted the statement and claimed it was really a weather balloon .
Yet the best evidence suggests that it was neither a flying saucer nor a weather balloon , but instead a high - altitude , top - secret military balloon dubbed Project Mogul .
As it turns out , descriptions of the wreckage first reported by the original eyewitnesses very closely match photos of the Project Mogul balloons , down to the silvery finish and strange symbols on its side .
The stories about crashed alien bodies did not surface until decades later and in fact no one considered the Roswell crash as anything extraterrestrial or unusual until thirty years later , when a book on the topic was published .
There was indeed a cover - up , but it did not hide a crashed saucer , instead it hid a Cold War -era spying program .
Protocols of the Elders of Zion
( Image credit : unknown , Public Domain )
" The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion " is a hoaxed book that purported to reveal a Jewish conspiracy to achieve world domination .
It first appeared in Russia in 1905 , and described how Christians ' morality , finances , and health would be targeted by a small group of powerful Jews .
The idea that there is a Jewish conspiracy is nothing new , of course , and has been repeated by many prominent people including Henry Ford and Mel Gibson .
In 1920 , Henry Ford paid to have half a million copies of " The Protocols of the Elders of Zion " published , and in the 1930s , the book was used by the Nazis as justification for its genocide against Jews ( in fact , Adolph Hitler referred to the " Protocols " in his book " Mein Kampf " ) .
Though the book has been completely discredited as a hoax and forgery , it is still in print and remains widely circulated around the world .
Satanic Cults
( Image credit : © Dana Rothstein | Dreamstime.com )
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s , a rash of child abuse cases horrified America .
Children accused adults of ritual rapes , torture , and abuse , and the news media reported the sensational stories .
Often the accusations included charges of Satanism .
The pinnacle was Geraldo Rivera 's infamous NBC special " Devil Worship : Exposing Satan 's Underground , " which aired on Oct. 28 , 1988 .
Rivera relied on self - proclaimed " Satanism experts , " misleading and inaccurate statistics , crimes with only tenuous links to Satanism , and sensationalized media reports .
In what was the largest viewership for a documentary in television history , Rivera claimed that an organized , Satanic conspiracy was at work killing babies , murdering innocents , and conducting ghastly rituals .
" There are over one million Satanists in this country , " Rivera said , adding that " The odds are , [ they ] are in your town . "
Rivera presented no proof ; the lack of evidence was seen as proof of how well organized and shrewd the Satanic conspiracy really was .
Yet little evidence supports claims about Satanic cults or conspiracies .
In a 1992 report on ritual crime , FBI agent Kenneth Lanning concluded that the rampant rumors of ritual murders , cannibalism , and kidnapping were unfounded .
Phillips Stevens , Jr. , associate professor of anthropology at the State University of New York at Buffalo , said that the widespread allegations of crimes by Satanists " constitute the greatest hoax perpetrated upon the American people in the twentieth century . "
Big Pharma
( Image credit : © Luzav10 | Dreamstime.com )
Almost everybody ( except investors ) loves to hate the drug companies .
Drugs cost too much , drug company profits are obscene , and it seems that every few months some drug once claimed to be safe is yanked off the shelf after patients die .
It 's little wonder that the drug industry ( " Big Pharma " ) is looked upon with suspicion .
But some proponents of " alternative medicine " believe that drug companies actually conspire to keep people sick to reap profits .
For example , Kevin Trudeau ( bestselling author of " Natural Cures They Don't Want You To Know About " ) claims that important medical information is being kept hidden by a conspiracy between the medical establishment and big drug companies .
According to Trudeau , " There are certain groups , including ... the drug industry ... that do n’t want people to know about cures for diseases ... "
Actress and model Jenny McCarthy appeared on " Larry King Live , " accusing doctors and the pharmaceutical industry of conspiring to suppress evidence of a link between childhood vaccines and autism .

BURBANK , Calif . — Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday that her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination , Senator Barack Obama , had been “ timid and unenthusiastic ” in his proposals for dealing with the current economic downturn .
She also said that Senator John McCain , the likely Republican nominee , would simply continue what she called the failed economic policies of President Bush .
Mrs. Clinton , on the other hand , called herself “ Paulette Revere , ” having warned for more than a year of an impending slide in housing and financial markets and the broader economy .
“ I have continued to sound the alarm , ” she said at an airport press conference in Burbank , Calif .
“ Sometimes I feel like Paulette Revere :
The recession is coming , the recession is coming .
I hope someone will do something about this besides wring their hands , which is not in the best interest of our country . ”
Mrs. Clinton repeated the assertion she made in a campaign advertisement on Wednesday that she was the best equipped candidate in either party to answer a 3 a .m. phone call on an economic crisis .
“ Senator McCain would simply continue the failed economic strategy that has brought us record deficits and a recession under President Bush , ” she said .
“ We need a candidate who can win this debate over the economy . ”
Asked whether she believed Mr. Obama could not win that debate , she equivocated .
“ I am running because I think I could be the best president , ” she said .
She denied reports that she had told Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico that Mr. Obama could not win a general election campaign against Mr. McCain .
Mr. Richardson endorsed Mr. Obama last month , setting off charges of betrayal by Clinton partisans .
While saying that she did not discuss private conversations , Mrs. Clinton said she had always couched her electability argument in positive terms .
She said she thought she would be the best candidate and the best president .
“ I have consistently made the case that I can win because I believe I can win , ” Mrs. Clinton said .
“ I can win .
I know I can win .
That ’s why I do this every day . ”
Mrs. Clinton has said in the past that she and Mr. McCain are qualified to be commander in chief and Mr. Obama is not .
Her advisers have also explicitly questioned Mr. Obama ’s suitability for the Oval Office .
And it is a central conceit of the Clinton campaign that she would be a much stronger general election candidate against Mr. McCain .
They base their conclusion on her performance in big states and among groups of voters she and her advisers consider to be key parts of a winning Democratic coalition – women , Catholics , Latinos and lower - income voters .

Most of you usually fall into a very bad daily routine , starting with skipping breakfast , wolfing down on a quick and unhealthy lunch , a lot of soda , candies and chips in between your meals and gorging with unhealthy food in the evening .
Overtime , this unhealthy eating habit becomes a daily routine of your life and it will become difficult to get out of such habits .
So it is essential for you that you manage to change all those bad eating habits quickly , to live a happy life without any health complications .
Do you know those unhealthy eating habits ?
If not , here is a list of unhealthy eating habits to avoid in your regular routine .
1.Skipping breakfast
As far as healthy eating habits are concerned , skipping your morning breakfast is fairly bad one .
Starting your day with a healthy breakfast not only boosts your mood and energy , but also helps a lot with managing to make some healthy choices during the rest of your day .
2.Watching TV while eating
Do you watch TV while eating ?
Then it is very important for you to know that this is the most disgusting and unhealthy habit of eating .
You will lose concentration on eating while watching T.V .
It also increases the chances of eating more food than required , which leads to a higher intake of high calorie food .
3. Having only three meals a day
Studies have shown that eating small meals more frequently helps to prevent your habit of overeating .
This strategy of “ little and more frequent meals ” also improves your body metabolism rate .
4.Eating before going to bed
Eating spicy , fatty foods or consuming caffeine before bedtime can significantly reduce your quality and length of sleep .
So , if you just ca n’t avoid echoing of your stomach before bedtime , then simply snack on fresh fruits and vegetables .
5.Ignoring the nutritional facts mentioned on the food products
Your body needs certain calories to function everyday .
In order to ensure that you do n’t exceed your intake of calorie level , you have to read the labels on food products before buying .
Experts recommend to read the nutritional facts that are quite honest than the actual commercials .
It is also a good option to avoid the consumption of unwanted and unhealthy calories .
6.Eating without an appropriate idea
When you feel hungry , you simply rush to eat any sort of food , without assessing on what you are eating .
That is why it ’s very important for you to spend some time thinking before you start eating and try to ensure that the food that you are going to consume contains low fat and cholesterol .
7.Blowing up your well - balanced diet in weekends
You have succeeded in maintaining a well - balanced diet throughout the week , but during the weekend people tend to reward them selves a little too much .
As a result , you ’ll tend to add more calories in your diet during weekends .
This is not at all a good idea for you if you want to maintain better health .
So try to control your food cravings in the weekends .
According to the latest studies some people are typically inclined to add extra calories on every Friday , Saturday and Sunday .
So a little caution on the weekend should work on the long term .
8. Higher levels of cravings towards junk food
Many of you cannot resist the cravings towards junk food .
Once again , it ’s essential for you to know that these high calorie or fat foods can increase your risk of developing serious health complications over time in your life .
9.Leaving the fresh fruits and vegetables out
Eating fruit and vegetable flavored foods do not provide vitamins and proteins , which are actually available in fresh fruits and vegetables .
The only way to get essential vitamins and proteins is to add more fresh fruits and vegetables in your regular diet plan .
10 . Bad breakfast
Do you know that you should not skip your breakfast ?
It does n’t mean that you have to include more fatty foods like doughnuts or pastries in your breakfast .
Your breakfast must include more calcium sources , fiber foods and low carb products .
Eat fruits , complex carbohydrates , and fiber food regularly after you wake up in the morning to avoid over consumption of foods at lunch and dinner time .
11 . Giving up your control on diet at special events
Just because you are at your best friend ’s party , you cannot consume high calorie food , particularly if you have decided to follow a healthy balanced diet .
Whenever you plan for a party or going to attend a party as guest , have some salads or handful of almonds to avoid overeating .
12 . Eating while you are on some other work
Eating while doing some other work not only wrecks your clothes and makes a mess , but it also leads to overeating .
As a result , you will end up gaining more weight .
So you should always concentrate on the food you that you ’re eating .
13 . Developing emotional eating
After a tough schedule at your work , a beer and cheese pizza can sound perfectly good when compared to a soup or salad .
Therefore , you prefer to take beer and cheese pizza .
But you should realize that those things are not good for your health as they develop emotional eating tendency .
14 . Eating quickly
If you are a speed eater then try to realize that munching on food really quick is very bad and unhealthy habit of eating .
Gulping the food can set your stomach into many troubles .
So try to slow down the eating process and also stay away from finger foods .
Eating slowly does n’t essentially mean that you must take long hours to complete your meal .
Try to spend at least 10 - 15 minutes for meals in your regular routine .
15 . Relying on convenience food
After experiencing a hectic schedule in your day , you will not spend even an hour to prepare healthy food .
You prefer to have anything as long as it ’s ready made and easily available .
These packed and available foods can create problems to your health .
Instead , prepare food for yourself with patience or have fresh fruits and vegetables .
16. Starving
If you think starving can help in losing your body weight , then come out from such kind of misconception .
It will put on some extra weight to your body because your body stores more amount of fat while you starve .
If your intention is to lose weight with starving , then try to eat fresh fruits and vegetables instead of starving .
You can also try various weight loss diet plans to lose those extra pounds .
17 . Eating more in bad mood
Sounds strange !
But it ’s a fact that many people actually tend to eat more food particularly when they are in a bad mood .
Many people consume more carbohydrates and extra calories when they are in bad circumstances or in depressed situations .
If you are in those situations , try to change the treatment options for depression and stress for healthy eating and healthy life .
Try to stay away from these particular habits as much as possible in order to live a healthy life .
Take note of the suggestions from your dietician regarding healthy eating habits and try to consider them in maintaining a smart and healthy life .

The scope of concerns about the possible ill effects of a contaminated blood thinner from China grew significantly Tuesday as federal regulators urged makers of many kinds of medical devices that contain the drug to test their supplies .
The products to be tested cover a spectrum of equipment and uses .
They include kits that flush out intravenous lines , drug - coated stents for opening clogged arteries and certain diagnostic tests that use heparin and could deliver inaccurate results if contaminated .
Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Karen Riley said the recommendation was “ largely a precautionary move . ”
The agency has received two reports of serious allergic reactions linked to medical devices that contained heparin .
The reactions to the blood thinner are similar to those seen in some patients who received intravenous heparin that was recalled this year .
Riley said the FDA would send letters to 82 medical device manufacturers urging them to test their heparin .

“ We are aware that some of these products have been affected by the recent contamination , ” Riley said .
Separately , the FDA released statistics on deaths linked to intravenous heparin , the form of the drug in which problems were first detected .
The numbers showed an increase in fatalities from November 2007 through February 2008 , with problems rapidly abating last month after Baxter Healthcare Corp. issued a recall .
Many of the patients who receive the blood thinner are already in fragile condition , and some can experience severe side effects even if the drug is pure .
The particular side effect that investigators are focusing on is a severe allergic reaction that can lead to a sudden and highly dangerous drop in blood pressure .
The statistics showed that the number of reported deaths jumped from two in October -- a fairly typical number -- to eight in November , and reached a peak of 16 in January .
It was the sudden increase in such reports that prompted Baxter to alert the FDA to the problem .

The FDA ’s statistics showed 62 deaths associated with the severe reaction in the 15 months from January 2007 through last month -- an increase from the agency ’s previous count .
Of these reported deaths , 47 came in the four - month period in which reports of problems suddenly shot up .
Baxter contends that none of the deaths have been conclusively tied to its product .
China is the world ’s leading supplier of heparin , a blood thinner often made from a substance in the intestines of pigs .
It is commonly given to prevent blood clots in heart surgery and dialysis patients .
Baxter ’s heparin was contaminated with a look - alike ingredient that mimicked heparin in standard tests of drug potency and purity .
The FDA announced last month that it had identified the contaminant as a modified form of a common nutritional supplement .
That substance is cheaper to produce than heparin , leading to suspicions that it may have been intentionally added somewhere along a complex and lightly regulated supply chain in China .

The look - alike substance was identified using special tests , which the FDA is now asking medical device manufacturers to employ .
Riley said the agency was recommending that doctors and hospitals be alert to any serious side effects in patients using medical devices that contain heparin and be prepared to deliver emergency treatment .
The FDA also urged doctors to be on the lookout for any puzzling test results in diagnostic kits that use heparin .

Two dozen guys are crowded into a basement , talking loudly over Triscuits , when Scott Oberman breaks the law .
In defiance of Alabama Criminal Code 28 - 4 - 20 , he pours his buddy a beer .
“ John Tipton ’s Chocolate Porter , ” he announces .
It ’s a dark brown beer , almost black , with a taste that starts out astringent , like cheap red wine , then mellows into a silky chocolate flavor , with fleeting notes of coffee and cinnamon .
Tipton , a big - bellied mechanical engineer , brewed it at home , for fun .
That ’s illegal in Alabama .
He estimates the beer is about 8 % alcohol by volume .
That ’s illegal , too .

But it wo n’t be for long , if the guys in the basement get their way .
Seventy - five years after Prohibition , beer aficionados in Alabama are fighting for the right to brew and chug as they please .
That ’s raised the ire of Southern Baptists , who frown on alcohol in any form .
As they jockey for advantage in the Legislature , one side quotes Scripture .
The other cites BeerAdvocate.com .
One talks morality .
The other , malt .
Though this may seem like an only - in - the - Bible - Belt brawl , booze - related debates have flared recently in a number of states .
In Virginia , for instance , sangria was the talk of the statehouse after a Spanish restaurant was cited for illegally mixing brandy with wine , in violation of a 1930s - era statute .
Idaho lawmakers may soon amend the criminal code to permit vodka sales on election days .
And in Colorado , lawmakers have considered rescinding a law that bans supermarkets ( but not liquor stores ) from selling wine with more than 3.2 % alcohol content .

Here in Alabama , home - brewing beer has long been a Class A misdemeanor , with a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $ 2,000 fine .
It ’s another Class A misdemeanor to sell or distribute any beer with more than 6 % alcohol content .
That puts off - limits 85 of the 100 top-rated beers in the world , as ranked by BeerAdvocate.com .
“ They think everyone down here is a bunch of damn rednecks and all we drink is Budweiser , ” grumbles Tipton , 48 .
Whole categories of beer ca n’t be sold in Alabama ( except on federal military bases , where the state law does n’t apply ) .
Among the forbidden brews : thick , dark Russian stouts , smoky Scottish ales , bittersweet barleywines and the legendary beers made by Belgium ’s Trappist monks .
What ’s left ?
Not much that Oberman and his friends would want to drink .

So as they wait for their legislative lobbying to bear fruit , they gather monthly for illicit tasting sessions , where they pass around up to a dozen home brews to critique .
At the moment , they ’re sampling a murky - looking concoction billed as an Imperial Stout and served from a 2 - liter bottle that once contained Diet Mountain Dew .
“ It ’s clean , it ’s nice , but it ’s not big or bold enough , ” says Todd Swearingen , 41 .
Adam Arnett , 42 , takes a small sip from a shot glass , savoring the flavors before swallowing .
“ Does n’t punch you in the face , ” he says .
They pour the rest of the stout into a large plastic garbage can and move on to the next offering .
Oberman ’s basement , lit by a bare bulb dangling from the ceiling insulation , is loud and warm ; not surprisingly , it smells like a brewery .
Jim Trollinger , 46 , a big man with a wild beard , takes in the scene with a grin .
“ This is all an exercise in civil disobedience , ” he says proudly .

In fact , Alabama authorities rarely prosecute anyone for home - brewing , or for possessing beer with more than 6 % alcohol content .
By law , residents may enjoy such beers only if they order them shipped from an out - of - state vendor to a government warehouse , run by the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board .
They can pick up the shipment after paying taxes and certifying that the beers are exclusively for their personal use .
Few drinkers trouble with that bureaucracy .
Brew crusaders , banded together in a group called Free the Hops , admit to driving up to four hours each way on beer runs to Tennessee or Georgia .
Some bring back as much as $ 500 worth of booze every few months .
On this evening , Oberman plans to raffle a dozen smuggled beers , including a Sierra Nevada Bigfoot ale , a Belgian Lambic infused with raspberries and a microbrew , Nugget Nectar .

“ What ’s done in a private home often goes undiscovered , ” says John Richardson , assistant administrator of the alcohol control board .
“ You can imagine how confusing it is trying to enforce this . ”
California does not impose special restrictions on beer sales .
But across the South , many states have long tried to keep out high - alcohol beer .
Those laws were overturned in South Carolina , North Carolina and Georgia in recent years .
This year , campaigns are underway here and in West Virginia and Mississippi .
Free the Hops , which claims 750 dues - paying members , has introduced two bills in Alabama : one to legalize home - brewing and the other to permit sales of beer with alcohol content of up to 13.9 % by volume .
Last week the state House approved the measure raising the alcohol limit in beer ; the Senate is expected to take it up soon .
The home - brew bill has not been scheduled for debate .
Arguing that alcohol can corrupt body , mind and soul , Alabama ’s Southern Baptists , a politically powerful group , are fighting to derail the 13.9 % bill in the Senate .

The Bible contains many references to drinking ; Jesus himself famously turned water into wine .
But Joe Bob Mizzell , director of Christian ethics for the Alabama Baptist State Convention , prefers to quote from the Apostle Paul : “ Be not drunk with wine but filled with the spirit . ”
Abusing alcohol , Mizzell concludes , “ inhibits communion with God . ”
The Rev. Dan Ireland , a former preacher who leads an advocacy group billed as “ Alabama ’s Moral Compass , ” has spent considerable time in the Capitol lobbying against the bill on practical as well as theological grounds .
He says legislators seem responsive to his warnings that high - alcohol beer will endanger teenagers , making it easier for them to get drunk .
“ We ’re losing too many kids now on the road because of drinking and driving .
Why aggravate that ? ” says state Rep. DuWayne Bridges .
Advertisement
Stuart Carter , the president of Free the Hops , counters that most of the higher - alcohol beers do not appeal to teens .
They ’re thicker , more complex , often more bitter .
They ’re also considerably more expensive .
To him , craft beers have nothing to do with getting drunk .
They ’re all about flavor .
To prove his point , Carter has been known to offer lawmakers an illicit taste of a Yeti Russian Imperial Stout , with 9.5 % alcohol content .
“ It looks like used engine oil -- black , thick , sticky .
It will glue your lips to the glass , ” he says .
“ The first taste you get is the bitterness .
Then you taste coffee .
Then dark chocolate .
Then caramel , with a hint of plums or raisins .
The aftertaste is pancake syrup , ” Carter says .
“ You give it to these legislators and the look on their face is priceless . ”
Back at the home - brew club in Harvest , a suburb outside the northern Alabama city of Huntsville , Free the Hops members are talking about the first time they experienced such a revelation .
Advertisement
“ I was in San Francisco .
I was 25 years old , ” Tipton says , as he remembers the Anchor Steam that turned him on to the world of craft beers .
Swearingen steps forward , holding a shot glass half - full of a home - brew the color of Pepsi .
“ When I first moved here , to me a good beer was Miller Genuine Draft , ” he admits .
There ’s a chorus of groans .
“ I ’m sorry , ” Arnett says somberly .
Advertisement
“ Then I moved up to Sam Adams in college . . . " Swearingen says .
“ And finally ! ” Oberman interrupts .
Swearingen nods :
That was it for him .
A few Samuel Adams lagers , and he was hooked on the concept of drinking for taste .
“ I do n’t even like being drunk , ” Tipton says .
“ I just enjoy beer . ”
Advertisement
Some aficionados have beer cellars stocked with dozens of rare brews .
Others obsessively hunt down new flavors .
Oberman once paid $ 65 on EBay for a bottle of Thomas Hardy ale , vintage 1980 , which he shared with several friends .
The taste was not stupendous .
But the experience , he says , was ( almost ) worth the money .
As his basement grows steadily noisier , Oberman , 39 , slips out for a moment and makes his way to a large workshop .
One wall is covered with ribbons he ’s won from out - of - state home - brew competitions .
Barley , rye and other ingredients are packed into old kitty - litter tubs .
A simple beer takes Oberman about five hours to brew in a series of stainless steel kettles .
But he does n’t stick to simple these days .
In one corner of the workshop , Oberman has piled slabs of broken granite in preparation for a Steinbier , or “ stone brew , ” which involves tossing glowing - hot chunks of granite into the brewing wort to keep it boiling .
( The ancient process caramelizes the sugars and leads to a more robust flavor . )
Advertisement
Another of his experiments is fermenting in an enormous glass jug , covered by a T - shirt to protect it from the light .
It ’s a light - bodied , sharp - tasting beer known as a Flanders Red Ale , and Oberman has sprinkled wood chips from an old wine barrel into the brew .
They ’re loaded with bacteria that will eat up residual sugars , leaving a crisp , tart flavor .
Oberman plans to let the beer ferment at least a year before he cracks it open .
Perhaps by then it will be legal .

A day after a U.S. judge dinged TorrentSpy with one of the largest fines in copyright history , the lawyer for the torrent - tracking search engine said Thursday the $ 111 million judgment wo n't get paid .
Nevis - based Valence Media , the owner of TorrentSpy , filed for bankruptcy protection in England last week " and has no appreciable assets , " attorney Ira Rothken said .
" This was a Hollywood publicity stunt . "
The Motion Picture Association of America sued the search engine in Los Angeles federal court , alleging the site facilitated copyright infringement of Hollywood movies .
The MPAA won a default judgmentlast year after TorrentSpy refused to turn over internal documents , and a federal judge levied the $ 111 million penalty and ordered the site never to return online .
" It certainly is not a lesson for other search engines to look at what the rules are as they relate to dot - torrent files , " Rothken said .
" There was no analysis of the copyright . "
Elizabeth Kaltman , an MPAA spokeswoman , said " We will pursue enforcement of the judgment . "
The legality of torrent - tracking services has never been litigated on the merits in the United States , said Charles Baker , a Houston IP lawyer who defended Grokster and is Limewire 's attorney in a case accusing the peer - to - peer software maker of facilitating copyright infringement .
The MPAA , he said , wants " other torrent owners and operators to look at the $ 111 million figure and say , ' I 'm getting out of the business . ' "
The TorrentSpy case , Baker said , " is another example of the studios eating these guys to death .
They have n't tried the merits of the case . "
Gary Fung , the operator and founder of tracking service Isohunt , said the TorrentSpy decision worries him , but he 's not going to cave to Hollywood .
" I 'm worried , " he said .
" I would n't be able to pay something like a $ 100 million .
I fully know the risk I 'm taking . "
The United States ' largest copyright fine , $ 115 million , was against the Kazaa file sharing service two years ago .
The MPAA 's case against Fung is pending in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , a case that is likely to set legal precedent in the United States and perhaps abroad on the legalities of torrent - tracking services that the MPAA claims facilitate wanton copyright infringement .
The TorrentSpy penalty is being appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco , Rothken said .
He has already appealed last year 's default judgment in the case that allegedly was built on the back of a hacker who was paid $ 15,000 to obtain private e-mail and financial information .
Both sides are briefing that case .

Microsoft is renaming its existing embedded Windows operating systems and supplementing them with additional offerings in key device categories , the company announced Tuesday .
Windows XP Embedded will become Windows Embedded Standard , while Windows Embedded CE will be renamed Windows Embedded Compact .
Windows Embedded for Point of Service , meanwhile , will become Windows Embedded POSReady .
Windows Embedded Enterprise , meanwhile , will be an application - compatible embedded operating system that will gradually gain a broader set of embedded enabling features .
Today it is composed of Windows Vista and Windows XP for Embedded Systems , and is licensed exclusively for embedded device development .
Embedded operating systems typically are found in consumer electronics , traffic - control systems and medical equipment .
The company announced its rebranding plans at Embedded Systems Conference Silicon Valley 2008 in San Jose , Calif .
Intuitive Presentation
" Our aim is to present the evolving Windows Embedded product family in an intuitive fashion , making it easier for our customers to choose the right platforms and tools for their needs , " said Kevin Dallas , general manager of the Windows Embedded Business at Microsoft .
" Windows Embedded solutions for key device categories will energize our partner ecosystem by enabling new business scenarios and help lay the foundation for partners to successfully fulfill our vision of a new generation of smart , connected , service - oriented devices . "
The first renamed product will be Windows Embedded Standard , which will launch on June 3 .
Windows Embedded Compact and Windows Embedded POSReady will both ship in 2009 , until which time they will continue to be sold under their current names .
Microsoft 's new key device category solutions will be offered under the Windows Embedded Ready name and will ship as preconfigured toolkits , giving device manufacturers the market - specific features they need to build next - generation devices .
Further details will be released later this year , Microsoft said .
New Certification Program
Microsoft also announced on Tuesday the new Windows Embedded CE 6.0 Certification program , designed to provide a common reference point on the skills and technical expertise that Microsoft recommends for all Windows Embedded CE 6.0 developers .
It is the first such program for the Windows Embedded family .
The certification exam will be available on May 5 for US $ 125 through Prometric testing centers worldwide .
Linux Fears ?
As Linux increasingly gains ground in the embedded operating system arena , Microsoft 's rebranding has caused some speculation that the decision was a reaction to that encroachment .
" Certainly in the embedded space Microsoft is worried about Linux , " Greg DeMichillie , a lead analyst at Directions on Microsoft , told LinuxInsider .
" But there are lots of other explanations for why it might rebrand , " DeMichillie asserted .
" This is a way to take products without much in common and give them the same name to imply that they have more in common than they really do . "
Different Kernels
Windows XP Embedded and Windows Embedded CE are based on different kernels and are " pretty different operating systems , " he noted .
" This is really just an attempt to make Microsoft 's two main embedded offerings look like part of the same family .
It probably has more significance to the company than it will to consumers . "
Of course , the whole notion of having an XP Embedded comes out of Microsoft 's attempt to respond to Linux , DeMichillie pointed out .
" The big thing that did was let manufacturers take stuff out of the operating system that they did n't want in their device , and that was done to compete with Linux in the device space . "
The rebranding , however , is not so much a part of that competition , he said .
" A product family that scales from small to large sounds better than saying ' we have two different operating systems . "
' Just a Branding Issue '
Indeed , " clarity in branding is always a good thing in the market , and to me the rebranding seems to make sense , " Raven Zachary , research director for the open source practice at the 451 Group , told LinuxInsider .
" I 'd be hesitant to read too much into the Linux angle here , " he cautioned .
" Companies do this sort of thing -- it 's just part of aligning products for the market .
It 's not a considerable strategic shift , just a branding issue . "
Linux has definitely been growing in the embedded systems market , and " will compete more and more with proprietary embedded systems , " Zachary concluded .
" But I do n't think it 's a short - term concern for Microsoft in terms of how it brands its products . "

Via Think Progress , Mukasey turned on the waterworks in a speech this week in San Francisco .
The New York Sun reports that " Mukasey grimaced , swallowed hard , and seemed to tear up as he reflected on the weaknesses in America ’s anti-terrorism strategy prior to the 2001 attacks .
‘ We got three thousand .
...
We ’ve got three thousand people who went to work that day and did n’t come home to show for that , ’ he said , struggling to maintain his composure . "
Once again , it seems we have to remind Mukasey and all the other Republicans who insist on tying retroactive amnesty for phone companies who spied on Americans to September 11 that it was n't weaknesses in our intelligence that failed us on September 11 .
Throughout that summer , we now well know , Tenet , Richard Clarke , and several other officials were running around with their " hair on fire , " warning that al - Qaida was about to unleash a monumental attack .
On Aug. 6 , Bush was given the now - famous President 's Daily Brief ( by one of Tenet 's underlings ) , warning that this attack might take place " inside the United States . "
For the previous few years — as Philip Zelikow , the commission 's staff director , revealed this morning — the CIA had issued several warnings that terrorists might fly commercial airplanes into buildings or cities .
Well , at least not weaknesses in our intelligence system .
Just in the intelligence of the people receiving the information .
今週末の日曜日、NHKスペシャルでドバイをやるよ。
NHK スペシャル 沸騰都市 第 １ 回 ドバイ 砂漠にわき出た巨大マネ ー
世界最大の空港、世界最大の人工島、世界最大のショッピングセンター、世界一ぞろいのドバイの中でも極めつけが、地上160階以上高さ800メートルを超える、世界一高いビル「ブルジュドバイ」。世界中から労働者や建築資材をかき集め。４日に１階ずつのペースで上へ上へと伸び続け、2009年じゅうの慣性をめざしている。湯水のように流れ込んだオイルマネーは、砂漠の小都市だったドバイを富が唸る黄金の都市へと変えた。経済成長率は毎年20パーセント近い伸びを記録、証券取引所の時価総額は5年で12倍に膨らみ、不動産価格は20パーセント以上高騰している。山を削り、海を埋め立て、砂漠を切り開く。人類史上催促のスピードと最大のスケールで開発が進むドバイに、世界中からヒト、モノ、カネが吸い寄せられている。
一方ドバイの将来を危ぶむ声もあ る
。1800 万都市上海を遥かに上回る規模の開発が人口わずか120万のドバイで行われており、過剰開発、バブルが指摘され始めている。
アラビア半島の砂漠の中に突如出現した巨大都市ドバイ。世界中が不況に苦しむ中、異様な成長を遂げるドバイに群がる人々の欲望の物語を描く
NHK 広報局 報道資料より引 用
ポジティブ教のディスカバリーチャンネル、「光と影」教のNHK、煽りの民放、視聴者と役割がはっきりしてるよね。
消費者が内容や番組規範を予見できることは歌舞伎や能に同じく、当人にとって期待はずれの地雷を踏む確率が下がるという点で、番組の品質を構成する重要な要素だ。報道資料を見る限りでの判断だが、番組構成は既にNHKスペシャル的様式美として確立されたテンプレに沿うものだ。どの題材が選ばれて、どのような話の構成になるか大体想像できる。余計な番組に時間を潰さなくて済むし、当該分野に対する今まで知らなかったキーワードを知ることも多少は期待できる。
しかしそれは報道倫理綱領に似た神経毒で、放映できる内容や描き方に制約を設け、対象の論じ方を硬直させてしまう。そうなることは望まないが、例えば、ヒストリカルチャンネルの一部のようなフリーダムな立場での描き方はNHKスペシャルではひっくり返っても不可能な芸当だ。そもそも企画が通らないし、万が一通っても無数の校正を受ける内にごく標準的な番組になってしまう。
その点、海外の幾つかの番組の飛ばしっぷりをすこしうらやましく思う。すこしだけ。
There was only one problem , however .
My reader assumed this was an oil pipe , but I 've been burned enough times in making assumptions that I was taking nothing for granted .
The complicating factor , though , was that the magazine also failed to specify .
( In possession of the hard copy , my reader scanned the cover with ARMY 's description of the cover affixed to the lower - left corner . )
Because the magazine 's website was n't any more helpful , I did some image searches on oil pipelines .
I found several cross-sections that looked almost identical to the picture above , but I still was n't convinced .
My friends , I thought the latest cover of " ARMY " was interesting even before McCain suggested we went to war over oil .
( A reader sent this to me on Tuesday , and McCain put his foot in his mouth on Friday . )
Then , having expressed my initial reservations to my reader , he wrote back a day later with more information .
Being familiar with the DOD website , he had searched there and found the image .
Even more satisfying , however , was the accompanying caption .
Here 's the link , but if it ever goes dead in the future , here 's the caption that accompanied the same shot above :
Water Vital in Arid Iraq .
Pfc. Mike Skirkanion , from 1st Battalion , 27th Infantry Regiment , 2nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team , 25th Infantry Division , provides security at a water access point in the Taji Qada , Iraq .
Still , even with that cleared up , what I could n't help wondering was : how come " ARMY " -- given the photograph 's intense political loading -- left out any mention of what kind of pipe this was ?
I mean , was it possible their readership would automatically recognize this as one type , and not the other ?
Which brings me back to McCain .
Yesterday , in damage control mode , McEloquent tried to reframe his original statement to reflect that oil is just one of a multiplicity of factors that might justify U.S. military involvement in the Middle East .
To me , therein lies a good explanation for why the type of pipe might be left unmentioned .
Because , between guarding a water pipe and invading Iraq to protect our " crudest " needs , it certainly is the best ( neocon ) strategy to keep our most self - serving interests squarely on the table while leaving our intentions fundamentally ambiguous .

Researchers at Yale School of Medicine have developed a blood test with enough sensitivity and specificity to detect early stage ovarian cancer with 99 percent accuracy .
Results of this new study are published in the February 15 issue of the journal Clinical Cancer Research .
The results build on work done by the same
Yale group in 2005 showing 95 percent effectiveness of a blood test using four proteins .
“ The ability to recognize almost 100 percent of new tumors will have a major impact on the high death rates of this cancer , ” said Mor .
“ We hope this test will become the standard of care for women having routine examinations . ”
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer deaths in the United States and three times more lethal than breast cancer .
It is usually not diagnosed until its advanced stages and has come to be known as the “ silent killer . ”
This new phase II clinical trial led by Gil Mor , M.D. , associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics , Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences at Yale , included 500 patients ; 350 healthy controls and 150 ovarian cancer patients .
Mor and colleagues validated the previous research and used a new platform called multiplex technology to simplify the test into one single reaction using very small amounts of serum from the blood .
The new platform uses six protein biomarkers instead of four , increasing the specificity of the test from 95 to 99.4 percent .
The team looked for the presence of specific proteins and quantified the concentration of those proteins in the blood .
The Early Detection Research Network ( EDRN ) of the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) independently evaluated the results of the test .
“ This is the most sensitive and specific test currently available , ” said Mor .
“ Previous tests recognized 15 to 20 percent of new tumors .
Proteins from the tumors were the only biomarkers used to test for ovarian cancer .
That is okay when you have big masses of tumors , but it is not applicable in very early phases of the tumor .
Testing the proteins produced by the body in response to the presence of the tumor as well as the proteins the tumors produce , helped us to create a unique picture that can detect early ovarian cancer . ”
Mor and colleagues have begun a phase III evaluation in a multi-center clinical trial .
In collaboration with EDRN / NCI and Laboratories Corporation of America ( LabCorp ) , they are testing close to 2,000 patients .
The test is available at Yale through the Discovery to Cure program .
Yale has licensed the test to three companies : Lab Corp in the United States , Teva in Israel and SurExam in China .

FOR many Tibetans , the case for the historical independence of their land is unequivocal .
They assert that Tibet has always been and by rights now ought to be an independent country .
China ’s assertions are equally unequivocal : Tibet became a part of China during Mongol rule and its status as a part of China has never changed .
Both of these assertions are at odds with Tibet ’s history .
The Tibetan view holds that Tibet was never subject to foreign rule after it emerged in the mid-seventh century as a dynamic power holding sway over an Inner Asian empire .
These Tibetans say the appearance of subjugation to the Mongol rulers of the Yuan Dynasty in the 13th and 14th centuries , and to the Manchu rulers of China ’s Qing Dynasty from the 18th century until the 20th century , is due to a modern , largely Western misunderstanding of the personal relations among the Yuan and Qing emperors and the pre-eminent lamas of Tibet .
In this view , the lamas simply served as spiritual mentors to the emperors , with no compromise of Tibet ’s independent status .
In China ’s view , the Western misunderstandings are about the nature of China : Western critics do n’t understand that China has a history of thousands of years as a unified multinational state ; all of its nationalities are Chinese .
The Mongols , who entered China as conquerers , are claimed as Chinese , and their subjugation of Tibet is claimed as a Chinese subjugation .
Joel Madden and his girlfriend Nicole Richie will be parents by next week , according to the Good Charlotte star ’s older brother , Josh .
The heavily pregnant Simple Life star is expected to give birth “ sometime in the next week . ”
DJ Josh cannot wait saying , “ That ’s all we know .
We do n’t know what ( gender ) it is .
We do n’t know any names .
I ’m being completely honest , I swear ! ”
And Josh reveals that there was a double celebration over Christmas when his younger sister Sarah gave birth on December 20 , adding , “ Christmas was awesome .
Nicole could n’t fly , but we were all there . ”
On his present for his new niece or nephew , he revealed , “ I got them some ( baby ) clothes , that ’s what I ’m into .
We ’re very excited . ”
The Madden family had a big Christmas celebration but Nicole Richie was not able to attend because she has been restricted from flying in the late stages of her pregnancy .
The uncles are all proud and anxious to welcome another niece or nephew to the family .

There 's a lot of divide and conquer in the works .
It seems like Hillary Clinton does n't have much chance for the nomination .
If so , then why does she seem to be trying to sabotage the Democratic Party 's chances to retake the White House ?
If McCain " wins " in November , Hillary will be the new Ralph Nader , the new spoiler .
If she would just go away , or if she could at least stop attacking Obama so much , then perhaps the suspicions towards her would n't be escalating .
Jeff Wells of the Rigorous Intuition has been " tombstoned " from the Democratic Underground for voting racist in a poll .
He has been posting as " Minstrel Boy " for a number of years .

“ What have I learned along the way ? ” I asked rhetorically .
“ That corporate media 's handling of the news has become increasingly unreliable over the years .
In fact , mainstream journalists find it difficult , if not dangerous , to cover stories that do not fit neatly into what is known as the Washington Consensus .
Meanwhile , corporations have developed sophisticated strategies to promote the stories they want to see , and prevent others from being aired or published .
The result is perception management , a highly effective form of social engineering . ”

There simply is no way around the bane of political correctness .
Whether conservative or liberal or something else , the idea that we everyone who is a ( insert group ) has to think and speak a certain way has become epidemic .
What is said on the air counts most .
If I had to work for someone else I 'd be out of a job .
I am incorrect for everyone .

Air America 's Randy Rhodes Suspended : We Did It !
This was posted by Susan .
I am assuming that 's Johnson 's wife .
Johnson is ex-CIA , if that is possible .
Do you remember the video we posted on April 1 — in which Randi Rhodes called both Geraldine Ferraro and Hillary Clinton “ whores ” ?
The YouTube that our video whiz C.S. created from an ordinarily non-transferrable source , and posted at YouTube ?

Suspending Rhodes has gotten a lot of attention for Air America , which may lead more people to listen .
And what does the Constitution have to do with it ?
The First Amendment prohibits government from restricting free speech ... it does n't say anything about business .

If Randi leaves Air America it would be a much better business decision to join the Jones Meadia network .
JMA is much better funded , established and successful .
JMA is in the financial position to offer Randi a lot more money and get her heard on a lot more radio stations than NovaM.
JMA already signed up The Ed Schultz Show , The Stephanie Miller Show , NASCAR / Motor Racing Network , The Kim Komando Show , Associated Press , Clark Howard and Neal Boortz .

The fact that this occurred during a stand - up act which was totally un-related to the talk radio show is extremely important - more than most people realize .
The elite just lifted their skirt and showed us all what time it really is and / or going to be shortly .
What Randi said about Clinton and Ferraro is completely true - regardless of how tacky and mean spirited is may be played in the media spin cycle the fact is the truth these days especially surrounding those " whXres " is ugly and mean .
I for one think that Randi finally just came out and said it .
Sadly as Clinton lied - Randi is running for cover due to sniper fire ... and there is no reception with a little girl reciting poetry honoring her arrival ... but there should be !
Great Blog btw !

I heard on a rerun of the the Bill Press show that the suspension of Randi is indefinite .
In that case I have to rethink my patronizing of aar .

Perhaps Randi left out a few big Whores . . .

Malloy is most likely correct .
It 's obvious now that AAR intends to become ( or has become ) the DLC voice on the Radio .
The DLC being in reality a group of dishonest moderate republicans and NOT Democrats in the traditional sense of the term .
AAR is flushing itself down the elite Big money trans-national corporate toilet .
I would be surprised if Randi stands for this and returns .
If she does - it will be due to legal and contractual issues and only last until those legal obligations are complete .
Then she 's outta there .
Unless there is another change in the ruling elite at AAR but I 'm not holding my breath .
In the meantime ( after THIS ) will she put her full enormous energies into it ?
Maybe .
So that leaves us Rachel Maddow , Thom Hartmann , Seder ( Sundays ) and Ring of Fire .
You can have the rest .
Rachel : as soon as she lands her MSNBC show she appears to be trying out for - she 's outta there .
Thom Hartmann ( my personal favorite ) :
Thom is highly principled American - more so that it would appear the puppet masters at AAR could possibly be .
He 's one of the most intelligent people in radio .
So far he has said nothing about the Randi situation as far as I know and I listen almost daily .
I was listening to Hartmann for a year or more from Vermont before he joined AAR - we 'll see .
In any case I 'll find him on the stream where ever he is .
Ring of Fire :
Two lawyers - they should know .
Let 's see what they have to say about this - if anything , and where they stand .
It 's sad but we still have NovaM and a couple of others .
At least these folks have other options .

I am a fan of Randi Rhodes and an Obama supporter .
I also work in broadcasting myself and know that we have to be very careful what we say in public .
In today 's You Tube environment especially , nothing happens in a vaccuum .
If the company thinks that there could be an adverse affect on advertising that is the ONLY time they spring into action .
Had Rhodes said this about Ann Coulter , nothing would have happened , You Tube or not .
However , she offended one - half of the network 's listenrship .
You think there was n't gonna be advertiser fall out once this got 0on You Tube ?
One thing that is getting lost here .... this incident has just made passionate Obama and Clinton supporters hate each other even more .
Instead of focusing on John McCain and his insane statements on Iraq , we 're discussing just how highly Geraldine Ferraro ( who is indeed , a bit clueless ) rates on the bitch meter .
And she is exploiting every minute of it .
Meanwhile , all this is doing is help to send John McCain to the White House .
When are we going to focus on the true enemy ?
Or do Dems really have a death wish ?
WHile we are busy eating our own , McCain and Bush are getting away with murder .

Dennis asked : what does the Constitution have to do with it ?
The First Amendment prohibits government from restricting free speech ... it does n't say anything about business .
That 's right .
And if she 's at work , and they wish to fire / suspend her for something she 's said on air ( where their license to broadcast could be effected ) they 'd have every right to suspend her .
She was not on the air , however .
On the other hand , she was making an appearance to help promote the show in San Francisco ( for Green960 ) .
I doubt that AAR paid her for that promotional appearance , but it could be used to say she was repping the company and thus , should n't be saying such things .
On the other hand , if the company stands for restoring the constitution and the values that it represents , it 's incredibly bad form to take down one of their owns for exercising those values in what was clearly a stand - up comedy routine ( go look at the video ) .

phred42 ~ I agree Progressive voices should not & must not be relegated to a free speech zone in the media .
" Progressive views must make it to MSM " but until then ; Satellite radio can be purchased for 13.00 or less month and as little as $ 20.00 for a radio .
This was the best investment I made in the past 2 terms ... for sanity , entertainment & uninterrupted progressive talk ... not mention Lynn Samuels . . . scootmandubious ~

On satellite ...
I think that merging the technologies and delivery mechanism portion of those companies makes a lot of sense .
Two sets of hardware that are incompatible , with shifting content , etc. make it very hard for the average listener to want to invest in it .
On the other hand , I 'd like to see the FCC keep the content portions of these companies separate so that we can have multiple companies competing for " air space " on the merged and more " common carrier " oriented satellite distribution engine company .
Such a merged company would be a good thing .
If we kept those two content arms apart , then you'd be more apt to hear more progressive voices on two channels .
If you merge those arms as well , then most likely the merged entity will use that as an excuse to put them on only one channel and chop about half of the content .
A merged set of the content arms of these companies is consolidating the media more and is a BAD thing !
As for Thom Hartmann with AAR , he 's about the only thing left there that interests me now .
And it seems like AAR is now playing games with him too now , discontinuing what used to be his free daily podcast fee ( with ads in it ) just a few weeks ago .
Perhaps they realize that many folks like me were just grabbing those podcasts and listening to them instead of subscribing to Air America .
And hopefully at some point Sirius realizes that they would get better bang for their buck to update their contract with Thom to have him on for his full three hours in the morning instead of Lyn Samuels .
Sorry , but Lynn Samuels does n't do it for me .
And she 's probably treated Obama just as badly as Randi has Clinton .
She certainly allows a lot more profanity on her satellite only channel .

Randi Rhodes is a shrill Obama shill who needs to crawl back under her rock and stay there .
I quit listening to Air Obama months ago when it became very apparent that being liberal meant supporting Obama and excoriating Clinton .
No voices of dissent wanted or needed .
If Obama supporters are so clueless and tasteless that they think some media sow like Rhodes should be able to call two top female Democrats " Whores " while at a radio event for her employers then they have drunk waaaaaaaay too much of the kool aid .
And the Constitution has nothing to do with her suspension , unless I missed the part where the government was involved in some way .
Contractual issues are between Trashy Rhodes and her employer .
The air waves are a little less poluted with her voice gone for a time .
Doubtless the publics neverending appetite for trash , from Limbaugh to Rhodes and every where in between will find her a spot to coninue her tasteless rants .

5 Principles for Guarding Maiden Chastity
Chinese people , in general , put a lot of faith into catchy , bold , and sometimes prudently whimsical motto’s , proverbs , and slogans .
Basically if Confucius has said it , they have memorized it to heart .
Women in particular , have for centuries been subjected to detailed regulation on their moral values , from how they dress , eat , walk , talk to acting emotions according to different occasions .
Chinese authorities however , with the growth of new social norms , realized in order for women to speak and act properly in this new generation , they must come up with new slogans to sustain their tradition of proper manner and behavior .
The result is a 5 step guide , instructing modern teenage girls what to do when caught in a mental or moral dilemma of giving away their virginity .
Five Principles for Guarding Maiden Chastity
1 . When being harassed by strangers , one must reprove in harsh tones .
Ambiguous response or borderline behaviors are forbidden .
2 . When one ’s boyfriend tries to break through the last ditch , one must not convey any pleasurable facial expression and the legs must draw tightly close together .
3 . When having questions concerning the physiology of the opposite sex , one should look it up in books .
One must not wander around late night looking for exposed males .
4 . When attending good friends / classmates ’ wedding , one should bless the couple whole - heartily .
One must not coquettishly wink at the bridegroom or sending flirtatious signals to the best man .
5 . If unfortunately one loses her virginity , one must not look as if being blessed with a rebirth or show any gratification on one ’s face .
We have never felt a mass book burning was more in order , than after reading this book .

KATHMANDU ( Reuters ) - Nepal ’s Maoist former rebels took a shock early lead on Saturday in an election aimed at cementing a peace deal that ended a decade - long civil war .
Maoist leader Prachanda is garlanded by his comrade Matrika Yadav ( top ) while his second - in - command Baburam Bhattarai ( R ) and Pampha Bhusal ( L ) look on after being declared winners in the election in Kathmandu April 12 , 2008 .

Early tallies from Thursday ’s vote show the Maoists lead in 65 out of 122 constituencies where counting has begun .
They have also won 23 out of the 33 constituencies where results have been declared , election officials said .
The Maoists say they are committed to democracy but are still classified as a terrorist organization by the United States .
“ This is the people ’s victory , ” hundreds chanted outside a counting centre in Kathmandu , many with the hammer and sickle painted on their faces or with Maoist flags wrapped around their heads .
Final results of the election , Nepal ’s first in nine years , could take around 10 days and are almost certain to lead to a coalition government , analysts say .
An elected 601 - member special assembly is supposed to write a new constitution and usher in a republic in the impoverished Himalayan state , ending a 240 - year - old Hindu monarchy .
Maoists ’ leader Prachanda , whose nom de guerre means fierce in Nepali , won a landslide victory in his constituency .
He emerged from a counting centre with his forehead smeared with vermilion and his head swathed in layers of marigold garlands .
“ We will create a stronger basis for sustainable peace ... economic development and a federal republic by including all sections and communities of people .
“ We will establish greater national unity with all political parties after the election , ” he said , in a statement signaling his commitment to a coalition government , analysts said .
Slideshow ( 13 images )
Kunda Dixit , editor of the weekly Nepali Times , said : “ At the rate it is going , the Maoists will be the number one party .
“ Trends so far suggest that there was an overwhelming desire on the part of mostly young voters for change , peace and development . ”
There are 240 seats decided on a first - past - the - post basis , with another 335 seats decided by proportional representation and 26 to be nominated by the cabinet .
MAOIST PRAGMATISTS
Few results are in from the southern plains , home to nearly half of the population , and Maoists are thought to have weaker support there .
The complex system also means the former guerrillas are very unlikely to get a majority .
“ The trends do n’t reflect how they would do in the proportional elections , ” said a Western diplomat .
A Maoist victory would be hard to stomach for Nepal ’s conservative army , traditionally loyal to the king , as well as for the governments of the United States and India .
New Delhi worries it could encourage India ’s own Maoist rebels .
Prachanda , who wants to be Nepal ’s first president , insists he wants friendly ties with Washington , New Delhi and Beijing .
“ We will have good relations with all countries , including India and China , ” he said .
These days his movement shies away from the language of Marx and Mao , proposing public - private partnerships but not nationalization , advocating land reform and social justice but accepting globalization is a fact of life .
Maoist ministers already serve in Nepal ’s coalition government , set up after a 2006 peace deal .
Several diplomats said they had shown themselves to be pragmatists .
The election , and the abolition of the monarchy , had been the main demands of the Maoists during their long insurgency in which more than 13,000 people died .
The Maoists ’ strong showing was regarded as a vote against mainstream political parties , blamed for rampant corruption and endless squabbling in the past , analysts said .

SOUNDING more like a cartographer than a central banker , Ben Bernanke this week showed off the Federal Reserve 's latest gizmo for tracking America 's property bust : a series of maps that colour - code price declines , foreclosures and other gauges of housing distress for every county in the country .
The Fed chairman 's goal was to show graphically that falling prices meant more foreclosures , and he went on to urge lenders to write down the principal on troubled loans where the house is worth less than the value of the mortgage .
But the jazzy design of his maps — where hotter colours imply more trouble — also makes a starker point .
The pain of America 's housing bust varies enormously by region .
Hardest hit have been the “ bubble states ” — California , Nevada and Florida , as well as parts of the industrial Midwest .
The biggest uncertainty hanging over the economy is how red will things get .
The answer is not simple .
For a start , it is hard to be sure just how much house prices have fallen .
America has several house - price indices and they tell different stories .
Widely cited , but least useful , are monthly figures showing median home prices produced by the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) .
These indicate that median prices are down some 13 % from their peak , but since these averages do not adjust for the mix of homes changing hands , which fluctuates from month to month , they are inevitably distorted .
Mr Bernanke 's maps use figures from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) .
Its statistics have broad geographic reach and track repeat sales of the same house .
The monthly national index suggests average prices have fallen only 3 % from a peak in April 2007 , and the quarterly figures are still positive ( see left - hand chart ) .
But OFHEO 's figures include only houses financed by mortgages backed by the government - sponsored giants , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
By excluding subprime and jumbo loans , they leave out the top and bottom of the market — where prices rose fastest during the bubble and where the mortgage mess was most severe .
Thus OFHEO 's figures probably understate the scale of the housing mess , particularly in states such as California and Florida .
Another set of indices , developed by Robert Shiller and Karl Case and produced by Standard & Poor 's ( S&P ) , a rating agency , includes all types of houses and , not surprisingly , show house prices rising faster during the boom and falling faster now .
As of the fourth quarter of 2007 , the S&P / Case - Shiller national index was down 10 % from its peak , and an index of ten large cities had fallen by almost 16 % by February .
Although the Case - Shiller figures are not perfect — they miss many rural areas — they are a better gauge of price declines in big cities .
Assessing how much further house prices are likely to fall gets even trickier .
One route is to look at market expectations : investors expect a further 20 % drop , judging by the prices of futures contracts linked to the Case - Shiller 10 city index .
But the futures market is small and illiquid and may overstate the possible declines .
The discrepancy between supply and demand suggests that prices could fall a lot more .
By historical standards there is a huge glut of unsold homes on the market .
The homeowner - vacancy rate — which includes all vacant homes for sale — has soared to a record level of 2.9 % , which means that there are some 1.1 m “ excess ” houses for sale compared with the average between 1985 and 2005 .
Although the inventory of new homes is falling as builders have slashed their production , the supply of homes for sale is being pushed up by foreclosures even as demand from new homeowners remains weak .
By most measures , prices are still above the levels implied by the fundamentals .
Using a model that ties house prices to disposable incomes and long - term interest rates , analysts at Goldman Sachs reckon that the correction in national house prices is only halfway through .
They expect an 18 - 20 % correction overall , or another 11 - 13 % decline from today 's levels .
But their models suggest that six states — Arizona , Florida , Virginia , Maryland , California and New Jersey , could see further price declines of 25 % or more .
Optimists dispute this gloomy assessment , pointing out that some measures of housing affordability have dramatically improved .
According to NAR figures , monthly payments on a typical house with a 30 - year mortgage and 20 % downpayment were 18.5 % of the median family 's income in February , down from almost 26 % at the peak — and close to the historical average .
But this measure of affordability is misleading , not least because credit standards have tightened so much .
The latest survey of loan officers conducted by the Fed suggested on May 5th that 60 % of banks tightened their lending standards for prime mortgages in the first three months of 2007 .
And , as Michael Feroli of JPMorgan points out , the affordability gauge depends on what measure of home prices you look at .
Use the Case - Shiller index , where the affordability of housing worsened sharply during the boom , and mortgage payments are still high in relation to incomes .
The right - hand chart shows a better measure of housing fundamentals — the relationship between house prices and rents .
This is a sort of price / earnings ratio for the housing market : the price of a house reflects the discounted value of future ownership , either as rental income or as rent saved by an owner who lives in the house .
A recent analysis by Morris Davis of the University of Wisconsin - Madison , and Andreas Lehnert and Robert Martin of the Fed , shows that the rent / price yield in America ranged between 5 % and 5.5 % from 1960 to 1995 , but fell rapidly thereafter to reach a historic low of 3.5 % at the height of the boom .
Given the typical pace of rental growth , Mr Feroli reckons house prices ( as measured by the Case - Shiller index ) need to fall by 10 - 15 % over the next year and a half for the rent / price yield to return to its historical average .
Again , that suggests the national housing bust is only halfway through .
And , given the scale of excess supply , house prices — particularly in hard hit areas — are likely to overshoot .
All told , Mr Bernanke 's maps are going to get a lot redder — and the pressure on policymakers to help struggling homeowners is bound to increase .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert admitted on Thursday that he took cash from an American businessman but refused to resign over a police investigation into hundreds of thousands of dollars of alleged bribes .

As Israelis enjoyed festivities marking Independence Day and the 60th anniversary of the founding of their state , police lifted a week - old media gag order and announced details of accusations that sparked calls for Olmert to quit .
Whether he does or not , doubt over his future is likely to upset his faltering , U.S. - sponsored peace negotiations with the Palestinians and will cast a heavy cloud over next week ’s celebratory visit to Israel by U.S. President George W. Bush .
The White House said Bush still intended to make the trip .
Olmert , in a late - night , televised address to the nation , said : “ I look each and every one of you in the eye and say , ‘ I never took bribes .
I never took a penny for myself ’. ”
With Olmert ’s allies complaining of a campaign to wreck the peace process , it was unclear if his fragile coalition would rally behind a man who last year said he was “ indestructible ” .
Israelis are no strangers to tales of corruption at the top in the Middle East ’s most feted democracy .
Olmert has weathered a string of investigations since he succeeded the ailing Ariel Sharon as prime minister in 2006 .
Sharon ’s son is in jail at the moment for campaign funding misdeeds on his father ’s behalf .
On Thursday , Olmert said all the cash he received -- put at hundreds of thousands of dollars by one judicial source -- was legitimate support from New York financier Morris Talansky to fund various election campaigns over nearly a decade from 1993 .
“ I was elected by you , the citizens of Israel , to be prime minister .
I do not intend to shrug off this responsibility , ” he said .
“ However , although not required by law , if the attorney general decides to file an indictment against me I will resign . ”
Olmert , 62 , said he did not believe the attorney general , with whom he has long been at daggers drawn , would follow through and indict him on the latest accusations .
CAMPAIGN FUNDS
In a terse six - minute address , Olmert said Talansky funded his two successful campaigns for mayor of Jerusalem in 1993 and 1998 , an unsuccessful bid to lead the right - wing Likud party in 1999 and a further internal Likud election in 2002 .
He also said the American “ helped me cover deficits ” after elections .
Just minutes earlier , police said in a statement : “ The investigation deals with suspicions that the prime minister received significant sums of money from a foreigner or number of foreign individuals over an extended period of time . ”
A police spokesman named Talansky as a key witness , along with Olmert ’s long - time secretary Shula Zaken , who has been under house arrest , and his former law partner Uri Messer .
One police source said investigators cracked coded notes kept by Zaken that they suspect recorded sums given by Talansky -- referred to in some of the notes as “ The Laundry Man ” .
Palestinian negotiators fear a collapse of the Olmert coalition will scupper hopes for a deal on a Palestinian state before Bush leaves office in January .
If Olmert did step down , however , he could be succeeded by his deputy in the centrist Kadima party , Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , who has been working closely with Washington and Palestinian negotiators on the peace process .
One lawmaker from Kadima , founded by Sharon and Olmert when they left Likud , said she was “ uncomfortable ” about the story of money for the party leader .
But Ronit Tirosh added that she thought Olmert was capable of continuing to lead the country .
But Gideon Sahar , an ally of Likud chief Benjamin Netanyahu , said : “ Olmert is unworthy and cannot carry on in his post .
The Kadima government is sunk up to its neck in corruption . ”
There was no immediate comment from Livni or from Defence Minister Ehud Barak , leader of Olmert ’s main coalition partner the Labour party .
Barak is under pressure from some Labour members to bolt the alliance , but others in the party fear that would trigger an election which Netanyahu could win with ease .
Talansky said in Jerusalem that he had given evidence to police after he came to Israel last month to visit relatives for the Passover holiday : “ I never was involved in politics , ” he said , smiling and joking with Israeli reporters .
“ Everything is OK .
I do n’t understand what ’s the big thing . ”
Official documents show that Talansky was treasurer of a charity , the New Jerusalem Foundation , which Olmert set up in 1999 .
U.S. tax records show that this institution declared more than $ 855,000 in donations from 1999 to 2002 .
This article was originally written in 2008 , but we created a cool video to go along with it yesterday
Let ’s find out why Pluto is no longer considered a planet .
Pluto was first discovered in 1930 by Clyde W. Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff Arizona .
Astronomers had long predicted that there would be a ninth planet in the Solar System , which they called Planet X . Only 22 at the time , Tombaugh was given the laborious task of comparing photographic plates .
These were two images of a region of the sky , taken two weeks apart .
Any moving object , like an asteroid , comet or planet , would appear to jump from one photograph to the next .
After a year of observations , Tombaugh finally discovered an object in the right orbit , and declared that he had discovered Planet X .
Because they had discovered it , the Lowell team were allowed to name it .
They settled on Pluto , a name suggested by an 11 - year old school girl in Oxford , England ( no , it was n’t named after the Disney character , but the Roman god of the underworld ) .
The Solar System now had 9 planets .
Astronomers were n’t sure about Pluto ’s mass until the discovery of its largest Moon , Charon , in 1978 .
And by knowing its mass ( 0.0021 Earths ) , they could more accurately gauge its size .
The most accurate measurement currently gives the size of Pluto at 2,400 km ( 1,500 miles ) across .
Although this is small , Mercury is only 4,880 km ( 3,032 miles ) across .
Pluto is tiny , but it was considered larger than anything else past the orbit of Neptune .
Over the last few decades , powerful new ground and space - based observatories have completely changed previous understanding of the outer Solar System .
Instead of being the only planet in its region , like the rest of the Solar System , Pluto and its moons are now known to be just a large example of a collection of objects called the Kuiper Belt .
This region extends from the orbit of Neptune out to 55 astronomical units ( 55 times the distance of the Earth to the Sun ) .
Astronomers estimate that there are at least 70,000 icy objects , with the same composition as Pluto , that measure 100 km across or more in the Kuiper Belt .
And according to the new rules , Pluto is not a planet .
It ’s just another Kuiper Belt object .
Here ’s the problem .
Astronomers had been turning up larger and larger objects in the Kuiper Belt .
2005 FY9 , discovered by Caltech astronomer Mike Brown and his team is only a little smaller than Pluto .
And there are several other Kuiper Belt objects in that same classification .
Astronomers realized that it was only a matter of time before an object larger than Pluto was discovered in the Kuiper Belt .
And in 2005 , Mike Brown and his team dropped the bombshell .
They had discovered an object , further out than the orbit of Pluto that was probably the same size , or even larger .
Officially named 2003 UB313 , the object was later designated as Eris .
Since its discovery , astronomers have determined that Eris ’ size is approximately 2,600 km ( 1,600 miles ) across .
It also has approximately 25 % more mass than Pluto .
With Eris being larger , made of the same ice / rock mixture , and more massive than Pluto , the concept that we have nine planets in the Solar System began to fall apart .
What is Eris , planet or Kuiper Belt Object ; what is Pluto , for that matter ?
Astronomers decided they would make a final decision about the definition of a planet at the XXVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union , which was held from August 14 to August 25 , 2006 in Prague , Czech Republic .
Astronomers from the association were given the opportunity to vote on the definition of planets .
One version of the definition would have actually boosted the number of planets to 12 ; Pluto was still a planet , and so were Eris and even Ceres , which had been thought of as the largest asteroid .
A different proposal kept the total at 9 , defining the planets as just the familiar ones we know without any scientific rationale , and a third would drop the number of planets down to 8 , and Pluto would be out of the planet club .
But , then … what is Pluto ?
In the end , astronomers voted for the controversial decision of demoting Pluto ( and Eris ) down to the newly created classification of “ dwarf planet ” .
Is Pluto a planet ?
Does it qualify ?
For an object to be a planet , it needs to meet these three requirements defined by the IAU :
It needs to be in orbit around the Sun – Yes , so maybe Pluto is a planet .
– Yes , so maybe Pluto is a planet .
It needs to have enough gravity to pull itself into a spherical shape – Pluto…check
– Pluto…check
It needs to have “ cleared the neighborhood ” of its orbit – Uh oh .
Here ’s the rule breaker .
According to this , Pluto is not a planet .
What does “ cleared its neighborhood ” mean ?
As planets form , they become the dominant gravitational body in their orbit in the Solar System .
As they interact with other , smaller objects , they either consume them , or sling them away with their gravity .
Pluto is only 0.07 times the mass of the other objects in its orbit .
The Earth , in comparison , has 1.7 million times the mass of the other objects in its orbit .
Any object that does n’t meet this 3rd criteria is considered a dwarf planet .
And so , Pluto is a dwarf planet .
There are still many objects with similar size and mass to Pluto jostling around in its orbit .
And until Pluto crashes into many of them and gains mass , it will remain a dwarf planet .
Eris suffers from the same problem .
It ’s not impossible to imagine a future , though , where astronomers discover a large enough object in the distant Solar System that could qualify for planethood status .
Then our Solar System would have 9 planets again .
Even though Pluto is a dwarf planet , and no longer officially a planet , it ’ll still be a fascinating target for study .
And that ’s why NASA has sent their New Horizons spacecraft off to visit it .
New Horizons will reach Pluto in July 2015 , and capture the first close - up images of the ( dwarf ) planet ’s surface .
Space enthusiasts will marvel at the beauty and remoteness of Pluto , and the painful deplaneting memories will fade .
We ’ll just be able to appreciate it as Pluto , and not worry how to categorize it .
At least now you know why Pluto was demoted .
If you ’d like more information about Pluto , we did two podcasts on this topic at Astronomy Cast .
The first discusses the IAU ’s decision , and the second is about Pluto and the Icy Outer Solar System .
Check them out .

Eye in the Sky
S everal recent newsbits caught your Demon 's attention this past week , and before we all yawn and go back to worrying about other things , I 'd like to take the opportunity to reflect upon the damage wrought by Bushco on our civil liberties here at home in the name of " fighting terrorism . "
T his past Saturday Bushco sprang on Congress the news that it 's pushing ahead with a new domestic spying program ~ a " National Operations Application " office that has to do with satellite technology .
This despite the fact that Congress thought it had determined to hold the program in abeyance .
Bushco apparently got around the inconvenience posed by the recalcitrance of a co-equal Constitutional governmental body by classifying the program 's funding sources and its size .
Voila !
It 's invisible to us all !
Likewise , nobody knows what legal vetting the program has undergone ( if any ~given Bushco 's track record so far in legal matters where civil liberties and human rights are concerned , your Demon is inclined , with good reason , to speculate that it's the same BushState version of " l'etat , c'est moi " school of imperial " make it happen " legal reasoning that also produced the infamous John Yoo - David Addington " torture is not torture until organ failure or death " memos , now disavowed , we 're led to believe . )
" The Bush administration said yesterday that it plans to start using the nation 's most advanced spy technology for domestic purposes soon , rebuffing challenges by House Democrats over the idea 's legal authority .
" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said his department will activate his department 's new domestic satellite surveillance office in stages , starting as soon as possible with traditional scientific and homeland security activities -- such as tracking hurricane damage , monitoring climate change and creating terrain maps .
" Sophisticated overhead sensor data will be used for law enforcement once privacy and civil rights concerns are resolved , he said .
The department has previously said the program will not intercept communications .
' I think we 've fully addressed anybody 's concerns ' Chertoff added in remarks last week to bloggers .
' I think the way is now clear to stand it up and go warm on it . '
" ' There is no basis to suggest that this process is in any way insufficient to protect the privacy and civil liberties of Americans , ' Chertoff wrote [ the Chairs ] of the House Homeland Security Committee and its intelligence subcommittee , respectively , in letters released yesterday .
' I think we 've fully addressed anybody 's concerns '
Chertoff added in remarks last week to bloggers .
' I think the way is now clear to stand it up and go warm on it . '
" His statements marked a fresh determination to operate the department 's new National Applications Office as part of its counterterrorism efforts .
The administration in May 2007 gave DHS authority to coordinate requests for satellite imagery , radar , electronic - signal information , chemical detection and other monitoring capabilities that have been used for decades within U.S. borders for mapping and disaster response .
" But Congress delayed launch of the new office last October .
Critics cited its potential to expand the role of military assets in domestic law enforcement , to turn new or as - yet - undeveloped technologies against Americans without adequate public debate , and to divert the existing civilian and scientific focus of some satellite work to security uses .
" Democrats say Chertoff has not spelled out what federal laws govern the NAO , whose funding and size are classified .
Congress barred Homeland Security from funding the office until its investigators could review the office 's operating procedures and safeguards .
The department submitted answers on Thursday , but some lawmakers promptly said the response was inadequate .
" 'I have had a firsthand experience with the trust - me theory of law from this administration , ' said Harman , citing the 2005 disclosure of the National Security Agency 's domestic spying program , which included warrantless eavesdropping on calls and e-mails between people in the United States and overseas .
' I wo n't make the same mistake .
. . .
I want to see the legal underpinnings for the whole program . '
" [ Congressman ]
Thompson called DHS 's release Thursday of the office 's procedures and a civil liberties impact assessment ' a good start . '
But , he said , ' We still do n't know whether the NAO will pass constitutional muster since no legal framework has been provided . '
" DHS officials said the demands are unwarranted .
' The legal framework that governs the National Applications Office . . . is reflected in the Constitution , the U.S. Code and all other U.S. laws , ' said DHS spokeswoman Laura Keehner .
She said its operations will be subject to ' robust , ' structured legal scrutiny by multiple agencies . "
A nd if you believe that , or the fact that the spying / monitoring will be limited to innocuous civil warning sytems applications to which nobody can really object , I have a bridge for sale .
See me later .
I suspect that what they 're really talking about here , though the WaPo does n't come out and say it , is domestic spying via MILITARY satellite , anytime , anywhere , and fuck quaint old - fashioned notions such as " probable cause . "
It 's a brave new BushWorld we live in now .
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again ~ 911 is the best thing that ever happened to the disingenuous warmongering neocons ~ it has made their careers and provided the perfect cover to revive and relive some of this nation 's sorriest historical moments since J. Edgar Hoover 's most paranoid fantasies of Commie infiltration and nationwide panic .
Bushco exploited a nation 's legitimate fears to subvert the authority we surrendered ~ and now we can't seem to get it back .
We were led to believe that internal spying could only be for our own good , and reassured us all that our civil liberties would remain inviolate and intact .
Nixonian Revival ~ Spying on Domestic " Enemies "
In 2004 Salon ran an article titled , " Outlawing Dissent , " documenting the resurrection of domestic spying on peaceful anti-war dissidents , and the FBI 's use of local undercover cops to infiltrate and , on some occasions , try to provoke group members into acting in a way that could have resulted in violence .
The article handily recaps some history that bears remarking :
" In the early 1970s , after the exposure of COINTELPRO , a program of widespread FBI surveillance and sabotage of political dissidents , reforms were put in place to prevent the government from spying on political groups when there was no suspicion of criminal activity .
But once again , protesters throughout America are being watched , often by police who are supposed to be investigating terrorism .
Civil disobedience , seen during peaceful times as the honorable legacy of heroes like Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. , is being treated as terrorism 's cousin , and the government claims to be justified in infiltrating any meeting where it 's even discussed .
It 's too early to tell if America is entering a repeat of the COINTELPRO era .
But Jeffrey Fogel , legal director of the Center for Constitutional Law in Manhattan , says , ' There are certainly enough warning signs out there that we may be . '
[...]
" COINTELPRO 's abuses came to light in 1971 , when a group of activists calling themselves the Citizens Commission to Investigate the FBI broke into an FBI office in Media , Penn. , and stole several hundred pages of files .
" In his recent history of COINTELPRO , ' There 's Something Happening Here : The New Left , the Klan and FBI Counterintelligence , ' David Cunningham writes , ' These files provided the first public disclosure of a range of Bureau activities against targets such as the Black Panther Party , the Venceremos Brigade , the Philadelphia Labor Committee , Students for a Democratic Society , and college students with ' revolutionary ' leanings . '
" Eventually , damaging revelations about COINTELPRO led the FBI to adopt reforms designed to prevent a repeat of Hoover 's excesses .
Attorney General Edward Levi laid out a set of standards for FBI domestic surveillance .
' These so - called Levi Guidelines clearly laid out the criteria required for initiated investigations , establishing a standard of suspected criminal conduct , meaning activity ( rather than merely ideas or writings , which had been adequate cause for targeting groups and individuals as subversive during the COINTELPRO era ) , ' Cunningham writes .
' The guidelines also stipulated as acceptable only particular investigative techniques , making it considerably more difficult to initiate intrusive forms of surveillance . '
" The Levi guidelines did n't end all political spying -- in the 1980s , the FBI targeted the Committee in Solidarity With the People of El Salvador , or CISPES .
As the ACLU reports , ' Strong evidence suggests that CISPES was targeted for investigation because of its ideological opposition to then - President Reagan 's already controversial foreign policy in Latin America .
The FBI persisted in an intensive six - month investigation of CISPES in which it often reported the group 's activities to the Department of Justice in a prejudicial and biased manner . '
Yet most civil libertarians believe that even if the rules were occasionally broken , they still worked to protect First Amendment rights .
" Contrary to the claims made by defenders of Bush administration policies , the Levi guidelines would not have impeded an investigation of al - Qaida .
As Cunningham points out , cases ' with suspected ties to ' foreign powers ' were not subject to this criminal standard . '
Nevertheless , after Sept. 11 , Attorney General John Ashcroft issued new rules gutting the Levi guidelines .
Thanks to Ashcroft , FBI agents are now allowed to monitor public meetings even if they do n't have any reason to suspect that there 's any criminal activity being committed or planned .
" ' Now , that means if there is a rally of people who are criticizing the United States and its policies and saying that the United States will someday perhaps be destroyed because of that , the FBI agent can go and listen to what 's being said , ' Ashcroft told CNN 's Larry King in May of 2002 .
In other words , merely arguing that U.S. policies may result in the country 's destruction justifies FBI snooping .
This gives the FBI investigative license far beyond even that it enjoyed during the COINTELPRO period , let alone under the Levi Guidelines . "

“ This is a generation that is watching the world come undone , ” said David Orr , a professor of environmental studies at Oberlin .
Projects like the Oberlin house , he said , are “ helping them understand how to stitch the world together again . ”
Dr. Orr ’s course in ecological design became the incubator for the house when Mr. Brown and the two other founders of SEED , Kathleen Keating and Amanda Medress , enrolled in it last spring .
They had done research on sustainability houses at Middlebury , Brown and Tufts , and had persuaded the college to turn over an aging , drafty two - story house .
But before they could move in , they needed to make the house energy efficient .
The class studied water and energy use , insulation , heating and cooling , and financing .
Nathan Engstrom , Oberlin ’s sustainability coordinator  an essential position on many campuses these days  gave advice .
John Petersen , the college ’s environmental studies director , checked out the house ’s wiring .
The college spent $ 40,000 to renovate the house over the summer , bringing it up to safety code .
Mr. Brown used the carpentry skills he had learned from his father to pitch in on weatherizing .
The students moved in last September .
“ We sat down and had a meeting  ‘ O.K. , what next ? ’ ” Mr. Brown recalled .
“ We did n’t know what it meant to have a sustainable house . ”
That first night , amid confusion about who was home and who was out , they left the lights on .
“ We said , ‘ Oh , no , we just had a terrible first day , ’ ” Mr. Brown said .
“ ‘ We ’re leaving lights on everywhere . ’ ”

All year they studied together in the living room at night so they would not have to turn on lights in the other rooms .
They mastered worm composting , lowered the thermostat  keeping it at 60 degrees for most of the winter and piling on blankets  and unplugged appliances .
There is no television , but no one seems to consider that a hardship .

The fine lines between price and performance
Welcome to the most recent installment of the fabled Ars System Guide , a carefully - crafted resource for system building enthusiasts across the ' Net .
The goal , as always , is to provide three solid setups for do - it - yourself computing enthusiasts .
Some lucky bastards have unlimited funds , while others have to pinch every penny , but it 's possible to put together a potent PC for just about any budget .
The key is targeting different price / performance points ; to that end , our system guides offer three configurations .
For each component , we 'll explain why we think it 's the best fit for the system , always keeping in mind that " the best component " depends on the goals you 're trying to achieve ( and the budget you 're trying to achieve it with ) .
If you disagree , let us know why ; argue well enough , and you just might see your favored component make the next system guide .
If you 're trying to build an inexpensive system , we 've got your answer : the Budget Box .
This puppy is dedicated to finding the least expensive options possible while still giving you full functionality .
The Budget Box may sound cheap , but it 's not .
It 's thrifty power , priced at under $ 800 , and it can handle everything that Vista throws at it .
Our next step up the price / quality ladder is the Hot Rod .
This is a system built for power , but with limited ( read : realistic ) funds ; we 're looking for the best " bang for buck " on this one .
The Hot Rod is also a system that almost anyone can build .
Rather than cook up some mineral oil - soaked , refrigerator - powered machine , this box will fulfill your power - user requirements with requiring anything " Xtreme ! "
We aim to keep the Hot Rod beneath $ 1,600 , but performance is sometimes worth a few bucks extra .
Finally , there 's the God Box , so called because your friends may well bow down before its splendor .
Cost is no object ; if a part performs , we 're going to use it .
Sadly , you probably can't afford it unless you 've won the lottery or your company is paying the tab ( are those different things ? ) .
Still , we 're not throwing in diamond - encrusted heatsinks here ; even in the God Box , there 's no point in wasting money .
James Bond
Wristwatches have always been part of the secret agent 's accouterments .
Long before James
Bond ever appeared on the big screen , Ian Fleming in his novels had already issued James Bond with a wristwatch .
In " On Her Majesty 's Secret Service " , Bond uses his Rolex as a knuckle - duster and breaks his watch .
Contemplating on a replacement watch , Bond thinks , " A Rolex ?
Probably .
They were on the heavy side , but they work .
And at least you could see the time in the dark with those big phosphorous numerals " .
When James Bond progressed from novel to film his watch could now be seen .
In Dr. No , Sean Connery is clearly seen wearing a Rolex Submariner .
This watch is described in Dowling & Hess ' book .
Rolex Reference No. 6538 or 5508 is now known as the James Bond Submariner .
Bond 's arch enemies also wear interesting timepieces .
Three worth mentioning are Donald " Red " Grant , Goldfinger and Scaramanga .
Grant , an assassin played by Robert Shaw in From Russia With Love , has an unnamed wristwatch that has a retractable thin wire garrote .
This watch is seen for the second time in another Bond movie , On Her Majesty 's Secret Service .
George Lazenby picks up the watch from the top drawer of his desk with other mementos and contemplates leaving the Secret Service .
In the novel " From Russia With Love " , Grant 's watch is very well described .
" There was also a bulky gold wristwatch on a well - used crocodile strap .
It was a Girard - Perregaux model designed for people who like gadgets , and it had a sweep second - hand and two little windows in the face to tell the day of the month , and the month , and the phase of the moon " .
Gert Frobe who plays Goldfinger obviously wears a gold watch but which I cannot identify .
Christopher Lee who plays Scaramanga in The Man With The Golden Gun , is more than likely wearing a Rolex Cellini King Midas .
Listed below are the watches seen in the James Bond movies .

A dramatic fall in deaths from prostate cancer in the US has raised questions about Britain 's poor performance against the commonest cancer in men .
Deaths from the disease have declined four times faster in the US than in the UK over the past decade , having peaked in both countries in the early 1990s at almost identical rates .
Specialists claim that a combination of screening for early detection of the disease combined with more aggressive treatment is the secret of the US success .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But sceptics say screening and aggressive treatment come at too high a cost , causing unnecessary suffering to patients who did not need treatment and serious side effects such as impotence and incontinence .
There are 35,000 cases of prostate cancer diagnosed annually in the UK and 10,000 deaths .
Simon Collin and colleagues from the University of Bristol , who compared the US and UK , say the differing outcomes are worrying .
" Trends in US death rates in other cancers , such as breast and bowel , have closely followed those in the UK but for prostate cancer they have sharply diverged in the past decade .
Something different is happening with prostate cancer , " Mr Collin , a statistician , said .
Since the peak in deaths in the two countries in the early 1990s , mortality rates had fallen by 4.2 per cent a year in the US and by 1.2 per cent a year in the UK .
In the US , the biggest decline was among men over 75 while in the UK death rates in this age group had plateaued by 2000 .
A key difference between the countries lies in the extent of screening with the PSA ( prostate specific antigen ) blood test .
More than half ( 57 per cent ) of men over 50 reported being screened in the past 12 months , compared with 6 per cent in the UK .
In addition , treatment in the US is more aggressive , with a higher use of radical surgery , radiotherapy and hormone treatment .
Mr Collin said : " Prostate cancers are detected predominantly when they are still localised in the US because of screening , whereas in the UK they tend to be picked up later .
The big question is : does early detection lead to a survival benefit ? "
" It is plausible that early detection and more aggressive treatment does improve survival .
The caveat is that you detect a lot of prostate cancer if you look for it and much of it is indolent [ not needing treatment ] . "
Prostate cancer is often slow growing and does not affect the quality or length of the patient 's life .
In these patients , the treatment may be worse than the disease , Mr Collin said .
" The nature of prostate cancer is that you are more likely to die with it than from it . "
The authors of the study , published in Lancet Oncology , say the jury is still out on whether screening is worthwhile .
It is hoped the results of two trials next year will provide the answer .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average pared its losses Monday as the sell - off spurred by the fire sale of Bear Stearns was n't as bad as expected .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about half a percentage point -- and even tip - toed into positive territory at one point -- after plunging more than twice that at the opening bell .
The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq , however , were down more than 1 percent as investors worried about other firms to drop as a result of the credit crunch .
JP Morgan was the Dow's top gainer following news that the investment bank is paying just $ 2 a sharefor Bear Stearns , an unbelievable bargain , particularly when you consider that the stock was trading at a whopping $ 171 a share in January 2007 .
Some analysts point out that even Bear 's real estate is worth more than $ 2 a share .
The deal , announced late Sunday , values the fifth - largest U.S. investment bank at $ 236 million , one - fifteenth of its market value on Friday .
Among other blue chips pulling up the Dow were telecoms Verizon and AT&T , and health - care stocks such as Merck and Johnson & Johnson .
The Fed agreed to provide $ 30 billion of special financing to JP Morgan , to back some of Bear Stearns less liquid assets , which means if the assets decline in value , the Fed would take the hit , not JP Morgan .
Also late Sunday , the Fed lowered its discount rate , the rate at which it lends directly to banks , by a quarter percentage point to 3.25 percent .
The central bank also set up a program to provide cash to investment banks , something it has n't done since the Depression , nearly 80 years ago .
" This is going to get worse the longer the market prolongs the inevitable , " Joe Saluzzi , co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham , N.J. , told Reuters .
" With all these discount rate cuts , it seems like the Fed is running out of silver bullets .
Maybe they have to come up with something bigger . "
The dollar plunged to new lows following the news , prompting speculation that central banks around the world might step in to prop the ailing currency .
Oil and gold hit new record highs as investors fled to safety .
The news roiled world markets , with sell - offs across Asia and Europe , but it 's worth keeping it all in perspective .
" Coming out of this , someone 's going to win , " Brian Belski , chief U.S. sector strategist at Merrill Lynch , told CNBC .
" There has never been a period in the United States ' history -- economics and the stock market -- that we did n't come out of it , " Belski said .
" It 's just going to take time ..
It 's just a matter of where to buy and clearly investors have been too early to try to get in . "
Among the sectors ticking higher were semiconductors , telecoms , health - care and consumer staples .
Still , investors hammered financials , ex-JP Morgan , amid concerns that other investment banks will collapse under the weight of the credit crunch .
The S&P financials index dropped more than 4 percent .
" The fall of Bear Stearns was pretty much a victory for the rumor mongers , and that means possibly nobody 's safe , " Art Cashin , director of floor operations at UBS Financial Services , told CNBC .
" They 'll be rumors around about anybody ... they 'll see if they can cause a run wherever they are . "
Lehman Brothers plunged more than 20 percent amid rumors that it might be the next domino to fall .
Swiss bank UBS has also come under the microscope .
Among other big financial firms , Morgan Stanley declined , even though Goldman Sach suggested that it , along with JP Morgan , had one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector .
Citigroup was the biggest decliner on the Dow .
Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs also declined .

The government could be forced to rewrite anti-terrorism legislation after the high court today ruled that orders to freeze the assets of terrorism suspects are unlawful .
Mr Justice Collins decided that the asset - freezing orders imposed by the Treasury were legally flawed because they was introduced without parliamentary debate by Gordon Brown , when he was chancellor .
The challenge to the sanctions was brought by five men , identified in court only as A , K , M , Q and G , who deny any link to terrorism and have no previous convictions .
Lawyers for the five had argued in court that the regime set up under the Orders to apply UN Security Council resolutions - aimed at suppressing the financing of terrorist acts - was harsh and unfair .
The measures - contained in the Terrorism ( United Nations Measures ) Order 2006 and the al - Qaida and Taliban ( United Nations Measures )
Order 2006 – have never been scrutinised , debated or approved by parliament .
Collins said : " Counsel for the applicants have submitted that the means used to apply the obligations imposed by the UN resolutions is unlawful .
Parliament has been bypassed by the use of orders in council .
" But in deciding the appropriate way in which the obligation should be applied , and in particular in creating the criminal offences set out in the orders , it was necessary that parliamentary approval should be obtained .
Those submissions are , in my judgment , entirely persuasive . "
The judge added he was not saying that freezing orders could not be made to comply with UN resolutions .
But he said " parliamentary approval should be obtained " .
The asset - freezing order allows the government to freeze bank accounts , stop benefit payments and control the spending of people it has designated terror suspects .
Some 70 suspects are currently listed , and bank accounts containing about £ 500,000 have been frozen .
G , 27 , born in the Middle East and now a British national living in London 's east end , was the only claimant designated under both orders .
Earlier this week , the Times reported that ministers were considering incorporating asset - seizing powers into the counter - terrorism bill , if they lost the case .
The judgment is a further set back for the prime minister who is already facing a backbench rebellion over plans to lengthen the time that a terror suspect can be detained without charge to 42 days .
Pollution and global warming threaten Asia ’s most important freshwater source
Circle of Blue reports on a crucial but little - known factor in China - Tibet debate
By Keith Schneider and C. T. Pope
© 2008 Circle of Blue
Almost two years after a 710 - mile ( 1,100 kilometer ) railroad across the world ’s highest plateau opened from central China to the Tibetan capital of Lhasa , the deadliest clashes in a generation are occurring between Chinese police and young Tibetan protestors .
The fierce fighting , which erupted in March , has produced casualties on both sides and prompted demonstrations around the world .
Many analysts assert that the fighting is caused , at least in part , by fear that the Chinese government ’s long - standing strategy to open Tibet ’s vast reserves of copper , iron , lead , zinc , and other minerals will accelerate with the railroad ’s development .
But a number of influential scientists and experts in Asian studies now say that control and management of an even more vital resource – the Tibetan Plateau ’s vast supply of fresh water – is also emerging at the center of the increasingly tense political and cultural strife between China and Tibet .
Reservoir at top of the world is retreating
The Tibetan Plateau is an oxygen - scarce landscape of enormous glaciers , huge alpine lakes , and mighty waterfalls – a storehouse of freshwater so bountiful that the region serves as the headwaters for many of Asia ’s largest rivers , including the Yellow , Yangtze , Mekong , Brahmaputra , Salween , and Sutlej , among others .
According to studies by the United Nations and several prominent global environmental organizations , almost half of the world ’s population lives in the watersheds of the rivers whose sources lie on the Tibetan Plateau .
However , recent studies – including several by the Chinese Academy of Sciences – have documented a host of serious environmental challenges to the quantity and quality of Tibet ’s freshwater reserves , most of them caused by industrial activities .
Deforestation has led to large - scale erosion and siltation .
Mining , manufacturing , and other human activities are producing record levels of air and water pollution in Tibet .
Together , these factors portend future water scarcity that could add to the region ’s volatility .
Most important , the region ’s warming climate is causing glaciers to recede at a rate faster than anywhere else in the world , and in some regions of Tibet by three feet ( .9 meters ) per year , according to a report in May 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
The quickening melting and evaporation is raising serious concerns in scientific and diplomatic communities , in and outside China , about Tibet ’s historic capacity to store more freshwater than anyplace on earth , except the North and South Poles .
Tibet ’s water resources , they say , have become an increasingly crucial strategic political and cultural element that the Chinese are intent on managing and controlling .
“ At least 500 million people in Asia and 250 million people in China are at risk from declining glacial flows on the Tibetan Plateau , ” said Rajendra K. Pachauri , chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize , in an interview with Circle of Blue .
“ This is one of the great concerns – a staggering number of people will be affected in the near future .
There are n’t too many researchers who have looked at this water situation and its far - reaching impacts . ”
China among driest nations
With more than a quarter of its land classified as desert , China is one of the planet ’s most arid regions .
Beijing is besieged each spring by raging dust storms born in Inner Mongolia , where hundreds of square miles of grasslands are turning to desert each year .
In other parts of the nation , say diplomats and economic development specialists , Chinese rivers are either too polluted or too filled with silt to provide all of China ’s 1.3 billion people with adequate supplies of freshwater .
Chinese authorities have long had their eyes on Tibet ’s water resources .
They have proposed building dams for hydropower and spending billions of dollars to build a system of canals to tap water from the Himalayan snowmelt and glaciers and transport it hundreds of miles north and east to the country ’s farm and industrial regions .
But how long that frozen reservoir will last is in doubt .
In attempting to solve its own water crisis , China could potentially create widespread water shortages among its neighbors .
The IPCC warned a year ago that the glaciers in the world ’s highest mountain range could vanish within three decades .
“ Glaciers in the Himalayas are receding faster than in any other part of the world and , if the present rate continues , the likelihood of them disappearing by the year 2035 and perhaps sooner is very high if the earth keeps getting warmer at the current rate , ” the report said .
“ While the political issues swirling around Tibet and China are complex , there is no denying that water plays a role in China ’s interest in the region , ” said Peter Gleick , co-founder and president of the Pacific Institute in Oakland , California and one of the world ’s foremost authorities on water .
“ The water of Tibet may prove to be one of its most important resources in the long run – for China , and for much of southern Asia .
Figuring out how to sustainably manage that water will be a key to reducing political conflicts and tensions in the region . ”
A long struggle gets worse
Tibet lies north of India , Nepal , Bhutan , and Myanmar , west of China , and south of East Turkistan .
The highest and largest plateau on Earth , it stretches some 1,500 miles ( 2,400 kilometers ) from east to west , and 900 miles ( 1,448 kilometers ) north to south , an area equivalent in size to the United States region east of the Mississippi River .
The Himalayas form much of its southern boundary , and Tibet ’s average altitude is so high – 11,000 feet ( 3,350 kilometers ) above sea level – that visitors often need weeks to acclimate .
Though Tibet and China disagree about some details , the modern conflict between the two nations began in 1950 when China invaded Tibet with 40,000 troops , and a year later seized control of Lhasa .
Bloody clashes have broken out between Chinese forces and Tibetans periodically since then , with particularly fierce street fighting in the 1980s , and again this spring .
The new protests have attracted global attention , in large part because they are occurring just months before China hosts the Summer Olympic Games in Beijing .
The Tibetan Government in Exile , which settled in India in 1959 following the Dalai Lama ’s flight from Tibet , in recent years has consistently identified the plateau ’s water as a strategic resource and criticized China ’s management of it .
In a report earlier this decade , the exile government said China ’s water development plans , as well as global climate change , should cause concern across Asia , because it would “ seriously decrease [ the ] water supplies of India , Bangladesh , Vietnam , Cambodia , Thailand , Laos and Burma , as well as the Yangtze River Basin as far as Shanghai , especially in drought years .
Meanwhile , rural Tibetans continue to suffer high rates of hepatitis , water - borne infections , and back pain due to inadequate village water supplies . ”
China quietly acknowledges water tension
The Chinese government , in its studies , acknowledges the changing condition of Tibet ’s water supply .
Last summer , the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research , a unit of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , reported that the area and mass of the region ’s glaciers had decreased 7 percent since the late 1960s .
The Chinese scientists reported that the melting phenomenon was widespread , though it was not known how many of China ’s 46,298 glaciers were affected .
The short - term consequence of the receding glaciers , which the scientists said was due to global climate change , was that runoff in some rivers had increased .
But because of the deepening dry conditions of western China , the water was evaporating before it could be used .
The Chinese study offered no recommendations for reversing the melting or better managing the Tibetan Plateau ’s water .
Nor was there any discussion of the Chinese government ’s role in overseeing it .
And while most scientists in the region agree that the Tibetan Plateau ’s water resources are crucial to the future of China and Southern Asia , many declined to be interviewed for fear of losing access to their research sites .
Elizabeth Economy , the director of Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York , said it ’s not surprising that China is circumspect about the strategic consequences of the Tibetan Plateau ’s freshwater supplies .
“ Talking about this , or introducing it into any of their conversation about Tibet , just does n’t serve their purpose , ” she explained in an interview .
According to Economy , control of water resources in the Tibetan Plateau might be an issue internally , but externally , it is not .
“ China wants to minimize the range of issues it needs to negotiate .
Once this issue of water resources comes up , and it seems inevitable at this point that it will , it also raises emerging conflicts with India and Southeast Asia .
They also receive their water from the Tibetan Plateau , ” Economy said .
The new China - Tibet Railroad , built at a cost of roughly $ 4 billion , crosses terrain that illustrates China ’s water dilemma – dry high plains , teeming cities that are growing rapidly , lakes that are drying up , and glaciers that are retreating into rocky and impassable mountain ranges .
“ Water is seen as a strategic asset for China wherever it occurs in China , ” said Geoff Dabelko , director of the Environmental Change and Security Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington , D.C. “ Because so much of the water for China and the region originates in Tibet , it adds an additional level of importance and political sensitivity and context that does not get the attention it deserves . ”
Summing up the volatile situation , Dabelko added , “ Nearly two billion people are dependent on water originating on the Tibetan Plateau .
By definition , that makes it high politics and critically important in a politically strategic sense . ”

An estimated 70 percent of China ’s rivers are polluted , leaving an estimated 300 million people with limited access to clean water .
Almost half of the world ’s population lives in the watersheds of the rivers whose sources lie on the Tibetan Plateau .
Scientists say glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau are receding faster than in any other part of the world — if the rate continues , most will gone by 2035 .
There are more than 1000 lakes on the Tibetan Plateau , including the world ’s highest salt lake — Namtso ( Nam Co ) .
Both sourced in the Tibetan Plateau , the Yangtze ( Chang Jiang ) River and the Yellow River serve roughly 520 million people in China .
The Yangtze River is the third - longest in the world , after the Amazon and the Nile .

When contemplating the security of a web application , there are several attack vectors that you must consider .
An outsider may attack the operating system by planting a remote exploit , exercising insecure operating system settings , or brandishing some other method of privilege escalation .
Or , the outsider may attack other sites contained in the same server without escalating privileges .
( Note that this particular discussion does not touch upon the conditions under which an attack steals data from a single site .
Instead , I ’m focusing on the ability to attack different applications on the same server . )
With hosts providing space for large numbers of PHP - based sites , security can be difficult as the httpd daemon traditionally runs under the same Unix user for all sites .
In order to prevent these kinds of attacks from occurring , you need to concentrate on two areas :
Preventing the site from reading or modifying the data of another site , and Preventing the site from escalating privileges to tamper with the operating system and bypass user - based restrictions .
There are two toolboxes you use to accomplish this .
In the first case , you need to find a way to run all of your sites under different Linux users .
This allows the traditional Linux filesystem security model to provide protection against a hacked site attacking other sites on the same server .
In the second case , you need to find a way to prevent a privilege escalation to begin with and barring that , prevent damage to the operating system should an escalation occur .
Let ’s first take a look at a method to run different sites under different users .
The Python web framework provides several versatile methods by which applications can run .
There are three common methods : first , using Python ’s built - in http server ; second , running the script as a CGI application ; and third , using mod_python under Apache ( similar to what mod_perl and mod_php do ) .
These methods have various disadvantages : respectively , a lack of scalability , performance issues due to CGI application loading , and the aforementioned “ all sites under one user ” problem .
To provide a scalable , secure , high - performance framework , you can turn to a relatively new delivery method : mod_wsgi .
This Apache module , created by Graham Dumpleton , provides several methods by which you can run Python applications .
In this case , we ’ll be focusing on the “ daemon ” mode of mod_wsgi .
Much like mod_python , the daemon mode of mod_wsgi embeds a Python interpreter ( and the requisite script ) into a httpd instance .
Much like with mod_python , you can configure sites based on mod_wsgi to appear at various locations in the virtual directory tree and under different virtual servers .
You can also configure the number and behavior of child daemons on a per-site basis .
However , there is one important difference : with mod_wsgi , you can configure each httpd instance to run as a different Linux user .
During operation , the main httpd instance dispatches requests to the already - running mod_wsgi children , producing performance results that rival mod_python .
But most importantly , since each httpd instance is running under a different Linux user , you can apply Linux security mechanisms to different sites running on one server .
Once you have your sites running on a per-user basis , you should next turn your attention to preventing privilege escalation and protecting the operating system .
By default , the Targeted mode of SELinux provided by RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 ( and its free cousins such as CentOS ) provides strong protection against intrusions from httpd - based applications .
Because of this , you will need to configure SELinux to allow access to resources such as databases and files that reside outside of the normal httpd directories .
To illustrate these concepts , I ’ll guide you as you install a Trac instance under mod_wsgi .
The platform is CentOS 5 .
As a side note , it ’s highly recommended that you perform the installation and SELinux debugging in a XEN instance so that your environment only contains the software that is needed .
The sidebar explains how to easily install the environment that was originally used to perform this exercise , and I will assume that is your primary environment .
There are a few steps that require the use of a C compiler – namely , the installation of Trac – and I ’ll guide you through migrating these packages to your XEN - based test environment .
Installing Trac
In this example , you ’ll use a standard installation of Trac .
Following the instructions provided in the URL in the Resource section , begin by installing Trac 0.10.4 with ClearSilver 0.10.5 and SilverCity 0.9.7 .
( Note that with many Python web applications such as Trac and Django , “ installing ” the application means that you ’re actually installing the libraries necessary for Python to run the application .
You ’ll need to run a script to create the actual site . )
Next , create a PostgreSQL user and database on a different machine .
If you are using XEN for your development machine , you can use a PostgreSQL database running in your main DOM0 instance ; all we are concerned with is that the PostgreSQL instance is accessed on a different machine over the network .
( Note that MySQL will also work in this example , but SQLite will not .
In this case , we need a database engine that is accessed over the network , not as a disk file . )
After that ’s done , you ’ll need to create an actual Trac site .
Create a directory under / opt , such as / opt / trac .
Next , run the trac_admin command and enter the information prompted .
trac - admin /opt / trac initenv
Installing mod_wsgi
You can find mod_wsgi at the source listed in the Resources .
After you make sure the httpd_devel package is installed , installing mod_wsgi is as simple as extracting the tarball and issuing the normal ./ configure and ‘ make install ’ commands .
Running Trac under mod_wsgi
If you look under / opt / trac , you ’ll notice two directories : one labeled apache , and one with the label of the project that you assigned when you installed this instance of Trac .
You ’ll start by creating an application script in the apache directory .
The application script is listed in Listing 1 .
Listing 1 : /opt/trac/apache/trac.wsgi
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys
sys.stdout = sys.stderr
import os
os.environ [ ' TRAC_ENV '] = '/opt/trac/test_proj'
import trac.web.main
application = trac.web.main.dispatch_request
( Note the ‘ sys.stdout = sys.stderr ’ line .
This is necessary due to the way WSGI handles communications between the Python script and the httpd instance .
If there is any code in the script that prints to STDOUT ( such as debug messages ) , then the httpd instance can crash . )
After creating the application script , you ’ll modify httpd.conf to load the wsgi module and set up the Trac application .
After the LoadModule lines , insert a line for mod_wsgi :
LoadModule wsgi_module modules/mod_wsgi.so
Next , go to the bottom of httpd.conf and insert the text in Listing 2 .
This text configures the wsgi module for one particular site ; it can be used under the default httpd configuration as well as under VirtualHost directives .
Listing 2 : Excerpt from httpd.conf :
WSGIDaemonProcess trac user=trac_user group=trac_user threads=25
WSGIScriptAlias / trac /opt/ trac/apache/trac.wsgi
WSGIProcessGroup trac
WSGISocketPrefix run/wsgi
WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
Order deny , allow
Allow from all
Note the WSGIScriptAlias identifier .
The / trac keyword ( first parameter ) specifies where in the directory tree the application will exist .
With this configuration ,
If you go to your server ’s root address , you ’ll see the default CenOS splash page .
If you add / trac after the address , you ’ll hit your Trac instance .
Save the httpd.conf file .
Finally , add a Linux user called trac_user .
It is important that this user should not have login privileges .
When the root httpd instance runs and encounters the WSGIDaemonProcess directive noted above , it will fork itself as the user specified in the directive ; the fork will then load Python and the indicated script .
Securing Your Site
In this section , I ’ll focus on the two areas noted in the introduction : User based security and SELinux .
I will touch briefly on the theory of SELinux and explain the nuts and bolts of this particular implementation in more depth .
I highly recommend that you read the RedHat Enterprise Linux Deployment Guide for the particulars about how RedHat implements SELinux .
As with all activities involving some risk , if you plan to implement these methods , you should retain the services of a qualified security consultant to advise you about your particular situation .
Setting up the user - based security is not difficult .
Because the HTTPD instance containing Python and the Trac instance will run under the Trac user , you can safely set everything under / opt / trac / test_project for read and execute ( for directories ) for user and none for group / all .
By doing this , you will isolate this site from other sites and users on the system .
Now , let ’s configure SELinux .
First , you should verify that your system is running the proper Policy and Mode .
On your development system , you ’ll be using the Targeted policy in its Permissive mode .
If you choose to move your Python applications to a production machine , you would run under the Targeted policy , in the Enforcing mode .
The Targeted policy is limited to protecting the most popular network services without making the system so complex as to prevent user - level work from being done .
It is the only mode that ships with RedHat 5 , and by extension , CentOS 5 .
In Permissive mode , SELinux policy violations are trapped and sent to the audit log , but the behavior is allowed .
In enforcing mode , the violation is trapped and the behavior is not allowed .
To verify the Mode , run the Security Level Configuration tool from the Administration menu .
The SELinux tab , shown in Figure 1 , allows you to adjust the Mode .
After you have verified that SELinux is running in Permissive mode , you need to do two things .
First , you need to change the Type of the files under / opt / trac .
Second , you need to allow Trac to connect to the Postgres database that you configured when you installed Trac .
First , you need to tweak the SELinux file types attached to the files in your Trac instance .
These file types dictate what processes are allowed to access them .
For example , /etc / shadow has a very restrictive ‘ shadow ’ type that only allows a few applications to read and write it .
By default , SELinux expects web - based applications – indeed , anything using Apache – to reside under / var / www .
Files created under this directory have the SELinux Type httpd_sys_content_t .
When you created the Trac instance under / opt / trac , the files were created as type usr_t .
Figure 2 shows the difference between these labels
To properly label the files under / opt , issue the following commands as root :
cd /opt
chcon - R -t httpd_user_content_t trac /
After the file types are configured , there is one final step to do : allow Trac to connect to PostgreSQL .
In its default state , SELinux disallows outbound network connections for the httpd type .
To allow database connections , issue the following command :
setsebool - P httpd_can_network_connect_db=1
In this case , we are using the - P option to make this setting persistent .
If you omit this option , then the setting will be reset to its default state upon the next reboot .
After the setsebool command has been run , start HTTPD by issuing the following command :
/ sbin / service httpd start
If you visit the url http://127.0.0.1/trac, you should see the Trac screen such as that in Figure 3 .
ACLU considering Supreme Court appeal over NSA spying Nick Juliano
Published : Friday July 6 , 2007 Print This Email This The American Civil Liberties said Friday it is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court after a lower court threw out its case against the National Security Agency over an illegal domestic spying program authorized by the Bush administration .
 We are deeply disappointed by todays decision that insulates the Bush administrations warrantless surveillance activities from judicial review and deprives Americans of any ability to challenge the illegal surveillance of their telephone calls and e-mails , " ACLU legal director Steven Shapiro said in a prepared statement .
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision Friday dismissed the ACLU 's lawsuit on the grounds that the plantiffs , who included prominent journalists , scholars and attorneys , did not have legal standing to bring the case because they could not prove their phones had been tapped by the NSA .
The 2 - 1 ruling overturned a lower court 's injunction against the surveillance program .
" It is important to emphasize that the court today did not uphold the legality of the governments warrantless surveillance activity , " Shapiro said .
" Indeed , the only judge to discuss the merits clearly and unequivocally declared that the warrantless surveillance was unlawful . "
ACLU lawyers are " reviewing all of our legal options , including taking this challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court , " he said .
Meanwhile , the ACLU is urging Congress to exercise its oversight authority to investigate the spying program , which allows the NSA to monitor phone calls between people in the US and terrorism suspects abroad without first securing a warrant .
The Senate Judiciary Committee last month subpoenaed the White House requesting documents related to the NSA program , with a deadline for compliance of July 18 .
The White House has so far refused to turn over the requested surveillance - program information .
" There is a dark cloud over the White Houses warrantless wiretapping program , " said Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy in a statement released Friday , " and a full response to the outstanding subpoena from the Senate Judiciary Committee by this Administration would be a good start to clearing the air and moving forward in ways that allow us to better protect against terrorists while honoring the rule of law and the liberties of law - abiding Americans . 
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Legendary Texas oil man T. Boone Pickens has gone green with a plan to spend $ 10 billion to build the world ’s biggest wind farm .
But he ’s not doing it out of generosity - he expects to turn a buck .
T. Boone Pickens , famed oil tycoon and philanthropist takes part in the " The Future of Energy Prices " panel discussion during the 10th Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills , April 24 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
The Southern octogenarian ’s plans are as big as the Texas prairie , where he lives on a ranch with his horses , and entail fundamentally reworking how Americans use energy .
Next month , Pickens ’ company , Mesa Power , will begin buying land and ordering 2,700 wind turbines that will eventually generate 4,000 megawatts of electricity - the equivalent of building two commercial scale nuclear power plants - enough power for about 1 million homes .
“ These are substantial , ” said Pickens , speaking to students at Georgetown University on Thursday .
“ They ’re big . ”
Pickens knows a thing or two about big .
He heads the BP Capital hedge fund with over $ 4 billion under management , and earned about $ 1 billion in 2006 making big bets on commodity and equity markets .
Though a long - time oil man , Pickens said he has embraced the call for cleaner energy sources that do n’t emit heat - trapping greenhouse gases .
“ I ’m an environmentalist - I can pass the saliva test , ” he said .
But Pickens is not out to save the planet .
He intends to make money .
Though Pickens admits that wind power wo n’t be as lucrative as oil deals , he still expects the Texas project to turn at least a 25 percent return .
“ When I go into these markets , I expect to make money on them , ” Pickens said .
“ I do n’t expect to lose . ”
America is facing a looming power crunch , with electricity demand expected to grow 15 percent in a decade .
And while many states have rejected big coal - fired power projects on environmental concerns , they are offering a bounty of incentives to build renewable sources .
U.S. crude futures at new records above $ 115 a barrel means a bright future for renewable sources like wind and solar .
Pickens ’ wind farm is part of his wider vision for replacing natural gas with wind and solar for power generation , and using the natural gas instead to power vehicles .
To picture Pickens ’ energy strategy , imagine a compass .
Stretching from north to south from Saskatchewan to Texas would be thousands of wind turbines , which could take advantage of some of the best U.S. wind production conditions .
On the east - west axis from Texas to California would be large arrays of solar generation , which could send electricity into growing Southern California cities like Los Angeles .
The end result would be to free up more clean - burning natural gas - primarily a power - generation fuel now - to power automobiles .
Major oil companies have embraced so - called natural gas liquids because they have spent billions of dollars building refineries and pipelines to turn crude oil into gasoline , Pickens said .
But shifting natural gas used in power generation to transportation needs could cut U.S. crude oil imports by nearly 40 percent , he said .
If any real city on our planet can claim an active stake in creating the urban landscape of the future , it 's probably Dubai .

Tens of millions of British people will experience their own credit crunch on holiday this year as the soaring value of the euro forces them to pay more for everything from the price of a coffee in a Parisian cafe to a hotel room in Barcelona .
As currency traders pushed the European single currency to a record high against the pound yesterday , holidaymakers were coming to terms with the fact they now have almost a fifth less spending power on the Continent than a year ago .
The 17 per cent fall since last February has come about as the euro has powered ahead on the strength of its member economies , while the pound has slumped , most recently because of the knock - on effects of the sub - prime collapse in the US .
The euro's new high of 80 p , reached in early trading yesterday , came after the International Monetary Fund warned that UK growth would only hit 1.6 per cent this year , compared with the Government 's claim of up to 2.25 per cent .

The euro 's surge may spur new theories from economists that the currency of the eurozone will become the main international unit of currency as early as 2015 , upsetting almost the best part of a century of dominance of the dollar .
For holidaymakers , however , the collapse of the pound has an earthier reality that will curtail their spending power in shops and restaurants in Ireland and on the Continent .
In practice , it means spending money of £ 500 earmarked for eating out , trips and presents is now worth only £ 415 in the 15 eurozone states .
The 42 million foreign holidays a year that British people take are influenced by affordability and , during the past two years , the cheap dollar has lured thousands of Britons to stock up on designer jeans and iPods in New York .
However , the majority of foreign holidays , some 31 million , are taken in the eurozone and going there – and staying there – has become markedly more expensive .
As a result of the currency fluctuation , a family weekend break to Disneyland in Paris that would have cost £ 456 last year costs £ 533 this month .
A day 's car rental in Vienna that would have set back a Briton £ 56 now costs £ 67 .
And those expecting to savour a meal for two Ferran Adria 's acclaimed El Bulli restaurant in Spain will find the experience has risen in price from £ 195 to £ 236 .
Many people who had been hoping to go on holiday to France or Spain may be forced to change plans and stay at home instead .

Others may look for cheaper destinations outside the eurozone , such as Bulgaria or Croatia .
The Association of British Travel Agents said yesterday that the rise of the euro might prompt the growth in journeys to Turkey and Egypt as well as long - haul trips .
At home , the surging euro will apply upwards pressure on much that we import from the Continent , from cheese to cars , though retailers may take some of the pain .
But there will be a sign of relief from British companies battling to export their goods as their products become cheaper in the 15 euro countries .
After a shaky start in 1999 , when the economies of the 11 participating states were lurching downward , the euro has become a totemic success for the European project and has been rising against the pound for more than a year .
Further pressure is likely to be piled on to the pound – and in favour of the euro – today if , as expected , the Bank of England 's Monetary Policy Committee cuts interest rates .
Some economists believe the rate may cut by as much as half a per cent .
Geoff Kendrick , a currency strategist , said : " The UK has clearly softened a lot more than Europe and I guess that 's why we 'll see the Bank of England cut rates tomorrow while the ECB will be hawkish ...
At least for now it looks like the trend ( in euro / sterling ) is well and truly intact . "
The pound has weakened after days of bad economic news which has increased the chances of the interest rate being cut , reducing the attractiveness of holding the currency .
This week , the Halifax house price index posted its steepest monthly fall in over 15 years , a 2.5 per cent fall in a single month .
Banks have withdrawn their 100 per cent mortgage deals and Nationwide 's consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in four years .

INDIANAPOLIS , Ind. , May 1 , 2008 — Administrators at Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis ( IUPUI ) have revoked their finding that a student - employee was guilty of racial harassment merely for publicly reading the book Notre Dame vs. the Klan : How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan .
Following pressure from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education ( FIRE ) , IUPUI has declared that Keith John Sampson ’s record is clear and said it will reexamine its affirmative action procedures relating to internal complaints .
“ Just when you ’d thought you ’d seen every crazy act of censorship a college administrator can dream up , along comes a case where a student is found guilty of racial harassment simply for reading a book , ” FIRE President Greg Lukianoff said .
“ Thankfully , with time and public outrage , IUPUI ’s administration recognized Keith John Sampson had done nothing wrong and acknowledged that the First Amendment protects not only what you say , but also what you read . ”
In November 2007 , Sampson — who works in the school ’s janitorial department and is ten credits away from a degree in communications — was notified by Lillian Charleston of IUPUI ’s Affirmative Action Office ( AAO ) that two co-workers had filed a racial harassment complaint against him .
The AAO alleged that by reading a book on the KKK in the break room , Sampson had engaged in racial harassment .
Sampson attempted to explain that the book , written by Todd Tucker , was a historical account of the events on two days in May 1924 , when a group of Notre Dame students fought with members of the Ku Klux Klan .
His explanation was dismissed , and he later received a letter from Charleston that determined he was guilty of racial harassment .
Charleston wrote that his failures included “ openly reading the book related to a historically and racially abhorrent subject . ”
Sampson contacted the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana , which wrote to IUPUI ’s counsel several times demanding that the letter be removed from his file .
It was not until February 7 , 2008 , that IUPUI responded to Sampson , with a letter from Charleston which stated , “ if the conduct was intended to cause disruption to the work environment , such behavior would be subject to action by the University , ” but “ because I cannot draw any final conclusion in this instance , no such adverse disciplinary action has been or will be taken in connection with the circumstances at hand . ”
Since this letter neither reversed the guilty finding nor apologized for the damage to Sampson ’s reputation , FIRE wrote to IUPUI Chancellor Charles R. Bantz in March for clarification .
FIRE demanded that all documents regarding the guilty finding be expunged from Sampson ’s record , that IUPUI apologize for its handling of the incident , and that the school clarify and confirm its understanding of harassment law .
FIRE finally received a letter — six months after Sampson ’s ordeal began — from Bantz , stating that IUPUI “ regret[s ] this situation took place ” and is committed to upholding freedom of expression on its campus .
The letter also confirmed that no documents regarding the incident are in Sampson ’s file and that IUPUI hopes “ this experience as well as feedback from the campus community will result in an improved [ complaint ] process . ”
“ After six months of uncertainly , Sampson finally can be sure that he is in the clear , ” Lukianoff said .
“ We applaud higher - level administrators at IUPUI for taking this case so seriously and promising to reform , and we suggest to the lower - level administrators at IUPUI to remember the old adage , ‘ never judge a book by its cover . ' ”
FIRE is a nonprofit educational foundation that unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders , scholars , journalists , and public intellectuals across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of individual rights , due process rights , freedom of expression , and rights of conscience on our nation ’s campuses .

General Petraeus , commander of US forces in Iraq , and US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker just spent two days on the Hill testifying before various Congressional committees .
The spinning and misdirection required by members of this administration to make their policies appear even minimally rational continues to astound , and this latest round of dog - and - pony show did n’t change that in the slightest .
It ’s unbelievably frustrating and depressing for those of us who closely follow this stuff to watch two well - educated , highly competent , patriotic Americans sit before Congress and the American public and dissemble , either for political reasons or because they simply do n’t have an accurate understanding of the situation .
Petraeus said he would n’t consider reinstating the surge , which flies in the face of administration claims that troop levels are determined on the ground ( if we wo n’t raise troop levels if “ necessary ” and wo n’t reduce them even after these alleged security gains , what the hell determines the force structure ? ) , and Crocker pretended that Iran is n’t the main supporter of the political / militia group propping up our main man in Baghdad ( ISCI / Badr and Maliki , respectively ) , just as two examples .
There were some good questions , and Senators Webb , Biden , Obama , and Clinton all demonstrated facility with complex issues , and even House members , usually less incisive than their Senate colleagues simply because they have fewer staffers to write questions and prep responses , did a good job .
I mean , ultimately it is n’t that hard to ask tough questions , considering how intellectually bankrupt the administration approach continues to be .
But I doubt the past two days changed anything —
Republicans largely screwed up the facts and called Americans with doubts about the war unpatriotic , while Democrats tried again and again to get honest answer to reasonable questions , mostly to no avail , all as per the usual — and since all of these things are mostly pre-planned and scripted , a continuation of status quo was predictable ( and inevitable ) anyway .
And round and round we go .
By the way , Mark E. Rosenberg , 32 years old , of Miami Lakes , Florida , died yesterday in Baghdad from wounds suffered when his vehicle hit a roadside explosive device .
He ’s one of 18 US troops who have been killed in the past four days alone , the deadliest such stretch since last summer .
[ Disclaimer : Yahoo supports RDFa , which is a specification I ’ve worked on .
So , obviously , I ’m excited .
But hey , that does n’t mean I ’m wrong . ]
Yahoo recently announced SearchMonkey , and for the first time in 10 years , I have a reason to switch search engines , from Google to Yahoo ( In fact , I just did that in Firefox . )
Most web - savvy engineers know that online services succeed in big ways when they become platforms : when other developers can expand on the functionality in ways not foreseen by the original developers .
Yahoo is the first to figure out how to do just that with a major search engine .
With SearchMonkey , any developer gains the ability to provide custom ways of extracting and presenting page data within Yahoo search results .
Let ’s be specific …
Let ’s say I ’m a recruiter who often searches for candidates by searching the web .
I log in to Yahoo and add the “ Resume ” application .
From now on , whenever I search , each search result that is a page at LinkedIn , CareerBuilder , or Monster.com , is presented in a new layout which immediately highlights the skills and latest experience of each person right on the Yahoo research page .
Super cool .
And again , anyone can write this Resume application .
The code is hosted by Yahoo , so there is zero operational cost to the developer .
Users can pick and choose any number of Search Applications to customize their search experience .
In other words , because SearchMonkey applications are low - cost and targeted , they can fill highly specific needs , maybe the needs of a few hundred people only .
Developers get the power of the Yahoo search engine , with cheap customization down to tiny niches .
And the best part is that Yahoo has separated data extraction from data presentation .
Specifically , a data extractor for LinkedIn can produce RDFa , and different presentation applications can use different portions of that RDFa .
If the extractor for Monster.com produces the same RDFa , then the same presentation application can be used to display both Monster.com and Linked In data .
And if LinkedIn and Monster.com produce RDFa natively , within their web sites , then there ’s no need to build data extraction … the presentation application can work natively on the raw web pages .
And that ’s going to be the major incentive for web publishers to join the data web community , where human - rendered markup is augmented with machine - readable labels , using technology like RDFa .
This is quite exciting .
May 20 ( Reuters ) - White House hopefuls Barack Obama and John McCain have sparred over whether U.S. presidents should meet with adversaries , in a clash that could help define the foreign policy debate ahead of the November U.S. presidential election .
But Washington has a long history of talking to its enemies and the differences between Republicans and Democrats may be less stark than some of the heated rhetoric suggests .
Following are comments by some U.S. political figures over engaging foes :
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH , speaking to the Israeli parliament on May 15 :
" Some seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along .
We have heard this foolish delusion before .
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : ' Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided . '
We have an obligation to call this what it is -- the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history . "
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
BARACK OBAMA , an Illinois senator , was asked in a July 23 , 2007 , Democratic candidates ' debate whether he would be willing to meet without precondition with the leaders of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , Cuba and North Korea during his first year in office .
" I would , " Obama said .
" And the reason is this , that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them -- which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration -- is ridiculous . "
Obama has since emphasized that while he would not set preconditions for a presidential meeting with U.S. foes , there would be plenty of preparations at the staff level .
" What are George Bush and John McCain afraid of ? " Obama said on Monday in Billings , Montana .
" Demanding that a country meets all your conditions ... before you meet with them , that 's not a strategy , it 's just naive wishful thinking , " he said .
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE
JOHN MCCAIN , an Arizona senator , has criticized Obama 's stand , especially on talking with the Iranian leader .
" It is a serious error on the part of Senator Obama , " McCain said on May 15 .
" It shows naivete and inexperience and lack of judgment to say that he wants to sit down across the table from an individual who leads a country that says that Israel is a stinking corpse , that is dedicated to the extinction of the state of Israel .
My question is , what does he want to talk about ? "
At a town hall meeting in Miami on Tuesday , McCain planned to highlight Cuba to further press his point , saying that a U.S. presidential meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro would send " the worst possible signal to Cuba 's dictators . "
" I believe we should give hope to the Cuban people , not to the Castro regime , " McCain was to say , according to speech excerpts released by his campaign .
U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES , in a May 14 speech to the American Academy of Diplomacy , said : " We need to figure out a way to develop some leverage with respect to the Iranians and then sit down and talk with them . "
" If there 's going to be a discussion , then they need something , too , " Gates added .
" We ca n't go to a discussion and be completely the demander with them not feeling that they need anything from us . "
Defense Department spokesman Geoff Morrell later said Gates was talking more about contact between private U.S. citizens and Iranians than government - to - government discussions .
" I can tell you there is absolutely no gap between the secretary 's position on Iran and the president 's position on Iran , " Morrell said .
FORMER PRESIDENT AND NOBEL LAUREATE JIMMY CARTER , speaking to ABC News before his April 17 meeting with Hamas leaders in Egypt :
" I think there 's no doubt in anyone 's mind that , if Israel is ever going to find peace with justice concerning the relationship with their next - door neighbors , the Palestinians , that Hamas will have to be included in the process .
" I think someone should be meeting with Hamas to see what we can do to encourage them to be cooperative . "
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES BAKER , CO - CHAIRMAN OF THE IRAQ STUDY GROUP , speaking before the Senate on Dec. 7 , 2006 , in defense of the panel 's recommendation that Washington engage Iran and Syria for help in stabilizing Iraq :
" What do we lose by saying , ' We 're getting all of Iraq 's neighbors together , we want you to come , ' and if they say no , we show the world what they 're all about ? "
NANCY PELOSI , SPEAKER OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , on April 2 , 2007 , on the eve of meeting with Syrian President Bashar al - Assad in Damascus :
" When we go there we 'll be talking about the overarching issue of the fight against terrorism and the role that Syria can play to help or to hinder .
We think it 's a good idea to establish the facts , to hopefully build some confidence between us ... we have no illusions but great hope . "

The needle is twenty - one gauge , one and a half inches .
A hog sticker .
Forty of them arrived in a package from Greece .
Ever received a package from overseas ?
You get that puff of air when you rip it open -- air that 's traveled thousands of miles .
Foreign , like stepping into a stranger 's house .
The syringe wrapper has instructions in Italian , French , Greek , and Arabic -- not a word of English .
But it 's a needle .
Operation is self - explanatory .
I had put them out on my desk a few days ago -- an unignorable fact .
An invitation .
A threat .
Buck up , laddie .
Fortune favors the brave .
What 's inside resembles oily piss : 1 cc of Equipoise , a veterinary drug injected into horses , and 2 cc 's testosterone cypionate , ten times the testosterone an average man my size naturally produces in a week .
It was going into my ass ; plenty of meat there .
But the sciatic nerve radiates from my hip , and if I hot - shot the junk into a vein , I could go into cardiac collapse .
I tucked a bag of frozen corn beneath my underwear to numb the injection site .
The hash marks on the syringe were smudged away by my sweaty hands .
That could n't be a sign of quality medical equipment , could it ?
What if I died in this shitty efficiency apartment in Iowa City ?
I pictured the landlord stumbling upon my body , rotten and bloated .
The newspaper headline : " Dumbshit Canadian Found Dead with Needle in Ass . "
The needle slid in so easily , I was n't aware it'd broken the skin .
I aspirated and injected into the deep tissue .
When I pulled it out , a pressurized stream of blood spurted halfway across the room .
A while back I wrote a novel .
A lot of first - time novelists do n't stray far from home ; their stories are drawn from their lives .
Holds true for me :
The main character is ... well , me .
That 's not quite true .
He 's wealthier , pampered , more dismissive .
But his deep - seated fears , his inborn weaknesses -- those we share intimately .
My character goes down dark roads .
For the sake of the book , I thought I 'd travel those roads with him .
He begins to work out obsessively .
I began to work out obsessively .
He joins a boxing club .
I joined a boxing club .
He takes steroids .
I took steroids .
The thing is , I 've never done drugs .
I therefore lacked the ability to spot the dealer in a room .
Such was my quandary when it came to steroids .
Where to buy ?
Who to ask ?
I 'd heard your local gym was a good place , but I did n't have the first clue how to go about that .
So I typed " steroids " into Google , which promptly introduced me to an Internet scam .
I purchased a bottle of what I thought was a steroid called Dianabol .
But what I received was Dianobol , which , for all I know , were rat turds pressed into pill form .
Effective as Flintstone chewables .
I 'll not go into great detail about how I came to possess real steroids -- or " gear , " as we 'roiders call them .
The whole thing makes me look as stupid as I was .
Suffice it to say the process involved an encrypted e-mail account , a money order wired to Tel Aviv , and weeks of apprehension -- Had I been ripped off ?
Would DEA agents break down my door ? -- before the package arrived , pills and ampules and six vials wrapped in X - ray - proof paper .
Anabolic steroids hit U.S. gyms in the early 1960s , courtesy of John Ziegler , the Americans ' team doctor at the 1954 World Weightlifting Championships in Austria .
He watched in horror as his countrymen were decimated by Soviet he - men who , he later found out , received testosterone injections as part of their regimen .
Ziegler teamed up with a pharmaceutical firm to create the synthetic testosterone Methandrostenolone , better known by its trade name , Dianabol .
The biological function of anabolic ( tissue - building ) steroids is to stimulate protein synthesis -- that is , heal muscles more quickly and effectively .
New muscle is gained , in part , by tearing the tubelike fibers running the length of our muscles ; protein molecules attach to the broken chains , creating new muscle .
While on steroids , your muscle fibers become greedy , seeking out every stray protein molecule .
I had a misconception that being " on steroids " involved the ingestion or injection of a single substance , but that was quickly dispelled .
Many steroids on their own are either singular of purpose or not terribly effective .
This is where " stacking " comes in :
You can put on mass ( 75 mg of testosterone ) , provide muscle hardness ( 50 mg of Winstrol ) , and keep water retention to a minimum ( 50 mg of Equipoise ) .
This stack is injection - intensive : testosterone and Equipoise twice weekly , Winstrol daily .
Eleven injections a week .
But that 's only steroids .
You need drugs to stave off the potential side effects : hair loss , gynecomastia ( buildup of breast tissue due to increased estrogen , aka gyno , aka bitch tits ) , testicular atrophy , cranial and prostate swelling , erratic sex drive , liver impairment , hemorrhoids , impotence , cysts , acne , abscesses , renal failure .
Hair loss , gyno , and testicular atrophy should be considered absolute rather than potential hazards :
You simply cannot alter your body 's chemical makeup so drastically without your body reacting .
My own steroid cycle :
-- Dianabol ( 10 mg tabs , three per day for the first four weeks )
-- Testosterone cypionate ( 500 mg per week , ten weeks )
-- Equipoise ( 400 mg per week , ten weeks )
-- Nolvadex ( antiestrogen drug ; one to four pills daily depending on week )
-- Proviron ( male - menopause drug ; 25 mg daily )
-- HCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin , derived from the urine of pregnant women ; used during postcycle therapy to restore natural testosterone levels ; 500 iu's twice weekly , administered with an insulin needle )
Some of this stuff showed up in the Mitchell report -- Lenny Dykstra allegedly bought Deca - Durabolin , testosterone , and Dianabol when he was with the Phillies , and Jose Guillen and infielder Matt Williams were both mentioned as testosterone - cypionate users .
Does n't look like it , but mine was a fairly mild cycle .
Including diuretics and cutting and hardening agents , professional bodybuilders may have fifteen substances floating around in their systems at any given time .
Like alcohol or drugs , a body 's tolerance builds up .
Top pros might inject up to 2,500 mg of testosterone weekly to produce the desired effect .
The first week of the cycle , my nipples start to itch .
Onset of gynecomastia .
Dump enough testosterone into your body , your system counters by upping its estrogen output ; this leads to a buildup of breast tissue .
After long - term use it can get so bad , some men require surgical breast reductions .
I woke up one morning and nearly had a heart attack at the sight of myself .
My nipples were the size of sand dollars , stretched smooth as the skin of a balloon .
My flesh looked as if it were swelling into small pouches , like the rubberized nipples on a baby bottle .
I appeared to have breasts .
Pendulous , malformed ... breasts .
Or was I just chubby and still out of shape ?
I did n't know .
Gave them a jiggle .
Could n't tell if it was fluid buildup or actual skin .
Could you grow new flesh overnight ?
Maybe these had been there before , back when I was n't studying every inch of my body .
Either way , I did n't want tits -- that would go against the whole purpose of the exercise .
I gobbled twice my daily allotment of antiestrogen meds and pulled a ribbed undershirt over my awful sweater puppies .
Double shots of Nolvadex would control the gyno .
But by then my hair was falling out .
I went into this with my natural scalp of unruly , bushmanlike red hair .
While I 'd never been keen on its tendency to coil into ringlets , there had always been plenty of it .
Then one morning I was showering , looking at my shampoo - foamed fingers , and spotted dozens of red strands .
Soon they were everywhere : my pillow , between my teeth , falling onto the pages of books .
I became hyperaware of the way wind felt through my hair : now much colder on the top of my scalp .
Not a single follicle seemed moored to my skin .
Then one sleepless night ( the steroids also triggered insomnia ) , my testicles shrunk .
Testicular atrophy is the most well - known side effect of steroid abuse .
It 's an inherent irony :
Here you are trying to turn yourself into an überman while the most obvious manifestation of your manhood dwindles before your eyes .
Female users suffer the opposite reaction :
Their clitorises become so swelled that in extreme cases they resemble a tiny penis .
Basically , you inject so much testosterone that you rob your gonads of purpose ; they enter dormancy for the duration of your cycle .
And while I knew this would happen , the physical sensation was beyond horrible .
This rude clenching inside my scrotum , a pair of tiny hands grasping the spermatic cords and tightening into fists .
" No more testosterone ! " my balls cried .
" Closed for business ! " I sat up in the dark , gasping , clutching them to make sure they were still there .
Within days they had shrunk to half their normal size : sad , shriveled grapes .
Another sleepless night a week later , I swore I felt a ridge on my forehead .
Cranial swelling -- most often a Neanderthal - like ridge forming above the user 's brow -- is commonly associated with HGH , or human growth hormone , originally made from the pituitary glands of fresh cadavers .
But cranial swelling assumes many forms :
In addition to " caveman brow , " some users find semisolid lumps forming on their foreheads .
Some grow to the size of hard - boiled eggs and require surgical removal .
The next morning , an inspection in the bathroom mirror :
Was that a slight swelling across the top of my eyebrows ?
It seemed impossible -- this only happens in extreme cases .
My own perceived bulge was not altogether solid , sort of mushy , but I had this terrifying sense my bone structure had somehow been altered .
This was the primary fear I ran up against :
Were these changes happening ?
Would they subside once I quit ' roiding , or were they permanent ?
I could handle rampant hair loss , a caveman head , shrunken testicles , hell , even tits , so long as it was temporary .
What if it was n't ?
My sixth injection goes badly .
I 've been shooting my glutes , and while it 's relatively painless , the skin has gone tight and I 'm guessing the oil has n't dissolved .
I stick my thigh instead .
The needle goes in half an inch before hitting a major nerve .
My leg bucks uncontrollably , knee nearly striking my forehead .
Blood leaks from the puncture down my leg .
I try my calf .
Sitting cross-legged , ankle propped on knee , I push the needle in .
Goes in easy , but when I aspirate , the syringe fills with blood : hit a vein .
Wipe the needle with rubbing alcohol , try another spot : blood again .
Boot the excess onto a paper towel , plug a fresh needle onto the syringe , try again : blood .
It 's bubbling out of my thigh and the neat triangle of holes in my calf .
What am I , all veins ?
End up back at my glutes .
After injecting , I regret it : A bubble of oil the size of a pearl onion now lies an inch under my skin .
When I massage it , the bubble wobbles , all of one piece .
It 's still there come nighttime .
I feel it pressed against my hipbone , solid as a ball bearing .
Like the princess with a pea under her mattresses , I have a hard time sleeping .
To embark on a steroid cycle is to devote yourself to rituals .
Wake up , eat , medicate , work out , eat , work out , eat , medicate , sleep .
Repeat daily for sixteen weeks .
Eating becomes a ritual .
To maximize muscle growth , you must take your weight and eat its equivalent in grams of protein per day .
But I pushed my target further : 337.5 grams of daily protein .
Consider that a great source of natural protein -- a can of tuna -- contains thirteen grams .
I 'd have to eat more than twenty - five cans a day .
The max I was ever able to ingest was twenty , forked straight from the can .
It is sheer lunacy to eat twenty cans of tuna .
I managed to choke down six cans a day , supplemented with five to six protein shakes , and I still fell short of the target .
I went through four 2.47 - pound tubs of Muscle Milk a week , 158.08 pounds all told .
I kept shoveling a limited spectrum of foodstuffs -- tuna , oatmeal , egg whites , boiled chicken -- into my mouth like a robot .
Thankfully , Equipoise , developed to increase lean body weight in horses , gave my appetite a healthy boost .
Injections become a ritual .
Run the vials under hot water to warm the oil .
Draw 1 cc Equipoise , 1.5 cc 's testosterone .
Tap the syringe to release air bubbles , push the plunger until a bead forms at the pin tip .
Swab the injection site and inject slooow , massaging to help it soak in .
Was n't much different from how any addict went about things .
You reach a point where the careful steps and resultant anticipation becomes as heady as the rush itself .
Sometimes I could n't stop shaking as I prepared my needles .
The workout becomes a ritual .
But I 'd push myself past the limit .
I 'd lift until my arms hung like dead things .
I took postworkout naps in the locker room , spread out on a bench , too exhausted to walk home .
Once I caught the smell of ozone , saw these awful black lights , came to sprawled on the gym floor .
Week six my prostate swells up .
The prostate is an organ I associate with old men .
Surgical - gloved fingers .
Not in any way an organ I should be cognizant of .
And yet I was , as this benign organ had swollen to the point that it felt like a fist - sized balloon pressed against my testicles .
Another fairly common side effect for some professional bodybuilders is prostatitis , which can get to such an extent that they require catheterization .
Imagine steroids as an A - bomb :
If your testicles are ground zero , your prostate lies squarely in the fallout zone .
I was urinating fifteen times a day .
A swollen prostate crimps the urethral tube , making it torture to piss .
It also crowds the bladder , making it feel as if you always need to piss , even if there 's nothing to pass .
I 'd stand over the toilet , coaxing , cajoling , only to produce a squirt .
My urine took on the disturbingly rich hue of cask - aged brandy .
I heard " vigorous manual relief " helped ease prostate pain .
But when I tried this , it felt as though the pipe connecting the sperm factory to its exit had been clothespinned -- not much came out , and the little that did looked embarrassed .
The key , I discovered , was continual application .
I became obsessed with manual relief .
Three or four times a day I was manually relieving myself .
With all that extra testosterone , it did n't take much to get the motor humming .
I was relieving myself to photos of muscle - bound women gracing tubs of protein powder .
I was relieving myself to Vanna White .
I relieved myself to a perfumed insert ripped from a magazine .
To a smell .
Wake up , eat , jerk off , work out , eat , jerk off , eat , work out , eat , jerk off , eat , sleep .
The question you 're asking by this point is , Why did n't he stop ?
Why , despite all the awful side effects , did he keep plugging needles into himself ?
I 'm sure my answer is no different from most users ' : the results .
Once we pass that period of massive physical change , puberty and growth spurts , we settle into a sense of our bodies .
We understand its parameters and capabilities .
And though it 's disheartening to say , at thirty I was finding evidence of a body on its downslope .
While I worked out plenty pre-steroids , I had n't made a sizable gain in years .
In gym parlance , I 'd " plateaued . "
Ailen Lujo
Steroids shattered the inborn limitations of my body .
I first sensed their effects bench - pressing dumbbells .
I usually max out at 170 pounds -- two 85 - pound weights .
But ten reps with the 85's felt like a warm - up .
I was stunned .
With trepidation -- I was now eyeing weights that if mishandled could break some ribs -- I picked up the 90 - pounders .
They went up easy ; I gutted out ten reps .
An out - of - body sensation : somebody else 's arms pushing those weights , someone else 's pectorals flexing .
I went up to 100 - pounders -- benching roughly my own body weight .
I 'd been locked at 160 to 170 pounds for years , and in the course of a single workout , I 'd shot up 30 pounds .
My workout weights skyrocketed .
I was doing wide - grip chin-ups with a 35 - pound plate strapped to my waist , shoulder - pressing 75 - pound dumbbells , slapping 45 - pound plates on the biceps bar , and bottoming out Nautilus machines .
My body exploded -- 205 pounds to 235 in the space of a few weeks .
In 'roider vernacular , I 'd " swallowed the air hose . "
I became a huffer , a grunter , a screamer .
Anyone who frequents gyms knows those guys who make ungodly noises while hurling weight around .
I 'd always found their displays childish and tended to look away , as I would from a toddler having a tantrum in a supermarket .
So imagine my surprise to find myself bellowing , shrieking , groaning .
A silverback gorilla 's mating ritual : I wanted everyone to know I was the biggest , toughest motherfucker in the joint .
" Hoooo - aaahhh ! "
" Eeeeeee - yahhh ! "
" Wa - wa - wa - euuuugh - UH ! "
Look at me !
I 'm a big , strong boy !
It was pathetic .
I should have known better -- actually , I did know better , but I did n't let that stop me .
Those " pumps " clouded all judgment .
My glances at the gym mirrors were at first baffled , " Is that me ? " double takes that mutated into looks of preening narcissism .
I noticed how light played upon my chest and arms , the pockets of blue shadow filling my new contours .
All fake .
Chemical sorcery .
Freakish .
I had n't earned it .
But it 's like the woman with giant fake breasts :
Everyone knows they 're fake , but dammit if they do n't still draw the looks .
That oil I shot into my hip had n't dissolved .
A deep , throbbing pain convinced me I 'd developed an abscess .
I had a pouch of weeks - old oil inside my hip , walled off by my immune system .
If I was lucky , it was sterile .
If not , it was infected , the surrounding tissue gone necrotic .
I decided to drain it by injecting an empty needle to draw out the stale oil .
My hope was that it was still liquid ; if it was congealed , gone to lard , I 'd need medical attention .
The needle sunk into the pocket of infected tissue .
The pain was expected and oddly bearable .
Drawing back the plunger only earned me a few drops of clear broth .
I disconnected the syringe and left the needle jutting out , applying pressure to the surrounding skin .
Blackish fluid the consistency of crankcase oil dripped out .
Disgusting and scary , but the pressure subsided .
Once I 'd squeezed it out , I filled another syringe with sterile water , attached it to the needle still stuck in my skin , injected it , unclipped the syringe , and squeezed the water out .
A decent job for an untrained meatball the likes of myself .
Did the trick : A week later , I could comfortably sleep on my side again .
Week twelve I max out at 240 pounds .
Packed on 35 pounds in less than three months .
My body had gone through an extreme thickening process .
Pectoral muscles : solid slabs of meat hung off my clavicles .
Latissimus dorsi muscles flared out from the midpoint of my back : the " cobra 's hood . "
Triceps and biceps so swelled , my T - shirt sleeves bunched up at my shoulders , too narrow to fit over my arms .
Could n't walk more than a few blocks before a fist - sized stone settled upon my lower back .
There were areas I could not reach due to my new size ; to scratch my back , I went to the kitchen for a fork .
One night I was watching a legal drama , one of those ripped - from - the - headlines shows .
A morbidly obese man was suing a snack - cake company , which he held responsible for his obesity .
The main ingredient in those snack cakes was high - fructose corn syrup , a compound that inhibits the hormone leptin , which signals to the brain that the stomach is full .
Essentially , leptin tells us to stop eating .
But if this signal is never received , a person will eat past the point of reason or safety .
Steroids are like high - fructose corn syrup :
They fool a body into a sense that it is stronger and more resilient than it is .
You accomplish feats that in your heart and mind you know are beyond you , but you feel so good , so damn strong , you convince yourself otherwise .
After the weight - room euphoria wears off , you 're forced to acknowledge the effects of self - delusion .
My joints felt hyperextended : constantly popping and cracking , noises like lug nuts in a cement mixer .
I felt calcified , hardened , and frighteningly old .
Within a month after my cycle ends , everything has changed .
The first thing I notice upon waking these days is that I feel ... well , good .
No sluggishness , only minor joint pain .
Genuinely refreshed .
Then , on my way to the bathroom one morning , I sense a new weight between my legs -- my testicles !
Great to have you back , boyos !
The feeling of elation lasts ten paces : my bed to the bathroom mirror .
I 'm staring at a human boneyard .
Where are my pecs ?
I see two shriveled bags hanging off my chest .
Arms -- dear Lord , my arms !
Shapeless shoestrings dangling from a pair of rotten - apple shoulders .
Stomach a deflated clown balloon .
Legs belonging to a coma victim .
Step on the scale : 222 pounds .
Thirteen pounds , most of it fluid , shed virtually overnight .
Now , only the most deluded of 222 - pound men can stare into a mirror and see a zombified horror staring back .
But I 'd lost it .
Most of what I 'd gained : washed away .
Popeye without his spinach .
Weak and broken and utterly human .
All the needles , the piss of pregnant women running through my veins , the fainting spells and sleepless nights , the muscle knots and bitch tits and shrunken gonads and the hair in my food and fears of abscesses and caveman brow -- every risk I 'd taken , all that sweat and toil for fuck - all .
Things worsened at the gym .
Chest day : dumbbell presses .
I settled on the nineties ; if I could lift them , it'd be a ten - pound increase over my precycle max .
I barely got them off my chest .
I struggled through a single rep , arms quaking , and hit failure .
The dumbbells crashed down as I rolled awkwardly off the bench .
A total fraud .
Everyone who'd been watching me heave massive weight about , bellowing like a steer in rut -- all these knowing eyes saw me as a charlatan .
I fell into a funk .
Scoured my apartment : the tuna , the protein powder -- trash - canned all of it .
Next order of business : large pizza , pepperoni and double cheese , wolfed down with gulps from a two - liter bottle of Pepsi .
I yearned to get fat and disgusting .
The rational part of my mind went , You did the research .
You knew this would happen .
But the other part -- the part most closely tied to my body , the part now used to the weight - room glances and the more defined , burlier cast of my shadow , the part that relished people ceding room on narrow sidewalks -- was not to be consoled .
I went to the doctor 's office .
I felt much better with the cycle over , but I still suffered aches and pains .
The results :
A partially herniated disc .
The result of either bad posture or an accumulation of pressure due to excess body weight .
A chiropractic visit was scheduled .
An enlarged prostate .
I was prescribed Avodart , which did wonders .
Fluid buildup on left knee -- again , the result of excess weight .
The doctor told me he'd get back to me with the results of my blood work .
I started out overweight at 205 pounds , ended up 208 .
My body now looked worse than before the steroids .
Bloated somehow , like I 'd died , my body abandoned in a gassy swamp .
Small but prominent nipple - nubbins poked out when I wore anything tighter than a golf shirt .
Had it been worth it ?
The question presupposes my expectation to benefit from the experience .
I embarked on the cycle to bring a sense of real - world truth to my novel .
Feel what my character felt , experience that portion of his life to write with conviction about it .
I was somewhat ashamed .
What had I done to myself ?
Jeopardized my chances at having a child ?
I worried about that more than anything else .
Had it been worth it ?
Somewhere along the line I 'd been let off the hook .
My grandfather , father , uncles , men of generations past -- they did n't get the free pass I did .
Their lives were poverty , wars , factory floors , untilled fields .
They endured .
What have I ever had to endure ?
I felt unworthy of all I 'd been so carelessly given .
And loathed myself for taking it .
Maybe this was a way to put myself back on the hook .
Self - destruction is an underappreciated art form .
I currently weigh 170 pounds .
The blood tests showed my liver values were totally out of whack .
As I had never been able to convince a woman that I was a viable prospect to make a baby with before using , I 'll never know if an inability to conceive , should that end up being the case , is attributable to steroids or the innate decrepitude of my seed .
Did I take steroids to write a book , or did I write a book as an excuse to take steroids ?
Often all you want is to step off the path you 've carved , the terrain having become too rocky -- or in my case , too smooth .
And when my body began to fall apart , when the drugs began to destroy me , I persisted under the belief that all suffering on my part was long past due .
I would endure .
The eventual understanding that a certain nobility underlay my grandfather 's suffering , whereas mine was not much more than a masochistic stubbornness -- I 'd like to think that stopped me .
And when I 'd stare at myself naked and porcine in the bathroom mirror , like some escapee from the island of Dr. Moreau , I told myself that if nothing else , I 'd suffered .
Ashamed to admit I took pride in that , too .

The most consistent rationale for ISPs to throttle p2p applications or charge by the byte is that a small minority of users drain a vastly disproportionate amount of bandwidth , like the planet - raping aliens in Independence Day .
Om Malik pulls a few of these numbers out of Arbor Networks ' CTO , who develops all the traffic management tools your ISP probably uses , so while there 's a conflict of interest ( portents of internet doom sell more stuff ) they have the data .
Ten percent of subscribers consume 80 percent of bandwidth , a super - leeching 0.5 percent swallow 40 percent of bandwidth , and the rest like your mom , 80 percent , sip less than 10 percent .
But p2 p is n't the culprit .
Advertisement
No , p2p is no longer the single biggest traffic whore , responsible for only 20 percent of total traffic .
It 's streaming video , like YouTube and Hulu , which is now 50 percent of total traffic .
During peak congestion — the times when Comcast will slow you down for hitting the pipe too hard — 70 percent of it is http .

Which explains Comcast 's flip on network management and why it 's a total smokescreen .
P2P is no longer the number one leech on networks , it 's streaming video across regular old http .
So they do n't need to throttle p2p exclusively anymore — they need to slow the whole pipe down , hence the new " protocol agnostic " scheme .
But they can look good showing off how much they love p2 p .
It remains to be seen how much of it the FCC will eat up .

The dean of the Senate , Robert Byrd of West Virginia has endorsed Barack Obama today .
Byrd focused on ending the Iraq war , “ As people all across this great nation know , I have been one of the most outspoken opponents of the Bush administration ’s misguided war in Iraq and its saber rattling around the globe . ”
Byrd said that he did n’t endorse Obama before because he had , “ no intention of involving myself in the Democratic campaign for President in the midst of West Virginia ’s primary election .
But the stakes this November could not be higher . ”
Byrd concluded , “ Barack Obama is a noble - hearted patriot and humble Christian , and he has my full faith and support . ”
Byrd is the oldest member of the U.S. Congress and the longest serving Senator in the nation ’s history .
He has held office since January 3 , 1959 .
What makes this endorsement even more amazing is that Byrd was a segregationist and a former member of the KKK , but after the death of his grandson in 1982 , Byrd changed his views and has been consistently awarded an approval rating of 100 % on the NAACP ’s Annual Congressional Report Card .

Byrd is the embodiment of the Democratic establishment .
His endorsement of Obama is another sign that the Party considers the primary race over .
Hillary Clinton can still campaign , but the Democratic Party is moving on and gearing up for the fall campaign .
Byrd probably wo n’t be able to turn the tide for Obama in West Virginia , but if you ’re Obama , it never hurts to have a beloved state incumbent on your side .

Today , America ’s increasing obsession with health and wellness may be contributing to the rise of clothing - optional vacations .
“ Americans have moralized healthy bodies , ” said Dacher Keltner , a professor of psychology at the University of California at Berkeley , who has studied moral emotion and judgment .
He added that “ a case could be made that people are traveling to these places to be pure for moral reasons  to achieve harmony in nature . ”
It ’s really a form of self - expression , he added , that dates back to Walt Whitman and John Muir , as well as Thoreau , all of whom advocated being as true to yourself as possible .
“ The truest you can be is taking off those clothes , ” he said .
Suzann Zane , a 26 - year - old bartender from Baltimore , decided to try her first nude vacation this year  a weekend getaway in January to the Avalon Resort in Paw Paw , W. Va.  partly because of her interest in getting back to nature .
“ I consider myself a minimalist , ” said Ms. Zane .
“ With this big societal push for becoming green , we need to kind of get back to our roots and I thought maybe this would be a good way . ”
The first clue that this would be a different kind of vacation came on the drive up the long winding road to Avalon .
The first sign Ms. Zane said she spotted was one that posted the speed limit at 7 m.p.h .
The second announced , “ Beyond this point you will encounter nudity . ”
When Susan Sullivan , 42 , from New Jersey , visited her first nudist resort last year with her boyfriend , John Sheilds , 55 , she said she had to warm up to the idea of disrobing in front of strangers by draping a towel over her body when she first went outdoors .
But after a short while , she too lost any inhibitions .
“ You come to the realization you ’re looking at those people , you ’re not staring at people .
They ’re not staring at you . ”
SpaFinder ’s chief executive , Pete Ellis , theorizes that the increase of spas at resorts has influenced the growing acceptance of nudity .
After all , disrobing for a massage has become a routine vacation ritual for many travelers .
Even the staid Canyon Ranch Resort in Tucson , Ariz. , has nude sunbathing decks off both the women ’s and men ’s locker rooms with an unlimited supply of sunscreen .
Warm - weather resorts from Palm Springs to Miami Beach to the Caribbean say they are seeing ( and turning a blind eye to ) more topless sunbathing at their pools and beaches as the strength of the euro brings more Europeans , and their more relaxed attitude toward nudity , on vacations to this country .
So many European guests were sunbathing topless on the beach at Starfish Trelawny , an all - inclusive family resort in Jamaica , that the resort put up a bamboo fence at the eastern end of its beach a few years ago to keep conservative guests happy and teenage boys from gawking .
And Shan Kanagasingham , the general manager at The Tides , in South Beach , recalls her first stay at the hotel when she got the job about a year ago .
“ When I checked in for the first time to the Tides  and I ’m not making this up  I opened the window and looked out , and all I saw was this sea of breasts and people walking around in G - strings . ”
The spa at the Parker Palms Springs , which opened about two years ago , offers separate men’s and women ’s areas each with pools and relaxation areas , all of which can be used in the nude .
“ And trust me , they are , ” said Marisa Zafran , the hotel ’s spokeswoman .

Mayoral turnout low
It 's hard to know when stuff like this has any meaning , but 19 mayors does n't sound like great turnout for today 's " 100 Mayors for Hillary " event .
And speaking of mid-level elected officials , Hillary had trouble getting the attention of Philadelphia Democratic party types last night .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
The head of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation waded into a sensitive British security debate on Monday by arguing strongly in favor of the use of phone - tap evidence to prosecute terrorist suspects .

Almost alone among Western countries , Britain does not allow suspects ’ telephone conversations , intercepted by the police or the MI5 intelligence agency , to be presented as evidence to a trial jury .
The government last year announced a review of the policy but has yet to say whether it will change it .
“ I know that is a debate here , ” FBI Director Robert Mueller told London ’s Chatham House think - tank , describing the use of intercepts in court as “ tremendously beneficial ” .
“ Some of the best evidence you get are the words coming out of the mouths of those who are being prosecuted .
I understand some of the ups and downs on that but you really put your intelligence and law enforcement services in a bind ” by ruling such evidence inadmissible , he said .
For the authorities , Mueller said , this meant that “ you have to continue with the ongoing threat until such time as you get admissible information ” .
They then had to “ hope and pray ” that police searches after the arrest of suspects yielded enough evidence to complete a prosecution case , which Mueller called “ an untenable situation in my mind ” .
The British government announced a review of the current law last June , but Prime Minister Gordon Brown told parliament on February 1 it had found that “ further extensive work ” was needed to see how intercept material could be used without jeopardizing sensitive techniques or draining resources .
British law does allow the use in court of material gathered by bugging suspects ’ homes or vehicles , but not from tapping their phones .
Mueller ’s comments , to an audience including the head of MI5 , came in response to a questioner who asked how the United States was able to combat terrorism with a legal system that allows law enforcement officers just two days to question suspects before charging them .
Britain allows police to hold suspects up to 28 days before charges are made .
The government wants to increase this to 42 in extreme situations , for example involving complex plots with extensive overseas links .
Apart from the intercept issue , Mueller cited the use of plea bargaining to persuade suspects to divulge intelligence on cells and plots .
“ There is not a terrorist group that we have taken down since September 11 ( 2001 ) in which one or more of them have not decided to cooperate .
And from that cooperation comes a vast pool of intelligence , ” he said .
Dodd to Dems : Find a way to end the race
In an interview with National Journal , the Connecticut senator — and Obama superdelegate — urges the Democratic Party to figure out a way to end the race as it drags into spring :
[ L]ook , we ’ve got a contest coming up in Pennsylvania and one in North Carolina and Indiana very quickly afterwards .
In my view , the outcome of those three races will determine — I think the race has been determined , anyway , at this point .
I think it ’s very difficult to imagine how anyone can believe that Barack Obama ca n’t be the nominee of the party .
I think that ’s a foregone conclusion , in my view , at this juncture given where things are .
But certainly over the next couple of weeks , as we get into April , it seems to me then that the national leadership of this party has to stand up and reach a conclusion .
And in the absence of doing that — and that ’s not easy and I realize it ’s painful — but the alternative , allowing this sort of to fester over the months of June and July and August , I think are irresponsible .
I think you have to make a decision , and hopefully the candidates will respect it and people will rally behind a nominee that , I think , emerges from these contests over the next month .
That ’s my suggestion .
That ’s what I would do .
My Road to Erlang
I had three or four job offers my last semester of college , all of them with telecom companies just north of Dallas .
I ended up working for Ericsson in the early 1990s .
Now if you 're expecting me to talk about how I hung around with the brilliant folks who developed Erlang ... do n't .
Ericsson 's telephone exchanges were programmed in a custom , baroque language called PLEX .
Syntactically it was a cross between Fortran and a macro assembler .
You could n't pass parameters to functions , for example ; you assigned them to variables instead , much like the limited GOSUB of an 8 - bit BASIC .
The advantage was that there was a clean one - to - one correspondence between the source code and the generated assembly code , a necessity when it came to writing patches for live systems where taking them down for maintenance was Very Bad Indeed .
The other thing worth mentioning about PLEX and Ericsson 's hardware of the time is that they were custom designed for large scale message passing concurrency .
That hardware created in the 1970s and 1980s was built to handle tens of thousands of processes certainly makes dual core CPUs seem a bit late to the party .
Ericsson had a habit of periodically sending employees to the mothership in Sweden , and after one such trip my office mate brought back a sheet of paper with a short , completely unintelligible to me , Erlang program on it .
In three years at Ericsson , my total exposure to Erlang was about thirty seconds .
I left shortly after that , getting back into game development .
In 1998 I started looking at very high level programming languages , because I was in a rut and getting behind the times .
Most of my experience was in various assembly languages ( 6502 , 68000 , 8086 , SH2 , PowerPC ) , C , Pascal , plus some oddities like Forth .
The only modern language I was familiar with was Perl , so like everyone else at the time I could write CGI scripts .
I wanted to leapfrog ahead , to get myself out of the low - level world , so I looked to functional programming ( covered a bit more in the first part of Admitting that Functional Programming Can Be Awkward ) .
I worked through online tutorials for three languages : Standard ML , OCaml , and Haskell .
I had fun with them , especially OCaml , but there were two glaring issues that held me back .
The first was that the tutorials were self - absorbed in the accoutrements of functional programming : type systems , fancy ways of using types for generic programming , lambda calculus tricks like currying .
The tutorials for all three languages were surprisingly similar .
The examples were either trivial or geared toward writing compilers .
At the time I was interested in in complex , interactive programs -- video games -- but I did n't have a clue about how to structure even the simplest of games in Haskell .
There were a few trivial games written in OCaml , but they made heavy use of imperative features which made me wonder what the point was .
The second issue was that I was used to working on commercial products , and there was little evidence at the time that Standard ML , OCaml , or Haskell was up to the task .
Would they scale up to programs orders of magnitude larger than class assignments ?
And more critically , would functional programming scale up ?
Would I hit a point when the garbage collector crossed the line from imperceptible to perceptible ?
Would there be anything I could possibly do if that happened ?
Would lazy evaluation become too difficult to reason about ?
There was also the worry that Windows seemed to be a " barely there " platform in the eyes of all three language maintainers .
The OCaml interpreter had a beautiful interactive shell under MacOS , but the Windows version was -- or should have been - - a great embarrassment to everyone involved .
Somewhere in this period I also took a hard look at Lisp ( I was one of the first registered users of Corman Lisp ) and Erlang .
Erlang was n't open source yet and required a license for commercial use .
The evaluation version still used the old JAM runtime instead of the more modern BEAM and was dog slow .
It also had the same dated , cold , industrial feeling of the systems I used when at Ericsson .
I put it aside and kept tinkering elsewhere .
But I came back when the move to open source occurred .
Here 's why :
I found I had an easier time writing programs in Erlang .
I was focused entirely on the mysterious concept of writing code that did n't involve destructive updates .
I was n't distracted by type systems or complex module and class systems .
The lack of " let " and " where " clauses in Erlang makes code easier to structure , without the creeping indentation caused by numerous levels of scope .
Atoms are a beautiful data type to work with .
That the tools had been used to ship large - scale commercial products gave me faith in them .
Yes , they are cold and industrial , and I started seeing that as a good thing .
The warts and quirks are there for a reason : because they were needed in order to get a project out the door .
I 'll take pragmatism over idealism any day .
Besides being useful in its own right , concurrency is a good pressure valve for functional programming .
Too difficult to puzzle out how to make a large functional program work ?
Break it into multiple smaller programs that communicate .
Speed was much improved .
The BEAM runtime is 3 x faster than JAM .
When I started looking at different languages , I was obsessed with performance , but I eventually realized I was limiting my options .
I could always go back to the madness of writing assembly code if I cared that much .
Flexibility mattered more .
The 3 x improvement pushed Erlang from " kinda slow " to " good enough . "
I 've been using Erlang since 1999 , but I hardly think of myself as a fanatic .
I still use Perl , Python , C++ , with occasional forays into REBOL , Lua , and Forth , plus some other special purpose languages .
They all have strengths and weaknesses .
But for most difficult problems I run into , Erlang is my first choice .

NEW YORK’S streets are as gritty as the city ’s reputation , traffic - clogged canyons of concrete where New Yorkers , on foot and in vehicles , jostle and growl , exulting all the while .
Stared down a Hummer lately ?
Yet there is a growing desire to tame New York ’s 5,800 miles of streets , sidewalks and highways , which constitute the city ’s principal social space .
The most highly publicized effort is Mayor Bloomberg ’s congestion pricing proposal , which was approved by the City Council on Monday and as of Friday evening was awaiting a vote by the State Legislature .
But ideas for calming New York ’s historically hectic streets go far beyond congestion pricing .
Those ideas , moreover , seem to signal a shift in the basic thinking of what streets are for .
“ For decades , the Department of Transportation ’s job has been to move vehicles as quickly as possible , ” said Janette Sadik - Khan , the agency ’s commissioner .
“ We ’re taking a look at it a little bit differently now .
There is a tremendous hunger for what we can do to make it easier for people to get around , to improve the quality of our streets and plazas , to make it easier for people to linger . ”
These street reformers  planners , architects and urban officials from around the globe  are questioning the conventional street - curb - sidewalk motif , challenging the dominance of cars , and devising ways to use street furniture , plants and even radical new vehicles to transform the experience of the street .
First , there were growing reports of school children being underfed and not getting enough calories , fats and sugars to enable them to grow well and learn , as a result of efforts to feed them ‘ healthy ’ foods .
Now , an investigation of nursery preschools has uncovered tragic findings : nearly all nurseries are feeding toddlers so little fat and calories , and such excessive amounts of ' healthy ' fiber , fruits and vegetables , that they are putting the children at risk for stunted growth and nutritional deficiencies .
Mistaken beliefs about healthy eating are now endangering our youngest children .
A terribly disturbing study was released a few weeks ago by Trading Standards , which says it is responsible for enforcing the UK ’s food legislation and ‘ healthy eating ’ agenda .
The media widely portrays — and it is popularly believed — that children are eating vast amounts of fats , sugars , salts and calories and nearly no fruits and vegetables .
Nutritional analyses were done on a week ’s worth of meals served in every nursery preschool in East Sussex , expecting to confirm these unhealthy eating practices and support the government ’s ‘ healthy eating ’ initiatives .
Amelia Hill of the Observer was the only reporter to write about the findings and the concerns raised in this investigative study .
We ’ll begin with her article .
As she notes , adult guidelines have recommended diets high in fiber , low in fat , with plenty of fruits and vegetables as the principles of healthy eating .
However ...
Fruit and veg diet ' danger for toddlers '
... nurseries are being told the food they serve in accordance with these guidelines is unsuitable for toddlers and could lead to vitamin deficiencies and even stunted growth .
' Nurseries are applying the principles of adult healthy eating to the food they are supplying to young children , ' said Sarah Almond , a consultant specialist paediatric dietician who has analysed the results of a trading standards study into nursery food .
' We expected the study to show nurseries were serving children food that was too high in calories , fat , saturated fat and salt , and low in vegetables and fruit .
Instead , we found that the majority of nurseries had gone to the other extreme and appeared to be providing food that was too low in calories , fat and saturated fat , and too high in fruit and vegetables . '
This situation was putting children at the risk of developing nutritional deficiencies , she said .
The research also found that four out of five nurseries were giving children portions that were too small and only three in 10 provided them with meals containing enough calories .
According to Almond ... pre-school children have a high energy and nutrient requirement .
Because they have a small stomach and a relatively under - developed gut , they cannot consume large quantities of food at a time but need frequent small meals and snacks throughout the day .
In addition , too much fibre - such as that absorbed through over - consumption of fruit and vegetables - can result in insufficient intake of other food groups and inhibit the absorption of key minerals .
' Because a significant number of children attend nurseries from 7 am until 7 pm , the food and nutrition they receive there are key to their health , ' said Almond ...
A campaign director at the Preschool Learning Alliance told the Observer that “ the majority of nurseries are confused or misinformed about what entails healthy eating ... over - focusing on the message about eating five portions of fruit and vegetable a day . ”
Most childcare workers , parents and even policy makers do n’t realize that growing children have vital needs for calories , fats , carbohydrates , sugars , protein and other nutrients .
The seriousness of the dangers for toddlers revealed in these nutritional analyses went beyond the fact that 7 out of the 10 nurseries were not even giving the toddlers enough calories to eat .
Energy their bodies need from sugars .
All but 2 of the nurseries were not providing even the minimal amounts of fats the children need for healthy neurological and brain development .
It also appears meat and fortified cereals were mostly eliminated from the menus and all of the nurseries failed to meet basic requirements for iron , for example .
Protein was similarly inadequate and only three of the nurseries even offered tuna fish or some type of fish even once a week .
These findings are believed to be an accurate reflection of the national picture .
The results even troubled Councilor Bob Tidy , Lead Cabinet Member for Community Services .
In a public statement he said nurseries “ have to change their thinking about what constitutes healthy eating for the under fives . ”
They face difficulties making the needed changes , however , he said , because of “ having to accommodate the demands of parents , who often have very specific viewpoints of what they will and will not allow their children to consume and their own perceptions of healthy eating which may not be appropriate for children of this age group . ”
As Fiona MacRae wrote today in the Daily Mail , “ in today ’s health - obsessed society , parents are made to feel guilty if they do not feed their children a diet packed with fiber - rich fruits and vegetables . ”
These are the ‘ healthy ’ foods that young parents are being told their toddlers “ should ” be eating .
These are also precisely the types of diets of concern to growing numbers of pediatric medical professionals who are seeing increasing numbers of children suffering nutritional shortfalls , failing to thrive and falling behind on growth , as a result of unsupported beliefs about healthy eating .
Parents are restricting fats , sugars , salts and calories and increasing fruits and vegetables , wrongly believing they can prevent their children from becoming fat or developing heart disease and becoming junkfood dependent .
Sadly , these diets do none of those things , nor are they healthy for children .
Very few parents of toddlers have probably ever heard that the National Academy of Sciences has recommended children get as much as 40 % fat in their diets every day , or that high fiber , low - calorie diets do n’t enable young children to get the calories they need , and high - fiber diets inhibit the absorption of many nutrients .
The intense marketing of ‘ healthy ’ foods to parents and daycare centers and preschools may be the most disturbing revelation of just how pervasive unsound nutrition information has become .
High - fiber drinks for toddlers
High - fiber fruit drinks are being marketed to parents — with a special discount program for daycare centers and preschools — as being “ healthier drink options for young children . ”
Developed by food scientists at the International Food Network at Cornell , these high fiber drinks are promoted as providing “ all the benefits of organic whole grains and 100 % fruit juice . ”
They ’re said to be better than juice or milk because they provide “ fiber and whole grain nutrients . ”
The promotional material claims :
Whole grains and fiber have been clinically proven to prevent heart disease and cancers .
With the obesity epidemic raging in our youth , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , diabetes and cancers are showing up in children at younger and younger ages .
Adopting nutritionally sound eating habits from the start that include the incorporation of more whole grains in the diet of children throughout the day will set them on the path for better lifelong health .
These drinks are reconstituted fruit juice , sweetened with “ organic brown rice syrup ” and supplemented with rice bran for fiber .
There is no evidence to recommend high - fiber bran for toddlers or , as we 've examined at length , that such diets in young children will prevent obesity or adult - onset chronic diseases of aging .
Calorie counting for toddlers
Or , perhaps you caught the unsettling health news on television or the syndicated article this past week promoting “ Calorie Bargains for Babies , Toddlers and Children . ”
Calorie counting for babies !
The story featured low - calorie , ‘ healthy ’ foods , such as a high - fiber energy bar containing organic fruits and vegetables , brown rice syrup and grains ( $ 14.49 for 12 bars ) .
The news story also promoted “ Itsy Bitsy Yoga ” for 18 months to 5 years of age — a program of 50 yoga poses for tiny tots that the author promises will ensure “ fewer tantrums , better and longer sleep , increased motor coordination , improved listening and ability to follow directions , better self - expression , higher self - esteem and easier relaxation . ”
As JFS readers are well familiar , there is no evidence or any expert medical body that recommends calorie - counting diets for babies , toddlers and preschoolers , nor supports the claims made for baby yoga .
The story was written by a diet book author and personal trainer who founded Integrated Wellness Solutions .
According to its website , it creates online software that integrates the “ latest scientific and behavioral nutritional research and ... is used by insurance companies , pharmaceutical companies and other large corporations . ”
With so much unsound information about healthy eating surrounding parents today and so many interests eager to cash in on the healthy eating movement , it ’s little wonder that young parents have been swept up .
But , it is n’t ' junkfood ' that most threatens the physical and psychological health and wellbeing of children today .
Tragically , it appears to be the so - called ‘ healthy ’ stuff .
It is appropriate to lambaste Apple for selling their product — hardware — with a non-free OS pre-installed .

I admit , I do n’t fully understand where Jeff is coming from when he says “ When you buy a new Mac , you 're buying a giant hardware dongle that allows you to run OS X software .
” Apple is not in the operating system business .
Apple is in the hardware business .
Steve Jobs famously said that Apple views itself as a software company .
And indeed , they do a great job of writing software .
But nevertheless , they are in the hardware business : that ’s where they get the overwhelming majority of their revenues .
Put in that light , the licensing restrictions on the operating systems that come pre-installed on their hardware are exactly the same as the licensing restrictions on the operating systems that come pre-installed in Windows PCs from manufacturers like Dell and Sony Arguing that we ought to be able to install OS X on a white box PC is analogous to arguing that we ought to be able to purchase a Sony Vaio , then take the OEM copy of Windows off the laptop and install it on a white box laptop .
Or that we ought to be able to purchase an upgrade copy of Windows and install it on a white box PC .
I say upgrade copy , because the standalone copies of OS X for sale are licensed for upgrades only , not for new machines .
People who think of the argument as being Apple vs.
Microsoft think of the two companies as being in the OS business .
But Apple is not in the OS business , and has n’t been in that business since Jobs returned and quickly killed the OEM Macintosh market .
Think of an iPod touch .
Would anybody argue that when you buy an iPod you are buying a copy of OS X with a dongle that happens to play music attached to it ?
Seriously ?
is anybody complaining that they can’t transfer their copy of OS X from an iPod touch to whatever lame music player Microsoft is peddling this week ?
A dongle exists to prevent you from using a piece of software twice without paying for it twice .
Apple is hardly even trying to prevent you from using OS X twice without paying for it twice .
I can demonstrate this for you : I have a copy of Leopard .
There is no copy protection on it .
It does not phone home .
Why is that ?
Ah !
It is because it is only supposed to run on Apple hardware .
Exactly .
If Apple lose a few sales of Leopard to Macintosh owners that illegally copy Leopard , that is too bad but it is no big deal to them .
Of course , if you hack it to run on non-Apple hardware , you are going to wind up on a first - name basis with Apple ’s lawyers .
That ’s because — are you tired of hearing me say this ?
— they are in the hardware business , not the operating system business .
In that light , it is appropriate to lambaste them for selling their product — hardware — with a non-free OS pre-installed .
However , they offer the exact same Freedom Zero as the PCs you can buy from Dell .
You can modify them without incurring Apple ’s wrath .
You can install another operating system on them , even Windows .
It ’s true that their hardware is bundled with non-free software , and that ’s too bad .
But the product they sell — hardware — is free of encumbrances .
If you want to compare and contrast them , compare them to another hardware company Dell :
In addition to selling hardware with non-free operating systems , Dell also sells hardware with Linux pre-installed I could end this with a cheap shot about Microsoft only selling non-free products , but I wo n’t .
I can’t .
The point here is that comparing Apple to Microsoft is almost completely meaningless in this context , because Apple is a company in the hardware business that happens develop and bundle an insanely great — but non -free — OS with their hardware .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
The gun carried by a US Airways pilot accidentally went off on a flight from Denver to Charlotte on Saturday , causing the plane to be pulled from service , the airline said on Monday .
No one was injured by the shot , and the aircraft landed safely in Charlotte .
Flight 1536 had 124 passengers , two pilots and three flight attendants aboard , US Airways said .
The pilot was a Federal Flight Deck Officer , permissioned by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to carry a firearm .
While the cat has been away in Iraq , the mice have been at play here in the United States .
More like rats than mice , actually , they 've set up one of the worst traps in American history .
And we are all about to drive right into it .
The latest rat trap goes by the vaguely pornographic name Interstate 69 .
I - 69 is a massive superhighway that already extends from Ontario to Indianapolis ( through Michigan ) , with plans to resume construction next spring and push through southern Indiana , Kentucky , Tennessee , Mississippi , Arkansas , Louisiana and Texas , where it will connect with the highways of the Plan Puebla Panama in Mexico .
Meanwhile , another part of this " Super Corridor " called Interstate 35 has been expanding from Winnipeg to Mexico , through North and South Dakota , Nebraska , Wyoming , Oklahoma and Texas .
All this asphalt â€ ” pollution , impervious surface , drained wetlands , traffic , and so on â€ ” is courtesy NAFTA , the North American Free Trade Agreement .
I - 69 and I - 35 will be the major artery of globalization in the Americas â€ ” an aorta through our heartland four football fields - wide .
The road has already gobbled up hundreds of thousands of acres of undeveloped , pristine habitat , and displaced families through eminent domain " takings . "
When it 's completed , it will profoundly reshape the Americas , gutting regions and , in Central America , cultures , while leading to more dam projects , clear cutting of forests , etc .
In addition , this " corridor " will require $ 2 billion per year of public funds for " infrastructure improvements . "
The push for Interstates 69 and 35 has been brutal , driven by the greed of a few corporations that cowed Congress into funding this boondoggle while also destroying Amtrak and bleeding our railroads and public transportation projects dry .
However , it would be unfair to call this " capitalism . "
The money used to build it is public ; thus , it would be closer to the truth to equate this to a Soviet " Five Year Plan . "
And it would not be too far off the mark to describe America 's current political system as a totalitarian corporate state .
You may not like the cold - bloodedness of this language , but to call it anything else is playing the semantic spin game that Bush and Cheney have learned so well ( Clear Skies Initiative for " gut air pollution regulations , " Operation Enduring Freedom for " invade another country and steal their oil , " etc. ) .
Not since the Gilded Age , when the railroads blazed the trail across the girth of the nation â€ ” stealing Indian lands and blasting through majestic landscapes â€ ” has a government - sanctioned transportation project of this scale been attempted .
Think about it .
The biggest highway in the nation is being built after we 've already reached peak oil , after the usefulness of a road - centric paradigm has run its course .
Further , in the areas through which it is planned , no one wants it but a handful of corporate con men slurping at the public trough .
Public hearings and protests have occurred along the route of Interstate - 69 , but they have had no effect at stemming this massive boondoggle .
The lazy press has spun the corporate framing narrative â€ ” that the superhighway 's " inevitable " and any efforts by to stop it are " futile . "
Activists are portrayed as " eco radicals " and shoved aside , or jailed , for minor infractions that are inevitable when crowds of protesters gather .
Meanwhile , the " business community " hails the false panacea of " economic development . "
You should educate yourself about this road , this not - so - Super Highway .
After all , you are helping to pay for it .

So apparently Hillary Clinton was " sleep - deprived " when she forgot that she 'd never dodged sniper fire while running from a plane in Tuzla .
All " misspoke " theories of the case seem to me to founder on the fact that the version of the story that got her caught was only the most extreme version of a narrative of danger she 's mentioned repeatedly throughout the campaign .
But maybe we have an explanation of her war vote -- maybe she was sleep - deprived when she authorized the war ?
Maybe she 's been staying up all night studying the classified National Intelligence Estimate trying to get to the bottom of things ?
Well , okay , she was n't doing that , but maybe it was something .
Presumably her plan is to be well - rested during her freaky 3 AM phone calls .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

After ' losing Fallujah , ' US media ' mends military fences '
RAW STORY
Published : Monday January 7 , 2008

This A shift in war coverage has helped mend relations between the United States military and the media , according to an article in Monday 's New York Times .
" The anguished relationship between the military and the news media appears to be on the mend as battlefield successes from the troop increase in Iraq are reflected in more upbeat news coverage , " Thom Shankar reports .
" Efforts from the new Pentagon leadership , as well as by top commanders at the headquarters in Baghdad , have also eased tensions between reporters and those in uniform . "
Shankar writes that " dozens " of interviews conducted with military officers stationed in Iraq revealed a consensus opinion that media coverage of the war is now being presented in a fairer light .
" It is obvious that many of the stories in print and television now have a more positive tenor ; it ties directly to what is happening on the ground , " Lt. Col .
James Hutton , a public affairs officer for Multinational Corps - Iraq , told the paper .
" Im satisfied that the majority of reporters on the ground want to get the story right and are responsive when their reporting is seen as less than accurate and we call them on it . "
The Times piece comes on the heels of a newly revealed US Army assessment of 2004 military actions in Fallujah , a study which found that media portrayal of the battle in part contributed to US forces ' withdrawal from the town .
" The outcome of a purely military contest in Fallujah was always a foregone conclusion  coalition victory , " stated the assessment from the Army 's National Ground Intelligence Center .
" But Fallujah was not simply a military action , it was a political and informational battle .
...
The effects of media coverage , enemy information operations and the fragility of the political environment conspired to force a halt to U.S. military operations . "
As reported by United Press International , the assessment added that " the decision to order an immediate assault on Fallujah , in response to the televised killing of four contractors from the private military firm Blackwater , effectively prevented the Marine Expeditionary Force charged with retaking the town from carrying out ' shaping operations , ' such as clearing civilians from the area , which would have improved their chances of success . "
The study called the press " crucial to building political pressure to halt military operations . "
An Investor 's Business Daily editorial last week agreed with the military 's view .
" In fact , the U.S. Marines entering Fallujah did take casualties and met heavy armed resistance , " said the paper .
" But without the misleading media coverage that led to political pressure , they would have almost certainly cleaned out what had become a viper 's nest of terrorist activity . "

Letterman and McCain trade barbs on the ' Late Show '
Presidential candidate Senator John McCain took a detour from the campaign trail to stop in for an appearance on the ' Late Show ' with David Letterman Tuesday evening .
It began with Letterman , in his monologue , making some of his trademark McCain - looks - like - a - cranky - old - man jokes .
" He looks like the guy who goes into town for turpentine .
He looks like the guy who always has wiry hair growing out of new places .
He looks like the guy who points out the spots they missed at the car wash . "
Then Senator McCain walks out on stage .
" Hi , Letterman , " he said .
" You think that stuff 's pretty funny , do n't you ? "
Then Mr. McCain unleashed a slew of his own you - look - like - a - guy jokes at Mr. Letterman .
" Well , you look like a guy whose laptop would be seized by the authorities , " McCain said .
" You look like a guy caught smuggling reptiles in his pants . "
Letterman interjected : " Do n't knock it if you have n't tried it . "
McCain continued : " You look like the guy who the neighbors later say , ' He mostly kept to himself . '
You look like the night manager of a creepy motel . "
" Well , that 's what I need , " Letterman said .
Then the Arizona Senator gets in the final zinger : " And you look like the guy who enjoys getting into a hot tub and watching his swim trunks inflate . "
The two Democratic candidates have also appeared on the CBS show this year - Hillary Rodham Clinton in February , and Barack Obama in January .

In a slow - motion shock to environmentalists worldwide , European countries are turning back to coal to fire new power plants .
At a time when India and China are ramping up production in their outdated coal - burning facilities , the last place anyone expected to see a coal resurgence was in the generally progressive nations of Western Europe .
Most turning again to coal are hamstrung by record oil and natural gas prices ; Italy and Germany have the added stress of having banned new nuclear plants as an alternative .
Coal is relatively cheap and widely available , both features absent from oil and natural gas .
The global reserves are much deeper as well .

ATLANTA , April 23 ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter denied on Wednesday that the State Department warned him not to meet with leaders of the Islamist group Hamas before he made a recent trip to the Middle East .
Carter said Hamas ' top official Khaled Meshaal told him during meetings in Damascus on Friday and Saturday that Hamas would " accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders if approved by Palestinians . "
The United States brushed off the comments on Monday , arguing that Hamas ' basic stance , which includes a call in its charter for the destruction of Israel , had not changed .
The State Department has said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State David Welch , the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East , urged Carter not to meet with Hamas , a position restated by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , but Carter denied this .
" No one in the State Department or any other department of the U.S. government ever asked him ( Carter ) to refrain from his recent visit to the Middle East or even suggested that he not meet with Syrian President ( Bashar ) Assad or leaders of Hamas , " said a statement released by the Atlanta - based Carter Center , which speaks on the former president 's behalf .
Hamas , which controls Gaza , is viewed as a terrorist organization by the United States , the European Union and Israel .
The Carter Center statement said the former president attempted to call Rice before making the trip and a deputy returned his call since Rice was in Europe .
" They had a very pleasant discussion for about 15 minutes , during which he never made any of the negative or cautionary comments described above .
He never talked to anyone else , " the Carter Center statement said .
" President Carter has the greatest respect for ...
Rice and believes her to be a truthful person .
However , perhaps inadvertently , she is continuing to make a statement that is not true , " the statement said .
Carter 's reference to the 1967 borders spoke of the West Bank and Gaza Strip , which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War , and to a referendum on a peace deal Washington hopes to clinch this year .
Hamas won a 2006 election and briefly formed a unity government with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
It seized control of Gaza from Abbas ' secular Fatah faction in fighting in June .
Hamas has refused to accept major conditions laid down by the quartet of Middle East peace mediators .
Those nations include the United States , Russia , the United Nations and the European Union .

You never really know what all will emerge from a simple interview , and thanks to a recent sit - down with Canonical chief executive Mark Shuttleworth , we now know that a build of Ubuntu tailored for ultraportables ( or subnotes , as it were ) is just around the bend .
According to Mr. Shuttleworth , the aforesaid software will be announced " in the first week of June , " and it'll be called the Netbook Remix .
He also noted that the outfit is currently " working with Intel , which produces chips custom - made for this sector . "
Sadly , it seems we 'll have to wait a week or so before finding out more , but those interested in reading the interview in full can certainly give the read link a visit .

2011年4月からちょうど3年半働いていた東京オフィスを離れて、2014年10月にアメリカの本社の同じチームに転勤しました。
正確に はNew York Cityの隣 のJersey Cityというところで働いています。New Yorkと言ったほうがわかりやすいのでNew Yorkに転勤と言っています。
東京のチームは小さかったので、会社内でうちのチームが提供している社内システムのサポートと開発を半々ぐらいにやっていました。うちのチームの東京オフィスはずいぶん特殊で、「広く浅く」業務の端から端まで見渡して、ユーザが困っているところを助けたり、PerlやJavaでいろいろなものを実装していました。労働環境は素晴らしく、同僚や同期にも恵まれてとても充実した社会人生活を送っていましたが、より「狭く深く」ソフトウェア開発業務に専念したいという思いがありました。
このことをしばらく前から東京やNew Yorkにいる上司に相談していて、このたび本社のチームの都合がつくとのことで転勤となりました。これまで主に電話でやりとりしていたチームメイトと対面でプロダクトのデザインやトラブルシューティングのことを話すことができ非常に働きやすいです。生活面でもドル建ての銀行口座やクレジットカードを作ったり、レストランの注文が意味不明だったり、部屋を契約したりとずっと日本で生活してきた自分にとって新鮮なことばかりで楽しいです。
この年になりながら日々新しいことに挑戦できるのは幸せなことです。頑張ります。

More forced to stay in Army
Policy counter to Gates ' 2007 order to Pentagon
WASHINGTON — The Army has accelerated its policy of involuntary extensions of duty to bolster its troop levels , despite Defense Secretary Robert Gates ' order last year to limit it , Pentagon records show .
Gates directed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the service secretaries to minimize mandatory tour extensions , known as " stop loss , " in January 2007 .
By May , the number of soldiers affected by the policy had dropped to a three - year low of 8,540 .
Since then , the number of soldiers forced to remain in the Army rose 43 % to 12,235 in March .
The reliance on stop loss has increased as the military has sent more troops to Iraq and extended tours to 15 months to support an escalation in U.S. forces ordered by President Bush .
The increase last month was driven by the need to send more National Guard soldiers to Iraq .
Soldiers affected by stop loss now serve , on average , an extra 6.6 months , Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said .
Key leaders at the small - unit level — sergeants through sergeants first class — make up 45 % of those soldiers .
Soldiers usually enlist for four - year stints .
" Secretary Gates understands the hardship stop loss poses to our troops and their families , but he also understands the need to maintain cohesive units on the battlefield throughout deployment , " Morrell said .
" Troops who have trained together and fought together should remain together . "
The trend is alarming , said Rep. Christopher Shays , R - Conn. , who wrote a letter on April 17 to Gates urging him " in the strongest terms " to limit stop loss .
Shays says the policy hurts morale , burdens troops ' families , damages the credibility of military leaders and threatens recruiting .
Stop loss can keep a soldier in the service if his or her unit deploys within 90 days of the end of the soldier 's commitment .
It is necessary , the Army says , to maintain the integrity of units headed to war .
In all , 58,300 soldiers have been affected by stop loss since 2002 , according to the Army .
That 's about 1 % of active duty , Reserve and National Guard troops .
The policy shows the Army is " unraveling a bit " while " under tremendous strain , " said Rep. Joe Sestak , a Pennsylvania Democrat and retired vice admiral .
Lt. Gen. James Thurman , Pentagon deputy chief of staff for operations , said Monday that he hoped the Army could stop mandatory extensions by fall 2009 .
Although soldiers understand the reasons for stop loss , it does n't boost morale , said Robert Sauder , 24 , a staff sergeant retained in 2006 when he was preparing to leave the service .
Sauder , of Baroda , Mich. , said he " was pretty sour about the whole situation . "
Church uses $ 500 gas raffle to lure worshippers
SNELLVILLE , Ga. ( AP ) 
So much for spaghetti suppers :
The First Baptist Church of Snellville is fueling its membership drive with a sign in front of its sprawling campus proclaiming " Free Gasoline . "
There 's a catch , of course .
The offer is a not a giveaway .
Instead , each time newcomers or members attend a church event during a Sunday - to - Wednesday revival they get a pink raffle ticket for a chance to win one of two $ 500 gas cards .
" We do n't know how far it will go with these soaring prices , " said Rusty Newman , the church 's senior pastor .
" But it may make someone 's night . "
Newman 's congregation boasts roughly 9,000 members , but only about 2,500 regularly attend Sunday services .
The church , like others , has long relied on special dinners and giveaways to draw in members , but elders wanted something a little more timely for this latest pitch .
They set up a sign advertising the offer outside the church 's parking lot on a busy road near downtown Snellville , a traffic - clogged suburb northeast of Atlanta .
" How can we capture those people ? " asked James Lee , the church 's minister to seniors , who came up with the idea .
" We 're strong in door - to - door evangelism , but there 's no way to reach them all . "
Soon the calls came flooding in .
Church staffer Lisa Gauthier said she 's handled dozens of them each day , some from as far afield as Seattle .
Radio show hosts in Oregon caught wind of the idea and invited Newman on air .
So many inquiries came pouring in that Newman had to order a new phone line and dedicate a receptionist to answering each one .
Newman views it as a service to the community , and he 's looked to the Bible for his endorsement .
One passage he mentions to support his idea involves Jesus feeding 5,000 with a few loaves of bread and a couple of fish .
" Some pastors have questioned our motives , " Newman said .
" If it was just to get people in the building , it would be wrong .
But we want to meet someone 's physical need and eternal spiritual needs . "

Why Airlines Might Abandon Your City
In the near future , you might end up driving hours just to catch your flight .
April 30 , 2008  -- Nightmare Scenario # 1 : You 've got your briefcase in hand , boarding pass in pocket , and your carry - on rolling behind you .
You head to the airport with confidence .
Except — there are no planes there .
Sound crazy ?
Keep reading .
Nightmare Scenario # 2 : You jump in a cab , heading to the airport ; you know your airline is there , so no worries about any missing planes .
The only problem is , your cab ride to the nearest airport with flights takes four hours .
Impossible ?
Well , in today 's environment , it could happen .
Airlines are bailing out of certain cities and routes .
Your city could be next .
Today 's environment is key here :
We have a stumbling economy ( okay , it occasionally trips and falls , too ) ; currency is upside down ( great for the Brits who come to visit — not so great for the rest of us because , yes , you can pay $ 9 for a cup of coffee in London ) ; and let 's not forget those killer jet fuel costs .
Go ahead , call this a toxic environment ; few in the airline industry will disagree .
What the airlines are doing to stay " aflight " is raising prices and cutting back flights to make sure those price hikes stick .
You know all about the raising - prices - and - fees part ( American Airlines was the final airline to announce $ 25 to check a second bag ) ; but what might be more nefarious for many travelers , especially those in smaller cities with regional airports , is what one airline analyst tagged as an inevitable " mother of all capacity cuts " that will occur as legacy airlines begin to merge .
Deciding where to cut routes and cities is fairly easy ; airline bean - counters simply sort their city - pair spreadsheets by profitability , and those at the bottom are first on the hit list .
Naturally , they look at the number of passengers who travel in and out of the cities in question ( although , interestingly enough , if there are too few passengers , smaller airlines may qualify for federal subsidies — during 2006 , for example , Department of Transportation figures indicate subsidized Big Sky Airlines averaged just two passengers a day on its Lewiston to Billings , Mont. , route ) .
Unfortunately , even those subsidies were n't enough to keep Big Sky from going bust .
Another factor :
Do people in your town consider their passport to be just as important as a driver 's license ?
In other words , does your city have potential outbound international travelers , or whatever it takes to attract international passengers ?
This is important because , for a lot of the airlines , international travel is where the money is .
Delta Airlines , for example , has dropped a number of cities in recent months ( including Islip , N.Y. ; Bellingham , Wash . ; Fargo , N.D. , and Atlantic City , N.J. ) , and has made it clear their future expansion efforts will be overseas .
How else to determine if your city is at risk of airline deprivation ?
Easy .
One or more of your city 's airlines goes bankrupt .
We 've seen a lot of this lately , with the death of Aloha , Skybus , ATA and more .
Now , if this does happen in your stomping grounds , maybe another airline will come in and take over .
Or , more likely in this environment , they wo n't .
Remember , those " lower cost " airlines that would have eagerly gobbled up the leavings of a legacy carrier in past years , now face the same hard issues as the big boys .
Maybe to a lesser degree , but all the airlines are feeling that pinch .
Something else to consider :
Does your city subsidize an airline to help drive down overall prices ?
Wichita , Kan. , did ; the lucky recipient was airTran .
Then Wichita decided not to subsidize airTran .
AirTran left .
There 's a moral there , but maybe the citizens of Wichita are happy with their decision .
Finally , here 's where jet fuel comes in with a vengeance : What aircraft does the airline (s ) servicing your city fly ?
If it 's not fuel efficient enough , or the airline can't fill enough seats , they may just park those planes out in the desert , to sit in the sun because that may be a lot cheaper than flying those planes ( even if they are full ) once oil hits $ 140 a barrel or more .
By the way , seats are already disappearing .
The capacity cutbacks are being felt .
I consulted our historical flight schedules to compare U.S. domestic flights on a typical Monday in September 2007 with that same day in September this year ; I found that in 2007 that day , there were about 2.6 million seats in planes crisscrossing the United States .
But on that day this year , there will only be about 2.5 million seats .
That 's down about 4 percent , which is the equivalent of 570 daily flights by a 737 jetliner .
The good news is , Virgin America , Southwest and other lower cost carriers ( and Continental ) have added some seats .
The bad news is they have all said they wo n't be doing so for the foreseeable future and — even worse — Delta and US Airways are dropping more than twice as many seats as Virgin America and Southwest are adding , combined .
I also noticed a trend in the data that you 're probably already aware of if you have flown lately : the continued downsizing of domestic flights .
Airlines are dumping prop planes and narrow and mid-body planes like 717s , 737s , MD80s , DC - 9s , 757s , 767s and Airbus A320s in favor of 50 and 70 seat regional jets ( 70 being the most popular ) .
The best advice I can give in these trying times for air travel is to act like a boy scout — and be prepared for every eventuality in air travel , because you 're likely to run into a variety of painful situations .
We all know by now that when bad things happen with airlines , like route cut - backs , city cut - backs or even complete shut - downs , we , the passengers , seem to get as little notice as possible .

Despite economic slowdown , healthcare CEO 's bonuses are blooming RAW STORY

Print This Email This Even Bear Stearns chairman rides it out : a $ 25 million condo
Not everyone is feeling the pinch of the declining economy .
A New York Times piece Monday tells the tale of Paul Parmar , a 37 - year - old investor in health care , defense , luxury and media companies .
" In recent months , Mr. Parmar , who lives in Colts Neck , N.J. , said he bought 140 acres in Mineola , Tex. , and is spending $ 20 million to begin building a refuge there for abused tigers , " the Times notes .
" Since January , he said he added to his car collection with a $ 110,000 BMW 750 Li ( for his girlfriend ) and a Bentley Arnage for himself , for about $ 300,000 .
He is leasing a Maybach through Luxautica , an ' ultimate car club ' that has annual fees of about $ 125,000 . "
 On a spending level ,  Mr. Parmar said , speaking about a possible recession , it doesnt affect me at all .
That said , providers of luxury goods reported anecdotal evidence of a widening gap between the merely rich and the ultrarich .
Clifford Greenhouse , who owns a household - staff employment company , said he suspects that the merely rich might be starting to lag behind their far richer counterparts , and are trimming their budgets .
He cited reduced demand for chauffeurs  a relatively small - ticket service  yet ever - strong demand for private chefs , butlers and household managers .
Why ?
A little reported fact of the hemorrhaging US economy is that healthcare companies -- and more widely known -- defense contractors , are raking it in .
Just two weeks ago , Standard & Poor 's affirmed its ratings for health insurers Aetna Inc. , UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Cigna Corp. , " citing strong profit and competitive positions in the industry . "
Blue Cross & Blue Shield is also doing well , lavishing the parent of its Illinois CEO with massive bonuses for 2007 .
" Wellness , " penned the Chicago Business Journal last week , " the new marketing slogan of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois , also applies to the pocketbooks of the insurer 's top executives . "
Pay for almost all of the top 10 execs at the Blues ' Chicago - based parent , Health Care Service Corp. , at least doubled in 2007 thanks to hefty bonuses , a recent state filing shows .
Longtime CEO Raymond McCaskey 's $ 8.7 - million bonus pushed his total pay to $ 10.3 million , up 78 % from the previous year .
The top 10 execs made a combined $ 35.8 million last year , up 131 % from 2006
In a statement , the company defends the compensation , saying it allows it to " compete for and retain talented employees " ....
" Health insurers are paying huge amounts of money to top executives at a time when more and more middle - class families can't afford insurance , " says Jerry Flanagan , health care policy director at the California - based advocacy group Consumer Watchdog .
Mr. McCaskey 's pay alone " is enough to provide coverage to 3,500 individuals " for a year , he says .
Executive pay at Health Care Service , which had $ 14.35 billion in revenue last year , dwarfs that of most other companies that own Blue Cross subsidiaries .
Two large Blues plans in Pennsylvania , for example  each of which also ranks among the top 10 health insurers nationally , with about $ 9.5 billion in 2006 revenue apiece  paid their CEOs $ 3.7 million and $ 2.6 million last year .
Cigna 's CEO received $ 22.7 million in 2007 , AP reported last month .
" The chief executive of health insurer Cigna Corp. received a compensation package worth $ 22.7 million in 2007 , boosted by a big bonus awarded during a year of lackluster stock performance , according to a regulatory filing made late Friday , " AP said .
" H. Edward Hanway received a salary of $ 1.11 million , a performance - based bonus of nearly $ 18 million , and other perks worth $ 32,021 including the use of company aircraft .
He received $ 3.57 million worth of stock and option awards , the value on the day they were granted , a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed . "
This is up from $ 15.2 million in 2006 .
United Health , another profitable insurance company whose rating remained positive in the S&P 's recent review was remonstrated by physicians in an Apr. 4 article by the Wall Street Journal , where some " physicians who see the insurer as ironfisted in reimbursement and largely absent in communicating with doctors . "
Aetna stocks have slid this year , but the company maintains it will hit its profit expectations for 2008 .
Defense contractors are also posting growth .
In 2008 dollars , yearly expenditures top peaks reached during the Korean and Vietnam wars , and amount to three quarters of the peak reached during World War II -- which called for 10 times the number of troops -- according to SmartMoney.com associate editor Jack Hough .
" Accordingly , the stock value of America 's big defense contractors has swelled , on average , more than 150 % in five years , about triple the broad market 's gain , " Hough adds , in his April 10 piece , " War Lines Pockets of Defense - Stock Investors . "
Rich staying rich , and living well Across the country , those of multi-million dollar means may be feeling the pinch in the stock market , but it is n't keeping them from spending lavishly .
The multimillion and up housing market -- particularly in Manhattan and Miami Beach -- remains strong .
And it 's not just the rich who are rich that are doing well .
" Days before the collapse of Bear Stearns , the banks chairman , James E. Cayne , paid $ 25 million for a 14th - floor condo at the Plaza Hotel , " the New York Times ' Christine Haughney and Eric Konigsberg reveal Monday .
You might expect Cayne to be hiding from the financial crowd after Bear Stearn 's collapse .
He 's not .
He 's " invited to [ a ]
May 10 party at the Plaza , " Haughney and Konigsberg write .
" It will feature a dozen female string musicians made up to look like statues and clothed in dresses of fresh flowers , like roses and gardenias .
There will be caviar and Cognac bars , as well as a buffet designed to visually replicate 17th - century Dutch paintings from the recent Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibit ,  The Age of Rembrandt . 
Cayne stepped down to become non-executive chairman in January .
He will become " one of the bank 's top ' rainmakers , ' working with key clients on mergers and acquisitions and other high - profile deals , " according to the British Telegraph .
The paper documents the continued buying power of America 's powerful elite .
Real estate in Manhattan is n't suffering the woes of the subprime crisis hitting low - income and middle - class homeowners across the country .
Buyers have plucked up 71 apartments in the gilded city -- all of them priced over $ 10 million .
This compares with just 17 such units in 2007 .
" And the GoldBar , a downtown lounge , reports that bankers continue to order $ 3,000 bottles of Rémy Martin Louis XIII Cognac . "
Introduction
A few weeks ago , I learned Ruby and Ruby on Rails to compare them head - to - head against Python and Pylons , in preparation for a new project .
When I began , I knew nothing about Ruby or Ruby on Rails .
I have tried to be as objective as possible : before beginning this project , I wrote in email on March 5th :
I promise we ’ll be as objective as humanly possible ; if Ruby and Ruby on Rails truly is better , we ’ll happily use RoR and never look back .
I want to know that I ’m using the absolute best tool for the job .
Since then , I have reimplemented one complex nine - hundred line Python library , PottyMouth , in Ruby .
Another team member has also reimplemented parts the Pylons web application Spydentify in Ruby on Rails .
The best tool for the job is Python & Pylons .
While Rails and Pylons are similar , shortcomings in Ruby compared to Python make Python & Pylons the clear choice .
I make three basic arguments against using Ruby :
The language and its implementation are incomplete and immature .
Immature implementations breed performance issues .
A project loses time when it must implement missing or incomplete functionality .
The language is inconsistent and needlessly complex .
Inconsistency and complexity confuses people and confusion breeds bugs .
The documentation is incomplete .
Incomplete documentation breeds bugs as you might misuse a feature .
And a project slows down while you read the language or library source code , or ask the community for help with undocumented features .
I believe Ruby would fare poorly against other languages , not just Python , on these angles as well .
Why have Ruby and Ruby on Rails gained so much traction , despite these issues ?
Aside from the Rails hype , it ’s because they are not insurmountable issues .
It is possible to build a large application in Ruby ; many people have .
But any programmer building a large application in Ruby will have to deal with the issues listed here at some point .
These are all issues that do not appear right away .
A project does n’t face them until a website reaches maturity , develops lots of features , fields traffic from lots of users , or until a project hires programmers who are n’t Ruby experts or experienced enough to anticipate these issues .
My point is simply that Python ( and other languages ) , allow you to handle most of these issues more elegantly , or avoid them completely .
Subscribe here if you ’d like to be notified of any follow - up posts ( for an article this long , I ’m sure there will be a few ) , or if you ’d like to read my critiques , positive and negative , of other things technological .
Contents
Unicode and encodings
If you ’re already familiar with Ruby ’s problems with Unicode , feel free to skip this section .
Ruby did not have any support for Unicode character strings when it was originally released in 1996 .
This is only slightly silly for a language that was invented after Unicode 1.0 was released in 1992 .
It is inexcusably shortsighted that Ruby has not added Unicode objects over the last twelve years .
A third - party Ruby library for conversion ties into the Unix iconv program , allowing conversion between two different encodings .
However , converted strings are still sequences of bytes .
This means that using most of the string methods ( slice , reverse , size , index , downcase , upcase , strip ) and indexing into the string with [ ] notation do not work in non-ASCII encoded strings .
You can get the desired results out of these methods by first accessing the .chars attribute of non-ASCII strings .
This is less desirable because the programmer must remember to use .chars whenever he or she is working with non-ASCII strings .
A better solution would be to support first - class Unicode objects , as strings of Unicode characters , natively in the language .
There is a third - party Unicode support library that replaces Ruby ’s String class and adds Unicode support , but it is acknowledged to be hackish , potentially dangerous , and makes Ruby somewhat slower .
Unicode support may or may not be forthcoming in Ruby 2.0 .
There are certainly members of the community advocating it .
This means , among other things , that there is no built - in support in Rails ’ HTML generation , for converting Unicode characters to HTML entities .
This page details how to hack around this problem ; but this is something that should be automatic and built - in , not hacked around .
Python ’s built - in Unicode and encodings support , which is a first - class , native Unicode object and a full suite of built - in encodings , was introduced in Python 1.6 in 2000 .
It has evolved into an extremely reliable , secure and versatile Unicode implementation .
It is also extremely simple to use .
Python supports all of the encodings that Ruby supports via iconv , and a number that it does n’t , including Quoted - Printable , the encoding used for the vast majority of email messages , and MBCS , the encoding used by Windows FAT32 and NTFS file - systems .
Because Python ’s built - in Unicode support is so robust , the vast majority of Python libraries all convert to Unicode when accepting input , and convert to the proper encoding when producing output .
Multi-language support and correct encoding handling is usually a non-issue when building a Python application .
For example , non-ASCII input to , and output from , a Pylons web application Just Works ™ .
Regular Expressions
For a language that borrows so heavily from Perl , the regular expression support in Ruby is pretty disappointing .
Regular expressions might not seem like a very important part of a language , but it ’s an interesting litmus test because Python , Perl , and JavaScript all support essentially the same regular expression syntax .
Ruby ’s regular expressions , however , were so broken that I switched to Ruby 1.9 to finish porting PottyMouth .
Ruby ’s Regexp : : MULTILINE flag does n’t behave the way multiline does in other languages .
In other languages , the multiline flag is off by default , and when enabled , it considers .
to include newlines and ^ and $ to match right after , and right before , every newline :
In Perl :
if ( " foonbarnbaz " =~ / ^bar / m ) { print " yesn " ; } else { print " non " ; } yes if ( " foonbarnbaz " =~ / ^bar/ ) { print " yesn " ; } else { print " non " ; } no
In Python :
>>> import re #
This matches >>> re.search ( ' ^baz ' , " foonbarnbaz " , re .
MULTILINE ) < _sre.SRE_Match object at 0xb7c4bf38 > #
This does not match >>> re.search ( ' ^baz ' , " foonbarnbaz " )
However , in Ruby , the Regexp : : MULTILINE flag appears to only affect the interpretation of . , not ^ and $ , making it more like Python ’s re.DOTALL or Perl ’s /s switch .
in Ruby :
irb ( main ) : 001:0 > /^baz/.match ( " foonbarnbaz " ) => #< MatchData:0xb7cd42b0 > irb( main ) :002:0 > /^baz/m.match ( " foonbarnbaz " ) => #< MatchData:0xb7cdb740 > irb( main ) :003:0 > Regexp.new ( ' ^baz ' ) . match ( " foonbarnbaz " ) => #< MatchData:0xb7cc7df8 > irb( main ) :004:0 > Regexp.new ( ' ^baz ' , Regexp :: MULTILINE ) .match ( " foonbarnbaz " ) => #< MatchData:0xb7cb59dc >
There is no documentation whatsoever of the actual semantics of Regexp : : MULTILINE , so it ’s not clear whether this is an accident , a bug , or an intentional departure from the standard .
Either way , it makes the language more difficult to learn and less predictable to use .
There ’s also no documentation whatsoever of the actual semantics of Regexp : : EXTENDED .
The eregex.rb file in the Ruby source just adds support for & and | logical operators , and the only documentation is the message “ This is just a proof of concept toy . ”
As best I can tell , regular expressions in Ruby always behave like extended regular expressions , supporting ? , + , | and N , regardless of whether you use the extended flag or not .
What does the extended flag actually do ?
I do n’t know .
Ruby ’s Regular expressions also match only ASCII and a small set of encodings , including UTF - 8 and the Japanese encodings EUC and SJIS .
Want to write a regular expression that matches UTF - 16 , Latin - 1 , or raw Unicode ?
You ’ll have to use the third - party Oniguruma package or a different programming language .
You ca n’t use pure Ruby .
Lastly , positive and negative look - behind are n’t supported in Ruby 1.8 .
I only noticed this because the code I was porting used negative look - behind expressions .
Ruby 1.9 adds look - behind .
The options for Ruby 1.8 users are to install 1.9 or the third - party Oniguruma package , which also supports many more encodings ( but still not raw Unicode ) .
Both Python and Perl support positive and negative look - behind and Unicode regular expressions natively .
In general , it ’s a bad sign when a third - party reimplements a large chunk of functionality in an existing piece of software .
It means that the existing functionality was just plain not good enough .
And , for open source projects , it means that the existing project was unable , or unwilling , to solve the problem , or let others contribute patches to solve the problem , within the project .
The fact that this happened for both Ruby ’s encoding and regular expression support is disturbing .
Documentation
The Standard Library Documentation for Ruby is woefully incomplete .
For example :
There is no documentation whatsoever for : the digest library , which contains the SHA1 and MD5 check - sum tools .
These tools are critical for generating secure cookies and storing user passwords securely .
Without documentation , you have to go read the Ruby source code to know that your application is secure .
Racc , a LALR ( 1 ) parser generator for Ruby
The documentation for gdbm only includes a list of constants it defines .
No methods , descriptions , or anything else .
The documentation for the syslog module is useless .
It lists one method , close .
A useful syslog library would have to have at least open and write functionality .
.
A useful library would have to have at least and functionality .
The link to the tcltklib module documentation returns an error page .
The Profiler documentation is extremely limited .
It looks like it would be possible to use the profiler , but there ’s no information about how it works , which is critical when you are profiling an application .
As noted above , the regular expression documentation does n’t cover MULTILINE or EXTENDED .
In general , the majority of modules listed have no description page .
None of the pages specifically state which version of Ruby they were written for .
Ruby ’s development and documentation writing appear to be two disconnected endeavors , and the documentation is acknowledged to be incomplete .
In fact , there is no single rally point for Ruby material .
A visit to the the official Ruby documentation page lists a variety of documentation , tutorials , examples , etc. spread across many different websites with varying levels of completeness and relevancy to the current version of Ruby .
There is no single tutorial or language overview which is complete for the current version of Ruby 1.8.x ( over four years old ) .
This does n’t inspire confidence .
Are there any libraries that are n’t listed at all ?
And how many of the existing libraries have documentation that is incomplete , out - of - date , or incorrect ?
By contrast , Python ’s standard library documentation is complete , versioned and dated .
Migration to Ruby 1.9/2.0
It ’s not clear what ’s happening with regard to Ruby 1.9 and / or 2.0 .
Ruby 1.9 has been under development since ( at least ) 2006 .
( It may have been under development longer than that ; the lack of any official documentation about it makes it hard to know for sure .
This podcast claims it ’s been around longer than Perl 6 , which would make Ruby 2.0 almost as old as Ruby itself . )
An experimental / development version , 1.9.0 , was released in December 2007 .
I tested against the version of Ruby 1.9 in Ubuntu 7.10 : 1.9.0+20070830-2ubuntu1 .
Quite a few things that are allegedly new in Ruby 1.9 actually exist in Ruby 1.8 , and it ’s not clear whether they ’ve been back - ported or whether their behavior has only subtly changed .
For example return value unpacking , % string formatting , and newlines inside the ternary operator are supposedly new in 1.9 , but work exactly the same in 1.8 .
Other things that are supposed to be introduced in Ruby 1.9 , like multiple splats , do n’t ( yet ) work at all in 1.9 .
Other improvements in Ruby 1.9 include literal hash syntax , block - local variables , and , as already noted , better encoding and regular expression support .
Some documents indicate that Ruby 2.0 is going to be different in ways that will break existing Ruby 1.x programs severely .
They also contain disturbing statements like this one about the new garbage collector : “ It will be ( mostly ) thread safe . ”
Being ( mostly ) thread safe is like being mostly pregnant .
You either are , or you are n’t .
There are two explanations for this lack of clear plan for Ruby 2.0 .
Either Ruby 2.0 is so far off that no such document would be useful yet , or nobody in the Ruby community has thought about these issues yet .
Both of these would be bad signs .
Either way , it ’s a total mystery how difficult it will be to move to Ruby 2.0 , or when that move might have to happen .
Python , on the other hand , has been in the 2.x series for a long time .
Planning for Python 2.0 began while Python 1.5 was the current version .
In September 2000 , as Python 1.6 was released , there was a complete outline available of what to expect from Python 2.0 .
Python 2.0 was released in October , 2000 .
Programs written eight years ago for Python 2.0 will still run , unmodified under Python 2.5 .
Many Python 1.x programs will also run under 2.5 .
Python 2.6 and Python 3.0 are slated for release this summer .
The Python 3.0 process has been going on for about a year .
There is a clear outline of exactly what ’s changing between 2 and 3 , and guidelines for how to write Python code that will run equally well under 2.6 and 3.0 .
The Python developers are also providing a conversion program that will automatically translate between 2.6 and 3.0 code , and warn programmers about code it was not able to translate .
Python proves that a programming language can evolve safely , easily , and largely free of hassles .
Future versions should not be a potential wild - card ( or worse , a complete clusterfuck , as with PHP ) .
For a piece of software that ’s going to be the core of your business for as long as you are in business — hopefully many , many years — why choose anything other than a language with a migration process like Python’s ?
Performance
It ’s difficult to precisely evaluate the difference in execution time between different languages .
However , The Computer Language Benchmark Game gives a pretty strong indication that Ruby is slow .
On its tests , Python is 3 × - 4 × as fast as Ruby .
Ruby is slower than TCL , a language that is twenty years old .
Ruby is about the same speed as JavaScript ( in Mozilla ’s SpiderMonkey interpreter ) .
The only thing slower than Ruby is Prolog .
The notorious Rails is a Ghetto article outlines performance problems in Ruby and Rails that , disturbingly , went unaddressed for long periods of time .
In the worst one , the author reported serious performance issues to the Rails community , which largely ignored the problem or denied its existence .
Meanwhile , the problem had been identified and patched by someone else , but the Ruby core developers ignored the patch for a year .
In another incident in the same article , the original Rails author admits that the original Rails code required about four hundred restarts a day , or six to seven restarts per thread per day .
Four hundred restarts a day means four - hundred chances for a database transaction to fail , four hundred chances for a verification email to be sent by the system without the corresponding data being stored in the database , four hundred chances for the user ’s browser to not receive all the data it needs to correctly render a page or display data .
Even for a project for which performance is not the primary concern , these trends should be cause for concern .
Serious performance issues mean buying more RAM , and upgrading servers sooner .
Scoping
Ruby ’s scoping rules are complex :
Files , modules , classes , defs and blocks create new scopes .
Local variables have no sigil and begin with a lowercase letter .
They are available only in the scope they are defined in .
“ Constants ” have no sigil and begin with an uppercase letter .
They are available in the scope they are defined in and in all enclosed scopes .
“ Constants ” are not constant ; they can be reassigned whenever you like , just like everything else .
Globals begin with the $ sigil and are global .
Instance attributes begin with the @ sigil and are , by default , protected , or available only inside the class .
Instance attributes can be made available outside the class with attr_accessor or attr_reader .
Class attributes begin with the @@ sigil and are available only inside the class .
Unlike instance attributes , class attributes cannot be accessed outside the class with attr_accessor or friends .
Methods are , by default , public .
Methods can be made private or protected with the private or protected keywords .
protected does n’t mean what you think it means .
Both private and protected methods are available within the class and within all containing subclasses .
The terminology used to refer to non-constant “ constants ” is extremely unfortunate .
Why is n’t the full range of public / protected / private scopes available to attributes as well as methods ?
Why is a totally different convention used to scope attributes ?
Why ca n’t class attributes be accessed outside the class like instance attributes ?
What is the point of the subtle , weird difference between protected and private ?
What problem does it solve ?
Why do n’t protected and private work the way they do in Java and PHP ?
Clear , consistent , simple scoping makes it easy to keep track of what variables are available where .
Complex scoping rules mean there ’s more to remember , there are more mistakes to make and more ways to get confused .
Mistakes and confusion cause bugs .
Python uses just a naming convention to convey whether a variable should be thought of as private or protected .
Both Python and Ruby can be monkeypatched to modify private and protected attributes or methods , so it ’s best to think of private and protected as purely advisory in either language .
Experienced Pythonistas learn that someobj .
__private__ is a red flag ; the fact that you must always monkeypatch to do this in Ruby might provide an additional disincentive to doing it , but it also makes it easier to do it on accident .
One nice thing about Ruby ’s scoping
There ’s one place where Ruby ’s scope behavior is better than Python’s .
Default argument values in function definitions are ( re ) evaluated each time a method is called in Ruby .
In Python , default argument values get evaluated in the containing scope when the function is defined .
This can get you into trouble in Python , if a default value is a mutable type .
If you ’re modifying the value , it ’ll persist across subsequent calls to foo :
def foo ( arg= [ ] ) :
In Python , you end up having to do this :
def foo( arg=None ) : if foo is None : foo= [ ] # some code
This is definitely less clear than in Ruby , where you can simply say what you mean :
def foo ( arg= [ ] ) # some code end
There ’s more than one way to do it
We can thank Larry Wall and Perl for There ’s more than one way to do it .
TMTOWTDI is bad , because to really know a language , you must know each of several ways to do similar , but different things , and each synonym .
If there is only one way to do it , you only have to remember that one way , instead of many .
Programmers spend more time reading code than writing it , and often , they ’re reading other people ’s code , so they ca n’t get away with remembering only their favorite way to do it .
The more you have to remember , the more likely you are to forget , make a mistake , or have to stop to check the documentation .
Mistakes breed bugs , and checking the documentation takes time .
While not nearly as bad as Perl on this front , Ruby commits some serious TMTOWTDI .
String conversion
Some Ruby objects have an extra stringification method , . to_str , as well as the standard .to_s .
. to_s is an explicit cast , used whenever you need a string representation of an object .
. to_str is an implicit cast , which gets called when you are using a string - like object in a context that requires a string .
( This illustrates a philosophical difference between Python on the one hand and Ruby and Perl on the other ; Python never does context - sensitive implicit conversion . )
The naming of these methods is atrocious — they are radically semantically different , yet the name of one is an abbreviation of the name of another .
What happens if you write code that critically relies on this distinction , go work in another language for six months , and then get called in to fix a critical production bug in that code ?
Would you remember which is which , and what the difference was , exactly ?
I would n’t .
And the presence of both has confused people other than me .
. to_str should be named something like . stringcontext .
What is the use case for to_s ‘s concatenation of arrays and hashes ?
It just runs keys , values , and items together in a string , making it impossible to tell whether it was a number , a string , a hash or an array that you just stringified :
irb ( main ) :001:0 > h = { 1= > 2} => { 1= > 2} irb( main ) : 002:0 > a = [ 1,2 ] => [ 1 , 2 ] irb( main ) : 003:0 > h.to_s => " 12 " irb( main ) : 004:0 > a.to_s => " 12 " irb( main ) : 005:0 > a.to_s == h.to_s => true
When is this useful ?
It ’s not human - readable , and it ’s not computer - readable .
It ’s just mangled garbage .
It ’s even worse when you call to_s on more complex data structures :
irb ( main ) : 001:0 > c = [ 1 , : two , {: foo= > [ ' bar ' , ' baz ' ] , : key= >' val'} , [ 7,8 ] , 9 ] => [ 1 , : two , { : key = > " val " , : foo= > [ " bar " , " baz " ] } , [ 7 , 8 ] , 9 ] irb( main ) : 002:0 > c.to_s => " 1twokeyvalfoobarbaz789 "
As a side note , Python has two stringification methods as well , str ( ) and repr ( ) . str( ) provides a string representation , and repr ( ) provides a string that can be eval ( ) - ed or pasted into a Python interpreter .
Ruby appears to have no equivalent of repr ( ) , aside from p , which leads to the next topic … .
What is the difference between print , p , and puts ?
This is n’t documented .
p is a sort of poor - man ’s repr ( ) , printing each argument in a form that could be pasted into Ruby source code on a separate line .
Strangely , there ’s no way to capture the output of p and store that string for later .
print prints each of its arguments without any space between them .
puts prints each of its arguments , or each item in each collection argument , on a separate line .
Why does Ruby need all three ?
Are you going to be able to remember which one behaves each way , and use the right one at the right time ?
Not only does Python get away with one , but the behavior of print in Python is exactly what I ’ve wanted out of print , or printf , in every programming languge I ’ve ever used — print the str ( ) - ification of every argument , separated by spaces , with a newline at the end .
If you want all the arguments concatenated , or on separate lines , you can join on empty string , or " n " .
If you do n’t want a trailing newline , use a trailing comma .
The behavior of puts is even weirder ; it seems to stop descending into collections at some point .
Note that the hash item is just stringified , but the items in the array inside the array are printed on separate lines :
irb ( main ) : 001:0 > c = [ 1 , : two , {: foo= > [ ' bar ' , ' baz ' ] , : key= >' val'} , [ 7,8 ] , 9 ] => [ 1 , : two , { : key = > " val " , : foo= > [ " bar " , " baz " ] } , [ 7 , 8 ] , 9 ] irb( main ) : 002:0 > puts c 1 two keyvalfoobarbaz 7 8 9 => nil
Ranges and slices
Ruby has two range operators , .. and ... .
Why ?
The only difference is that the shorter one , with two periods , returns a longer range , and the longer one returns a shorter range , not including the endpoint .
Can this possibly get any more confusing ?
The language should have one , not two .
It is not hard to add or subtract one when you want a range with , or without , its endpoints .
Python ’s range ( ) and xrange ( ) built - in , and its slice syntax , are less confusing , as they never include the endpoint .
They are also more powerful , because they allow a third “ step ” argument .
Want every other , or every third , element in a list , or a range that steps by 2 or 3 ?
Try l[ : : 2 ] or l[ : :3 ] , range ( start , stop , 2 ) or range ( start , stop , 3 ) .
Want the list in reverse ? [::- 1 ]
Want a range in reverse ?
range ( stop , start , - 1 ) .
Python ’s syntax is simpler , easier to remember , and more powerful to boot .
Ruby ’s range operators are also used to see if a value is in a particular range , like this :
irb ( main ) : 001:0 > ( 0..2**1000 ) === 2**999 => true
This has a disturbingly clever ring to it .
The range operator does n’t actually walk through every element in the 2**1000 element range and compare it to 2**999 — if it did , this code would n’t execute instantaneously .
It ’s doing something like this underneath : 2**999 >= 0 and 2**999 < 2**1000 .
The only reason to use a range operator like this , when it ’s about as much typing to just say what you mean directly , is when you have a range that you ’re passing around as a variable .
In Python , the corresponding idiom is 0 <= 2**999 < 2**1000 , but the ternary comparison syntax does n’t work in Ruby , so you have to write 0 <= 2*999 and 2*999 < 2**1000 in Ruby .
Python ’s xrange ( ) can also be passed around like a variable , but you test for membership with value in myrange instead of === .
Now imagine you ’re someone who has n’t seen Ruby before , or who has been working in some other language for months , who is now tasked with fixing a critical bug which relies on this strange , non-obvious idiom .
Are you going to know , or remember , that === combined with .. has special semantics ?
Compare that to how difficult of a time you will have understanding lower < value < upper , or value in myrange , in Python code .
Simplicity and straightforward syntax has a significant long - term benefit .
require and load
Ruby has two ways to handle code in other files require and load .
The difference is that require loads the code only once per application , and load loads it each time the interpreter sees load .
Yet again , there ’s more to remember to be fluent in Ruby .
This distinction is of dubious value ; if you have code that you want to run more than once , put it in a method and call the method .
Do n’t make the interpreter re-load , re-parse , and re-run the file .
And there ’s more .
The Ruby interpreter require s/ load s the file corresponding to the path specified by a string .
Unlike Python , Ruby has no concept of set of paths to search for modules by name , so you see recipes like this to establish a file ’s location and find modules installed on a system .
And because Ruby loads strings as paths instead of modules by name , you can trick the interpreter into accidentally requiring a file twice .
Oops !
Python provides __import__ if you need to reload a module , but by default , it only loads modules once per application .
And finally , since require and load just pull the contents of another file into your local namespace , there ’s no simple way to pull in just a single class or variable from a module .
And there ’s no way to ensure that classes in the file you ’re importing do n’t clobber classes in the file you ’re importing it into .
Want to attack lots of Ruby applications ?
Just write a helpful library with obfuscated code that overrides a common class , in something like HTTP or cookie authentication code , and adds a back door .
Raising exceptions , throwing symbols
Exception handling in Ruby is handled with raise / begin / rescue .
Python uses raise / try / except , and Java & JavaScript use throw / try / catch to perform essentially the same exception handling .
But Ruby also has throw / catch , which is unrelated to exception handling .
It is normally used as a way to achieve labeled break .
Now , labeled break is a feature that I ’d very much like to see in Python , but this feature in Ruby is essentially goto — and it ’s even more powerful than goto in C , since it is not confined to single functions .
Rather than debating the merits of goto , I ’ll just ask this : does Ruby have to use terms that are commonly associated with exception handling , for a feature that is totally unrelated to exception handling ?
do and then are extraneous
Ruby ’s while and if statements can optionally have do and then keywords following them :
while condition do # some code end if condition then # some code end
This is just one more extra variation that Ruby programmers have to remember to be able to read other people ’s code .
length and size , update and merge
What is the difference between the length and size methods on String , Array , and Hash ?
There is none .
Hashes have update and merge methods .
What ’s the difference ?
None .
These are particularly atrocious synonyms , because the English words they are based on are n’t synonymous .
What if you have a class representing a geometric object , and you want length and size to return different measurements ?
What if you have a class representing a wiki page or source code repository , and you want update and merge to perform radically different operations ?
When someone else is reading your code , and they ’ve been trained that these two methods are synonymous in Ruby , and they might forget that the methods are n’t synonymous in this particular code .
Object model
Ruby does n’t require self to be explicitly passed in to methods .
Python has explicit self , and for good reason .
Rather than using self to get at class and instance attributes , Ruby uses @ and @@ .
You can get at self , to pass it to a method in another object , by calling self .
And you can get at the superclass ’s method of the same name by calling super .
Arguably , if you need to get at a different method on the superclass , rather than that different method on self , then your object ’s inheritance is broken .
This is different from Python , but still fine .
You can delegate to another method on that class by simply calling that method .
And here ’s the problem with Ruby ’s object model : because you do n’t need to use @ to access methods , it ’s too easy to accidentally shadow a method with a local variable .
There ’s at least one case that requires self as an explicit reciever : when calling an attribute writer .
Otherwise you ’re just shadowing the attribute writer method locally .
It ’s not clear that there might not be other rare cases that require self as an explicit reciever too .
This seems dangerous ; in Python , self is always required .
In Ruby , you almost always do n’t need self , except in the rare case where you do .
This feels like an accident , or an overly clever solution .
Clever solutions make me suspicious , and inconsistency breeds bugs .
Simple solutions , like Python ’s strict reliance on explicit self , make me confident I ’m writing reliable code .
Faking keyword arguments
Ruby does n’t support keyword arguments .
The commmon idiom to “ fake ” keyword arguments lacks the expressiveness and versatility of Python .
In Python , you can have a function definition like this :
def HTMLTag ( tagname , parent =None , * children , ** attributes ) :
And you can call this function in many different ways :
HTMLTag ( " br " ) HTMLTag ( " div " , parent=bodytag ) HTMLTag ( " div " , bodytag , p1 , p2 , p3 , width = " 100 % " ) HTMLTag ( " a " , p1 , href = " http://google.com " , *[ " google " ] ) HTMLTag ( " a " , p1 , " google " , href = " http://google.com " , ) HTMLTag ( " hr " , width=77 , parent=div , height=4 , color= " #000 " ) HTMLTag ( " hr " , **{' parent ' : 1 , ' width ' : 77 , ' height ' : 4 , ' class ' : ' ruler '} )
Keyword arguments with default values may not seem like a very critical feature to be missing .
But it ’s one of the most powerful idioms in Python , because there are a lot of cases where arguments act like configuration , modifying a function ’s behavior .
If you can leave these modifiers off in the common case , code is faster to write and easier to read ; you do n’t have to remember the common modifier values ; and you ’re less likely to use the wrong modifier .
Ruby does support the * expansion and collection of Arrays , similar to Python .
And it does support default values for optional arguments :
def tallandskinny ( height=100 , width=1 ) print height , " tall " , width , " wide " end tallandskinny ( ) # prints " 100 tall 1 wide " tallandskinny ( 1 ) # prints " 1 tall 1 wide " tallandskinny ( 1 , 100 ) # prints " 1 tall 100 wide "
But the optional arguments ca n’t be passed in as key - words in a different order .
Ruby collects any key - value pairs in an argument list into a Hash , but that hash takes the place of a single argument position ; it has nothing to do with the parameter names in the method definition .
Here , the hash gets assigned to height and then stringified :
tallandskinny ( : width= >100 , : height = >1 ) # prints " width100height1 tall 1 wide "
To duplicate Python ’s keyword argument behavior , you have to write something significantly more complicated :
def tallandskinny ( kwargs={} ) defaults = { : width= > 1 , : height =>100} kwargs = defaults.update ( kwargs ) print kwargs [ : height ] , " tall " , kwargs [ : width ] , " wide " end
People on the #ruby - lang IRC channel were quick to point me to snippets of code like this and say “ Ruby can fake Python - style keyword arguments easily . ”
And they ’re right , you can fake it .
But users ( programmers , in this case ) should n’t have to resort to tricks to get a piece of software ( a programming language , in this case ) to work the way they want it to work .
If users are doing this , it means the software has failed to provide the features its users need .
It looks like keyword arguments are at least under consideration for a future version of Ruby .
Libraries
SAP support
SAP support is critical to the application that I ’ll be working on .
Ruby ’s SAP support is alpha , version 0.06 , and has n’t been updated in over a year .
Python ’s SAP support is 1.0 , and has been around for four years and there is documentation written by a SAP developer .
Ruby supports Date and DateTime objects natively , but there ’s no duration or timedelta support built - in .
There ’s only a third party Duration library written by the Rails people , no doubt to support the SQL duration type .
It ’s unacceptable that a duration / timedelta is n’t built in .
Why not ?
Because if it were built - in , subtracting two dates could return a timedelta , instead of a Rational , as it does in Ruby :
require ' date ' irb( main ) : 002:0 > puts Date.new ( 2008 , 03 , 29 ) - DateTime.new ( 2008 , 3 , 28 , 22 , 8 ) 7/90
It ’s not helpful to know that the time delta between 2008 - 3 - 28 22:08 and 2008 -3-29 is 7/90ths ( of a day ) .
What would be helpful is to know that it ’s 1:52:00 , like in Python :
>>> from datetime import datetime >>> dur = datetime ( 2008 , 3 , 29 ) - datetime ( 2008 , 3 , 28 , 22 , 8 ) >>> print dur , type ( dur ) 1:52:00 < type ' datetime.timedelta '>
Debugging
Ruby tracebacks do n’t print the line of code on which the error occurred .
Compare these two tracebacks , each in programs that divide by zero three function calls deep :
hack .rb:10 :in `/' : divided by 0 ( ZeroDivisionError ) from hack .rb:10 : in `baz ' from hack .rb: 6 : in `bar ' from hack .
rb:2: in `foo ' from hack .
rb:13
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " hack.py " , line 10 , in < module > foo(0 ) File " hack.py " , line 2 , in foo bar ( arg ) File " hack.py " , line 5 , in bar baz ( arg ) File " hack.py " , line 8 , in baz 8 / arg ZeroDivisionError : integer division or modulo by zero
Often you can see exactly what ’s going wrong just from a Python traceback , because you can see the line of code that was a problem .
Debugging Ruby is slower and more difficult because it does n’t provide this information .
By the way , Perl ’s even worse than Ruby at providing useful information when there ’s an error :
Illegal division by zero at hack .pl line 10 .
Rails & Pylons
The Ruby on Rails and Pylons web frameworks are more or less comparable .
A good chunk of Rails ’ core has been ported to the Python webhelpers package , which is used by Pylons ( and other Python web frameworks ) .
There does n’t seem to be any major features in one web framework and not the other .
Pylons has in - browser debugging ( off by default in production code ) and , since it relies on existing , and pluggable , templating , ORM , and other modules , may be slightly more mature and flexible .
Rails ’ DB migration is more mature than SQLAlchemy’s .
Cool things about Ruby
Ruby ’s block arguments have interesting potential , especially if you were writing a heavily thread - based or event - based application .
Of course , a traditional MVC web application does n’t really need threads or events ( unless you ’re writing a HTTP server too ) .
Most places where I ’ve used , or seen examples of , block arguments in Ruby are places where I would have used a list comprehension in Python .
In other words , block arguments are far more powerful than their common use case .
Metaprogramming with Ruby clearly takes less code than in Python .
I do n’t think there ’s anything that Ruby does that Python cannot , or vice versa , with regards to metaprogramming .
I ’ve needed real metaprogramming in Python extremely rarely , and I do n’t know if I ’d use the metaprogramming in Ruby any more frequently .
The examples of metaprogramming with Ruby that I ’ve seen ( The Poignant Guide ’s chapter , or the way ActiveRecord works ) would have been doable , in Python at least , by inheriting from a base class and using class attributes on the derived class as configuration variables .
So , whatever win that Ruby gets from easier metaprogramming is minor .
Conclusion
Ruby has standard libraries that are so poor the community has provided drop - in replacements .
The documentation about the current and future versions of the language is extremely lacking .
The core implementation of the language is not competitive with other interpreted languages .
And the language itself is full of idiosyncracies and inconsistencies that are neither useful nor lend themselves to cleaner , simpler code .
The language is not without promise or potential , but in its current state there is no reason to choose it over a mature , robust language like Python .

The devil China knows
NOT long after calling him a “ devil ” with a human face and the heart of a beast , Chinese officials are talking again to representatives of the Dalai Lama .
But in the Indian hill town of Dharamsala , the seat of Tibet 's government - in - exile , few believe China 's own heart has changed .
“ The basis of their attitude towards Tibet is ... distrust and fear , ” the Dalai Lama told The Economist a day after a meeting on May 4th in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen between two of his envoys and two senior Communist Party officials .
It was the first contact between the two sides since unrest broke out in Tibet and other ethnic Tibetan regions of China in March .
Both sides are anxious not to appear to be closing the door .
Lodi Gyari , one of the Dalai Lama 's representatives at the talks , described them as a “ step in the right direction ” and said more would be held , though no date has been announced .
China said there could be further contact as long as the Dalai Lama showed “ sincerity ” .
China 's surprising decision to offer renewed talks seemed aimed at deflecting foreign criticism of its handling of Tibet ahead of the Beijing Olympics in August .
But officials in Dharamsala are wary .
They deny the Shenzhen meeting was a continuation of six rounds of confidence - building discussions held between 2002 and July 2007 .
Rather , it was an “ emergency conversation ” about the present crisis .
Mr Gyari said only the next round of talks would count as the resumption of a formal dialogue .
The Tibetans had several demands : an end to the clampdown in Tibet , including the withdrawal of security forces from monasteries ; no more “ patriotic education ” requiring monks to denounce the Dalai Lama ; an investigation by an international body into the causes of the unrest ; the release of political detainees ; and fair trials for those accused of rioting .
None of this will be heard sympathetically by China .
The state - controlled press is still vilifying the Dalai Lama and the authorities have maintained a tight grip on Tibetan regions .
Visits by foreign journalists remain largely banned and foreign tourists are barred .
Late last month , at secret trials in Lhasa , 30 people were sentenced to prison terms of between three years and life for their role in rioting in March .
Human Rights
Watch , a monitoring organisation in New York , said lawyers in Beijing who offered to represent them were warned by the Ministry of Justice that their licences might be revoked .
The Dalai Lama tries to sound conciliatory .
Tibetans , he says , should be proud that China is hosting the Olympics ( though , with a characteristic chuckle , he says he does not know whether they will be happy when the Olympic torch is paraded in Lhasa in June ) .
He says he fully supports a “ one - China policy ” , but that the future of Taiwan should be decided by its own people — which is anathema to China .
The Dalai Lama says he is not so concerned about redrawing Tibet 's political boundaries to include all ethnic Tibetan areas adjoining it ( an idea he once backed strongly , to China 's horror ) .
The priority , he says , is to protect the culture and environment of Tibetans .
But China will want a stronger retraction than this .
It believes the Dalai Lama is still intent on carving out a single Tibetan territory covering a quarter of China 's land area .
According to the Dalai Lama , Chinese officials accepted in 2006 during the fifth round of talks that he was sincere in his insistence that Tibet should be part of China .
But by the sixth round last year their attitude had hardened .
Some of the Dalai Lama 's officials say China took fright at signs of his continuing sway over Tibetans in China and his readiness to use it — for example , to persuade them to stop wearing the skins of endangered animals and worshipping Dorje Shugden , a cultic deity .
China 's crackdown on the recent unrest in Tibet may limit the Dalai Lama 's flexibility in dealing with China .
The streets of Dharamsala in the Himalayan foothills are full of Tibetan flags flown in sympathy with Tibetans in China .
Ubiquitous gruesome pictures show Tibetans shot by Chinese security forces .
The Dalai Lama says there has been “ a lot of criticism ” of his conciliatory negotiating stand with China .
He says he remains fully committed to his approach in spite of recent events .
So too , however , does China .
WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - Road workers in a small New Zealand town got their wish granted when a woman stripped saying she was fed up with their wolf - whistles .
The Israeli tourist was about to use an ATM in the main street of Kerikeri , in the far north of the country , when the men whistled , the New Zealand Press Association reported .
She calmly stripped off , used the cash machine , before getting dressed and walking away .
The woman told police she did n’t take too kindly to the whistling from the men repairing the road .
“ She said she had thought ‘ bugger them , I ’ll show them what I ’ve got ’ , ” Police Sergeant Peter Masters told NZPA .
“ She gave the explanation that she had been ... pestered by New Zealand men .
She ’s not an unattractive looking lady , ” Masters said .
“ She was taken back to the police station and spoken to and told that was inappropriate in New Zealand . ”
Reuters photographer Howard Burditt , shown here in this undated file picture , has been detained for three days for allegedly using a satellite phone to transmit pictures .
REUTERS / Mike Hutchings
JOHANNESBURG ( Reuters ) - A Reuters photographer detained for three days in Zimbabwe for allegedly using a satellite phone to send pictures was released on bail on Thursday .
Howard Burditt , a Zimbabwean national who was covering the aftermath of the country ’s elections , had been held in jail since Monday .
David Schlesinger , Reuters Editor - in - Chief , said : “ I am extremely relieved that Howard has been released but disturbed that he should have been held in jail for so long on such a charge . ”
Reuters had earlier called for Burditt ’s immediate release .
“ As part of its pan -African news operations , Reuters has long had a legitimate and fully accredited bureau in Harare , and has always complied with Zimbabwean regulations with the aim of accurately reporting the news , ” a company statement said .
Zimbabwean authorities say it is illegal to use a satellite phone unless it has been registered .
Tension has risen in Zimbabwe since elections on March 29 , in which the ruling ZANU - PF party lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since independence in 1980 .
Official results released last week showed that opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai beat President Robert Mugabe in a parallel presidential vote , but not by the outright majority needed to avoid a run-off .
Tsvangirai says the outcome was rigged and has yet to say if he would contest a second round .
The date for this contest has not been announced .

The post Beautiful differentiation showed how easily and beautifully one can construct an infinite tower of derivative values in Haskell programs , while computing plain old values .
The trick ( from Jerzy Karczmarczuk ) was to overload numeric operators to operate on the following ( co ) recursive type :
data Dif b = D b ( Dif b )
This representation , however , works only when differentiating functions from a scalar ( one - dimensional ) domain , i.e. , functions of type a -> b for a scalar type a .
The reason for this limitation is that only in those cases can the type of derivative values be identified with the type of regular values .
Consider a function f :: ( R , R ) -> R , where R is , say , Double .
The value of f at a domain value ( x , y ) has type R , but the derivative of f consists of two partial derivatives .
Moreover , the second derivative consists of four partial second - order derivatives ( or three , depending how you count ) .
A function f :: ( R , R ) -> ( R , R , R ) also has two partial derivatives at each point ( x , y ) , each of which is a triple .
That pair of triples is commonly written as a two - by - three matrix .
Each of these situations has its own derivative shape and its own chain rule ( for the derivative of function compositions ) , using plain - old multiplication , scalar - times - vector , vector - dot - vector , matrix - times - vector , or matrix - times - matrix .
Second derivatives are more complex and varied .
How many forms of derivatives and chain rules are enough ?
Are we doomed to work with a plethora of increasingly complex types of derivatives , as well as the diverse chain rules needed to accommodate all compatible pairs of derivatives ?
Fortunately , not .
There is a single , simple , unifying generalization .
By reconsidering what we mean by a derivative value , we can see that these various forms are all representations of a single notion , and all the chain rules mean the same thing on the meanings of the representations .
This blog post is about that unifying view of derivatives .

What ’s a derivative ?
To get an intuitive sense of what ’s going on with derivatives in general , let ’s look at some examples .
If you already know about calculus on manifolds , you might want to skip ahead
One dimension
Start with a simple function on real numbers :
f1 :: R -> R f1 x = x ^2 + 3*x + 1
Writing the derivative of a function f as deriv f , let ’s now consider the question : what is deriv f1 ?
We might say that
deriv f1 x = 2*x+3
so e.g. , deriv f1 5 = 13 .
In other words , f1 is changing 13 times as fast as its argument , when its argument is passing 5 .
Rephrased yet again , if dx is a very tiny number , then f1 ( 5+dx ) - f1 5 is very nearly 13 * dx .
If f1 maps seconds to meters , then deriv f1 5 is 13 meters per second .
So already , we can see that the range of f ( meters ) and the range of deriv f ( meters / second ) disagree .
Two dimensions in and one dimension out
As a second example , consider a two - dimensional domain :
f2 :: ( R , R ) -> R f2 ( x , y ) = 2*x*y + 3*x + 5*y + 7
Again , let ’s consider some units , to get a guess of what kind of thing deriv f2 ( x , y ) really is .
Suppose that f2 measures altitude of terrain above a plane , as a function of the position in the plane .
( So f2 is a “ height field ” . )
You can guess that deriv f ( x , y ) is going to have something to do with how fast the altitude is changing , i.e. the slope , at ( x , y ) .
But there is n’t a single slope .
Instead , there ’s a slope for every possible compass direction ( a hiker ’s degrees of freedom ) .
Now consider the conventional math answer to what is deriv f2 ( x , y ) .
Since f2 has a two - dimensional domain , it has two partial derivatives , and its derivative is commonly written as a pair of the two partials :
deriv f2 ( x , y ) = ( 2* y+3 , 2*x+5 )
In our example , these two pieces of information correspond to two of the possible slopes .
The first is the slope if heading directly east , and the second if directly north ( increasing x and increasing y , respectively ) .
What good does it do our hiker to be told just two of the infinitude of possible slopes at a point ?
The answer is perhaps magical : for well - behaved terrains , these two pieces of information are enough to calculate all ( infinitely many ) slopes , with just a bit of math .
Every direction can be described as partly east and partly north ( perhaps negatively for westish and southish directions ) .
Given a direction angle ang ( where east is zero and north is 90 degrees ) , the east and north components are cos ang and sin ang , respectively .
When heading in the direction ang , the slope will be a weighted sum of the north - going slope and the east - going slope , where the weights are the north and south components ( cos ang and sin ang ) .
Instead of angles , our hiker may prefer thinking directly about the north and east components of a tiny step from the position ( x , y ) .
If the step is small enough and lands dx feet to the east and dy feet to the north , then the change in altitude , f2 ( x+dx , y+dy ) - f2 ( x , y ) is very nearly equal to ( 2*y+3 ) * dx + ( 2*x+5 ) * dy .
If we use ( <.> ) to mean dot ( inner ) product , then this change in altitude is deriv f2 ( x , y ) <.> ( dx , dy ) .
From this second example , we can see that the derivative value is not a range value , but also not a rate - of - change of range values .
It ’s a pair of such rates with the know - how to use those rates to determine output changes .
Two dimensions in and three dimensions out
Next , imagine moving around on a surface in space , say a torus , and suppose that the surface has grid marks to define a two - dimensional parameter space .
As our hiker travels around in the 2D parameter space , his position in 3D space changes accordingly , more flexibly than just an altitude .
This situation corresponds to a function from 2D to 3D :
f3 :: ( R , R ) -> ( R, R , R )
At any position ( s ,t ) in the parameter space , and for every choice of direction through parameter space , each of the the coordinates of the position in 3D space has a rate of change .
Again , if the function is mathematically well - behaved ( differentiable ) , then all of these rates of change can be summarized in two partial derivatives .
This time , however , each partial derivative has components in X , Y , and Z , so it takes six numbers to describe the 3D velocities for all possible directions in parameter space .
These numbers are usually written as a 3 - by - 2 matrix m ( the Jacobian of f3 ) .
Given a small parameter step ( dx , dy ) , the resulting change in 3D position is equal to the product of the derivative matrix and the difference vector , i.e. , m `timesVec` ( dx , dy ) .
A common perspective
The examples above use different representations for derivatives : scalar numbers , a vector ( pair of numbers ) , and a matrix .
Common to all of these representations is the ability to turn a small step in the function ’s domain into a resulting step in the range .
In f1 , the ( scalar ) derivative c really means ( c *) , meaning multiply by c .
, the ( scalar ) derivative really means , meaning multiply by .
In f2 , the ( vector ) derivative v means ( v <. > ) .
, the ( vector ) derivative means .
In f3 , the ( matrix ) derivative m means ( m `timesVec` ) .
So , the common meaning of these derivative representations is a function , and not just any function , but a linear function –often called a “ linear map ” or “ linear transformation ” .
For a function lf to be linear in this context means that
lf ( u+v ) == lf u + lf v , and
, and lf ( c*v ) == c * lf v , for scalar values c .
Now what about the different chain rules , saying to combine derivative values via various kinds of products ( scalar / scalar , scalar / vector , vector / vector dot , matrix / vector ) ?
Each of these products implements the same abstract notion , which is composition of linear maps .
What about Dif ?
Now let ’s return to the derivative towers we used before :
data Dif b = D b ( Dif b )
As I mentioned above , this representation only works when derivative values can be represented just like range values .
That punning of derivative values with range values works when the domain type is one dimensional .
For functions over higher - dimensional domains , we ’ll have to use a different representation .
Assume a type of linear functions from a to b :
type a :-* b = . . .
( In Haskell , type constructors beginning with a colon are used infix . )
Since the derivative type depends on domain as well as range , our derivative tower will have two type parameters instead of one .
To make definitions prettier , I ’ll change derivative towers to an infix operator as well .
data a :> b = D b ( a :> ( a :-* b ) )
An infinitely differentiable function is then one that produces a derivative tower :
type a :~> b = a -> ( a:>b)
What ’s next ?
Perhaps now you ’re wondering :
Are these lovely ideas workable in practice ?
What happens to the code from Beautiful differentiation ?
What use are derivatives , anyway ?
These questions and more will be answered in upcoming installments .
The post Beautiful differentiation showed how easily and beautifully one can construct an infinite tower of derivative values in Haskell programs , while computing plain old values .

John McCain today finally denounced and rejected the endorsement of fundamentalist Pastor John Hagee .
It was n’t Hagee ’s comments on the Catholic Church “ the great whore ” ) or gays ( God sent Hurricane Katrina to New Orleans as punishment for a gay pride parade ) that went too far for McCain .
It was Hagee ’s claim on a 1990s television show that Hitler was doing “ God ’s work ” during the Holocaust by setting in motion events that forced Jews to return to Israel .
Now what about Rod Parsley ?
This political ally of McCain has decried Islam as a “ false religion ” and says it ’s the historic mission of the United States to eradicate Islam .
McCain has yet to reject the endorsement from Parsley , with whom he campaigned in February .
It ’s tough to figure out McCain ’s moral universe .
Attributing Hitler ’s mass - murder of Jews to God–that ’s a no - no .
Calling for the destruction of an entire religion ?
So far , that ’s no reason for McCain to reject an endorsement .
UPDATE : After McCain rejected Hagee ’s endorsement , Hagee withdrew his endorsement of McCain .
In other words , you ca n’t fire me , I quit .
BTW , McCain is also finally releasing his medical records–after postponing doing so for a year .
But he ’s making these records available for only three hours on a Friday before a holiday weekend –to guarantee less media coverage–and his campaign has sort of banned New York Times reporter Lawrence Altman , one of the leading medical reporters in journalism , from reviewing the records .
Only a handful of media outfits selected by the campaign will be permitted to send reporters to a conference room in Phoenix to examine the records .
And the Times was not chosen .
None of the reporters will be allowed to make any copies of the records .
Glickman stressed that such legislation would severely harm anti-piracy efforts , a matter of concern to everyone in the film industry .
MPAA chief :
Net neutrality just a ' clever name '
Marking the trade group ’s strongest stance ever on the subject , Motion Picture Association of America chief Dan Glickman blasted potential government interference with the Internet , referring to Net neutrality as “ a clever name ” but also a practice that would interfere with broadband providers ’ efforts to curb movie piracy .
Speaking at a convention of movie theater owners in Las Vegas on Tuesday , Glickman came out strongly against federal Internet regulations that he sees harming his association ’s membership .

Studios are concerned that so - called net neutrality laws might someday interfere with using the web as a major distribution channel .
“ This is a high - stakes debate , ” Glickman said .
“ Do we take a stand for intellectual property rights or cast them aside in the digital environment ?
Are we permitted to respond to consumers , innovate on their behalf and compete with the world , or are we told by our government to stand down ?
Today , the MPAA and all of our studios are standing up in opposition to broad - based government regulation of the Internet . ”
During his speech , Glickman stressed that such legislation would severely harm anti-piracy efforts , a matter of concern to everyone in the film industry .
“ No one here needs a lecture on what happens when one illegal copy makes its way to the Internet — God forbid on opening weekend — and is instantly available , ” Glickman told the movie theater owners , studio execs and others .
“ Today , new tools are emerging that allow us to work with Internet service providers to prevent illegal activity .
[ But ] new efforts are emerging in Washington to stop this essential progress .
This effort is being called by its proponents ‘ Net neutrality . ’
It ’s a clever name , ” Glickman continued , “ but there ’s nothing neutral about this for our customers or for our ability to make great movies in the future . ”
Glickman went on to say explain how such regs would “ impede our ability to respond to consumers in innovative ways , and impair the ability of broadband providers to address the serious , rampant piracy problems occurring over their networks today . “
He also touted the health of the overall film business , urging exhibitors to keep up with new technologies as more moviegoers “ pimp their living room ” to provide a theater - like experience .
Glickman said the industry was experiencing something of an economic boomlet , with about “ 5 percent growth in the domestic and worldwide box office — all - time highs for both … ”
Though international distribution accounts for twice the returns of the U.S. box office , Glickman noted that approximately 1.4 billion movie tickets were sold in the U.S. last year .
If an MPAA survey is any indication , most moviegoers do n’t mind what they pay for the entertainment , Glickman said .
More than three - quarters of the survey respondents said that going to movies was “ time and money well spent . ”
The growth of independent films may also have fueled the industry ’s boomlet .
In 2002 , about 450 films were released , while last year saw 600 hit theaters .
Six years ago , the big MPAA - member studios accounted for half of all movies distributed , but last year the figure was down to around 30 percent , meaning indie operators were on the rise .
Contrary to conventional wisdom , however , Glickman said that while consumers are tricking out their dens and living rooms with massive flat screens and surround sound systems , it ’s those same high - tech devotees who head to the multiplex most often .
“ High - tech consumers go to the movies 50 percent more often than their lower - tech counterparts — an extra four trips each year , ” he reported .
“ And , overwhelmingly , consumers say the ultimate movie experience is going to the movies . ”
Still , he warned theater owners to keep abreast of technological change , perhaps by selling DVDs at the box office or pre-selling digital downloads when films are still fresh and timely .
“ We can deliver on new consumer choices , figure out how to make them work and enhance the value chain , ” he offered , “ or we continue to lose customers , as too often we already do , to lawlessness . ”
Referring to several movies during his speech , Glickman praised “ Charlie Wilson ’s War ” for personal reasons , since he and the former Texas congressman served together in the House .
“ As you saw in the film , he was an unrepentant ladies ’ man .
I hoped to have him join us for our screening in Washington , but Charlie was recovering from a heart transplant , ” Glickman said .
“ On his behalf , I made a point of sharing with our guests that all of Charlie ’s organs are now in full working condition . ”
Baghdad rocked as McCain , Cheney visit Associated Press
Published : Monday March 17 , 2008

Print This Email This Sen. John McCain stressed the importance of a U.S. commitment to Iraq during talks with Iraq 's prime minister Monday , and explosions struck Baghdad during twin visits by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Helicopter gunships circled over central Baghdad and the heavily fortified Green Zone , but no details were immediately available on the cause of the explosions .
McCain , who has linked his political future to U.S. military success in Iraq , met Monday with Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki shortly before the Iraqi leader began separate talks with Cheney .
Al - Maliki said he and the vice president discussed ongoing negotiations over a long - term security agreement between the two countries that would replace the U.N. mandate for foreign troops set to expire at the end of the year .
" This visit is very important .
It is about the nature of the relations between the two countries , the future of those relations and the agreement in this respect , " the prime minister told reporters .
" We also discussed the security in Iraq , the development of the economy and reconstruction and terrorism . "
McCain also said it was important to maintain the U.S. commitment in Iraq and warned that a U.S. - Iraqi military operation to clear al - Qaida from its last urban stronghold of Mosul , 225 miles northwest of Baghdad , will be " very difficult and very important . "
McCain , who arrived in Iraq on Sunday , told reporters that he also discussed with the Shiite leader the need for progress on political reforms , including laws on holding provincial elections and the equitable distribution of Iraq 's oil riches .
The Arizona senator said he had reviewed the security situation in Baghdad with Iraqi officials .
He also visited the Anbar province city of Haditha on Sunday , drinking soft drinks from street vendors and answering questions about the U.S. presidential campaign to tout recent security gains ahead of the fifth anniversary of the U.S. - led invasion .
Asked by one of the vendors if he would return to Iraq , McCain responded , " We 'll come back if I win . "
Footage of the visit was distributed on a military Web site .
Cheney landed at Baghdad International Airport , then flew by helicopter for talks with U.S. and Iraqi officials .
It is Cheney 's third vice presidential trip to Iraq where 160,000 American troops are deployed and the U.S. death toll is nearing 4,000 .
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said it could not confirm reports of a rocket attack on the Green Zone after Cheney 's arrival .
" I 'm not aware of any , " embassy spokeswoman Mirembe Nantongo said .
Violence has dropped throughout the capital with an influx of some 30,000 additional U.S. soldiers as well as a Sunni revolt against al - Qaida and a cease - fire by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army militia .
The U.S. military has said attacks have fallen by about 60 percent since last February .
McCain met with Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh on Sunday and planned to meet with Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , the U.S. Embassy said .
Further details of the visit were not released for security reasons , the embassy said .
Before leaving the United States , McCain , who was making his eighth trip to Iraq , said the tour to the Middle East and Europe was for fact - finding purposes , not a campaign photo opportunity .
McCain , the senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , was accompanied by Sens. Joe Lieberman , an independent , and Republican Lindsey Graham , two top supporters of his presidential ambitions .
The weeklong trip will take McCain to Israel , Britain and France .
In other violence Monday , police said they found the bodies of three members of a U.S. - allied group fighting al - Qaida in Udaim , 70 miles north of Baghdad .
Members of the mostly Sunni groups have been increasingly targeted by suspected al - Qaida members seeking to derail the recent security gains .
A roadside bomb targeting a U.S. convoy injured four civilians in Baghdad , while a separate bombing in the capital 's Mansour neighborhood injured a policeman .
Both were reported by police officials on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush on Monday urged lawmakers to quickly approve the Colombia free trade agreement he was sending to the U.S. Congress , but Democratic critics said the pact was not ready for a vote and would fail .
“ This agreement will advance America ’s national security interests in a critical region , ” Bush said .
“ It will strengthen a courageous ally in our hemisphere , it will help America ’s economy and America ’s workers at a vital time , it deserves bipartisan support from the United States Congress . ”
Some in the Democratic - led Congress have objected to ratifying the agreement over concerns about violence against trade unionists in Colombia and about potential U.S. job losses .
The agreement would cut tariffs on imported goods from both countries , although many Colombian goods already enjoy duty - free entry to the United States .
Proponents argue a failure to pass it would mainly hurt U.S. farmers and workers .
“ While we will continue to work closely with Congress , the need for this agreement is too urgent , the stakes for our national security are too high , to allow this year to end without a vote , ” Bush said before signing a letter to transmit the agreement to Congress on Tuesday .
Congress then has 90 legislative days to complete action .
“ Waiting any longer to send up the legislation would run the risk of Congress adjourning without the agreement ever getting voted on , ” Bush said .
Key Democrats criticized Bush for seeking a vote before what they considered sufficient consultation with Congress .
“ Under present circumstances , we cannot support the U.S. - Colombia Free Trade Agreement , ” said House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel in a joint statement .
The trade deal would expand markets for U.S. products at a time of economic slowdown , when “ we should be doing everything we can to open up new opportunities for growth , ” Bush said .
Passing the trade pact also would shore up U.S. credibility and undercut common leftist foes of Washington and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe in Latin America , Bush said .
“ By acting at this critical moment , we can show a watching world that America will honor its commitments , we can provide a powerful rebuke to dictators and demagogues in our backyard , we can expand U.S. exports and export - related jobs , ” he said .
Uribe , a supporter of free markets who has clashed recently with the left - wing leaders of Venezuela and Ecuador over charges they have backed Colombian rebels , has lobbied hard for the free trade deal to be passed swiftly .
“ The government of Colombia is confident that U.S. legislators from both parties will recognize the great importance that this agreement has , ” Uribe ’s government said in a statement released by the Colombian Embassy in Washington .

Colombia said it had reduced homicides , kidnappings and poverty in recent years .
“ This is the moment when we need our allies side by side to keep building a new Colombia , ” it said .
“ DEAD ON ARRIVAL ”
But Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Bush was sending the FTA to Congress prematurely because Colombia had not addressed concerns about violence against labor unionists he said was the worst in the world despite some Uribe reforms .
“ By sending up the Colombia FTA legislation under circumstances that maximize the chances it will fail , he will be adding one more mistake to his legacy and one more mess for the next President to clean up , ” the Nevada Democrat said .
Maine Democratic Rep. Mike Michaud , co-founder of the House of Representatives Trade Working Group , said Bush ’s effort to force a vote in the face of many Democrats ’ misgivings meant “ the Colombia FTA is dead on arrival . ”
The push for passage of the Colombian free trade deal will begin in earnest on Tuesday , when trade unionists from the South American country will talk to U.S. lawmakers , according to House Republican Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri .
He noted that a Peru trade deal passed the U.S. House of Representatives last year with about 90 percent of Republicans voting for the measure and nearly half of the Democrats joining in .
“ That ’s about what we would need again for this ( the Colombia trade deal ) to happen , ” Blunt said .
The Colombia trade deal roiled the race for the U.S. Democratic presidential nomination over the weekend , when a top campaign strategist to Sen .
Hillary Clinton resigned under fire for his meeting with a Colombian diplomat to discuss the pact .
Clinton said on Monday she would vote against the agreement and “ urge my Senate colleagues to do the same . ”

The small square at the left of each waveform vibrates at the instantaneous value of the voltage or current it represents .
The subscripts " o " and " rms " stand respectively for peak value and root - mean - square value .
The supply voltage ( A ) and the circuit current ( E ) will always have a phase difference φ .
The phase difference can be found by using the triangle ( H ) .
If the inductive reactance ( X L ) is greater than the capacitive reactance ( X C ) , the supply voltage will lead the current ; if the inductive reactance is smaller than the capacitive reactance , the supply voltage will lag behind the current .
) is greater than the capacitive reactance ( X ) , the supply voltage will lead the current ; if the inductive reactance is smaller than the capacitive reactance , the supply voltage will lag behind the current .
The p.d. across the resistor ( B ) oscillates inphase with the current ( E ) .
The p.d. across the capacitor ( C ) lags behind the current ( E ) by π/2 .
The p.d. across the inductor ( D ) leads the current ( E ) by π/2 .
In other words , ( C ) and ( D ) are always in antiphase .
The four RMS volatges are related by the triangle ( H ) .
The curve ( F ) shows the variation of the reciprocal of the impedance against frequency .
( G ) shows three rotating vectors ( phasors ) , their projections on the y - axis corresponds to the three instantaneous voltages .
Series resonance is achieved by adjusting f , L or C such that the purple dot is exactly at the highest point of the curve ( F ) .
At resonance , ( i ) phase diff = 0 and ( ii ) Z = R .
Therefore , ( A ) and ( B ) become exactly identical , ( A ) and ( E ) are inphase .
The circuit current ( E ) is the largest .
At resonance , the p.d. across the capacitor ( C ) and that across the inductor ( D ) may be large in magnitude but their sum is zero .
You might say it 's raining cats and dogs , but you do n't mean it literally .
But at times in many areas around the world that it has rained things stranger than felines and canines .
Weird rain is a bizarre and still largely unexplained phenomenon periodically reported from all corners of the globe .
There have been accounts of frog rain , fish rain , squid rain , worm rain , even alligator rain .
The logical explanation for the odd occurrences is that a tornado or strong whirlwind picked up the animals from a shallow body of water and carried them — sometimes for hundreds of miles — before dropping them on a bewildered populace .
This explanation has yet to be proven , and it can't quite account for all of the documented incidents , as you 'll see below .
Here are some of the most unusual cases .
They are a small sampling from among thousands of reports over the years that defy rational explanation .
In 1873 , Scientific American reported that Kansas City , Missouri was blanketed with frogs that dropped from the sky during a storm .
Minneapolis , Minnesota was pelted with frogs and toads in July 1901 .
A news item stated : " When the storm was at its highest ... there appeared as if descending directly from the sky a huge green mass .
Then followed a peculiar patter , unlike that of rain or hail .
When the storm abated the people found , three inches deep and covering an area of more than four blocks , a collection of a most striking variety of frogs ... so thick in some places [ that ] travel was impossible . "
The citizens of Naphlion , a city in southern Greece , were surprised one morning in May 1981 , when they awoke to find small green frogs falling from the sky .
Weighing just a few ounces each , the frogs landed in trees and plopped into the streets .
The Greek Meteorological Institute surmised they were picked up by a strong wind .
It must have been a very strong wind .
The species of frog was native to North Africa .
In 1995 , reports Fortean Times Online , Nellie Straw of Sheffield , England , was driving through Scotland on holiday with her family when they encountered a severe storm .
Along with the heavy rain , however , hundreds of frogs suddenly pelted her car .
A powerful whirlwind might explain a rain of small fish , but it cannot account for the ones that fell on a village in India .
As many as 10 people reported picking up fish that weighed as much as eight pounds that had come crashing down on them .
In February 1861 , folks in many areas of Singapore reported a rain of fish following an earthquake .
How could the two possibly correlate ?
Golfers dread gathering clouds and a rain that might ruin their game .
But imagine the consternation of several duffers in Bournemouth , England , in 1948 who received a shower of herring .
Priests often pray for blessings from above ... but fish ?
In 1966 , Father Leonard Bourne was dashing through a downpour across a courtyard in North Sydney , Australia , when a large fish fell from the sky and landed on his shoulder .
The priest nearly caught it as it slid down his chest , but it squirmed away , fell to the flooded ground and swam away .
These things do n't always happen in a heavy rain .
In 1989 , in Ipswich , Australia , Harold and Degen 's front lawn was covered with about 800 " sardines " that rained from above during a light shower .
This report is most unusual :
In an otherwise clear sky in Chilatchee , Alabama in 1956 , a woman and her husband watched as a small dark cloud formed in the sky .
When it was overhead , the cloud released its contents : rain , catfish , bass , and bream .
All of the fish were alive .
The dark cloud had turned to white , then dispersed .
Raining Flesh and Blood
In 1890 , Popular Science News reported that blood rained down on Messignadi , Calabria in Italy — bird 's blood .
It was speculated that the birds were somehow torn apart by violent winds , although there were no such winds at the time .
And no other parts of the bird came down , just blood .
J. Hudson 's farm in Los Nietos Township , California endured a rain of flesh and blood for three minutes in 1869 .
The grisly fall covered several acres .
The American Journal of Science confirmed a shower of blood , fat , and muscle tissue that fell on a tobacco farm near Lebanon , Tennessee in August 1841 .
Field workers , who actually experienced this weird shower , said they heard a rattling noise and saw " drops of blood , as they supposed ... fell from a red cloud which was flying over . "
Miscellaneous Weird Rain
In 1881 , a thunderstorm in Worcester , England , brought down tons of periwinkles and hermit crabs .
In November 1996 , a town in southern Tasmania was slimed .
Several residents woke up on a Sunday morning after a night of violent thunderstorms to find a strange , white - clear jelly - like substance on their property .
Apparently , it had rained either fish eggs or baby jellyfish .
A Korean fisherman , trolling off the coast of the Falkland Islands , was knocked unconscious by a single frozen squid that fell from the sky and konked him on the head .
In July 2001 , a red rain fell on Kerala , India .
At first , it was thought that a meteor was responsible for the strange - colored rain , but an analysis showed that the water was filled with fungal spores .
Still , where did all of those red spores come from to be rained down in such concentration ?
From about 1982 to 1986 , kernels of corn rained down on several houses in Evans , Colorado — tons of it , according to Gary Bryan , one of the residents .
Oddly , there were no cornfields in the area that might account for the phenomenon .
In August 2001 , the Wichita , Kansas area experienced an unexplained rain of corn husks .
The news report stated that " thousands of dried corn leaves fell over east Wichita — from about Central Avenue to 37th Street North , along Woodlawn Boulevard and on east — each about 20 to 30 inches long . "
In 1877 , several one - foot - long alligators fell on J. L. Smith 's farm in South Carolina .
They landed , unharmed , and started crawling around , reported The New York Times .
Raining Cows
Perhaps the most bizarre report is one that , unfortunately , cannot be confirmed .
It may be just the stuff of urban legend , but it 's so weird and so amusing that it had to be included .
You can decide whether or not it 's true .
Sometime around 1990 , a Japanese fishing boat was sunk in the Sea of Okhotsk off the eastern coast of Siberia by a falling cow .
When the crew members of the wrecked ship were fished from the water , they told authorities that they had seen several cows falling from the sky and that one of them crashed straight through the deck and hull .
At first , the story goes , the fishermen were arrested for trying to perpetrate an insurance fraud but were released when their story was verified .
It seems that a Russian transport plane carrying stolen cattle was flying overhead .
When the movement of the herd within the plane threw it off balance , the plane 's crew , to avoid crashing , opened the loading bay at the tail of the aircraft and drove them out to fall into the water below .
True story or hoax ?
One investigation traced the story back to a Russian television comedy series .
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in 2003
The Pentagon has announced charges against six Guantanamo Bay prisoners over their alleged involvement in the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US .
Prosecutors will seek the death penalty for the six , who include alleged plot mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
The charges , the first to allege the Guantanamo inmates ' direct involvement in 9/11 , are expected to be heard by a controversial military tribunal system .
About 3,000 people died in the hijacked plane attacks .
The Guantanamo Bay detention centre , in south - east Cuba , began to receive US military prisoners in January 2002 .
Hundreds have been released without charge but about 275 remain and the US hopes to try about 80 .
Tribunal process Brig Gen Thomas Hartmann , a legal adviser to the head of the Pentagon 's Office of Military Commissions , said the charges alleged a " long - term , highly sophisticated plan by al - Qaeda to attack the US " .
The accused will have his opportunity to have his day in court
Brig Gen Thomas Hartmann
He said there would be " no secret trials " and that they would be " as completely open as possible " .
" Relatively little amounts of evidence will be classified , " Gen Hartmann said .
The other five defendants are Ramzi Binalshibh , a Yemeni , Walid Bin Attash , also from Yemen , Ali Abd al - Aziz Ali , who was born in Balochistan , Pakistan , and raised in Kuwait , Mustafa Ahmad al - Hawsawi , a Saudi , and Mohammed al - Qahtani .
SUSPECTS CHARGED Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Walid Bin Attash ( above ) Ramzi Binalshibh Ali Abd al - Aziz Ali Mustafa Ahmad al - Hawsawi Mohammed al - Qahtani
Profiles :
The six suspects Gen Hartmann said the charges included conspiracy , murder in violation of the laws of war , attacking civilians , destruction of property and terrorism .
All but Mr Qahtani and Mr Hawsawi are also charged with hijacking or hazarding an aircraft .
The charges listed " 169 overt acts allegedly committed by the defendants in furtherance of the September 11 events " .
Gen Hartmann said : " The accused will have his opportunity to have his day in court .
" It 's our obligation to move the process forward , to give these people their rights . "
He said they would be given military and civilian defence lawyers and would have the right of appeal .
In listing more details of the charges against the defendants , Gen Hartmann alleged that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had proposed the attacks to al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 1996 , had obtained funding and overseen the operation and the training of hijackers in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
HAVE YOUR SAY Valuable intelligence and sources may be revealed during the trials Liz , Washington DC Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , a Kuwaiti of Pakistani extraction , was said to have been al - Qaeda 's third in command when he was captured in Pakistan in March 2003 .
He has reportedly admitted to decapitating kidnapped US journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002 but these charges do not relate to that .
The BBC's Vincent Dowd in Washington says Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has said he planned every part of the 9/11 attacks but that his confession may prove problematic as the CIA admitted using controversial " waterboarding " techniques .
Human rights groups regard the procedure as torture .
US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told the BBC the trials would be fair .
Asked if evidence obtained from waterboarding - a controversial interrogation technique that simulates drowning - would be used , he said : " The judges will decide what 's reasonably admissible and what 's not admissible . "
Legal challenge
The charges will now be sent to Susan Crawford , the convening authority for the military commissions , to determine whether they will be referred to trial .
THE CHARGES
Conspiracy , murder in violation of the law of war , attacking civilians , attacking civilian objects , intentionally causing serious bodily injury , destruction of property in violation of the law of war , terrorism and providing material support for terrorism ( all six defendants )
Hijacking or hazarding a vessel ( four defendants only - Ramzi Binalshibh , Walid Bin Attash , Ali Abd al - Aziz Ali and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed )
Q&A : Guantanamo trials
Any trials would be held by military tribunal under the terms of the Military Commissions Act , passed by the US Congress in 2006 .
The Act set up tribunals to try terror suspects who were not US citizens .
The law is being challenged by two prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , who say they are being deprived of their rights to have their cases heard by a US civilian court .
Responding to the new charges , a representative of Mohammed al - Qahtani said they would create " show trials " .
Centre for Constitutional Rights in New York executive director Vincent Warren said : " These trials will be using evidence obtained by torture as a means to convict someone and execute them and that is absolutely abhorrent to what we believe in here in America . ''
Nineteen men hijacked four planes in the 9/11 attacks .
Two planes hit the World Trade Center in New York , another the Pentagon in Washington and the fourth crashed in Pennsylvania .

An Australian special operations soldier has been killed and four others wounded during a firefight with the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Father - of - two Lance Corporal Jason Marks , 27 , of the Sydney - based 4RAR ( Commando ) unit , was named as the dead soldier by Defence Force chief Angus Houston at a media briefing this morning .
Lance Corporal Marks was in the lead platoon preparing for a " company - level " assault 25 kilometres to the south - east of Tarin Kowt when they were attacked by the Taliban , Air Chief Marshal Houston said .
SAN FRANCISCO 
It is the burning question in tech circles , and Mike Murphy answers it before it is completed .
" I hear it every time I 'm on a ( tech ) panel , " Murphy , Facebook 's vice president of media sales , says with a wry smile .
STORY : Social networks vs. TV networks
He 's referring to the inevitable question on when Facebook and other social - networking sites will turn their steep market valuations into mounds of currency .
( Invariably , Murphy answers that Facebook has a long list of major advertisers . )
Facebook , MySpace and other social - networking sites have been the rage of the tech industry for more than a year .
Following investments by Microsoft and News Corp. , the companies are valued in the billions of dollars and are considered blueprints for how to build a website .
Yet a deeper question lingers :
How are they going to consistently produce profits to match their soaring valuations ?
It is a parlor game that has Silicon Valley buzzing .
With online ad spending booming into a nearly $ 50 billion market this year , there is plenty of money to be had .
Big - name advertisers are drooling over millions of young , affluent consumers who are spending more time on their online profiles than in front of TV and movie screens .
They are particularly smitten with the prospect of tailoring ads to people 's specific interests .
But Google commands a sizable chunk of the market — especially in the USA — leaving dozens of social - networking sites to scramble for a piece of the advertising pie .
Plus , there is the ticklish task of sites and advertisers pitching products without trampling the privacy of consumers .
Short of striking it rich with online ads or creating a new revenue stream , how can so many sites leverage their vast audiences ?
In many respects , it is the same query that dogged portal companies in the mid-1990s and search engines in the early '90s .
Some were sold .
Some went public .
Some went belly up .
The ongoing challenge is to concoct a potion — be it through banner ads , premium subscriptions or licensing agreements — that no one has perfected .
Facebook , crown jewel of the field , is valued at $ 15 billion but barely turns a profit .
" You can't have a $ 15 billion market valuation based on advertising alone , " says Bill Eager , co-founder of bSocial Networks , a maker of software that helps social - networking users market to each other .
" It 's the single most - asked question in this field . "
Forrester Research analyst Charlene Li has pondered the next stage for social networks .
She envisions the ubiquitous sites will , in five to 10 years , " be like air :
They will be anywhere and everywhere we need and want them to be . "
Eager estimates there will be as many as 250,000 sites that call themselves social networks within a year , compared with about 850 today .
" Everyone will reposition their site to take advantage of this phenomenon .
It happened before with portals . "
To get there , though , there is that little matter of making money .
" Facebook 's real problem is n't privacy , it 's monetization , " says Dave McClure , a start - up adviser and angel investor in Silicon Valley .
" It 's not too early to worry about how Facebook makes money . "
Murphy and other Facebook executives are well aware of that concern .
" Advertisers follow people , " says Sheryl Sandberg , a former Google executive who recently was named Facebook 's chief operating officer .
" We have 70 million active members .
Once you have engaged users , the revenue will follow in that order . "
The Web economy Seth Goldstein , whose company SocialMedia Networks helps create ads for social - networking sites , says sound economics underpin the hype of social networks .
" More and more people are spending more and more of their time within the Facebook ecosystem , " Goldstein says .
" This is the largest aggregated , engaged audience .
Period . "
Social networks present an enormous opportunity — maybe the biggest in tech since e-mail .
The sites have simplified and amplified connections between people online , creating a thriving ecosystem of small programs that let friends interact through games , greetings , video clips and more .
Nonetheless , a fundamental challenge is that the networks often are " walled gardens , " closed to the rest of the Web .
Avid Internet users must maintain separate accounts on different social networks , blogs , photo - sharing sites and instant - messaging services .
In each case , they must invite the same friends to each separate service .
Services such as AOL and CompuServe were early walled gardens before they became widely available websites .
The same with early e-mail services and instant - messages .
Last week , both MySpace and Facebook addressed the issue by announcing they will soon let users share profile data with other websites .
" We 're taking those walls down , " says Amit Kapur , MySpace 's COO .
Facebook will let members take their personal profiles to any website that wants to host them .
For now , MySpace is opening user profiles only to a few sites , including Yahoo and eBay .
Social networks are the latest iteration of the Web economy .
But unlike e-commerce sites and search engines , they offer a more intimate setting for friends to share information .
It is also conceivable that social networking , like e-mail , will never make piles of cash .
Facebook 's ambitious plan to reshape advertising — via a new approach to social marketing , called Beacon — was a bust .
The idea was to inform friends whenever a Facebook member purchased something from online retailers .
When consumers protested its invasion of privacy , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the miscue and promptly apologized .
Even Google , as close to a money mint as anything online , has struggled .
Google has a deal with Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp. to place ads on MySpace , and owns Orkut , which flopped in the USA .
Co-founder Sergey Brin recently admitted the " monetization work we were doing there did n't pan out as well as we had hoped . "
" No one has done for social media what Overture and Google did for search , " says Martin Green , vice president of business at Meebo , an instant - messaging program that works across multiple IM services .
" There needs to be an AdWords for ( social networks ) , " says David Carlick , a partner at VantagePoint Venture Partners , referencing Google 's ad system that displays text ads related to search terms .
So far , several players have managed to cash in to varying degrees : • MySpace .
Since it scored a $ 900 million , three - year deal with Google in 2006 , MySpace has been profitable .
And it has given News Corp.
a nice turn on its $ 650 million acquisition in 2005 ; Richard Greenfield , an analyst at Pali Capital , expects MySpace to haul in $ 700 million to $ 800 million in revenue in fiscal 2008 , mostly in advertising .
MySpace last month forged partnerships with major record labels Sony BMG Music Entertainment , Warner Music Group and Vivendi's Universal Music Group to offer its 117 million members tickets , ring tones and artist merchandise .
Driving a good chunk of sales is a project launched last summer called HyperTargeting , software that mines the profiles of MySpace users to deliver ads tailored to their interests .
Hundreds of advertisers are part of the program , including Toyota and Taco Bell .
Another income source is the sale of mobile ring tones and ads .
MySpace is n't through .
It is " definitely looking into subscription services " and emerging international markets such as India and Japan , says CEO Chris DeWolfe .
• Facebook .
Despite some hand - wringing over its fate , Facebook stacks up well compared with Google at the same juncture in its history .
Facebook hopes to double its revenue to $ 300 million to $ 350 million this year , its fourth of existence .
Google 's revenue soared fivefold , to $ 440 million , in its fourth year .
The 70 million - member network has ramped up revenue with the sale of banner ads through an agreement with Microsoft , targeted - ad programs for local businesses and the sale of virtual gifts .
Those gifts , such as a birthday cake or a popping cork of champagne , are affixed to a user 's profile in the manner that someone would sign a high school yearbook .
" We believe there will be a diversity of revenue — with brand - name advertisers , local advertisers and direct - response advertisers , " says Chamath Palihapitiya , Facebook 's vice president of product marketing .
• LinkedIn .
The business - contact site has built a booming business in five years through banner ads from the likes of Porsche and Microsoft ; subscriptions ; job postings charged to corporations and small - business owners ; and corporate sales to Symantec , MTV and others .
LinkedIn is developing other revenue streams , including research services to locate experts .
" It is a global , interconnected world , and we are the one professional network , " says CEO Dan Nye .
The 250 - person company boasts 21 million members and is adding 1.2 million per month .
Social - networking site Bebo , recently acquired by AOL for a knee - buckling $ 850 million , is parlaying its popularity with a predominantly young audience — many are 13 to 24 years old .
It has struck up marketing initiatives with advertisers such as Nike and Apple , says Ziv Navoth , vice president of marketing and business development at Bebo , which has 43 million users .
That is a key reason it has been profitable the past 18 months .
• Vertical social networks .
Social networks that cater to the specialized interests of their members offer a premium of eyeballs and opportunity for advertisers , who want a safe , well - lit place they know and trust .
" If you have the right audience and the right engagement , you can build a real media business , " says Tina Sharkey , CEO of BabyCenter .
For most social networks , the goal is to carve out a niche where they fit in a market dominated by generalists MySpace , Facebook and Bebo , says Aaron Levie , CEO of Box.net , an online file system .
So far , several have .
Imeemhas established itself as a music and media social - networking site with 25 million unique visitors each month .
Xing , a business - contact list service popular in Europe , says its revenue doubled in 2007 — to $ 30 million , from 2006 — because of premium subscriptions , an e-commerce marketplace and banner ads .
Meanwhile , Ning , a free platform for do - it - yourself social networks , has helped create more than 260,000 networks .
The company estimates that , by the end of 2010 , it will host some 4 million social networks , with tens of millions of members , serving up billions of page views daily .
Show me the money.com Opportunities abound .
Though the U.S. market is largely sewn up among the Big 3 of MySpace , Facebook and Linked In , the international market is wide open .
China alone has jolted to $ 1 billion in online ads last year from nothing a few years ago .
ZenithOptimedia estimates online ad spending worldwide will soar 26.5 % this year , to $ 47.7 billion .
Total ad spending worldwide , by comparison , is expected to grow 4.6 % , to $ 653.9 billion this year , says Universal McCann .
It wo n't be easy , with so many social networks slugging it out .
" The pressure is to scale up revenue and then show a profit , " says Kent Lindstrom , president of Friendster , the one - time red - hot social network in the USA that has since become popular in Asia , with nearly 50 million members .
Speculation veers from the dire to the giddy .
" Honeymoon is over for social networks .
They need to start generating revenue now or bow out of the race , " according to a new report from In - Stat .
Yet Venture capitalists are taking bets on the IPO possibilities for Slide , a maker of widgets for Facebook and MySpace , among others .
SocialMedia CEO
Goldstein is betting it will be late this year or early 2009 when name - brand advertisers flock to Facebook , Slide , Ning and others .
Coincidentally , that 's when investors expect revenue to ramp up .
Silicon Valley is keenly aware of the vagaries of empty dot - com promises .
Just ask any of the once - promising start - ups in the portal and e-commerce markets that were eviscerated amid high hopes and low revenue .
Plus , there is the specter of impatient investors .
Some sites could draw millions of customers , but if they are short on funding there is n't much they can do , analysts say .
" The clock is ticking , " says Emily Riley , senior analyst at JupiterResearch .
" If they do n't have enough volume ( users ) to land premium ads and charge per page view , game over . "

I am Sick of Conservophobes
This is the shit that I really get sick and tired of hearing and reading about .
David Plouffe( Obama ’s Campaign Manager ) tells Linda Douglass that real racists are probably voting Republican in any case : “ [ T ] he vast , vast majority of voters who would not vote for Barack Obama in November based on race are probably firmly in John McCain ’s camp already , ” he says .
Somebody please explain to me why it is perfectly acceptable to hold stereotypes and prejudices such as the one above against conservative Republicans .
Why is it that conservatives are the only group where it is not only acceptable to be bigoted towards , it is encouraged by people in the Democrat party ?
When liberals such as Obama ’s campaign manager use rhetoric like he did above , where he claims that people who would vote against Obama because he is black are voting Republican anyway , he is calling us racists .
This is an old , worn out stereotype and I am getting sick and fucking tired of having to listen to this bullshit time and time again .
Last time I checked it is only Democrats who are voting against Obama right now , why are these people not considered racists ?
Because they are liberals and can’t possibly be racists ?
If you do n’t think there are racists on both sides of the aisle you are just fooling yourself .
People who paint conservatives with a broad brush and call us racists are nothing but conservophobes .
They are afraid of our ideas so they try to devalue us and our ideas .
Well , I for one am tired of it .
I am tired of the bigotry being levied towards us .
I am tired of how it is not considered wrong to stereotype us .
Every other group in this country is now protected .
I want the equal protection under the law that everyone else receives .
Republicans are n’t voting for Obama , that is true Mr. Plouffe , but it is because they do n’t agree with his ideology , not because of the color of his skin .
If you ca n’t separate the two then it is you who are the bigot .
You are bigoted against conservatives .
You are a conservophobe .
I am sick of conservophobes , and I grow tired of their old , boring , useless , tired , false accusations against us .
It is nothing but a ploy to distract voters from the issues we face .
Debate us on the issues and stop the political games .
We know you conservophobes do n’t like us , but what are you afraid of ?

If the Ohio Democratic primary contest between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton was , in part , the Battle of NAFTA , voters in Pennsylvania can expect a rematch as the two candidates head toward the April 22 primary .
Like Ohio , Pennsylvania is a beleaguered industrial state that has suffered the damaging fallout of globalization , losing , by one estimate , more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 2001 .
“ There is no way to avoid this issue in the Pennsylvania primary , ” Lori Wallach , director of Public Citizen ’s Global Trade Watch , says of NAFTA , “ and it will only become a brighter line wedge issue in the general election . ”
Consequently , the continued success of Hillary Clinton ’s bait - and - switch tactics on the subject of the North American Free Trade Agreement might have a decisive impact on the primary race .
In Ohio , she pulled off a remarkable political feat :
While her last name alone should have made her vulnerable on free trade , she countered by campaigning against NAFTA .
“ Let ’s get real about NAFTA , ” she told a cheering audience in economically devastated Youngstown .
“ I ’m going to fix it . ”
Then she blasted what she claimed was her opponent ’s inconsistent position on NAFTA , a pseudoscandal that her campaign quickly dubbed NAFTA - gate .
Both Clinton and Obama have adjusted their statements on NAFTA to suit their audiences , and it ’s not certain that either would do much to change this or other existing free trade agreements .
Yet heading into Pennsylvania ( and after it , other hard - hit manufacturing states like Indiana and West Virginia ) , Clinton still seeks to portray herself as a working - class heroine , the candidate who can triumph in the Rust Belt states that may prove crucial in November .
By doing so , she surpassed her opponent in the rhetoric / reality gap , betting her presidential fortunes on winning the hearts and minds of the very people her husband ’s policies betrayed — on the very issue that epitomized that betrayal .
Hillary Clinton ’s own words show clear , long - standing , and largely uncritical support for NAFTA .
But beyond this , she has been running hard on her husband ’s record , taking a share of the credit for everything good that happened in the 1990s , from the economic recovery to peace in Northern Ireland .
Yet she now seeks to disavow what may be the single most significant and emblematic event of Bill Clinton ’s presidency .
When he signed the agreement in 1994 , with a stroke of the pen Bill Clinton abandoned part of the Democratic Party ’s core constituency and signed the party on to the neoliberal agenda of the Democratic Leadership Council ( DLC ) , heralding a new approach to both domestic economic policy and foreign policy .
NAFTA , perhaps more than anything else , is Bill Clinton ’s legacy .
Hillary Clinton has sought to downplay her husband ’s responsibility for NAFTA .
In the same Ohio news conference where she declared “ Shame on you , Barack Obama ” for distributing flyers misrepresenting her NAFTA position , Hillary asserted that “ the agreement was negotiated in the Bush administration .
It was passed in the Clinton administration . ”
A year earlier , she told a Time magazine interviewer that “ NAFTA was inherited by the Clinton administration , ” and that while it was “ in principle , a good idea to try to create a better trading market between Canada and the United States and Mexico , ” there were problems with “ the terms that it contained , and how it was negotiated under the Bush administration and the failure to have any tough enforcement mechanism . ”
While the basic terms for NAFTA were indeed negotiated under George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton was a fervent advocate for the agreement , the man who pushed it through Congress , where the strongest resistance came from his own party .
Clinton himself would say , in a 1995 interview with Tom Brokaw , “ We took on the NAFTA fight .
It was deader than a doornail when I became president , and we brought it back to life . ”
After NAFTA was approved , in large part with Republican votes , Clinton declared , “ The truth of our age is this and must be this : Open and competitive commerce will enrich us as a nation . ”
The corporations and well - off Americans who were indeed enriched in the 1990s would find little reason to question such claims .
But those left behind by the boom times may have had a better sense of what NAFTA really represented : a fundamental Democratic policy shift toward the long - held Republican position that a rising tide would lift all boats , and that endless growth through a deregulated capitalist economy and expanded markets was the cure for all ills .
It was a lot closer to Reaganomics than it was to the New Deal .
By the end of his presidency , Clinton would sign nearly 300 trade agreements .
He championed extending Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China — a move that would have a wider economic impact than NAFTA — and presided over American entry into the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , of which he said , “ It creates hundreds of thousands of high - paying American jobs … .
It is the largest international tax cut in history .
Most importantly , this agreement requires all trading nations to play by the same rules .
And since the United States has the most productive and competitive economy in the world , that is good news for our workers and our future . ”
It was n’t good news for everyone , but a few million American manufacturing jobs were small matters in the context of the larger vision of which NAFTA was a vital part .
In his book American Empire , Andrew J. Bacevich , the former director of Boston University ’s Center for International Relations , notes that NAFTA was a cornerstone of Bill Clinton ’s foreign policy .
Clinton was the first president to take office in a post - Cold War world , and his campaign mentioned both the genocide in Bosnia and human rights violations in China as appropriate targets for intervention by the world ’s sole superpower ; but once in office , he eased off of both positions .
As Bacevich points out , NAFTA and subsequent trade agreements were crucial to the administration ’s overall international strategy , which Clinton ’s National Security Advisor , Anthony Lake ( now an Obama advisor ) , described in a 1993 speech at Johns Hopkins called “ From Containment to Enlargement . ”
Having won the battle against the Soviet Union , the United States would now work for the “ enlargement of the world ’s free community of market democracies ” in a global movement toward democracy and market economics — which were seen as inseparable .
This strategy , Lake said , would make the world a “ more humane and peaceful ” place , but it was hardly a humanitarian venture , since it would also make the United States “ more secure , prosperous , and influential . ”
The strategy Lake set out , Bacevich observes , was a plan to “ preserve and reinforce American preeminence ” — a blueprint for a new kind of American empire .
The author Chalmers Johnson , a longtime critic of the American empire , said in an email exchange that Bill Clinton “ conducted an essentially Republican foreign policy . ”
Clinton “ was rapacious toward the third world , particularly Latin America , ” he says , “ but always under cover of ‘ globalization , ’ technological factors , the imperatives of neoliberal ideology .
He put blatant pressure on Latin American countries to buy American weaponry .
He was always dissimulating that ‘ the market made me do it . ' ”
Johnson mentions Clinton ’s preservation of worldwide military bases , handouts to defense contractors , and failed “ structural adjustment ” policies in the developing world , concluding that “ Clinton ran the prototype of the neocons ’ foreign policy but always with the pretense of liberal intent . ”
All of this , of course , falls under what some have called triangulation , and what the Clintons and others in the Democratic Leadership Council call the New Democratic Agenda .
Hatched in the 1980s , the DLC ’s theory was that the party had to move away from the New Deal , economic populism , and what was seen as the excessive influence of its left wing — including organized labor , people of color , feminists , gays and lesbians , and peace activists — and promote “ mainstream values , and innovative , non-bureaucratic , market - based solutions . ”
At the DLC ’s 2002 “ National Conversation , ” Hillary Clinton said , “ We all know the record of the DLC , the Progressive Policy Institute and , of course , the Clinton - Gore administration .
The economic recovery plan stands first and foremost as a testament to both good ideas and political courage .
National service .
The Brady Bill .
Family Leave .
NAFTA .
Investment in science and technology .
New markets .
Charter schools .
The Earned Income Tax Credit .
The welfare to work partnership … .
All of these came out of some very fundamental ideas about what would work .
The results speak for themselves .
Those ideas were converted into policies programs that literally changed millions of lives and , I argue , changed America . ”
Any notion that Hillary Clinton ’s views differ in some profound way from the DLC ’s — or from her husband ’s — on such a key issue as free trade should be put to rest by her own statements .
Hillary ’s few public proclamations on NAFTA during her years as first lady are unabashedly positive .
At a 1996 meeting with members of the garment workers ’ union UNITE , Clinton said , in a clip caught on video , “ I think everybody is in favor of free and fair trade .
I think NAFTA is proving its worth . ”
According to an AP report on the candidate ’s NAFTA positions , Clinton said the deal “ was giving U.S. workers a chance to compete , ” declaring , “ that ’s what a free and fair trade agreement like NAFTA is all about . ”
In support of Hillary Clinton ’s claim that she actually opposed NAFTA during those early years in the White House are a handful of statements from secondary sources .
Biographer Carl Bernstein ( on CNN , discussing why John Edwards supporters should switch to Hillary ) said , “ She was against NAFTA , ” and expressed his wish that “ she would somehow come out and tell the real story of what she fought for in the White House and failed in a big argument with her husband . ”
Another biographer , Sally Bedell Smith , also says she “ opposed it . ”
But a primary objection to the trade pact , it appears , was that it would sideline her health care initiative .
Smith writes :
It fell to Mickey Kantor , the U.S. Trade Representative …to reason with Hillary .
One day in August , he sat her down on a bench behind the White House and tried to strike a compromise .
“ I said , ‘ If you want to drop NAFTA , we can kill it , but we should n’t , ' ” Kantor recalled .
“ I said , ‘ The way to do it is to introduce health care , spend a month on it , and then do NAFTA , then go back to health care . ' ”
With misgivings , Hillary acquiesced to the proposed sequence .
According to then - labor secretary Robert Reich , Hillary ’s objections were all about sequence .
Reich , who claims to “ remember her position quite precisely , ” says on his blog :
HRC did n’t want the Administration to move forward with NAFTA , but not because she was opposed to NAFTA as a policy .
She opposed NAFTA because of its timing .
She wanted her health - care plan to be voted on first .
She feared that the fight over NAFTA would use up so much of the White House ’s political capital that there would n’t be enough left when it came to pushing for health care .
In her own 2003 memoir , Living History , Hillary writes that she simply did n’t want her health care plan delayed for the sake of NAFTA , but voices no objections to the trade agreement itself : “ Creating a free trade zone in North America — the largest free trade zone in the world — would expand U.S. exports , create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits , not the burdens , of globalization .
Although unpopular with labor unions , expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal .
The question was whether the White House could focus its energies on two legislative campaigns at once .
I argued that we could and that postponing health care would further weaken its chances . ”
Hillary Clinton may now pledge to “ fix ” NAFTA by making some adjustments around the edges , renegotiating terms , and improving enforcement .
But her husband made similar promises in order to get the agreement passed .
Reports from Public Citizen to the Wall Street Journal have documented the fact that those environmental and labor protections never had much impact due to both inherent weaknesses and a lack of enforcement under Bill Clinton as well as under George W. Bush .
Hillary promises to do better , and perhaps she will .
But unless she separates herself from the DLC — where she is currently identified as one of seven members of the “ leadership team ” — it ’s impossible to imagine her doing more than some harmless tinkering .
And at this point , 14 years after the first Clinton opened the door to the bracing wind of free trade , it will take a lot more than that to help people in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania , or , as the popular slogan goes , to make free trade into fair trade .
Global Trade Watch ’s Lori Wallach says that “ most Americans still have no idea how NAFTA and the WTO hijacked the good name of trade to lavish market - distorting protections and subsidies on the corporations that helped write those deals and to impose limits on import safety standards and inspection . ”
The United States is subject to WTO rules , which supercede U.S. law , and the corporate interests they serve are funding the presidential campaigns .
So any candidate who proposes to address the ravages of globalization had better be serious about it .
Barack Obama , who remains basically a business - friendly centrist despite being free of DLC ties , is unlikely to have the will to do what it would take .
Hillary Clinton , who for all her populist rhetoric has New Democratic blood coursing through her veins , certainly does n’t .
Anyone hoping for relief , then , had best take Hillary ’s own advice : Let ’s get real about NAFTA .
Shiite Muslim religious leaders ratcheted up their rhetoric against the U.S. during Friday prayers amid ongoing sectarian violence and faltering talks over the creation of a new Iraqi government .
One leading Shiite cleric , Ayatollah Mohammed Yacoubi , called on Washington to remove U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad , who is perceived by some Shiites as biased in favor of Kurds , Sunni Arabs and secular Iraqis .
The United States “ should not yield to terrorist blackmail and should not be deluded or misled by spiteful sectarians , ” he said in a statement read at mosques , according to the Reuters news agency .
“ It should replace its ambassador to Iraq if it wants to protect itself from further failures . ”
The occasionally vitriolic anti-American sermons , many delivered by clerics close to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr , were the latest sign of souring relations between U.S. political and military leaders and the country ’s majority sect , which initially welcomed the U.S. effort to topple the Sunni-led regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003 .

Shiite political parties , many of them with religious and family ties to powerful clerical clans in shrine cities in Iran as well as Iraq , have been angered by U.S. efforts to broker a compromise between Iraq ’s squabbling political blocs .
Kurds , Sunni Arabs and a secular coalition led by former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi oppose the Shiite nomination of interim Prime Minister Ibrahim Jafari for a full term in office .
This week a Shiite politician leaked word that President Bush had sent a message through Khalilzad that he , too , opposed Jafari ’s candidacy , a move that angered Shiite leaders .
Khalilzad , speaking to a group of Iraqi women Friday inside the tightly secured Green Zone , took his own swipe at Iraqi politicians .
“ Iraq is bleeding while they are moving at a very slow pace , ” he said , according to a transcript provided by the U.S. Embassy .

Shiite religious leaders throughout the country also condemned a U.S. - Iraqi raid on a Shiite house of worship in northern Baghdad on Sunday that left at least 16 dead .
“ This grisly crime was committed by the occupier and its mercenaries , ” prayer leader Mohammed Tabatabai told worshipers in Sadr City , a Shiite slum in Baghdad .
“ America is taking on the role of pharaoh to the world .
America came to kill the believers . ”
Other Shiite leaders called on the Iraqi government to stop sectarian attacks on Shiite villagers in the countryside .
The International Organization for Migration , a multinational group that helps refugees , estimates that at least 4,000 families throughout the country have been displaced by sectarian violence or fear .
In Basra , Sheik Abdul Karim Ghizzi demanded that the government help Shiite victims .
“ We condemn and denounce the disastrous security situation in the country , ” he told worshipers .

Iraq ’s Sunni Arabs , once viewed as the primary perpetrators of ethnic violence , have increasingly become victims as shadowy groups with possible ties to official security organizations have launched a campaign of abduction and killing .
Authorities discovered at least five corpses Friday , at least three of them with handcuffs and signs of torture in what has become the signature of the death squads operating in religiously mixed provinces of central Iraq .
Commandos of the Shiite - led Interior Ministry as well as Iraqi soldiers were said to have arrested the husband of a Sunni legislator Thursday night .
“ A large number of forces in 15 cars came in armored cars and ambulances , ” Amal Siham Qadhi , a Sunni elected official , said Friday .
“ He was arrested without charges and without any warrant from a judge . ”

At the Umm Qura Mosque , among the country ’s most important Sunni houses of worship , Sheik Mahmoud Sumaidaie called for help from other Arab countries .
He criticized leaders of countries such as Egypt who did not attend the recent Arab League summit in Khartoum , the capital of Sudan , a forum that was to focus this year on the crisis in Iraq .
“ Other nations have interests in Iraq , so they interfere , ” Sumaidaie told worshipers in an unsubtle swipe at Shiite Iran .
“ They kill , detonate and plot while the Arab leaders are asleep at their summit . ”
Insurgents killed at least three Iraqis in Baghdad on Friday as an 8 p.m. curfew went into effect .
Rockets and mortar rounds struck several neighborhoods in the capital , killing two and injuring two .
Insurgents killed a police officer in downtown Baghdad .
Two car bombs in southern Baghdad injured six .
In the northern city of Bayji , relatives and friends of eight employees of an electricity generation plant who were killed Thursday set up funeral tents .
The men were driving home from work when they were ambushed by gunmen , said Lt. Mohaned Ahmed of the Bayji police .

The NATO Summit Germany Puts the Brakes on US Expansion Plans
US President George W. Bush wants to bring more Eastern European countries into the military alliance at the upcoming NATO summit .
But Germany is thwarting his plans , because of concerns about Ukraine and Georgia -- and in deference to Russia .
A surgical team in Calgary on Friday extolled the virtues of using a robotic arm to perform groundbreaking surgery to remove a woman 's brain tumour .
Paige Nickason , 21 , was discharged from the Foothills Medical Centre after surgery Monday by Dr. Garnette Sutherland of the University of Calgary .
" Paige 's brain surgery represents a technical achievement in the use of image - guided robotic technology to remove a relatively complex brain tumour , " Sutherland told a press conference .
" This is wonderful and represents the beginning of something new in surgical care , " he said .
" I had to have the tumour removed anyway , so I was happy to help by being a part of this historical surgery , " Nickason said in a press release on Friday .
Mimic surgeon 's movements
The two mechanical hands of the robot , known as NeuroArm , mimic the movements of the surgeon with incredible precision while sensors and microphones recreate the sights , sounds and touch of surgery .
A surgeon is able to control the robot using levers at a computer workstation in a room next to the surgery .
Sutherland said human ability to manipulate robotic surgery techniques can be credited , at least in part , to the explosion in popularity of video games .
" We would all agree that our young children who have become immersed in video games represent the future generation of surgeons , " he said .
" [ They ] will be experienced in the integration of hand controllers with images and … will have enhanced hand - eye co-ordination with highly developed spatial orientation . "
The technology works in conjunction with real - time magnetic resonance imaging , or MRI , to provide surgeons with unprecedented detail and the control to manipulate tools at a microscopic scale for operations ranging from repairs of blood vessels to removal of brain tumours .
Precision , accuracy , dexterity improving
Microsurgical techniques that evolved in the 1960s have pushed surgeons to the limits of their precision , accuracy , dexterity and stamina , Sutherland said in April , with the world 's best surgeons being able to get within three millimetres of the mark .
The arm was designed and built in collaboration with engineers at MacDonald , Dettwiler and Associates , known for creating Canadarm and Canadarm2 for NASA .
It 's a crisp spring day here in Southern California , and as such I decided to drink a spring seasonal beer .
Specifically , I have here a glass of Springboard Ale from New Belgium Brewery .
According to the description on the side of the bottle , Springboard Ale " combines oats , ancient Chinese herbs and Mt. Hood hops to maintain a balanced equilibrium for such an exhilarating ale .
This cloudy blonde has a spirited threshold , and a creamy body , followed by a refreshingly dry finish . "
The front of the label says that it 's a blend of 98 % ale brewed with Wormwood Lycium and Schisandra , and 2 % ale aged in oak barrels .
Let 's see if all that verbiage adds up to a tasty beverage .
The pour : well , it certainly is a cloudy blonde .
There 's a big head that comes up as I finish pouring , and then just as quickly fades away to lace .
I must have poured it too quickly , because there 's a layer of yeast left in the bottom of the bottle .
The aroma : it 's almost fruity , actually , which I did n't expect from the description on the label .
The main aroma seems to be lemon , but not a hoppy lemon peel .
There 's no malt to speak of .
It certainly smells like a seasonal brewed for springtime .
The taste :
They nailed the description of the body - it is very creamy .
There 's almost no carbonation , which is kind of strange in a beer with this delicate of a flavor .
The first flavor to hit you is a very light malt , not the strong toasted biscuit that I 've come to expect from New Belgium beers .
After that is the creamy section of the beer , which has that lemon flavor and also some very light hops .
The aftertaste is almost tangy , which I think comes from the herbs but I can't be sure .
Overall this beer is very different from anything I 've ever had from New Belgium .
That 's not a bad thing ; it 's always good to see that a brewer is trying new things .
The rating : .
The flavors , once you can pick them out ( they 're very faint ) , work well together .
The reason that it did n't get a higher rating is this : when a seasonal has a light , almost fruity flavor like this , I 'm looking for it to be refreshing , a warm day kind of beer .
This one almost gets there , but the aftertaste detracts from that a bit and the drinkability suffers as a result .
I think the Chinese herbs take away from my enjoyment of the beer .
Your mileage may vary , of course , and I 'd say it 's worth buying a 6 - pack and trying it .
Labels : beer
Representations of the human skeleton are , however , probably more ubiquitous in present - day Western culture .
Whether visiting art galleries or going to the mall , it ’s hard to avoid skulls and ribcages : you see them in art installations , on posters , T - shirts , umbrellas , and even baby bibs .
A time - traveler from the seventeenth century would be stunned : twenty - first - century people seem to ponder their own mortality and the vanity of life more obsessively than early modern people who meditated on such things with the help of still lives or figurines .
Or do we ?
Maybe the abundance of manufactured bones have a kind of smoke - screen effect that helps us not to think about death .
By sequestering death in the realm of art , pop culture , and kitsch , maybe we hope to attenuate the certain prospect of our impending mortality : Death becomes just another disposable consumer object , or conversely just another collectible .
Thus accessorized , we no longer get good representational service out of the skeleton as an inner self , which traditionally negated our individuality and pointed to our common identity and fate : there ’s no possibility of transgression .
If so , then the skeleton is gasping its last breath .
Bone play is not as much fun as it used to be .
There are not too many celebrity couples that attract a lot of interest of the media and fans like Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling because of how super - private the couple has been all through the years .
In fact , there are times that one can forget in all genuineness that the two have been together for close to a decade and they have children .
Eva Mendes ’s relationship with Ryan Gosling has been said to have survived the years while still going stronger with time because of how much the two have tried to put themselves as the emphasis of the relationship instead of trying to show off for the media .
While many other celebs flaunt themselves before the lenses of paparazzi , Mendes and Gosling are all private except when it has to do with their career .
Eva Mendes ’s Relationship With Ryan Gosling
It was in 2011 that Ryan and Mendes first met while filming The Place Beyond the Pines .
The two were first spotted working late into the night in September and then they were seen again at Disneyland having a romantic date .
Unlike the elusive pair that we have come to know them as , they were very open with each other , displaying their love with hand - holding and hugs .
In 2012 when Ryan ’s mom , Donna graduated from Brock University with a bachelor ’s degree in education , Ryan brought Eva to Toronto to celebrate the day with his mother .
That was the first time that Eva was seen with any family member of the actor .
By 2013 , no one was in doubt that Eva Mendes ’s relationship with Ryan Gosling was something already on a serious lane .
However , in 2014 , there were rumors that the two had parted ways when they were not seen together for a few months .
The rumor was soon laid to rest after the actor was seen at Eva ’s house .
It did n’t take too long after this that it came out in July that the two were expecting their first child together .
By then , the pregnancy had already advanced and so in September , Eva gave birth to their daughter , Esmeralda Amada .
In April 2016 , Amada Lee Gosling , their second daughter was born .
This time around , everything was kept in secret except for very close friends .
All You Must Know
Apart from the quick timeline on Eva Mendes ’s relationship with Ryan Gosling , here are all the other things to know .
1 . The age difference
Cliche but true , age is only a number .
Gosling was born in 1980 while his better half was born in 1974 , which means that there is the age difference of almost 6 years between them .
2 . There were rumors in the past that they were married
In September 2016 , US Magazine reported that the La La Land actor and Eva had secretly tied the knot in a ceremony that was witnessed by their family and close friends .
However , as it would turn out to be , they were not married .
3 . They are both family oriented
Inasmuch as they have been together since 2011 and are still yet to tie the knot , as far as it is known , the very cryptic couple is very family oriented .
According to Eva , she always prefers to be at home , spending quality time with Ryan and the kids .
4. Eva and Ryan have worked together
While partnering as lovers , Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes have also partnered as actors .
Apart from the first movie that brought them together , they have also worked on Lost River together in 2014 .
She played the role of cabaret performer Cat in the production .
The movie which is the directorial debut of Gosling became one of the last major acting roles of Eva .
She stated in an interview that for now , she is strictly obsessed with her kids that she cannot tell when she is returning to acting .
5 . Home and net worth
The couple now lives in Los Angeles with their two daughters .
While Gosling still works as an actor , producer , and director , Eva who was ranked one of the 100 Sexiest Women in the World by FHM Magazine in 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 , is working as a businesswoman .
She has her fashion line , Eva by Eva Mendes , which is in partner with New York & Co .
On his part , Ryan Gosling has a net worth that is estimated at $ 60 million while the net worth of Mendes is estimated at $ 15 million .
This merger could also speed up another tie - up -- that of Continental Airlines and United Airlines , whose parent is UAL .
Those two carriers have laid most of the groundwork for a merger , two people briefed on the matter said , and could have a deal ready " pretty quickly " following the Delta and Northwest announcement , one of them said earlier Monday .
The Big Carrier
The new Delta Air Lines will still be headquartered in Atlanta and operate under Delta 's flag , but now with over $ 35 billion in annual revenue and about 75,000 employees .
Delta Chief Executive Richard Anderson will lead the combined airline .
Delta 's pilots would get a 3.5 percent equity stake in the new company while U.S. - based non-pilot employees of both airlines would be given a 4 percent equity stake upon closing of the deal .
" It 's a very optimistic view on an industry that 's been very dismal for the last couple of weeks , " said airline consultant Robert Mann .
The deal will combine Delta 's strong Atlanta hub and its trans -Atlantic route network , with Northwest 's extensive Asian presence , including a hub in Tokyo .
There will be no hub closures , Delta said .
Mann said it would be tricky for Delta to deliver on its promise to retain all hubs .
" It would be nice if it were true , " he said .
Northwest Pilots Opposed
Previous talks stalled in February after pilots ' unions at Delta and Northwest failed to agree on how to combine the seniority lists of the two groups .
Delta previously had indicated it would delay merger plans until pilots -- the airline 's only major unionized group -- agreed to an integration deal .
But the airlines have decided to go ahead with the merger to create efficiencies that will offset soaring fuel prices and enable the new carrier to better compete internationally .
Delta and Northwest said the deal promises to generate $ 1 billion in annual revenue and cost synergies .
The Northwest pilots union said in a statement : " This agreement clearly disadvantages NWA pilots both with respect to economic issues and seniority list integration . "
" The NWA MEC will use all resources available to aggressively oppose the merger . "
Delta , the third - largest U.S. carrier and Northwest , the fifth - largest , still have to get the deal past antitrust authorities , which have scuttled previous airline merger proposals , and overcome objections from pilots ' groups and other employee unions .
Ireland is often childishly described as being like a saucer or soup bowl - flat in the middle and raised at the edges .
This is not quite true .
There is a central plain , much of which is occupied by the Bog of Allen .
There are mountains around much of the coast , but these are not " mountains " as most people would expect them .
The tallest is a mere 1000 meters ( 3300 feet ) .
There are also plenty of inland mountains .
The major river is the Shannon which rises in Leitrim , drains most of the midlands and exits into the Atlantic through the Shannon Estuary between counties Limerick and Clare .
The Shannon is the longest river in Ireland or Britain .
The river nowadays is mainly used for leisure purposes , but it has quite a history .
Following the defeat of the Jacobites by the Williamites at the battle of the Boyne in 1691 , James 's army regrouped at Athlone on the west bank of the Shannon and a pitched battled ensued across the river .
Again the Williamites won and following further battles at Aughrim and Limerick ( also on the banks of the Shannon ) the Jabobites were finally subdued .
Two major canals ( the Royal and the Grand ) were built between Dublin and the Shannon , or one if its tributaries and in former centuries these represented the main form of transportation between the capital and the midlands .
The first trans -Atlantic air flights employed huge sea-planes which landed and took off from Foynes in the Shannon estuary .
The power of the river has also been harnessed by a hydro-electric plant at Ardnacrusha .
Sadly many parts of the river and its lakes are polluted today , mainly by run off from farm land .
High levels of nitrogen promote algal bloom .
I 'll tell you what , I do n't have any more of an inside track on our patron saint than anyone else , but I know a line of rubbish when I see it .
For example , from " authoritative " sources I have it that he was born in Scotland / Wales / England / Cornwall / France .
Most agree that he was the son of a wealthy Roman official , but others claim his daddy was a Briton and a churchman and his grand - daddy a priest ( now there 's an auspicious beginning to the church in Ireland ) .
Almost all sources suggest that he was captured during a raid by Irish pirates / brigands / robbers / ne'er - do - wells who sold him into slavery in Antrim .
But Irish folklore as recorded by the Annalists ( who were invariably priests ) attribute his capture to Niall Mór ( Niall of the Nine Hostages ) who was a a bit of a step above pirate , being High King of Ireland .
And , as his name suggests , Niall had a tendency toward taking hostages rather than slaves , so Patrick 's Daddy either was n't as rich as is claimed , or did n't give a toss about his son , as he apparently did n't or could n't fork over the ransom .
It is generally agreed that Patrick was sixteen when captured and remained in Ireland for six years , after which time he escaped .
But his six years in Ireland had apparently imbued him with the , now legendary , Irish homing instinct .
Rather than taking the short trip from Scotland / Wales / England / Cornwall / France , he decided on the scenic route ( another Irish trait ) and came back via Rome , becoming a priest en route .
On fire with the Christian spirit , he returned to Ireland to convert the pagan natives , which task he achieved singlehandedly , using various forms of trickery including snake banishing , bonfire lighting and slight of hand with shamrocks .
By the time of his death , the whole island was converted and the Irish went on to further convert the rest of the world !
Sorry , but this simply does n't wash .
Though Ireland is not big , there is no way that one man could walk it in a lifetime , taking sufficient time to convert everyone he met along the way .
My gut feeling on Patrick is that he was probably a good story teller .
The native Irish liked nothing more than a good story - in fact the same holds true today .
The story of Christianity , even if you are not Christian , is a good one .
I can picture in my mind 's eye Patrick sitting around the fire in the evening relating the stories of the bible to the locals of the day and their being fascinated by them .
The Irish never had much of a written tradition and employed bards to pass down their folklore .
After hundreds of years of spinning the same yarns , these guys must have beeen thrilled to have a new story to tell .
I have to believe that this is how Patrick managed to spread his message .
As it spread , it became intermingled with the local lore , so Yule became Christmas , the goddess of Spring was replaced by Mary ( later repersonified as Saint Brigid ) , etc .
I 'd need Donna here to give me the entire list of " pagan " festivals that have been christianised .
Side note : the Roman Church was very much male oriented , but the Celtic Irish viewed men and women as equal , which view persisted in Brehon Law up until the arrival of the Normans in the 12th century .
I am convinced that it was the Irish missionaries who later spread out all over Europe , that elevated the position of women within the church and elevated Mary and the female saints to recognised positions .
So , my take on St. Patrick is that there probably was such a person but that the man honoured today and about whom all the various stories are told is probably a amalgam of many people .
Some observations about Saint Patrick 's Day - March 17th 1 . It is basically an American Holiday .
Americans who come to Ireland for the day must be really dissappointed .
The last time I actually watched a parade ( in Dublin ) I really felt sorry for the poor majorettes , with their short skirts and bare legs being blasted by icy snow showers .
2 . Stop calling it St. Patty 's Day !!!!
Patty is not an acceptable abbreviation of Patrick ( though it may be an abbreviation of Patricia ) .
Besides , a patty is akin to a burger and this is German !
Not even the wildest stories have Saint Patrick being German .
Acceptable abbreviations are St. Paddy ( unless you are English ) and St. Pat .
3 . The legend that " real " shamrock only grows on Irish soil is nonsense .
All species of Trifolium and Medicago ( the botanical species worn as shamrock ) will grow practically anywhere .
It 's almost impossible to find growing wild in Ireland before March 17th , but from March 18th onwards it spreads like wildfire - especially in my lawn and flower beds .
4 . The best way to spend St. Patrick 's Day is in front of a nice fire , outside of a nice hot whiskey !
5 . In Ireland , corned beef , cabbage and potatoes is NOT the traditional St. Patrick 's Day meal .
In fact , corned beef is almost impossible to find outside Dublin .
Bacon and cabbage is probably much more traditional , but there is no traditional St. Patrick 's Day meal .
6 . Green beer is an American invention .
The only time I ever saw green beer in Ireland is when I once left an undrunk pint sit undisturbed for a month .
7 . The coming of St. Patrick 's Day is like a starter pistol to Irish politicians in their lemming - like rush to evacuate the country .
8 . St. Patrick 's Day is , to the Irish tourism industry , a bit like Groundhog Day to Americans .
They look outside and if they do n't see the shadows of tourists , they go back to sleep for another six weeks .
9 . Patrick is no longer the most popular personal name for boys in Ireland - it is Connor .
Do n't get me started on Saint Connor !!!
Politics
Sen .
Joe Biden was on ABC 's THIS WEEK and took President Bush and John McCain to the woodshed over their latest attacks on the entire Democratic Party including Barack Obama over their negotiating in any form with Iran .
He busts Bush for being a complete hypocrite .
Wow , who knew ?
Bush asked Biden to negotiate with Gaddafi and he did .
And I think it turned out pretty good .
And since Gates and Condi want to talk with Iran too , what does Biden think about that ?
Fire those appeasers now !
I 'm sure McCain will agree .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
It sounds like you 're calling it hypocrisy .
BIDEN : Well , I should -- I 'm trying to be more polite , but I should n't be .
It was ridiculous .
This is president -- this is pure , unadulterated politics .
And the last point I 'll make -- maybe the president does n't know -- I 'll be a smart guy , here -- maybe he does n't know what 's going on in his own administration .
But as soon as he gets back , he should fire , as appeasers , Gates ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : Secretary of defense ?
BIDEN : ... and Rice -- secretary of defense and secretary of
state .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Why ?
BIDEN : Because they both -- Gates as recently as a week ago -- said , we 've got to sit down and talk with the Iranian directly .

STEPHANOPOULOS :
How about the substance of what the president
was trying to say ?
Because John McCain picked up on it .
He said
basically , you know , we have a big difference here .
Barack Obama
wants unconditional talks with the Iranians .
We do n't .
Here 's what
Senator McCain said .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
MCCAIN : Talking , not even with soaring rhetoric , unconditional ,
and unconditional meetings with the man who calls Israel a stinking
corpse , and arms terrorist who kills Americans , will not convince Iran
to give up its nuclear program .
It is reckless .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Obama has said that his State
Department , his National Security Council would engage in
unconditional talks with the Iranians .
BIDEN : Let 's put this in perspective .
The reason why we'd be in
so much trouble if John McCain were president -- and I love him -- is
because of what you just heard .
What 's the alternative to talking with a country that 's building
a nuclear weapons , attempting to , that in fact is helping kill
Americans by supporting elements in Iraq that are killing Americans ?
You either talk ; you go to war ; or you maintain the status quo .
Now , let 's talk about talking .
President Bush , the White House ,
called me , several years ago , told me Air Force Two was waiting for me
at Andrews Air Force Base ; would I get on the plane and go meet with
Gadhafi , a real known terrorist , personally , a terrorist -- personally
responsible for killing kids at the school I went to , Syracuse
University , blowing up that Pan Am flight .
The president of the United States asked me to go .
He cut a deal
with Gadhafi , directly .
It was a smart thing to do .
He gave up his
nuclear weapons , Gadhafi .
What 's the second thing ?
We 're in Korea , right now , George .
You want to put the hit list
to the worst guys in the world ?
How about Kim Jong Il ?
They have proliferated nuclear technology , put us in jeopardy ,
and other nations around the world .
What is the president of the
United States doing , writing letters saying , " Dear Mr. Chairman " --
referring to him .
They 've cut a deal .
They 've cut a deal .
The president of the
United States of America , last time I was in Iraq , was trying to set
up , and recently asked for a third meeting with the Iranians , to talk
with them about what 's going on in Iraq .
This is sophistry .
This is ridiculous .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
It sounds like you 're calling it hypocrisy .
BIDEN : Well , I should -- I 'm trying to be more polite , but I
should n't be .
It was ridiculous .
This is president -- this is pure ,
unadulterated politics .
And the last point I 'll make -- maybe the president does n't know
-- I 'll be a smart guy , here -- maybe he does n't know what 's going on
in his own administration .
But as soon as he gets back , he should
fire , as appeasers , Gates ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : Secretary of defense ?

When I first wrote Cascading Style Sheets : The Definitive Guide , the part that caused me the most difficulty and headaches was the line layout material .
Several times I was sure I had it all figured out and accurately described , only to find out I was wrong .
For two weeks I corresponded with Ian Hickson and David Baron , arguing for my understanding of things and having them show me , in merciless detail , how I was wrong .
I doubt that I will ever stop owing them for their dedication to getting me through the wilderness of my own misunderstandings .
Later on , I produced a terse description of line layout which went through a protracted vetting process with the CSS Working Group and the members of www - style .
At the time it was published , there was no more detailed and accurate description of line layout available .
Even at that , corrections trickled in over the years , which made me think of it as my own tiny little The Art of Computer Programming .
Only without the small monetary reward for finding errors .
The point here is that line layout is very difficult to truly understand — even given everything I just said , I ’m still not convinced that I do — and that there are often surprises lurking for anyone who goes looking into the far corners of how it happens .
As I ’ve said before , my knowledge of what goes into the layout of lines of text imparts a sense of astonishment that any page can be successfully displayed in less than the projected age of the universe .
Why bring all this up ?
Because I went and poked line - height : normal with a stick , and found it to be both squamous and rugose .
As with all driven to such madness , I now seek , grinning wildly , to infect others .
Here ’s the punchline : the effects of declaring line - height : normal not only vary from browser to browser , which I had expected — in fact , quantifying those differences was the whole point — but they also vary from one font face to another , and can also vary within a given face .
I did not expect that .
At least , not consciously .
My work , let me show it to you : a JavaScript - driven test file where you can pick from a list of fonts and see what happens at a variety of sizes .
( Yes , the JS is completely obtrusive ; and yes , the JS is the square of amateur hour .
Let ’s move on , please .
I ’m perfectly happy to replace what ’s there with unobtrusive and sharper JS , as long as the basic point of the page , which is testing line - height : normal , is not compromised .
Again , moving on . )
When you first go to the test , you should ( I hope ) see a bunch of rulered boxes containing text using the very common font face Webdings , set at a bunch of different font sizes .
The table shows you how tall the simple line boxes are at each size , and therefore the numeric equivalent for line - height : normal at those sizes .
So if a line box is using font - size : 50px and the line box is 55 pixels tall , the numeric equivalent for line - height : normal is 1.1 ( 55 divided by 50 ) .
On my PowerBook , Webdings always yields a 1:1 ratio between the font - size and line box height .
The ten - pixel font size yields a ten - pixel - tall line box , and so on .
This is actually a little surprising by itself .
The CSS 2.1 specification says :
normal
Tells user agents to set the used value to a “ reasonable ” value based on the font of the element .
The value has the same meaning as < number > .
We recommend a used value for ‘ normal ’ between 1.0 to 1.2 .
The computed value is ‘ normal ’ .
This is basically what CSS has said since its first days ( see the equivalent text in CSS1 or in CSS2 for confirmation ) and there ’s always been a widespread assumption that , since 1.0 is probably too crowded , something around 1.2 is much more likely .
So finding a value of 1 was a surprise .
It was an even bigger surprise to me that this held true in Camino 1.5.2 , Firefox 2.0.0.14 , and Safari 2.0.4 , all on OS X. Firefox 3b5 did n’t render Webdings at all , so I do n’t know if it would do the same .
I actually suspect not , for reasons best left for another time ( and , possibly , a final release of Firefox 3 ) .
Various browsers doing the same thing in an under - specified area of the spec ?
That ca n’t be right .
It ’s pretty much an article of faith that given the chance to do anything differently , browsers will .
The sailing was so unexpectedly smooth that I immediately assumed was that a storm lurked just over the horizon .
Well , I was right .
All I had to do was start picking other font faces .
To start , I picked the next font on the list , Times New Roman , and the equivalent values for normal immediately changed .
In other words , the numeric equivalents for Times New Roman are different than those for Webdings .
The browsers were n’t maintaining a specific value for normal , but were altering it on a per-face basis .
Now , this is legal , given the way normal is under - specified .
There ’s room to allow for this behavior .
It ’s actually , once you think about it , a fairly good thing from a visual point of view : the best default line height for Times New Roman is probably not the best default line height for Courier New .
So while I was initially surprised , I got over it quickly .
The seemingly obvious conclusion was that browsers were actually respecting the fonts ’ built - in metrics .
This was reinforced when I found that the results were exactly the same from browser to browser .
Then I looked more closely at the numbers , and confusion set back in .
For Times New Roman , I was getting values of 1.1 , 1.12 , 1.16 , 1.15 , 1.149 , and 1.1499 .
If you were to round all of those numbers to two decimal points , you ’d get 1.10 , 1.12 , 1.16 , 1.15 , 1.15 , 1.15 .
If you round them all to one decimal place , you ’d get 1.1 , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.2 , 1.1 , 1.1 .
They ’re inconsistent .
But wait , I thought , I ’m trying to compare numbers I derived by dividing pixels by pixels .
Let ’s turn it around .
If I multiply the most precise measurement I ’ve gotten by the various font sizes , I get … carry the two …
11.499 , 28.7475 , 57.495 , 114.99 , 1149.9 , 11499 .
As compared to the actual values I got , which were 11 , 28 , 58 , 115 , 1149 , and 11499 .
Which means the results were inappropriately rounded up in some cases and down in others .
28.7475 became 28 and 1149.9 became 1149 , whereas 57.495 became 58 .
Even though 11.499 became 11 and 114.99 became 115 .
This was consistent across all the browsers I was testing .
So again , I was suspecting the fonts themselves .
And then I switched from Times New Roman to just plain old Times , and the storm was full upon me .
I ’ll give you the results in a table .
Derived normal equivalents for Times in OS X browsers font - size Camino 1.5.2 Firefox 2.0.0.14 Safari 2.0.4 10 1 1.2 1.3 25 1 1 1.16 50 1 1 1.18 100 1 1 1.15 1000 1 1 1.15 10000 1 1 1.15
Much the same happened when comparing Courier New with plain old Courier : full consistency on Courier New between browsers , albeit with the same strange ( non -) rounding effects as seen with Times New Roman ; but inconsistency between browsers on plain Courier — with Camino yielding a flat 1 down the line , Firefox going from 1.2 to 1 , and Safari having a range of values above the others ’ values .
Squamous !
Not to mention rugose !
Now it ’s time for the stunning conclusion that derives from all this information , which is : not here .
Sorry .
So far all I have are observations .
I may turn all this into a summary page which shows the results for all the font faces across multiple browsers and platforms , but first I ’ll need to get those numbers .
I do have a few speculations , though :
Firefox ’s inconsistency within font faces ( see Times and Courier , above ) may come from face substitution .
That ’s when a browser does n’t have a given character in a given face , so it looks for a substitute in another face .
If Firefox thinks it does n’t have 10 - pixel Times , it might substitute 10 - pixel something else serif-ish , and that face has different line height characteristics than Times .
I do n’t know what that other face might be , since it ’s not Times New Roman or Georgia , but this is one possibility .
It is not the minimum font size setting in the preferences , as I ’ve triple - checked to make sure I have that set to “ None ” .
Another possibility for Firefox ’s line height weirdness is a shift from subpixel font rendering to pixelly font rendering .
10 - pixel text in Firefox is distinctly pixelly compared to the other browsers I tested , while sizes above there are nice and smooth .
Why this would drive up the line height by two pixels ( 20 % ) , though , is not clear to me .
Much of what I ’ve observed will likely be laid to rest at the doorsteps of the font faces themselves .
I ’d like to know how it is that the rounding behaviors are so ( mathematically ) messed up within faces , though .
Perhaps ideal line heights are described as an equation rather than a simple ratio ?
Again , this was all done in OS X ; I ’ll be very interested to find out what happens on Windows , Linux , and other operating systems .
Side note for the Mac Opera fans warming up their flamethrowers : I ’ve left Opera 9.27 for OS X out of this because it seems to cap font sizes at a size well below 1000 , although this limit varied from one face to another .
Webdings and Courier capped at 507 pixels , whereas Courier capped at 574 pixels and Comic Sans MS stopped at 707 pixels .
I have no explanation , though doubtless someone will , but the upshot is that direct comparisons between Opera and the other browsers are impossible .
For sizes up to 100 pixels , the results were exactly consistent with Camino , if that means anything .
The one tentative conclusion I did reach is this : line - height : normal is a jumbled terrain of inconsistent behaviors , and it ’s best avoided in any sort of precision layout work .
I ’d already had that feeling , but at least now there ’s some evidence to back up the feeling .
In any case , I doubt this is the last I ’ll have to say on this particular topic .
Update 7 May 08 : I ’ve updated the test page with a fix from Ben Lowery so that it works in IE .
Thanks ,
Ben !
Now all I need is to add a way to type in any arbitrary font - family ’s name , and we ’ll have something everyone can use .
( Or else a way to use JavaScript to suck up the names of all the fonts installed on a machine and put them into the dropdown .
That would be cool , too . )
Entering its 21st season , MTV's The Real World returns to New York for a third time ... but for the first time it 's headed to an outer - borough .
That 's right , the seven generic , good - looking roommates will be heading to Brooklyn .
Shooting begins this summer , and will result in 12 hour - long episodes .
In the press release we received , Jon Murray , co-creator of the show , says " The Brooklyn season , like the Hollywood season , will focus on what people loved about ' The Real World ' when it launched in 1992 - genuine people , meaningful conflict and powerful stories . "
Really Jon ?
We 're sort of betting it 'll be more about the cast taking over bars , fighting with locals , getting drunk and sleeping with roommates -- all as they take their amazingly overpriced living quarters for granted .
The big question now is :
Which part of Brooklyn will have the distinct pleasure of welcoming the new residents ?
Our guess is they 'll be taking over a few luxury condo units in Williamsburg .
Perhaps this will unite the hipsters and anti-hipsters of the 'nabe ?
Either way , get ready to see the production taking over McCarren Pool Parties this summer .

MNSaveRecipe ( ) ;
Many employees often do not file grievances even when presented with the opportunity to do so .
A new study in Industrial Relations sought to assess the degree to which certain minority groups may be more or less prone to file grievances as a way to remedy particular types of workplace issues or problems .
Self - report data were collected from a sample of 866 blue - collar workers drawn from four unions in the northeastern United States .
The study assessed employee grievance filing in relationship to demographic variables , including gender and race .
The sample consisted of men , women , whites , African Americans , and Hispanics .
The overall rate of actual grievance filing by women and ethnic minorities was not significantly different from that of their male or white counterparts .
However , employee demographic characteristics do serve as a significant moderator of the link between the severity of potentially injurious workplace conditions and the rate of employee grievance filing .
Specifically , the grievance filing of women and minorities was more sensitive to the severity of particular workplace conditions than was the grievance filing of their majority peers .
In contrast , the grievance - filing behavior of men and whites tended to remain fairly constant regardless of their perceived level of workplace injustice or injury .
It is reasonable to expect then that grievance filing for women and minorities will be utilized only when the severity of the condition is such that the failure to file is perceived as entailing even greater risks than those entailed in filing .
“ Our findings suggest that for those individuals who , because of their gender or minority status , are disadvantaged in the labor market and are thus perhaps most in need of an effective mechanism by which to voice concerns regarding the workplace , the grievance system may not necessarily always provide an adequate answer , ” the authors note .

What keeps women from reporting sexual harassment ?
House Dems , Ron Paul targeted over surveillance votes Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday April 22 , 2008
|
Print This Email This New radio ads are running in districts of several Democratic members of Congress , as well as Texas Republican Rep. Ron Paul , targeting the lawmakers for their opposition to a White House - backed surveillance bill .
The ads play on national security fears in an attempt to spur these lawmakers to give in to the administration 's demands .
Critics of the administration - backed bill say it does not guarantee enough civil liberties protections and would eliminate oversight of President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program .
Meanwhile , Politico reports that Democrats , Republicans and administration officials have met to discuss the stalled bill in question .
It 's the first time since February parties on all sides of the issue have met .
The ads come from the ostensibly nonpartisan group Defense of Democracies , following up on an earlier campaign from the group targeting many of the same lawmakers .
The organization is urging the House to pass a Bush - approved update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act that would provide legal immunity to phone companies that may have violated the law in facilitating the warrantless wiretapping of Americans after 9/11 .
Civil libertarians and privacy advocates say the White House version of the bill , which already has been approved in the Senate , also does not provide enough judicial and congressional oversight for the administration 's proposed surveillance program .
Defense of Democracies is running ads in a dozen districts across the country , targeting 11 Democrats and Paul who voted for an alternative FISA bill that passed the House last month .
" This refusal to oppose the bogus House bill ensures that vital intelligence is being lost and that Americas intelligence community does not have the tools needed to detect and prevent terrorist attacks , " the group 's president Clifford May , said in a news release posted to its
Web site .
The group claims to be bipartisan , but its earlier effort caused several Democrats to jump ship , and May told the Washington Post he has discussed conservatives ' lagging fundraising efforts with former Bush strategist Karl Rove .
Defense of Democracies ' campaign targets mostly " Blue Dog " Democrats who initially indicated they would support the White House - approved FISA bill .
It accuses them of not heeding the " courage of their convictions " and bowing to pressure from Democratic leadership .
Writing at Bluestem Prarie , which covers one of the lawmakers targeted by the campaign , Rep. Tim Walz ( D - MN ) , Ollie Ox writes that those who changed their mind about the FISA bill did so " after they actually saw the legislation brought before them . "
Walz , however , is not a " Blue Dog " Democrat , and according to Roll Call , turned down the group 's invitation to join .
The Defense of Democracies ad also claims that vital intelligence was lost because of the delay in passing a new law , citing claims from administration officials .
The Los Angeles Times reported the administration backtracked form this claim soon after it was made .
WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - Children in a New Zealand school have been banned from bringing cakes to share on their birthdays , due to new government healthy eating guidelines .
Pupils at Oteha Valley primary school north of Auckland have been told they are allowed to celebrate their birthdays , but the cake must stay at home , the New Zealand Herald newspaper reported .
The Ministry of Education has been on a fat - busting crusade , introducing sweeping guidelines against unhealthy food in New Zealand schools .
Oteha Valley has a large number of pupils born in September and October , and there can be up to four cakes a week in some classes , principal Megan Bowden told the Herald .
It had gotten to the point where parents thought they were required to provide a cake for their child ’s birthday .
The school has advised parents in a newsletter to stop sending cakes to school from the next term .
A Ministry of Education spokesman told the Herald the government guidelines only applied to food sold on the premises , and schools did not need to monitor food brought in from outside .
Why is Secular European Society Doing so Much Better Than God-Fearing America ?
Let ’s Start With Sex
In my last essay I outlined how sociological research is revealing that the prosperous democracies with high levels of religiosity -- especially the conservative , creationist USA -- tend to have high levels of social dysfunction , especially in terms of murder , incarceration , juvenile and adult mortality , divorce , sexually transmitted diseases , abortion , and teen pregnancy .
It is one thing to know that the relentless effort by the religious community to convince their flocks that failure to adhere to traditional religious values leads to societal chaos and depravity is abjectly false .
It is also important to understand why secular nations are doing better than the more religious ones , with some achieving levels of societal health never before seen in history .
In the last few years sociological analysis has come up with the basic answers , and one way or another they are not going to make a lot of people happy .
The good news for those of liberal bent is that the strongly secular democracies – that would pretty much be all the advanced western nations other than ours – have adopted a broad set of progressive social and economic policies that , for all their imperfections , have been remarkably effective .
So let ’s start with one of them .
Sex .
In the rest of the west the old Christian notion that sex is a moral issue that should be practiced or not according to the supposed scriptural dictates of a creator was largely abandoned in the post WW II era .
Instead , late teen sex is now seen as a normal part of maturing .
In a Brit drama series I once caught on PBS , a 16 year old lost his virginity at his girlfriend ’s home with her family down stairs knowing what was going on and being fine with it , as it was the boy ’s mother .
Partial nudity on the beaches and in parks , and in advertising , is more widely accepted across the pond .
And what is the result of all this acceptance of sex outside of holy matrimony ?
Not much .
Literally , a large scale comparison of sexual behavior in the French and in Americans found little difference in terms of sex in and outside marriage , with the proviso that in some ways the French are a little more conservative .
Teens start having sex at about the same average age across the western nations .
But in ways that count they are doing much better ?
How ?
Simple .
Condoms , condoms , condoms .
Because sex is seen as a pragmatic health care concern rather than an ideological moral issue in other western countries , they hit the kids with explicit sex - ed early in grade school .
The theory is give youngsters a heads up on the facts of sex before they even want to hear about them and then they will be better prepared with some practical knowledge when the hormones kick in .
Abstinence is not emphasized .
Condoms are .
Americans who travel to Europe can be off put by all the prophylactic ads .
The goal is not to eliminate all risk – that will never happen -- it is to manage risk in a realistic manner that brings down adverse consequences to a practical minimum .
One result is that gonorrhea and syphilis are nearly extinct in Scandinavia .
When the sexual revolution got underway nearly half a century ago its advocates were often as naïve as they were optimistic , the venereal disease epidemic of the 60s and 70s followed by HIV was one consequence they did not see coming .
There are good reasons to criticize the excesses of the sexual revolution , but in their extremist counter movement religiously motivated traditionalists have managed to be even more nonsensical in their version of sexual idealism .
The Ring Thing and True Love movements have inspired a couple of million teens to pledge abstinence until they wed .
Then there are the Purity Balls where fathers vow to guard their daughter ’s virginity until the special day he gives her away to the one and only man she will ever have intercourse with .
At least those are private affairs .
The evangelical churches succeeded in getting the then Republican Congress to help finance abstinence only sex-ed in public schools to the tune of nearly 90 million dollars a year in combined federal and state funds .
( Ever notice how the right is against big , inefficient government programs – unless it ’s for something they like ? )
Found in a third of the school systems , abstinence sex-ed is not actual education ; the rules dictate that the lessons must go to lengths to deliberately not tell children about a whole lot of the facts of sex through a combination of calculated omission and frequent distortion .
Real teaching , of course , tries to cram the growing brains of the tykes with as much information as they can hold .
The biggest deception is the line that abstinence is a sure way to lower the risk of STDs or pregnancy to zero .
The problem is that abstinence actually has a very high failure rate .
It ’s called having sex .
Surveys find that a third of Americans disapprove of premarital sex , but that all but 5 % do it , so even the great majority of those who think nonmarital sex is a bad idea ca n’t keep themselves from participating .
It should be no surprise that all but a small fraction of those who pledge abstinence break the vow before marriage .
The drive to have sex is simply overwhelming .
Back in the olden days they knew how to handle this basic fact of human biology .
Folks got married about the same time , or just a few years after , puberty began , while in their teens .
These days you are talking a decade or much more between wanting to have sex really bad and getting official sanction for it .
Such a situation has never before been faced in history , and the notion that the majority , or even a large minority , is somehow going to resist having sex during that yawning gap is inane .
Nearly all westerners including most Americans can figure that one out .
The only folks sufficiently detached from reality to actually advocate such a hopelessly impractical policy as abstinence - only these days are the 15 % of the population ( according to an NPR / Kaiser / Kennedy poll ) whose conservative thinking is driven by supernaturalistic beliefs .
The result of doing what the religious right thinks best is the fine mess our nation finds itself in .
Which brings us to an interesting item .
Back when the Repub Congress launched the abstinence only program they commissioned a study to verify its efficacy .
I noticed that the report did not come out on schedule , and failed to appear in subsequent years .
Meanwhile study after study -- some by private organizations , some by states wondering just how well the program they were supplying a third of the funds for was working out in their schools -- came to the same conclusion .
Abstinence - only does not work .
Lacking basic information on sex , and taught that condoms are highly unreliable , the maleducated abstinence - only students all too often find themselves performing various sexual acts – research indicates they are especially prone towards oral activities – when the hormones start flowing , but they lack the practical knowledge or equipment to keep their level of risk to a reasonable minimum .
Even if abstinence - only grads have less sex , they are at markedly higher risk of something bad happening when they almost inevitably do become sexually active .
The traditionalists ’ desperate dream of achieving “ purity ” is backfiring in a classic example of unintended consequences .
One result is that STD infection rates are up to hundreds of times higher in America than in some nonreligious democracies ( nor is the problem limited to our nation ’s poor minorities , gonorrhea is common among middle class whites ) .
Finally , the big congressional study came out last year .
Not that there was a high profile announcement from the White House touting the success of the faith - based sex -ed program .
Instead it was released into the news dead zone that is Friday afternoon .
The study agreed with the others that abstinence - only is a bust .
That ’s 90 million taxpayer ’s dollars a year down the drain .
Because of the well documented failings of the just - say - no approach to sex ed , a growing number of states are balking at accepting the program ’s federal funds , preferring to offer their students an real education on the subject .
There is , of course , no perfect system .
Condoms do fail on occasion , people do n’t like them , folks do foolish things .
And the situation here in America is not all bad .
Rates of STD infections , abortions and youth pregnancy have been going down over the last two or three decades – during the same period that the number of nonreligious has been soaring .
Even so , the fact that cannot be gotten around is that the tell - the - kids - the - facts strategy employed in the other advanced nations is producing better overall results than the faith - based techniques that still hold sway in much of America .
The problem for the right is that they cannot admit they are wrong .
Not only would it require dropping a core tenet of Bible based morality , it would mean abandoning their long term campaign to return the nation to the set of social mores it operated under back in the 1950s – although studies show that nine out of ten people were having sex outside marriage even back then .
In other words , they will have lost the Culture War .
Actually , they already have lost the Culture War , but that is a another ball of wax .
The ideology driven struggle of the social and religious right to oppose progressive and enlightened attitudes towards human sexuality is an outstanding example of how traditionalism based on dubious reading of ancient tribal scripture is clearly doing damage to the societal health of the nation .
But as the next essays will show , the problem is whole lot bigger , and more complex , than that .
By the way , the idea that the Bible bans sex outside of marriage is something of a stretch , because there is no passage that outright says it is a no - no .
The idea that the scriptural creator thinks it is a big sin has to be inferred .
That is why Jews tend to be less uptight about sexual matters than Christians , and the latter ’s obsession on the subject stems from the writings of latter Biblical figures such a Paul , Jesus says little on the matter .
Even harder to justify on a Biblical basis is a ban on abortion .
There simply is no verse that says it is forbidden .
That glaring truth has caused a small minority of fundamentalists who really try to take the Bible literally to cite the passages that suggest human life begins with the first breath after birth .
The right ’s current and cynical obsession over abortion stems from the arbitrary invention that God is pro-life , even though , as Mark Twain pointed out in Letters From the Earth , the Biblical God repeatedly orders his followers to outright murder children .
Although Jesus says little about sex in the gospels , there is one thing he was very explicit about .
He thought that ensuring celibacy by becoming a eunuch is a fine idea .
Good ahead and check it out , it ’s right there in Matthew 19:12 -- I do n’t make these things up .
Is n’t it curious how the right wingers who proclaim they are people of unwavering principle who base their moral code on the testaments go on and on about the Bible and Jesus say this and say that about sex even when they really do n’t , and when it comes to an explicit New Testament statement for how to keep sexually pure by self castration they do n’t breath a word ?

The road from Harar runs for more than 600 miles east towards the border with Somalia , penetrating deep into the desiccated badlands of the Ogaden desert , the dusty heart of Ethiopia 's war - torn Somali regional state .
Sparse scrub and thorn bush , brown termite mounds , and flocks of bony sheep edge up against the burning asphalt strip .
Wandering camels are a hazard to traffic ; but vehicles are few .
Like the occasional herdsman , standing outside transportable mudul huts , they stare in mild surprise as white UN Land Cruisers race by .
The road 's destination is Gode , via the regional capital of Jijiga , and the towns of Kebri Beyah , Degehabur and Kebri Dehar .
But the part - finished two - lane road also blazes a figurative path , unwelcome to some , into the isolated and disputed fiefdoms of one of the world 's most opaque , dangerous and misunderstood Muslim insurgencies .
This is the land that the self - styled separatists of the Ogaden National Liberation Front claim as their own .
Exactly what the ethnic Somalis of the ONLF want - autonomy , independence , or the historic dream of a " greater Somalia " - is far from clear .
What is certain is the federal government in Addis Ababa , dominated by Orthodox Christian Tigrayans and Amharans , is determined the Sunni insurgents ' aims will not be achieved by violence .
Deep in these desert wastes lie the Somali state zones ( provinces ) of Degehabur , Fik and Qorahay .
It is here , largely unseen and unreported , that the Ethiopian army , backed by rival sub-clans , has waged a violent nine - month - long campaign against factions of the Ogadeni clan , the backbone of the ONLF .
And it is here , in this wilderness of endless , shimmering horizons , vast untapped resources and suspected oil reserves that the UN says up to 4.5 million could soon face famine - like conditions , partly as a result of the conflict .
" There are strong reasons to believe such a catastrophe could occur in the next few months if all the necessary action to avert it is not taken , " John Holmes , the UN undersecretary for humanitarian affairs , warned in December .
Federal and state officials dismiss such claims as wildly exaggerated , saying six of Somali state 's nine zones , where the majority of the region 's population lives , are peaceful .
While conceding there may have been " a few problems " involving individual soldiers , ministers insist ONLF claims of ongoing atrocities committed by Ethiopian troops - claims supported by Human Rights Watch - lack foundation .
" The situation is very calm now .
We have destroyed [ the ONLF ] , " said Abdullahi Hassan , the Somali state president .
Pointing to continuing strife in next - door Somalia , where Ethiopian and African Union troops support the western - backed Transitional Federal Government against hardline Islamists and warlords , he said the trouble was not homegrown .
" If there is a problem with your neighbour , the problem will touch you .
For years Somalia has been harbouring international terrorists linked to al - Qaida and anti-peace elements , " Abdullahi said .
And much of the unrest was being orchestrated by Eritrea , Ethiopia 's long - time enemy , he claimed .
Abdi Mohmmad Omer , Somali state security chief , said : " The war is no longer between the ONLF and the government , it is clan against clan , against some of the Ogadeni who are connected to al - Qaida . "
Abdi also said the region had been " pacified " .
But he said about 200 civilians had been killed in clan fighting with the ONLF in the past two months .
While declining to estimate how many had died since the conflict escalated last summer , he dismissed as absurd ONLF claims that a genocide was taking place .
Sulub Abdullahi Mohammad , an elder of the Jedwaq tribe , said his people , like the Wayteen and Balaad sub-clans , regularly confronted the ONLF militants who , he said , still posed a serious threat .
He pointed to a recent bombing and shooting in Jijiga in which a traffic policeman and a bystander were killed .
" The number of deaths is uncountable .
The fighting has gone up and down in the past six months .
But it is not over . "
Trying to get people to describe what is happening is difficult .
Much of the population comprises semi-nomadic pastoralists who tend to eschew foreign media .
Down the Harar road , in the crowded , unpaved streets of Degehabur , a market town of 60,000 , residents seem caught between concern over how the authorities might react and fear of insurgents .
Few talk openly .
One woman , speaking tearfully inside her house , tells a female reporter she was raped by a soldier .
But she insists her name not be publicised .
She can provide no " evidence " .
She has , she says , much shame - and no hope of justice .
Nur Arab , Degehabur 's administrator , does not pretend problems do not exist .
He says there has been " a big change for the better " since the UN and NGOs returned in strength recently , having been largely excluded during the army crackdown .
Most of the town 's residents have received food aid , he said .
" The ONLF has no base here .
They are not organised .
But sometimes they come into the streets and they disturb the people , " Nur said .
" They are in groups of 15 or 20 maximum .
They are often very young .
They demand money and help from the people .
If somebody does not give , they will kill them .
They appear , then they disappear . "
Following earlier warnings , the UN says relief work is proceeding relatively unimpeded .
Nineteen NGOs have returned to the area .
Others may follow .
An extra $ 600,000 ( £ 300,000 ) has been allocated to the World Food Programme to help Ethiopia deliver supplies .
But " the humanitarian situation within the military operational area continues to be of concern , " the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said .
It suggested a bigger , natural problem was that the rains had failed in several zones and crop output was declining .
The UN launched a $ 4 m drought appeal this month .
Even if the situation has eased , there is no end in sight to the conflict .
The ONLF has again accused Addis Ababa of killing and starving thousands .
It claimed the UN had been duped into collaborating .
The government was using aid as a political tool .
" Ethiopia is doing all [ this ] to suppress the people 's resistance against tyranny and violation of their human rights . "
The insurgency might intensify , it warned .
As if they did not know it , for the troubled clans of the Somali regional state a long hard road awaits .
In the Ogaden , it has always been thus .
Slow Down German State Introduces Autobahn Speed Limit
For years , Germans have worried that speed limits may be coming for the autobahn .

And then we can move on to the real threat by invading the sun .
1 . With the possible exception of Giblets , in his February 23 , 2003 Washington Post op - ed , " This War Is Going To Be Perfect . "
2 . Because when you blow stuff up and kill people it 's important that you blow stuff up and kill people in a way that maintains international respect and legitimacy for future blow - stuff - uppery and people - killing .
3. Giblets is on to you , ANSWER !
Oh sure , you say you 're just opposed to pointless and criminal wars , but Giblets knows it 's all part of your sinister socialist scheme to free Mumia !

0:36 Intro. EconTalk survey thanks .
Money , monetary policy , supply of money .
What is the money supply and why do we keep track of it ?
Money used as medium of exchange .
Different measures .
Quantity is a rough indicator of extent of inflation , which has costs but in some special circumstances , benefits .
Job of Federal Reserve ( Fed ) is to judiciously manage those costs and benefits .
Inflation .
If we just left the nominal quantity of money the same , what would happen ?
We could fix the monetary base , which is supply of currency plus bank reserves held at the Fed .
Some broader measures of the money supply probably would grow through supply of credit .
Nevertheless , since more goods and services would be produced , there would be deflation -- price level would fall .
Advantage : we would see in a transparent way the growth of the economy .
But economists have argued that that 's a bad idea .
Friedman argued for stable prices ,
Fed increases money supply at roughly the same rate as growth in the economy .
Human irrationality : Employees do n't like hearing that their wages will be cut by 3 % this year but that the price level will also fall by that much or even more .
These are our current expectations , which wo n't go away soon .
Do n't want to have the wages of a large number of people have to fall .
Larry Summers .
With small amount of inflation , wage rises even though price level rises by more , so tricks people into being satisfied with their wages .
Historical issue of variability .
Want to try to distinguish between nominal and real changes .
If inflation is unpredictable and uncertain you can't distinguish if your product 's price is higher because of increase in demand or because of inflation .
So economists have tended to argue in favor of low but stable inflation .
Business investment decisions tend to be made for large rates of return relative to small rates of inflation .
9:16 Fed , Central Bank .
Standard macroeconomic argument for how a change in Fed policy will ripple its way to higher prices .
Simple version :
More money in the system , people spend or lend more , greater flow of purchasing power , and over time prices rise .
Pretty clearly is true .
More complicated version : What Fed is really doing is buying up Treasury Bills with cash .
From the point of view of a bank , why is a cash holding different from a Treasury Bill holding ?
Different for tips in coffee shop , but not for financial institution .
But they have different effects on the economy .
Why ?
Friedman used to use idea of a helicopter drop , mental experiment .
Experiment Number 1 : Fed adds money to the system -- say , it doubles the money supply -- and people find they have more green pieces of paper , higher liquidity than they want , so they try to spend it .
But no more stuff available than before , so price level doubles as people bid for the goods .
Other version , experiment Number 2 : the stores that find people trying to spend money find themselves with more money , and then think their goods are more popular ; hire more people , produce more .
In this version , real effects ; but they are temporary .
Eventually people catch on , businesses fire the extra people .
If everyone knows the government is doubling the money or just adding zeros to bills , they are not fooled and there are no real effects .
Monetary surprise can only work now and then .
If there is unemployment and no one expects monetary increase , then the economy can be " stimulated " but it 's temporary .
( Or with strong minimum wages as in some of Europe . )
If you try to play this game too often , you end up with lots of inflation and no increase in employment .
This is what is going on now in U.S. Stagflation , thought to be impossible ; Phillips Curve , idea that in the short run you can increase inflation and decrease unemployment .
Does n't mean you should inflate , but the grab bag option is there .
It 's not a universally exploitable idea .
In 1970s , it did n't work -- high inflation and high unemployment ; money supply could not be used to manipulate the employment rate .
With a real shock , monetary policy typically does n't do very well .
In the 1970s , the Fed first tried to deflate ; then tried to inflate .
17:47 Today we have another kind of real shock , collapse of real estate bubble .
A good rule of thumb is that with a real shock , there is nothing the Fed can do .
But is the real estate bubble a real shock or is it a nominal shock ?
Is n't the housing situation just a nominal change to an asset price ?
Shock to credit .
Risky assets were thought to not be risky , but they 've decided they were risky .
Readjustment of asset portfolios is real , not nominal .
But will there really be a shrinking of credit because of the lack of transparency ?
Sectoral reallocation away from risky assets .
Global savings not down , just not funding risk .
Bumpy path .
Why trading in so many assets has dried up is the fundamental price .
You'd think there still would be some price at which even junk bonds would trade .
Price signals have been removed from the market and people do n't know what to do .
Agency problem .
Pulls information out of market prices .
Have markets , but do n't have as much information injected into the markets .
22:28 Fed .
Open market operations , buying and selling of Treasuries .
All the focus today is on the rate that the Fed charges member banks .
By changing the interest rate , they are either encouraging ( by lowering the rate ) or discouraging ( by raising it ) member banks to borrow .
Banks use the Fed as a lender of last resort .
Is the Fed trying to affect bank costs or interest rates ?
Discount rate vs. Federal Funds rate .
Fed admits discount rate - - rate to lend to a bank in distress -- is not effective .
Term auction facility set up to bypass discount window .
Federal Funds rate is what newspapers are talking about .
It does that by buying more T - bills , which creates more liquid money , more available loanable funds , which pushes down the ( short term ) Federal Funds rate .
Fed can't lower long term rate ( or maybe by only a tiny amount ) , though it can through inflation raise them .
Irving Fisher broke interest rates into real and nominal parts : productivity of the loan in real terms , what would grow ; and the nominal part , the part that 's due to inflation .
If everyone expects inflation to be 10 % per year , I 'll never loan money at less than 10 % .
Inflation premium is built into interest rates .
Leads to a paradox : Normally we think of supply and demand of money as lowering interest rates when we expand the supply of money .
The interest rate is something like the price of money .
But if the Fed puts money into the system , it will actually raise the nominal interest rate via inflation .
Inevitable tension .
If the Fed only does it once they can lower the real rate without the higher nominal rate ; but if you keep on doing it you end up with high nominal rate .
With a high nominal rate you also end up with greater uncertainty , greater variability .
Some people have a low and others a high real rate .
31:18 When we read that the Fed has raised interest rates ( the Federal Funds rate ) , what has actually happened is that the Fed has intervened in the market for Treasuries .
Often talked about through a different mechanism .
The press often says things like " The economy is growing too quickly .
The Fed is raising rates to try to slow the economy down .
If interest rates are higher , people will invest less , take fewer risks .
Now , they are worried the economy is slowing down , so they are stimulating the economy by lowering interest rates , trying to influence investment decisions . "
But that is not what the Fed is trying to do , is it ?
Complicated .
Hard to show that higher or lower real interest rates actually have any effect on investment .
If you are aiming for a 30 % return on investment ( likely will result in smaller rate of return after including failures ) , small changes in interest rates may have little effect on you .
How credit markets perceive risk , framing of credit risk , psychological contagion effect ; may be where a lot of where the Fed 's influence comes from .
Stock market often reacts strongly to the Fed .
Information gained from what the Fed does .
Behavioral economics : lending , risk perception , banks .
36:26 Alternatives to the Fed .
Some people think the Fed is harmful to the economy .
Macroeconomic variability in the United States has become much smaller than 50 or 100 years ago , maybe because of Fed 's performance ( even though it 's made many mistakes ) .
What about private money or the gold standard ?
Throughout most of world history central banks have mostly been a disaster but in the last years worldwide they have done a good job .
Mexican central bank example .
Financial markets may have the ability to monitor central banks better than previously .
Politicians showed that policies against inflation are popular , Reagan , Thatcher , Volker .
Should we have free banking ?
Imagine that we had American Express Travelers ' Checks as money , competing with Thomas Cook's Travelers ' Checks .
Risk .
But what would advantage be ?
Right now we have something that looks like private money -- credit cards .
How would private money work in today 's world ?
Is it legal ?
My bank check right now is a form of private money .
Works because we have deposit insurance , so even if the bank had a problem my check would still be good .
Private company could issue the money ; what makes the difference is what kind of guarantee is behind it all .
Colorful money , athlete faces , attractive women , trading cards .
Why do n't we have such money now ?
Originally governments wanted to earn seignorage , printing money and buying up services getting something for nothing , like a counterfeiter .
Seignorage is no longer an important source of revenue in most countries .
Government is loathe to give up something it has a claim on doing .
Two functions of money : unit of account , and medium of exchange .
Private monies are not legal tender -- we can't force others to accept them .
Currency swaps in foreign currencies .
Economies of scale to liquidity .
44:15 Because the currency value is not kept up with a regimented amount of gold , some argue that the whole thing is a house of cards .
No backing .
If you feel they are a sham , I 'd be happy to accept them and sell you some services in return .
Gold standard argument : some psychological .
Some believe price level will be more stable and there would be fewer business cycles because the supply of gold is pretty stable .
Slower to mine it than to print paper money .
But look at the price of gold - - it 's very volatile .
On a gold standard , the price level would thus be volatile .
Would work best if all countries were on it .
Is price of gold erratic mostly because it 's speculative ?
Gold is a hedge against bad times and also against bad fiat ( paper ) money performance .
Why take the chance ?
Why is gold a hedge against risk ?
True empirically .
Russian ruble example , wallpaper .
Why would you turn to gold ?
It 's just a piece of metal .
It 's become a norm , but it 's kind of no more reliable than fiat money .
No necessary reason for that .
Psychology .
Historically , small amounts were quite valuable , you could hide or store it and it would be worth a lot .
May not apply in today 's world .
Diamonds : little , associated with promises kept .
On gold standard , more swings in a downward direction ; greater chance of negative monetary shock with a gold standard .
Great Depression and monetary shock .
Could argue that gold standard could possibly do as well as we do now .
Transition question : what is the right price of gold ?
If we make a transition at the wrong rate there would be a sudden inflation or deflation , and we 'd give up on it .
54:34 Independence of the Fed .
Political economy :
Is it plausible to think that the stabilities will persist in the next 25 years ?
New Zealand has Central Bank that is required to have inflation per the legislature , stable .
Friedman podcast , attributed improvement in N.Z. performance to Donald Brash .
Brash took over in 1989 ; by 1992
Act in full swing .
Fed independence is something of a misnomer .
They track public opinion .
Supreme Court : political forces do matter and behavior appears to be responsive .
Friedman 's prescriptive rule for monetary growth idea has been abandoned ( originally 3 % per year handled by a computer ) , early 1980s .
One problem : which money supply ?
But also , perception that if you freeze rate of growth of money supply , could have short term interest rate or exchange rate volatility would be unacceptable .
Swiss example , ended up in price growth rules instead of monetary growth rules .
Big learning process , 1980s .
Focus on the outcome rather than on the tool .
Maybe because the Fed can't really control " the " money supply .
Independence : Fed 's mandate is not only to control inflation , but also to achieve a stable " economy . "
But they do not have enough instruments to do this .

We Demand Partners submit
Petitions to City of Cincinnati
to place Trolley measure on Ballot .
CLICK HERE FOR
WEDEMANDABETTERPLAN.COM
On August 3 , 2009 we formally issued our demand for a vote on passenger rail transportation to Cincinnati City Council .
Hundreds of petition forms containing 11,530 signatures were officially transmitted to the Clerk of Council , who will have them verified according to the statutory procedure , eventually causing the anti-boondoggle charter amendment to be placed on the November 3rd ballot .
The entire WeDemandAVote.com coalition , comprised of the Cincinnati Chapter of the NAACP , COAST , Southwestern Ohio Green Party , and Cincinnati Libertarian Party , would like to thank the many volunteers who circulated the petition .
We would especially like to thank the thousands of citizens who participated in the democratic process by either signing our petition , or by listening with open minds to the merits of our case .
Widespread common sense and vigorous debate leave us more convinced than ever that voters should decide passenger rail transportation matters , not politicians .
A few notes from the field :
We expected to find more support in far - flung neighborhoods than along the planned route .
Neighborhood anger at the ridiculous trolley plan was as expected , but we were pleasantly surprised at how productive signature gathering efforts were at Findlay Market and Fountain Square .
City leaders noticed too , and forced us to sue them in Federal Court to halt their harassment .
1st amendment wins again .
Some of COAST 's LGBT members had been telling us how prevalent fiscal conservatism is among their community , so we made a concerted effort to saturate the Pride Parade and Northside 4th of July Parade .
We certainly were n't disappointed .
These two events out - produced many church festivals .
We had no luck recruiting LGBT leaders to " come out " in support of our cause , but community members were some of the most knowledgeable and budget - savvy voters we encountered .
Thanks , let 's find more ways to work together .
Special thanks goes out to Councilmember Roxanne Qualls .
Her insistence that uptown be included on the route introduced tremendous uncertainty into the proposal .
City planners scrambled to figure out how , and indeed if they could get up the hill , and struggled with a near - doubling of the cost .
All of that gave us the time we needed to conduct a rather relaxed signature drive .
If not for that , the streetcar might be underway by now .
The biggest boon to petition production , however , was Mayor Mallory .
His mishandling of the budget , frequent junkets , and utter obliviousness to the plight of the beleaguered taxpayer engendered a rage among the electorate that had people yanking petitions out of our hands to sign them .
Today the campaign also enters the second phase .
Now we have an opponent .
Cincinnatians for Progress will try to convince voters to trust city leaders to do their thinking for them .
They 'll ridicule the act of voting .
And in their heart of hearts , they 'll be thinking , " These rubes are n't smart enough to decide whether this is a good plan . "
The CFP message reflects the attitude of the current administration .
To them , " progress " is condescending contempt for voters .

This November , voters will say , " right back at you . "

Trolley Folly
____________________________________________
WHY THE TROLLEY SHOULD BE OPPOSED
· This project is opposed by the Cincinnati Chapter of the NAACP , the Green Party , the Libertarian Party , Hamilton County Business Owners , and the Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes .
These groups form the WeDemandAVote.com coalition and are gathering signatures on an initiative petition to require voter approval prior to spending taxpayer dollars on rolling stock or right - of - way acquisition .
However city officials continue to force this project down citizens ' throats despite widespread public opposition .
· 100 % of the area proposed for streetcar coverage is presently served by taxpayer subsidized municipal buses .
In fact , most of the proposed streetcar route directly overlaps existing bus routes , further congesting downtown streets .
No plans for integration between bus and streetcar systems have been proposed .
·
The route conspicuously avoids vast sections of the urban core , providing poor transportation coverage .
Proponents tout the economic development potential of streetcars in other cities , but have confined the proposed route solely to portions of the urban core that are already fully developed .
This plan is not " shovel - ready " because the route needs to be reworked in order to provide full transportation coverage , and full economic development coverage before it can be viable .
· Costs for the project ( capital and operating ) will be shouldered by all 330,000 + city residents .
But the project will only serve perhaps 20,000 citizens in the urban core .
Excitement among the few beneficiaries of the system is , of course , very high .
However loathing for this latest political boondoggle is even greater among the much larger number of taxpayers who receive no benefit from it at all .
·
Tax increment financing is well established in the project area , but provides minimal funding , due to poor route selection explained above .
This is the primary source of the vast disparity between payers and beneficiaries .
Proper route selection would allow most project costs to be paid for out of real property appreciation in the area served , the residents of which are also the primary beneficiaries .
The current proposal cannibalizes existing infrastructure budgets in non-served areas .
·
It 's estimated that 40 permanent jobs will be created as part of the streetcar program .
They include 15 drivers for the seven planned cars , 10 maintenance workers , 5 managers , and 10 office and clerical staff .
That 's about $ 4.5 million per job for a $ 183 million capital project .
·
This project requires another year of public hearings and reengineering before it will be a viable infrastructure project , therefore it is not " shovel - ready . "
This project is confined to a tiny portion of the Cincinnati metropolitan area which is already fully developed , so the stimulus effect will be negligible .
Long term jobs created by this project are far too costly to justify .
Therefore , this project is not suitable for inclusion in the pending stimulus bill .

Photo Enforcement Defeated at the Ballot Box in Texas & Ohio Voters in College Station , Texas as well as Chillicothe and Heath , Ohio vote to ban automated ticketing machines .
Posted : 04 Nov 2009 12:01 AM
PST
Voters in three cities sent a clear message to local lawmakers yesterday by adopting charter amendments that ban photo enforcement .
In addition to kicking two camera supporters from the city council , 72 percent of those voting in Chillicothe , Ohio approved a total prohibition on the use of red light cameras and speed cameras .
In College Station , Texas the vote was much closer , but at the end of the night 52 percent wanted the red light cameras to come down .
In Heath , Ohio 51 percent voted against the cameras .
A total of nine cities nationwide have used the initiative process to ban camera enforcement since 1991 , with camera proponents never having won a public vote .
The triple defeat for the photo enforcement industry came despite a well - funded public relations effort in each of the cities .
In Chillicothe , Redflex Traffic Systems sent a glossy mailer to every voter while the mayor demanded that the Ohio Supreme Court ban the public from even voting on the issue -- a move high court justices swiftly rejected .
Citizens Against Photo Enforcement ( CAPE ) , the group responsible for the ballot measure , claimed an additional victory as voters elected camera opponent Bruce Arnold , who won the seat of council president , Jeremy Siberell , who won the fifth ward and Dustin Proehl , the only incumbent to have voted against cameras .
CAPE leader Rebecca Valentich told TheNewspaper that she was thrilled with the outcome .
" We came together as individuals , and we united as a community , " Valentich said .
" The people have spoken , and very clearly .
Our voices have been heard and thanks to the people and their strong voices , the cameras will be coming down .
It is a huge victory , and one that we can all be proud of .
And although our mayor has gone on record saying that he will fight the will of the people , his fight against the rights of the people will only bring a stronger united front from the community . "
In College Station , Texas the city 's automated ticketing vendor American Traffic Solutions ( ATS ) bankrolled a front group to conduct mass mailings and push polling in an effort to save the program that would have earned the company more than $ 11 million over the life of the contract .
The ATS - funded group reported raising $ 71,240 in contributions , but not one dollar came from anyone living in the local community .
To supplement the vendor 's effort , the city allocated taxpayer money to send red light camera promotional material to every voter .
College Station activist Jim Ash , who led the fight to put the issue on the ballot , watched the results with a large group of supporters .
" It has been nothing but celebration here , " Ash told TheNewspaper minutes after the results became final .
In Heath , voters were bombarded with the same advertisements from Redflex , but they failed to persuade a majority .
Voters also defeated Mayor Richard Waugh who had introduced photo enforcement as the signature issue of his administration .
" You can fight city hall and win , when you have a passion for what you believe in , " We Demand a Vote spokesman Lori Lyons said in a statement .
Yesterday 's results are consistent with previous public votes on the topic .
In April , eighty - six percent of the votes in Sulphur , Louisiana rejected speed cameras .
In 2008 , residents in Cincinnati , Ohio rejected red light cameras .
Seventy - six percent of Steubenville , Ohio voters rejected photo radar in 2006 .
In the mid-1990s , speed cameras lost by a two - to - one margin in Peoria , Arizona and Batavia , Illinois .
In 1997 , voters in Anchorage , Alaska banned cameras even after the local authorities had removed them .
In 2003 , 64 percent of voters in Arlington , Texas voted down " traffic management cameras " that opponents at the time said could be converted into ticketing cameras .
Voters in College Station , Texas as well as Chillicothe and Heath , Ohio vote to ban automated ticketing machines .

The triple defeat for the photo enforcement industry came despite a well - funded public relations effort in each of the cities .
In Chillicothe , Redflex Traffic Systems sent a glossy mailer to every voter while the mayor demanded that the Ohio Supreme Court ban the public from even voting on the issue -- a move high court justices swiftly rejected .
Citizens Against Photo Enforcement ( CAPE ) , the group responsible for the ballot measure , claimed an additional victory as voters elected camera opponent Bruce Arnold , who won the seat of council president , Jeremy Siberell , who won the fifth ward and Dustin Proehl , the only incumbent to have voted against cameras .
CAPE leader Rebecca Valentich told TheNewspaper that she was thrilled with the outcome .
" We came together as individuals , and we united as a community , " Valentich said .
" The people have spoken , and very clearly .
Our voices have been heard and thanks to the people and their strong voices , the cameras will be coming down .
It is a huge victory , and one that we can all be proud of .
And although our mayor has gone on record saying that he will fight the will of the people , his fight against the rights of the people will only bring a stronger united front from the community .
"
In College Station , Texas the city 's automated ticketing vendor American Traffic Solutions ( ATS ) bankrolled a front group to conduct mass mailings and push polling in an effort to save the program that would have earned the company more than $ 11 million over the life of the contract .
The ATS - funded group reported raising $ 71,240 in contributions , but not one dollar came from anyone living in the local community .
To supplement the vendor 's effort , the city allocated taxpayer money to send red light camera promotional material to every voter .
College Station activist Jim Ash , who led the fight to put the issue on the ballot , watched the results with a large group of supporters .
" It has been nothing but celebration here , " Ash told TheNewspaper minutes after the results became final .
"
You can fight city hall and win , when you have a passion for what you believe in , " We Demand a Vote spokesman Lori Lyons said in a statement .
Yesterday 's results are consistent with previous public votes on the topic .
In April , eighty - six percent of the votes in Sulphur , Louisiana rejected speed cameras .
Seventy - six percent of Steubenville , Ohio voters rejected photo radar in 2006 .
In the mid-1990s , speed cameras lost by a two - to - one margin in Peoria , Arizona and Batavia , Illinois .
In 1997 , voters in Anchorage , Alaska banned cameras even after the local authorities had removed them .
In 2003 , 64 percent of voters in Arlington , Texas voted down " traffic management cameras " that opponents at the time said could be converted into ticketing cameras .
Media Release from
Cincinnati NAACP
August 21 , 2009 The Hamilton County Board of Elections has certified the Streetcar and Water petitions .
Total signatures required for each petitions was 6,150 valid signatures .
The Streetcar petition signature count was actually 7,515 good signatures .
The Water petition met the count 6,150 threshold .
The Hamilton County Board of Elections is deciding whether to count the additional 3,500 signatures that were collected for Water .
Smitherman says , " This is great news for all groups which spent a large part of the year collecting signatures .
This is a giant step for Democracy which translates to citizen ownership in the ballot . "
The Cincinnati NAACP remains concerned that the Mayor and City Council will write confusing language for ballot .
The Cincinnati NAACP does not write the language that citizens will see on the November 2009 ballot .
The Mayor and City Council support the $ 200 million Streetcar proposal and sale of Cincinnati Water Works .
Now , City Officials are faced with the reality that both issues will be decided by voters their last chance to undermine democracy is to direct their lawyers to write confusing language for the ballot .
Smitherman says , " The Mayor and City Council must leave their Ivory Towers to run a convincing campaign that Cincinnati needs a $ 200 million streetcar and to sell their Water assets while laying off 300 city workers and while accumulating an unfunded city pension plan liability of $ 1.3 billion . "

Scientists have created a tool for mopping up the clumps of mutant protein that drive neurodegeneration in Huntington 's disease .
Emory University researchers engineered a virus to make an intracellular antibody or " intrabody " against huntingtin , the protein whose mutant forms poison the brain cells of people with Huntington's .
Injecting the virus into the brains of mice that make mutant huntingtin improves their ability to move their limbs , although it does not prolong their lives .
The results will be published online and are scheduled for publication in the May / June issue of the Journal of Cell Biology .
Although other researchers have shown that various intrabodies can protect cells from mutant huntingtin , the Emory team was the first to examine the effects of an intrabody in living mice , says senior author Xiao - Jiang Li , PhD , professor of human genetics at Emory University School of Medicine .
Delivering the intrabody to brain tissues in people would be a formidable challenge , because it would require some form of gene therapy .
However , it may be possible to use information about the intrabody 's structure to find drugs that mimic its effects , Li says .
Huntington 's affects about 30,000 people in the United States and usually begins in young - to mid-adulthood with the slow destruction of brain cells , leading to involuntary movements , cognitive impairment and sometimes depression or paranoia .
Another 150,000 people are believed to have mutations that cause the disease , but have not begun to show clinical symptoms .
The disease is fatal and currently there is no way to slow its development , although some medications can alleviate symptoms .
advertisement
Disease - causing mutations involve a lengthening of part of the gene for huntingtin , so that it repeats three letters ( CAG ) of the genetic code dozens of times .
Mutant proteins have a region consisting of the same amino acid ( glutamine ) many times , called poly - glutamine , which makes the proteins clump together inside brain cells .
Li says scientists who work on Huntington 's have been studying where inside the cell the clumps have their toxic effect : brain cells ' nuclei or in their axons and dendrites .
" Our goal here was to create a tool that could distinguish between the accumulation of mutant proteins in the nucleus and the cytoplasm , " he says .
" The intrabody binds huntingtin proteins with expanded poly - glutamine regions and it only works in the cytoplasm , not the nucleus . "
Li and his colleagues showed that cultured cells that make both the intrabody and mutant huntingtin are able to get rid of the mutant protein faster and have fewer clumps of huntingtin .
Even though the intrabody only travels within the cytoplasm , it still alleviated the motor problems of mice that make mutant huntingtin when injected into the striatum , the scientists found .
The striatum is the part of the brain most affected by Huntington 's disease .

Li says finding an antibody that prefers to bind mutant , aggregated protein could also prove useful in the study of other neurodegenerative disorders , such as Alzheimer 's disease or Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease .
" Several neurodegenerative diseases appear to involve defects in protein folding and metabolism , leading to the accumulation of protein aggregates inside cells , " he says .
" Our study suggests a strategy for dissecting the harmful effects of these protein aggregates in other diseases . "
The clumps of mutant huntingtin are also seen in the neuronal nucleus and cytoplasm in a recently established transgenic monkey model of Huntington 's , according to other recent research from Emory University researchers .
The paper 's first author is Emory postdoctoral fellow Chuan - En Wang , PhD , with contributions from Hui Zhou , PhD , John McGuire , PhD and Shi-Hua Li , PhD , from the Department of Human Genetics at Emory University School of Medicine and Vincenzo Cerullo , PhD and Brendan Lee , PhD , from the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine .
The research was funded by the High Q Foundation and the National Institutes of Health .

18 February 2004 --
As proof continues to mount that US President George Bush 's administration systematically lied about Iraq 's possession of weapons of mass destruction ( WMD ) to justify invading the oil - rich Persian Gulf country , it has been revealed that Pakistan , one of Washington 's closest allies , has been peddling nuclear weapons technology for more than a decade .
On February 4 , Abdul Qadeer Khan , dubbed the “ father ” of Pakistan 's nuclear bomb by the corporate press ' cliche mills , appeared live on national television .
He confessed that he single - handedly commanded a complex trade network in nuclear weapons technology with Iran , North Korea and Libya , which has operated since at least 1989 .
In a carefully scripted address , Khan stated that “ there was never , ever any kind of authorisation for these activities from the government ” .
Within 24 hours , Pakistani military dictator Pervez Musharraf announced that Khan had been pardoned on the recommendation of the military - dominated National Command Authority , which controls Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal , and cabinet .
Washington was equally quick to absolve Pakistan 's military government of all responsibility , describing the pardoning of Khan as an internal matter .
Associated Press reported on February 8 that , according to Pakistan 's foreign ministry , US Secretary of State Colin Powell phoned Musharraf on February 6 to express “ appreciation over the results of the investigations and the manner in which they were conducted ” .
CIA director George Tenet on February 5 declared the case closed : “ Khan and his network have been dealt a crushing blow . ”
According to the Pakistani military official who briefed the press on February 1 , Khan was the “ mastermind ” behind a sophisticated web of contractors and conduits , stretching across at least three continents .
This network manufactured , sold or bartered and delivered uranium - enrichment components and designs to Iran , North Korea and Libya .
Washington claims that Libya has turned over a blueprint for a nuclear weapon sold to it by “ the Khan network ” .
Khan supposedly had tens of millions of dollars at his fingertips to pay the players in the conspiracy ( while creaming millions off the top for himself ) , and could simply pick up a phone and order Pakistani air force cargo planes to transport nuclear parts to North Korea , and return with missile parts .
All this somehow continued , between at least 1989 and 2003 , under the noses of Pakistan 's powerful military and intelligence services without them noticing .
According to the February 3 Washington Post , Khan 's laboratory was guarded by “ two army brigadiers and a detachment from Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence agency , or ISI ” .
` Dr No ' ?
The fantastic scenario of a nefarious , real - life Dr No orchestrating a vast secret worldwide “ nuclear black market ” might make sensational copy for the world 's capitalist gutter press , but it is a ludicrous piece of fiction designed to let the Pakistani military regime , and its backers in Washington , off the hook .
It was too much for the Washington Post to swallow .
An editorial in the February 5 Post stated : “ For more than two years , the administration has embraced Mr Musharraf as a strategic ally and overlooked his suppression of Pakistani democracy and his coddling of Islamic extremists .
Now the administration must confront the reality that Pakistan 's military leadership has done more to threaten US and global security with weapons of mass destruction that either al Qaeda or Saddam Hussein .
Were Pakistan not a professed ally of the United States , its behaviour would meet the criteria for preemptive military intervention outlined in Mr Bush 's national security strategy . ”
After years of denying that Pakistan was trading in nuclear technology , the Pakistani military was forced to come up with a plausible cover story after the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) revealed that its inspectors late last year had conclusively identified Pakistani components in Iran 's uranium enrichment facilities .
The plant , which produces fuel for Iran 's atomic power stations , bore a striking similarity to Pakistan 's enrichment facility .
Documents turned over by Iran in October confirmed the source as being Pakistan .
The pressure mounted on Musharraf , after Libya in December showed IAEA inspectors hundreds of unopened crates of centrifuge parts , many of which had been imported direct from Pakistan or via Malaysia .
Libya also provided documents fingering Pakistan .
Khan's “ confession ” followed weeks of talks with senior military commanders , including ISI head Lieutenant General Ehsan ul - Haq .
The goal was to strike a deal that would result in Khan agreeing to become the scapegoat , while maintaining his status of “ national hero ” ( and his fortune ) , in return for being set free without penalty .
( It has also been reported that Khan 's daughter is in London with documentary evidence of the Pakistani military 's involvement in the nuclear trade , which she will release if her father is prosecuted . )
Islamabad and Washington had every reason to keep Khan out of an open court .
According to the February 3 Washington Post , Khan told ISI investigators that his activities were carried out with the full knowledge and approval of Pakistan 's top military leaders , who are the true rulers of Pakistan .
Approved by military chiefs
A senior Pakistani investigator told the February 3 Post that Khan said General Mirza Aslam Beg , Pakistan 's army chief of staff from 1988 to 1991 , had approved his dealings with Iran .
Khan also disclosed that Musharraf and General Jehangir Karamat , army chief from 1996 to 1998 , knew of his technology swaps with North Korea .
The February 3
Post was told by a retired army commander that the bartering of Pakistani nuclear technology in exchange for North Korean ballistic missile technology stepped up after a December 1993 visit to Pyongyang by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
The arrangements were made at the urging of General Abdul Waheed , the army chief at the time .
Musharraf was Waheed 's director - general for military operations at the time .
Soon after , Khan led a delegation of Pakistani technicians and military officers to North Korea to discuss the barter arrangements .
The retired commander added that Karamat , who replaced Waheed as army chief of staff in 1996 , secretly visited North Korea in December 1997 .
In April 1998 , Karamat was guest of honour at the successful test of Pakistan 's Ghauri missile , which was a rebadged Nodong missile from North Korea .
Musharraf took command of the Ghauri missile program when he took over the army chief of staff position in October 1998 , the investigator told the Post .
Musharraf seized power in a coup in 1999 .
The idea that four army chiefs of staff , including Musharraf himself , and two prime ministers were not aware of , or did not bother to ask , what Pyongyang was getting in return for its missile technology is beyond belief .
However , the military official who briefed reporters on February 1 let slip a sliver of the truth that lies hidden behind the carefully constructed tale of Khan 's intrigue .
“ Everybody knew ours was a covert program [ to develop nuclear weapons and their delivery systems ] , and every successive government and the security agencies overlooked allegations about Dr Khan 's assets in the interest of the program and because of the trust in this person ” , the February 3 New York Times quoted the officer as saying .
Far from being the work of a recent freelance network of greedy smugglers — as Musharraf and Washington would have the world believe — organised theft , spying and smuggling , as well as secret government - to - government and military - to - military deals , have always been an integral and essential part of Pakistan 's quest to become a nuclear - armed state .
While Khan was a leading figure in these operations , they were approved by , and directed from , the very top of the Pakistani government and military .
According to Carey Sublette 's comprehensive history of Pakistan 's nuclear weapons program ( at < http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Pakistan>), the crash program for an atomic weapon was officially launched on January 24 , 1972 , when Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto called together the country 's top nuclear scientists in the wake of Pakistan 's defeat by India a month earlier in the Bangladesh war .
On Bhutto's orders , wrote journalist Tim Weiner in the June 1 , 1998 , New York Times , “ Pakistan set up a world - wide smuggling ring to buy , copy or steal nuclear weapons technology , according to US officials and declassified government documents ” .
The Pakistani military government 's relationships with future “ trading partners ” were established in the early 1970s and ‘ 80s .
Bhutto held a series of meetings in 1973 and 1974 with the Libyan and Saudi Arabian governments to line up financing for Pakistan 's nuclear weapons program .
Clearly , the expectation was that Pakistan would share the future fruits of its program with its benefactors .
AQ Khan 's place in the network dates from September 1974 .
He was then a metallurgist employed at an Amsterdam facility associated with European uranium enrichment consortium Urenco .
With Bhutto's enthusiastic assent , Khan set about stealing Urenco centrifuge designs and information about suppliers .
On the basis of Khan 's pilfered information , components began to be purchased for Pakistan 's secret uranium enrichment program in 1975 .
By July 1976 , Bhutto had placed Khan in charge of the covert program to enrich weapons - grade uranium for Pakistan 's nukes , operating out of the Engineering Research Laboratories ( ERL ) at Kahuta , near Islamabad .
Sublette notes that the ERL purchased many of the parts needed for its centrifuge and nuclear weapons projects on the open market .
Suppliers in the Netherlands , Germany , Switzerland , France and Belgium agreed to sell Pakistan the critical components .
What could not be bought openly or legally was smuggled .
After Bhutto was overthrown in the 1977 military coup led by General Mohammed Zia ul - Haq , the nuclear weapons program continued under the military 's firm control , with the ISI playing a key role in soliciting and securing the components and technology Pakistan still required .
After Zia was assassinated in a plane explosion in 1988 , the military allowed general elections to take place three months later and permitted Bhutto 's daughter Benazir Bhutto to become prime minister .
However , the nuclear weapons program , including the KRL , remained tightly under the generals ' control .
In 1990 , fearing that Washington would impose sanctions over the military 's covert preparations to produce nuclear weapons , Benazir Bhutto demanded a greater say over the program .
On August 6 , President Ghulam Ishaq Khan , Zia 's former finance minister , sacked her .
Bhutto described it as being a “ nuclear coup ” .
According to Sublette , by 1990 Pakistan had conducted more than 24 cold tests of nuclear devices and designed a bomb small enough to be delivered by Pakistan 's US - supplied F - 16 fighter - bombers .
As tensions with India over Kashmir increased in 1990 , the Pakistani military ordered that seven “ bomb cores ” of highly enriched uranium be prepared to enable the rapid construction of nuclear weapons .
On February 7 , 1992 , Pakistani foreign minister Shahryar Khan admitted to the Washington Post that his country had the components to assemble at least one nuclear weapon .
While Pakistan was not to conduct test explosions of its nuclear weapons until 1998 , it was already a member of the nuclear club .
Washington looks the other way
Pakistan could not have emerged as a nuclear power without decades - long assistance and acquiescence by the US government .
During the Cold War , Washington sought to cultivate the Pakistani military as a counter to the Soviet Union 's friendly relations with India .
Under the “ Atoms for Peace ” program , Washington trained scores of Pakistan 's nuclear scientists from 1956 until 1972 .
In 1962 , the US gave the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission ( PAEC ) its first research reactor and supplies of nuclear fuel rods .
Despite a US law passed in 1976 ( the “ Symington amendment ” ) that required the US to suspend economic and military aid to non-signatories of the Nuclear Non-proliferation that engaged in uranium enrichment , Washington did not respond to the mounting evidence of Pakistan 's nuclear program .
It was not until the dying days of US President Jimmy Carter 's presidency , on April 6 , 1979 , that US aid to Pakistan , worth $ 85 million , was finally halted .
However , this half - hearted concern at Pakistan 's nuclear shenanigans was short - lived .
Following the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan in December 1979 , Carter offered Pakistan resumed economic and military aid of $ 400 million .
Islamabad held out for more .
In June 1981 , President Ronald Reagan announced an agreement to provide Pakistan with $ 3.2 billion in economic and military aid over the next six years .
In December 1981 , Congress approved the aid package and granted Pakistan a six - year exemption from Symington amendment sanctions .
Billions more in covert assistance from the CIA , Britain , Saudi Arabia and other sources flooded into the Pakistani military 's coffers in the 1980s .
The ISI took charge of funnelling arms and money to the feuding gangs that made up the reactionary mujaheddin fighting to overthrow Afghanistan 's Soviet - backed , left - wing government .
For Washington , defeating the Afghan “ communists ” and their Soviet backers was far more important than stemming Pakistan 's nuclear ambitions .
In July 1985 , Congress passed another $ 4 billion six - year aid package for Pakistan , but also passed the “ Pressler amendment ” , which required the US president to certify each year that Pakistan “ does not possess a nuclear device ” and was not involved in nuclear smuggling before the aid could be delivered .
Unfazed , Reagan certified Pakistan 's compliance in 1986 despite the fact that , according to the November 4 , 1986 , Washington Post , US intelligence reports and non-proliferation experts had concluded that Pakistan was between two weeks and “ two screwdriver turns from having a fully assembled bomb ” .
In 1987 , Congress approved another $ 480 million in aid for Pakistan and extended the Symington amendment exemption for another two and half years .
Despite overwhelming evidence , including public boasts by Pakistani politicians and scientists , that Pakistan had a nuclear bomb , Reagan and his successor , President George Bush senior , certified Pakistan to be free of nukes every year until 1990 ( the Soviet Union had withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan in early 1989 ) .
In October 1990 , Washington halted economic and military aid to Islamabad , worth $ 564 million , and froze government arms sales .
However , the damage had been done .
It was too late to put Pakistan 's nuclear genie back into its bottle .
As US senator John Glenn , one of the sponsors of the Symington amendment , observed in the June 26 , 1992 , International Herald Tribune : “ Nine years of US assistance had helped Pakistan release funds for its nuclear weapons program and given it the means for delivering the weapons . ”
In 1995 , the US Congress waived the Pressler amendment provisions for one year to allow the delivery of $ 368 million worth of “ non-strategic military equipment ” as part of a resumption of “ counterterrorism ” military training .
Under the US Arms Export Control Act , President Bill Clinton was supposed to impose military and economic sanctions on both Pakistan and India following their May 1998 nuclear tests .
However , fearing that US agribusiness and other economic interests would be disadvantaged , a month after the tests Congress granted both countries an exemption from sanctions for one year .
Days later , the president was given additional authority to waive sanctions for a year at a time .
Clinton swiftly restored funding for military training and commercial credit programs to both countries .
He also gave the green light to renewed International Monetary Fund loans to both countries .
Clinton also gave permission for Islamabad to be paid $ 325 million in cash and $ 140 million in goods as compensation for 28 F - 16 aircraft that Pakistan had partly paid for , but were never delivered due to the 1990 sanctions .
Following Musharraf 's coup , Washington briefly imposed tepid new sanctions .
However , these ( as well as all sanctions against India ) were waived two weeks after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks in the US as President Bush junior moved quickly to enlist both countries as close allies in his “ war on terror ” .
In a replay of its dealings with General Zia , Washington chose to place its strategic alliance with Musharraf 's regime above the need to rein in the Pakistani nuclear rogue state .
John Glenn made a prescient statement in his 1992 IHT article , which applies equally to the current Bush gang 's policies : “ The Reagan and Bush administrations have practised a nuclear non-proliferation policy bordering on lawlessness .
They have undermined the respect of other countries for US law and have done great damage to the nuclear non-proliferation effort .
“ Keep that in mind the next time someone in the administration extols the need for military action to deal with some power - hungry dictator seeking to acquire nuclear weapons . ”

( CNN ) --
A gunman attacked worshippers at a Colorado Springs , Colorado , megachurch Sunday afternoon , killing one person and wounding four others before being killed by a security staff member , the city 's police chief said .
Police would not discuss whether there was any connection between the church shootings and an attack on a missionary training center outside Denver about 12 hours earlier that left two people dead and two wounded .
The gunman in that incident was still unknown .
Chief Richard Myers called the Colorado Springs church security staffer " a courageous security staff member who probably saved many lives . "
He said some of the shooting victims being treated at the hospital have life - threatening injuries .
Several " suspicious devices " were found at the church , Myers said .
SWAT teams were clearing the multiple buildings at New Life Church , along with an explosives unit , he said .
Rev. Brady Boyd , senior pastor of New Life Church , said the church had a security plan in place .
" I 'm proud of the way our team responded , " he said .
" Many , many lives were saved because of the quick action of some committed volunteers at our church . "
Watch as a church member describes what he saw »
He said about 7,000 people were at the church , which had just completed a late - morning service , when the shooting took place shortly after 1 p.m .
The wounded were taken to Penrose - St. Francis Hospital , where two were in critical condition , Howard said .
Another patient was in good condition and one fair , hospital spokeswoman Amy Sufak said .

Police know neither the motive for the attack nor of any relationship between the suspect and the victims .
Police spokesman Lt. Fletcher Howard said area businesses were placed on lockdown after the shooting " to make sure there 's not any other suspects at large . "
As of Sunday afternoon there was no known connection between the two Colorado shootings , Howard said , but he did not rule out that possibility .
Arvada , site of the missionary training center , and Colorado Springs are about 80 miles apart .
Howard said investigators are expecting detectives from Arvada to come to Colorado Springs to check for any connections between the two cases .
In Arvada , police said they were investigating whether there was any link between the two fatal shootings .
" Obviously , two shootings at two faith - based locations is very concerning to both us and Colorado Springs , " said Deputy Police Chief Gary Creager .
New Life Church is on the northwestern outskirts of Colorado Springs , near the U.S. Air Force Academy .
The non-denominational church claims a membership of more than 10,000 .
The church was founded by the Rev. Ted Haggard , an evangelical Christian leader who was ousted in 2006 after allegations that he had been a client of a male prostitute from whom he had purchased drugs .
Haggard admitted to undisclosed " sexual immorality " and called himself " a deceiver and a liar " in a letter to the congregation .

WASHINGTON  Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked a measure intended to overturn a Supreme Court decision limiting pay discrimination suits in a politically charged vote certain to be replayed in the presidential and Congressional campaigns .
By a vote of 56 to 42 , the Senate fell four votes short of the 60 required to begin consideration of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , named for an Alabama woman who lost a case against the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company when the court found she not did file her complaint in time .
Ms. Ledbetter had been paid as much as 40 percent less than her male counterparts doing the same job , according to her allies .
The political elements of the debate were unmistakable .
Unable to reach an agreement with Republicans , Democrats did not convene the Senate until 5 p.m. so their two presidential candidates  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois  could return from the campaign trail .
Both spoke in favor of the legislation .
The campaign arm of Senate Democrats quickly issued news releases attacking Republicans up for re-election who opposed the procedural vote .
And Democrats warned Republicans that they would hear from voters on an issue of major import to women as they accused Republicans of missing an opportunity to help victims of pay discrimination pursue justice in court .

Ida Matson and Myra Beals did n't make it to their appointment to get married at San Francisco City Hall .
They were to trade vows March 12 , 2004 , a day after the California Supreme Court halted the city 's 29 - day run of same - sex nuptials .
But the couple had done some prep work .
Matson and Beals had invited loved ones to a celebration in San Francisco .
They 'd bought silver and gold rings .
After 27 years together , they were intent on getting hitched , ruling or no ruling .
So they drove to the city from their Mendocino home .
While locked in traffic in San Rafael , they slipped the rings on each others ' right hands , leaned across the center console of their 1996 Honda Accord and negotiated a speedy kiss .
" We looked at each other and said , ' We 've got to do this for ourselves , ' " Matson said Monday .
It was a private moment in what became a very public fight for them and the other 14 gay and lesbian couples who are claiming discrimination in suing the state over its law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman .
The case takes a big step today with a three - hour hearing before the state Supreme Court in San Francisco , which is considering the constitutionality of the law .
A ruling is due within 90 days .
The couples - many of whom will watch a live broadcast of today 's hearing in the Koret Auditorium of San Francisco 's Main Library - have made a point of sharing their most delicate stories .
They believe that many Americans will see their faces , feel a closer connection to the debate and change their minds .
Opponents of same - sex marriage say the emotional appeals are aimed at swaying public opinion but should mean little to the high court , which they believe ought to defer on the issue to the Legislature and the voters .
" If the court does its job , it will look solely at the law , " said Andrew Pugno , chief counsel for the Prop.
22 Legal Defense Fund , which was established to protect the 2000 ballot measure that reinforced the opposite - sex - only marriage law .
" Our system would fall apart if we changed the law every time a small minority felt personal anguish about what the law does and does not say , " Pugno said .
" I have personal anguish that I pay too much taxes , but no one feels sorry for me . "
Three of the couples suing the state spoke Monday at the San Francisco office of the National Center for Lesbian Rights , which is co-counsel for 11 couples involved in the lawsuit .
They said they started out trying to make a personal commitment , but now see an opportunity to make history .
" It 's a little scary , " said Jewelle Gomez , who lives with her partner of 16 years , Diane Sabin , in San Francisco .
" Mostly it 's an opportunity to feel everything you 're dedicated to come together in one circumstance . "
Gomez added , " It 's also a little bit annoying .
You see movies like ' The Wedding Planner ' about young love .
But those people are n't putting their lives together under the scrutiny of the Supreme Court and the press . "
One couple initially involved in the lawsuit split up after an eight - year relationship .
Those who remain range in age from late 30s to late 80s .
One couple has been together for eight years , while San Francisco activists Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin have endured for 56 .
They were the first to marry at City Hall in February 2004 .
Jeanne Rizzo and Pali Cooper of Tiburon were the first to be denied a month later , told they could n't wed in front of more than 50 supporters .
Rizzo broke down , as photos in what would have been her wedding album show .
The couple still had a party that night , though their guests did n't know whether to bring along gifts .
Within hours , Rizzo and Cooper had been enlisted to sue the state and had written declarations on their plight .
That night , Cooper said , the private became public .
" I realized it was n't about us anymore , but about the issue , " she said .
" It switched to become an opportunity . "
The past four years have seen both high and low moments , the couples said .
To hear their lawyers argue in court , they said , is to have some of their greatest wishes expressed on a grand stage .
To go to the weddings of straight friends is to feel " twinges of longing , " said Rizzo .
To see a child holding a sign outside a courthouse that says , " God made Adam and Eve , not Adam and Steve , " is frightening , Gomez said .
The couples point out that their ability to enter into domestic partnerships does not guarantee them rights equal to married spouses , such as insurance and Social Security payments to survivors .
" I never know that if something happened to one of us , whether we'd be able to speak for each other and have it honored , " Beals said .
" That 's a little scary . "
Also worrisome to the couples is the prospect of defeat , of losing both the personal and the larger fight .
" It will be very personal if this does n't turn out the way we want , " Gomez said .
" You bank so much on spending the rest of your life together . "
A successful Chinese missile test last year that destroyed one of China ’s own aging satellites has substantially added to space debris around Earth , increasing the danger that a chain reaction of colliding space junk could threaten parts of the world ’s satellite network , scientists said Tuesday .
The threat is that debris could begin slamming into other debris , creating a cascading effect called supercriticality , according to scientists addressing the American Physical Society conference here this week .
“ Debris in space is already a problem , ” said David Wright , a senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge , Mass .
“ But it ’s potentially a very big problem . ”
Geoffrey Forden , an MIT physicist and expert on the Chinese space program , said the danger from space debris was actually more of a worry than the threat that the Chinese , or some other country , could intentionally cripple American space assets with antisatellite weapons .

Forden argued that America ’s redundancy in space satellite systems made it almost invulnerable to that kind of attack , and that it would be relatively easy to spot the Chinese readying a launch .
On the other hand , he said , “ We are in danger of a runaway escalation of space debris . ”
According to Wright , the Chinese shoot - down on Jan. 11 , 2007 , added more than 2 million pieces of debris in low - Earth orbit , where most satellites are located .
Because there is already so much debris -- more than 150 million pieces , most of them less than 2 inches across -- even if nothing more is added , the amount will still increase by a factor of three in the next 200 years due to the fragmentation of pieces from collisions and other reasons .

That could be a low estimate if more antisatellite tests take place .
Destruction of a single 10 - ton satellite could contribute as many as 15 million pieces of junk , thousands of them more than a foot across .
Even now , a satellite orbiting Earth passes within 60 miles of a piece of junk several thousand times a day and has a 1 % chance each year of getting hit .
“ Space is not a big , empty place , ” Forden said .
In February , the U.S. demonstrated its own antisatellite capability , shooting down a dead spy satellite .
But that did n’t pose the danger of the Chinese test because the U.S. satellite was in a low enough orbit -- 125 miles up -- that the debris will soon burn up in Earth ’s atmosphere .

The Chinese missile struck a satellite orbiting 530 miles above Earth , meaning the debris will remain in space for hundreds of years , the scientists said .
Still , Forden called the Bush administration decision to shoot down its satellite “ bad policy ” because it could encourage other nations to build their own antisatellite weapons .
The U.S. began to recognize the threat from space junk about a decade ago , Wright said .
Since then , it has been taking measures to reduce the amount of new debris .
Those efforts had largely succeeded until the Chinese demonstration .
Forden said the threat of supercriticality was a warning that it was time to treat space not as a vast junkyard , but as a natural resource that must be protected the same way we were learning to protect resources on Earth .

“ We ’re fortunate we have n’t really screwed things up yet , ” Wright said .
“ But the Chinese test brought home how quickly this could get out of hand . ”

For three decades Vice President Dick Cheney conducted a secretive , behind - closed - doors campaign to give the president virtually unlimited wartime power .
Finally , in the aftermath of 9/11 , the Justice Department and the White House made a number of controversial legal decisions .
Orchestrated by Cheney and his lawyer David Addington , the department interpreted executive power in an expansive and extraordinary way , granting President George W. Bush the power to detain , interrogate , torture , wiretap and spy -- without congressional approval or judicial review .
Now , as the White House appears ready to ignore subpoenas in the investigations over wiretapping and U.S. attorney firings , FRONTLINE examines the battle over the power of the presidency and Cheney 's way of looking at the Constitution .
" The vice president believes that Congress has very few powers to actually constrain the president and the executive branch , " former Justice Department attorney Marty Lederman tells FRONTLINE .
" He believes the president should have the final word -- indeed the only word -- on all matters within the executive branch . "
After Sept. 11 , Cheney and Addington were determined to implement their vision -- in secret .
The vice president and his counsel found an ally in John Yoo , a lawyer at the Justice Department 's extraordinarily powerful Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) .
In concert with Addington , Yoo wrote memoranda authorizing the president to act with unparalleled authority .
" Through interviews with key administration figures , Cheney 's Law documents the bruising bureaucratic battles between a group of conservative Justice Department lawyers and the Office of the Vice President over the legal foundation for the most closely guarded programs in the war on terror , " says FRONTLINE producer Michael Kirk .
This is Kirk 's 10th documentary about the Bush administration 's policies since 9/11 .
In his most extensive television interview since leaving the Justice Department , former Assistant Attorney General Jack L. Goldsmith describes his initial days at the OLC in the fall of 2003 as he learned about the government 's most secret and controversial covert operations .
Goldsmith was shocked by the administration 's secret assertion of unlimited power .
" There were extravagant and unnecessary claims of presidential power that were wildly overbroad to the tasks at hand , " Goldsmith says .
" I had a whole flurry of emotions .
My first one was disbelief that programs of this importance could be supported by legal opinions that were this flawed .
My second was the realization that I would have a very , very hard time standing by these opinions if pressed .
My third was the sinking feeling , what was I going to do if I was pressed about reaffirming these opinions ? "
As Goldsmith began to question his colleagues ' claims that the administration could ignore domestic laws and international treaties , he began to clash with Cheney 's office .
According to Goldsmith , Addington warned him , " If you rule that way , the blood of the 100,000 people who die in the next attack will be on your hands . "
Goldsmith 's battles with Cheney culminated in a now - famous hospital - room confrontation at Attorney General John Ashcroft 's bedside .
Goldsmith watched as White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and Chief of Staff Andy Card pleaded with Ashcroft to overrule the department 's finding that a domestic surveillance program was illegal .
Ashcroft rebuffed the White House , and as many as 30 department lawyers threatened to resign .
The president relented .
But Goldsmith 's victory was temporary , and Cheney 's Law continues the story after the hospital - room standoff .
At the Justice Department , White House Counsel Gonzales was named attorney general and tasked with reasserting White House control .
On Capitol Hill , Cheney lobbied Congress for broad authorizations for the eavesdropping program and for approval of the administration 's system for trying suspected terrorists by military tribunals .
As the White House and Congress continue to face off over executive privilege , the terrorist surveillance program , and the firing of U.S. attorneys , FRONTLINE tells the story of what 's formed the views of the man behind what some view as the most ambitious project to reshape the power of the president in American history .
Flickr product strategist Matthew Rothenberg offers fresh doughnuts to the crowd .
SAN FRANCISCO – A Flickr protest spawned a sugary snackfest Wednesday as dozens of people turned out to enjoy free doughnuts handed out by the popular photo - sharing site .
Dubbed The Day of the Donut by Flickr group We Demand Donuts , the event began as a way to make light of the latest controversy to bubble up among the photo site 's famously finicky users .
This time , some Flickr fans are up in arms because the site decided last week to let " Pro " users upload 90 - second video clips .
" Who does n't deserve a doughnut ? " said Flickr employee Matthew Rothenberg , who agreed to buy the fried treats for anyone who showed up at Bob 's Donut and Pastry Shop in San
Francisco's Nob Hill neighborhood .
" After I found the group , I 'd made my decision within an hour [ to organize the San
Francisco event ] .
And now , there 's all kinds of groups demanding things , like free pancakes . "
The doughnut demand quickly steamrolled into an worldwide event after We Demand Donuts posted its mocking manifesto : " If we get 20,000 people to join the group , Flickr will be forced to give us free donuts ! "
People around the world planned informal meet - ups to eat doughnuts – and to snap photos of the gatherings , of course .
Flickr only organized ( and paid for doughnuts ) at the San Francisco gathering .
Rothenberg bought 10 dozen boxes of glazed , powder - coated and chocolate doughnuts and passed them around to Flickr employees and users who stood around chatting outside the shop Wednesday .
" It 's like a flash mob , " said Michael Michael , a long - time Flickr user and a San Francisco resident , of the gathering .
" Though I 'm still not sure about the video feature . "
We Demand Donuts sprang up long before the video feature was added , but the group never had much of a following until last week , according to Jake Rome , who started the group in 2007 .
Shortly after the option to include video was added and several groups protesting the new feature emerged , the We Demand Donuts movement gathered steam .
" It 's a very Flickr response ... whimsical , " said Heather Champ , director of communications at Flickr .
" I think some people did n't quite know how to respond to the new [ video ] feature , so they chose to get behind this . "
Iain Burke , a University of California at Berkeley student and Flickr user , said he came to the city Wednesday just to get a free donut .
" I am worried about YouTube junk coming into Flickr , " he said .
" But [ video ] is a good idea . "
No word yet of a We Demand Free Beer Flickr group yet , but Rothenberg promised he'd consider a similar giveaway if such a group were created and enough members joined .
" We 're open to it , " he laughed while handing a chocolate - covered doughnut to a passerby .

In networked industries , like social networking web sites and Internet auction houses , the purchase of a product by a new customer creates value for existing customers .
The classic example is the telephone ; the more people who have phones , the more people you can call , making the value of your phone go up with the number of phone users .
Start -ups are very popular in networked industries these days .
So a lot of people ask me what ’s different about starting a company in a networked industry .
Here are four aspects of strategy that are different in networked industries .
( I have taken them from my textbook , Technology Strategy for Managers and Entrepreneurs )
1. Start large .
Networked industries display increasing returns to scale and tend to be winner - take - all businesses .
To succeed in these industries , you need to be large ; and being large means making big bets in the beginning .
As a result , the time - honored method of bootstrapping wo n’t work and you will probably need to raise gobs of venture capital to put the business in place .
2. Focus on your installed base .
Your installed base ( number of current users ) is a key metric in networked industries .
These industries tend to converge on the product with the most customers .
New customers derive the most value from buying from companies with the most users at any point in time , and providers of complementary products are most interested in offering products for the producers with the most users .
3 . Use penetration pricing to target the mass market .
If you want to build your installed base fast , then you want to go after the mass market from the start , rather than focusing your attention on the innovators and early adopters .
The mass market is a much larger group of customers , which is what you need to build your installed base quickly .
In addition , you want to charge a very low price to get those customers .
How low ?
Probably negative , like PayPal did when it first started and put ten bucks in the account of its initial users .
Paying people to be your customers builds your installed base quickly .
4 . Be a first mover .
When building an installed base fast is a key to success , you need to move quickly .
This means you are probably better off getting a flawed product on the market earlier and fixing it as you go , than being the second mover with a better product .
Customers might not switch to your better product if your competitor has a large number of users for its more flawed product .
You are also probably better off creating a virtual company and contracting for the different assets that you need than building them from scratch .
It is almost always faster to sign a deal to work with someone who already has manufacturing or marketing assets in place than building them yourself .

I think we 've reached a signal point in the campaign .
This is the point where , with Hillary Clinton , either you get it or you do n't .
There 's no dodging now .
You either understand the problem with her candidacy , or you do n't .
You either understand who she is , or not .
And if you do n't , after 16 years of watching Clintonian dramas , you probably never will .
That 's what the Bosnia story was about .
Her fictions about dodging bullets on the tarmac -- and we have to hope they were lies , because if they were n't , if she thought what she was saying was true , we are in worse trouble than we thought -- either confirmed what you already knew ( she lies as a matter of strategy , or , as William Safire said in 1996 , by nature ) or revealed in an unforgettable way ( videotape !
Smiling girl in pigtails offering flowers ! ) what you feared ( that she lies more than is humanly usual , even politically usual ) .
But either you get it now or you never will .
That 's the importance of the Bosnia tape .
Many in the press get it , to their dismay , and it makes them uncomfortable , for it sours life to have a person whose character you feel you cannot admire play such a large daily role in your work .
But I think it 's fair to say of the establishment media at this point that it is well populated by people who feel such a lack of faith in Mrs. Clinton 's words and ways that it amounts to an aversion .
They are offended by how she and her staff operate .
They try hard to be fair .
They constantly have to police themselves .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - A California man who has defaulted on nine homes and expects banks to foreclose on all of them , forcing him into bankruptcy , says he now considers it a mistake to have invested in the real estate market .
Shawn Forgaard poses with his wife Shauna , infant son Chase and their dog Hudson in front of their Santa Cruz , California home in this self - portrait photo released to Reuters May 10 , 2008 .
Forgaard , a 37 - year - old software company manager , bought one home for his family to live in and nine more as investments .
He stands to lose all the investment houses in the mortgage meltdown but says he has come away wiser from the experience .

Shawn Forgaard , a 37 - year - old software company project manager , bought one home for his family to live in and nine more as investments .
He stands to lose all the investment houses in the mortgage meltdown but says he has come away wiser from the experience .
“ Everyone stumbles .
I ’m not going to hide or run or live in denial , or with regrets , ” Forgaard told Reuters in an interview .
“ On the surface it looks like total devastation but it ’s just the opposite .
I ’m confident our lives will be much , much richer as a result . ”
Forgaard bought a house in Santa Cruz , about 60 miles ( 100 km ) south of San Francisco , in 2000 .
Four years later , using $ 800,000 in stock options , he began snapping up investment properties , putting 10 percent to 40 percent down on negative amortization loans -- in which payments do not cover the interest so that a borrower ’s balance grows over time .
It was those “ neg - am ” loans , which include triggers causing payments to balloon if the debt reaches a certain percentage of the original balance , that would come back to haunt him .
“ I knew I was sitting on time bombs , ” Forgaard said .
“ I knew the market was going to go soft and I knew that property values would decline .
But I figured that I had enough equity to survive the storm and sell or take the loss and refinance .
“ I did n’t anticipate a downturn of epic proportions such that home values are 40 percent less than they were , ” he said .
The mortgage market has melted down in the past two years in a crisis that began in the subprime sector and has left millions of Americans facing the possibility of foreclosure on their homes .
‘ THIS COULD GET UGLY ’
Forgaard bought his first investment home in the booming housing market of North Las Vegas in 2004 , followed in the next two years by eight others in such hot markets as Phoenix and Palm Springs , California , before he realized in 2006 that the situation was worse than he had feared .
“ I knew that the market was soft but at that point I ’m realizing that this could really get ugly , ” he said .
“ At that point I had a bad feeling in my stomach . ”
Forgaard thought he still had enough equity in the homes to “ take a huge hit , ” possibly losing most of his investment , but thought for a while that he could still ride out the storm .
“ It really was n’t until five months ago that I realized , ‘ Hey , you know what ?
Not only am I going to lose everything I have invested but this is going to force me into bankruptcy , ” he said .
“ I ’m going to lose my car and my primary ( home ) and we ’re not going to be able to live in Santa Cruz , where I was born and raised , and live by the beach .
And that was pretty tough to take . ”
Experts say speculators like Forgaard , who count on real estate values to keep rising to pay off their debt , play a risky game and doubly so when they use neg - am loans .
“ You are essentially betting the house on the strength of the housing market and if you ’re that leveraged in debt and the market goes down , you ’re going to lose your shirt , ” said Austin King , director of the community organizer ACORN ’s Financial Justice Center .
“ To do it eight or nine times over is eight or nine times as foolish as just doing it once , ” he said .
The Forgaards likely will sell their Santa Cruz home and declare bankruptcy before banks start foreclosing on his properties .
With a newborn son , they intend to start over in his wife ’s Northern California hometown .
Forgaard said that some good has come out of the experience and that his family is optimistic .
He is relieved that he no longer has to deal with 10 homes at once and now will pursue a lifelong dream of starting his own business .
“ Where I went wrong is I invested heavily in an area that was n’t my passion and I had a really demanding full - time job so I could n’t pay attention to nuances , the little indicators telling you the housing market was going soft , ” he said .
“ I was in over my head . ”
APRIL 23 -- A Florida man is facing elder abuse charges after he allegedly filmed his senile 85 - year - old grandmother wearing a ski mask and holding a gun for a ' Gangstas and Thugs ' street DVD series .
Michael Alfinez , 18 , was arrested yesterday by Palm Beach sheriff 's deputies , who began their probe after a troubling video was seized earlier this year during a traffic stop .
According to a sheriff 's report , a copy of which you 'll find here , Alfinez admitted filming his grandmother , Marie Huertas , and placing a ski mask on the senior citizen .
He also acknowledged telling Huertas what to say on the video .
Alfinez is pictured in the mug shot at left ; Huertas , in a ski mask , can be seen in the adjacent video screen grab .
The report notes that Huertas , who is holding a . 22 - caliber gun and appears ' disoriented ' in the video , makes a series of profane threats and statements like , ' Fuck you if you do n't like this , ' ' I 'll shoot you , ' and ' Palm Beach County , bitch . '
When investigators showed Huertas the video , ' she appeared to be shocked ' at her recorded comments , and remarked , ' they are making a criminal out of me . '
In addition to the abuse charge , Alfinez is facing weapons charges since the video also shows him ( and two pals ) firing a gun from a moving vehicle .
Alfinez said that he got the idea to film his grandmother from an earlier ' Gangstas and Thugs ' production ( which apparently featured another pensioner ) .
Alfinez told investigators that he ' knew my grandma could be like that too or better . ' ( 3 pages )

I want to thank all those people who made this possible .
In particular George Bush and Osama bin Laden .
Without you guys this just would n’t have been possible .
Of course there are so many to thank .
I should mention Pat Robertson , Jerry Falwell as well but it was really the little people who deserve the thanks .
All those people bashing on gays , bombing abortion clinics , closing down adult shops .
And we ca n’t forget the guys who arrest people for selling dildos , or cut off the heads of infidels or slit the throats of sinners .
And all those parents who murder their own children in ‘ honor ’ killings or let them die without medical care because medicine indicates a lack of faith .
Your campaigns in the Shiavo case , to promote ‘ faith based ’ initiatives and to eradicate the separation of church and state , or mosque and state helped .
All of you made this possible .
Without your help we would n’t be where we are today .
Thanks for making this possible .
Responding to a tidal wave of outrage , Sony has reversed a plan to charge $ 50 to remove all the pre-installed applications — often derided as " bloatware " or " craplets " — from its high - end TZ - series notebooks .
Earlier today , PC World reported that Sony would charge $ 50 for a configuration option called " Fresh Start , " which would not include the bloatware .
When contacted by Gadget Lab , a spokesperson for Sony said that the company will now remove that charge .
" There will be no charge for Fresh Start , " said the spokesman .
Like many notebook manufacturers , Sony preloads its notebooks with anti-virus , anti-spyware and other useful software .
Problems arise when such applications swiftly expire , offer limited functionality , or result in poor system performance–or when there is simply so much of it that it can not be easily removed .
Fresh Start will now be a no-cost option on Sony 's slick subnotebooks , but only for those who opt for Windows Vista Business Edition , a $ 100 upgrade .
Most sites covering the $ 50 Fresh Start charge were incensed at the idea of being charged to leave malfunctioning and unwanted software off – and Sony has responded with a speed unusual for the international giant .
" It 's clear that it 's an unpopular thing to have that much crapware on your system , " said Richard Shim , an IDC analyst , before the company 's reversal .
" But Sony 's move makes people feel like a pawn between manufacture and software provider .
The feeling is you 're being exploited , like someone 's making money off our your own personal pain in the butt . "
Equipment manufacturers , he said , lose a revenue stream when they do n't include the software .
But that decision must be balanced against customers ' desire for fast , cleanly - configured hardware .
" Which would you rather deal with : Loss of revenue or loss of customer satisfaction ? " said Shim , who implied — accurately , it turned out — that it would be watching the response closely .
" It seems like they 're ( Sony ) testing the waters to see what the customer threshold is for paying more for less headaches .
... I do n't think it will go over well . "
Earlier today , blogs erupted with outrage at the planned charge , with Engadget opening a headline with " Sony Hates You . "
This writer 's seen the results of indiscriminate software installation before from Sony , which might be forgiven for anticipating that people would be pay to be free of it .
For example , the following screen grab shows a stack of preloaded applications – some of which wo n't work properly on the notebook – shortly after a Sony notebook 's first boot - up .
This was what came up the first time I booted up a $ 2,700 Vaio SZ sent in for review .
It 's possible that the production process itself is so streamlined that the unwanted software is burned onto the hard drive in the factory – thus incurring further costs to remove it afterwards .
Among the software included on TZ systems , which " Fresh Start " will remove , are the " specific VAIO applications , " Microsoft Works Special Edition , trial versions of Microsoft Office and Corel Paint Shop Pro ; and a crippled version of QuickBooks that can only track 20 customers .

Mr Frattini said the EU must use " the most advanced technology "
Biometric tests at Frankfurt airport
He said travellers from outside the EU could face a biometric test as part of their visa while those not needing a permit would be checked on arrival .
There are also plans to improve border surveillance and land and sea patrols .
Rights group Privacy International said the move could create a " fortress Europe " for foreigners .
And the European Council on Refugees in Exile complained that the tighter the restrictions , the harder it would become for people to seek safety from persecution .
' Highest security level '
The proposals for a radical shake - up of the EU 's border security were unveiled by Mr Frattini in Brussels .
Mr Frattini says the plans will have to be agreed by member states
He said the measures would apply to all 24 members of the Schengen accord , and it was up to countries such as the UK and Ireland whether to join in .
The commissioner said the EU had to use " the most advanced technology to reach the highest level of security " to stop visitors overstaying their welcome in Europe and to prevent terrorists from coming in .
EU BORDERS EU has 1,792 designated external border crossing points with controls 665 air border crossing points , 871 sea borders and 246 land borders 300 m crossings per year at these points 160 m crossings by EU citizens , 60 m by non-EU without visa , 80 m by non-EU with visa Estimated 8 m illegal immigrants in EU , half came in legally but overstayed
The plans would also allow for a Registered Traveller Programme to enable EU citizens to pass through customs with only random checks .
That could be extended to include non-EU citizens on multiple visas .
Mr Frattini said he hoped the reforms - if approved by all the EU member states - would be introduced between 2010 - 2015 .
Illegal immigrants
A central aim of the measures is tackling the large number of illegal immigrants who came into the EU legally : " The factor number one is over - stayers in Europe , " Mr Frattini said .
Under the proposed entry and exit register , an alert would be sent when a visa expired and no exit had been recorded .
Biometric technology is already being introduced .
From 2009 , all EU passports will feature a digital fingerprint and photograph and , from 2011 non-EU citizens who apply for a visa will have to give their biometric details .
Currently , anyone crossing a border into the EU's 24 Schengen countries faces a minimum entry and exit check , whether they are an EU citizen or not .
Non-EU nationals face a more thorough check , including a search of databases .
Satellite tracking
As well as improved border controls , the commission also wants to toughen up patrols , focusing particularly on illegal migration routes to the Canary Islands and across the Mediterranean and Black Sea .
HAVE YOUR SAY
No measure is too much if human rights are not tampered with .
Anthony Augustine , UK
A surveillance system ( Eurosur ) would be set up which would use state - of - the - art technology such as satellites and aerial drones .
" We cannot have mafia or traffickers or terrorists using better technology than our police , " Mr Frattini said .
There would also be further operations involving the EU 's border agency , Frontex .
The proposals will have to be agreed by member states and MEPs before they can come into effect .
Recently we 've seen a great divergence in commodity prices .
While oil and most other commodities have continued to rise sharply make new all time high , gold along with silver is trading significantly - more than 10 % - below their all time highs reached earlier this year .
As a result , the gold / oil ratio is down to 7.5 , down from 10 in mid-March .
What , then , is the cause of this ?
Will this trend continue ?
The cause for this divergence is that oil price movements , apart from non-monetary factors , reflect actual inflation while gold price movements mainly reflect movements in inflationary expectations among investors , or to be more precise their demand for gold as an inflation hedge .
Actual inflationary pressures remain strong which is the primary reason for why oil has risen so much in price .
Meanwhile , gold and silver has taken a beating as demand for them as an inflation hedge has cooled .
Instead , many investors have moved their money back into stocks , which can also potentially be an inflation hedge , as inflation also mean that the nominal earnings of companies are inflated .
Will this persist ?
Well , oil will continue to rise , albeit perhaps briefly interrupted by corrections .
Gold weakness will perhaps continue for a while because of the current bearish sentiment , but in a few months or so , it will recover .
The reason is that while stocks are an inflation hedge , they are not recession hedges .
In recessions their earnings decline .
Which is what we 've seen despite positive currency effects .
And once investors again are reminded about that , they will again move their money out of stocks .
And at that point , many will choose the investment object that is a hedge against both recessions and inflation , namely gold .
The ability of otherwise rational people to continue to bury their heads in the sand when it comes to the glaring problems with the U.S. government ’s official story of the attacks of 9/11 . . . appears to be nearing a rapidly escalating end .
Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels stated at the Nuremburg War Crimes Trials , “ Propaganda is not meant to fool the intelligencia , it is merely meant to provide them an excuse to avoid seeing ugly realities , they ’d sooner not believe . ”
On April 10 , 2008 , the New York Sun Newspaper reported on a new U.N. Human Rights Council official assigned to monitor Israel , who is calling for an official commission to study the role neoconservatives may have played in the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
The Sun reported that the UN official calling for the 9/11 - neocon link study , who was unanimously appointed to his UN position on March 26 , is Richard Falk , Milbank professor of international law emeritus at Princeton University .
This explosive development builds on a growing tsunami of such demands .
Years ago former German national minister and parliamentarian Andreas Von Bulow , was joined by UK former national minister and parliamentarian , in stating that the evidence indicates that 9/11 was orchestrated by elements within the U.S. government .
Around that time I had the opportunity to interview Paul Hellyer , who served as a Canadian Minister of National Defence .
In that role Hellyer was very familiar with normal NORAD Air Defence procedures , and expressed to me his deep concern that the US Air Force was mysteriously absent on the morning of 9/11 , and that he felt an urgent need for a new investigation .
Since then hundreds of military , intelligence , engineering , architectural , and government experts have come out publicly doubting the official story , and many saying outright that the evidence indicates that elements of the U.S. government had to have executed the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Their statements are available for viewing at www.PatriotsQuestion911.org .
The tsunami of international suspicion preceding this week ’s explosive demand by the U.N. official , appeared to have crested and begun its crushing descent in the last few weeks , which began when Japanese Senator Fujita grilled the Japanese Prime Minister on national television for nearly 30 minutes .
In that time Fujita laid out and presented graphics indicating that the American government had not only lied to Japan about 9/11 , but that pointed to likely US government involvement in the attacks .
Fujita stated that many ministers of the Japanese Parliament thanked him for his courage and expressed their own suspicions of the US Government ’s official 9/11 story .
This jives with my experience when years ago , as the Director of National 911 Visibility , I began corresponding with Paul Lannoye , a European Parliamentarian who represented Belgium .
The result of our communications was revealed in the following letter , Parliamentarian Lannoye later released on 24 May , 2004
Dear World Legislators , Parliamentarians , and World Citizens ,
We have watched with alarm that the sad and tragic events of 9 - 11 ( 11 September , 2001 ) have resulted in two wars and a global rollback in civil liberties .
Iraq had nothing to do with the 9 - 11 attacks , yet it has been attacked in the name of them .
People in countries worldwide have suffered reduced civil liberties in the name of 9 - 11 , and intelligence surveillance of ordinary citizens has expanded dramatically .
I submit to you that before any more wars are launched or liberties are lost in the name of the " war on terror " launched by the Bush Administration after 9 - 11 , a full international inquiry into the events leading up to and on 9 - 11 be held , which includes 9 - 11 victims ' family members from the U.S. and other nations .
The National Green Party of the United States has requested an open independent 9 - 11 investigation that would involve 9 - 11 victims ' family members .
This is a good start , but it must also be an international inquiry in addition that includes 9 - 11 family members from nations worldwide who lost loved ones in the 9 - 11 attacks .
We need this to occur because many , including the 9 - 11 Family Steering Committee ( U.S. ) , are growing increasingly frustrated with the stunning lack of hard questions for witnesses appearing before the 9 - 11 Commission .
Until these hard questions are asked and fully answered , we should refuse more wars , and renounce reduced liberty worldwide in the name of 9 - 11 and it's resultant war on terror . . .
. . .
I implore legislators , parliamentarians , and citizens worldwide to become involved in the global 9 - 11 Truth Movement by signing up at www.911Visibility.org and www.911Truth.org.
These organizations have worked with 9 - 11 family members , and citizens worldwide to lobby government , media , and the 9 - 11 Commission to demand truth , and to hold public actions to educate the world about the apparent 9 - 11 cover up .
Warm regards ,

Existentialism
Is a Humanism

My purpose here is to offer a defence of existentialism against several reproaches that have been laid against it .
First , it has been reproached as an invitation to people to dwell in quietism of despair .
For if every way to a solution is barred , one would have to regard any action in this world as entirely ineffective , and one would arrive finally at a contemplative philosophy .
Moreover , since contemplation is a luxury , this would be only another bourgeois philosophy .
This is , especially , the reproach made by the Communists .
From another quarter we are reproached for having underlined all that is ignominious in the human situation , for depicting what is mean , sordid or base to the neglect of certain things that possess charm and beauty and belong to the brighter side of human nature : for example , according to the Catholic critic , Mlle .
Mercier , we forget how an infant smiles .
Both from this side and from the other we are also reproached for leaving out of account the solidarity of mankind and considering man in isolation .
And this , say the Communists , is because we base our doctrine upon pure subjectivity – upon the Cartesian “ I think ” : which is the moment in which solitary man attains to himself ; a position from which it is impossible to regain solidarity with other men who exist outside of the self .
The ego cannot reach them through the cogito .
From the Christian side , we are reproached as people who deny the reality and seriousness of human affairs .
For since we ignore the commandments of God and all values prescribed as eternal , nothing remains but what is strictly voluntary .
Everyone can do what he likes , and will be incapable , from such a point of view , of condemning either the point of view or the action of anyone else .
It is to these various reproaches that I shall endeavour to reply today ; that is why I have entitled this brief exposition “ Existentialism is a Humanism . ”
Many may be surprised at the mention of humanism in this connection , but we shall try to see in what sense we understand it .
In any case , we can begin by saying that existentialism , in our sense of the word , is a doctrine that does render human life possible ; a doctrine , also , which affirms that every truth and every action imply both an environment and a human subjectivity .
The essential charge laid against us is , of course , that of over - emphasis upon the evil side of human life .
I have lately been told of a lady who , whenever she lets slip a vulgar expression in a moment of nervousness , excuses herself by exclaiming , “ I believe I am becoming an existentialist . ”
So it appears that ugliness is being identified with existentialism .
That is why some people say we are “ naturalistic , ” and if we are , it is strange to see how much we scandalise and horrify them , for no one seems to be much frightened or humiliated nowadays by what is properly called naturalism .
Those who can quite well keep down a novel by Zola such as La Terre are sickened as soon as they read an existentialist novel .
Those who appeal to the wisdom of the people – which is a sad wisdom – find ours sadder still .
And yet , what could be more disillusioned than such sayings as “ Charity begins at home ” or “ Promote a rogue and he ’ll sue you for damage , knock him down and he ’ll do you homage ” ?
We all know how many common sayings can be quoted to this effect , and they all mean much the same – that you must not oppose the powers that be ; that you must not fight against superior force ; must not meddle in matters that are above your station .
Or that any action not in accordance with some tradition is mere romanticism ; or that any undertaking which has not the support of proven experience is foredoomed to frustration ; and that since experience has shown men to be invariably inclined to evil , there must be firm rules to restrain them , otherwise we shall have anarchy .
It is , however , the people who are forever mouthing these dismal proverbs and , whenever they are told of some more or less repulsive action , say “ How like human nature ! ” – it is these very people , always harping upon realism , who complain that existentialism is too gloomy a view of things .
Indeed their excessive protests make me suspect that what is annoying them is not so much our pessimism , but , much more likely , our optimism .
For at bottom , what is alarming in the doctrine that I am about to try to explain to you is – is it not ?
– that it confronts man with a possibility of choice .
To verify this , let us review the whole question upon the strictly philosophic level .
What , then , is this that we call existentialism ?
Most of those who are making use of this word would be highly confused if required to explain its meaning .
For since it has become fashionable , people cheerfully declare that this musician or that painter is “ existentialist . ”
A columnist in Clartes signs himself “ The Existentialist , ” and , indeed , the word is now so loosely applied to so many things that it no longer means anything at all .
It would appear that , for the lack of any novel doctrine such as that of surrealism , all those who are eager to join in the latest scandal or movement now seize upon this philosophy in which , however , they can find nothing to their purpose .
For in truth this is of all teachings the least scandalous and the most austere : it is intended strictly for technicians and philosophers .
All the same , it can easily be defined .
The question is only complicated because there are two kinds of existentialists .
There are , on the one hand , the Christians , amongst whom I shall name Jaspers and Gabriel Marcel , both professed Catholics ; and on the other the existential atheists , amongst whom we must place Heidegger as well as the French existentialists and myself .
What they have in common is simply the fact that they believe that existence comes before essence – or , if you will , that we must begin from the subjective .
What exactly do we mean by that ?
If one considers an article of manufacture as , for example , a book or a paper - knife – one sees that it has been made by an artisan who had a conception of it ; and he has paid attention , equally , to the conception of a paper - knife and to the pre-existent technique of production which is a part of that conception and is , at bottom , a formula .
Thus the paper - knife is at the same time an article producible in a certain manner and one which , on the other hand , serves a definite purpose , for one cannot suppose that a man would produce a paper - knife without knowing what it was for .
Let us say , then , of the paperknife that its essence – that is to say the sum of the formulae and the qualities which made its production and its definition possible – precedes its existence .
The presence of such - and - such a paper - knife or book is thus determined before my eyes .
Here , then , we are viewing the world from a technical standpoint , and we can say that production precedes existence .
When we think of God as the creator , we are thinking of him , most of the time , as a supernal artisan .
Whatever doctrine we may be considering , whether it be a doctrine like that of Descartes , or of Leibnitz himself , we always imply that the will follows , more or less , from the understanding or at least accompanies it , so that when God creates he knows precisely what he is creating .
Thus , the conception of man in the mind of God is comparable to that of the paper - knife in the mind of the artisan :
God makes man according to a procedure and a conception , exactly as the artisan manufactures a paper - knife , following a definition and a formula .
Thus each individual man is the realisation of a certain conception which dwells in the divine understanding .
In the philosophic atheism of the eighteenth century , the notion of God is suppressed , but not , for all that , the idea that essence is prior to existence ; something of that idea we still find everywhere , in Diderot , in Voltaire and even in Kant .
Man possesses a human nature ; that “ human nature , ” which is the conception of human being , is found in every man ; which means that each man is a particular example of a universal conception , the conception of Man .
In Kant , this universality goes so far that the wild man of the woods , man in the state of nature and the bourgeois are all contained in the same definition and have the same fundamental qualities .
Here again , the essence of man precedes that historic existence which we confront in experience .
Atheistic existentialism , of which I am a representative , declares with greater consistency that if God does not exist there is at least one being whose existence comes before its essence , a being which exists before it can be defined by any conception of it .
That being is man or , as Heidegger has it , the human reality .
What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence ?
We mean that man first of all exists , encounters himself , surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards .
If man as the existentialist sees him is not definable , it is because to begin with he is nothing .
He will not be anything until later , and then he will be what he makes of himself .
Thus , there is no human nature , because there is no God to have a conception of it .
Man simply is .
Not that he is simply what he conceives himself to be , but he is what he wills , and as he conceives himself after already existing – as he wills to be after that leap towards existence .
Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself .
That is the first principle of existentialism .
And this is what people call its “ subjectivity , ” using the word as a reproach against us .
But what do we mean to say by this , but that man is of a greater dignity than a stone or a table ?
For we mean to say that man primarily exists – that man is , before all else , something which propels itself towards a future and is aware that it is doing so .
Man is , indeed , a project which possesses a subjective life , instead of being a kind of moss , or a fungus or a cauliflower .
Before that projection of the self nothing exists ; not even in the heaven of intelligence : man will only attain existence when he is what he purposes to be .
Not , however , what he may wish to be .
For what we usually understand by wishing or willing is a conscious decision taken – much more often than not – after we have made ourselves what we are .
I may wish to join a party , to write a book or to marry – but in such a case what is usually called my will is probably a manifestation of a prior and more spontaneous decision .
If , however , it is true that existence is prior to essence , man is responsible for what he is .
Thus , the first effect of existentialism is that it puts every man in possession of himself as he is , and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his own shoulders .
And , when we say that man is responsible for himself , we do not mean that he is responsible only for his own individuality , but that he is responsible for all men .
The word “ subjectivism ” is to be understood in two senses , and our adversaries play upon only one of them .
Subjectivism means , on the one hand , the freedom of the individual subject and , on the other , that man cannot pass beyond human subjectivity .
It is the latter which is the deeper meaning of existentialism .
When we say that man chooses himself , we do mean that every one of us must choose himself ; but by that we also mean that in choosing for himself he chooses for all men .
For in effect , of all the actions a man may take in order to create himself as he wills to be , there is not one which is not creative , at the same time , of an image of man such as he believes he ought to be .
To choose between this or that is at the same time to affirm the value of that which is chosen ; for we are unable ever to choose the worse .
What we choose is always the better ; and nothing can be better for us unless it is better for all .
If , moreover , existence precedes essence and we will to exist at the same time as we fashion our image , that image is valid for all and for the entire epoch in which we find ourselves .
Our responsibility is thus much greater than we had supposed , for it concerns mankind as a whole .
If I am a worker , for instance , I may choose to join a Christian rather than a Communist trade union .
And if , by that membership , I choose to signify that resignation is , after all , the attitude that best becomes a man , that man ’s kingdom is not upon this earth , I do not commit myself alone to that view .
Resignation is my will for everyone , and my action is , in consequence , a commitment on behalf of all mankind .
Or if , to take a more personal case , I decide to marry and to have children , even though this decision proceeds simply from my situation , from my passion or my desire , I am thereby committing not only myself , but humanity as a whole , to the practice of monogamy .
I am thus responsible for myself and for all men , and I am creating a certain image of man as I would have him to be .
In fashioning myself I fashion man .
This may enable us to understand what is meant by such terms – perhaps a little grandiloquent – as anguish , abandonment and despair .
As you will soon see , it is very simple .
First , what do we mean by anguish ?
–
The existentialist frankly states that man is in anguish .
His meaning is as follows :
When a man commits himself to anything , fully realising that he is not only choosing what he will be , but is thereby at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind – in such a moment a man cannot escape from the sense of complete and profound responsibility .
There are many , indeed , who show no such anxiety .
But we affirm that they are merely disguising their anguish or are in flight from it .
Certainly , many people think that in what they are doing they commit no one but themselves to anything : and if you ask them , “ What would happen if everyone did so ? ” they shrug their shoulders and reply , “ Everyone does not do so . ”
But in truth , one ought always to ask oneself what would happen if everyone did as one is doing ; nor can one escape from that disturbing thought except by a kind of self - deception .
The man who lies in self - excuse , by saying “ Everyone will not do it ” must be ill at ease in his conscience , for the act of lying implies the universal value which it denies .
By its very disguise his anguish reveals itself .
This is the anguish that Kierkegaard called “ the anguish of Abraham . ”
You know the story :
An angel commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son ; and obedience was obligatory , if it really was an angel who had appeared and said , “ Thou , Abraham , shalt sacrifice thy son . ”
But anyone in such a case would wonder , first , whether it was indeed an angel and secondly , whether I am really Abraham .
Where are the proofs ?
A certain mad woman who suffered from hallucinations said that people were telephoning to her , and giving her orders .
The doctor asked , “ But who is it that speaks to you ? ”
She replied : “ He says it is God . ”
And what , indeed , could prove to her that it was God ?
If an angel appears to me , what is the proof that it is an angel ; or , if I hear voices , who can prove that they proceed from heaven and not from hell , or from my own subconsciousness or some pathological condition ?
Who can prove that they are really addressed to me ?
Who , then , can prove that I am the proper person to impose , by my own choice , my conception of man upon mankind ?
I shall never find any proof whatever ; there will be no sign to convince me of it .
If a voice speaks to me , it is still I myself who must decide whether the voice is or is not that of an angel .
If I regard a certain course of action as good , it is only I who choose to say that it is good and not bad .
There is nothing to show that I am Abraham : nevertheless I also am obliged at every instant to perform actions which are examples .
Everything happens to every man as though the whole human race had its eyes fixed upon what he is doing and regulated its conduct accordingly .
So every man ought to say , “ Am I really a man who has the right to act in such a manner that humanity regulates itself by what I do . ”
If a man does not say that , he is dissembling his anguish .
Clearly , the anguish with which we are concerned here is not one that could lead to quietism or inaction .
It is anguish pure and simple , of the kind well known to all those who have borne responsibilities .
When , for instance , a military leader takes upon himself the responsibility for an attack and sends a number of men to their death , he chooses to do it and at bottom he alone chooses .
No doubt under a higher command , but its orders , which are more general , require interpretation by him and upon that interpretation depends the life of ten , fourteen or twenty men .
In making the decision , he cannot but feel a certain anguish .
All leaders know that anguish .
It does not prevent their acting , on the contrary it is the very condition of their action , for the action presupposes that there is a plurality of possibilities , and in choosing one of these , they realize that it has value only because it is chosen .
Now it is anguish of that kind which existentialism describes , and moreover , as we shall see , makes explicit through direct responsibility towards other men who are concerned .
Far from being a screen which could separate us from action , it is a condition of action itself .
And when we speak of “ abandonment ” – a favorite word of Heidegger – we only mean to say that God does not exist , and that it is necessary to draw the consequences of his absence right to the end .
The existentialist is strongly opposed to a certain type of secular moralism which seeks to suppress God at the least possible expense .
Towards 1880 , when the French professors endeavoured to formulate a secular morality , they said something like this :
God is a useless and costly hypothesis , so we will do without it .
However , if we are to have morality , a society and a law - abiding world , it is essential that certain values should be taken seriously ; they must have an a priori existence ascribed to them .
It must be considered obligatory a priori to be honest , not to lie , not to beat one ’s wife , to bring up children and so forth ; so we are going to do a little work on this subject , which will enable us to show that these values exist all the same , inscribed in an intelligible heaven although , of course , there is no God .
In other words – and this is , I believe , the purport of all that we in France call radicalism – nothing will be changed if God does not exist ; we shall rediscover the same norms of honesty , progress and humanity , and we shall have disposed of God as an out - of - date hypothesis which will die away quietly of itself .
The existentialist , on the contrary , finds it extremely embarrassing that God does not exist , for there disappears with Him all possibility of finding values in an intelligible heaven .
There can no longer be any good a priori , since there is no infinite and perfect consciousness to think it .
It is nowhere written that “ the good ” exists , that one must be honest or must not lie , since we are now upon the plane where there are only men .
Dostoevsky once wrote : “ If God did not exist , everything would be permitted ” ; and that , for existentialism , is the starting point .
Everything is indeed permitted if God does not exist , and man is in consequence forlorn , for he cannot find anything to depend upon either within or outside himself .
He discovers forthwith , that he is without excuse .
For if indeed existence precedes essence , one will never be able to explain one ’s action by reference to a given and specific human nature ; in other words , there is no determinism – man is free , man is freedom .
Nor , on the other hand , if God does not exist , are we provided with any values or commands that could legitimise our behaviour .
Thus we have neither behind us , nor before us in a luminous realm of values , any means of justification or excuse .
–
We are left alone , without excuse .
That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free .
Condemned , because he did not create himself , yet is nevertheless at liberty , and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does .
The existentialist does not believe in the power of passion .
He will never regard a grand passion as a destructive torrent upon which a man is swept into certain actions as by fate , and which , therefore , is an excuse for them .
He thinks that man is responsible for his passion .
Neither will an existentialist think that a man can find help through some sign being vouchsafed upon earth for his orientation : for he thinks that the man himself interprets the sign as he chooses .
He thinks that every man , without any support or help whatever , is condemned at every instant to invent man .
As Ponge has written in a very fine article , “ Man is the future of man . ”
That is exactly true .
Only , if one took this to mean that the future is laid up in Heaven , that God knows what it is , it would be false , for then it would no longer even be a future .
If , however , it means that , whatever man may now appear to be , there is a future to be fashioned , a virgin future that awaits him – then it is a true saying .
But in the present one is forsaken .
As an example by which you may the better understand this state of abandonment , I will refer to the case of a pupil of mine , who sought me out in the following circumstances .
His father was quarrelling with his mother and was also inclined to be a “ collaborator ” ; his elder brother had been killed in the German offensive of 1940 and this young man , with a sentiment somewhat primitive but generous , burned to avenge him .
His mother was living alone with him , deeply afflicted by the semi-treason of his father and by the death of her eldest son , and her one consolation was in this young man .
But he , at this moment , had the choice between going to England to join the Free French Forces or of staying near his mother and helping her to live .
He fully realised that this woman lived only for him and that his disappearance – or perhaps his death – would plunge her into despair .
He also realised that , concretely and in fact , every action he performed on his mother ’s behalf would be sure of effect in the sense of aiding her to live , whereas anything he did in order to go and fight would be an ambiguous action which might vanish like water into sand and serve no purpose .
For instance , to set out for England he would have to wait indefinitely in a Spanish camp on the way through Spain ; or , on arriving in England or in Algiers he might be put into an office to fill up forms .
Consequently , he found himself confronted by two very different modes of action ; the one concrete , immediate , but directed towards only one individual ; and the other an action addressed to an end infinitely greater , a national collectivity , but for that very reason ambiguous – and it might be frustrated on the way .
At the same time , he was hesitating between two kinds of morality ; on the one side the morality of sympathy , of personal devotion and , on the other side , a morality of wider scope but of more debatable validity .
He had to choose between those two .
What could help him to choose ?
Could the Christian doctrine ?
No. Christian doctrine says :
Act with charity , love your neighbour , deny yourself for others , choose the way which is hardest , and so forth .
But which is the harder road ?
To whom does one owe the more brotherly love , the patriot or the mother ?
Which is the more useful aim , the general one of fighting in and for the whole community , or the precise aim of helping one particular person to live ?
Who can give an answer to that a priori ?
No one .
Nor is it given in any ethical scripture .
The Kantian ethic says , Never regard another as a means , but always as an end .
Very well ; if I remain with my mother , I shall be regarding her as the end and not as a means : but by the same token I am in danger of treating as means those who are fighting on my behalf ; and the converse is also true , that if I go to the aid of the combatants I shall be treating them as the end at the risk of treating my mother as a means .
If values are uncertain , if they are still too abstract to determine the particular , concrete case under consideration , nothing remains but to trust in our instincts .
That is what this young man tried to do ; and when I saw him he said , “ In the end , it is feeling that counts ; the direction in which it is really pushing me is the one I ought to choose .
If I feel that I love my mother enough to sacrifice everything else for her – my will to be avenged , all my longings for action and adventure then I stay with her .
If , on the contrary , I feel that my love for her is not enough , I go . ”
But how does one estimate the strength of a feeling ?
The value of his feeling for his mother was determined precisely by the fact that he was standing by her .
I may say that I love a certain friend enough to sacrifice such or such a sum of money for him , but I cannot prove that unless I have done it .
I may say , “ I love my mother enough to remain with her , ” if actually I have remained with her .
I can only estimate the strength of this affection if I have performed an action by which it is defined and ratified .
But if I then appeal to this affection to justify my action , I find myself drawn into a vicious circle .
Moreover , as Gide has very well said , a sentiment which is play - acting and one which is vital are two things that are hardly distinguishable one from another .
To decide that I love my mother by staying beside her , and to play a comedy the upshot of which is that I do so – these are nearly the same thing .
In other words , feeling is formed by the deeds that one does ; therefore I can not consult it as a guide to action .
And that is to say that I can neither seek within myself for an authentic impulse to action , nor can I expect , from some ethic , formulae that will enable me to act .
You may say that the youth did , at least , go to a professor to ask for advice .
But if you seek counsel – from a priest , for example you have selected that priest ; and at bottom you already knew , more or less , what he would advise .
In other words , to choose an adviser is nevertheless to commit oneself by that choice .
If you are a Christian , you will say , consult a priest ; but there are collaborationists , priests who are resisters and priests who wait for the tide to turn : which will you choose ?
Had this young man chosen a priest of the resistance , or one of the collaboration , he would have decided beforehand the kind of advice he was to receive .
Similarly , in coming to me , he knew what advice I should give him , and I had but one reply to make .
You are free , therefore choose , that is to say , invent .
No rule of general morality can show you what you ought to do : no signs are vouchsafed in this world .
The Catholics will reply , “ Oh , but they are ! ”
Very well ; still , it is I myself , in every case , who have to interpret the signs .
While I was imprisoned , I made the acquaintance of a somewhat remarkable man , a Jesuit , who had become a member of that order in the following manner .
In his life he had suffered a succession of rather severe setbacks .
His father had died when he was a child , leaving him in poverty , and he had been awarded a free scholarship in a religious institution , where he had been made continually to feel that he was accepted for charity ’s sake , and , in consequence , he had been denied several of those distinctions and honours which gratify children .
Later , about the age of eighteen , he came to grief in a sentimental affair ; and finally , at twenty - two – this was a trifle in itself , but it was the last drop that overflowed his cup – he failed in his military examination .
This young man , then , could regard himself as a total failure : it was a sign – but a sign of what ?
He might have taken refuge in bitterness or despair .
But he took it – very cleverly for him – as a sign that he was not intended for secular success , and that only the attainments of religion , those of sanctity and of faith , were accessible to him .
He interpreted his record as a message from God , and became a member of the Order .
Who can doubt but that this decision as to the meaning of the sign was his , and his alone ?
One could have drawn quite different conclusions from such a series of reverses – as , for example , that he had better become a carpenter or a revolutionary .
For the decipherment of the sign , however , he bears the entire responsibility .
That is what “ abandonment ” implies , that we ourselves decide our being .
And with this abandonment goes anguish .
As for “ despair , ” the meaning of this expression is extremely simple .
It merely means that we limit ourselves to a reliance upon that which is within our wills , or within the sum of the probabilities which render our action feasible .
Whenever one wills anything , there are always these elements of probability .
If I am counting upon a visit from a friend , who may be coming by train or by tram , I presuppose that the train will arrive at the appointed time , or that the tram will not be derailed .
I remain in the realm of possibilities ; but one does not rely upon any possibilities beyond those that are strictly concerned in one ’s action .
Beyond the point at which the possibilities under consideration cease to affect my action , I ought to disinterest myself .
For there is no God and no prevenient design , which can adapt the world and all its possibilities to my will .
When Descartes said , “ Conquer yourself rather than the world , ” what he meant was , at bottom , the same – that we should act without hope .
Marxists , to whom I have said this , have answered : “ Your action is limited , obviously , by your death ; but you can rely upon the help of others .
That is , you can count both upon what the others are doing to help you elsewhere , as in China and in Russia , and upon what they will do later , after your death , to take up your action and carry it forward to its final accomplishment which will be the revolution .
Moreover you must rely upon this ; not to do so is immoral . ”
To this I rejoin , first , that I shall always count upon my comrades - in - arms in the struggle , in so far as they are committed , as I am , to a definite , common cause ; and in the unity of a party or a group which I can more or less control – that is , in which I am enrolled as a militant and whose movements at every moment are known to me .
In that respect , to rely upon the unity and the will of the party is exactly like my reckoning that the train will run to time or that the tram will not be derailed .
But I can not count upon men whom I do not know , I can not base my confidence upon human goodness or upon man ’s interest in the good of society , seeing that man is free and that there is no human nature which I can take as foundational .
I do not know where the Russian revolution will lead .
I can admire it and take it as an example in so far as it is evident , today , that the proletariat plays a part in Russia which it has attained in no other nation .
But I cannot affirm that this will necessarily lead to the triumph of the proletariat : I must confine myself to what I can see .
Nor can I be sure that comrades - in - arms will take up my work after my death and carry it to the maximum perfection , seeing that those men are free agents and will freely decide , tomorrow , what man is then to be .
Tomorrow , after my death , some men may decide to establish Fascism , and the others may be so cowardly or so slack as to let them do so .
If so , Fascism will then be the truth of man , and so much the worse for us .
In reality , things will be such as men have decided they shall be .
Does that mean that I should abandon myself to quietism ?
No .
First I ought to commit myself and then act my commitment , according to the time - honoured formula that “ one need not hope in order to undertake one ’s work . ”
Nor does this mean that I should not belong to a party , but only that I should be without illusion and that I should do what I can .
For instance , if I ask myself “ Will the social ideal as such , ever become a reality ? ” I cannot tell , I only know that whatever may be in my power to make it so , I shall do ; beyond that , I can count upon nothing .
Quietism is the attitude of people who say , “ let others do what I cannot do . ”
The doctrine I am presenting before you is precisely the opposite of this , since it declares that there is no reality except in action .
It goes further , indeed , and adds , “ Man is nothing else but what he purposes , he exists only in so far as he realises himself , he is therefore nothing else but the sum of his actions , nothing else but what his life is . ”
Hence we can well understand why some people are horrified by our teaching .
For many have but one resource to sustain them in their misery , and that is to think , “ Circumstances have been against me , I was worthy to be something much better than I have been .
I admit I have never had a great love or a great friendship ; but that is because I never met a man or a woman who were worthy of it ; if I have not written any very good books , it is because I had not the leisure to do so ; or , if I have had no children to whom I could devote myself it is because I did not find the man I could have lived with .
So there remains within me a wide range of abilities , inclinations and potentialities , unused but perfectly viable , which endow me with a worthiness that could never be inferred from the mere history of my actions . ”
But in reality and for the existentialist , there is no love apart from the deeds of love ; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving ; there is no genius other than that which is expressed in works of art .
The genius of Proust is the totality of the works of Proust ; the genius of Racine is the series of his tragedies , outside of which there is nothing .
Why should we attribute to Racine the capacity to write yet another tragedy when that is precisely what he did not write ?
In life , a man commits himself , draws his own portrait and there is nothing but that portrait .
No doubt this thought may seem comfortless to one who has not made a success of his life .
On the other hand , it puts everyone in a position to understand that reality alone is reliable ; that dreams , expectations and hopes serve to define a man only as deceptive dreams , abortive hopes , expectations unfulfilled ; that is to say , they define him negatively , not positively .
Nevertheless , when one says , “ You are nothing else but what you live , ” it does not imply that an artist is to be judged solely by his works of art , for a thousand other things contribute no less to his definition as a man .
What we mean to say is that a man is no other than a series of undertakings , that he is the sum , the organisation , the set of relations that constitute these undertakings .
In the light of all this , what people reproach us with is not , after all , our pessimism , but the sternness of our optimism .
If people condemn our works of fiction , in which we describe characters that are base , weak , cowardly and sometimes even frankly evil , it is not only because those characters are base , weak , cowardly or evil .
For suppose that , like Zola , we showed that the behaviour of these characters was caused by their heredity , or by the action of their environment upon them , or by determining factors , psychic or organic .
People would be reassured , they would say , “ You see , that is what we are like , no one can do anything about it . ”
But the existentialist , when he portrays a coward , shows him as responsible for his cowardice .
He is not like that on account of a cowardly heart or lungs or cerebrum , he has not become like that through his physiological organism ; he is like that because he has made himself into a coward by actions .
There is no such thing as a cowardly temperament .
There are nervous temperaments ; there is what is called impoverished blood , and there are also rich temperaments .
But the man whose blood is poor is not a coward for all that , for what produces cowardice is the act of giving up or giving way ; and a temperament is not an action .
A coward is defined by the deed that he has done .
What people feel obscurely , and with horror , is that the coward as we present him is guilty of being a coward .
What people would prefer would be to be born either a coward or a hero .
One of the charges most often laid against the Chemins de la Liberté is something like this : “ But , after all , these people being so base , how can you make them into heroes ? ”
That objection is really rather comic , for it implies that people are born heroes : and that is , at bottom , what such people would like to think .
If you are born cowards , you can be quite content , you can do nothing about it and you will be cowards all your lives whatever you do ; and if you are born heroes you can again be quite content ; you will be heroes all your lives eating and drinking heroically .
Whereas the existentialist says that the coward makes himself cowardly , the hero makes himself heroic ; and that there is always a possibility for the coward to give up cowardice and for the hero to stop being a hero .
What counts is the total commitment , and it is not by a particular case or particular action that you are committed altogether .
We have now , I think , dealt with a certain number of the reproaches against existentialism .
You have seen that it cannot be regarded as a philosophy of quietism since it defines man by his action ; nor as a pessimistic description of man , for no doctrine is more optimistic , the destiny of man is placed within himself .
Nor is it an attempt to discourage man from action since it tells him that there is no hope except in his action , and that the one thing which permits him to have life is the deed .
Upon this level therefore , what we are considering is an ethic of action and self - commitment .
However , we are still reproached , upon these few data , for confining man within his individual subjectivity .
There again people badly misunderstand us .
Our point of departure is , indeed , the subjectivity of the individual , and that for strictly philosophic reasons .
It is not because we are bourgeois , but because we seek to base our teaching upon the truth , and not upon a collection of fine theories , full of hope but lacking real foundations .
And at the point of departure there cannot be any other truth than this , I think , therefore I am , which is the absolute truth of consciousness as it attains to itself .
Every theory which begins with man , outside of this moment of self - attainment , is a theory which thereby suppresses the truth , for outside of the Cartesian cogito , all objects are no more than probable , and any doctrine of probabilities which is not attached to a truth will crumble into nothing .
In order to define the probable one must possess the true .
Before there can be any truth whatever , then , there must be an absolute truth , and there is such a truth which is simple , easily attained and within the reach of everybody ; it consists in one ’s immediate sense of one ’s self .
In the second place , this theory alone is compatible with the dignity of man , it is the only one which does not make man into an object .
All kinds of materialism lead one to treat every man including oneself as an object – that is , as a set of pre-determined reactions , in no way different from the patterns of qualities and phenomena which constitute a table , or a chair or a stone .
Our aim is precisely to establish the human kingdom as a pattern of values in distinction from the material world .
But the subjectivity which we thus postulate as the standard of truth is no narrowly individual subjectivism , for as we have demonstrated , it is not only one ’s own self that one discovers in the cogito , but those of others too .
Contrary to the philosophy of Descartes , contrary to that of Kant , when we say “ I think ” we are attaining to ourselves in the presence of the other , and we are just as certain of the other as we are of ourselves .
Thus the man who discovers himself directly in the cogito also discovers all the others , and discovers them as the condition of his own existence .
He recognises that he cannot be anything ( in the sense in which one says one is spiritual , or that one is wicked or jealous ) unless others recognise him as such .
I cannot obtain any truth whatsoever about myself , except through the mediation of another .
The other is indispensable to my existence , and equally so to any knowledge I can have of myself .
Under these conditions , the intimate discovery of myself is at the same time the revelation of the other as a freedom which confronts mine , and which cannot think or will without doing so either for or against me .
Thus , at once , we find ourselves in a world which is , let us say , that of “ inter - subjectivity ” .
It is in this world that man has to decide what he is and what others are .
Furthermore , although it is impossible to find in each and every man a universal essence that can be called human nature , there is nevertheless a human universality of condition .
It is not by chance that the thinkers of today are so much more ready to speak of the condition than of the nature of man .
By his condition they understand , with more or less clarity , all the limitations which a priori define man ’s fundamental situation in the universe .
His historical situations are variable : man may be born a slave in a pagan society or may be a feudal baron , or a proletarian .
But what never vary are the necessities of being in the world , of having to labor and to die there .
These limitations are neither subjective nor objective , or rather there is both a subjective and an objective aspect of them .
Objective , because we meet with them everywhere and they are everywhere recognisable : and subjective because they are lived and are nothing if man does not live them – if , that is to say , he does not freely determine himself and his existence in relation to them .
And , diverse though man ’s purpose may be , at least none of them is wholly foreign to me , since every human purpose presents itself as an attempt either to surpass these limitations , or to widen them , or else to deny or to accommodate oneself to them .
Consequently every purpose , however individual it may be , is of universal value .
Every purpose , even that of a Chinese , an Indian or a Negro , can be understood by a European .
To say it can be understood , means that the European of 1945 may be striving out of a certain situation towards the same limitations in the same way , and that he may reconceive in himself the purpose of the Chinese , of the Indian or the African .
In every purpose there is universality , in this sense that every purpose is comprehensible to every man .
Not that this or that purpose defines man for ever , but that it may be entertained again and again .
There is always some way of understanding an idiot , a child , a primitive man or a foreigner if one has sufficient information .
In this sense we may say that there is a human universality , but it is not something given ; it is being perpetually made .
I make this universality in choosing myself ; I also make it by understanding the purpose of any other man , of whatever epoch .
This absoluteness of the act of choice does not alter the relativity of each epoch .
What is at the very heart and center of existentialism , is the absolute character of the free commitment , by which every man realises himself in realising a type of humanity – a commitment always understandable , to no matter whom in no matter what epoch – and its bearing upon the relativity of the cultural pattern which may result from such absolute commitment .
One must observe equally the relativity of Cartesianism and the absolute character of the Cartesian commitment .
In this sense you may say , if you like , that every one of us makes the absolute by breathing , by eating , by sleeping or by behaving in any fashion whatsoever .
There is no difference between free being – being as self - committal , as existence choosing its essence – and absolute being .
And there is no difference whatever between being as an absolute , temporarily localised that is , localised in history – and universally intelligible being .
This does not completely refute the charge of subjectivism .
Indeed that objection appears in several other forms , of which the first is as follows .
People say to us , “ Then it does not matter what you do , ” and they say this in various ways .
First they tax us with anarchy ; then they say , “ You cannot judge others , for there is no reason for preferring one purpose to another ” ; finally , they may say , “ Everything being merely voluntary in this choice of yours , you give away with one hand what you pretend to gain with the other . ”
These three are not very serious objections .
As to the first , to say that it does not matter what you choose is not correct .
In one sense choice is possible , but what is not possible is not to choose .
I can always choose , but I must know that if I do not choose , that is still a choice .
This , although it may appear merely formal , is of great importance as a limit to fantasy and caprice .
For , when I confront a real situation – for example , that I am a sexual being , able to have relations with a being of the other sex and able to have children – I am obliged to choose my attitude to it , and in every respect I bear the responsibility of the choice which , in committing myself , also commits the whole of humanity .
Even if my choice is determined by no a priori value whatever , it can have nothing to do with caprice : and if anyone thinks that this is only Gide ’s theory of the acte gratuit over again , he has failed to see the enormous difference between this theory and that of Gide .
Gide does not know what a situation is , his “ act ” is one of pure caprice .
In our view , on the contrary , man finds himself in an organised situation in which he is himself involved : his choice involves mankind in its entirety , and he cannot avoid choosing .
Either he must remain single , or he must marry without having children , or he must marry and have children .
In any case , and whichever he may choose , it is impossible for him , in respect of this situation , not to take complete responsibility .
Doubtless he chooses without reference to any pre-established value , but it is unjust to tax him with caprice .
Rather let us say that the moral choice is comparable to the construction of a work of art .
But here I must at once digress to make it quite clear that we are not propounding an aesthetic morality , for our adversaries are disingenuous enough to reproach us even with that .
I mention the work of art only by way of comparison .
That being understood , does anyone reproach an artist , when he paints a picture , for not following rules established a priori .
Does one ever ask what is the picture that he ought to paint ?
As everyone knows , there is no pre-defined picture for him to make ; the artist applies himself to the composition of a picture , and the picture that ought to be made is precisely that which he will have made .
As everyone knows , there are no aesthetic values a priori , but there are values which will appear in due course in the coherence of the picture , in the relation between the will to create and the finished work .
No one can tell what the painting of tomorrow will be like ; one cannot judge a painting until it is done .
What has that to do with morality ?
We are in the same creative situation .
We never speak of a work of art as irresponsible ; when we are discussing a canvas by Picasso , we understand very well that the composition became what it is at the time when he was painting it , and that his works are part and parcel of his entire life .
It is the same upon the plane of morality .
There is this in common between art and morality , that in both we have to do with creation and invention .
We cannot decide a priori what it is that should be done .
I think it was made sufficiently clear to you in the case of that student who came to see me , that to whatever ethical system he might appeal , the Kantian or any other , he could find no sort of guidance whatever ; he was obliged to invent the law for himself .
Certainly we cannot say that this man , in choosing to remain with his mother – that is , in taking sentiment , personal devotion and concrete charity as his moral foundations – would be making an irresponsible choice , nor could we do so if he preferred the sacrifice of going away to England .
Man makes himself ; he is not found ready - made ; he makes himself by the choice of his morality , and he cannot but choose a morality , such is the pressure of circumstances upon him .
We define man only in relation to his commitments ; it is therefore absurd to reproach us for irresponsibility in our choice .
In the second place , people say to us , “ You are unable to judge others . ”
This is true in one sense and false in another .
It is true in this sense , that whenever a man chooses his purpose and his commitment in all clearness and in all sincerity , whatever that purpose may be , it is impossible for him to prefer another .
It is true in the sense that we do not believe in progress .
Progress implies amelioration ; but man is always the same , facing a situation which is always changing , and choice remains always a choice in the situation .
The moral problem has not changed since the time when it was a choice between slavery and anti-slavery – from the time of the war of Secession , for example , until the present moment when one chooses between the M.R.P. [ Mouvement Republicain Poputaire ] and the Communists .
We can judge , nevertheless , for , as I have said , one chooses in view of others , and in view of others one chooses himself .
One can judge , first – and perhaps this is not a judgment of value , but it is a logical judgment – that in certain cases choice is founded upon an error , and in others upon the truth .
One can judge a man by saying that he deceives himself .
Since we have defined the situation of man as one of free choice , without excuse and without help , any man who takes refuge behind the excuse of his passions , or by inventing some deterministic doctrine , is a self - deceiver .
One may object : “ But why should he not choose to deceive himself ? ” I reply that it is not for me to judge him morally , but I define his self - deception as an error .
Here one cannot avoid pronouncing a judgment of truth .
The self - deception is evidently a falsehood , because it is a dissimulation of man ’s complete liberty of commitment .
Upon this same level , I say that it is also a self - deception if I choose to declare that certain values are incumbent upon me ; I am in contradiction with myself if I will these values and at the same time say that they impose themselves upon me .
If anyone says to me , “ And what if I wish to deceive myself ? ” I answer , “ There is no reason why you should not , but I declare that you are doing so , and that the attitude of strict consistency alone is that of good faith . ”
Furthermore , I can pronounce a moral judgment .
For I declare that freedom , in respect of concrete circumstances , can have no other end and aim but itself ; and when once a man has seen that values depend upon himself , in that state of forsakenness he can will only one thing , and that is freedom as the foundation of all values .
That does not mean that he wills it in the abstract : it simply means that the actions of men of good faith have , as their ultimate significance , the quest of freedom itself as such .
A man who belongs to some communist or revolutionary society wills certain concrete ends , which imply the will to freedom , but that freedom is willed in community .
We will freedom for freedom ’s sake , in and through particular circumstances .
And in thus willing freedom , we discover that it depends entirely upon the freedom of others and that the freedom of others depends upon our own .
Obviously , freedom as the definition of a man does not depend upon others , but as soon as there is a commitment , I am obliged to will the liberty of others at the same time as my own .
I can not make liberty my aim unless I make that of others equally my aim .
Consequently , when I recognise , as entirely authentic , that man is a being whose existence precedes his essence , and that he is a free being who cannot , in any circumstances , but will his freedom , at the same time I realize that I can not not will the freedom of others .
Thus , in the name of that will to freedom which is implied in freedom itself , I can form judgments upon those who seek to hide from themselves the wholly voluntary nature of their existence and its complete freedom .
Those who hide from this total freedom , in a guise of solemnity or with deterministic excuses , I shall call cowards .
Others , who try to show that their existence is necessary , when it is merely an accident of the appearance of the human race on earth – I shall call scum .
But neither cowards nor scum can be identified except upon the plane of strict authenticity .
Thus , although the content of morality is variable , a certain form of this morality is universal .
Kant declared that freedom is a will both to itself and to the freedom of others .
Agreed : but he thinks that the formal and the universal suffice for the constitution of a morality .
We think , on the contrary , that principles that are too abstract break down when we come to defining action .
To take once again the case of that student ; by what authority , in the name of what golden rule of morality , do you think he could have decided , in perfect peace of mind , either to abandon his mother or to remain with her ?
There are no means of judging .
The content is always concrete , and therefore unpredictable ; it has always to be invented .
The one thing that counts , is to know whether the invention is made in the name of freedom .
Let us , for example , examine the two following cases , and you will see how far they are similar in spite of their difference .
Let us take The Mill on the Floss .
We find here a certain young woman , Maggie Tulliver , who is an incarnation of the value of passion and is aware of it .
She is in love with a young man , Stephen , who is engaged to another , an insignificant young woman .
This Maggie Tulliver , instead of heedlessly seeking her own happiness , chooses in the name of human solidarity to sacrifice herself and to give up the man she loves .
On the other hand , La Sanseverina in Stendhal ’s Chartreuse de Parme , believing that it is passion which endows man with his real value , would have declared that a grand passion justifies its sacrifices , and must be preferred to the banality of such conjugal love as would unite Stephen to the little goose he was engaged to marry .
It is the latter that she would have chosen to sacrifice in realising her own happiness , and , as Stendhal shows , she would also sacrifice herself upon the plane of passion if life made that demand upon her .
Here we are facing two clearly opposed moralities ; but I claim that they are equivalent , seeing that in both cases the overruling aim is freedom .
You can imagine two attitudes exactly similar in effect , in that one girl might prefer , in resignation , to give up her lover while the other preferred , in fulfilment of sexual desire , to ignore the prior engagement of the man she loved ; and , externally , these two cases might appear the same as the two we have just cited , while being in fact entirely different .
The attitude of La Sanseverina is much nearer to that of Maggie Tulliver than to one of careless greed .
Thus , you see , the second objection is at once true and false .
One can choose anything , but only if it is upon the plane of free commitment .
The third objection , stated by saying , “ You take with one hand what you give with the other , ” means , at bottom , “ your values are not serious , since you choose them yourselves . ”
To that I can only say that I am very sorry that it should be so ; but if I have excluded God the Father , there must be somebody to invent values .
We have to take things as they are .
And moreover , to say that we invent values means neither more nor less than this ; that there is no sense in life a priori .
Life is nothing until it is lived ; but it is yours to make sense of , and the value of it is nothing else but the sense that you choose .
Therefore , you can see that there is a possibility of creating a human community .
I have been reproached for suggesting that existentialism is a form of humanism : people have said to me , “ But you have written in your Nausée that the humanists are wrong , you have even ridiculed a certain type of humanism , why do you now go back upon that ? ”
In reality , the word humanism has two very different meanings .
One may understand by humanism a theory which upholds man as the end - in - itself and as the supreme value .
Humanism in this sense appears , for instance , in Cocteau ’s story Round the World in 80 Hours , in which one of the characters declares , because he is flying over mountains in an airplane , “ Man is magnificent ! ”
This signifies that although I personally have not built aeroplanes , I have the benefit of those particular inventions and that I personally , being a man , can consider myself responsible for , and honoured by , achievements that are peculiar to some men .
It is to assume that we can ascribe value to man according to the most distinguished deeds of certain men .
That kind of humanism is absurd , for only the dog or the horse would be in a position to pronounce a general judgment upon man and declare that he is magnificent , which they have never been such fools as to do – at least , not as far as I know .
But neither is it admissible that a man should pronounce judgment upon Man .
Existentialism dispenses with any judgment of this sort : an existentialist will never take man as the end , since man is still to be determined .
And we have no right to believe that humanity is something to which we could set up a cult , after the manner of Auguste Comte .
The cult of humanity ends in Comtian humanism , shut - in upon itself , and – this must be said – in Fascism .
We do not want a humanism like that .
But there is another sense of the word , of which the fundamental meaning is this :
Man is all the time outside of himself : it is in projecting and losing himself beyond himself that he makes man to exist ; and , on the other hand , it is by pursuing transcendent aims that he himself is able to exist .
Since man is thus self - surpassing , and can grasp objects only in relation to his self - surpassing , he is himself the heart and center of his transcendence .
There is no other universe except the human universe , the universe of human subjectivity .
This relation of transcendence as constitutive of man ( not in the sense that God is transcendent , but in the sense of self - surpassing ) with subjectivity ( in such a sense that man is not shut up in himself but forever present in a human universe ) – it is this that we call existential humanism .
This is humanism , because we remind man that there is no legislator but himself ; that he himself , thus abandoned , must decide for himself ; also because we show that it is not by turning back upon himself , but always by seeking , beyond himself , an aim which is one of liberation or of some particular realisation , that man can realize himself as truly human .
You can see from these few reflections that nothing could be more unjust than the objections people raise against us .
Existentialism is nothing else but an attempt to draw the full conclusions from a consistently atheistic position .
Its intention is not in the least that of plunging men into despair .
And if by despair one means as the Christians do – any attitude of unbelief , the despair of the existentialists is something different .
Existentialism is not atheist in the sense that it would exhaust itself in demonstrations of the non-existence of God .
It declares , rather , that even if God existed that would make no difference from its point of view .
Not that we believe God does exist , but we think that the real problem is not that of His existence ; what man needs is to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself , not even a valid proof of the existence of God .
In this sense existentialism is optimistic .
It is a doctrine of action , and it is only by self - deception , by confining their own despair with ours that Christians can describe us as without hope .

私が大学生だったはるか前世紀の昔に何かで読んだことを最近思い出した。イギリスの歴史家が言うには、産業革命の初期における重要なテクノロジーはジンだったと いうのだ。
田舎の生活から都市生活への移行があまりに急で苦痛なものだったため、社会にできることといえば一世代に渡り酔っぱらって朦朧としていることくらいだった。当時の話にはびっくりするようなものがある。ロンドンの通りで
は手押し車にジンを載せて売り歩いていたという。
今日のような産業革命に対応した組織構造を持つに至ったのは、社会が集団的飲んだくれ状態から目覚めた後のことだ。公共の図書館や美術館、子供たちに広範に行われる教育、選挙で選ばれた代表、そういったことの多くは、人々が危機のようであることを止めて資産のようになるまで生じなかったのだ。
私たちが今日工業化社会と考えているものが現れ始めたのは、人々がこの大きな市民の余剰を、ただ浪費すべきものではなく目的とすべきものとして捉えるようになってからのことだ。
20世紀の重要なテクノロジーで、それがなければ社会の歯車が狂ってしまう潤滑油となっているものが何だったかと問われれば、私はテレビドラマがそうだと答える。第二次世界大戦とともに一連のことが起こった。一人あたりのGDPが上がり、教育レベルが上がり、平均寿命が延び、週5日働く人が増えた。ここにおいて初めて、社会は膨大な数の市民に対し、以前は管理する必要のなかったものを管理することを強いるようになった。余暇の時間だ。
それで私たちはその余暇の時間で何をしたのだろうか?
ほとんどはテレビを見るのに費やされた。
私たちはそれを何十年も続けた。私たちは「アイ・ラブ・ルーシー」を見た。「ギリガン君SOS」を見た。「マルコム・イン・ザ・ミドル」を見た。「デスパレートな妻たち」を見た。「デスパレートな妻たち」は認知的ヒートシンクとして機能した。積み重なって社会を過熱状態にするような考えを追い散らしたのだ。
集団的酔っぱらい状態から目覚め、思考の余剰を危機ではなく資産として見るようになったのはほんの最近のことだ。私たちはこの余剰のアドバンテージを利用すべくデザインされたものを目にするようになった。単にみんなの部屋にテレビがあるというのよりも、もっと深く関わって思考を 引き出せるものをだ。
これは2ヶ月ほど前にした会話を思い起こさせる。ジェンが紹介してくれたように、私は最近Here Comes Everybodyという本を出したが、その本について話していたときにこの認識が出てきたのだ。あるテレビプロデューサーが彼らの番組に出すか判断するために私をインタビューして、その中で彼女は「どんな興味深いことが起きているのでしょうか?」と質問をした。
私はWikipediaの冥王星の項目の話をした。冥王星が2年ほど前に惑星クラブから追い出されたのは覚えているだろう。その時にWikipediaでは活発な活動が起きた。議論のページが賑やかになり、みんな競うように冥王星の項目を編集し、「冥王星のステータスの変更をいったいどう書いたらいいだろう?」ということでコミュニティ全体が大騒ぎのようになった。そうしてしばらくの間舞台裏で論争が続いて、この項目は「冥王星は9番目の惑星である」というものから「冥王星は太陽系の外縁にある奇妙な形をした奇妙な軌道を描く岩である」というものまでの間を揺れ動いていた。
そういったことを説明して、 「この後は権威とか社会的構造なんかの話になるのかな」と思っていた。しかし彼女の質問はそういうものではなかった。彼女は今の話を聞くと、頭を横に振りながら、「その人たちはみんなどうやって時間を見つけているんでしょう?」と言った。それが彼女の疑問だったのだ。それで言ってやった。「テレビで働く人は誰もその質問をしませんね。その時間がどこから来るのかはご存じでしょう。それはあなた方が50年間覆い隠してきた思考の余剰からくるのです」
では、この余剰はどれほどの大きさのものなのだろう?
Wikipediaを単位として考えてみよう。Wikipediaプロジェクトの全体、そのすべてのページ、すべて編集、すべての議論のページ、すべてのコード、すべての言語バージョンを合わせると、それは1億時間に上る人間の思考の集積になる。私はIBMのマーチン・ワッテンバーグといっしょにこの数字を出した。おおざっぱな計算だが、オーダーは合っていると思う。1億時間の思考だ。
ではテレビの視聴はどうだろう ?
こちらはアメリカだけで毎年2000億時間になる。いまやちょうどいい単位があるので、これを言い換えてみると、テレビを見ることに毎年2000
Wikipediaプロジェクトが費やされているのだ。もうちょっと違った言い方をすると、アメリカで毎週末にコマーシャルを見るのに費やされる時間は1億時間になる。これはすごく大きな余剰だ。Wikipediaのようなものを見て「どうやってそんな時間を見つけているの?」と聞く人は、この資産を少しばかり切り出して、ティム・オライリーが参加のアーキテクチャと呼ぶところのものへと引き込んだWikipediaプロジェクトの全体が、どれほど小さなものなのか理解していないのだ。
このような余剰について興味深いことは、はじめ社会はそれをどうすれば良いかわからないでいるということだ。それゆえのジンであり、それゆえのテレビドラマだ。人々が既存の社会的機構との関係においてこの余剰で何をすべきかわかっていたなら、それは余剰とは呼ばれないだろう。何かをどうやって活用すればいいのか誰もわからない時に、人々はそれで実験し始めなければならなくなる。余剰を統合し、その統合の過程で社会を変えていくことができるように。
この思考の余剰を利用しようとする初期の段階においては(私たちがいるのはまだこの段階だ)、すべてが特殊ケースだ。参加の力学は、重力の理論よりは天気の理論に似ている。あらゆる力が組み合わさって、こういったものを機能させているのだということはわかっている。興味深いコミュニティがこちらにあり、興味深い共有モデルがあちらにあり、向こうの人たちは共同してオープンソースソフトウェアを作っている。しかしインプットを知っていても、アウトプットがどうなるかを予測することはできない。あまりに複雑なためだ。
複雑な生態系を探索する方法はただひたすらたくさんのことを試みるということであり、失敗する人は情報を残して失敗し、あなたの行くところに目印になる骸骨のついた杖があることを期待するしかないのだ。私たちがいるのはそういう段階だ。
一つ例を出そう。私は好きだが、ごく小さなものだ。2、3週間前にITPの私の学生が、ブラジルのフォルタレザにいるバスコ・ファルタードという教授が始めたプロジェクトのことを知らせてくれた。それはブラジルで起きた犯罪のWiki Mapだった。暴行や、押し込みや、路上強盗や、盗難や、レイプや、殺人があると、Google Map上にプッシュピンを立てて暴行などと記入し、どこで犯罪が起きているのか地図の上でわかるようにするのだ。
そういったことは暗黙の情報としては存在している。町のことを知っている人はみんな、感覚的にわかっているものだ。「あそこは行かない方がいい。あの通り角は危ないよ。このあたりには近寄るな。暗くなったらあの辺は注意しなさい」。しかしそれは社会がそれと気付かずに知っていることであり、利用できる公的な情報源があるわけではない。そして警察は、その情報を持っていたとしても、間違いなく公開はしないだろう。実際、ファルタードはWiki犯罪マップを始める際にこう言っている。「この情報は社会のどこかにあるのかもしれないし、ないのかもしれない。しかし実際のところ、
一から構築する方が、それを持っているかもしれない当局から手に入れようとするよりも簡単だったのだ」。
これは成功するかもしれないし、失敗するかもしれない。ソーシャルソフトウェアはたいていは失敗するのだ。こういった実験の多くはいい結果にならない。しかしうまくいくものはめざましい結果を出す。私はこのプロジェクトには成功して欲しいと思う。しかしたとえ成功しなかったとしても、これはすでに肝心なことを示している。誰か一人で取り組んでいる人が、ごく安価なツールを使って、十分な思考の余剰、十分な参加欲求、十分な集合的市民の善意を取り出し、5年前であっても想像できなかったようなリソースを作り出せる希望があるということだ。
だからこれが、 「みんなどうやって時間を見つけているの?」という問に対する答えだ。あるいはさっきの数値的な答えがそうだ。しかしこの問の背後には別な思いがあって、これは問というよりは意見なのだ。同じテレビプロデューサーとの会話の中で、World of Warcraftのギルドについて話したとき、彼女の考えていることが何となくわかった。「負け犬たち。大の大人が部屋に籠もってエルフごっこしているなんて」
少なくとも彼らは何かをしている。
「 ギリガ ン 君SOS 」 を見たことはある ?
毎回登場人物たちは島を脱出しかけるのだけど、ギリガンが台無しにして、結局脱出できなくなる。私は見たことがある。子供の頃に随分見た。そうして番組を見ている30分は、ブログを書かず、Wikipediaを編集せず、メーリングリストに投稿しない30分だ。私にはそういったことをしない確固とした言い訳があった。当時そんなものはなかったのだ。私がメディアにチャンネルを押しつけられていたのは、それが唯一の選択肢だったからだ。今は違う。そして大きな余剰がある。部屋に籠もってエルフになったつもりになるのがどんなに惨めだろうと、私が個人的な体験から確かに言えるのは、部屋に籠もってジンジャーとメアリーアンのどっちがかわいいか見極めようとしている方がずっと惨めだということだ。
これは一般原則にできると思う。何かをするのは、何もしないよりはいいのだ。かわいい子猫の写真にかわいらしいキャプションをつけていっそうかわいらしくしたlolcatだって、参加を促している。lolcatは「素敵なサンセリフフォントがあるなら、あなたにもこのゲームができるよ」と言っている。そしてこのメッセージ、「僕にもできるんだ」というのは大きな変化なのだ。
これはメディアの世界にいる人間が理解しないことだ。20世紀のメディアは一種類の競技だった。消費だ。我々はどれだけ作れるだろう?
君たちはどれだけ消費できる?
もっとたくさん作ったら君たちはもっと消費する?
この質問に対する答えは一般にイエスだった。しかしメディアというのは実際にはトライアスロンなのだ。別々な3つの競技がある。人々は消費するのが好きだが、作るのも好きだし、発信するのも好きだ。
この余剰を使って何か面白いことをしようという以前の古い社会構造にはまり込んでいる人たちを驚かせたのは、何かを作り公開する機会が提供されれば人々はそれを受け入れるということだった。これは私たちがもはや何も考えずにカウチで「スクラブス」を見はしなくなるということではない。ただそうすることが減るということだ。
思考の余剰の大きさについてもう少し考えてみよう。それはあまりにも大きいため、ほんの小さな変化でも大きな結果を生み出しうる。たとえば99%は変わらず、みんな今までと99%までは同じようにテレビを見るが、1%は何かを作り、公開することに使ったとしよう。インターネットにアクセスできる人々が1年にテレビを見る時間は、おおよそ1兆時間になる。アメリカにおける年間の消費時間の約5倍だ。その1パーセントは年間10,000のWikipediaプロジェクトへの貢献に相当する。
これはすごいことになるという気がするのだが、そうは思わないだろうか?
件のテレビプロデューサーはすごいことになるとは思わなかった。彼女にはこのような考え方が気に入らなかったのだ。彼女の最後の質問は、実質的には「これは単なる一時的なはやりではないの?」ということだった。21世紀の最初の最初に起きた高所立て籠もりみたいなものだ
というのだ。ちょっと何かを作って公開するのは楽しいけど、そのうち人々は「これは今までやっていたことほど良くはない」と気付いて、元の状態に落ち着くだろうというのだ。私は、これはそんなんじゃない、大きな不可逆な変化であって、高所立て籠もりよりは産業革命に近いものだと反論した。
これは社会が成長するとなくなる類のものではない。これは社会が成長すると至るところのものなのだ。しかし私は彼女が納得したかどうか自信がない。一つには彼女がそのようなことを信じたくないためだったが、私があまり説得力のある話を持ち合わせていなかったためでもある。今はその話を持っている。
一月くらい前に友人たちと食事をしたとき、一人が4歳の娘とDVDを見ていたときの話をした。映画の途中で、ふと彼女がカウチから飛び降りて、画面の後ろに回り込んだ。これは子供のするかわいらしい行動のように見える。彼女はきっとドーラがテレビの後ろに本当にいると思ったのだろう。しかし彼女がしていたのはそういうことではなかった。彼女はケーブルをたぐり始めた。父親が「何してるの?」と聞くと、彼女は画面の後ろから頭を出して、「マウスを探してるの」と答えた。
これは4歳児の知っていることなのだ。マウスなしで出荷される画面というのは壊れている。これは4歳児の知っていることなのだ。あなたをターゲットとしているがあなたに参加させないようなメディアは、黙って見ている価値がない。このことで、私はこの変化が一方向の変化なのだと確信した。現在の環境に最も強く依存している4歳の子供が、子供時代に見て過ごした「ギリガン君SOS」の記憶を消そうとするトラウマを体験する必要のない4歳児が、メディアは消費と作成と公開を含むものだと単純に仮定しているのだから。
これは私たちがやっていることについて人に聞かれたときに答えるモットーになっている。そして私が「私たち」という時には、この思考の余剰をどうやって役立てようかと探し求めている大きな社会を意味しているが、特にこの部屋にいる人たち、次のいいアイデアを見出そうとハンマーとやっとこを手に働いているみんなのことをも意味している。私の彼らに対する返事は「私たちはマウスを探しています」だ。読者やリスナーや視聴者やユーザが閉め出され、受け身だったり限定的だったりお仕着せの体験を強いられているあらゆる場所を探し、自分自身に問うことにしよう。「思考の余剰を少しばかり取り出してここに入れたなら、何かいいことが起きないだろうか? 」
私はイエスという答えに賭ける。
ご静聴どうもありがとう。
Inflation hits close to home
We are on the cusp of an economic crisis , one that I hope the Federal Reserve 's Open Market Committee considers when it votes on whether to cut interest rates again this week .
I 'm speaking , of course , about the rising price of Cool Ranch Doritos .
Frito - Lay , the maker of my favorite junk food , said last week it was raising prices , mostly on larger bags of snacks , because of higher prices for grain , cooking oil and energy .
It admitted it already cut back on the number of chips per bag ( I knew it ! ) .
So I say to Ben Bernanke and his Money Brigade : Enough is enough .
When economic policy infringes on the affordability of snack food , it 's time to change course .
Still , I 'm a professional .
I know that monetary policy should be determined by more than just one columnist 's cravings .
So I called Bob McTeer , the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a man who 's attended quite a few FOMC meetings .
When I reached him , he 'd just started on a slice of coconut cream pie .
No doubt he paid more for it than he would have a few months ago , but I did n't ask about his dessert .
We had meatier issues to discuss .
I talked to McTeer at length about Fed policy last August , before the first round of rate cuts , and I wanted to get his assessment eight months and six cuts later .
Interest rates are 3 percentage points lower than they were then , but it does n't seem to have helped our slumping economy .
" The Fed 's done a pretty good job of adding liquidity , but it's not been that effective so far , " McTeer said .
" Everybody 's afraid of everybody else . "
Lenders that a year ago would loan money on as little as a white lie are now afraid to loan even amongst themselves .
Rate cuts alone , though , wo n't restore rationality to the credit markets .
McTeer said he thinks the Fed may opt for a quarter - point cut in the Fed funds rate at its Wednesday meeting .
Central bank officials already have hinted that if there 's a cut , it may be the last one for a while .
Rate cuts can be effective economic stimulants , but repeated cuts have diminishing returns , McTeer said .
" A slight difference in the interest rate does n't seem to be all that important , " he said .
Instead , other Fed actions such as allowing investment banks to borrow from the discount window — a figurative term that refers to the discounted rate at which the Fed loans money to banks — seem to have helped more .
Delayed effect
McTeer said he thinks the Fed , while slow to act on the signs of a slowdown last summer , has responded well since then .
It takes a while to determine the economic impact of rate cuts .
" When policies work , people totally forget about them , " McTeer said .
" Two years from now , people will forget they averted a crisis and blame them for not fighting inflation . "
So the question for Wednesday 's meeting is whether the economy needs stimulus , or whether inflation — remember those Doritos — is now a bigger concern .
The Fed has no intricate machinery for tending
the economy .
Instead , it has " one big lever , " McTeer said , referring to interest rates .
" It 's got to make a choice between a major financial market crisis or being more diligent on inflation , " he said .
If it chooses the former , it cuts ; if it chooses the latter , it raises .
The European Central Bank last week raised rates amid concern of accelerating inflation .
The ECB , though , is charged only with keeping inflation in check , while the Fed is supposed to ensure the stability of our financial system .
Walking a tightrope
For the past eight months , as the mortgage crisis broadened into a full - scale credit crunch , the Fed has walked the tightrope between fighting a recession and fighting inflation .
It chose to battle the more immediate threat , recession , which probably was the right call .
That battle , though , comes at a price .
As rates have fallen , so has the value of the dollar .
The weaker dollar has contributed to rising prices for energy , food and metals .
California SUV drivers are paying $ 100 for fill - ups , and Wal - Mart is limiting the sale of rice at Sam's Club .
While the rising price of my beloved Cool Ranch Doritos may capture our — or at least my — attention , of course the concern is far broader .
Inflation is hitting essential grains , such as wheat and corn , and the effect already can be felt in the grocery aisles .
In other words , we can't wait to see if the Fed 's recession - fighting policy has worked .
It 's time to throw the lever the other way .

NEW YORK -- Roger Clemens is n't welcome on the U.S. Olympic baseball team .
U.S. general manager Bob Watson said Wednesday that he is n't considering the 45 - year - old right - hander for his roster for the Beijing Games .
" From my standpoint , we do n't need that type of distraction , " Watson said .
In addition to his duties as vice president of on - field operations for Major League Baseball , Watson is general manager of professional baseball operations for USA Baseball and works to select manager Davey Johnson 's roster .
A former GM of the Houston Astros and New York Yankees , Watson said he did n't anticipate being overruled by higher - ups .
" I have not talked to the commissioner .
I have not talked to [ MLB chief operating officer ]
Bob DuPuy , nor have I talked to his agent , but I just think the distraction that he 's carrying right now , from my standpoint , we do n't need that , " Watson said .
A seven - time Cy Young Award winner , Clemens was accused by his former trainer , Brian McNamee , of using performance - enhancing drugs in 1998 , 2000 and 2001 , before players and owners agreed to ban them .
Clemens repeatedly denied the accusations and filed a defamation suit against McNamee .
In November , a month before the Mitchell report was released , Clemens ' agent , Randy Hendricks , said pitching in the Olympics was " something to consider . "
Hendricks said he had discussed it in general terms with Clemens .
Clemens played for the U.S. team in the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006 .
He went 6 - 6 with a 4.18 ERA for the Yankees last season , and the 354 - game winner has n't said whether he wants to play in 2008 .
" The other thing , too you 've got to remember his last three or four outings , he had to take injections in his elbow .
He had to take injections in his groin area .
He was n't the healthiest guy on the team , " Watson said .
" So there 's some young guys who are throwing the ball well , and I think we could put together 12 pitchers , sadly to say , that would be throwing better than he was at the end of the year last year . "
At the U.S. Olympic team media summit last month , Watson was quoted as saying Clemens was n't " on my radar screen " because of his performance at the end of last season .
On Wednesday , however , Watson said " distraction " was an issue , too .
Last week , the Daily News reported Clemens had a decade - long relationship with country star Mindy McCready that began when she was 15 and an aspiring singer .
The newspaper also linked the seven - time Cy Young Award winner to former Manhattan bartender Angela Moyer and Paulette Dean Daly , a former wife of champion golfer John Daly .
Clemens apologized Monday for unspecified mistakes in his personal life and denied having an affair with a 15 - year - old .
Players not on 25 - man major league rosters are eligible for consideration for Olympic baseball teams .
Baseball was dropped for the 2012 London Games but is attempting to gain reinstatement for 2016 .
Hendricks did not return an e-mail seeking comment Wednesday .
Authorities say her husband , Darrell Roberson , fired the shot that killed Mr. LaSalle , 32 , outside the Robersons ' Arlington home .
Mr. Roberson had come home unexpectedly from a gambling trip to Dallas the night of Dec. 11 , 2006 , and found his wife and Mr. LaSalle together in Mr. LaSalle 's truck .
He started shooting as a horrified Mrs. Roberson began saying she was raped .
Arlington police charged Mr. Roberson with murder , and a detective testified that authorities never took out a warrant for Mrs. Roberson .
A bunch of people have passed on this story , about a woman who falsely told her husband she 's been raped when he caught her with another man , prompting him to immediately shoot and kill the other man . *
She was then convicted of manslaughter , while her husband was not charged at all .
What I find particularly intriguing about that result is that it suggests men are n't able to control their emotions — he could n't help but kill the guy when he thought he 'd raped his wife !— which is a rather interesting , ahem , commentary on men .
Simultaneously , it suggests that women should be able to control their emotions , and are to be punished when they do n't — because , ultimately , what we have is a woman who ( wrongly ) told a lie in desperation , and a man who ( wrongly ) killed another man in anger , but it is her rash lie that is punished , not his rashly pulling the trigger .
Four times .
Of course the argument is that he never would have pulled that trigger without her lie , but why does that mean he should be exempt from punishment ?
If she had been telling the truth , and he had killed an actual rapist , it 's still wrong .-----------------------*
That 's what we 're clearly meant to think , anyway , although something smells fishy to me :
That sounds to me more like he started shooting , and she started saying she was raped to try to save her own life — which would explain why , originally , he was charged and she was not .
I get the distinct impression that this story is not totally what it seems .
Fake Food : A Baby ’s Perspective
It is almost humorous when you see someone grab a piece of fake fruit or pastry and attempt to take a bite .
Some fake foods look and feel so real you can hardly tell them apart , until you try to sink your teeth in .
This poor kid just wants a nice afternoon snack , until he is completely fooled by this fake food display .
We just hope his mother was nice enough to give him a real snack afterwards .

A pop psychologist might say that Mrs. Clinton was showing symptoms of denial or of being divorced from reality , but she has said for months that she will not quit as long as there remains a mathematical possibility that she could capture the nomination .
That chance narrowed considerably Tuesday night , but the path is not totally blocked .
As a brief news conference after her remarks at the college , she said , “ It ’s a new day , it ’s a new state , it ’s a new election , ” her upbeat tone never wavering .
“ I ’m staying in this race until there ’s a nominee .
I ’m going to work as hard as I can to become that nominee . ”
Jay Carson , a campaign spokesman , said that he had spoken privately with Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday morning and that she was in a good mood .
“ We feel we did well last night , ” Mr. Carson said .
“ She is not someone who is buffeted by the day - to - day ups and downs of the campaign .
She is tough and tenacious .
That ’s why she ’s a phenomenal campaigner and why she ’d be a great president . ”
“ She ’s unflappable , ” he added .
“ She ’s proven that to you in the press and to the voters . ”
In her victory speech in Indianapolis on Tuesday night ( in which she also conceded North Carolina ) , Mrs. Clinton vowed to press on but sounded wistful at times about a long campaign that many believe will soon draw to an end .
She delivered an unusually long list of thank - yous , reminded Democrats that “ we are all on the same team ” and pledged to support the nominee  if she does not prevail .
But there was no sense of leave - taking Wednesday , as Mrs. Clinton began what she described in a fund - raising letter as the “ final 28 days of voting . ”
But her supporters sensed that more than a calendar page was turning .
Many said they felt that Mrs. Clinton ’s quest was coming to a close .
A major copyright infringement case against Chinese search engine Baidu is moving forward , as Beijing 's No.1 Intermediate People 's Court has agreed to hear claims brought forward by three of the Big Four record labels .
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry announced this morning that the three labels were seeking maximum damages of 500,000 yuan ( roughly US $ 71,000 ) per track on at least 127 tracks , totaling 63,500,000 yuan ( US$9 million ) in damages .
But that could just be the minimum , as the IFPI says Baidu may face damages in the billions .
The three music labels — Universal Music Ltd , Sony BMG Music Entertainment ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. , and Warner Music Hong Kong Ltd. — began legal proceedings against Baidu in February .
The move represents a second attempt to hold Baidu responsible for what the IFPI and the labels consider widespread support of piracy .
The labels say that Baidu is guilty of " deep - linking " to MP3s on servers throughout the country ( many of which are pirated ) directly from its web site , alleging that the search engine has become popular largely due to these links .
The first case against Baidu was thrown out in December , but the IFPI filed again after it won a similar case against Yahoo China .
Last year , Beijing 's Higher People 's Court ruled that Yahoo China was also liable for copyright infringement after it " deep - linked " a number of pirated MP3s .
The IFPI hopes that the new case against Baidu will be judged according to the same copyright laws that granted victory against Yahoo China .
The IFPI says that the $ 9 million in damages this time around is only the tip of the iceberg , as it claims that Baidu " participates in the infringement of more than a quarter of a million tracks . "
If the record companies seek maximum statutory damages on every single song , Baidu could be held liable for billions of dollars .
Of course , this is merely speculation on IFPI 's part , as the companies will need to index and identify those quarter of a million tracks in order to realize such damages .
Baidu is also being targeted by the Music Copyright Society of China for copyright infringement .
The group filed a lawsuit earlier this year for ( again ) deep - linking MP3 files , and seeks about 1 million yuan ( roughly US $ 140,000 ) for linking at least 50 songs .
" Baidu is not the only search engine involved in infringing music copyrights , but currently it is the largest , " Music Copyright Society of China director Qu Jingming said at the time .
" We can only ' capture the ringleader first in order to catch all the followers . ' "
IFPI CEO John Kennedy agrees .
" Baidu is China 's largest violator of music copyrights , generating huge revenue by deliberately providing access to illegal content , " he said in a statement today .
" The record industry wants partnership with China 's internet companies , but one that is based on respect of copyright and the law .
It is totally wrong that internet giants like Baidu should build a fortune by abusing the rights of artists , songwriters and record producers . "
Perhaps we 've been missing out .
While ISPs and web developers have long granted themselves god - like clauses allowing them to censor , block , throttle , or disconnect just about anyone for anything , we at Ars have yet to capitalize on the many powers we could grant ourselves by writing a contract that no one will ever read .
By being in the content business instead of the network business , we have sadly been unable to 1 ) disconnect anyone who ever badmouths the site , 2 ) send killer robots to the homes of those who block ads on the site , and 3 ) demand that the sweet stem cells of your firstborn be stockpiled in order to keep Editor - in - Chief Ken Fisher alive until the singularity comes .
Okay , so ISPs can't do all those things either , but as a group , they are no stranger to the Over - Broad Contract .
The AP took a recent look at the contracts of the ten largest US ISPs and — surprise !— they tend to be highly restrictive .
Most can be changed at any time without warning .
Users can be disconnected for just about anything .
Traffic can be blocked no matter if it is legal or not .
Users can be booted for criticizing the company .
Such provisions are buried in pages of text that can only charitably be described as " obfuscatory . "
No one ever reads them , not even the people who work for Consumers Union .
Bob Williams , a telecoms expert with the nonprofit , told the AP that he did n't look at his FiOS contract until it came in the mail ... after FiOS was installed and running .
" I really should have examined it better than I did , " he said .
If this man does n't read
his contracts , will you ?
If Bob Williams does n't read his contract , will your mom ?
Your brother ?
Will you ?
( Do you ? )
One solution to the problem might be to have regulators lay down certain ground rules so that consumers do n't have to wade through the fine print to know the basics of their service details .
The FCC may in fact get involved in just such exercise when it comes to setting bandwidth management ground rules in the current Comcast case .
Apart from that , though , there 's not really much that consumers can do ; few people are going to avoid signing up for FiOS because they 're worried about a contract term , and most people are caught like fish in the broadband duopoly net .
But so long as there is at least a modicum of real competition , even the largest companies remain sensitive to widespread customer outrage , so perhaps this is n't the big deal it appears to be .
We 've already seen a host of quick volte face maneuvers on the part of companies in recent months when confronted with egregious terms of service provisions .
When someone noticed that AT&T reserved the right to disconnect critics of the company , AT&T quickly changed the terms of service to remove the offending provision .
Google made a similar move when faced with criticism over its terms of service for Google Docs , and Adobe has just done the same with its PhotoShop Express web service .
It does n't always work , though .
Comcast changed its own terms of service in the wake of the uproar over its P2P " delaying " tactics ... but it used the change simply to make its own throttling policy more clear , not to alter it .
Change only came in the wake of FCC action and continuing Internet agitation .
So what says the hive mind : do we need regulatory action , will the marketplace keep companies from overreaching , or is the whole debate overblown ?
Despite the presence of these clauses , companies rarely act on the most restrictive ones .

Joe is being nice in his post below .
See , even when discussing what a frightful , awful , nasty mess Hillary has become , how she ’s even willing to race - bait Obama a la willy Horton , Joe is still too nice to use the M - word .
Lots of Democrats are too nice too .
Obama is too nice .
His staff is too nice .
His surrogates are too nice – note that Claire McCaskill did n’t detail even one Clinton scandal ( but you ’d better believe the Clintons will flay her alive , nonetheless ) .
Hell , even the blogs supporting Obama , and Netroots groups like MoveOn , are too nice .
None of these people want to mention Monica Lewinsky even when they ’re talking about the kind of nasty issues that Republicans will throw at Hillary in the fall .
That reticence , that decency that comes naturally and innately to non-Clinton Democrats is what Joe is talking about .
Hillary has n’t had to defend herself in years against all the Monica Lewinsky crap , against rumors about her husband , rumors about herself ( see , even I ’m being nice and hedging here by not giving you details about the rumors – but you can bet they ’re gonna go public in the fall ) , about Whitewater , Travelgate , Filesgate , cattle futures , and on and on .
When Hillary is pulling racist crap on Obama , trashing black churches , comparing him to Jesse Jackson , she likes to talk about how she ’s really doing it to help him and help the party – you see , she ’s preparing him for what ’s coming in the fall .
She ’s “ fully vetting ” him .
But who is fully vetting Hillary ?
The last time she came under the full onslaught of the right - wing conspiracy it destroyed her likability in the public eye , and made her one of the most hated Democrats in America .
And she ’s still paying a price today with horrendous disapproval ratings that she ’s been carrying for a decade .
If Hillary manages to steal the nomination , the Republicans are going to throw every Clinton scandal in her face , and then some – you can rest assured that they wo n’t be afraid to say the M - word .
And when the country is yet against forced to talk about Monica and oral sex 24/7 , Democrats will be looking back at Rev.

Every two months , Valentina visits about 30 men enrolled in San Francisco 's " john school " to tell them a sex story they do n't want to hear .
The men are part of the city 's First Offender Prostitution Program because they 've been arrested for soliciting a prostitute , usually in the Mission or Tenderloin .
If they agree to pay a $ 1,000 fee and spend a Saturday afternoon listening to sex - trafficking experts , neighborhood activists and doctors who subject them to photographs of venereal diseases , the district attorney 's office will drop the misdemeanor charge .
Valentina , a striking Russian woman with jet - black hair ( to protect her privacy , her full name is not given in this article ) , explains how she was molested from age 8 to 13 by a cousin ; how she was a full - blown alcoholic and heroin addict at 21 ; how she became an " escort " a year later , and by age 25 was working Mission Street .
She hated every interaction with every client .
" Sometimes I see it register on their faces , " said Valentina , 37 , a mother and San Francisco resident who 's been off the streets and sober for 10 years .
" The fantasy is n't what they thought .
... I do n't get much feedback from them .
I do my presentation and go about my day . "
Yet Valentina 's presentation as well as the other components of john school are effective , according to a study to be released in the coming weeks by the U.S. Department of Justice .
In the largest study of its kind , researchers concluded that men who attended San Francisco 's john school were 30 percent less likely to be rearrested for soliciting a prostitute than men who did not attend such a program .
Researchers compared data collected from 5,000 johns who completed the daylong class in San Francisco over the past 12 years with roughly 75,000 men arrested for soliciting prostitutes in California who did not attend john schools .
The costs of the school are covered by the men's fees , according to the district attorney 's office .
" The punch line is , these programs work , " said Michael Shively , a criminologist at Abt Associates , a Massachusetts - based research firm and the primary author of the two - year study commissioned by the National Institute of Justice .
" Some men are probably responding to the appeal of their own self interests , which in the class emphasizes the personal risk they face if they continue to involve themselves in prostitution .
And some men may be responding to the information conveyed about the harm they are causing the women they hire , and to the communities where the prostitution takes place . "
The study arrives at the same time Supervisor Jake McGoldrick asked for an audit of the city 's program , wondering if the arrests are worthwhile and the money for the program is being well spent .
He did not respond to messages seeking comment for this story .
When the First Offender Prostitution Program began in 1996 , it was considered a noble experiment in a progressive city .
Since then , 39 cities have modeled programs after San Francisco's .
The class was co-founded by Norma Hotaling , a former street prostitute arrested 30 times before she gained sobriety and started Standing Against Global Exploitation , a San Francisco group committed to ending commercial sexual traffic .
Hotaling said a San Francisco police officer who repeatedly arrested her was the first to suggest that her johns needed an education instead of jail time .
Hotaling recalled the advice and later developed the curriculum , which includes a six - hour course featuring multiple speakers who explain the negative impact prostitution has on women , their clients and the communities where it thrives .
More recently , Hotaling said , presentations have focused on global sex trafficking , to help men consider their role in the illegal phenomenon .
" The men who seek out prostitutes do n't like to think they 're part of exploiting someone , " Hotaling said .
" They like to believe it 's a victimless crime . "
Since the program 's inception , critics have wondered if the classes had any real impact on the men and the streets , Hotaling said .
Previous studies have shown that recidivism rates among men arrested for soliciting prostitutes is particularly low compared to other crimes , such as robbery .
Shively , the study 's author , said in San Francisco the recidivism rate for such men was about 8 percent before the program began .
Now , it rests at about 5 percent .
" It 's a significant drop if you consider it did n't have much further to go , " Shively said .
" The results are surprising . "
Anecdotally , the researchers also found that police departments reported street prostitution declined in the cities where the classes were available .
Shively said the study could not factor what role online prostitution may have played in reducing street prostitution in the past 12 years .
" But for some people , it 's good enough that street prostitution is out of their faces and behind closed doors , " Shively said , " where the entire community does n't have to deal with it . "
Robert Garcia , a member of Save Our Streets Tenants and Merchants Association in Lower Nob Hill , credits the john school program as helping to reduce street prostitution in his neighborhood near Post and Hyde streets .
As part of the agreement between Hotaling 's organization , which facilitates the school , and the district attorney 's office , which agrees to drop the charges , the Police Department is required to run eight sting operations per month designed to arrest the johns .
Last year , the department arrested 335 men , up from 130 in 2006 .
Garcia has monitored the Post and Hyde intersection near his home for about 20 years , and said he was skeptical the program would have any impact .
" This place used to be infested with prostitutes , " Garcia said .
" But we do n't see as many hanging out on the corners , and we do n't have as many cars circling the blocks , whistling and all that . "
Hotaling said the study 's results validate the once - experimental school , and hopes the city will expand the program .
" It does n't matter if they get picked up on the streets or through a new Web site that 's popped up , " Hotaling said .
" There 's always a need for the education . "
MOSCOW  Russia ’s state nuclear energy corporation is expected to switch off a nuclear reactor on Sunday in a closed city in Siberia .
The reactor has been producing weapons - grade plutonium for four decades , a senior American nonproliferation official said Saturday .
The reactor , ADE - 4 , is one of two in the city of Seversk that have been extraneous remnants of the Soviet Union ’s nuclear weapons program since the cold war .
For 15 years , they produced plutonium that the Kremlin neither needed nor wanted .
Opened in secret in the 1960s to feed the arms race , the reactors have continued to operate because of their peculiar construction as defense - industry suppliers .
The Defense Ministry stopped purchasing plutonium in 1993 , rendering the reactors ’ primary purpose obsolete .
But the reactors could not be closed , and plutonium was still produced , because the reactors were also a primary source of heat and power to the bitterly cold regions along the Tomsk River , where no equivalent utility sources had been built .
Internal investigators at the Port Authority are faulting the overwhelming bureaucracy surrounding the construction of the Freedom Tower for the loss of confidential blueprints that could have left the new building vulnerable to those determined to strike the WTC again .
Per the New York Post , " Experts say there was enough detail in the blueprints to lead to a devastating terrorist attack . "
Homeless man Mike Fleming found the 150 page document labeled " Secure Document -- Confidential " while sifting through a trash container on the corner of Sullivan St. and West Houston St. , and then turned it over to the Post .
The Port Authority actually has a 60 page guide on the proper control and disposal of confidential documents that does n't include instructions to toss them in a trash can on the street where anyone can pick them up .
And according to Newsday , one of the rules is that secure documents are not even supposed to be taken out in public , let alone left there .
Violations of security protocol could lead to someone at the Port Authority being fired or a construction company to lose its contract at the site .
In an editorial piece today , the Post excoriates the Port Authority for a blunder that resulted in the most detailed information about the building released to the public to date being discovered by a homeless recovering drug addict .
Fleming himself noted , " This could have ended up on eBay . "
Before sunrise on Tuesday morning , a strange sight began to appear on Fulton Ferry Landing in Brooklyn : a six - foot - tall metal drill bit seemed to emerge from the wooden pier , covered in genuine East River mud and revolving slowly beneath the glow of the Manhattan skyline .
On Wednesday it will grow into a 12 - foot - tall industrial - looking behemoth erupting just in front of the quaint Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory .
And on Thursday ?
Imagine an enormous brass and wood telescope , 37 feet long by 11 feet tall , connected to a mirrored dome , like a child ’s drawing of something that will see into the future .
Voilà : the Telectroscope will have materialized .
A fanciful device born equally of history and imagination , it will visually connect New Yorkers to people in London , where an identical scope will sit on the banks of the Thames in the shadow of Tower Bridge .
Spectators who step right up will have a real - time , life - size view across the pond 24 hours a day , until June 15 , thanks to ... no spoilers , yet .
( The queue will generally be first come first served , but to make an appointment to connect with a friend in London , visit telectroscope.net . )
The Victorian - looking contraption is the invention of Paul St George , a 53 - year - old artist based in London  or , if you believe the gadget ’s supposed history , of his great - grandfather Alexander Stanhope St George .
According to his very own fake Wikipedia entry , Alexander ( born July 8 , 1848 ; died Oct. 12 , 1917 ) was “ a British inventor and researcher ” who came up with a feasible design for a device to connect places on opposite sides of the world visually through a very long tunnel , and even began digging under the Atlantic to make his creation work .
According to Paul St George  well , all of this is according to Paul St George .
And some of it is true , sort of .
Mr. St George did have a relative named Alexander  his grandfather , a tailor .
The extra generation was added , as was the Stanhope ; it ’s the name of a type of magnifying lens .
And the Telectroscope is a real 19th - century creation  sort of .
It was written about , Mr. St George said , by a reporter who misheard a story about an electroscope , a device used to measure electrical current .
PHILADELPHIA ( Reuters ) - Authorities in Philadelphia will suspend foreclosure sales of homes whose owners have fallen behind on adjustable - rate subprime loan payments -- potential relief for tens of thousands of struggling debtors .
Sheriff John Green said on Friday he would halt sales of foreclosed properties in April and would seek a court order extending a moratorium for an unspecified period .
His action follows a nonbinding resolution passed unanimously by the Philadelphia City Council on Thursday calling on Green to stop the sales to give borrowers more time to seek a settlement that would prevent them from losing their homes .
Philadelphia becomes the first U.S. city to halt foreclosure sales in the current crisis , although Cleveland and Baltimore are considering similar measures , said ACORN , an advocacy group for low - income families .
The group said 45,470 subprime foreclosures are expected in Pennsylvania between the third quarter of 2007 and the end of 2009 .
Green , the sheriff of Philadelphia city and county , is trying to identify and track homeowners with weak credit histories who took out the loans with initially low repayments but who are no longer able to afford them because their rates have adjusted sharply higher .
Such loans are expected to lead to a flood of foreclosures throughout the United States this year , and have led to severe losses among financial firms trading in securities backed by the mortgages .
ACORN estimates 2.2 million mortgage loans will go into foreclosure in 2008 due to the subprime crisis .
“ Given the severity and complexity of mortgage foreclosures , a moratorium will allow for more time to identify and help distressed home owners , ” Green said in a statement .
The resolution said 3,206 “ high - cost ” mortgage loans made in 2006 are likely to enter foreclosure in Philadelphia , representing losses totaling $ 345 million to homeowners , lenders , and local government , as well as falling home values .
Lenders would take about $ 158 million in losses ; homeowners $ 23 million ; and local government $ 62 million if the foreclosures go ahead , the council ’s resolution said .
A spokesman for ACORN called on lenders to work with Philadelphia on the policy to help find a solution and avoid a lengthy moratorium .
Home prices in the Philadelphia region appreciated at a 2.04 percent rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 , down from 6.74 percent at the end of 2006 and 14.3 percent in 2005 , according to quarterly reports from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight .
Across the nation , home prices fell 3 percent in January from a year earlier , the federal agency said .
In defense of its action , the council also said foreclosures increase violent crime in affected neighborhoods , hurt property values and reduce city tax revenue .
Yajaira Rivera , a mother of four , said she took out a $ 106,000 mortgage on her Philadelphia home with GMAC in February 2005 and expected to pay $ 920 a month .
Instead , she was presented with an initial payment demand of $ 1,235 , which increased to $ 1,671 before she negotiated a lower payment .
She still cannot make the payments , so her home is scheduled to be sold by the sheriff on May 6 , meaning the April moratorium will not cover her unless it is extended .
“ The reality is that it has only bought us a window of 30 days , ” she said .
Local and national branches of the Mortgage Bankers Association did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment on the Philadelphia plan .

An old tractor tyre makes a fantastic sandpit for the younger set , and is a super easy recycling project .
Old tractor tyres are easier to come by than you may think .
I got hold of this one by putting a “ Wanted ” ad on Freecycle and a local smallholder was happy to part with it , I just had to pick it up .
For this you need two strong people and a roof - rack on your car , or a trailer .
The hardest part of this project is definitely getting the large tyre home , but once you ’ve got that out of the way , it ’s plain sailing .
Step - by - step instructions :
Step 1 : Acquire an old tractor tyre .
I recommend giving Freecycle a try , or if you know a farmer , ask him .
Step 2 : Scrub the tyre well with a scrubbing brush and some soapy water .
Step 3 : Dig out a section of lawn to fit the tyre into .
Aim for getting about 1/2 of the width of the tyre into the ground .
Step 4 : Once the tyre is in place , dig out the middle some more , go about a foot and a half down to make room for the sand .
Step 5 : Fill with sand .
You can buy sand specifically for sandpits from garden centres .
Little , it seems , can stem the tide of false news and rampant speculation that comes our way from tabloids and news sources in general .
There are some obvious culprits and some less so – but overall , there ’s a lot that ’s published in the papers with the deliberate intention of misleading the readers ( whether the motivation is to create false news to gain more readers or to carry out a vendetta against a particular point of view or person ) .
There ’s little one can do to stop this – but in some very rare cases ( such as today ) the offended party stands up and smacks the offender upside on the head with the threat of a lawsuit .
On Sunday , March 2nd 2008 , Duncan Castles in the Observer claimed that Chelsea manager Avram Grant had been deliberately and repeatedly snubbed by his players , who ( if memory serves – the original article is of course now deleted by the Guardian ) told him to go away when he them during the players ’ meeting , and was met with silence when the meeting with the manager actually happened .
Such claims do little in terms of informing readers – there ’s hardly any solid information to go on here and as such we ’re being told to believe someone ’s speculation on a single piece of information – that Grant had to wait a few minutes for the players ’ meeting to be finished , which presumably took longer than expected .
They do a lot to damage the reputation of the people involved – in this case Avram Grant and Chelsea FC – and similarly do a lot for bringing readers to the rumour - monger in question .
The apology printed by the Observer is hardly worth the time it took to write it , and removing the original article ( instead of putting an apology on that page as well ) is just another way of burying their own mistakes .
Now if I was the speculative kind , I would say that this rumour was just retaliation from the Guardian after Avram Grant criticised the media earlier that week for having an agenda against him at Chelsea .
More likely though , it was just a symptom of journalists trying to get a feel for public opinion and feeding that with concocted news ( in this case , the anger at Chelsea ’s defeat in the Carling Cup final ) .
If the Guardian was serious about cleaning up their act ( and it needs desperate cleaning up ) , they would put the likes of Daniel Taylor and Duncan Castles on notice , establish strong guidelines for their bloggers and writers to differentiate between opinion and fact , and as a general rule avoid baseless speculation .
No one ’s perfect ( least of all us bloggers ) , but perhaps we can work on holding ourselves up to higher standards than the Guardian writers currently hold themselves to ?
Emotional memories of traumatic life events such as accidents , war experiences or serious illnesses are stored in a particularly robust way by the brain .
This renders effective treatment very difficult .
Researchers at ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich have now successfully tracked down the molecular bases of these strong , very persistent memories .
The expression “ post - traumatic stress disorder ” is once again constantly on everyone ’s lips in relation to those returning from the Iraq war or survivors of catastrophes such as the tsunami .
This is not a new development , since it always occurs when people experience extreme situations .
It is known that emotional memories of both a positive and a negative kind are stored by our brain in a particularly robust way .
Consequently they have a very large effect on our behaviour and , in the case of adverse memories , they can place considerable restrictions on the way we go about our lives .
As a result , we avoid places , smells or objects that remind us of the traumatic experience , because they may trigger severe anxieties .
Isabelle Mansuy , Professor of Cellular Neurobiology at ETH Zurich and of Molecular and Cognitive Neurosciences at the University of Zurich , and her research group have now shown that the enzyme calcineurin and the gene regulation factor Zif268 decisively determine the intensity of emotional memories .
For the first time , this has enabled the regulatory processes at the synapse , which are important for emotional memories , to be linked to the processes in the cell nucleus .
Mice as an ideal model system
The generation of very persistent memories in the shortest possible time needs molecules in the brain that are not only activated rapidly but which also efficiently control the signalling pathways of long - term information storage in the brain .
This is why the protein phosphatase calcineurin , which was already known to have a negative regulatory effect on learning and memory , was a very promising candidate for the Zurich researchers .
The researchers used mice as the model system because their learning processes are very similar to those in humans , and established behavioural tests already exist .
In their experiments , the researchers conditioned the mice to associate a sugar solution with nausea .
This association persists for many months .
The mice avoid the sugar solution during this period .
However , their aversion can be overcome slowly through intensive training .
Mansuy explains that “ Emotional memories are not simply erased .
Oppressive negative memories need to be actively replaced by positive memories . ”
She says it is important at the same time to understand that the negative memories do not disappear , they merely slide down in a kind of priority list and are outweighed by the newly learned positive memories .
Mansuy says
“ This process is not final and absolute , since the priority list can change again . ”
Karsten Baumgärtel , a post - doctoral researcher in Mansuy ’s group , stresses that this is a big difference between emotional memories and learned knowledge .
“ It is entirely possible for facts to vanish completely from the memory , whereas in extreme cases emotional recollections remain stored for a whole lifetime .
Active intervention is necessary to reduce the priority level of negative memories . ”
Reduced calcineurin activity
Studies of the amygdala , that part of the brain which is important for emotional perception , showed reduced activity of the enzyme calcineurin in conditioned mice compared to mice in which no association with nausea had been generated .
Because calcineurin is a negative regulator of learning and memory , its activity needs to be reduced to enable strong memorisation .
To gain more evidence about the role of calcineurin in the memory process , the researchers used transgenic mice in which they were able to selectively activate or deactivate the enzyme in nerve cells of the brain .
Mansuy explains that “ This selective activation and inactivation in nerve cells is important because calcineurin is an enzyme that occurs in many cells .
For example it also plays an important part in the immune defence system . ”
As the researchers expected , inactivating calcineurin strengthened the memory of the association between sugar solution and nausea , whereas the memory was weakened by increased calcineurin activity .
The researchers were also able to demonstrate that the period of time needed to suppress the negative memory by a purely positive memory could be prolonged or shortened respectively by this intervention .
Regulation processes in synapses and the cell nucleus
Inactivating calcineurin also causes increased expression of the gene regulator Zif268 in the amygdala .
Zif268 is responsible for regulating a wide variety of important genes that play a role in the signal processing of memories and learning .
Simulating this increased expression of Zif268 in transgenic mice intensified memory in a similar way to the inactivation of calcineurin .
This is the first occasion on which it has been possible to demonstrate this magnitude of functional relationship between the activity of an enzyme in the synapse and that of a gene regulation factor in the cell nucleus .
Mansuy and Baumgärtel stress that the purpose of their research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the molecular relationships , but that it is not associated in any way with a direct clinical application in the near future .
However , Mansuy explains that : “ In the past , the origin of many diseases was unknown and they were regarded as a punishment from God , and at that time those who were affected went to the priest .
Nowadays we understand the mechanisms underlying them and can treat these illnesses .
We hope that our research has made a small contribution to enabling the same situation also to apply in the future to psychological traumas or brain diseases with memory weakness such as Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s and strokes . ”
Even though I have KOed two of these motors ( 2nd Gen RX - 7 ) I still love them .
I alsoshould n't say KO to bothof them the first had an excuse , 214,000 miles .
It was the oil seals that made me shut that motor down .
BTW that motor still pulled like no other even with raw oil shooting out of the tailpipes .
My last hoon in that car was on a clear night at about 11:00 PM .
At about 11:15 PM the night was no longer clear .
The second motor tweaked after racing a 96 mustang .
Yes I won , but took out one of the housings in the process .
I still love the cars and weep every time I see one in the j - yard .
For the American Left , there are many reasons to withdraw from Iraq : we ’re caught in the middle of a sectarian civil war , the Iraqi government is a perfidious ally , Iraq is a diversion from the real war against al Qaeda in Afghanistan , and so on .
Some of these arguments are strategically shortsighted , others are based on false premises ( such as the fact that the sectarian civil war is over in Iraq and bin Laden is in Pakistan , not Afghanistan ) , but at least they are more or less logically coherent .
What makes almost no sense is the proposal that we turn success in Iraq into defeat so that we can “ fix the military . ”
Fixing the “ broken ” military is a reliable campaign talking point for both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama ; the Democrats have embraced the idea that soldiers are a new constituency in their Coalition of the Victimized .
Obama ’s victory speech after the South Carolina primary in January grouped soldiers and their families with “ the mother who ca n’t get Medicaid for her sick child , ” the “ teacher who works another shift at Dunkin Donuts ” and the “ Maytag worker who is now competing with his own teenager for a $ 7 - an - hour job at Walmart . ”
The fix - the - military argument was recently made at greater length by the New York Times .
On May 18 , the paper ’s editorialists noted that the efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan have taken a serious toll on the Army and Marine Corps , wearing down not only people but equipment “ at an unprecedented rate . ”
Well , the loss rates would not have been surprising to the defenders of Bastogne , the armies at Antietam , or the servicemen and women in any other major war , but it is true that US land forces have been asked to do too much with too little for too long .
The question is how we should respond to this fact .
The Times and its anti-war allies argue that the remedy is not to expand the force to meet the wartime mission , but to reduce the mission to what a small force can handle , consistent with a decent family life , defense budgets constrained to historic lows and peacetime recruitment and promotion “ standards . ”
In other words , let ’s not fix the problem .
Let ’s give up .
*
The Army and the Marines are indeed under great stress , but , as service leaders , officers , and sergeants - major take great pains to explain , they are far from broken .
If anything , the tactical performance and discipline of US forces in the field has improved significantly in recent years .
The Iraq surge is a case study of counterinsurgency warfare planned and executed brilliantly .
Broken forces do not conduct such operations .
From the level of team and squad to supreme command , US forces have adapted themselves remarkably to a war they were not at first ready to fight .
In retrospect what is remarkable is how resilient and flexible the all - volunteer , professional force has proven to be .
The compelling reason to reinvest in America ’s Army and Marine Corps is not to withdraw and prepare for the “ next war , ” but to build land forces capable of sustaining and prevailing in the so - called “ Long War , ” the effort to secure more legitimate governments , and thus a more durable stability , in vital regions like the Persian Gulf .
So what does a Long War land force look like ?
To begin with , it ’s bigger .
Much bigger :
We need a total active - duty Army and Marine Corps of about one million .
That is almost exactly the same as the two land services were at the end of the Cold War , but it ’s a lot more than the total of about 700,000 , and much more than the 750,000 called for by the Bush Administration ’s plan – a plan , by the way , endorsed by Obama .
John McCain has recommended an expansion to 900,000 .
( So who ’s for “ staying the course ” ? )
This larger Long War force must also be durable .
This places a premium on active - duty , long - service professionals .
Irregular warfare calls for regulars , not conscripts .
Those who advocate a return to the draft want to end the war , not win it .
The next president should do what President Bush has not : Ask Americans to serve the nation in uniform .
This is a matter not only of moral conscience , but military effectiveness .
The alleys of Baghdad or the hills of Helmand are not places to deploy draftees .
The next president would also be wise to increase incentives for career officers and NCOs .
In fact , the greatest career incentives would be to expand the size and modernize the equipment of the force ; victory is the greatest reward for soldiering .
The demand for durability also means clarifying , as best we can , the distinct roles of the Army and the Marine Corps .
To fix the Marines , first fix the Army .
As retired Marine Lieutenant General – and former New York Times military correspondent – Bernard Trainor recently wrote , “ Marines have been almost indistinguishable from the Army for the past five years of the Iraq war .
Marines repeatedly must supplement our shorthanded Army , which cannot satisfy its assignments unassisted . ”
Restructuring and repairing the Army will allow the Marine Corps to resume its traditional – and still critical – function as a sea - based expeditionary force .
Fixing the active Army would also alleviate the burdens on the National Guard , which is also almost indistinguishable from the active force .
*
US land forces must also be flexible forces ; in Pentagonese , they must be “ full - spectrum forces . ”
More specifically , it means that conventional or general - purpose units must be sometimes as adept at delivering community services as delivering firepower .
Creating unique “ peacekeeping ” or “ advisory ” units is both unwise and unaffordable and would distort the structure of the services .
Nor , alternatively , is it an option to pretend that irregular warfare missions are not a legitimate , “ warfighting ” task .
We also need to modernize land - force equipment ; technology should be as energetically applied to transform the conduct of land warfare .
The difference wo n’t be seen in better tanks , although we will naturally need new generations of land combat vehicles , but to better link US land forces in a network .
The battlefield will not become totally transparent , but it can be made less opaque .
And what will still be a small force must make the most of its most valuable assets – the individual , dismounted soldier or Marine whose job it is , in an unfamiliar place and culture , to distinguish friend from foe and whose most important decision may be when not to fire .
Finally , the need to balance strategic risks means that the other services must take on a variety of other missions .
These may be part of the Long War – such as providing unmanned aerial vehicle coverage or maritime patrol off the Horn of Africa – or entirely different , such as hedging against China ’s growing military power .
That , too , is part of facing the world as it is rather than imagining the world as we would wish it to be .
The total cost of an 800,000 - strong active duty Army , expanded , modernized , and restructured to the extent that we advocate , would be about $ 240 billion – a substantial sum , to be sure .
Yet the Congressional Budget Office predicts that by 2017 – about the year by which , in our estimate , such an expansion could be complete – the U.S. GDP will exceed $ 21 trillion .
Thus , the total burden of the expanded force , by the time the process neared completion , would remain at less than 1.2 percent of the projected GDP .
In the end , the Left ca n’t have it both ways .
America ’s volunteer soldiers and Marines are not victims to be rescued but fighting men and women who should be supported .
“ Supporting the troops ” does not mean legislating defeat , delaying the appropriation of funds they desperately need , or attempting to micromanage the conflict from Washington .
America should provide better benefits to its servicemen and women both in uniform and retired , should offer a new GI bill , and in general should treat the very best Americans as well as they deserve to be treated .
But advocating such measures while working actively to force the military to accept a defeat it has not earned in the name of allowing it to “ reset ” for another conflict that we must not ever fight is not supporting the troops .
It ’s just political camouflage .
The reason to rebuild and reshape America ’s land forces is to give them the means to win the critical wars we ’re fighting now , not to retreat into some self - realization exercise measured by high - school diplomas , home - station “ dwell times ” or predictable promotions .
“ Readiness , ” in a military context , means being ready to fight .
Our military has been fighting for seven years now .
It ’s past time to get ready to win the war we ’re fighting now .

EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. — Robert De Niro has shown up to pitch for Barack Obama , just as the rumor had it , here at the Izod Center at the Meadowlands .
He ’s looking sporty in a blue blazer .
" Barack Obama does not have the experience to be president of the United States " is his opening line .
For one thing : " He was n’t experienced enough to authorize the invasion of Iraq . "
" And that ’s not all , ” he went on .
“ It ’s clear Barack Obama does not have the experience to let the special interests run the government . "

The crowd ( which takes up 5/28 ths of just the lower tier of seating in the 30,000 seat arena , so you know , a big crowd , but not a big , big crowd ) is jazzed .
This rhetorical device goes on for a bit .
" That ’s the kind of inexperience I can get used to , " said DeNiro .
" I ’ve never made a speech like this at a political event before , " he said .
" Sooo , what am I doing here ? "
" Finally , one person has inspired me , " he said .
Guess who !
" Lemme just speak to you young people here , " he continued .
" The rest of you can listen –it ’s okay .
I ’ve been concerned that so many of you are n’t voting ….
No one inspired you .
You wanted to vote , you just did n’t have anyone you wanted to vote for .

The initiative follows rioting on the streets of Lhasa in Tibet China has launched an " education " campaign in Tibet it says is designed to undermine support for the Dalai Lama and any separatist sentiment .
The Tibet Daily newspaper said the campaign was to " unify the thinking ... of officials and the masses " .
The initiative follows violent clashes last month between police and monks in Tibet , and pro-Tibetan demonstrations around the world .
Beijing has accused the Dalai Lama of inciting unrest - claims he has denied .
The Tibetan spiritual leader , who lives in exile in India , insists he has no political role and played no part in the protests by Tibetan Buddhist monks that erupted into rioting in the main city Lhasa .
But he condemned the Chinese crackdown that followed , and accused Beijing of committing " cultural genocide " in Tibet .
Tibetan sympathisers and human rights activists have since used the worldwide tour of the Olympic torch to protest against Beijing 's hosting of the Olympic Games this August .
Security tightened China 's Communist Party has long used what it calls " patriotic education campaigns " to impose discipline and reinforce its authority , says the BBC's Daniel Griffiths in Beijing .
The Tibet Daily says the latest drive will include television programmes and a series of sessions in which the Dalai Lama will be denounced by Communist Party members , other officials and local people .
Campaigns requiring monks in Tibetan monasteries to denounce the Dalai Lama and declare their loyalty to Beijing have also been stepped up .
China has poured troops into Tibet and tightened its borders ahead of the passage of the Olympic flame through the territory , on its way to Mount Everest in early May .
It accuses the Dalai Lama of wanting to divide Tibet from China and sabotage the Olympics .
France targeted Protests have recently erupted in China to counter those that have accompanied the torch relay in the West .

Sarkozy tries to mend China ties
The French supermarket company Carrefour has been targeted with an attempted boycott for allegedly supporting the Dalai Lama - though it has denied doing so .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy apologised in a letter to a disabled Chinese athlete who was jostled as she carried the Olympic torch in Paris , in an apparent attempt to soothe ties with China .
However , Paris city council has said it will give the Dalai Lama honorary citizenship .
Bertrand Delanoe , the city 's Socialist mayor , said the gesture would " pay tribute to a champion of peace - a tireless advocate of dialogue between peoples " .

What are these ?
If the exit polls ( and the pre-election polls ) are accurate , Hillary Clinton is set to win West Virginia by roughly a 2 to 1 margin over Barack Obama .
Oregon , next Tuesday , favors Obama .
But Kentucky , which votes the same day , seems likely to yield a similar margin for Sen. Clinton .
So what is it about these two states that makes them so favorable to Hillary Clinton ?
There ’s been a lot of talk in this campaign about Barack Obama ’s problem with working class white voters or rural voters .
But these claims are both inaccurate because they are incomplete .
You can look at states like Virginia , Ohio , Pennsylvania and other states and see the different numbers and they are all explained by one basic fact .
Obama ’s problem is n’t with white working class voters or rural voters .
It ’s Appalachia .
That explains why Obama had a difficult time in Ohio and Pennsylvania and why he ’s getting crushed in West Virginia and Kentucky .
If it were just a matter of rural voters or the white working class , the pattern would show up in other regions .
But by and large it does not .
In so many words , Pennsylvania and Ohio have big chunks of Appalachia within their borders .
But those regions are heavily offset by non-Appalachian sections that are cultural and demographically distinct .
West Virginia is 100 % Appalachian .
If you look at southeastern Ohio or the middle chunk of Pennsylvania , Obama did about the same as he ’s doing tonight in West Virginia .
Below is a map of the Appalachian counties stretching from New York down into Mississippi .
Below that is a map of counties that Hillary Clinton has won by more than 65 % .
As you can see match up quite closely — the grey gaps are Kentucky and West Virginia which had n’t voted yet .
So what is it about this region ?
Let me offer a series of overlapping explanations .
First , some basic demographics .
It ’s widely accepted that Hillary Clinton does better with older voters , less educated voters and white voters .
These demographics perfectly match West Virginia — and , more loosely , the entire Appalachian region .
A few key points from tonight ’s exit polls demonstrate the point : 4 out of 10 voters were over 60 years of age .
7 out of 10 lacked a college degree — the highest proportion of any electorate in the country .
And 95 % of the electorate was white .
Basically you have a state that is made up almost exclusively of Clinton ’s voters .
But there ’s a deeper historical explanation that we have to apply as well — one nicely illustrated by the origins of West Virginia itself .
During the 18th and 19th centuries , in the middle Atlantic and particularly in the Southern states , there was a long - standing cleavage between the coastal and ‘ piedmont ’ regions on the one hand and the upcountry areas to the west on the other .
It ’s really the coastal lowlands and the Appalachian districts .
On the other side of the Appalachian mountain range the pattern is flipped , with the Appalachians in the east and the lowlands in the west .
These regions were settled disproportionately by Scots - Irish immigrants who pushed into the hill country to the west in part because that ’s where the affordable land was but also because they wanted to get away from the more stratified and inegalitarian society of the east which was built by English settlers and their African slaves .
Crucially , slavery never really took root in these areas .
And this is why during the Civil War , Unionism ( as in support for the federal union and opposition to the treason of secession ) ran strong through the Appalachian upcountry , even into Deep South states like Alabama and Mississippi .
As I alluded to earlier , this was the origin of West Virginia , which was originally the westernmost part of Virginia .
The anti-slavery , anti-slaveholding upcountry seceded from Virginia to remain in the Union after Virginia seceded from the Union .
Each of these regions was fiercely anti-Slavery .
And most ended up raising regiments that fought in the Union Army .
But they were as anti-slave as they were anti-slavery , both of which they viewed as the linchpins of the aristocratic and inegalitarian society they loathed .
It was a society that was both more violent and more self - reliant .
This is history .
But it shapes the region .
It ’s overwhelmingly white , economically underdeveloped ( another legacy of the pre-civil war pattern ) and arguably because of that underdevelopment has very low education rates and disproportionately old populations .
For all these reasons , if you ’re familiar with the history , it ’s really no surprise that Barack Obama would have a very hard time running in this region .

BBC News , Los Angeles , California
In a large , featureless convention centre 40 miles east of Los Angeles , more than 1,000 people have gathered early on a Sunday morning .
From the stage , they are addressed in earnest by a man in tuxedo and bow tie , and they can watch the proceedings on giant video screens on either side of him .
He is preaching property , and although this auctioneer 's high - speed patter sounds more like a cattle auction , here they are bidding for homes .
More than 100 houses are up for sale here and every two to three minutes a property goes under the hammer .
Similar auctions of repossessed houses are taking place nearly every weekend in California , where banks are cutting their losses from millions of dollars of bad debt .
Care required
There are bargains to be had .
One man says he paid $ 375,000 for a house valued at $ 616,000 .
Estate agent Julie Bruckner says homes need love Lot 132 was a five - bedroom family home with a pool and three - car garage on La Salle Circle , Corona , a pleasant middle - class suburban community east of Los Angeles .
It was expected to fetch some $ 400,000 .
In the end Cornelius Foster and Debra Moore paid $ 500,000 for it ; still less than the $ 700,000 it was originally valued at .
" We 're very excited , " Cornelius says .
" It 's got a pool and we 're looking forward to getting in and fixing it up .
" I 'm smiling today . "
Yet they are also aware of the house 's history .
" We feel bad for the people that were there before , " Ms Moore says .
It was a reminder of how , behind many a good deal , there often lies a tale of personal distress .
Jeannette Lovell says prices have fallen fast
In one house on La Salle Circle , two days before its auction , an estate agent 's sign outside proudly proclaims " selling the American Dream since 1969 " .
But , as estate agent Julie Bruckner tours the property with its chandelier in the living room and a huge walk - in closet upstairs , she is well aware of a poignant irony .
" There are so many in this area that are vacant .
" This home definitely needs some love , and a family that can give it the TLC [ tender loving care ] it needs . "
Graffiti and crime
In fact the Corona area has the third highest rate of foreclosures , or repossessions , in the United States .
" Selling the American Dream " On La Salle Circle at least three properties were empty , awaiting sale .
One local resident is Jeanette Lovell , a British expat .
She and her husband are not in mortgage difficulties , yet she was still worried about her own home 's value .
" We may have to relocate for my husband 's job , " Ms Lovell says .
" And I know that our house has lost $ 150,000 in value in 18 months - if we can sell it at all . "
These are the ripples of the housing crisis : just 2 % of America 's mortgages are actually in foreclosure ; just under 6 % are said to be " delinquent " , meaning payments are late by 30 days or more .
Yet Cindy Robinson , another resident of La Salle Circle , predicts more problems : " You get graffiti , " she says .
" And then white collar crime . "
Duty of care
Two doors down , another repossessed house has just been vacated .
Auctioned houses are seen as bargains by investors
Whoever had lived there had clearly left in a hurry : the floors littered with unwanted documents , clothes and children 's ' toys ; a door is hanging from one hinge in the kitchen .
There are cockroaches and mouse droppings and part of the ceiling has caved in through water damage .
A local politician in the Corona area has proposed laws requiring banks and other companies that repossess properties to be responsible for their upkeep .
The measure would give county authorities the power to levy fines on lenders that fail to maintain empty homes in keeping with the properties around them .
It has yet to be voted upon , although similar laws are in place in other parts of the country .
Lucrative auctions
Back at the auction , most of the buyers seem to be amateur investors , with a varying degree of sympathy for those whose homes they have just bought .
Auction winners hope to profit from their bets
Some are critical of those who had overstretched themselves in the housing market , others more focussed on the opportunities for them to make money from repossessed housing stock .
All seem confident they could turn a profit , that auction prices perhaps reflect a truer value , and that the rental market will stay strong while the crisis continues .
Meanwhile some are making money right now .
With experts predicting the number of foreclosures could carry on rising for at least the next six months , the auction companies know that theirs , at least , is a growth industry .

What are these ?
A team of Canadian researchers has completed a massive survey of the network of protein complexes that orchestrate the fundamental processes of life .
In the online edition of the journal Science , researchers from the Université de Montréal describe protein complexes and networks of complexes never before observed -- including two implicated in the normal mechanisms by which cells divide and proliferate and another that controls recycling of the molecular building blocks of life called autophagy .
These processes are implicated in diseases such as cancers and autophagy has recently been shown to be involved in degenerative neurological disorders such as Alzheimer 's and Huntington 's diseases .
The discovery will fill gaps in basic knowledge about the workings and evolutionary origins of the living cell and provide new avenues to explore in linking these fundamental processes to human disease .
The study was led by Stephen Michnick , a Université de Montréal biochemistry professor and Canada Research Chair in Integrative Genomics , along with Université de Montréal co-first authors : Kirill Tarassov , Vincent Messier , Christian Landry and Stevo Radinovic .
Collaborators from McGill 's Department of Biology included Canadian genomics pioneer Prof. Howard Bussey and Prof. Jackie Vogel .
" Our team systematically analyzed the interactions of proteins of bakers yeast , a unicellular organism confirmed to provide insight into fundamental processes shared by most living cells including those of humans , " explained Prof. Michnick .
New technology makes discovery possible
The examination of protein complexes was made possible by a unique technology developed by Prof .
Michnick with his post - doctoral fellows and graduate students .
The novel technology allows interactions between proteins to be studied in their nearly natural state in the cell .
With this technology , the scientists performed approximately 15 million pair - wise tests to identify about 3,000 interactions between protein pairs .
Since protein - to - protein association largely defines their function , this is a major advancement towards scientific understanding of the inner life of human cells .
Thanks to Prof .
Michnick 's technology , the researchers also uncovered the architecture of protein complexes -- key information necessary to determine how proteins work together to orchestrate complex biochemical processes .
" The technologies and resources developed for this study can be applied to investigate protein networks in more complex organisms including crop plant and human cells , " said Prof.
Michnick .
" They may also be used to link multiple genes implicated in complex human diseases to common cellular processes .
What 's more , applications to diagnostic tests and the development of drugs and antibodies against human cancers can be readily envisioned . "
Professor Michnick 's research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR ) , Institute of Genetics and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ( NSERC ) .
The research was also funded by Genome Canada and Génome Québec .
